How much money do you want to spend?  ;-)

Let's pick the Army Enigma.

3 rotors picked from a set of 5, and stacked on the axle. 
[60 possibilities]

26 possible positions for each rotor
[26^3 = 17576 possibilities]

Five pairs of letters swapped by the plugboard: choose ten letters,
pick an ordering of them, plug cable 1 into the first two, cable 2
into the second two etc.  But I could plug the cables in in any
permutation so I'm 5! times too big.  But the cables are bidirectional
so I'm 2 times too big.
[(26 choose 10) times 10! divided by (2*5!)  = 15120 cable settings.]

265749120 possible keys.

That's only 2^27.

Direct search of the Enigma keyspace is apparently feasible on modern
parallel computers.  Assuming I got (a) the number of cables right and
(b) got the number of possible cable-swaps right

This assumes unknown-plaintext!  With a known-plaintext attack we are
much luckier, and can do a bombe-type attack before searching the
plugboard space; this puts the Enigma in reach of a PC-XT.

Which isn't surprising, since the Enigma was in reach of people in the
1940s who just had electric motors and metal relays.

I made the following recording from a 3-rotor German Enigma.

			 plaintext: michael tighe
 		        ciphertext: djrxyxs qvail

Rotor setting was 01/01/01

left-to-right rotor ordering was 3/2/1.

The middle rotor had a notch on 5, and the right rotor had a notch on 17.

The plugboard was wired as: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
                            EYCFADHGOKJMLNIWQSRUTZPXBV

The Enigma is actually a complicated machine. I didn't really know exactly
how it worked until I had one in hand and could take it apart and see how
it worked mechanically. All of what I had read about it was either
incorrect or incomplete. Even some of the information the Smithsonian
Institute and the NSA states in their museums is incorrect. I can't imagine
how hard it was to break 50+ years ago. What an accomplishment that was.

It was a fun experience writing code that could 'talk' to it. I have been
meaning to getting around to writing a 'bombe' but haven't had the time.
Hopefully this summer.

Good luck,

On the other hand, allow it to encrypt an A to an A might allow
portions of the message to "seep through". I suppose the chances
of a full word "seeping through" are probably low, but it would still
worry me.

It seems to me, that the only advantage to routing the current back through
the rotors, is to foil those who have no knowlege of the rotor wirings.
After the wiring is known, I cannot see any benefit.  Actually, I take
that back... it does one more thing- it puts the current through the
steckerboard twice.

I believe that the real reason it was fed in, and then back thru
the rotors was because of its economic design. The keys and the lamps were
all connected to the stecker/and same end of the rotors. This gave it its
capability to both encode and decode.  A one way route through the rotors
would (I think) create an encrypt/decrypt only mechanism.

The machine is amazingly simple... take the following circuit, and
then add a plug board and a few rotors to scramble the connections.

                                                                      |

In the above diagram, you can see how a pressed key, can light any other
lamp (any but its own).  All that was needed was a scrambling apparatus
in between. This leads to a couple of other possible "abusive" situation
properties:

	1. If two keys are pressed at the same time, and they scramble
	   to different letters, then two lamps light.

	1. If two keys are pressed, and the scramble to each other, then
	   no lamps light (+ to +, thus no current flow).

I have got my PC full screen mockup of the ENIGMA going, but I am still in
search of the authentic rotor wirings. I am in the process of obtaining
books that might help.  If someone out there has the BASIC program that
was mentioned for the ENIGMA, please pass it along.  I'd like to see
what rotor wirings they used in it.

I am also led to assume, that the rotor advanced its position AFTER the
key was pressed (and subsequently released). Is this in fact the case?

According to Kahn's "Seizing the Enigma" the Germans set the rotors so
that they would kick the neighboring rotor at different points, not
necessarily when they had made a full rotation.
	The British devised a slogan for this: "Royal Flags Wave Kings
Above" as a mnenomic for when the rotors kicked their neighbors.
	"Rotor I, for example, kicked its neighbor when it (rotor
I) stepped to ring position R (from ring position Q) during the
course of encipherment. Rotor II gave its kick when moving to F, III
to W, IV to K and V to A. The Germans thought that this would create a
more irregular movement and in a way they were right. But the British
cryptanalysts soon saw that the discovery that a rotor had moved
could, if they knew the ring position of its neighr to the right,
identify that neighbor."

1. I selected the standard alphabet to be on the RHS of the rotors
as this is the side where the first (right most) rotor has its input
connections from the stator connected to the plugboard. Viewing
both the rotors and the reflector from the RHS, the alphabets are 
progressing clockwise. You are normally looking at the reflector
from the RHS as this is where it has its connection pins. The LHS
has no connections.

I should perhaps clarify one point in my note no. 3. It is only the
"thin reflectors", those used in the Naval Enigma M4, that has contact
pads, the normal (thick) reflectors have contact pins. The reason for
the pads on the thin reflectors is the need for having a very thin
construction to fit in the available space. However, this means that
the Greek rotors Beta and Gamma have contact pins on both sides.

3. The wiring of the rotors was measured with a buzzer "ringing"
through the different connections. First the alphabet ring was
put in its neutral position, letter A opposite the neutral mark on
the rotor body. Next one pole of the buzzer was connected to the
RHS contact pin in the letter A position and the other pole touching
the contact pads on the LHS until one pad was found that made contact.
For rotor I this would be the contact pad in the letter E position.
I hope this clarifies the rotor wirings.

4. For rotor I, when Q appears in the window the notch Y (notch in
the letter Y position) is in the engaged position and the left hand
neighbouring rotor will step forward on the next key press.

5. The rotors move towards the operator, which means counter clockwise
seen from the RHS of the machine. This counter clockwise movement will
show each letter on the rotor's alphabet ring in a normal progression
A,B,C, etc.

>	6...	Does the rotor advance during the INITIAL key
>		press, or AFTER key release?

6. The rotor will move towards the end of the excursion of a key.
During the first 1/3 of the displacement of a key no rotor movement
takes place. The rotor will move during the next 2/3 displacement
and the rotor has reached its new position at the end of the key
movement.

Concerning my earlier posting about the rotor turnover, somebody
remarked that I had forgot to deal with the Naval rotors VI, VII and
VIII, which have two notches in position H and U, diametrically
opposite. The Naval rotor do not in any way modify the double stepping
anomaly, only that double stepping can take place more frequently.
It also means that the rotor to the left of one of the 2-notch
rotors will move twice (every 13 steps) for each full revolution of
the 2-notch rotor.

The use of 2-notch rotors will unfortunately reduce the period of the
machine. If a 2-notch rotor is installed in the right most position 
the period will be reduced from 16900 characters to 8450. If it is
installed in the middle position it will give a period of 8112, while
if two of the 2-notch rotors are used we will end up with a period
of only 4056. A 2-notch rotor in the 3rd (left most) position will 
behave as a normal rotor as the Greek rotor does not have a stepping
lever that can engage the notches.

I will send this reply as a follow-up article as I understand you
have some problems with UUCP, and a clarification of the Enigma
rotor turnover might have a general interest. 

I used the expression "double advancement anomoly" which perhaps is
not a very good description of what is actually happening. Using the
word "double" I ment to say that the middle rotor moves ONE step
forward together with the third rotor, the middle rotor will not step
twice, for a single key press. The key to the understanding of this
mechanism is that the middle rotor can step forward together with the
third rotor regardless of the position of the rightmost, fast rotor
which usually governs the stepping of the middle rotor.

To illustrate this let us look at a few examples. Let us use Rotor I
in the rightmost position (fast rotor) and Rotor II in the middle
position. We can place any other rotor in the third position. Rotor I
will allow stepping of its lefthand neighbour when Q appears in the
window and likewise for Rotor II when E appears in the window.

It is clear that if we have the following rotor positions:
			A E Q
all of the rotors will step forward on positon on the next key
press as both the notch on the rightmost rotor and the middle
rotor is in the engaged position. The result will be:
			B F R

If on the other hand we started with the situation:
			A D Q
a normal turnover of the middle rotor will take place as the
rightmost rotor has its notch in the engaged position. The
result will be:
			A E R
On the next key press the righthand rotor will step forward one
position as usual and the third rotor (leftmost rotor) will also
step forward one position as the middle rotor has its notch in 
the engaged position, but due to the anomoly the middle rotor
will step as well, even if it stepped forward on position on the
last key press. The end result will be:
			B F S

This is what I meant by the double stepping of the middle rotor.
It is clear that this will shorten the period of the machine as
the middle rotor will step forward twice without a complete 
revolution of the fast, rightmost rotor.

I hope the Enigma stepping mechanism now has become somewhat clearer.

I think a much better source is the following book:

   "The Enigma War", Jozef Garlinski, Scribner's Sons, NY, 1979.

I picked this book up years ago in a discount rack somewhere, and never 
see it mentioned in the literature on the Enigma. But the book lays out 
the operation of the machine quite clearly, and enabled me to write my 
own simulation several years ago. It is written in BASIC (sorry, those 
were the days when there were few choices in PC languages). I will be 
happy to post the program here if anyone is interested. All versions of 
MS-DOS still come with a BASICA  compiler.

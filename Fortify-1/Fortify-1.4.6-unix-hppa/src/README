Commencing from June 1999, the source code for all releases
of Fortify for Netscape is now packaged and distributed separately.
This has been done to minimize each distribution's download size.

You can find the latest source code distributions on the 
Fortify FTP server, at ftp.fortify.net, or any of the mirror
sites listed on http://www.fortify.net/download.html.
The source and binary distributions are packaged with the same
version numbers for each major platform.

If you wish to compile and run Fortify from the source code
on either MS-Windows or MacOS, you will need a copy of both the
source and binary distributions.  The latter contains all the
necessary run-time support and config files.  Unpack both
distributions, compile the source code according to the build
notes provided, and then copy the resulting executable program
into the top level directory of your binary distribution.  Voila!

# This file contains all the user interface strings and messages used by
# Fortify for Netscape at run-time.
# Both the command line and the MS-Windows GUI versions of the program
# share this one file.
# The contents of the file are loaded during program start-up.
# If a message definition is missing from this file (or it is ignored due to
# a syntax error), the program will display a hard-coded (English) error
# message in the output.
#
# The README file in the Fortify for Netscape source code contains some
# notes and guidelines on how to create non-English versions of Fortify
# for Netscape.  Please refer to that file for more details.
#
# Any translation of this file must preserve the underlying semantics of
# the message strings, particularly the Copyright and Terms of Use messages.
#
# The message definition syntax is as follows:
#   - Each message definition is enclosed in a single set of curly braces.
#   - Messages can be re-defined within the file; later definitions override
#     (i.e. replace) earlier definitions.
#   - The first line of the definition contains the message tag.
#   - Second and subsequent lines contain strings of message text, in a form
#     suitable for use with the printf(3C) family of functions.  The strings must
#     be enclosed by "double quotes".  The strings may contain any of the following 
#     escaped characters: '\\' (backslash), '\"' (double-quote), '\n' (newline),
#     '\r' (carriage-return), '\t' (tab), '\NNN' (octal character code, e.g. \377).
#   - Multiple lines of text are concatenated to obtain the full message definition.
#   - Any line that is not a curly brace, message tag, or message string is ignored.

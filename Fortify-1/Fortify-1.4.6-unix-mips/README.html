<a name="comparison">
<h3> Why do I need Fortify? </h3>
<p>
    The answer to this question can easily be illustrated:
<p>
    <center>
    <img src="images/compare.gif" width=796 height=465>
    </center>
<p>
    The export-grade browser - on the left - can only communicate securely with 
    a certain specific set of web servers.  The fortified browser - on the right - can
    communicate securely with any full strength web server anywhere on the Internet.
<p>
    A more detailed explanation of this comparison,
    along with some examples of each type of server,
    can be found on the Fortify web site,
    <a target="_top" href="http://www.fortify.net/compare.html">here</a>.
<p>
<a name="features">
<h3> What features does Fortify provide? </h3>
<p>
    In the Netscape 2.x and 3.x browsers, Fortify provides full strength, 128-bit
    encryption facilities.  These are used when connecting to an encrypting
    web server (with the SSL protocol).  Without Fortify, the export-grade web
    browsers are limited to 40-bit encryption facilities, which are substantially
    weaker, and have been demonstrated to be "crackable".
<p>
    In the Netscape 4.x browsers, Fortify provides these same 128-bit encryption
    features, plus the ability to generate 1024-bit RSA keys internally (these
    are typically used for client certificates), plus the ability to send and
    receive e-mail messages using strong 128-bit encryption (with the S/MIME
    protocol).
<p>
    Further details are provided in the following sections of this document.
<p>
<a name="advs">
<h3> What advantages does it have over alternative solutions? </h3>
<p>
    When comparing Fortify to alternative strong encryption solutions, such as 
    SSL relays, SSL proxies, or Java-based applet solutions, a number of 
    advantages are worth considering:
<ol>
<li>
    <b>It is more secure.</b>
    A Fortified browser performs strong encryption internally.
    When connecting to a full strength web server, you have a true, end-to-end,
    strongly encrypted channel.  With SSL proxies, at least one segment of the
    channel remains weakly encrypted.
<li>
    <b>It is faster.</b>
    When using a Fortified browser, the data in the communications channel
    is not re-encrypted as it travels between the browser and the web server.
    It also has fewer network "hops" to traverse.  And, unlike some alternative
    solutions, no supplementary Java applets are involved.  All these factors
    result in better network performance, and less load on your PC or workstation.
<li> 
    <b>It is simpler.</b>
    A Fortified browser requires no additional certificates for its correct
    operation.  Indeed, no other browser reconfigurations are needed at all.
    It is easy to install.
<li>
    <b>It is intranet friendly.</b>
    A Fortified browser can be readily installed on a LAN file server and
    shared to a group of users.  No further installation effort is required on
    each individual workstation or PC.  In medium or large scale networks, this
    can lead to substantial savings in administrative time and effort.
</ul>
<p>
<a name="already">
<h3> But aren't the 128-bit versions of Communicator available outside the U.S.? </h3>
<p>
    Yes.  In January 2000, the U.S. Government relaxed export regulations over
    certain classes of mass-market encryption products.  In line with these
    changes, Netscape has made the strong-crypto versions of Communicator
    and Navigator available worldwide.  If you download one of these browsers
    from the Netscape servers, then you will not need Fortify for Netscape.
<p>
    The full details and effects of this change are explained further
    <a href="updateJan2000_main.html">here</a>.
<p>
<a name="versions">

<p>
<a name="preview">
<h3> Are the beta and preview editions supported? </h3>
<p>
    Specific beta or preview releases of the Netscape browsers may be
    supported from time to time, but, in general, there is no on-going
    guarantee that these editions are supported.  Being preview releases
    they come in fairly low on the priority list, since they typically
    have short lifetimes, they are of a poorer quality, and they stretch
    resources disproportionately.
<p>
    If you would like to see a particular preview release supported, feel
    free to <a target="_top" href="https://www.fortify.net/contact.html">say so</a>,
    and keep an eye out for future announcements (or subscribe to the Fortify
    mailing list).
<p>
<a name="intl">
<h3> Are the international (non-English) editions supported? </h3>
<p>
    Fortify for Netscape is not explicitly regression tested 
    against any of the international editions of the Netscape browsers.
<p>
    However, the international and English browsers all use the same
    underlying Netscape executable program.  Fortify can be expected,
    therefore, to successfully recognise and upgrade these browsers.
    Indeed, many Fortify users have already reported this to be the case.
<p>
<a name="intl2">
<h3> Is Fortify itself available in non-English translations? </h3>
<p>
    Yes.
<p>
    The Fortify software has been translated into several non-English
    languages.  These efforts are on-going.
<p>
    The translations are provided through the generous, co-operative
    efforts of a large number of project participants and testers,
    under open contribution arrangements.
<p>
<a name="y2k">
<h3> Is Fortify Year 2000 ready? </h3>
<p>
    Yes.
<p>
    Naturally, this statement does not extend to cover the entire functional
    definition of Netscape's browser.
    It only covers the functionality provided by Fortify for Netscape.
<p>
<a name="certs">
<h3> Does it work with a server that uses a Verisign Global Server ID? </h3>
<p>
    Yes.  In fact, a fortified browser will always use 128-bit encryption
    when connecting to <b>any</b> strongly encrypting web server - regardless
    of the server certificate involved.  For encryption purposes, the browser
    draws no distinction between the various server certificates.

    can be found in the 'src' directory, along with a src/README file
    that contains some lab and build notes.
<p>
<a name="else">
<h3> What else do I need to do? </h3>
<p>
    You should flush your Netscape memory and disk caches.
<p>
    This is not strictly necessary, but it will avoid confusion if you are
    in the habit of checking the "Document Information" screen.  This screen
    reports the SSL secret key length that was used when the document was
    fetched from its home web server - which might be earlier than the time
    when Fortify was applied if it is a cached document.
<p>
    You should also check your SSL cipher preferences.  If you normally use
    a non-default set of SSL ciphers, you may wish to review your choices.
    After running Fortify you will have an improved set of ciphers to
    choose from.  The SSL cipher controls are in the Security Preferences
    dialog of the Options menu (v3), or the Security Info window of the
    Communicator menu (v4).
<p>
<a name="do">
<h3> What exactly does Fortify do? </h3>
<p>
    Netscape has possessed the ability to perform SSL encryption ever since
    the version 2.0 release.  The cipher functions have no inherent key length
    limitations.  However, the export grade browser only generates and uses
    40-bit secret keys (padded out with clear text key material where needed).
<p>
    Fortify simply arranges for Netscape to generate and/or use 128-bit secret
    keys whenever possible.  It achieves this by installing itself directly
    in to the browser at a small number of specific places.  In other words,
    it directly imprints your browser.  Thus, no SSL proxy servers or relays
    are involved.  No supplementary libraries or support programs are installed.
    No helper applications are needed.  No special certificates are required
    in either the server or the browser.
<p>
    You start with a vanilla copy of Netscape.  You run Fortify against it.
    You finish with a Netscape executable that is equally as strong as the
    U.S. domestic version.  You then use it in the normal manner.  The next
    time you connect to any full strength SSL server, 128-bit encryption
    will be used, end-to-end, from the server right through to your browser.
    No other re-configurations or adjustments are necessary.  
<p>
    In the Netscape 4.x browsers, Fortify also upgrades security in two additional
    areas - the maximum RSA key size and the S/MIME e-mail ciphers.  The maximum
    RSA generated key size is raised from 512 bits (export-grade) to 1024-bits
    (domestic-grade).  Internally generated RSA keys are typically used for
    client certificates, i.e. for authentication purposes.
<p>
    Strong encryption is provided for your e-mail messages with the presence
    of four strong S/MIME encryption ciphers that are not otherwise available
    in the export browsers.  These ciphers are triple-DES 168-bit, RC2 128-bit,
    RC2 64-bit and DES 56-bit.  With these ciphers in operation, your e-mail
    privacy is substantially enhanced.
<p>
<a name="safety">
<h3> What safeguards does Fortify use?  Can I uninstall it? </h3>
<p>
    Before upgrading your copy of Netscape, Fortify will perform a number of
    preliminary checks.  It checks that a) it has write permission on your
    Netscape program, b) that it can recognize your Netscape program as a known
    version (its file size and MD5 fingerprint are used for this), and c) that
    the installation for that Netscape version can be applied without error.
    If all three tests pass, Fortify then proceeds with the upgrade.
<p>
    Fortify also has a 'nowrite' mode.  This is enabled with a '-n' flag on
    the command line version, or with a checkbox setting in the Options...
    dialog on the GUI version.  In 'nowrite' mode normal processing occurs,
    but nothing is actually installed.  You can use it to safely do a dry run
    of the program.
<p>
    For your added peace of mind, Fortify will offer to retain a backup copy
    of your browser in the same directory.  The backup file is given a '.sav'
    file extension.
<p>
    At any time you may remove the upgrade from your Netscape browser.  You do
    this simply by re-running Fortify against your copy of Netscape.  Fortify
    will detect the upgraded nature of your browser and offer to reverse the
    upgrade.  Reversing the upgrade returns your browser exactly to its
    original form.

<h3> What will Fortify do to a U.S.-Domestic grade (128-bit) browser? </h3>
<p>
    Nothing.  Fortify will only recognise and upgrade export-grade browsers.
    Of course, if you have a U.S.-Domestic browser, then you don't need Fortify,
    since it will give you nothing that you do not already have.
    But there is no risk of accidentally damaging your browser through the
    use of Fortify.
<p>
<a name="recog">
<h3> What does the message <i>"{my browser} is ... not recognisable"</i> mean? </h3>
<p>
    Unfortunately Fortify does not support all releases and all editions
    of the Netscape browsers.
<p>
    The <i>"not recognisable"</i> message can be triggered
    for any one of several possible reasons:
  <ol>
  <li> <b>Your platform or operating system is not supported.</b>
       <br>
       Please check the list of supported operating systems in the
       <a href="#versions">above table</a>.
       <p>
  <li> <b>Your browser is too new for your copy of Fortify for Netscape.</b>
       <br>
       Each time a new Netscape browser is released, a matching release of 
       Fortify for Netscape must be made.  This is inherent in its nature.
       So if you download a shiny new Netscape browser, you will normally find
       that your old copy of Fortify does not recognise it.  You will also
       need to download a shiny new release of Fortify.
       <p>
  <li> <b>Your browser is too old.</b>
       <br>
       Fortify for Netscape only supports browsers commencing from version 3.01
       onwards on Unix and Windows,
       or from version 4.06 on MacOS,
       or from 2.02 on OS/2 (the 2.02 OS/2
       browser is substantially the same as v3.x on Unix and Windows),
       <p>
  <li> <b>Your Netscape browser is produced by a third party vendor.</b>
       <br>
       The editions of Navigator and Communicator produced or rebadged
       by third-party organisations are not, as a rule, supported.
       There are simply too many of them.  Typically these browsers are
       bundled with a machine, or with a larger body of system software.
       Some past examples under this heading have been: SGI, BSDI,
       Calderra, AT&T, and Corel.
       <p>
  <li> <b>You have an unsupported beta or preview release browser.</b>
       <br>
       Please refer to the 
       <a href="#preview">above note</a>.
       <p>
  <li> <b>You have a U.S. domestic (128-bit) browser.</b>
       <br>
       Please refer to the 
       <a href="#domestic">above question</a>.
       <p>
  <li> <b>You have a copy of Communicator-for-France.</b>
       <br>
       Until recently, 
       French national law outlawed the possession and use of strong cryptography.
       For this reason, the Communicator-for-France browsers have not historically
       been supported by Fortify.
       With the liberalization of French national crypto laws,
       it is now recommended that French citizens obtain and then fortify
       a copy of the vanilla, export-grade Netscape browser.
       <p>
  <li> <b>You browser has been modified in some way.</b>
       <br>
       Applying third-party patches or modifications to your browser can
       sometimes render your browser unrecognisable to Fortify.
       To avoid this problem, simply fortify your browser before making any
       modifications or patches.  Note, however, that you will not be able
       to de-fortify your browser later, so make sure that you keep a back-up 
       copy of your original browser within arms reach.

<h2>After Installation</h2>
<a name="check">
<h3> How do I check the encryption strength of my copy of Netscape? </h3>
<p>
    You have a few alternatives.
<p>
  <ol>
  <li>  The simplest method is to restart Netscape, or call up the "About..."
        page from the Help menu.  On this page you will see a section
        describing the program's cryptographic features.
    <p>
        The Unix export versions of Netscape describe themselves as
    <br>
    <b>
        "This version supports International security ........."
    </b>
    <p>
        <a href="images/about.gif">Fortified</a> versions
	(and presumably U.S. domestic versions)
        describe themselves as
    <br>
    <b>
        "This version supports U.S. security ..........."
    </b>
    <p>
  <li>  Under Windows 95/98/NT and Unix,
	the most direct evidence of your browser's cryptographic capabilities
        is in the SSL and S/MIME cipher preferences dialog boxes, in the
	security manager.
    <p>
        Export versions of Navigator (v3) offer 40-bit RC2 and RC4 ciphers
	(<a href="images/prefs3e.gif">example</a>),
        whereas the Fortified version offers 128-bit RC4
	(<a href="images/prefs3f.gif">example</a>).
    <p>
	Export versions of Communicator (v4) offer 40-bit RC4 for web connections,
	or 128-bit RC4 and 168-bit triple-DES when a "blessed" web server is involved
	(<a href="images/prefs4e.gif">example</a>).
        Fortified versions, however, offer 128-bit RC4 and 168-bit triple-DES
        without restriction
	(<a href="images/prefs4f.gif">example</a>).
	For sending and receiving e-mail, Communicator (v4) offers 40-bit RC2 only
	(<a href="images/smime4e.gif">example</a>),
	whereas Fortified versions carry an additional four strong e-mail ciphers
	(<a href="images/smime4f.gif">example</a>).
    <p>
  <li>  Alternatively, you can connect to any public full strength web server,
        for example
	<a target="_top" href="https://www.fortify.net/">https://www.fortify.net/</a>
	or
	<a target="_top" href="https://www.c2.net/">https://www.c2.net/</a>,
	and download a page.  You can see the
        encryption strength of the connection in two places:-
    <p>
        a) In Navigator v3, the small key icon in the bottom left hand corner
           of the browser indicates the encryption status.
	<dl>
	   <dd><img src="images/noteeth.gif">
	   A broken key symbol indicates no encryption
	   <dd><img src="images/onetooth.gif"> 
	   A solid key with a single tooth signifies an export grade cipher (40-bits)
	   <dd><img src="images/twoteeth.gif">
	   A solid key with two teeth signifies a full strength cipher is in operation.
	</dl>
    <p>
        b) The "Document Information" screen reports the cipher and key length
           that was used when the document was fetched.  Strong ciphers are
           described as <b>"a high-grade encryption key ...."</b>,
	   while weak ciphers
           are described as <b>"a medium-grade encryption key ...."</b>.
    <p>
  <li>  If you are the skeptical type, find yourself a trustworthy web server
        that tells you about the strength of each incoming SSL connection -
	such as this one:
	<a target="_top" href="https://www.fortify.net/sslcheck.html">https://www.fortify.net/sslcheck.html</a>
        It you want independent verification, try searching through the
	Netcraft SSL Servers Survey at
        <a target="_top" href="http://www.netcraft.co.uk/ssl/">
        http://www.netcraft.co.uk/ssl/
	</a>
    <p>
        Alternatively, find an Apache-SSL web server that has the "printenv"
        cgi-bin script installed ("printenv" prints all the environment
        variables passed to itself; it is included in the vanilla Apache
        distribution).  Open an SSL connection to this script, e.g.
        https://some.server.name/cgi-bin/printenv.
    <p>
        Export versions of Netscape will see a HTML page returned by printenv
        that includes these lines:-
    <p>
      <pre>
        HTTP_USER_AGENT = Mozilla/3.01 (X11; I; ...platform...)
        HTTPS = on
        HTTPS_CIPHER = EXP-RC4-MD5
        HTTPS_KEYSIZE = 128
        HTTPS_SECRETKEYSIZE = 40
      </pre>
    <p>
        Fortified versions (and presumably U.S. domestic versions) will see a
        HTML page returned that includes these lines:-
    <p>
      <pre>
        HTTP_USER_AGENT = Mozilla/3.01 (X11; U; ...platform...)
        HTTPS = on
        HTTPS_CIPHER = RC4-MD5
        HTTPS_KEYSIZE = 128
        HTTPS_SECRETKEYSIZE = 128
      </pre>
    <p>
  <li>  If you are the mis-trusting type, find yourself (or build) a
        trustworthy web server that only accepts U.S. domestic strength SSL
        connections.  Export version of Netscape will fail to connect to such
        a server, but Fortify'd Netscape will succeed.
    <p>
        You can also perform the reverse test, i.e. using only high grade
        ciphers connect to a server that only accepts export strength SSL
        connections.  Amazingly, the server at Verisign
	<a target="_top" href="http://www.verisign.com/">
	(www.verisign.com)
	</a>
        is an example in this category!!
    <p>
  <li>  If you are the deeply suspicious type, you are going to need some
        tools of your own.  You can either 
    <p>
        a) build a test bed server that dumps out SSL conversations
           (ApacheSSL + SSLeay makes a fine starting point for this),
    <p>
        b) snoop the https packets that pass between the browser and
           web server across a network link.
  </ol>
<p>
<a name="email">
<h3> How do I encrypt and/or sign my email messages? </h3>
<p>
    To send encrypted email messages to someone using the Netscape mail program,
    you must have a copy of their personal certificate already stored in your
    Netscape certificate database.  You can obtain their certificate either by
    searching a Network Directory service, or by having them send you a signed
    email message.
<p>
    To sign your own email messages, or to allow others to send you encrypted
    messages, you need to obtain your own personal certificate.
<p>
    Personal certificates are available from most Certificate Authorities around
    the world.  <a target="_top" href="http://www.thawte.com/">Thawte Inc</a>. and
    <a target="_top" href="http://www.globalsign.net/">GlobalSign</a>
    both offer personal certificate products, in a variety of trust levels and
    prices, including a no-cost option.  When applying for a personal certificate,
    always ensure that the certificate key size is at least 1024-bits.
<p>
    Note that if you had a personal certificate prior to upgrading your browser
    with Fortify, this certificate will almost certainly be based upon a weak,
    512-bit key pair.  You should immediately revoke this certificate, and obtain
    a new 1024-bit certificate using your fortified browser.
<p>
<a name="smartupdate">
<h3> I have been using Fortify.  How do I upgrade to a later version of Communicator ? </h3>
<p>
    You can do this in one of two ways.  The simplest and safest method is to
    download a complete export-grade distribution of the new Communicator browser,
    and then install and fortify that browser.  This approach has an added advantage -
    you can easily revert to your old browser should the new one not work.
<p>
    Alternatively, you can de-fortify your current browser (by rerunning Fortify),
    then use the Netscape Smart Update facility to upgrade your browser, and
    then fortify your upgraded browser.
<p>
    In both alternatives you will need to obtain the latest version of Fortify for Netscape.

<h3> What's all this about RSA/RC4/40-bits/512-bits/symmetric keys?  I'm confused. </h3>
<p>
    To cut a long story short, there are two types of keys used by Netscape.
    One is a "secret key", which encrypts and decrypts your transmitted
    data.  The secret key is generally between 40 and 168 bits in size,
    depending on the cipher involved.
<p>
    The second key type - the RSA key - actually manifests itself as two
    keys, a public and a private key pair.  These are used when a new SSL
    connection is established to securely exchange secret keys.  Public
    and private keys are generally at least 512 bits in size.
<p>
    All this is a gross simplification of SSL key theory.  If you want to know
    more, you should refer to one of the many fine SSL reference documents
    available on the Web.
<p>
<a name="strong">
<h3> How strong is a 40 bit secret key anyway? </h3>
<p>
    It is feeble.
<p>
    Netscape Communications peg the computation effort to exhaustively
    search a 40 bit key at approximately 64 MIPS-years (MIPS = millions
    of instructions per second).  This means that it would take a 1 MIPS
    computer 64 years to find a 40 bit key value.  A 64 MIPS computer
    would take one year to do the same task.  Two such computers would
    need 6 months of computation.  And so on.
<p>
    Digital Equipment Corporation announced in July 1996 a version of
    its 64-bit Alpha 21164 RISC chip that is capable of 2000 MIPS.
    Hook together, say, four CPUs of this power, and you have a machine
    that can exhaustively search a 40-bit key space in
    (64 * 365) / (2000 * 4) = 2.92 days.  On average, a key search will
    reach its goal in half the maximum search time, i.e. 1.46 days.
    This is a crude example.  The inescapable conclusion is that large
    corporations, governments, and intelligence agencies already have
    the ability to break 40-bit keys in real-time.  The encryption is
    transparent - like using glass windows against a peeping tom.
<p>
    Similar deficiencies can be seen in the 56-bit DES algorithm.
    DES is roughly twenty years old.  At the time it was designed and
    published it was regarded as being sufficiently strong, given the
    computing power that was available in the 1970s.  Since then the
    algorithm has remained unchanged, and our technology has made
    quantum leaps several times over.  You can draw your own conclusions...
<p>
    In a recent article "Minimal Key Lengths for Symmetric Ciphers
    to Provide Adequate Commercial Security", several of the world's
    leading cryptographers "strongly recommend a minimum key-length
    of 90 bits for symmetric cryptosystems (unquote)".
    [Ref:
      <a target="_top" href="http://www.fortify.net/related.html">
      here
      </a>
    ].
    90-bit keys would appear to be acceptably strong in 1997.
    128-bit keys are therefore what the world should be using.
<p>
<a name="broken">
<h3> Has anyone ever "broken" one of these keys? </h3>
<p>
    Yes. Several times. One of the first public attacks on a 40-bit
    key was carried out in August 1995, as part of Hal's Challenge.
    The challenge was ultimately solved independently by two parties.
    The <a target="_top" href="http://dcs.ex.ac.uk/~aba/ssl/">first</a> party to find
    the key was David Byers and Eric Young,
    using approx 50 PCs, 15 workstations and a MasPar MP-1 for the search.
    The <a target="_top" href="http://pauillac.inria.fr/~doligez/ssl/">second</a>
    person to find the key was Damien Doliegez (France), who
    used approx 20 workstations and two supercomputers for 8 days to
    conduct the search.
<p>
    A group known as the Cypherpunks have banded together to co-operatively
    conduct exhaustive key searches in record times using run-of-the-mill
    computing resources.  Their fastest time for a 40-bit key search
    currently stands at 31 hours 47 minutes, which was the time taken
    to break <a target="_top" href="http://brute.cl.cam.ac.uk/brute/hal2.html">
    Hal's Second Challenge</a>, also in Aug 1995.
<p>
    In January and February of 1997, two more cryptography challenges
    were broken.  The first was a 40-bit cipher key that was broken in a
    mere 3.5 hours by Mr. Ian Goldberg at the University of California,
    Berkeley, using a network of approx 250 PCs and workstations. The
    second was a 48-bit cipher key that was broken in approx 13 days by
    a collaborative group of approx 5000 computers operating across the
    Internet.
<p>
    56-bit DES has also been "broken", on at least four separate occasions.
    The <a target="_top" href="http://www.frii.com/~rcv/deschall.htm">Deschall group</a>,
    headed by Mr. Rocke Verser, announced the winning key to the RSA's first
    <a target="_top" href="http://www.rsa.com/des/">DES challenge</a> in June 1997.
    Deschall was, once again, an Internet-based
    collaborative effort.  The group used the spare CPU cycles from "tens
    of thousands" of standard computers, over a period of roughly four months,
    to perform the key search.
<p>
    The second DES challenge was
    <a target="_top" href="http://www.rsa.com/pressbox/html/980226.html">completed</a>
    in February 1998, by a collaborative group known as distributed.net
    in 39 days - one third of the time taken to solve the first DES challenge.
<p>
    The Electronic Frontier Foundation has accomplished at least two separate
    56-bit DES "cracks" in June and July, 1998.  The most widely publicized
    <a target="_top" href="http://www.eff.org/descracker/">result</a>
    was a solution to the RSA
    <a target="_top" href="http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/des2/">DES II challenge</a>.
    The solution was achieved in 56 hours - substantially faster
    than the previous record.
    These results once again demonstrate the fact that export grade ciphers,
    including DES, are largely ineffective, and their usefulness degrades
    rapidly over time.
<p>
    These and other challenges were published by RSA Inc. on Jan 28th, 1997 as
    part of a research exercise into the security of export grade ciphers.
    The exercise is <a target="_top" href="http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/97challenge/">on-going</a>

<h3> Why should I bother with Fortify?  Who cares! </h3>
<p>
    Let's keep the politics to a minimum, ok?  Suffice it to say that
    privacy is a right, and that the U.S. government's cryptographic export
    restrictions are helping no-one (with the possible exception of itself).
    If you use a web browser for anything that is even slightly personal,
    valuable or sensitive - and sooner or later you will - then you need
    strong encryption.
<p>
    Strong encryption exists right now.  It is proven, it is practical,
    it is reliable and it is cheap.  It is by far the best possible solution
    to a worldwide need.  Anything less is a sham.
<p>
    Say "No" to key escrow.
    <br>
    Say "No" to Clipper chips.
    <br>
    Say "No" to key recovery systems.
    <br>
    Say "No" to diluted key lengths.
    <br>
    Say "No" to cryptography that comes with "strings attached".

<a name="legal">
<h3> Is this legal? </h3>
<p>
    Fortify for Netscape was developed in Australia, using all Australian
    resources, with no assistance from Netscape Communications.  As such,
    it is beyond the ambit of the U.S. Government's export controls.
<p>
    Australian export regulations do not currently restrict export of
    cryptographic software by electronic means, such as FTP or e-mail.
<p>
    You may have the misfortune of being subject to laws in your home country 
    that restrict or prohibit the possession of strong cryptography.  In such
    situations you may find that you cannot legally use Fortify for Netscape
    together with a Netscape browser.
<p>
    Fortify for Netscape is not a Netscape product.  Furthermore, the U.S.
    export laws prevent Netscape U.S. from providing any official endorsement
    or support for Fortify.
    You must weigh up this fact against the acceptability of export-grade
    cryptography.  Support and assistance relating to Fortify for Netscape
    is available via the the feedback form on the Fortify web site.
<p>
    Of course these are not legally authoritative statements.  If necessary,
    you should obtain proper legal guidance from experts in your home country.

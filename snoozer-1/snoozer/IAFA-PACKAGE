Title:          Snoozer - security program
Version:        1.0
Description:    It's a modular security program that dynamically 
                forks a new job to carry out each specific checking 
                action. 
                The four jobs types can check permission modes, 
                owner/groupship, compare the newest last changed 
                time with an oldest one, and compare the just 
                computed file checksum with an oldest one present 
                (optionally) in a memory database. Available
                checksums are MD5, MD4 and CRC32.

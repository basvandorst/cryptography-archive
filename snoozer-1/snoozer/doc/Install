           - (c) 12/1995 by Gino Corradin - Gino.Corradin@dei.unipd.it

- Edit these file :
    > ./config/config.h
         . JOBTAB to change the default name ot the jobtab file for the 
           1st istance of snoozer program (otional).
         . ELOG to change the default name of the errorlog file for the
           1st istance of snoozer program (otional).
         . SLEEP for default sleep time (overwitten by sleep parameter
           in jobtab file) (optional).
         Note that to start multiple snoozer sessions it's necessary
         to set "by hand" via parameter line the jobtab filename,
         automatically errorlog and pid filenames will be set 
         respectively to jobtab_filename.errlog and jobtable_filename.pid.
    > ./config/selfcheck.h
         . AUTO if you want enable the auto-checking feature.
                Set the OSS and NSS C variables too.
    > ./config/mail.h
         . MAILER to define the mail system daemon.
         . SENDTO to define the detination user.
         Remember to define the SEND_MAIL variable in the Makefile to 
         enable the log via mail. 
    > ./Makefile 
         . SNOOZERHOME : you must put here the executable binary.
           All binaries will be moved here to start checking.
         . IFLAGS determines the logging level to stdout.
           Use this variable only during debug phases, for normal use
           comment it out or define it equal to 0 value.
         . SEND_MAIL : define this to enable additional logging via mail.
         . CC if you don't have the gcc compiler.
- do a simple "make". Do a "make install" to install everything and
  start checking. 
- edit ./jobtab file and define various jobs. Specify the correct 
  place for each individual job configuration file.
- edit various job configuration files. 
    > read ./doc/Manual for detailed informations about individual
      configuration file sintax.
- start snoozer by hand : "/absolute_path/snoozer".
    > ./quit script kills snoozer in a clean way.
    > ./reconfig script forces snoozer and each son to reread its 
      configuration file.
- check jobtab.errlog for eventual errors.
- if the SEND_MAIL was defined then check with regularity the SENDTO's
  incoming mailbox to monitor snoozer work.

Good work.

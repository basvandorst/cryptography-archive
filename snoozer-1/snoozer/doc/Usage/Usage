   SNOOZER - ver 1.0
           - (c) 12/1995 by Gino Corradin - Gino.Corradin@dei.unipd.it

  This directory contains a complete (ready-to-run) set of configuration 
files for the snoozer program. Use these files for a tipical network 
server. I suggest to install snoozer in /usr/local/lib/security/snoozer.
  Root is the root's crontab, jobtabs/jobtab* are the starting files 
needed by each job, and input/cfg* are individual configuration files.
  Move all files contained in jobtabs and input subdirs in the snoozer 
base directory, f.e. /usr/local/lib/security/snoozer, insert "root" file
in root's crontab file, and finally move the jobtab_sign_light file
in the base directory with name jobtab. 
  Every night a total check will be made, in addition a fast signature
check will be made various times during the day. This last job checks
only nevralgic files, like suid, inet daemons, and system configuration
files.

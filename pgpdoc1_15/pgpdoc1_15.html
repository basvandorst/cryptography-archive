<H3>Adding a key to your key ring</H3>
<P>Sometimes you will want to add to your keyring a key provided to you
by someone else, in the form of a keyfile.
<P>To add a public or secret key file's contents to your public or
secret key ring (note that [brackets] denote an optional field):
<PRE>
    pgp -ka keyfile [keyring]
</PRE>
The keyfile extension defaults to <VAR>.pgp</VAR>.  The optional keyring
file name defaults to <VAR>pubring.pgp</VAR> or <VAR>secring.pgp</VAR>,
depending on whether the keyfile contains a public or a secret key.
You may specify a different key ring file name, with the extension
defaulting to <VAR>.pgp</VAR>.
<P>If the key is already on your key ring, PGP will not add it again. 
All of the keys in the keyfile are added to the keyring, except for
duplicates.
<P>Later in the manual, we will explain the concept of certifying keys
with signatures.  If the key being added has attached signatures
certifying it, the signatures are added with the key.  If the key is
already on your key ring, PGP just merges in any new certifying
signatures for that key that you don't already have on your key ring.
<P>PGP was originally designed for handling small personal keyrings.  If
you want to handle really big keyrings, see the section on
<A HREF="../pgpdoc2/handle-large-pubrings.html">"Handling Large Public
  Keyrings"</A> in the Special
Topics volume.

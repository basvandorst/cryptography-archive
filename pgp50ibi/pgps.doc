NAME
  pgps - Signs messages

SYNOPSIS
  pgps [-u <userid>] [-abftv] [-z|-zs]
  [-o <outfile>]
  file ...

DESCRIPTION
  pgps signs files using public key cryptography.

OPTIONS
  All configuration options can be controlled from the command line.  See
  pgp.cfg(5) for a complete list and how to specify them.

  -a, --armor
       Turn on "ASCII Armoring."  This outputs a text-only version of your
       encrypted text.  This makes the result safe for mailing, but about 30%
       larger.  Unlike previous versions of PGP, this also implicitly turns
       on clearsigning (wrapping the signature around your message, leaving
       your message in a readable form).

  -b   Detached signature.  Creates a detached signature file (by default,
       file.sig) instead of combining the signature with the message in the
       same file.

  -f   Stream mode.  Accepts input on stdin and places output on stdout.  If
       no files are specified as arguments, pgp executes in this mode by
       default.

  -o outfile
       Specifies that output should go to outfile.  If not specified, output
       goes to the default filename.  The default filename for each input
       file is the input filename with ".pgp" appended, unless ASCII Armoring
       is turned on, in which case it is ".asc".  If -b (detached signature)
       is specified, the output name for the signature is the input file with
       ".sig" appended.  It is an error to specify multiple input files with
       this option.

  -t   Turns on text mode.  This causes PGP to convert your input message to
       a platform-independent form.  It is primarily for use when moving
       files from one operating system to another.

  -u   Sets the ID of the key used for signing.  This may be a user ID (like
       foo@bar.baz.com) or a Key ID (like 0x12345678).  If not specified,
       your default signing key is used.  See also the MyName directive in
       pgp.cfg(5).

  -z   Batch mode.  See pgp-integration(7) for a discussion of integrating
       pgp support into your application.

EXAMPLE
  pgps -u foo@bar.baz.com -bat document.txt
       Creates a detached, ASCII Armored signature for the the file Signs and
       encrypts the file document.txt with foo@bar.baz.com's key.  The resul-
       tant file will be document.txt.sig.

FILES
  ~/.pgp/pgp.cfg
       User-specific configuration file.  The file formerly known as
       config.txt.  See pgp.cfg(5) for further details.

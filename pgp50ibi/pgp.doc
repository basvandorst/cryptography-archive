NAME
  PGP - A suite of tools for encrypting, decrypting and verifying messages.

DESCRIPTION
  There are two files in this package, but several additional modes of opera-
  tion are available via symbolic links:

       pgp(1) is the main cryptographic engine of the PGP package.  However,
       invoking it as itself merely prints a usage summary.

       pgpe(1) is executed to encrypt, or encrypt and sign, files.  It is a
       link to pgp(1).

       pgps(1) is executed to only sign files.  It is a link to pgp(1).

       pgpv(1) is executed to only verify or decrypt signed or encrypted
       files.  It is a link to pgp(1).

       pgpk(1) is the key management application, which is used to generate,
       retrieve and send keys, as well as manage trust.

  Public key cryptography must be fully understood by the user to be useful.
  A successful PGP user must be familiar with public key cryptography in gen-
  eral, and some PGP-specific concepts (such as the web of trust).  If you
  feel comfortable with your own level of knowledge on this subject, your
  first step is probably going to be to invoke pgpk(1) to generate a key.
  Additionally, a page by Phil Zimmermann on the importance of cryptography
  is included in pgp-intro(7).

FILES
  ~/.pgp/pgp.cfg
       User-specific configuration file.  In previous releases, this file was
       called config.txt.  See pgp.cfg(5) for further details.

MIGRATION
  Users migrating from earlier versions of PGP will need to manually migrate
  the following configuration files:

       ~/.pgp/config.txt is now ~/.pgp/pgp.cfg.  This file may be copied
       manually.  If not copied, internal defaults will be used.  This file
       is largely unchanged in 5.0.  See pgp.cfg(5) for more information on
       this file.

       ~/.pgp/pubring.pgp is now ~/.pgp/pubring.pkr.  You may copy your old
       public keyring, or allow 5.0 to generate a new keyring for you.

       ~/.pgp/secring.pgp is now ~/.pgp/secring.skr.  You may copy your old
       private keyring.  Even if you do this, you are encouraged to generate
       a new DSS/Diffie-Hellman key to allow communication with all 5.0
       users.

       ~/.pgp/language.txt is now ~/.pgp/language50.txt.  This file should
       not be copied from your previous installation, as it is completely
       different in 5.0.  If this file is not present, internal defaults will
       be used.

BUGS
  Keyserver support should be more informative with unknown protocols.

  URL parsing uses static buffers and is vulnerable to overflow attacks.

  The PAGER directive in pgp.cfg doesn't work.

  The -b option to pgpv(1) is not implemented.  This option allowed the
  "breaking" of signed files into a signature and a file (effectively, a
  retroactive detached signature).

  pgpv -m ("more" mode) and "eyes-only" decryption is not displaying prop-
  erly.  It is suggested that your pipe the output of pgpv(1) into your pager
  of preference until this is fixed.

  pgpk(1) doesn't pay attention to the +force option to force file overwrite;
  it stops to ask for confirmation.

  Multipart armoring doesn't handle all possible permutations - specifically,
  it does not work properly if all the sections are in one file, or only the
  first file is named on the command line.

  There is currently no way to specify just a secret or public keyring for an
  operation.

  pgp --version doesn't work.  Use pgpk --version or one of the other com-
  mands, instead.

  pgpv -p, to "preserve" the original input filename, is not yet supported.

  There are a number of bugs when specifying filenames ending in digits; the
  general result is that the default output filename is not what might be
  expected (i.e., pgpe -sa foo1 results in an output suggestion of foo1.asc.1
  instead of foo1.asc, as expected).  It is conjectured that the user inter-
  face is becoming confused and invoking the rules used to generate multi-
  part ASCII armor filenames.

  Configuration option TZfix doesn't allow specifying non-mainstream values,
  such as -420 or 30.

  pgpk -e does not ask about marking a new userid as primary.

  pgpk -a should accept a key on stdin, but does not.

  pgpk is, in some instances, overwriting the "previously encrypted to
  invalid key" flag on some keys.

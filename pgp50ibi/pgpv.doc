NAME
  pgpv - Decrypts and Verifies messages.

SYNOPSIS
  pgpv [-fmqv] [-z|-zs] [-o <outfile>] file ...

DESCRIPTION
  pgpv Decrypts and verifies files encrypted and/or signed by PGP.

OPTIONS
  All configuration options can be controlled from the command line.  See
  pgp.cfg(5) for a complete list and how to specify them.

  -f   Stream mode.  Accepts input on stdin and places output on stdout.  If
       no files are specified as arguments, pgp executes in this mode by
       default.

  -o outfile
       Specifies that output should go to outfile.  If not specified, output
       goes to the default filename.  The default filename for each input
       file is the input filename with the ".pgp" ".asc" or ".sig" removed.
       It is an error to specify multiple input files with this option.

  -m   More mode.  Displays message output with PGP's internal pager, or the
       Pager specified in your pgp.cfg(5) file.

  -z   Batch mode.  See pgp-integration(7) for a discussion of integrating
       pgp support into your application.

EXAMPLE
  pgpv document.txt.asc
       Decrypts and/or verifies the file document.txt.asc.  The resultant
       file will be document.txt.

FILES
  ~/.pgp/pgp.cfg
       User-specific configuration file.  In previous releases, this file was
       called config.txt.  See pgp.cfg(5) for further details.

BUGS

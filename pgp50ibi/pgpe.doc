PGPE(1)                          User Manual                          PGPE(1)

NAME
  pgpe - Encrypts and signs messages

SYNOPSIS
  pgpe -r <recipient> [-s [-u <myid>]] [-o <outfile>] file ...

  pgpe -c [-aftz] [-o outfile] file ...

DESCRIPTION
  pgpe encrypts and signs files using public key cryptography, or encrypts
  files using conventional cryptography.

OPTIONS
  All configuration options can be controlled from the command line.  See
  pgp.cfg(5) for a complete list and how to specify them.

  -a, --armor
       Turn on "ASCII Armoring."  This outputs a text-only version of your
       encrypted text.  This makes the result safe for mailing, but about 30%
       larger.

  -c   Conventional encrypting mode.  This uses IDEA to encrypt your message.
       As IDEA is a symmetric cipher, no public-key related arguments  -s and
       -u) are accepted with this argument.

  -f   Stream mode.  Accepts input on stdin and places output on stdout.  If
       no files are specified as arguments, pgp executes in this mode by
       default.

  -o outfile
       Specifies that output should go to outfile.  If not specified, output
       goes to the default filename.  The default filename for each input
       file is the input filename with ".pgp" appended, unless ASCII Armoring
       is turned on, in which case it is ".asc".  It is an error to specify
       multiple input files with this option.

  -s   Sign the document as well as encrypting it.  If you wish to sign only,
       use pgps(1).  This will use your default signing key, or the ID of the
       key specified with the -u option.

  -t   Turns on text mode.  This causes PGP to convert your input message to
       a platform-independent form.  It is primarily for use when moving
       files from one operating system to another.

  -u   Sets the ID of the key used for signing.  This may be a user ID (such
       as foo@bar.baz.com) or a Key ID (such as 0x12345678).  Specifying this
       switch without specifying -s (sign) does nothing.

  -z   Batch mode.  See pgp-integration(7) for a discussion of integrating
       pgp support into your application.

EXAMPLE
  pgpe -r foo@bar.baz.com -sat document.txt
       Signs and encrypts the file document.txt with ASCII Armoring and text
       mode on to foo@bar.baz.com's key.  The resultant file will be
       document.txt.asc.

FILES
  ~/.pgp/pgp.cfg
       User-specific configuration file.  In previous releases, this file was
       called config.txt.  See pgp.cfg(5) for further details.

BUGS

PGP(5.0)                         User Manual                         PGP(5.0)

NAME
  pgp.cfg - Format of the configuration file used by pgp(1).

DESCRIPTION
  The default location for this file is ~/.pgp.  You may specify another
  location by setting the environment variable PGPPATH.  SH COMMAND-LINE
  SPECIFICATION All PGP applications accept these options as command-line
  arguments, as well.  Command line arguments always override the configura-
  tion file.  Options are specified with a double-dash (--) or plus (+), fol-
  lowed by an equal sign (=) and the value, if appropriate.  For example, to
  specify the public keyring to use on an encryption operation:

  pgpe -r foo@bar.baz.com --pubring=~/fooring.pkr

  To turn on text mode, in an encryption:

  pgpe -r foo@bar.baz.com --textmode

OPTIONS
  The following configuration options are supported, both in the pgp.cfg file
  and on the command line of PGP applications.  Case is not important in
  specifying the variable names, but may be in specifying filenames, depend-
  ing on your operating environment.  Immediately following each option is a
  description of its type:  Boolean is either "1" or "on" or "0" or "off";
  String is a string; and Integer is a number.

  Armor
       Boolean.  Turns ASCII armoring on or off.  The default is off.

  ArmorLines
       Integer.  Specifies the maximum number of lines that may be contained
       in an ASCII armored message.  Messages longer than this number of
       lines will be broken up into multi-part ASCII armored messages.  A
       value of zero indicates an unlimited number of lines.  The default is
       zero.

  AutoServerFetch
       Boolean.  If on, when adding keys with pgpk(1), if a specified key
       file is not found, it is assumed to be the name of a key to retrieve
       from your default key server (see HTTPKeyServerHost and HTTPKeyServer-
       Port, below).  Some intelligence is attempted; even if this is on, if
       it is obvious a file was intended (if the first characters are either
       "/" or "./"), a fetch will not be made.  The default is on.

  Compress
       Boolean.  Specifies whether messages should be compressed prior to
       encryption.  The default is on.

  EncryptToSelf
       Boolean.  If on, automatically encrypts all messages to your default
       key, as well as to the intended recipient.  Intended to allow you to
       read encrypted mail you've sent.  The default is off.

  FastKeyGen
       Boolean.  Utilizes pre-generated prime numbers for certain initial
       operations on DSS/Diffie-Hellman key generation.  This only works for
       "standard" key sizes (1024, 1596 and 2048).  The default is on.  To
       turn this off, use: pgpk +fastkeygen=0 -g

  HTTPKeyServerHost
       String.  The name of a keyserver to use in default lookups (see
       AutoServerFetch, above).  The default is pgpkeys.mit.edu.

  HTTPKeyServerPort
       Integer.  The port to use for connections to the default key server as
       specified in HTTPKeyServerHost, above.  The default is 11371, the
       default port for the Horowitz Key Protocol.

  Language
       String.  The country code of the language you wish to use.  The
       default is "us."

  LanguageFile
       String.  The file from which to load runtime strings.  The default is
       "language50.txt" in your .pgp directory.  If this file does not exist,
       PGP will use internal defaults.

  MyName
       String.  The key ID you wish to be default for signing operations and
       the EncryptToSelf option, above.  There is no default; however, if
       none is specified, the first secret key on your secret keyring will be
       used for most operations.

  NoBatchInvalidKeys
       Boolean.  If True, batch mode will fail if the user attempts to
       encrypt to a key that is invalid or not completely valid.  If false,
       batch mode will use invalid keys.  Note that this option only applies
       to batch mode; normally, PGP will ask the user to confirm prior to
       encrypting to in an invalid key.  The default is on.

  PubRing
       String.  Your public keyring file.  The default is "pubring.pkr" in
       your .pgp directory.

  RandomDevice
       String.  Entropy-generating device.  If present, it will be used in
       favor of asking the user for keyboard input.  The default is
       "/dev/random."

  SecRing
       String.  Your secret keyring file.  The default is "secring.skr" in
       your .pgp directory.

  WarnOnMixRSADiffieHellman
       Boolean.  Warns the user if encrypting to multiple keys, one or more
       of which is RSA and one or more of which is DSS/Diffie-Hellman.  The
       reason for this warning is that most RSA key owners will still be
       using 2.6.3, which will not properly decrypt such messages.  The
       default is on.

  WarnOnRSARecipAndNonRSASigner
       Boolean.  Warns the user if encrypting to an RSA key, but signing with
       a DSS/Diffie-Hellman key.  The reason for this warning is that most
       RSA key owners will still be using 2.6.3, which will not properly
       decrypt such messages.  The default is on.

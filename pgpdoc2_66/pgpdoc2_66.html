<H2>Freeware status and restrictions</H2>
<P>PGP is not shareware, it's freeware.  Published as a community
service.  Giving PGP away for free will encourage far more people to
use it, which will have a greater social impact.  Feel free to
disseminate the complete unmodified PGP release package as widely as
possible, but be careful not to violate U.S. export controls if you
live in the USA.  Give it to all your friends.  If you have access to
any electronic Bulletin Board Systems, please upload the complete PGP
executable object release package to as many BBS's as possible.
<P>You may also disseminate the source code release package.  PGP's
source code is published to assist public scrutiny of PGP to show that
it has no hidden weaknesses or back doors, and to help people to find
bugs and report them.  Recompile it and port it to new target
machines.  Experiment with the code and learn from it.
<P>I place no restraints on your modifying the source code for your own
use.  However, do not distribute a modified version of PGP under the
name "PGP" without first getting permission from me.  Please respect
this restriction.  PGP's reputation for cryptographic integrity
depends on maintaining strict quality control on PGP's cryptographic
algorithms and protocols.  Beyond that, ad hoc "improvements" to PGP
can affect interoperability, which creates user confusion and
compatability problems that could damage PGP's (and my own)
reputation and undermine the good will earned by the PGP trademark.
<P>This has already started to happen, which is why I'm making a point
of it here.  This creates technical support headaches, and I get
phone calls from confused users who run into problems either because
they have a mutant strain of PGP, or are trying to process a key,
signature, or message that came from an incompatible mutant strain of
PGP.  The source code to PGP was not published to help spawn these
mutant strains.
<P>If you want to distribute a modified version of PGP, or use a modified
version to send messages to other people, you should name the program
in such a way that no one could mistake it for PGP.  The messages,
signatures, and keys it produces must also be labeled in such a way
that no one could mistake them for material produced by PGP.  If you
feel you must modify your copy of PGP, and there is any chance that
the modified version could escape into the environment, please contact
me first to discuss some easy methods for how to prevent people from
confusing your version with the standard PGP.  Perhaps we'll even
decide that your changes are appropriate for incorporating into the
standard PGP release.
<P>Also, you should note that official executable versions of PGP are
always released signed by the PGP developers, so you can verify their
authenticity.  If you find a corrupted copy of PGP, or notice one
being distributed, please contact the people doing the distribution
and suggest that they replace this with an authentic version.
<P>Some older versions of PGP were published under the terms of the
General Public License (GPL), a license designed by the Free Software
Foundation to protect the status of free software.  Newer freeware
versions of PGP are no longer published under the GPL.  The RSAREF
licensing terms are more stringent than those of the GPL.  But even
if a version of PGP is published without RSAREF, in a situation or
place where the RSA patent does not apply, I still do not want the
GPL to apply to PGP, for a variety of reasons, not the least of which
is because the GPL is not optimal for protecting PGP from being
republished with ad-hoc "improvements".
<P>Outside the United States, the RSA patent is not in force, so PGP
users there are free to use implementations of PGP that do not rely
on RSAREF and its restrictions.  Canadians may use PGP without using
RSAREF, and there are legal ways to export PGP to Canada.  In Canada,
where RSAREF is not needed, it is easy to modify and recompile the
current PGP source code to perform the RSA calculations without using
the RSAREF library, just as it was done in PGP 2.3a.  In such a case,
this modified PGP may be re-released under the identical licensing
terms as the current official freeware PGP release, but without the
RSAREF-specific restrictions.  It may not be re-released under the
GPL, as certain older versions were.  And this manual must accompany
it.  That modified version of PGP may not be used in environments
where RSAREF would be needed.

Jim-

I am aware of several European PEM implementations.  Most of them are
part of an EC-sponsored project called PASSWORD.

A quick summary of what I know about these implementations is attached.

Of particular interest, is the UK DRA-PEM implementation, which *is*
available via anonymous FTP.  I have obtained a copy myself.  I'm
not currently aware if the other implementations are available, yet.

I'd appreciate any further information that you or the others may have
about tehse or other PEM implementations.  I'd like to keep my list of
such implementations as up-to-date as possible.

Thanks.

        PASSWORD Consortium.  (PASSWORD is a European Community-sponsored
        VALUE program, comprised of consortia from France, Germany and the
        UK, who are working to establish a pilot security infrastructure
        for network applications for the European rsearch community.  The
        consortium has developed secured applications based on the CCITT
        X.509 Directory Authentication Framework.  These applications
        include an X.509 Toolkit (OSISEC), Secure X.500 (Secured ISODE/QUIPU),
        Secure X.400 (SecXUA), Secure ODA (DOCSEC), and Privacy Enhanced

        directories and includes CA software.  It is built over ISODE/QUIPU and
        uses the OSISEC toolkit.  Written in C, the software is
        UNIX-based.  It was developed under SunOS, but is designed to be
        portable to other UNIX platforms.  Complete source code distributed

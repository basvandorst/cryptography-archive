An early test version of Jeff's mods to RIPEM is now available
on ripem.msu.edu.  The filename is ripem1.3a1.zip, and it is
in directory /pub/crypt/ripem/experimental.

I have not completed merging in the other recent mods made in parallel
with Jeff, and the makefile supports only Unix platforms (& I
have tested only the Sun).  (Since Jeff develops under DOS,
I am surprised he's updated the Unix makefile but not the 
DOS one.  Maybe he's running Linux these days?)

This early version is for those who are anxious to look at
Jeff's new RIPEM API.

Sounds good. Don't forget you can join the ripem-dev mailing list:


You can join the RIPEM developers' mailing list by sending
the message:

  subscribe ripem-dev <Your Name>

(e.g.  subscribe ripem-dev John Smith)

to the address:   listproc@ripem.msu.edu

Subsequently, you can send messages to the list by sending them to:

The reason I didn't include a DOS makefile is that I use a project
file in the Borland integrated development environment in Windows.
Next time I'll try using their "generate makefile" option and send
that along, although I haven't tested how well this option works.

Subject: Comments on 1.3a1 release


Hi Mark. I looked at RIPEM 1.3a1 you put together.  Thanks for
turning it around so quickly.  I have a few logistical comments:

* ripem-encrypt-elm, ripem-encrypt-old clash with ripem-encrypt when
unzipping on MS-DOS.  I know these are only relevant for UNIX, but
maybe something can be done.

The following also reflect changes I made in the release and are
detailed in the changes.txt file:

* Need to remove ripem/main/adduser.* since AddUniqueUserToList was
moved to ripem/cmdline/ripemcmd.c.  

* Need to remove redundant ripem/main/global.h since all makefiles
include /rsaref/source anyway.

* Need to remove ripem/main/list.h and listprot.h. These declarations
are now in ripem.h and no source includes these files.

* Need to remove ripem/main/ripemglo.h since there are no more globals.

* Need to remove ripem/main/ripempro.h since these functions are now
static and declared inside ripemmai.c.  No source files include
ripempro.h.

* Need to removed len_UTC and put_UTC from ripem/main/keyderpr.h
since they are static functions and declared inside keyder.c.

Also, ripem/cmdline/usagemsg.c still says 1.2b, not 1.3a1.  And
ripem/main/version.h says 1.2a, which makes this a good time to ask
what version.h is for?  I haven't ever seen any source files include
it.

That's all for now.

- Jeff

Jeff,
Thanks for the comments.
Yeah, it's pretty sloppy, but I did want to push something out last
night.  I'll make the changes you suggest tonight.
Dunno whether I'll get the other misc. collected changes in...

The file ripem.msu.edu:/pub/crypt/ripem/experimental/ripem-1.3a2.zip
now contains Mark Henderson's sped-up RSAREF 2.0, plus a few
miscellaneous other mods that had been waiting to be merged in.

Still have to build makefiles for DOS, test non-Sun platforms, etc.

<A NAME="Documentation"> &#8; </A>
<H2><A NAME="HDR0"> 1.  Documentation</A></H2>
<P>I've added in a few more things to the documentation mainly in the area of error handling. A couple of typo's have been corrected.

<A NAME="Ported Code"> &#8; </A>
<HR><H2><A NAME="HDR1"> 2.  Ported Code</A></H2>
<P>Some minor changes here to fix a few problems.
<A NAME="telnetd"> &#8; </A>
<H3><A NAME="HDR2"> 2.1  telnetd</A></H3>
<P>In SSLtelnet 0.2:
<P>Changed telnetd to get it's certificates and keys from the same area using the <B>new</B> function <I>X509_get_default_cert_area()</I> that was added specifically for this purpose. You can now change the install location for this stuff in <B>one</B> place <I>rsa/location.h</I>.
<P>Added as well command line options for overriding the "standard" locations
<PRE>
 -z cert=filename
 -z key=filename
</PRE>
<P>Note: I still have not added in the <B>real</B> verification stuff here as it needs better documentation. At the moment you should simply read what Eric has in <I>ssl/README</I> and the code for <I>ssl_client</I> and <I>ssl_server</I>.
<A NAME="Trusted certficates supported"> &#8; </A>
<H4><A NAME="HDR3"> 2.1.1  Trusted certficates supported</A></H4>
<P>In SSLtelnet 0.3:
<P>Thanks to Steven Schoch &lt;schoch@sheba.arc.nasa.gov&gt; we now have a version of telnet and telnetd that can (as long as you enable it with a new server and client option) enable a user to telnet to the telnetd and not be asked for a password if they send a certificate that is signed by a trusted CA (which you naturally configure yourself) for those users in the new /etc/ssl.users file.
<P>I've made some alterations to the patches to allow the server to set a flag to enable/disable this feature and to all comments in the ssl.users file ... all rather minor changes.
<P>You login must support the -f flag ... or you need to use sralogin (which is included) and also need to define USE_SRALOGIN during making of telnetd (set it in the top level makefile).
<PRE>
 telnetd:
 -z certsok
 
 telnet:
 -z cert=filename
 -z key=filename
</PRE>
<A NAME="httpd"> &#8; </A>
<H3><A NAME="HDR4"> 2.2  httpd</A></H3>
<P>Did the same stuff as for <I>telnetd</I>.
<P>SSLhttpd distribution includes the full sources for my current development version based on NCSA httpd 1.3 ... it has support for cgi's mostly working.

<A NAME="ftp"> &#8; </A>
<H3><A NAME="HDR5"> 2.3  ftp</A></H3>
<P>SSLftp now exists ... and was used (unintentionally) to find some bugs in SSLeay [which Eric fixed quickly once found] ...
<P>In SSLftp 0.3:
<P>Fixed a bug in the client that seems to be common with lots of ftp clients based on the SRA stuff or the BSD/Net2 release ... wildcard directory searches broken. (Same bug in the ftp that comes with SOCKS too)

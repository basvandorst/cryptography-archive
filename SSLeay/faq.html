<A NAME="What is this stuff?"> </A>
<H2><A NAME="HDR0"> 1.  What is this stuff?</A></H2>
<P>FAQ last updated <I>05-Feb-96.</I>
<P><I>SSLeay</I> is a free implementation of Netscape's Secure Socket Layer - the software encryption protocol behind the Netsite Secure Server and the Netscape Browser.
<P>This implementation was coded from scratch using only the publically available documentation of the various protocols by <B>Eric Young</B> <A HREF="mailto:eay@mincom.oz.au">eay@mincom.oz.au</A>.
<P>The initial prompting to tackle an <I>SSL</I> implementation, the alpha testing, <I>SSL</I> developer (i.e. Eric) hassling, and documentation was done by <B>Tim Hudson</B> <A HREF="mailto:tjh@mincom.oz.au">tjh@mincom.oz.au</A>.
<P>This implementation has been used by <B>Tim Hudson</B> <A HREF="mailto:tjh@mincom.oz.au">tjh@mincom.oz.au</A> to add <I>SSL</I> support to the following:

<UL>
<P><LI>telnet (server and client) [now called <I>SSLtelnet</I>]
<BR>
<P><LI>ftp (server and client) [now called <I>SSLftp</I>]
<BR>
<P><LI>NCSA Mosaic 2.5
<BR>
<P><LI>NCSA Mosaic 2.6b1
<BR>
<P><LI>NCSA Mosaic 2.6b2
<BR>
<P><LI>NCSA httpd 1.3
<BR></UL>


<P>The following applications are also now available based on the earlier work with input from others:

<UL>
<P><LI>NCSA httpd 1.4.2
<BR></UL>


<P>The follow are available with certain distribution restrictions:

<UL>
<P><LI>Apache
<BR></UL>


<P><I>SSLeay</I> supports the following encryption algorithms:

<UL>
<P><LI>DES
<BR>
<P><LI>RSA
<BR>
<P><LI>RC4
<BR>
<P><LI>IDEA
<BR></UL>

<A NAME="WhatsNew'"> </A>
<HR><H2><A NAME="HDR1"> 2.  What's New</A></H2>

<UL>
<P><LI>Lots of things have changed since the last version of this FAQ was <I>released</I>. The company that we work for now has an official RSA certificate from Verisign - in the process <I>SSLeay</I> has been changed to be able to generate the <I>Certificate Request</I> in a form that <I>Verisign</I> can process.
<BR>
<P><LI>There are now a number of different companies and individuals running secure web servers based on <I>SSLeay</I>.
<BR>
<P><LI>Netscape have released a browser with configurable CA support
<BR>
<P><LI>Verisign have changed their policy on issuing certificates such that certificates will only be issued for use with <B>registered</B> applications (and <I>SSLeay</I> doesn't fit in any of their current categories).
<BR>
<P><LI>Eric's finally got the <I>SSLeay-0.5</I> release together which has involved changes in the <I>API</I> and has also tightened lots of the code. There are also hand-tweaked assembler versions for a number of platforms of the key routines.
<BR>
<P><LI><I>SSLeay</I> now <I>supports</I> Microsoft Windows 3.1 as a series of <I>DLL</I>s (this stuff really is pre-alpha at the moment - but at least the majority of the "interesting" work has been done). Note that this is being updated to the new <I>SSLeay-0.5</I> release at the moment before being generally released again.
<BR>
<P><LI>Eric's left for 11 <B>weeks</B> of long overdue (computer-less) holiday
<BR>
<P><LI>Apache-SSL is now freely available
<BR>
</UL>


<A NAME="Is this legal?"> </A>
<HR><H2><A NAME="HDR2"> 3.  Is this legal?</A></H2>
<P>That is one of the <B>hard</B> questions on which there is as yet no clear answer. You need to read quite a bit of information (see the RAMBLINGS file in the <I>SSLeay</I> source distribution) to draw your own conclusions - and then go and talk to a lawyer. Again this document is my <B>opinion</B> and as such should be treated in that light - reality could be quite different to how I happen to see things :-).
<P>In short:

<UL>
<P><LI>outside the USA there should be no problems
<BR>
<P><LI>inside the USA RSA hold patents over the "RSA" algorithms, however if you use <I>RSAREF</I> (which <I>SSLeay</I> can link to) then non-commercial use is <B>possibly</B> okay.
<BR>
<P><LI>IDEA may be a problem inside Europe and RC4 inside the USA; both can be removed with a simple compile-time option
<BR>
</UL>


<A NAME="What does it cost?"> </A>
<HR><H2><A NAME="HDR3"> 4.  What does it cost?</A></H2>
<P><B>Nothing</B>. The package itself is <B>free</B>. There are a couple of minor conditions which are outlined clearly in the <I>COPYRIGHT</I> file in the source distribution. In short - attribution is mandatory, and no publically available version of this code can have a different license.

<A NAME="Can I use it in a commercial product?"> </A>
<HR><H2><A NAME="HDR4"> 5.  Can I use it in a commercial product?</A></H2>
<P><B>Yes</B>. Free of charge. Read the license carefully (see the <I>COPYRIGHT</I> file in the <I>SSLeay</I> source distribution).

<A NAME="What documentation is there?"> </A>
<HR><H2><A NAME="HDR5"> 6.  What documentation is there?</A></H2>
<P>At present the documentation from a programmer's point of view is fairly light and you really need to work through the same code that is included in the library itself and have a look at how the patches are put together. It is fairly straight forward to add <I>SSL</I> support to an existing application.
<P>Most of the issues that need to be considered if you are going to start using <I>SSL</I> either as an end user or as a developer are covered in the documentation - certainly there needs to be more work done on this documentation; however reading the documentation should answer most questions (and raise quite a few more too).
<P>Eric has finally been hassled into starting documentation on the library itself ... see the <I>doc</I> directory in the <I>SSLeay</I> distribution. This documentation will be turned into a more verbose manual over then next few months.
<P>The <I>best</I> starting point is to look at example code ... either in the sample client and server program included with <I>SSLeay</I> or in any of the patched applications - the structure of each of the applications internally is quite similar.

<A NAME="Where is it?"> </A>
<HR><H2><A NAME="HDR6"> 7.  Where is it?</A></H2>

<A NAME="Will Netscape talk to NCSA httpd with your patches?"> </A>
<HR><H2><A NAME="HDR7"> 8.  Will Netscape talk to NCSA httpd with your patches?</A></H2>
<P>This (believe it or not) has been the most commonly asked question so far.
<P>The whole dependence on RSA (actually now <I>Verisign</I>) for certificates is because Netscape browsers at release 1.x do not allow the user to configure <B>which</B> Certifying Authorities are trusted and <B>only</B> trust four hardcoded CAs.
<P>The Netscape Navigator starting with release 2.x (beta) supports user configurable CAs. If the user connects to service that is using a certificate that is not signed by one of the hardcoded CAs then the user is asked if they want to add it to the list of trusted CAs. This basically means that the security trust policy is now in the hands of the <B>user</B>.
<P>So in summary: for the old version of the Netscape Navigator (v1.x) the answer is rather simple: yes <B>if and only if</B> you have a certificate signed by <I>Verisign</I> or Netscape (which cost $US200-$US300). This has been tested by quite a few people (including myself now) and does indeed work. For the new versions (v2.x) this is no longer a "problem".
<A NAME="Will Verisign issue certificates for use with non-Netscape {{SSL}} servers"> </A>
<H3><A NAME="HDR8"> 8.1  Will Verisign issue certificates for use with non-Netscape SSL servers</A></H3>
<P>This is really an unknown. If you are inside the USA, and you have linked with the <I>RSAglue</I> (and hence are using "RSA Software") and you are not charging for use of the software (hence you don't come under the commercial license requirements as <B>I</B> interpret it) then you <I>should</I> be able to get a certificate from Verisign - as I <I>think</I> that this meets all their license requirements. If you are going to do this then I suggest that you carefully read the license that comes with <B>RSAREF</B>.
<P>Note: like the rest of this document - this is not a <B>legal</B> opinion and is only <B>my</B> view of things.
<P>As soon as I have an <B>official</B> statement from RSA (or <I>Verisign</I>) on their views of this issue, I'll update this section of the document. I am interested in feedback from those who contact RSA (or <I>Verisign</I>) to see what their actual response is to using <I>SSLeay</I>.
<P>Note: <I>Verisign</I> (who are now responsible for generating and managing the signing of certificates on behalf of RSA) have changed their policy such that <I>SSLeay</I>-based applications do not meet their requirements (at the moment) for them to issue certificates.
<A NAME="Can you legally use an existing RSA certificate?"> </A>
<H3><A NAME="HDR9"> 8.2  Can you legally use an existing RSA certificate?</A></H3>

<P>If you already have a certificate from RSA can you (legally) use it with an <I>SSLeay</I>-ized httpd? This <B>may</B> be okay if you have linked with <I>RSAREF</I>. Outside of the USA this isn't an issue as far as I am aware. However if you want the Netscape browser to work in secure mode then you will still need an RSA or Netscape signed certificate for your <B>server</B>.
<P>You really <B>should</B> read the details of the process that <I>Alex Tang</I> <A HREF="mailto:altitude@cic.net">altitude@cic.net</A> has been through if you are <I>"blessed"</I> with being inside the USA. This is detailed at <A HREF="http://petrified.cic.net/~altitude/ssl/ssl.saga.html">http://petrified.cic.net/~altitude/ssl/ssl.saga.html</A> and makes quite "interesting reading".

<A NAME="Will NCSA Mosaic talk to Netsite secure servers with your patches?"> </A>
<HR><H2><A NAME="HDR10"> 9.  Will NCSA Mosaic talk to Netsite secure servers with your patches?</A></H2>
<P>The patches to Mosaic were done so that there is <B>no</B> checking of the certificate of the server such that Mosaic will connect and work with <B>any</B> of the existing Netsite secure servers without a problem. This however is probably <B>not</B> the policy you should run if you are planning on issuing credit card transactions - the client <B>should</B> have some form of security verification procedure in place where it checks the server against a trusted list before handing over any important information.
<P>Exactly how the whole certificate management and authorisation process is going to work on a <B>global</B> basis is really unknown at this stage.

<A NAME="How can I help with this stuff?"> </A>
<HR><H2><A NAME="HDR11"> 10.  How can I help with this stuff?</A></H2>
<P>Rather simply put, we <B>need</B> people who are prepared to contribute to the effort under the same conditions that we work (which is simply attribution is mandatory but everything generated is totally <B>free</B> otherwise) so that we have a wider supported set of applications. If you do add <I>SSL</I> support to an application please drop us a line (and the patches if at all possible).
<P>However if you wish to send donations of almost any form, neither of us will say no and it may influence what we work on next and how quickly things are done.
<P>If you have access to a Unix varient that we do not and you are well connected (bandwidth-wise) and don't mind a little extra load then we can speed up the spread of the <I>SSL</I> applications (the library itself is <B>very</B> portable - it's the applications (at the moment) that are significantly less so.
<P>Also <B>join</B> the <A HREF="mailto:ssl-users@mincom.oz.au">ssl-users@mincom.oz.au</A> mailing list (send email to <A HREF="mailto:ssl-users-request@mincom.oz.au">ssl-users-request@mincom.oz.au</A> for instructions for using the <I>majordomo</I> varient that manages this list - which in short are send mail to <A HREF="mailto:factotum@mincom.oz.au">factotum@mincom.oz.au</A> with a message body of <I>subscribe ssl-users</I>).

<P>Well, as this in an unpaid effort there is <B>no</B> guarantee of support (you get what you pay for :-); however there is a mailing list which has those people subscribed to it who are interested in <I>SSLeay</I> and it's furthur development.
<P>Join the <A HREF="mailto:ssl-users@mincom.oz.au">ssl-users@mincom.oz.au</A> mailing list (send email to <A HREF="mailto:ssl-users-request@mincom.oz.au">ssl-users-request@mincom.oz.au</A> for instructions for using the <I>majordomo</I> varient that manages this list - which in short are send mail to <A HREF="mailto:factotum@mincom.oz.au">factotum@mincom.oz.au</A> with a message body of <I>subscribe ssl-users</I>).

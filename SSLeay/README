README

All the documentation for SSL is done in "SDF" ... see the note at the
end for more information on this.

ssl.ps includes *all* the documentation in a single file 

faq.html        - the SSLeay FAQ
ssl.html        - the SSL API itself
certs.html      - the fun stuff on certificates
mosaic.html     - Mosaic porting notes
httpd.html      - NCSA httpd porting notes
telnet.html     - SRA telnet porting notes
changes.html    - things that have been changing
ramblings.html  - Eric's RAMBLINGS file as is

Note: SDF is a perl-based markup language that can 
       generate hypertext versions of:
       - postscript
       - frame viewer
       - frame MIF
       - HTML
       - windows help

- if you are interested in SDF itself then drop me a line as we are planning
on making it available shortly (if there is enough interest). SDF currently
requires FrameMaker to do the "hard" work - however it drives FrameMaker in
batch mode (via fmbatch) which does not require a Frame license (i.e. we
own a number of Frame licenses internally and when we don't need to tie
up a Frame floating license when doing SDF processing).
- I also use a significantly modified version of fm2html (FrameMaker to HTML
originally from Norwegian Telecom) to drive the HTML generation. It is
available (and I'll soon announce it's location on comp.text.frame)

Please read the COPYRIGHT file for details on the distribution restrictions
for this documentation. If there are any problems or questions about this
then email me and I'll clarify what I mean and why I've said what I've
said.

<A NAME="NCSA HTTPD"> &#8; </A>
<H2><A NAME="HDR0"> 1.  NCSA HTTPD</A></H2>
<P>The aim was to have a replacement for the <I>Netscape commerce server</I> that with the simple addition of a key would be able to server <I>Netscape</I> clients. The patches to <I>NCSA Mosaic</I> were done such that it can talk to this server.
<P>Still to do is the work for a <I>SSL</I> pipe to <I>CGI</I> interface ... at the moment we have not done that block of work (other time pressures) which simply involves an extra process acting as a filter for the <I>SSL</I> encoded I/O.
<P>Note: cgi's are mostly working now ... still have to track down a bug in handling submission of forms, but activation of cgi scripts seems okay.
<P>The <I>httpd</I> stuff was a little messy as the I/O is done in multiple different locations and involved lots of printf's so I cut a printf wrapper (which is in <I>ssl/ssl_trc.c</I> to make life a little easy and the code more maintainable. This wrapper really should be put into <I>httpd</I> and the I/O restructured to go though a single point however that will take more time than is available at the moment.
<A NAME="Makefile"> &#8; </A>
<H3><A NAME="HDR1"> 1.1  Makefile</A></H3>
<P>Usual changes for <I>SSL</I>
<A NAME="httpd.c"> &#8; </A>
<H3><A NAME="HDR2"> 1.2  httpd.c</A></H3>
<P>Command line option addition <I>-z ssl</I>
<PRE>
 -z ssl
 -z debug
 -z verify=INT
 -z cert=filename
 -z key=filename
 -z standalone        # run standalone for a single request
                      # which is very useful for debugging
</PRE>
<P>Note: this means that to run <I>http</I> in a mode that will offer <I>https</I> services you <B>must</B> start <I>httpd</I> with the <I>-z ssl</I> option.
<A NAME="httpd.h"> &#8; </A>
<H3><A NAME="HDR3"> 1.3  httpd.h</A></H3>
<P>Added <I>DEFAULT_SSL_POR</I> of <I>443</I> and defined the global state variables. Also the macro <I>FPRINTF</I> for the <I>SSL</I> version of <I>fprintf</I> was added to make "porting" easier.
<A NAME="http_config.c"> &#8; </A>
<H3><A NAME="HDR4"> 1.4  http_config.c</A></H3>
<P>Set the port to <I>DEFAULT_SSL_PORT</I> rather than <I>DEFAULT_PORT</I> if we are running as a <I>SSL</I> <I>HTTPS</I> server.
<A NAME="http_log.c"> &#8; </A>
<H3><A NAME="HDR5"> 1.5  http_log.c</A></H3>
<P>Catch heaps of fprintf's
<A NAME="http_mime.c"> &#8; </A>
<H3><A NAME="HDR6"> 1.6  http_mime.c</A></H3>
<P>Catch some fprintf's

<A NAME="http_request.c"> &#8; </A>
<H3><A NAME="HDR7"> 1.7  http_request.c</A></H3>
<P>Initial <I>SSL</I> connection negotiation added here ... also had to trap the write sequence in <I>send_fd()</I>.
<A NAME="util.c"> &#8; </A>
<H3><A NAME="HDR8"> 1.8  util.c</A></H3>
<P>Changed <I>getline()</I> to support <I>SSL</I>

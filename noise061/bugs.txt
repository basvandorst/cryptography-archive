Potential bugbears:

        Building the driver with __CPU set to 5 (i586) uses the "rdtsc"
        (Read Timestamp Counter) instruction as an entropy source, which
        may cause a protection fault when run under Windows or OS/2.
        Oddly, this appears to run with no apparent problems when QEMM
        (or allegedly 386MAX) is loaded instead of HIMEM.SYS. 

        [The above is for Pentium (i586) processors; PentiumPro (i686)
        processors may handle "rdtsc" differently.]

        However, there may be other problems with NOISE.SYS when used
        with QEMM.  On a 486DX4 running MS-DOS 5.0 and AMI BIOS (1992)
        there have been many  machine exceptions, though generally tied
        to using an old pager utility.  This problem has not occurred
        on a Pentium running Win95 and Award BIOS using the same pager.

        Since the clock drift sampling uses the BIOS Event Wait timer on
        a continuous basis, there may be conflicts with other programs
        that also use the timer.  (The /c option is disabled by default:
        you will have to rebuild the driver if you want to enable it.)

Reporting bugs:

        Feel free to study the source code and look for bugs or poor
        implementations that I may have missed.

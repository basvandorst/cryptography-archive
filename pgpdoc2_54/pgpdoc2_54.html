<H2>Public key tampering</H2>
<P>A major vulnerability exists if public keys are tampered with.  This
may be the most crucially important vulnerability of a public key
cryptosystem, in part because most novices don't immediately recognize
it.  The importance of this vulnerability, and appropriate hygienic
countermeasures, are detailed in the section xlink"How to Protect
  Public Keys from
  Tampering"../pgpdoc1/how-to-protext-pk-from-tamp.html in the
Essential Topics volume.
<P>To summarize:  When you use someone's public key, make certain it has
not been tampered with.  A new public key from someone else should be
trusted only if you got it directly from its owner, or if it has been
signed by someone you trust.  Make sure no one else can tamper with
your own public key ring.  Maintain physical control of both your
public key ring and your secret key ring, preferably on your own
personal computer rather than on a remote timesharing system.  Keep a
backup copy of both key rings.

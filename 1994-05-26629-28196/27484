This is *TOO* much David.  I appreciate those who counter your
arguments.  I agree with most of what they write, and disagree with most
of what you write.  Frankly I'd like to see much less discussion in both
comp.org.cpsr.talk and comp.org.eff.talk devoted to your writings.  I
suspect many others do to.  However when you claim that not many
disagree with you that is just too much.  Most of those that disagree
with you practice self restraint.  I'd say that if you were to count the
number of people who have posted criticisms of what you have written and
those who have supported what you have written then you would find an
overwhelming majority on the side of criticism.

Michael, who is giving his personal opinion.

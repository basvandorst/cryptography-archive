I made the following recording from a 3-rotor German Enigma.

			 plaintext: michael tighe
 		        ciphertext: djrxyxs qvail

Rotor setting was 01/01/01

left-to-right rotor ordering was 3/2/1.

The middle rotor had a notch on 5, and the right rotor had a notch on 17.

The plugboard was wired as: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
                            EYCFADHGOKJMLNIWQSRUTZPXBV

The Enigma is actually a complicated machine. I didn't really know exactly
how it worked until I had one in hand and could take it apart and see how
it worked mechanically. All of what I had read about it was either
incorrect or incomplete. Even some of the information the Smithsonian
Institute and the NSA states in their museums is incorrect. I can't imagine
how hard it was to break 50+ years ago. What an accomplishment that was.

It was a fun experience writing code that could 'talk' to it. I have been
meaning to getting around to writing a 'bombe' but haven't had the time.
Hopefully this summer.

Good luck,

-Mike

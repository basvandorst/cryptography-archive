As has been pointed out before, current factoring algorithms require
not just a fast processor, but a processor with fast access to several
megabytes of memory.  So massive parallelism is useless unless you can
give each processor enough memory of its own.  This currently costs
about $400 per processor.  You can expect this price to halve every 18
months or so (though if you'd expected it for the last 18 months,
you'd have been disappointed!).  If you're relying on faster
individual processors, you also have to assume faster memory.

The situation would be radically changed by algorithms that didn't
have such memory requirements.

Bamford devotes several pages to "Harvest," the "world's largest
computing system" (Dep Dir Tordella, 1962). This heavily-modified IBM
Stretch was indeed impressive, for its time.

(Heard a great talk by a guy who worked for IBM at the time, on the
Harvest project. The tractor tapedrives were massive. A cost of about
$100 million in today's dollars.)

I confess to not knowing what "position on the matter" is being talked
about here. Rather than make surmisals, and then either refute them or
agree with them, could David elaborate on what he means here about
what the Harvest project implies?

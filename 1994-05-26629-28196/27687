Leaving aside the fact that there are no such internet authorities, both 
systems are effectively offering the ability to trust a key that is 
signed by other parties - which you may then trust yourself.

RIPEM has got various RSADSI certificates of different levels. Any 
enterprising company (eg the people behind SLED) can achieve just the 
same with PGP, *and* you get to choose whether you trust that notarising 
company or not.

(personal observation: Individual persons with nothing to gain are
often more trustworthy than large corporations and governments)

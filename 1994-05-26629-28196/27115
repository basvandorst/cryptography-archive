Do we get to see the algorithm?

Do we get a copy of the executable file, so we can generate test cases?

Do we at least get a few samples of plaintext/ciphertext to compare?

Or do you wish us to perform a known-ciphertext attack on it only?


If you want to have any sort of reasonable security, it should be able to 
withstand at LEAST a chosen-plaintext attack.  And since you are running 
your crypto program on an architecture which provides absolutely NO protection
against reverse-engineering of executables, the algorithm you use will likely
be discovered by a determined cracker VERY quickly.  So, any scheme you
have come up with better not require that the algorithm remain unknown, 
otherwise your algorithm is only useful for keeping one's kid brother out of
one's files.  A determined adversary can break this code in no time.


(RSA, DES, IDEA are all algorithms which are known, yet remain secure.)

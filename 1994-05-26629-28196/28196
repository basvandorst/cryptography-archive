I am, admittedly, new to cryptology. I've read the posts to this group for
about three weeks and read the FAQ (gasp!). That's enough to tell me that
the following encryption scheme would be easy to solve. Bearing in mind that
cryptology is new to me and that, while I have a good understanding of the
C language and moderate math skills, the method of attack escapes me.
 
   1) Get the current system time.
   2) Use the time as a seed value for rand() /* yes, I know about rand()  */
   3) Generate a random number.
   4) Add the random number to the current byte of plaintext. Store the result.
   5) Repeat steps three and four until the entire plaintext file has been
      encrypted. Write the result to disk.
 
Obviously, decryption is the reverse of encryption, as long as one has the
seed value. If, however, one does not have the seed value (which will be
16 bits on my platform), what method would be used to attack the encrypted
text? Brute force seems like an inelegant solution.

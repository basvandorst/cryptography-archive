  Going over my calculations, it turns out they were somewhat off, but not
enough to explain what seemed to be a discrepancy.  The numbers I get now
indicate that, in the range of 2^512 < N < 2^1024:

       Without the o(1) term, the factoring-difficulty equation increases
     by about a factor of 2 for each factor of 2^60 increase in N (which
     translates to x10 difficulty per +60 digits or +200 bits).

       With an o(1)=2.08 term, the factoring-difficulty equation increases
     by about a factor of 2 for each factor of 2^30 increase in N (which
     translates to x10 difficulty per +30 digits or +100 bits).

  What's ppmpqs stand for?  (I think the "pqs" stands for "polynomial
quadratic sieve", but I don't recognize the rest at all).

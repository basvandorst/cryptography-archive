(Talk about who causes polarization when PGP is the subject?)

The part of your post which I was referring to, and which you omitted from 
the quotes, was where you said:

     Longer keys would probably be interpreted as an extension of
     the feature set, which requires advance written permission from RSADSI 
     under the license.

     But if you want the facts, check with them, rather than speculating 
     or going with my opinion.
 
My comment was referring to your normal, and all-too-often inexplicable, 
deferrence to RSA/PKP on matters that are not theirs to control.  Having
issued a license, they, too, are bound by its terms, and it is not for them
to say what the license means in the case of a dispute.  (Which you did
acknowledge above.  Thank you.)

My post was not intended to polarize, but to suggest that, once again, you
were deferring to the wrong source.  Unless the license speaks to the issue, 
whether a key length increase is, or is not, a "performance improvement" is
*not* for RSA/PKP to say.

As you imply, if a dispute arises on the interpretation the parties may 
attempt to discuss it first and work out an understanding; however, neither
party has an enhanced position in that discussion wrt the other party.

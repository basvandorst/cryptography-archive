First,  Marc asserts:

Then Larry describes bit ordering on a little-endian machine,

And to show the corresponding case for a big-endian machine, I'll point
out that the PDP-10 / DECsystem 20 (big-endian machines) number the
bits in the other order - Bit zero is on the left (the sign bit) and
bit 35 is on the right.  (Just like the IBM 7000 series...)

This numbering is returned by the JFFO instruction (Jump if Find First One)
which returns the bit number (0 on the left) of the first one-bit in
a register, and jumps if any one-bit is found.


So I think Marc's statement is wrong.  The PDP-10 clearly has "big endian
bit order" and the 80x86 has little endian bit order.

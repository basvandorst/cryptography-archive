This confusion has arisen before. Until your current reply you had not said
"government licenses" for export. The confusion is between RSADSI licensing
something using their patent or copyright rights, and the Government
licensing something under ITAR.

If the government licenses it for export (more accurately, State determines
that it gets a commodity jurisdiction and hands it over to Commerce), then
of course it can be exported (except to Cuba, Iraq, North Vietnam, and a few
other really "bad guys".

However this would fly in the face of the current set of policies, since
that would mean licensing both RSA and IDEA for export as "strong"
encryption. It would probably take a change in policy for that to happen; I
think such a change unlikely despite the attempts by some.

As for "entrapment" and "chilling" this tone pervades many of your messages
and is usually unwarranted in the context of those messages. In the present
case to jump to such conclusions when the issue turns on an ambiguity in
your use of "license" is hardly warranted. Lighten up.

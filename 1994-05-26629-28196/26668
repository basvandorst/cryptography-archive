   One thing I've been curious about:  How much did you rely on the reliability
   of the people doing the distributed computing and the channels used to send
   their results to you?  Suppose, for example, that a few people trying to
   defeat the project had decided to send you bogus relations.  How many would
   it have taken to have caused you a serious problem?

We did not rely on the reliability of the users.  One of the neat
things about how the factoring process works is that while it takes a
lot of time to generate the data used to factor the number, it takes
virtually no time at all to *verify* the data.

To use the metaphor that Arjen used, its like finding 8.2 million
needles in a giant haystack.  However once we have a "needle", it is
very easy to check and see that it is really a needle as opposed to
another piece of hay!

Does this make it clearer?

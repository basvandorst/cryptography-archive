I think you are mistaken. "Title (S)" or "Title (Secret)" means the title
itself is Secret.

"Title"
(Secret)

Means the document is Secret but not the title. It's usually written as
"Title (U)"
(Secret)
or some such, particularly on a list so as not to confuse Secret titles of
documents which may be Secret or even higher, from Unclassified titles of
Classified documents.

Publishing a Secret title is as much a violation of law as publishing a
Secret document.

It may happen that multiple solutions are all plausible.  For example,
'Attack at dawn.' xored with 'Dig in at dusk.' gives the same answer as
'Attack at dusk.' xored with 'Dig in at dawn.' There are probably
examples constructed without the word-interchange trick. This can
happen because the redundancy of text varies and can fall below 50%
for a little while.

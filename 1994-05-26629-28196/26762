Here you go again, David!  Another "Sternlight Special."  Restated, your 
question becomes:

"Prove that it cannot be done in less than the time I find unconvincing, 
given that I postulate increases in hardware to make your assertion 
impossible."

Why don't you give us the technical specifications of your "massively parallel
extremely fast NSA-special" processor, and let the mathematicians work against
a fixed target, instead of one your continually move after you see where they're
going to hit?

[OBTW:  I agree that the target is moving, since we all realize that computing
technology gets better each year.  But to have a meaningful discussion, that is,
if you're really interested in one, we have to set some bounds on the rate of 
change and then qualify the answer accordingly.

[That is, if you're truly interested in an answer.]

David, this is dishonest.  The only new information in Tate's article is:

All other information is in Silverman's article.  He probably would not
know how much off-the-shelf hardware could be bought for $30 million,
at least I would have had no idea at all.  And Tate probably would not
have known how much harder 512 or 1024 bit RSA would be.  If (as you said
in another article) Silverman would have kept silent because he did not
know all information you requested you would not have received this
information at all.

Moreover, it does not conform to your original spec's.  You required the
information not for off-the-shelf technology but for the much more
advanced technology available to NSA.  Pray tell how this translates
to NSA's technology?

Quoting Mr Junger's post:

and again,
 
ºOf course, RSA might try to revoke the license, on the ground that the

ºdo that would be by litigation, and there one would expect that any
ºambiguities in the license agreement would be construed against its

All of which, presuming one can trust the return address, I interpret as
authoritative refutation of your entire line of argument.
 
 
I do not believe for an instant that you, Mr. Sternlight, are intentionally
insulting anyone's intelligence or integrity.  Nor do I believe you lack it
yourself.
 
But I do believe that something about public, impenetrably secure
communications frightens you quite literally out of your wits.

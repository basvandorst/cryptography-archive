I did. I have since spoken to the researcher who ghost-wrote the 
Economist article, who is working to design a quantum computer. If such a 
machine is possible (and he believes it is) it would be hugely faster 
at factoring than current methods. Certainly fast enough to destroy our 
nice cosy assumptions about how secure PGP will be for the next 30 years.
Will report when i get more details.

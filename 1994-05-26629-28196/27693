YOU may not, but society is built on trust, including trust of
organizations. People trust the Department of Motor Vehicles to issue Photo
IDs good enough to cash checks with; etc. There are severe enough penalties
for malfeasance to add confidence, though nothing is perfect.

PGP may have the capability but it is not in place nor used. RSA's
certification services are both in place, heavily secured, and very widely
used. Claims about PGP's potential are little more than vapor until the
institutional arrangements are in place.

Nope.

Nope.

It would be good if you read the Ripem documentation before pronouncing on
what it can and cannot do. Right now I can encrypt and sign someone else's
key. In future versions the Internet "web of trust" extensions to the PEM
RFC will be implemented to provide such certificates as part of key
management. So the bottom line is that RIGHT NOW PGP has no central key
certification in place and Ripem does; and Ripem doesn't have web-of-trust
automated but PGP does. Since central key certification takes a long time to
set up with lots of safeguards, while the web-of-trust additions to Ripem
are simply a matter of a couple of programmers putting out the next version,
which one do you imagine will have both approaches, fully integrated, first?

As a matter of direct mail communication, web-of-trust is perhaps acceptable
but in its present implementation it is unsatisfactory for signing newsgroup
posts, for reasons stated in earlier messages.

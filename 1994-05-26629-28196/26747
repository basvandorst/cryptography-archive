*Sigh*.  Not at all.  A 384-bit RSA key has a very special form, and
not all possible 384-bit strings (by a long shot!) sre possible keys.

On the other hand, in a good conventional cipher, there is no wasted key
space.  The simplest attack on a good 80-bit cipher is to try all
possible 2^80 keys.  By this definition, public-key cryptography
is very very bad, because there are *vastly* easier attacks than trying
all possible decryption keys.

Public-key cryptography gives you other things, but all known techniques
are very wasteful of key space.

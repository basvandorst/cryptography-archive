So the problem with clipper is that people might be bribed to falsely 
authenticate clipper keys?  I guess *now* I don't know enough about how 
clipper is supposed to work.  

I thought the problem was that no one trusts the official bodies who are 
meant to hold the key escrows, and the cure was to use a system where 
the control of the keys was in the hands of the users.

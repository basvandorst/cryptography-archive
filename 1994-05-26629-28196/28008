  Ahh... If you can solve ANY NP-Complete problem in Polynomial Time you
can solve ALL problems in NP in polynomial time. That is what the
definition of NP-Complete is. You just do a Polynomial Transformation
of the problem you have into the problem you can solve. This is
guaranteed to work if the solvable problem is NP-Complete.
  I'll wait and see and buy a drink for the person who actually builds
a system thats gets this kind of thing working.
  If you are redefining the term NP-Complete for a "QC", then what is
its new meaning?

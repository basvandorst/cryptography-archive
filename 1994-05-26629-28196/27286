	For those of you trying my book cipher challenge, it
	has been pointed that I made a mistake in the arithmetic
	of the recognition groups.  They should be as follows:
	
1st recognition group (3rd group of text):  75918

2nd recognition group (antepenultimate):  66134.

	Another crib: "apothecary."
	
	The text used for the superencrypting running key is
	a coherent English text.  This should therefore be
	breakable according to David Kahn (a heavy hint 
	in there).

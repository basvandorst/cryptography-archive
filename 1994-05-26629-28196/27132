Yes, I believe that natural law exists, is objective, and is becoming 
more evident to humanity with the passage of time.  This is an 
*EXTREMELY* interesting and profound issue, and I believe that it 
can be studied FORMALLY.  But you have to give me a few years, ok people?

Let me just address the notion of natural law in the more intuitive and
abstract setting in which you appeal to it.  This rather blatant violation
of the natural law (in accordance with the spirit of which the Framers
provided the First Amendment) which our intellectually pathetic legislators,
who don't have the moral substance to understand our Constitutional
heritage, are seriously considering, is actually the harbinger of a very 
encouraging phenomenon, because it betrays the first recognition on their
part that government, in the wake of the information age, is *losing
control*.  I'll just pipe my already encrypted code through "Skippie"--
Custom chip fabrication will be getting even cheaper!  And it remains to
be seen whether Skippie will even be upheld in court...  But even in the
absence of encryption devices, extensive communication of anti-governmental
sentiment will be too voluminous to stifle.  Now, all governments, 
even those regarded as the most historically oppressive, have been
forced by natural constraints to accord their subjects some minimal
degree of autonomy.  It would not appear that technological progress,
yes, the actual improvement of human knowledge, so militated against
the efforts of our Congress to govern, if they were according us the
proper degree of autonomy as stipulated by the natural law, now would it?
What sort of activity, currently defined as criminal, could the government
prevent people from participating in by tapping wires?  Drug trafficking.
The natural law will force our legislators, in practice if not in 
principal, to recognize that they cannot regulate victimless crimes.
Note that this does not imply that the natural law condones recreational
drug use--  My opinion is to the contrary, in fact.

By the way, the natural law DOES come from God.  The one God.

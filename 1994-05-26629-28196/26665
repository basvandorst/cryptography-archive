In article <strnlghtCp20Ct.IuJ@netcom.com> strnlght@netcom.com (David Sternlight) writes:

   My point, though, was that the President has authority beyond carrying out
   the will of Congress, as was suggested by another. For example:

   (Article II Section 2) The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army
   and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several states,
   when called into the actual service of the United States.

   In the case being discussed, it was asserted that one should not have to ask
   Congress to intervene. But since the President is within his rights on
   matters of national security as Commander in Chief, the only power Congress
   has is to try to limit him via a back door, such as a denial of funds. This
   takes a positive action by Congress.

How does the president being COC of the Army and Navy (OK, I'll grant
the Air Force, too), and militias, give the executive the power to
control by administrative fiat the workings of the civilian economy?
Since Zimmerman is not a member of the armed forces (to the best of my
knowledge), I don't see how executive orders issued in the president's
capacity of COC can be binding on him.

Article II section 2 does not read like a catchall national security
clause.  It is worded very specifically, and it very clearly applies to
the military, and the military ONLY.  Note that if you're claiming that
since crypto is defined as munitions, it is covered by this section,
you're 1) extending it considerably further than it reads, and 2)
apparently putting anything the executive desires control over under the
control of the executive, since it could always be defined as
military-related.

Eh?  Schneier claims that using low values of e is insecure....  "Hastad
demonstrated a successful attack against RSA with a low encryption key.
... Moral: Choose large values for e and d."  This is in Applied
Cryptography p. 287.  There's a reference to a paper in the CRYPTO '85
proceedings, so this can't be anything recent.  Have I missed something?

Pardon me, I'm lost, can you direct me to the information superhighway?

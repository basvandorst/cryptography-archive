I imply no such thing. I say that in the case we're discussing, when no
consideration is changing hands, and one party has a patent, that party has
an enhanced position.

If someone refused to honor that enhanced position, the patent holder has
two alternatives:

1. To announce that the other party is not licensed. In cases where, for
example, download sites honor patents and don't get into disputes, that
might be all it takes;

2. To proceed against the other party for infringement. In such a case the
tryer of fact has the last word, but note that patents are presumptively
valid when issued, and if no consideration has changed hands for the
license, it is highly unlikely the tryer of fact will side with the party
charged with infringement. Only if the patent can be upset is the putative
infringer likely to come out with a whole skin.

In other words, in the case you mention, where the license language is
ambiguous, and the other circumstances are as stated, the licensing party
has the last word unless the claimed licensee wishes to risk infringement
charges, legal costs, and time. This is particularly so when a licensor feel
obliged to defend its patent position.

One man's opinion, not "the truth".

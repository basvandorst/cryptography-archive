I think this to be wrong. To my personal knowledge until I left defense work
in 1960 to get my Ph.D. in Economics, the government had more advanced
machines than the unclassified private sector did, often by funding secret
projects in the private sector. Can you say "ARPA"? "USAF TOD Program"? You
don't even have to whisper NSA or CIA.

I know of no reason, given the economics of electronic technology, that this
shouldn't still be true.

By the way, there's a big chip fab facility advertised in Sunday's LA Times
for sale by auction. Fairchild, I think. I see no reason such facilities
would be in short supply, nor limited exclusively to the unclassified
private sector. It is, after all, only money, and DOD and the Intelligence
Community, despite cuts, has lots of that.

       Woof!  This is a real bait and switch.  Does this mean that those
   people who paid for PGP 2.4 will be SOL?  And, of course, that all of
   the overseas PGP users either have to get an (illegal) copy of PGP
   2.6, or reverse engineer it if they want to continue talking to
   Americans?

Different issue - 2.6 is incompatible with Real PGP, but it's free.
It's version 2.5 that says I've only gotten 5 months of extra legality
for my $100 :-)  Users of the additional ViaCrypt products like their
CompuServe mail interface might be more bugged, though if I remember right,
it calls their PGP program to do the encryption work, and might
therefore support MIT 2.6 instead.

       If MIT is really trying to do the "right thing," they need to deal
   with these issues up front.  (For example, they can deal with the
   first issue by agreeing to provide PGP 2.6 to all ViaCrypt commercial
   PGP customers through ViaCrypt.)

MIT has no obligation to support ViaCrypt; ViaCrypt made a commercial
decision based on their own market estimates.  If the rest of the
market out-competes you, well, that's capitalism.  Maybe ViaCrypt has some
issues to discuss with PKP, but I assume PKP were'nt 100% happy with
ViaCrypt either.

The good news - All of us can get PGP 2.5 free now, and use it legally,
compatibly with the non-US versions, modulo any serious bugs.
Perhaps it's time for a Version 2.7, which does bug-fixes on 2.5,
or perhaps that should wait until 2.6 is out so we can see how to
interoperate with it also (or at least find the 2.5 bugs more easily.)

The not-so-bright news - if you wanted to be non-PGP-compatible,
vanilla RSAREF 1.1 or 1.0 could let you build a version using most of
PGP's code; the signatures and key encryption would just have an extra
DES layer in the middle to obfuscate things, e.g. instead of 
RSA(IDEASessionKey), you'd have RSA(DESSessionKey), DES(IDEASessionKey).
Aside from the amount of work involved (:-), I decided not to build
one because of the incompatibility.  

Does PKP have any benefits to offer us in return for the loss of compatibility?
When the specs come out, should we try to convince the
international PGP group to upgrade?

If IDEA is a "group" (this is a mathematical term), there is no benefit,
since there will be a single IDEA key that is exactly equivalent to the
doubly encrypted keys.  If IDEA is not a group, then there is something
to be gained by double/triple/whatever encryption.  The creators of IDEA
do not think IDEA is a group (when last I checked), but have not proved
this.  DES, by the way, has been proven to be a group.

No. The PIN is a rather good hash function from vrious bits of account info to a 4
digit number. I think that as far as is known, brute force ( try every 4 digit
number) is by far the easiest way to figure out the PIN of a card ( given only the
card adn an accomodating ATM machine.) However, there are far easier ways to figure
out the PIN- read it off the some little scrap of paper in te wallet,  or read it off
over the person's shoulder as they punch it in are two ways. ( I think ATMs and even
worse the Automatic credit things in supermarkets these days were designed to make
it easy for everyone to see what your PIN is.)

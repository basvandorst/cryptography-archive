This is probably a FAQ, but I'll ask it anyhow:

Are there any published sources (or better) ftp sources of ENIGMA
wheel wiring?  Actual ENIGMA wiring?

I'm specifically looking for the original German 5 wheels
and the "umkerhwaltz" (or whatever that unpronouncable thing
was!). It would also be nice to know what position on the circle
was wired to what letter (if 00-25 were the points of contact, on the
wheels, were these wired to A-Z respectively for example?).

I suppose, nobody has the "Uncle Walter" wiring that appeared for one
[known?] day.

I'm trying to reconstruct an authentic model of an ENIGMA on the PC.

Book references are welcome. I currently have "The Hut 6 Story -
The breaking of the ENIGMA", but this does not cover actual wiring.
Otherwise, good stuff.

Please email if possible, thanks in advance.

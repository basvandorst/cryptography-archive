This looks like an application  of some of the data mining techniques
I investigated in a previous job.  I don't have the paper describing the
technique handy but if memory serves me, there is still quite a bit 
of work left to the interpreter to determine if the relationships uncovered
by the application are truly "meaningful"  Also, the results can be
skewed by input.  

The example in the paper used a document that contained some
information about mushrooms.  The data mining application produced a
chart of relationships between subjects and attempted to deduce which
mushrooms were poisonous.  It was a pretty rough program but did
produce some interesting results.
 
I'll try to dig up the original paper.

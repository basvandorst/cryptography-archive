Perhaps I am only being a "sore loser" by maintaining opposition to Clipper.
However, I feel the issues are too important to not continue the debate. In
essence, I see the primary issue to be how much trust to place in the persons
who are the actual government implementors of Clipper. If you assume they are
uncorruptible then there is little reason to oppose Clipper. For me, this is
far to much to assume. Hence, my continued opposition to Clipper.

You make my case with the above. We cannot know, nor take the trouble to
find out what the key signing policy is of the many who sign the keys of
everyone who posts. But we do know the signing policies of the central
certifying authority.

What's more, I never heard of you and so have no way to know if you're
telling the truth or not. Thus a public post, signed by a key which you
signed, is as far as I am concerned, unauthenticated (nothing personal).

On the other hand, I know in detail what the safeguards of the RSA
Certification authority are, and what's more know that they have their
reputation, their business, and perhaps a lot of money to lose if sued, if
they violate those announced policies. They charge money for signatures and
thus are sueable if they violate the associated trust based on their
published policies. What's more, since they're the same folks who get all
the royalties for the RSA patent, and others, they have a nice pot of money
to collect from if one sues and wins. What can I get from you, even if I
could sue you and had a way to do it transcontinentally? A few thousand DM?
A few hundred thousand?

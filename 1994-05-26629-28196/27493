I wonder if there have been any attempts to track down to origin
of the so called "Voynich Manuscript" by means of analytical
investigastion of paper, inc, etc?
 
Like using methods which are allready well known in distinguishing
between ancient paintings and modern hoax. I think having a chemical
analysis of paper and inc at hand in conjunction with knowledge in
the history of paper and inc production may shedd some light on the
question about the origin of the manuscript.
 
Knowing better where and when the manuscript was written is the
bar fundament of any further attack to the cipher/language of the
document I think.
 
Anyone knows? Any suggestions? Ideas?
 
Thanx

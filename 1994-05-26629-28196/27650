Nope. His message simply provided his public key without any authentication
other than those he got to sign it. Since those are themselves not
authenticated except by the few who trust them, his public key is basically
unauthenticated. What he DID do is prove that the message was authenticated
with that public key. So what?

Ripem provides a certificate in which a known Certification Authority (in
most cases RSADSI--eventually the Internet authorities themselves--vouches
for the sender's public key and one knows what standards have been applied
to prove identity. That public key is used to sign the message. Thus the
person is matched to his key and certified by a high-level-of-trust standard
certifier. That key then is used to authenticate the message.

Putting it another way, I can't get an RSA Certificate without passing a
number of tests of my identity--for the Unaffiliated User Heirarchy that
involves proving to a Notary Public I'm me, with 3 pieces of ID including a
photo ID, and making that assertion under penalty of perjury.

Thus the chances are pretty good I'm me and the key is mine. With PGP one
makes up a key, finds someone or other to sign it, and unless the signers
are both known and trusted by every reader, one has nothing. RSA IS known to
every reader and their safeguards are published.

Until PGP has some trusted official signers with high security certification
device protection and identity safeguards, the level of authentication is
its weakest element.

By the way, in his example he did it wrong. First public key, then signature
or the poor reader has to invoke PGP twice.

No. It was a simple blunder, caused by failing to reread the Constitution
before posting, and also by the behavior of those Presidents. I, too, am
troubled by undeclared wars.

In a message which you must have missed, I corrected my error and
substituted an alternative demonstration that the President has
Constitutional powers other than those granted by legislation (the original
and erroneous assertion by another)--I cited the "Commander-In-Chief" powers
given to him by the Constitution.

As was pointed out to me via e-mail, the Bombe, not Colossus was used
for this.

10^33 WAS the number of possible keys for Enigmas in use at the
end of WWII.  Clearly, Bombe did NOT use exhaustive keysearch.

I haven't read the traditional books on Enigma, just some that report
its relevance to the WWII decisions made by the allies.  But it appears
from them the known plaintext of some messages was one path via which
Bletchley Park attacked the cypher.

As Steve said, cleaverness usually beats brute force.

Learn something every day :)

   As a result, I have already demanded that my key be removed from the
   "server".  If a server's not going to accept my updates, it shouldn't
   carry my key.  I also object to being treated as some kind of criminal
   or second-class citizen.  I hope other legal users of 2.3 will follow suit.


mathew:

You may be too hasty.  For the time being at least, the non-US servers
will continue to accept pre-2.5 keys.

There is no suggestion that the US servers will fail to dole out
pre-2.5 keys.

The implication of the MIT decision is not that you, personally, are a
second-class citizen or a criminal, but that US users of pre-2.5 PGP
are such.  As it is difficult if not impossible to distinguish between
US and the rest of the world's keys, they ditched the lot for safety.

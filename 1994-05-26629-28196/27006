         pal, the number of trapdoor ciphers exceeds 1.  the reason
         it gets used is because it happens to be pretty damn good.

         i am lacking in excitement over this data.  write your own
         RSA implementation, get to know how it works, evaluate it that
         way, let me know how it goes.  take a number theory class.
         you might find that you like RSA more.

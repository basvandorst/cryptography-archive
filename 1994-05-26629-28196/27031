35 and 30 for first and second weeks.  When did you revise the # of
responses that you got in the first week?  I remember you as saying 30 and
30.  If you can't keep those #'s straight, then why am I suppossed to
believe you have the ability to keep other numbers straight?  An increase
of roughly 16.3% (computation done in my head, so can't be sure of %age)
for the first figure is significant to my way of thinking.  If you are
falsifying your numbers, how can we be expected to place any confidence in
what you say?

[ Thanks for trying to make sense of this. My mail address was published here,
[ and it is not secret.

[ But what started this subthread was a message by someone who didn't

[ have seen the request you describe as 2, above, and thus wouldn't have known
[ to mail me. But since it was not I who posted 2 above, and the individual
[ who did is in no one's kill file that I know of, that objection makes no

[ By the way, in response to 1, I got a grand total of 0 (zero) letters. Thus

[ 1, and about 35 the first week and about 30 responses the second week to 2,
[ at the time CPSR was claiming that 20,000 had signed. People are free to

[ at all--that's right no, none, zero in the individuals responsible for this
[ petition. The entire episode seems to me a sorry one of refusal to confront
[ criticism, avoidance, and the most vague kinds of validation. "Other tests"
[ indeed. Especially since CPSR is well aware, one assumes, of the controversy
[ surrounding the petition, Sobel's vagueness in his final press release seems
[ to be more designed to conceal than to reveal.

   David, if you ask a question in a sci. group, you have to know
enough to understand the answer.  Bob Silverman's real answer to you
was that the algorithms and programs that will be used to break
1024-bit RSA don't exist, so it is hard to quantify the hardware to
make the attack.

   (Correct me if I'm wrong in what follows, Bob.)   

   The attack on RSA-429 used ppmpqs.  However an asymtotically better
algorithm known as NFS (Number Field Sieve), might have been faster if
it were well enough developed for this sort of project.  (The behavior
of ppmpqs and nfs are similar vis-a-vis sharing and being memory
bandwidth limited.)  Someone working on cracking 512-bit keys/primes
should be using NFS.  A hypothetical someone trying to crack 1024-bit
keys should be working on new algorithms.

    So the proper answer to,  "How long are 1024-bit keys safe?" is
"About three breakthroughs in factoring algorithms."  Bob gave you the
best available information on how long that will take, but it has
nothing to do with how the question was framed.  (Parallel hardware
and secret NSA hardware technology are a red herring,  classified
progress in factoring algorithms would not be...)

    How long an RSA key length should you use?  While 1024-bits is
probably safe for a quite while, there is no reason not to use
1280-bits.  (PGP as distributed is limited to 1280-bits, and I think
some versions make generating 1280-bit keys difficult.  Of course, I
would recommend using something other than PGP to generate your public
key, but I digress.)  Anything that makes 2048-bit keys attackable is
so far beyond current technology that guesses as to what key length
will be suggested if 2048-bit keys ever fall are just that, total
guesses.

To him. And he MEANT nut cases, crazies, flat earthers, men who are being
bombarded by rays from flying saucers, men who have invented perpetual
motion machines, etc. etc. etc.

Bernstein feels that the Einsteins, who break major new ground, start from
what is known, build on it, perhaps refute part of it, and go on from there.
The nut cases, on the other hand, as he put it to me, start from the middle
of the air, and end in the middle of the air. (again his words).

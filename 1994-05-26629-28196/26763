You pad the data until the length becomes an even multiple of 8.
 
If the file is an ASCII file, pad with e.g. binary zeroes.  Padding with
binary zeroes can be used on binary files too, if it's not important to
retain the original file length.
 
If the file is binary AND it's important to be able to restore the original
file length, then pad with 1-8 bytes, and give the last byte a value of
binary 1-8, telling how many bytes were padded at the end.  Since the last
byte is a "pad length indicator", padding must ALWAYS be added to such a
binary file.  If its length already is an even multiple of 8, another 8
bytes must be padded:

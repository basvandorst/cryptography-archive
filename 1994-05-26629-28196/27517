Right.  And the world will really only need about six computers anyway.

I think you should seek out some people involved with aeronautical 
engineering or, better, geophysical modelling and analysis.  I assure
you that they have *plenty* of use for as much CPU bandwidth they can
get, and they have the bucks to pay for it.

"Beyond what's likely useful."  Remember that, Mr. Sternlight, when 
you peruse the "What's New In Computing" columns in a few years.

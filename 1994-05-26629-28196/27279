And of course, you've rigorously verified that each and every one of those
messages came from a different, real person, haven't you?  We eagerly await the
disclosure of your validation methods and presentation of ironclad proof that
you've received "quite a bit of...support."

Since you're making exactly the same sort of claim that CPSR made, I think it's
only fair that you should be held to the same standards as you insisted on for
CPSR--don't you?

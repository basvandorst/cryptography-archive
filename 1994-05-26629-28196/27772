ATM for Automatic Teller Machine, at least in the US-English speaking
part of the world.

That is presuming there is such a correlation.  I always thought that
was something they did in the old days, but which has been abandoned
as a Bad Idea, precisely for the reasons Serge gives.

As a matter of fact, the contract for my ATM card states clearly that
it shall be impossible, given the information on the card, to
reconstruct the PIN.  So if the situation is as Serge indicates, the
bank has broken their side of the contract.  Now if they did, the hard
part is to prove it.  (These guys proabably believe in security
through obscurity  :-)

Has anyone examined the captioned patent "Multiple independent binary bit
stream generator" which issued 8/17/93.

Has anyone examined the '94 IEEE paper by Gregory L Mayhew "A low cost,
high speed encryption system and method".  (author's address is Hughes
Aircraft, Fullerton, CA).

Mayhew states his paper does not infringe Snow's patent.  However, a
close reading may not substantiate this.

Also, it is unclear what Snow's part in the patent is exactly.  Brian
Snow is supposedly a higher ranking government official at NSA, and
apparently Snow has patented methods near and dear to his employer,
namely, linear and non-linear shift register sequence technology.

Request clarification.

Thanks.

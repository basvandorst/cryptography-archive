Most FAQ files, including sci.crypt, are archived for anonymous ftp at
rtfm.mit.edu [18.70.0.209] and can be found in /pub/usenet/name.of.group.
*** rtfm.mit.edu is very useful.  Remember it ***

(If you can't use ftp, you can use the mail server: send a message to
mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu containing "help".)

The FAQs are also available via the WWW at
http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/FAQ-List.html

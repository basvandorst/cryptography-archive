Isn't that exactly what you have done?

I am enraged by an organization such as the COFR which has
internally determined that a few "intellectuals" know what is
"best" for the rest of us.  A group which percieves the population
without the COFR as "lemmings".

However, as you pointed out this is a "political" issue and
therefore should not be addressed here. 

Further, your editorial on Davids introspective position in the
"New World Order" is without foundation and should be ignored.

Regardless of Davids political position, I find his comments in
this group (sci.crypt) entertaining and usually informed (wheater I
agree with his position or not).

If you have something to say, select the appropriate forum, speak
with subjective content and sign your name to the bottom line.

Your clandestine editorial tends to indicate that you are indeed a
"lemming".

P.S.  If you think your anonymity can be preserved in Berkeley you
don't truly understand the COFR (or Berkeley).

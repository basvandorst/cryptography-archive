That would be pretty interesting if it's true (I have no idea if it is
or not --- trusting a Usenet posting for accurate information is about
as smart as trying to surf using a slab of concrete(*)).  Given the 
overwhelming numbers of people who disagree with almost anything Sternlight
says, it certainly adds credence to John Perry Barlow's article in the
most recent CACM:  that the selection procedure for those in power in
Washington lends itself to including only a certain "type" of person, who
happens to be very unrepresentative of the American public.

(*) - Being new to Texas, I figured it was my duty to work on my "cute
      metaphores" and try to be more like Ross Perot.  As you can tell,
      I need a lot of work...  :-)

Hi all!
I just went into a bookshop for ordering this book (in the UK).
surprisingly they told me that it is a very new book and was published
in APRIL 1994!!!
so now I have some questions about it:

1.: Does anybody already have this "new" book?
2.: Does it contain corrections of the many errors mentioned here?
3.: Message <2qrbs4$2fs@qualcomm.com> says that there is some trouble
    with the disc contained in this book. Is the "new" book without
    this disc?
4.: If the disc is missing/modified is it still possible to make full
    use of this book?
The ISBN is: 0471 597562
Many thanks in advance!
Volker

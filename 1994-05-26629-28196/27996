A while ago, people who seemed like they knew what they were talking
about were saying things on this thread.  Now it appears that people who
haven't the same background are discussing it instead.  Now, I'm no
expert either, but I remember this one being answered earlier on.  The
answer is:

No, it wouldn't lead to new cyphers.  At least, not cyphers as we
understand them.  Cyphers have keys, and those keys have some number of
bits.  If you have some known plaintext, you can test a guess at the key
by seeing if it encrypts to the same cyphertext.  A quantum computer can
try all the possible keys, in parallel, to find the correct one.  If you
can think of a way of using another quantum computer to find a way
around this, think very hard if it's really true before you post.

(There are "cyphers" based on quantum mechanical principles that are
provably secure but depend on using purpose-built data links to send the
message.)

And I'm fairly convinced that there's no danger anyone will build such
a computer any time soon.  We can't even tell what kind of macroscopic
event (if any) causes reduction of the state vector; trying to find out
is far more difficult than we can think of doing at the moment. 
Building such a computer is vastly more difficult than that again.

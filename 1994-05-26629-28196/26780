: The experiment you suggested was done. It produced singularly unpersuasive

: The results it produced were:

And I did a mathematical analysis that showed the *expected* number of 
responses was between 2 and 170, with a most probable number near 17.

All assumptions of my analysis were explicitly shown. 

You, on the other hand, have never shown either why my analysis was 
flawed or even how you computed YOUR expected number of responses (to be 
more precise - you never even stated what your expected number of 
responses *was*, only that you didn't believe that 30 responses were 
reasonable).

Thirty responses was well inside the range of the expected.

: In a time interval comparable to the one in which CPSR reported another
: 10,000, I got about another 30.

Consistent. Borderline dishonest, since you explicitly stated you wouldn't 
accept any more after the first run, but still consistent with the first run.

: I counted every response I got as valid and didn't even try to check
: them--thus giving every benefit I could to your notion.

: I was not persuaded, and those who don't like my views on Clipper and HATED
: the results I got then spent a lot of time arguing that it didn't prove
: anything.

Hated the results? No - despised the twisting of conclusions and 
misrepresentation of facts by you. The *results* were perfectly consistent 
with the numbers quoted by the CPSR. Your *interpretation* was what was 
found to be objectionable and unsupportable by the facts. 

By the way - I got an A on my Informal Logic final paper showing how 
utterly flawed your argument against the validity of the petition was. 
(Thought I should update you since I said I would).

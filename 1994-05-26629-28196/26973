I tried compiling it with DJGPP, the GNU compiler for dos. It compiled
cleanly (or almost ... I couldn't remember), and it seemed to run, but
it produced lots of errors on the test data provided, and completely
incorrect results, so I gave up... wonder why this was the case, though.
Could've been a compiler bug...

I'll be sure to give it another shot when we will try to crack the PGP
key with ID 0xB33E65 (because the owner probably wants it revoked but
threw the whole bunch away ;)

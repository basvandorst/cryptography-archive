  Errr... PGP encrypts the text proper with IDEA, and encrypts the randomly
selected IDEA key with RSA.
  A pure-RSA encryption, in addition to being terribly slow, would be
vulnerable to known-plaintext attacks, since anybody can encrypt the
guessed plaintext with the recipient's public key -- if the guess is
correct, the result will match the cyphertext.

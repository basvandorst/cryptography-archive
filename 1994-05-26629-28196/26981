Lou Scheffer posts a messsage in which, after taking me to task for asking
the question the way I did, answers it in my terms.

Unfortunately, with his assumptions it takes just under 4 months to break a
1024 bit key, and another expert message recently posted has such keys
lasting for 20 to 40 years.

Is it any wonder I find the kind of impressionistic "off the top of one's
head" analysis I'm seeing here a trial, and suggest a careful and detailed
analysis is needed. I have to say as one looking for a practical answer that
seems reliable, that so far the various experts here have not distinguished
themselves.

I have to add that given the discrepancies in the answers of those who did
take the trouble (thanks) to do the problem in the terms I suggested, any
remarks calling the rationality of my own concerns and questions into doubt
are singularly unpersuasive.

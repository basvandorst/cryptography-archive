Okay, the Clipper screech fest and RSA-129 threads have both
degenerated to a who is more connected brag off.  The idea of
sci.crypt is to discuss the science of cryptography.  Please, if you
want to tell everybody how you invented Fortran or saved the world or
would like to hint that you have a low serial number security
clearance (but can't confirm for security reasons) take it to some
other group where everybody reads Jane's Book of Aircraft with only
one hand.

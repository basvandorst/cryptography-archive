In article <1994May4.044307.23177@mp.cs.niu.edu>,
jim thomas <tk0jut1@mp.cs.niu.edu> wrote the same mixture of half-truths,
distortions, and outright misrepresentations he's done in the past, while
accusing me of such practices.

Thomas continues to try to change the subject from CPSR's behavior
to mine, when it is THEIR "petition" which is the issue.

It's a very old tactic but it no longer works. Thomas has used it several
times too often.

That's a thinko -- it took them 5 days on a 486 based box.  NSA wants
them to prove that they are as insecure as 40 bit RSA before they can
get their export licence.  If you know how to do this, Tom Rearick of
the Lotus Word Processing Division may want to hear from you (he's at
Tom_Rearick.LOTUS@CRD.lotus.com).

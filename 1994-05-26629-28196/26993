This is what I get using off-the-shelf software (PGP) on an old
workstation (DECstation 5000/200, about 20 MIPS).  A low-end PowerPC
should be at least twice as fast.  All keys have 17-bit public
exponents, which might explain the difference between encryption and
decryption (because of the bigger secret exponents for bigger keys).

key generation:

bits      time (s)    time to type random keystrokes (s)
1024        19        190
2048       390        350
3072      1640        560
4096      1870        740

encryption:

bits      time (s)    size overhead (bytes)
1024         0.0       170
2048         0.1       300
3072         0.3       430
4096         0.5       560

decryption and signature times are the same:

bits      time (s)
1024         1.1
2048         7.2
3072        22
4096        50


Draw your own conclusions.

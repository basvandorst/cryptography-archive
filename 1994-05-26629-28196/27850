K>I'm just wondering. What is this PGP thing?


        Funny I thought almost everyone must know it by now :-)
        It is great tool for securing your E-mail. You can
        get if FREE and it contains great documentation (in
        file format of course) and IT CONTAINS SOURCES !
        I would say it is great deal. You can get it at
        least with FTP from nic.funet.fi. Sorry I don't
        remember the directory and this NIC is quite
        big thing. Get it and the FAQ then you would be
        pretty good informed.

        This PGP is a good example of governments wanting
        to keep things at their hands ... you heard of the
        Orwell ?

        OPS the last important thing it is Mr. Zimmerman who
        is the nice guy and he is taking quite a bit
        trouble now for being so nice.

        Best Regards

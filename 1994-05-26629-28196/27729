The RIPEM documentation is exportable and obtainable from the author's site.
In addition, an authentication-only version of RIPEM is exportable in object
code form and is available from the author's site. Although that version
cannot encrypt or decrypt it can do everything else and thus can give a good
idea of the RIPEM user interface. There's also a RIPEM/SIG Mac.

The RIPEM documentation contains extensive descriptive material on PEM
certificates. I recommend the documentation for RIPEM Mac, which has a more
full implementation.

The site is ripem.cl.msu.edu

The author's name is Mark Riordan.

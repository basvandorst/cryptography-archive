I just read an advertisement for an encryption device built by Allied
Signal Communications Systems called the "KIV-7".  Here are a couple of
excerpts from the advertisement:

"...it is interoperable with the Government-standard KG-84.  And, with NSA
Type 1 Endorsement, the KIV-7 complies with the most stringent security
requirements."

"Even more remarkable, its Crypto Ignition Key (CIK) declassifies the unit
and prevents unauthorized access."

What, exactly is the "KG-84" standard?  Is it classified?  If not, where
can it be obtained?  What is this "Type 1 Endorsement"?  Thanks.

Oh, be nice now.  Just a one line request to keep this material
out of groups where it is not part of the discussion, along with a
copy of the post (so that they know exactly what you are referring
to) from *each* person, and each person replying to the post from *each*
newsgroup they find it in, should be sufficient.  :^)

Harvest was described in the literature in 1960.  See chapter 17 of
``Planning a Computer System'', Werner Buchholz, ed., McGraw-Hill,
1961; it cites a paper from the 1960 Western Joint Computer Conference
as the source of most of the information.

To be fair, the chapter doesn't call it Harvest, and doesn't say it was
for the NSA.  I first learned of it in a computer architecture course
taught by Fred Brooks ~20 years ago; he referred to a number of
architectures as intended for code-breaking.  I developed a good feel
for what such an architecture would look like, but I didn't really
understand just how those instructions helped -- until I started
designing my own cryptanalytic tools...

Well, here is one method based on diode junction noise:

Run the noise signal through a wideband amplifier, then
use a Schmitt-trigger or similar device to shape it into
a rectangular wave. Use the output to drive a toggle
flip-flop. Now you have a bit that changes randomly, and
you can sample this at a much lower frequency than the
nominal frequency of the f-f. This should produce a
stream of truly random and independent bits.

You would have to be very careful with the design, so
that the circuit isn't adversely influenced by any
external, non-random signals.

Consider:

1) Whenever Sternlight demands citations or "evidence" from his post and
   others produce, his predictable style is either to a) ignore the
   evidence, b) quibble over semantics (the infamous SSQ or "Sternlight
   Semantic Quibble"); c) Squeal that he is being defamed. The guy
   seems impervious to evidence, sees truth as "defamation," and
   as a demonstrable history of "truth gaps."

2) A typical Sternlight comment on public debate:

>I'm not going to reargue any of the substance of the Clipper debate because
>I think it to be a done deal. Check out the Leahy hearings tomorrow for
>clues as to whether I'm right in this supposition or not.
 
There are several ways to interpret the above passage. It is not 
unreasonable to include among those ways the interpretation given by
the poster. FWIW, Sternlight's supposition on the Leahy hearings suggests
that, in earlier times, he would have been comfortable as a Delphi priest.

3) Sternlight complains that truth defames him. Given his sophistry in
research methods, it's not surprising.

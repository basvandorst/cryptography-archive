Hi, does anyone know of any recent advancements on the clipper chip encryption?
I don't get to read this area often so please e-mail me if you have any info.

I'm in Australia so I don't get to hear much about it, but I think it's a very
important thing with far-reaching consequence, so I'd like to keep my finger
on the pulse, so to speak....


Thanks in advance...

Mark

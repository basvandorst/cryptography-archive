I've seen a lot of discussion about breaking 512, 1024, 2048 bit RSA keys.
Now, can anyone tell me what kind of key length is feasible from the 
encoding point of view ? 

Suppose I have a regular workstation, like a small Sun-Sparc, and I use 
a traditional encryption method for the message, and I only use RSA to
transmit its key. So, I only need one RSA encryption. 

If my message is considered to be extremely secure, I guess I can afford to
wait a couple of seconds, or even a minute for the encryption... 

How long is the maximum RSA key I can use ? 1024 bits ? 2048 bits ? 4096 ?

If the answer is: 20000 bits, then all the discussion about NSA spending 
billions of dollars on CM-5's and special hardware becomes useless, as 
nobody is ever going to crack that without very significant improvements in 
algorithms .... and nobody will be able to predict if that's going to happen.

Can anyone give some indications about this ?

ciao,

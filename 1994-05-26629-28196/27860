Like all other such messages on web-of-trust, this message misses the
elementary point that it is the reader of signed public posts that must
decide whether to trust the key signers/certifiers, not the poster. This
creates a major security hole in web-of-trust unless one goes to what
amounts to a certification heirarchy similar to the PEM one. PGP's present
system is simply unworkable as it is now practiced, for authentication of
public posts to, for example, internet newsgroups. If I don't know most
posters well enough to trust them, and I don't know most people's chosen key
signers well enough to trust them, I cannot trust the posted messages.

At least with certification authorities:

1. They have published standards;

2. They have formal safeguards, often including expensive high-security
certification hardware;

3. I only need their one public key in my public key file to authenticate
every post carrying their certificate;

4. I can get a copy of the public key of any poster, that I can trust as far
as I trust the certification authority based on 1 and 2 above, from the
certificate in his public post, without fussing with servers, direct
dealing, etc.

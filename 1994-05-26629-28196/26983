"Science Friday" on National Public Radio will air a show on encryption 
this Friday afternoon.  It would be good to have some CPSR folks call
in.

If you want more information, you can call 202-414-2000 and ask for
"Talk of the Nation."  The broadcast, as you may know, is between 2-4
PM (Eastern).  The number to call to get on the program is 1-800-989-8255.
I think the trick is to call during the five minute news segment that airs
just before the program starts.  (There's about 30 seconds worth of promo
material about the upcoming segment on the hour, and then a cut-away for
news, with the program starting at about 1405 (of 1505 for the second hour).

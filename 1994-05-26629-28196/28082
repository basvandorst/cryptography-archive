   I'll ammend my statement:
 
   I wouldn't trust MD5 for any application where:
 
1.  Finding two meaningful-looking messages that have the same MD5
    value will allow an attacker to defeat my security.
and
2.  Defeating my security will either be worth millions today, or
    must remain difficult for many, many years.
 
   For long-term digital contracts, I'd like to see a long hash, maybe
256 bits long.  If I were setting things up now, I'd probably combine
three different hashes, each appearing to be secure.  N-HASH and Snefru
with enough rounds, plus MD5 or SHA.  (I'd want them based on as different
a set of operations as possible.)

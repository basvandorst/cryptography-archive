Robert Eachus questions as follows:

       I'm really confused by that statement.  If the government licenses
       PGP 2.6 for export (and since David repeated the phrase "licensed for
       export," I can't believe he missed it), is it possible for such an
       export to still be found illegal under ITAR?  Talk about a "chilling
       effect on the First Ammendment," not to mention entrapment!  Sheesh!

This may result from a confusion between licensing of patents and licensing
export.
More likely, it arises from the ridiculous hypothesis. 

There is absolutely no chance that the United States government would license
PGP as we think of it for export.  They might license it with 512 bit modulus.
They might license it with a crippled block cipher or with a shortened effective
key length.  There is not one chance in eternal hell that they would license
IDEA and RSA with 1024, much less 2048, bit modulus.  Not one, not now, not
ever.  They still hope to outlaw them within the US.

While those of us in the US, particularly Phil Zimmerman and Grady Ward, must
care, no one else does.  "All the king's horses and all the king's
men............"  They take themselves and this issue so seriously, but outside
their borders they are a laughing stock.

It is hard to know where to start with the posting from

No. But the idea is that N should be hard to factor, so it is best
to make N the product of two large primes.

Yes, because then N would be easy to factorise.

It isn't true, and it can't be so used.  RSA encryption will work, in
the sense that you can run an encrypt/decrypt cycle, even with
a hopelessly insecure key.

No, but there are special tests for Mersenne primes that are a lot
quicker than for ordinary primes of similar size. 

If you want more detail on RSA try the PGP or RSA FAQs.

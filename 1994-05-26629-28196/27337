This precomputation attack is well-known in cryptography, and the solution
is to make sure there are too many possibilities to store.

For example, it depends on what you mean by "all known primes".  There
are known ot be an infinite number, so that's clearly impossible.
If, on the other hand, you mean all numbers which have been tested and
found to be prime, the problem is that it is fantastically improbable
that a randomly-chosen prime of the sizes under consideration has
ever been considered before, or ever will be considered again in the
lie of the universe.  For a 512-bit prime, there are 2^512/ln(2^512),
which, using a crude approximation of ln(8) = 2, results in something
like 2^502 possible primes, or 4*10^150.  This exceeds the number of
subatomic particles in the universe by a very large margin.

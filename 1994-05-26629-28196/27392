This statement is horseshit. It has hardly "shaken the cryptographic
community". The statement "does not yet exist" is also garbage, because
it implies that a quantum computer such as the one described by Shor
*can* exist and that assumption is nonsense.

It has been known for a long time that if there existed a machine
which could multiply integers in unit time regardless of size 
then one could factor in polynomial time. Big Deal. Such a computer
does not exist nor will it ever exist.

Mr. Shor's work may be fine mathematics, but the computer is pie-in-the-sky
fantasy.

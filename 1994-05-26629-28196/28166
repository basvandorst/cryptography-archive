I sent David mail explaining about the 5000 MIPS/years theoretical
timeframe, and gave him a number: approximately 1.5e17 instructions
total. I also said that if the 25x harder figure was true, that it would
be about 125000 MIPS/years (duh). Just for public edification, that's
around 3.8e18 instructions.

In the method we used, each tidbit of info we collect is much more important
in later steps than in early steps.  While any one tidbit is just a small
clue, they begin to form groups (cycles) which give us real clues.

So, all along, we knew how many cycles we needed.  We just had a guess (which
came out close I may add :) to how many tidbits we would need.

I'm currently constructing a proposal to have Kerberos implemented on the
network here at Miami University (Oxford, Ohio).  In _Applied
Cryptography_, Schneier suggests several documents for more information on
Kerberos.  Unfortunately, I've been unable to find them in the library
here, or on Ohio-Link, the Ohio interlibrary loan system.


Is there anyone that can point me towards a source for these documents?

- -> J. T. Kohl, "The Evolution of the Kerberos Authentication
   Service," EurOpen Conference Proceedings, May 1991, pp 295-313

- -> T. Jin, "Care and Feeding of Your Three-Headed Dog, Doc. Number"
   IAG-90-012, Hewlett-Packard, May 1990

- -> T. Jin, "Living with Your Three Headed Dog", Doc. Number
   IAG-90-012, Hewlett-Packard, May 1990

It appears I need to request the T. Jin documents from Hewlett-Packard. 
Does anyone know how I go about doing this?



Also, I think I'll be able to find this at Wright State University, but if
anyone knows of another convenient source:

- -> S.M. Bellovdin & M. Merritt, "Limitations of the Kerberos 
   Protocol", Winter 1991, USENIX Conference Proceedings, 1991,
   pp253-267.


Do you know of other documents, or sources on the net that I should be
checking out?  I'd appreciate any help anyone has to offer.

thanks in advance,
- -john.

   Problem: you're computing only 4 words/passphrase. If your
attacker knows you're using 4-word sentences, then you deserve to
be cracked. Your computation, according to your own criteria,
should include 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 word sentences. Add em all up.
Then you get 1.29E18, which is eight million times bigger and
gives 60 bits of security-- not totally transparent, unless NSA has
built a special SFS cracking machine that's stronger than their DES
crackers....
 
   There's an assumption here that the attacker knows you're using
complete grammatical sentences. For the sufficiently paranoid, I
guess that's a reasonable assumption (NSA raids your hard disk and
finds only SFS, DISKREET and Windows, and inwardly smiles "Aha!
Crypto Dork!"). <insert smiley, dammit>

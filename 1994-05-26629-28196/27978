	I've heard that LSFR based stream ciphers are fairly easy to break. 
How do I do it? I assume that with any deterministic RNG, that given the 
seed, you can get the entire stream. I would like to see a crypto-secure 
PRNG that is reasonably fast. I want this so I can write a program to do 
stream ciphers.

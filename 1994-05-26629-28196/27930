Hello:

A few days ago I posted this request:

> In Applied Cryptography, Bruce Schneier suggests that the Digital
> Signature Standard/Algorithm is, for the moment, royalty-free. He also
> notes that the patent and licensing rights may be given to PKP.

> Can anyone comment on the current status? Is it okay to use this

Unluckily, my current service provider has disintigrated, and I can only
get email from the net. Could those who have replied to this post please
email copies of their replies to me? I'm posting this via a remailer, so
please note the Compu$erve address below. Thank-you.

Regards,
Reginald !:-)

Suppose thousands of users have the ability to use 1024 bit RSA
encryption to send messages back and forth. How many computers
can you ensure for Security? Is it possible?

The RSA-129 is a very interesting benchmark. Probably the only
one in existence on this issue.

It took 14 years to solve a usless message.

Isn't part of the PURPOSE of cryptology is to SOLVE a message
BEFORE its usefulness expires???

I think that PGP certainly solves this issue.

That's not very comforting, Paul.

Suppose the NSA has the ability to put 100 times as many parallel processors
on the job, in the form of a Connection Machine type of hardware. Not an
unreasonable assumption.

Suppose they have 10 times the CPU speed. Based on today's technology, not
an unreasonable assumption.

Suppose they spend 10 times more (in hours per day)--since your participants
apparently were computing part time, and perhaps at lower effective speed if
the work stations were doing other things as well. This one is a bit
shaky--I don't have the data on the usage efficiency of all those volunteer
workstations.

Then we're down to only twice as time-consuming to do a 1024 bit key.

Now suppose they have algorithms that are just a little better...


You can see why I'm not sanguine about the security of 1024 bit keys against
rich and powerful adversaries, given the RSA-129 result.

Especially given the expert forecasts in the same Scientific American
article on how long it would take for RSA-129 to fall.

Am I missing something here?

Astounding.  You posted a question for which an answer to your specifications
would require about as much work as the average term paper.  Then you get
huffy when people take the time to answer your query to a few levels
of approximation, and tell them they should have "kept silent" instead
if they couldn't meet your standards.  And you accuse *others* of being
arrogant?

Not really.  The question is not worth asking in the form you asked it,
which required generating impossibly precise figures for unknown conditions.
The answer you *did* get was adequate for the issue at stake, which is
whether long-key RSA will remain secure beyond our lifetimes barring
an algorithmic breakthrough.  Getting snotty because someone doesn't
care to pin down which day in the twenty-fifth century the key will be
cracked is ridiculous.  As has already been pointed out to you,
the error bars in the educated guesses that are required make generating
any answer more precise than a couple of orders of magnitude a useless
exercise.

I believe that was his point to you, David.

Unlike, say, attempting to bolster one's position by publicly alluding to
alleged email applauding one's actions?

Breaking RSA would indeed produce the secret primes p and q, which would indeed
be the factorization of n.  However, this only provides a way for factoring
n, when n is a product of two primes.  If n is the product of multiple primes,
(as are most numbers), it is doubtful that this will work....


So, breaking RSA =/=> factoring n  (in the general case.)

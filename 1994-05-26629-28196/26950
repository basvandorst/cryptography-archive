Greetings. I'm looking for all sorts of material on the Clipper proposal
for an article I'm writing for a fanzine. I'm looking for both positive
and negative material on the Clipper chip, and any information on how the
public feels about it. I'd also like to know whence I can download 
Clipper information put out by anti-clipper groups (EFF, CPSR) and
pro-clippper groups (FBI, NSA, White House). You can email me or post
replies on sci.crypt, talk.politics.crypto, or org.cpsr.talk.

Thanks

Ender

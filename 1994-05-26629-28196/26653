Let's see--if we scale the above by a correction factor equal to the number
of years since the Scientific American Article that RSA-129 fell,
divided by
the number of years the experts in the article thought it would take for it
to fall, what do we get?

Hm, hm, di-diddle, (I like to sing when I sew), dumty di....

Nonetheless, in the world of the small cheap computer the advantage is
always to the cryptographer, never to the cryptanalyst.  The cost of
attack rises exponentially with the value of the key while the cost of
encryption rises only linearly.

[At the Fort they like to say that consenting to the DES was the
"biggest damn fool mistake" since Eisenhower appointed Earl Warren to be
Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.  Actually, they should never ever
have given that money to von Neumann.]

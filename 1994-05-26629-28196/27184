This platitude is simplistic and wrong. A person like Isaac Newton could be
both a nutty Rosicrucian and a first rate creative mind. No less a person
as Bishop Berkeley pointed out (correctly) the fallacy of Newton's
'infinitesimals'.

I would much rather be around people who take intellectual risks than 
around those who complain and whine about how new ideas don't fit 
into their fixed scheme of nested heavenly polygons.

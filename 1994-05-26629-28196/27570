    I heard that some one has solved the open problem on
the characterization of access structures that permit
ideal secret sharing schemes (using matroid theory).

    Some partial results were already known and these are
due to Brickell, Davenport, Martin and Benny Chor.

    Apparently the new complete characterization was done by
a person from the former Yugoslavia and is presented at the
rump session in Eurocrypt'94. Can any one who has more information
on it please post a messagge or mail me the information
to gopal@cse.unl.edu

    Thanks,

I think that the key point in the original post was that two different
algorithms are used in the process, breaking either of them will reveal the
plaintext that was encrypted, and that unless they are equally hard to
break, one of them is of necessity "weaker".  From a user's prespective,
determining which is weaker is irrelevant.  That's the cryptanalyst's job to
figure out.  A cautious (or even "paranoid") user would have to assume the
worst case that the cryptanalyst KNEW which was weaker and would attack that
one.  Even if he just GUESSED, he's have a 50% chance of being correct.

Of course, if a person really thought that RSA was the STRONGER of the two
links in the chain, there's nothing to stop him/her from successively
encrypting something with RIPEM (which uses TDES) and then with PGP (which
uses IDEA).  Even if RSA was the weakest of the three methods, recursively
encrypting with two programs, using two different key at least DOUBLES the
effort required.

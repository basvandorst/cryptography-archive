You have misunderstood my claim.  I claim that my definition of natural
law subsumes the currently existing notions of natural law-- much 
as relativity provided a formal descriptive framework that subsumes
Newtonian mechanics--  The new definition's properties are identical to
the preexisting definition's properties in the limited scope that the
preexisting definition addresses, but the new definition also has 
additional implications beyond that scope.  This synthesis is the essence
of formal innovation in "fields of inquiry".  In fairness, I could have
made this clearer, although the rather flamy post by Grady following
yours attests to the fact that some readers, at least, understood me
as I intended them to.

Is the tactless phrase "nut cases" attributable to you or him?  Please
clarify.

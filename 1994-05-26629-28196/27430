Yes, but even if you manage to get the cryptogram out of the plaintext
by using the public key, you have know idea about the secret key, so
what would the plaintext attack actually give you?

One other question - maybe silly:
If RSA (or actually any algorithm) is used for authentication in
a simple challenge - response configuration, ie. one partner (A) sends
a challenge that the other (B) encrypts using his private key; how can
B know that the challenge really is a random number and not for example
the hash of some document that A wants B to sign without B knowing it?

Of course this can be resolved with proper agreement and/or precisely
defined algorithms. Any knowledge about how this is done in existing
systems?

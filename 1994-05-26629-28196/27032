Let's compare apples and apples.  You said something to the effect of: the
petition's #'s are false, most of the 'signatures' are undoubtably bogus. 
Since then you have 'clairified' your position (backpedeled) to be some of
the signatures are undoubtably bogus.  Undoubtably is a big word. 
Probably another 'slip', but the fact remains that I remember it being
used.  Maybe not in your revised 'even CPSR agrees with me' statement but
I have not seen undoubtably recanted.

[ I never even attacked the petition itself. 

Tell me David, what is the difference between attacking the #'s of
signatures and attacking the petition?

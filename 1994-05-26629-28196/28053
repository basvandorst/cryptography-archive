This is a stream cipher, and the quality of the keystream
generator is crucial to the security. If the keystream
generator is a PRNG of the linear-congruential type, for
instance, the cipher can be cracked trivially using only
a few bytes of known plaintext. All you need to do is
XOR the known plaintext with the ciphertext. This lets
you obtain part of the keystream, and hence the internal
state of the PRNG. Then the rest of the ciphertext can
easily be decrypted.

On the other hand, large linear feedback shift registers
(LFSRs) with nonlinear combiners are regarded as a secure
type of keystream generator. Another good generator consists
of a block cipher, such as DES or IDEA, run in output
feedback mode (OFB).

Do you know which particular PRNG this person had in mind?

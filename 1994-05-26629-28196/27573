Is there a public domain version of the "crypt" program around? That is,
a program which is functionally compatible with crypt but which I could
get in Canada (the sun OS shipped to Canada doesn't have crypt, but then
I guess everyone in this group knows that already!). I got the pgp25
program, but I can't tell from a quick glance if it is compatible with
crypt, even if I could get it to compile. Thanks.

Dave

bnr's paul van oorschot had a survey paper on this topic in
crypto '90, with 34 references. this isn't extremely current,
but from his references you could use the science citation index
to find more current work. for strength as good as 512-bit rsa,
dlp then needed 40 fewer key-bits.

more recently, there was a paper by adleman and demarrais at crypto
'93, "a subexponential algorithm for discrete logarithms over all
finite fields," again with lots of citations.
their expected running time was exp(c sqrt( log( p^n) loglog( p^n))).

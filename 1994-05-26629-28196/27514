Prelude: on the 19th October 1993, Sir Harry Hinsley, the 
official historian of British Intelligence in World War II, gave 
a seminar on 'The Influence of ULTRA in the Second World War' to
the Cambridge University Computer Laboratory.
 
The talk was recorded and I've had it transcribed.  Mark Lomas 
turned it into HTML and it's installed on the Security Group's 
World-Wide Web pages.  They are at:

Having been at Sir Harry's lecture, I've become interested in the 
history of Enigma after the end of World War II.  Little seems to 
be known or have been published about the latter phases of its 
life.  
 
After a little reading, some facts emerge that indicate that 
Enigma continued to be used for a number of years.  Bureaucrats 
ignored certain evidence and experts' misgivings despite its 
weaknesses being known from early times.
 
More information, particularly references, would be most welcome.
 
Best regards, Keith Lockstone.
 
 
 
1.  After World War II, Enigma machines continued to be 
    manufactured and sold by the West Germans and the Swiss - 
    seemingly oblivious to the success of Ultra. They were sold 
    widely in Africa, the Middle East and South America for the 
    purposes of diplomatic and military traffic. [PIN78] 
    
2.  Swiss intelligence knew of the breaking of the German Naval 
    Enigma ciphers in August 1943 and warned the Germans - who 
    chose to disbelieve it [KNI86]. 
 
3.  A lot of these machines presumably remained in use until 1974 
    when Winterbotham's book [WIN74] really let the cat out of 
    the bag. 
    
4.  Earlier published accounts (in the USA, France and Poland) 
    had strongly hinted that Enigma had been compromised, but 
    little notice seems to have been taken of the fact [KAHN67], 
    [HINS79]. Even a solution to an early Enigma was demonstrated 
    by a German cryptanalyst in the 1930s [KNI86]. 
 
5.  As far as is known, the Soviets did not warn any of the 
    Enigma users - because they could break the codes and were in 
    possession of the same intelligence as the UK/US.  This 
    should not have escaped the UK/US. [KNI88] 
 
6.  Second hand Enigmas are rare and it is difficult for anyone 
    to purchase one.  
    
7.  It must be assumed that those who used them after WW II would 
    have destroyed them when they found out they had been 
    compromised - to avoid embarrassment. 
 
8.  This all poses some interesting questions: 
 
    a)  Are there any Enigmas still in operational use?
 
    b)  When were the last ones taken out of service and by whom?
    
    c)  Who were the Swiss and German manufacturers involved?
    
    d)  What happened to all the captured Enigmas? (Did the 
        UK/US/USSR pass them on to other countries?)
 
    e)  How many Enigmas were sold after WW II?
 
    f)  How many of these were genuine captured models and how 
        many were of later manufacture? 
 
    g)  Which version was sold - the 3 or the 4 rotor 
        version?
 
    h)  Which version of the operating instructions were supplied 
        - the later or the earlier version?  (ie the 3 or the 
        easier to break, 6 letter 'indicator' [WELC82])  
 
    i)  Was any further development work done on the various 
        original German (WW II) models?
    
    i)  Are there any surplus Enigmas available?  The author 
        knows of a science museum in Cambridge (The Whipple 
        Museum) that would appreciate one - or any 1940s 
        cryptographic equipment.

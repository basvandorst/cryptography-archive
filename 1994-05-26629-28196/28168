An updated version of that article, with the same name, appears in the 
book, Distributed Open Systems, from IEEE Computer Society Press, 1994, 
edited by Brazier and Johansen. Also, my book Network and Internetwork 
Security, from Prentice Hall, due out in July, has a fairly detailed 
(about 20 pages) technical description of versions 4 and 5.

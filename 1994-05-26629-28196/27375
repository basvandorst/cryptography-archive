Oh, good grief!  If you are writing professionally and must be seriously
concerned with the fine points of punctuation, get the style guide that
your editor insists upon, be it the Chicago Manual of Style, The Harbrace
College Handbook, or the MLA Style Sheet.  There is no agreement, so make
your editor happy.

If you are not writing professionally, let's continue with crypto instead.

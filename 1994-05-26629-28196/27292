   As for the remainder of your concerns, the general consensus is that IDEA

   wrong) that RSA is weak against known-plaintext attacks, and hence is

Very well.  You are wrong.

RSA is resistent to known plaintext.  To see this, I suggest that you
fetch my PGP public key from a keyserver.  Then, encrypt as much
plaintext as you wish with it.  You now have an arbitrarily large
amount of chosen plaintext and its corresponding ciphertext.  Please
tell me how you hope to deduce my secret key from the information now
in your posession.

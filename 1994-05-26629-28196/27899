Actually, in 25 years computer chips will probably run on 2.5 volts or even
less. The reason is that the best way to make the circuits run faster is to
make them smaller, decreasing the distance the electrons must travel; but
if you don't decrease the voltage as you scale down, the volts per centimeter
applied to, say, a reverse-biased junction go up. This can be compensated
for by increasing doping, but soon you hit the breakdown limit. This limit has
already been reached in some devices, especially memory chips. TTL vs NMOS/CMOS
has little to do with it, it's an inherent property of silicon.( though it's 
true that CMOS does run faster as the voltage goes up, until it breaks down.)

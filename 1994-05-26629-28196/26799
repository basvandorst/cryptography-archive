Given the following hypotheses, one can calculate the number of bits needed
for a number to be unfactorable as a function of the minimum cost to factor
and the year in which the attack will be made.

1.  Cost to factor RSA-129 was $50,000.  This is a conservative lower 
	bound based on $10 per mips-year.  (Perhaps a 100mips machine
	selling for $20000, depreciated over 2 years, with off-peak
	time selling for 10%.)

2.  Cost to factor will be cut in half each year as a result of faster, more
	economical computers and algorithm improvements.

3.  Cost to factor a number n is proportional to
		exp( log(n)^(1/3) * log(log(n))^(2/3) )

I do not claim these hypotheses are true, but their implication for the number
of bits required to make a number unfactorable are as follows.



				Cost to factor
year		$10^3		$10^6		$10^9		$10^12

1994		  310		  536		  839		 1220

2000		  437		  709		 1062		 1506

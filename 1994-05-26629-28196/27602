the june '94 issue of the atlantic monthly has two articles
of cryptographic interest. in "technology: open secrets,"
james fallows surveys the clipper and digital wiretap
debates, while curiously neglecting the crypto export debate.
the subtitle is an apt summary: "why the so-called clipper
chip -- vilified as a threat to the privacy of electronic
communications -- is not worth losing sleep over." fallows
acknowledges that clipper's a bad idea, but doesn't buy the
ever-popular "slippery slope" argument that clipper will
someday be the only legal crypto algorithm. his understanding
of the past 20 years of commercial crypto isn't as strong as
he pretends, but it's better than i expected. i don't have
strong feelings about the digital telephony bill, so i found
fallows' discussion of it unobjectionable. btw, fallows
appended his email address for those who want to verbally
beat him up. i won't post it here -- read the magazine.

more interesting is seymour hersch's cover story, "the wild
east," about organized crime and nuclear weapons' insecurity
in the former ussr. he describes how bush provided nsa
intercepts of army & kgb traffic to yeltsin, during the
august '91 coup against gorbachev. the nsa did not like this,
for obvious reasons. i've been a fan of hersch's since he
made nixon's enemies list, so perhaps i'm biased, but i really
liked this article.

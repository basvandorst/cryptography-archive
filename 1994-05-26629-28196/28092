   It can, and that's how PURPLE was cracked.  However, note that the
PURPLE crack occured during peacetime (or at least nominal peacetime).
In wartime, speed is crucial, and military action or espionage can
often get you a copy of the opponents machine or code book faster than
cryptography.  (The cracking of Enigma was begun in peacetime, but
Poland was overrun before the first use of their contributions was
made by the British.)

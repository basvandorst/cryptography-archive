Noone really knows how long 1024 bits would take. There are some problems
involved. 

(1) The factor base would need to be MUCH larger. The final matrix reduction
    would be a big problem.
(2) The large factor base would mean the sieving program would not fit on an
     8 Meg machine. Many of the machines used for RSA-129 were 8meg. It
      would probably require 32 meg/machine.
(3) Noone knows how the o(1) term in the run time behaves up near 1024 bits.
     Projections would only be rough ballpark figures.

That said, it would take between 10^4 and 10^5 times as long to do 1024
bits as 512 bits. One would want to use more than 2 large primes on each
side.

This is an exaggeration.  It probably comes about from reading too much news,
since it exerts a lack of knowledge into the discussion.  If you are talking
about sending a message to someone that you don't want read in X time, where
X is in years (maybe, say, 50 years.  lots of crimes expire by then), you
have to take into account the increase in tech, the devaluation of us currency,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  fuck all of that.  use the biggest key that
you're willing to wait around to use.  if you're using IDEA instead of RSA, 
well, that's your problem, but don't dick around with hundred byte keys.  1024
bits = 128 bytes.

There are two reasons that I can think of to use RSA.

1) You want to fuck with people who try to read other people's mail by making
   them waste their time / give up because it's hopeless.

2) You have stuff that you don't want other people to read.

If 1), don't get your pants all wet about it.  If 2), make an evaluation of
the time value of what you're sending.  If it's of extreme value, use a 4096
bit key.  If it's of moderate value, use a 1024 bit key.  If it's of no value,
use a 512 bit key.

Let me expand upon this.  Anyone who doesn't know the difference between a
public-key cipher and RSA needs to go read the ABC's of encryption.  RSA is
a public-key cipher.  It is not THE ONLY public-key cipher.  If you want to
complain about RSA, complain about RSA, not TRAPDOOR functions in general.
jesus.

They leak information?  Like what?  A faucet?  A firehose?  What the fuck are
you talking about?  Get educated, man!

Again, PUBLIC KEY CIPHERS are NOT slow as molasses.  RSA is what you meant
to say.  And, by the way, bonehead, RSA is NOT as slow as molasses.  I can
get it to work on PC XT fast enough for my purposes.

True. (except for the lack of distinction between RSA and all public key 
cryptography)  Remember that this is a number-theoretic problem, and it is 
possible to achieve speedup with a little work.  I still don't see what the
problem is.  The encryption of a message as long as this one, with a key as
long as you could possibly need for a message of this type (say 512 bits)
is not a slow thing.  It is a fast thing.

You don't know what you're talking about.

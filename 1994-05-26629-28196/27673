   Uh, who do you think PKP is?  A patent consortium including MIT.
If they license patents to a party, then change the rules of the game
to make that license, as sold, useless, that is not capitalism, that
is either fraud or a violation of anti-trust law.

   As I said, MIT has not yet announced all the details of the PGP 2.6
release.  Since an agreement with ViaCrypt for commercial licensing
looks mutually beneficial, I have to suspect that it will happen.
However due to the number of players involved, it will probably take
time. (Also, since RSA, Inc. will probably also want to be able to
market PGP 2.6, I expect that any such license will not be exclusive.)

   We won't know the answer to the first question until we see PGP
2.6, perhaps not even then.  If 2.6 supports 2048 bit keys (which is
an easy way to create incompatibility ;-) and gets licensed for
export, I'd say upgrade.  (Or if RSA or PKP license a foreign, but
compatible version...)

    Note that MIT and Stanford can probably turn a pretty penny
licensing PGP 2.6 to OS vendors like Sun, Apple, and Microsoft, but
only if the US government gets out of the way...

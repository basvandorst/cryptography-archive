Andrew,

If you are willing to use a hybrid scheme, do what PGP does:  Encrypt
the bulk plaintext with some key k.  Then, encrypt k twice with
different keys a and b. Enclose the two encrypted keys and the encrypted
plaintext as fields in a packet whose structure is known.  Now anyone
with this packet and a key a or b can read the plaintext.  For each
additional key, the packet grows only by the size of that key.

Now, is that cheating? :)

Liam

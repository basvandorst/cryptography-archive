Yes, we do.

Mr. Sternlight said that RIPEM can have signed messages in which the
authenticity of the public-key can be assured in the same message, and that
PGP cannot do so.

Mr. Repenning's `one-word reply' was a PGP signed message in which the
authenticity of the public-key was assured in the same message.

To the pedantic: the authenticity is established to the extent to which one
trusts the people who signed his public-key, just as the authenticity of a
RIPEM key is established to extent to which one trusts the certifying
authority.  If there were one or more authorities trusted by PGP-users in
this manner, then PGP may be used just as RIPEM is.

To those to whom the purpose of Mr. Repenning's reply was clear: my
apologies for this message.

Later,
Rujith.

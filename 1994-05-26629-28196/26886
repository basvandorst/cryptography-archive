Symbol technologies has a two dimensional barcode which works in a similar
fashion.  It can encode text or binary data, encrpted files, etc onto a
paper.  The paper can be tranmitted by fax and re-scanned.  The paper can
also be marked up up to 33% and the data can still be recovered.

A 1K file can be stored in a couple of square inches.

It is called PDF 417 barcoding.

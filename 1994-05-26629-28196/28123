Sorry, you can't get there from here.

A one-time pad must be irreproducible--if you generate it from a key which
is (I presume) compactly represented, then you have what amounts to a
stream cipher. Since you aksed for a direction, I'll suggest you look at
using Output Feedback Mode to turn a block cipher into a stream cipher.

For more details, read "Applied Cryptography" by Bruce Schneier.

   In answer to the intensly vital question what is a "squemish ossifrage"

"squeamish" actually.

   after huge amounts of research (I looked in a dictionary) I can now reveal 
   that it is a nervous bone breaking bird, or a bone breaking bird of a sensitive
   disposition.
   The question now remains why is it squeamish and what bones is it going to
   break.
   And why on ert did they choose this phrase.


Ron Rivest claims that he decided on the words "THE MAGIC WORDS ARE "
and then opened a dictionary at random and picked two further words.
I have no reason to doubt him.

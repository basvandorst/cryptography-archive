Does someone else want to respond to this for me?

All I told Mr. Sternlight is that what he is looking for depends on
his economic assumptions and that it was HIS job to do the analysis.
Once one knows how much more difficult 512 bit keys are than RSA-129,
translating this into time is highly dependent on one's economic
assumptions. I have yet to see him provide such information. NOONE
is going to make wild speculations about what (yet to be designed)
custom-purpose hardware might yield in price/performance. There are
simply too many variables. All anyone can do is give order-of-magnitude
estimates. My perception is that *NO* answer would satisfy him.
He continues with one series of "What If" questions after another.
By the time one puts them all together, the error in the estimate
would exceed the main term.



Wild speculations about the capabilities of the NSA are useless.
If Mr. Sternlight really did once work for RAND he would know that
anyone who truly knows about the capabilities of the NSA would not
be able to discuss it in public. They themselves will not talk, nor
will they even say what their budget is. So the kind of answer he wants
is impossible to give under any conditions. Those in a position to do so can not
discuss it. [And I am *not* an NSA insider]


This highly insulting response to me is totally uncalled for.

I told you how hard 512 bits would be. How is my telling you that
providing the economic assumptions and doing the rest of the analysis
is YOUR job arrogant?

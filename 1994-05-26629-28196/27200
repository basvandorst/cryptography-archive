No it does not.  RSA relies (in part) upon factoring being difficult.  Not
proving the existence of anything, just factoring.  Factoring.

It is not true that "In most problems, proving the existence of some entity
is not makedly easier..."  It happens to be true of most of mathematics.
Existence proofs are ridiculously easier to create than constructive proofs.
That's why everyone's so impressed when a constructive proof comes along for
which previously there was only an existence proof.

Also, you have abused our common friend, logic.  You assert that since
most problems that have easy existence proofs have easy constructive proofs 
(itself not true, but let's just pretend for the moment), that THIS particular
problem has the same properties.  What be this?  Universality of property for
mathematics?  Since you have no meta-proof, why are you stating this.  I 
understand that it's en vogue to make such statements in the physical sciences,
and maybe it even makes sense to wonder about it, but two things stand in your
way: 1) you're wrong about constructive/existence 2) you have made no case for
your statements about the ENTIRE field of computational mathematics.

I don't think that this is true.  If anyone would like to point me to a paper
to show me how to exploit this, I'm all eyes, but as far as I can see, you
can't exloit known plaintext (except that you know it, he he).

Also, just to prolong this pedantry, (god I love alliteration), you don't
have a randomly chosen IDEA key.

I am having an argument with a person who thinks he has discovered a new and
brilliant encryption method....it looks seriously flawed to me, and I am
pretty ruse it is not new, but I would like some comments.

Basically the idea is that the key is the seed in a pseudo-random number
benerator, which outputs a string of bits, guaranteed not to repeat
for a much longer period than the maximum size of messages that can be
encrypted.   The message is then just XORed with this string.  He also says
he can get 2^64 different bit streams, depending on the initial key.  

Now, as far as I can see...if the same key is used only once, this basically
boils down to the problem of securely transporting the key, right ?  Even if
somebody had the algorithm and an encrypted message, there is no feasible way
to attempt decryption....

However, the major problem that I see is that he doen't agree with me that it
would be necessary to use each key only once.   Now, assuming one got two
messages, which had been XORed with the same key, knowing something like that
both contained ASCII text, it seems to me (if the messages are long enough)
that it should be possible to break this...xoring the two messages together
would eliminate the key, and frequency analysis of the result might go a long
way towards retrieving the original messages.....or am I missing something ?

Yes, they were necessary because there are simply TOO MANY people who
know nothing about this subject who are now making pronouncements
about it.

When you make ridiculous remarks in a *public* forum about a subject in which
you haven't even bothered to read the rudiments, such remarks are called
for.

If you are going to make ignorant statements without bothering to do
ANY studying of your subject matter, such "smartass" answers should
be expected.

There is a little saying: RTFM.

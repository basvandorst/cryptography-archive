I would have a problem peculiar to myself in getting my own identity 
accepted by such an authority.  Essentially, none of my official 
documentation has my "real" name on it.  

Nothing sinister here, it is just that I am universally known by my 
third given name, Iolo, rather than my first, except on official 
documents.  Some official documents even omit the name by which I am 
actually known because they only have room for two given names and a 
surname.  In order to have a key approved by an official body, supported 
by identity documents, I would have to adopt a name on my key by which I 
am not known to my closest associates or public.

This causes me some small difficulties in real life, which are 
compensated for by the trouble it gives the authorities.  I can 
generally tell whether a caller is an official from the first few words 
he says, and any official who tries to quiz an aquaintance about me is 
met with incomprehension.

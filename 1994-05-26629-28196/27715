I'm unschooled in these waters ;-) but I recommend:

Primes and Programming by Peter Giblin [Cambridge University press, 1993]
ISBN 0 521 40182 8 hardback
ISBN 0 521 40988 8 paperback

... for those interested in the number theory behind cryptography. There's
a good chapter on RSA as well as plenty of exercises in generating primes,
testing for primality, and factoring.

That is about as inaccurate a characterization of his message as I've seen.
it was an arrogant and abrasive response to a legitimate question, which
presented a calulcation in terms not useful given the way the question was
framed, and then told me to go figure it out for myself.

I've had e-mail from some who respect Silverman's knowledge but also
characterize his messages as arrogant and abrasive.

Had he said 'look, I'd like to help out but this is as far as I can get with
your assumptions--can you provide additional information of the following
kind so I can go further' he would have done what you assert. Instead he
used language that was as far from carrying a helpful expressed intent
(whatever was in his head) as the finger of contumely (as Zero Mostel
pricelessly put it in "A Funny Thing Happened On The Way to the Forum") is
from a hug.

If my response seemed to reflect harshness, I have to say that he brought it
on himself.

What nonsense! I defined a problem as precisely as I could, because the
prior traffic had said one needed some specific assumptions of the sort I
tried to provide before a useful analysis of the RSA-129 practical
implications could be made. A practical analysis produces results in terms
of how good one's key is for how long, for various key lengths, under
various hardware and related assumptions, not stuff about how X is a 3 times
more difficult factoring problem than Y.

I made no demands--I made a request to the general expert readership. It was
he who barreled in with a non-responsive, insulting reply.

>Why don't you do the analysis yourself?  

What?! Readers should refrain from asking reasonable questions because
Silverman might jump in and get arrogant and abrasive. Give me a break.

Another distortion. I've only mentioned particular experience in response to
challenges which suggest I have none, or in response to assertions from an
inappropriate knowledge base, in which I cite the more appropriate knowledge
base. I don't go around throwing my credentials in the air gratuitously. If I did, I
would have told Silverman in response to his "Mr. Sternlight" game that it's
Dr. Sternlight.

Nope. I'm a reasonable participant in a net newsgroup, asking the general
expert membership a reasonable question which may be voluntarily answered,
or not, at their convenience. Silverman's behavior and your
characterizations sound as if you or he believe this is HIS special
newsgroup and others must pay court to him. I think not.

I've read the literature relevant to my inquiry, both by Rivest and in
Schneier. Neither answers my question in the light of current developments,
and since there's been a very active RSA-129 discussion thread here, it's
perfectly proper to ask what I did. 

Unless one is a student in a particular field, it's acceptable to ask
questions and expect answers, not homework assignments, or hadn't you
noticed.

It is true that I am not familiar with Ripem.  I get the impression from 
your advice above that it does not suffer from the ITAR export 
restrictions, or you would not expect a law abiding foreign national to 
be familiar with it.  Is this the case?  Or am I in the very unusual 
position of being castigated by David Sternlight for *not* having broken 
the law.

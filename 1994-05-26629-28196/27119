Expert typographer now, are you?  I'm familiar various pieces of commercial
printing equipment between 20 and 70 years old, and I never heard of this
particular effect.  Not with typemetal, not with wood-block, not with
photo-matrices.

Ah, you mean the little toy printing kits (sold under the trade name `John
Bull' over here) where you insert little rubber characters in a wooden
carrier and ink them with a standard ink pad.  An entertaining children's
toy, but I outgrew mine when I was 6.  And even that didn't suffer from
the effects you claim.

It already is - in the UK.  I prefer the US system simply because punctuation
outside the quote is visually distracting as it appears ``disconnected''.
Logical or not, aesthetics favour doing it like ``this.''

Oh well, yet another topic where your `expertise' is sadly lacking.

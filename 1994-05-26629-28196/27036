I direct your attention to a recent Dr Dobbs Journal (Dec.93)
in which IDEA is discussed at lenth in an article by Bruce
Schnier. The algorithm is given there as well. There are also
ample sources for source code for implementing the cipher.

BTW, this exact argument can be applied to a brute force attack
on ciphers such as IDEA with equal validity.

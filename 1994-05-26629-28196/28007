I am trying to hunt down a copy of the following paper whose abstract
appeared in the Eurocrypt '89 proceedings (p. 290):

"Dining Cryptographers in the Disco: Unconditonal Sender and Recipient
 Untracability with Computationally Secure Servicability"

 by Michael Waidner and Birgit Pfitzmann

If anyone could point me to a source of the full paper I would appreciate
it...

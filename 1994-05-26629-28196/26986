Well, we will have to wait for the guru's to speak for the BEST answer,
but, as far as I remember readings in Kahn (Codebreakers), breaking Enigma,
and other books:
Double encryption is neophyte boob-bait.
To the professional code breaker, it isn't really any harder than a single
encryption.  Example:
 (PLAIN xor KEY1 = CRYPT1)
 (PLAIN xor KEYA xor KEYB) = CRYPT2
     This is just like the 1st case, with KEY1 == (KEYA xor KEYB) 

I think that under crypanalysis, the cracker just "sees through" the double
encryption, as he is cracking it rather then decrypting it.

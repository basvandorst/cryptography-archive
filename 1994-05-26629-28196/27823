      Pseudo-totients, "Dummy" RSA and Factoring(05/19/1994)

      A working RSA system can be constructed using not only primes
but also a combination of primes and pseudoprimes. In fact, one can
construct a functioning RSA using composite numbers. These observations
leads one to the concepts of a pseudo-totient and of a "dummy" RSA, the
modulus of which incorporates elements of another, target modulus that
one might wish to factor. One can compare this approach to factoring to
a practice in biochemistry in which a decoy cell is used to attract a
deadly virus in order to identify, isolate and destroy it!

      We have demonstrated this technique in the past for the case of a
target modulus that is also a pseudoprime or can be recognized as a factor of
some pseudoprime. Naturally, a careful RSA designer will try to avoid such
compromising cases and aim to craft his modulus as a pure (?) composite.
Let me show you how it may be possible to frustrate that effort, anyway!

      I assert that given an arbitrary product of two primes, N = P*Q,
it is possible to find a multiplier R such that the product N*R =M leads
to a pseudo-totient that satisfies the Euler Theorem for at least one
base. The multiplier R can be a prime, a product of primes or a pseudoprime.
Let me illustrate the assertion:
      N = 533 = 13*41
      R = 2413 = 19*127
      M = 128 612 9
      phi'(M) = (N-1)*(R-1) = 128 318 4
      3^phi'(M) = 1 (mod M), gcd(3,M)=1

With a pseudo-totient thus found we can proceed next to the construction
of a "dummy" RSA:
      M =128 612 9
      e = 127, gcd(e, phi'(M)) =1
      d = 909 343
      X = 123 456
      X^e = Y (mod M), Y = 463 689
      Y^d = X (mod M), X = 123 456

Thus, we have a "dummy" RSA with a full complement of parameters,e,M,d and,
of course, phi'(M). To factor N we can use the DeLaurentis algorithm (see my
earlier posting on the subject) making sure to screen the trivial factori-
zation of M into N and R.

      Do not be put off by the "toy" example given above. Crank up you
computer and verify my assertion yourself with numbers that will impress you
and/or your friends!

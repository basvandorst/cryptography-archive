You miss the crux of this discussion, I think, Bill. It's not about them
denouncing the license. It's about an ambiguous phrase in the license, the
procedure for clarifying its intent and meaning, and the relative positions
of the licensor and licensee in the matter, and any consequences of a
disagreement.

To raise a new, but relevant point to try to clarify the underlying
philosophical issue, in contract law as I understand it from the PBS series
on that topic, a contract requires a meeting of the minds. If there is no
meeting of the minds there is no contract. I believe that last sentence is
another mantra, like Peter's "a promise for a promise". Thus if RSADSI says "performance
improvements" means speedups, and a licensee says "I assert that performance
improvements mean I can change the key lengths wired in to make them longer"
then there has been no meeting of the minds.

Peter will be able to say whether that principle applies to licenses as well
as contracts. As I understand it a license is simply a special form of
contract. if so, no meeting of the minds, no license, thus any use of RSAREF
by the person claiming to be licensed but who has "interpreted" an ambiguous
term differently from RSADSI, particularly after being told he is so doing,
is infringing.

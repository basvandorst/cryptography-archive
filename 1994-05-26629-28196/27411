If they are monitoring in the USA I suspect it would violate many many
laws (like of spying). To claim that a US agency would explicitley or
implicitely allow monitoring of US citizens in the USA comes close to
accusing them of treason. ( besides the competion between agencies of
the same govt, never mind of different govts is sufficiently fierce
that  even legal cooperation is I suspect rare. For expert testimony
on this see the novels of La Carre :-)
If they are monitoring in England, what fraction of US traffic goes
through England?

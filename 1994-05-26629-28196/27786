Oh.  I forgot to mention, if the story Gunnar relates is the same one
I am thinking about, it was indeed a smart card, though it was a
matter of hours, not half an hour.  It was claimed in our local
university paper, by someone sporting an academic title, that it was
possible to get the PIN code from a smart card.  No details were
given, though.  It is interesting that my bank (Den norske Bank)
abandoned the smart card concept shortly thereafter and went back to
magstrip cards.  They denied any connection when I asked them about
it.  This was about two years ago.

This is only marginally related to cryptography, though.  Maybe
someone can suggest a better place for the discussion, if it is to
continue?  Maybe alt.security ?

: Sorry I hadn't seen this message when I posted mine, saying the same
: thing.  I tried several times, and could *not* get in.

There's a msg when you ftp to the system, that the system may not 
recognize your site as being in North America. If that happens, you have 
to leave a msg to bitsy or someone (not sure of the name) at mit. Read 
the sign-on msg.

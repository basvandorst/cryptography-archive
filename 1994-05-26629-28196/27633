There is nothing inherent in PGP's web-of-trust model that prevents
its use in a hierarchical scheme comparable to that of PEM/X.509.   
In fact, PEM/X.509 is a special case of the 'web-of-trust' - what PGP 
does is put you at the top of your own CA hierarchy.   Anyone else who
wishes to trust you in a CA role is free to do so.  PGP is also more 
general than PEM/X.509 in that it can generate extra trust from the
fact that a key may be countersigned by more than one individual.

PGP itself is quite adequate measured against PEM/X.509.  All that is 
required is the infrastructure, which is currently not in place - but 
then nor is it in place for PEM/X.509.    Plus, many people are of
the opinion that a single "super-CA" is inadequate, for the simple
reason that a single organisation trustworthy to everyone and willing
to take the role seems impossible to find.  For that reason, any
scheme that mandates just one root CA is going to have an uphill
struggle for acceptance.

Will everyone in Europe - or in the world - be expected to
take a purchase order on the say-so of RSA, Inc.?   Will
the security of everything rest on the privacy of one 
thousand or so bits (where will it be kept - the moon)?  

I don't think so.

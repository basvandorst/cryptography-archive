   So after that date those foolish enough to upgrade will find they can no
   longer send encrypted messages to thier associates overseas.  Are you Yanks
   really so keen to isolate yourselves from the rest of the world?

Relax.  No need to get upset.  Although I'm not a Yank, I believe they
are not keen to cut themselves off.  What they appear to be doing is
to be making an honest attempt to clear up a messy situation that has
caused a great deal of hassle to themselves, and quite a bit to us on
the outside.

As has been pointed out before: we may be ignorant savages in the
outer wilderness as far as the US guvmint is concerned, but we are
still perfectly capable of implementing compatible software.

There will doubtless be problems during a changeover period, but I'd
expect them to die down by the end of the year.

   So how do non-US keyservers go about this, they cant use 2.5 or 2.6 because
   of export restrictions.  What about key sharing, if you have all the US
   keyservers rejecting keys from 2.3 and earlier, and the rest of the world
   unable to use later keys, then you dont have a key sharing system anymore. 
   Great going guys, looks like you've just played straight into the hands of
   those trying to control you.

The situation is under control and the key servers will be upgraded
appropriately.  Old messages will be readable, and the free world's
PGP's will be upgraded in the usual manner.

Don't worry, be happy.

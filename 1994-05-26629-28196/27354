The KG-84 (either KG-84A or KG-84C) is a Type 1 device, not a standard.

On page 1-2 of the January 1992 issue of "Information Systems Security
-- Products and Services Catalogue" prepared by The [U.S.] National
Security Agency, one reads as follows:

"KG-84A:  General purpose encryption/decryption device, low to medium
speed, accepts asynchronous or synchronous input; protects all
classifications of digital traffic; operates in full duplex, half
duplex,
and simplex modes; exceeds 29,000 hous MTBG in office environment; uses
common electronic fill devices."

The text further provides names, addresses, and phone numbers for
four vendors of the KG-84A.

You can order a subscription to the (more than one inch thick)
catalogue
from the U.. Government Office.  The accept Mastercard or Visa orders.
Address your request to:

Superintendent of Documents
U.S. Government Printing Office
Washington, D.C.  20402

Telephone orders may be placed by calling (202) 7893-3238.

Photographs of the KG-84 have appeared in ads in (I think this is
right)
Signal, the magazine of the Armed Forces Communications and Electronics
Association.  AFCEA is listed in the Northern Virginia telephone
directory.

            Dynamic Views on Information Security in Progress

 ***ABOUT IFIP'S TECHNICAL COMMITTEE 11

 The International Federation for Information Processing was  established
 in 1960 under sponsorship of UNESCO. In 1984 the Technical Committee for
 Security and Protection in  Information  Processing  Systems,  Technical
 Committee  11, came into existence. Its aim is to increase the reliabil-
 ity and general confidence in information processing, as well as to  act
 as a forum for security managers and others professionally active in the
 field of information processing  security.  Its  scope  encompasses  the
 establishment  of  a frame of reference for security common to organiza-
 tions, professionals and the public; and the promotion of  security  and
 protection as essential parts of information processing systems.

 Eight working groups: Information  Security  Management,  Small  Systems
 Security,  Database  Security,  Network  Security, Systems Integrity and
 Control, Security Legislation, Information  Security  Education  and  IT
 Related  Crime  Investigations,  all  chaired  by seasoned international
 experts, cover a major part of the actual TC 11 workload.     ------------------------------------------------------------------


 ***ABOUT THE TENTH INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION SECURITY CONFERENCE

 This event is the Tenth in a series of conferences on information  secu-
 rity.   Something  to  celebrate.  The  organizers have compiled a truly
 exceptional, unique, and especially upgraded  conference  in  a  setting
 suitable for celebrating its Tenth birthday. Over 75 sessions will cover
 just about all aspects of information security, on a senior and advanced
 level.  The  formal  language  of SEC'94 is English. The proceedings are
 published by Elsevier North Holland in its acclaimed series.

 There are evidently some astounding  surprises  within  SEC'94.  As  key
 note's  SEC'94  will feature major players. Ten invited speakers, doubt-
 less seasoned seniors in their field, will contribute with their  vision
 of the future.  Ranging from the legislative aspects of data privacy, to
 the international impact of the Clipper chip, and the dimensions of  new
 cryptographic  standards  and  applications.  Global  policy  making and
 breaking in respect of the international harmonization efforts of infor-
 mation  technology security evaluation criteria, and other most enticing
 issues are advocated during the various invited lectures.


 Within the framework of this conference a series of special lectures are
 built in, dedicated to one most important aspect. SEC'94 includes a UNIX
 system security workshop and a cryptology tutorial. Special sessions are
 devoted  to  information security in developing nations, and information
 security in the banking and financial industry. Two major full day  mini
 conferences  "IT Security Evaluation Criteria" and "Open Systems Network
 Security" are included in the program as well.  SEC'94  offers  a  panel
 discussion  of  the editors of Elseviers Journal Computers and Security,
 IFIP TC 11's formal journal.


               IFIP TC 11's SEC'94 welcomes you to Curacao,
                                BONBINI !

That's what I actually used had you checked the math.- the 4 was a typo.

For these purposed, 1 instruction=1 math operation ( ie the difference between an
instruction and an arithmetic instruction is of order 1 ( ie probably
something like a factor of 5 at most, and nothing here is accurate to
a factor of 5- different compilers could make that much difference, )

So they are to the accuracy here they same speed (probably a
difference in compiler could have make an equally big difference).

Which is close enough to 129 for all of the discussion here.

Oh come on, the only thing of importance is c+o(1) If you want me to
be that pedantic, c+o(1)=1.91 Ie, o(1)=0.

 Will do. 

Anyway thank you for your response. It is at least an attempt to
inject some modicum of facts into the discussion.

I have not tracked down this paper (perhaps someone could), but the only
low-exponent attack I am familiar with applies if the same message is
RSA-encrypted to something like 2e recipients, where e is the encryption
exponent.

In typical applications, this never happens.  For example, when PGP sends
a message to multiple recipients, 18 bytes (144 bits) of the input to
the RSA computation is the same for all recipients (the IDEA key used
to encrypt the data plus two bytes of framing), but the remaining bits
(at least 140, for 384-bit moduli) of random padding are generated
differently for each recipient.  Thus, the message which is fed to the
RSA algorithm is substantially different for each recipient, so the
attack does not apply.

Hi Folks,

I have been looking at the Outerbridge DES implementation, and would
like to better understand how some of the speedups work.  Maybe I'm
getting old, or perhaps I look at it too late at night, but I could
certainly do with a pointer to any articles or papers which describe
the algorithm for the speedup.

If you know the reference off hand, could you please email it to me -
it would save me a day in the library.  Thanks!

Cheers, Dieter.

	All this talk about sternlight has given me an idea. Why don't we 
find out if he's really human and run the Turing test on him? It will at 
least tell us whether he is a human. I need a copy of the procedures used 
to administer the Turing test, and sternlight on IRC for a couple of 
hours. I long since killfiled sternlicker, so sternlight, respond to me 
in e-mail. Come on Sternlight - take the test - prove that you are human.

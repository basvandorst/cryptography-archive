I agree with you. Suppose we have N=p*q, e, d with e*d=1 mod (p-1)(q-1).
The public key is N,e; the private key is d. Encryption is by c=m^e mod N,
where m is a block of plain text, c is the cipher text. Decryption is
by m=c^d mod N. The usual attack is to factor N to get p and q, hence
get d.

It has been shown that if one has d, then one can get p and q. But one
might also proceed directly to extract e-th roots mod N. As far
as I know this has not been shown to lead to a knowledge of d. Remember
that e is often small in practice (eg 3).

This is confirmed by the RSA FAQ (prepared by RSA Laboratories) recently
posted to sci.crypt and alt.security.ripem.

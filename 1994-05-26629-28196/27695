Under the license that will presumably come with it, PGP 2.6 will not
be allowed for commerical use.  However, this licence is just the
default license.  Could ViaCrypt not negotiate a special license with
MIT, PKP, and any others with interest in the PGP 2.6 code to take
it and sell it to commercial users?

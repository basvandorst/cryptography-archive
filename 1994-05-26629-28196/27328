The preface to the paperback edition has the following note from Kahn:

	The original publisher submitted the manuscript to the Department
	of Defense [sic] on March 4, v1966, which requested three minor
	deletions--to all of which I acceeded--before release the
	manuscript for publication.

My copy of the hardcover edition is in my office, so I can't check now
to see if the material Bamford lists as deleted has been restored.  (I
obtained my hardcover copy about 10 years ago.)

I would have picked (3) too as well as (5) except I've known Sternlite
from his days on Compuserve where he haunted the Macintosh forums
almost exclusively, pontificating pretty much as he does now.  Since
the forum content is so different it is hard to reconcile (3).

Sternlite loves waving his electronic open fly around so much that 
he was willing to pay big bucks for the privilege; when he found out
about netcom and $20 flat rates before an audience of untold millions
probably caused a local convenience store shortage of KY jelly for weeks
afterwards.

I think he's just a guy nearing the end of middle age who feels 
the importance and power he once almost had slipping away. I suspect
he is driven by fear of oblivion, but even with credentials devalued
by time he is still a loose cannon to mind.

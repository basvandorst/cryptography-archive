Not possible for me personally though, or any non-USA resident.  But if 
it were, I am not sure that official certification of what might be just 
a nickname (not in my case, but that sounds like what you are talking 
about) makes any kind of sense.  In fact, it rather devalues the process 
itself.  "This key is officially certified as that of C3\/\/L d00d."  
Hmmm.

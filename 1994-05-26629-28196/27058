	There is a simple reason: RSA is painfully slow. The best 
HARDWARE implementations only run at 600 KBits/sec for a 512 bit modulus. 
Software is many times slower. IDEA is almost as secure, or possibly more 
secure, then DES. RSA is not known to be stronger then DES or IDEA, and 
vice-versa. Plus you only have one cipher/plaintext set for each 
IDEA key, so you are reduced to an exhaustive keysearch of something 
like 2^64 possibilities.
	Summary: The single key algorithm in PGP is not a weak link.

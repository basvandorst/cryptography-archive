A computer is a physical device which if you give it an input consisiting say of a
long string of bits, it will thorugh it's natural dynamical evoluton eventually give
you an output consisting of a usually different string of bits.
By choosing the evolution carefully, those output bits could be the answer to a
problem posed by the string of input bits.
A quantum computer is a computer ( as defined above) which had the added feature
that if you feed it some superposition ( int he quantum sense ) or a bunch of inputs
at the same time, the output will consist of the superposition of the all of the
relevant output bits for each of the inputs. 
By choosing the dynamics carefully you could have those inputs which which gave the
"right " answer interfere constructively, while the "wrong" answer would interfere
destructively, so that in the end you would have a high probability of having the
"right" answer when you look at the output in the right way. 
A quantum computer MUST be a reversible computer ( current ones are say at least 7
orders of magnitude away yet), but it must be even better than that. It must
interact with it's environment in such a wa that even in principle it is not
possible to tell from any measurement on the environment which calculation the
computer was doing.  Tough job.

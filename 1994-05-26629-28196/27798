Interesting, esp since I have no evidence that Friedman&Co did
develop any general attacks....  They seemed to have used the British
methods, which depended on 'cribs'.

This is the same method the British used, kinda for the Bombe and the
Colossus machines.  But they depended more on cribs and certain known
weaknesses with the system.  Given that the is something like
403x10^30 possible rotor wirings, (26!), and a simply astronomical
number or arrangements...  Brute force attacks would seem kinda
difficult, even with modern technology.

Which, of course was the whole point of my question...

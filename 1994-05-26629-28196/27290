Correction: DES cannot (generally) be legally exported from the U.S.
If you have a copy outside the US, then whether or not it's legal to
use is a matter of your local country's laws (i.e., Japanese laws),
not U.S. export restrictions.  Since I have no idea what Japanese
laws are, I have no idea whether it's legal, for you to use DES.

:     But certainly we have it:
:        % crypt
:        Enter key:

It *may* be (hypothesizing here) that the crypt command that's in
non-US distributions is somehow less capable.  The "original" crypt
command did not use DES, but rather an Enigma algorithm.  That was
export controlled for a while; I don't know if it's been released.

: (2) When I put a command "man des", it also says "RESTRICTIONS This
:     command is only available with the U.S. Solaris Encryption kit."
:     In this case, we do not have this command:
:       % des
:       des: Command not found

That makes sense.  Sun is trying not to export in violation of the law.

: So I logged into our old SUN3 running SunOS Release 4.1, the I got
:     % crypt
:     crypt: Command not found.
:     % man crypt
:     ......
: RESTRICTIONS
:      This program is not available on  software  shipped  outside
:   the U.S.

Sounds like this falls under my hypothesized "old" version  of the
program.

: QUESTION1: Can I legally use crypt under Solaris 2.3 in Japan?

That's a question for Japanese law.  You shouldn't  make any assumptions
on this without consulting a Japanese specialist in encryption law.

: QUESTION2: If it is the case, isn't it compatible with "crypt" in U.S.?

Don't know how that's handled.

Aha!  There's the problem.  The US government in its infinite
wisdom restricts the export of products containing DES, but DES
is freely available outside the US.  Strictly speaking, US sites
should not make DES available for ftp from outside the US, lest
they be parties to breaking the export laws.

: QUESTION3: Can I legally use these programs after FTPing them?

See earlier comment.  The issue of whether you can use them is
for Japanese law.  Anyone who allows you to FTP them from the US
is violating US law, but that's probably not your problem!

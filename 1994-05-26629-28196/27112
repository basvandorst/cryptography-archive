This was exp(sqrt(ln(n) ln(ln(n)))) in the ps bitmapped image posted here

Note that in all of these cases the difficulty of a 1024 bit password is
at least  10^6 times  more difficult than the 129 digit one and that in
the first two cases ( L and A) it is at least 10^9 times more difficult.
Thus the 5000 MIPs years translate to 10^13 Mips years in the more
likely case.
 The number of operations predicted by the above formulas for 129 digits
 is L(10^129)=A(129)= 20,000 Mips years
 and H(129)= 4 Mips years.
 Using these to set the proportionality constant, and assuming that the
 first formular is right, we ge tht proportionality constant of 1/4.
 Without a change in technique and taking the A(n) as the operational 
 one, the difficulty of 308 digits vs 129 is about 10^11.

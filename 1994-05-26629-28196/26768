I recently read about an attack on MD5 (and subsequently, MD4)
produced by B. den Boer and A. Bosselaers that can produce 
pseudo-collisions (2 chaining variables and a message block that 
produce the same hash code). Aside from saying just that and that 
it only takes a few minutes on a PC, there is no more information. 
There is supposedly a paper to be presented at Eurocrypt. If anybody 
has seen it, could you please email me the location of it, as I 
would like to read it.

Thanks,
jonathan

[explanation of Enigma solving]

OK, I'll be the dumb one, and ask why couldn't the rotor settings be
determined by cryptanalysis alone, without captured machines?  I can
see how to do it for a single rotor machine like the old Unix crypt().

Consider a single rotor machine like crypt().  Now imagine a word like
"cryptography" repeated several times in the text.  You should get
a *pattern* of repeated and unrepeated letters in each instance, where
each letter corresponding to a position however is different.  That is:
   cryptography 
   abcadefgdhii
   r..rg...g.pp
   d..da...a.uu
I think Friedman calls these "isomorphs".  We guess that these strings
represent the same plaintext (we could be wrong, but then we could
be right).  We note their distance from each other, and voila, we have
partially reconstructed the single rotor.  It's a blessing if we can
guess that the plaintext is "cryptography", but it is not essential.

We use the partial reconstruction to tease more plaintext out of the
ciphertext, and this additional plaintext to add to our reconstruction.

I don't see how to extend this to more than one rotor.  But I can't
help suspecting that it could be done.  So, why couldn't it?

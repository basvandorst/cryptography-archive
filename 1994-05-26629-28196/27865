I should try clearing up some of the misconceptions that are multiplying
on sci.crypt on quantum computers.  So far, the only things quantum
computers are known to do in polynomial time that cannot be done
on regular computers are a few contrived-looking problems, factoring, and
discrete logarithms.  In the original mention of quantum computers,
Feynman suggested they be used for simulating quantum mechanics, and this
is probably another case they do better than regular computers.  Quantum
computers can be simulated by ordinary computers, but doing so (as far
as we know) entails an exponential factor in increased computation time,
so factoring via simulating a quantum computer will be much slower than
trial division (and you probably thought that was the slowest algorithm
possible for factoring (-: ).  Quantum computing can be accomplished by
the action of Schrodinger's equation on a (somewhat complicated)
Hamiltonian, where the number of bits of precision for needed for the 
Hamiltonian is at most logarithmic in the length of the computation, so 
it's not cheating by using exponentially many bits.

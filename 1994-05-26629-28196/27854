This argument is fine for e-mail between a few trusted friends, but those who
make it forget that it is totally inappropriate for authenticating messages
to public newsgroups. Yet the latter is one of the major purposes of public
key crypto, and is the most common visible use here. In effect, all those
signatures on PGP posts to newsgroups ar worthless unless a reader also
happens to know and trust one of your key signers, not the usual case.

To get PGP to be useful for this purpose, it needs to adopt something like
the PEM certificate heirarchy.

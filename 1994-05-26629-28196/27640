   In fact, I'm a little mystified that no-one in Europe has announced a
   new FTP site for PGP 2.5.  Since it's freeware, no *European* law will
   have been broken, and while a US law will have been broken it will be
   utterly impossible to tell by whom.  Am I right?

Not correct - RSAREF is copyrighted, and the Berne Convention countries 
(i.e. U.S., most or all of Europe, etc.) will honor their copyrights.
So we need to get some non-North-American to write an RSAREF 2.0 lookalike.
Any volunteers?

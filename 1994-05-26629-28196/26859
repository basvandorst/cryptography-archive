ARPA's budget is tiny now compared to its heyday, when it could throw money
at just about any worthwhile project.

In 1960 the government had lots of money to spend on the space program and
the DOD, as part of the Cold War competition with and defense against
Russia.  The government doesn't have such deep pockets these days, and
we're no longer as paranoid as we were then.  I doubt that the CIA has been
immune from government cutbacks (but the details of its budget are probably
secret).

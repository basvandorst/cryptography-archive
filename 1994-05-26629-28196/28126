A paper can NEVER infringe on a patent. An explicit purpose of the
patent system is to encourage innovation and development. There is
a difference between a patent and a trade secret.

Use of the method outlined in the paper may infringe, but only if
the courts say that it does. Given the current state of software and
algorithmic patents, I don't think anybody can reliably predict
how the courts will decide.

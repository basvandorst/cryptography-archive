Forwarding a question from LAWSIG on CompuServe --

Is the an implementation of DES available in Europe.  The original poster
wants to sell a program which would use encryption to preserve the security
of (I believe medical) data, and wants the program to work in the US and in
Europe.  I suggested a drop-in DES module, and US customers would use his
copy, and European customers would use a separately available copy in
Europe.

His name, in case you want to write him directly, is:

Silvio Kuczynski
Tropical Software

Remember, though it costs him to read Internet mail, so he would probably
prefer that you give me the information and I'll forward it to him through
my CIS account.  (I didn't ask him that, though, because I thought I
already had the information.)

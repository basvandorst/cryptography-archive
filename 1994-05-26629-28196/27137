I thought that Ben Tilly, by drawing this analogy, made his point very
well, without nastiness of any kind. The only problem is that the analogy
seems slightly flawed. It should be:

Give David Sternlight a fish, and he'll whine that it isn't big enough.
Teach him to fish, and he'll invite himself to your house for dinner and
then bitch about the quality of the food that he gets.

I doubt that you're keeping score, but here is a contrary opinion:  the
responses that you have received have told you what was wrong with your
question, how it could be fixed, and how to find the answer.  They have
also been much more polite than you deserve.

Not really.  The NSA spot Sterno spouting crap, note his previous govt
job, and ask him to do a little favour.  Or maybe they arranged for some
old govt contact he wouldn't suspect to tickle his interest in crypto and
then let nature take its course.  He's so clueless about so many subjects -
why would he know he was being manipulated by the NSA?

They'd have to invent new miracle washing powders to get the stains out
of his underwear...

It's the most probable explanation.  But it's still possible that he's an
unsuspecting pawn of the NSA...

Or possibly a petard - almost as likely to destroy its operator as get the
job done.

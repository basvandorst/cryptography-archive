I maintain a WWW server with an archive of cryptography information. While
talking to someone over the net, I realized that it might be beneficial
to everyone for there to be some information there on everyone's favorite
government apologist, David Sternlight.

If anybody has some quality stuff about him (a picture would be great, or
maybe a FAQ list from alt.fan.dave-sternlight), I would appreciate your
forwarding them to me.

If you want to take a look at my crypto archive, point your Web browser
at:

Isn't this the same as saying that using "the right quantum-mechanical
principles", you could build a machine with the same power as an NDTM
(non-deterministic Turing machine) by forking off into different
eigenstates at each decision point and uniting again at the end in such
a way that any accepting eigenstate is found?

And if that's possible, cryptography isn't.

I wish I knew enough QM to understand what makes building such a
machine difficult...

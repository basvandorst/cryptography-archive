=What's the problem?  Sounds to me like he was using definition #2.  It says
="excessive *or* irrational", not "excessive *and* irrational".  I think when
=DS wrote, "I don't say unjustified", he eliminated the "or irrational" phrase.
=Now read it again: "a tendency on the part of individuals or groups toward

=DS is saying that some members of the PGP crowd are more suspicious than most

=some slack.

It does sound that way, and if almost anyone else had said it, I
wouldn't have bothered to post, but we are treated regularly to
lectures on conduct and literacy from David, and I feel that he should
provide us with a shining example to follow (He has indeed posted which
dictionary he uses).

From the same dictionary as my previous definition, which
seems to be Webster's 9th, or a variant:  "exceeding the usual, proper,
or normal ...  EXCESSIVE implies an amount or degree too great to be
reasonable or acceptable;"

It's a nit, but "justified paranoia" makes little sense:  by definition,
paranoia is unjustified -- that's what makes it paranoia rather than
caution.  

David's shown us sinuousities in his use of language: if his point was
ironic, I felt it should be highlighted: "I don't say that nothing
drove them 'round the bend, poor dears, but now they are paranoid".
More likely, his point was merely to avoid giving his opponents grounds
for saying "oh, give it a break David -- we're not nuts!":  "I don't
say many of PGP's fans are actually insane, merely suffering from a
psychosis".

However, the definition doesn't really support the idea that one can be
"justifiably paranoid", and I think David, who lectures us upon his wide
experience and our inferior conduct, really ought to be more precise --
at least, if he's going to set an example.

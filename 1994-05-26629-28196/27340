Crypto products are classified into one of four categories, with different
qualifications, export restrictions, and design.

Type 1 - classified algorithm endorsed by NSA for protecting classified
	and sensitive information (no export).
Type 2 - algorithm approved by NSA for protecting classified and
	sensitive information (no export).
Type 3 - algorithm registered by NIST and published as a FIPS for protecting
	unclassified sensitive information or commercial information (possible
	export restrictions).  DES is Type 3 crypto.
Type 4 - algorithm registered by NIST for protecting commercial information.
	Not a FIPS, but still may be export restricted.  RSA is an example
	of Type 4 crypto.

I hope this helps.

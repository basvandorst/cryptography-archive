There is still another angle to teh question that you have posed. If you
have a reason to suspect that safe primes are used then the value of phi(N)
can be used directly to factor N. I had a posting on the subject but got
little response. Anyway, this is what you do:
	phi(N) = 4*p*q
wher p,q are the Sophie Germain primes.
Thei sum is
 
Ignore the receding line. I typed too many characters.
	p + q = (N-(phi(N)+1)/2
Values of p,q can be obtained from a solution to a quadratic equation
since the expression ((p+q)^2+phi(n) is a perfect square.
Note that
	N = 2*p+1)*(2*q+1)
Excuse my typing. I am improvising this text.

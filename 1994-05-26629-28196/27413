I've been chomping at the bit to add some of the hard evidence on this topic
based on history, but wasn't sure if Harvest had been revealed. Since
there's an exhibit in the NSA museum about this according to Olin Sibert's
just posted visit report, let me cite it as a pointer in support of my
position on the matter.

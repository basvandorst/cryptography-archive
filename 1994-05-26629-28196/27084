   The DOS memory modell wouldn't be the problem since a real try would
   use some kind of DOS extender (probably DJGPP, a DOS port of GCC). If
   you use a 32-bit DOS-extender as DJPGG you get flat address support,
   virtual memory support and even support for most UN*X c functions.

The ppmpqs siever works well under DJGPP.  I've done it on a 4Mb 386
as an exercise.  It needed a little work to strip out the multiple
process code (system("...") mostly) but nothing too hard.
Unfortunately, the RSA129 computations needed at least 6.5Mb to work
at all and over 10Mb to run at a reasonable speed.

   There are a lot of 8 Mb (or more) PC's out there that do nothing each
   night. The program would probably have to be modified a little
   (exiting when someone pressed a key and such), but it would probably
   be doable. The main problem is to get the results back...

Au contraire!  Several participants in the RSA-129 projects ran
sneakernet to get the results in to us.  My officemate, for instance,
ran a sneakernet between his home Linux box and our office ethernetted
DECstations.  Agreed, it is not so convenient as having the relations
emailed in automagically, but the data rate is so low that a diskette
will hold a few *weeks* output from a typical PC.

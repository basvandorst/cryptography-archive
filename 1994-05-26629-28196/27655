Well, are you talking about crypt(1) included in UNIX OS ?  Yes,
it is restricted to export to other countrie but I'm sure you
can find it from some ftp-sites.  But, why do you want it ?  It's
just a toy program and *CANNOT* protect your private documents
AT ALL.  Some even claim they can decrypt that so-called "encryption"
within a matter of minutes.  So, still want it ?

PGP is not compatible with crypt(1).  I'm sure I'll drop my PGP
program if I find out they are in fact the same one day ;)

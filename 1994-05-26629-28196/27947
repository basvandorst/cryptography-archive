O.K. You've convinced me that the "meeting of the minds" notion with respect
to contracts isn't operationally useful, and that a license is certainly not
a contract.

I guess that leaves us with the issue of what an expert witness would say
"performance improvement" means in the context of the RSAREF agreement,
and that certainly won't get resolved except in court if the hypothetical
occurs and the parties go down the litigous path. Even in court, if life
imitates art, there will be enough expert witnesses available to testify on
both sides of "performance improvement IS making keys longer" "it's not"
to throroughly confuse a tryer of fact and perhaps end up in a "draw" (which
I assume means the defendant prevails).

My conclusion from this wonderful mini seminar (thanks again, Peter) is that
either RSADSI drafted to leave a deliberate loophole because they weren't
worried about such "improvements", or that they were careless and should
either have spelled out "performance improvements" or required all changes
to the code to have prior written permission.

Finally, I can't resist:

What is the sound of one mind meeting?

(Although I wrote the above as a joke, it turns out to work well in the
tradition of Zen koans, even on brief inspection.)

Thanks for sharing your knowledge;
David

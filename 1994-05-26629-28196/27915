Let me suggest that folks who think that sheer computing horsepower
will solve all those old cipher systems read Carl Ellison's ``A Solution
of the Hebern Machine'', Cryptologia 12:3, pp 144-158, reprinted in
``Cryptology:  Machines, History, Methods'', ed. Deavours, Kahn, Kruh,
Mellen, Winkel, Artech House, 1989.

A couple of quotes will summarize what I'm saying:

	The temptation, here, was to proceed with a solution based,
	roughly, on the thought: ``Friedman and Rejewski may have been
	brilliant, but we have comptuers now and don't have to be
	brilliant''.  The result was that each successful step in the
	solution was preceded by the waste of many hours and many computer
	cycles, waiting for the modern, computer scientist's algorithm to
	get nowhere.  Each re-derivation came as part of a need to go back
	to the drawing board after such failures

	The computer did help.  However, it also hindered, by seduction
	away from mathematics.

	....


	At the current, exponential rate of growth of power and
	sophistication, it may be only a few decades before we can match
	what Friedman or Rejewski did with pencil and paper or what Turing
	and Welchman did with a spool of wire and a soldering iron.

There are only two things that I worry about with respect to 4096-bit keys:

1) A very fast algorithm will be found for cracking RSA--one that scales
with key size much more gently than the best now known.  The likelihood of
this seems rather remote--but it is possible.

2) Nanocomputers--the size of a cell with SPECint numbers 10^9 better than
our best computers of 1994.  But of course such computing power would also
lengthen the largest practical key lengths, easily overcompensating for
the increased cracking power.  Except that only the government may have
access to nanocomputers at first...and for who knows how long...  But it does
seem that by the time nanocomputers become available, key lengths using the
then-standard commercially available CPUs should be long enough to withstand
even nanocomputer attack.  And a governemnt with exclusive control of
nanotechnology is an even worse problem than one with an over-eager NSA.

To what are you referring?  I usually don't miss things like this. Sounds 
interesting!

Just because your'e paranoid, doesn't mean they aren't after you...

But seriously, I think your fear is excessive.

I didn't say 4096-bit keys were "unassailably safe."  I said they "appear 
unimpeachably safe."  They "appear" safe--unimpeachably--because no one can 
prove they are not safe.  To be "unassailably safe," there would need to be a 
proof that they are in fact safe.  Such proof does not exist.  Yet.

On the other hand, a better statement would be that 4096-bit keys are not
provably unsafe.  That magical factoring algorithm just might be revealed
as an aside at some mathematician's conference as a side-effect of a one-page
proof of Fermat's last theorem or somesuch.  You just never know.

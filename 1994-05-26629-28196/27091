Have you difficulty in distinguishing between "writing from" and "being
from"?

I have been on a campaign for 40 years now to get the comma/double-quote
convention made logical. It is a hangover from the old days where if you put
the punctation outside the quote the ink would smear. We haven't had
equipment like that for many, many years. There are a few others who are
trying to do the same. If enough use the punctuation "properly"--inside the
quotes when part of the quotes, outside when part of the sentence containing
the quotes--maybe it will become acceptable usage.

Judging from your messages, if anyone can benefit from Strunk and White, it
is you, not I.

Because I care a lot about CPSR. They've done very good work in the past and
are likely to do so in future, and when I see the kind of what I think to be
abuse of CPSR's reputation with an unprofessional propaganda campaign, I'm
motivated to discuss it.

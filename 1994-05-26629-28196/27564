I'm looking for info on design and construction of RNGs using several 
oscillators. I've heard of this, but am not sure exactly the theory 
behind them, and would like to build one to test.
 Where can I find papers (preferably available on the net) on this 
subject? Or if anyone with knowledge could briefly summarize: how many 
oscillators, what speed they run, how fast to sample, etc., I'd really 
appreciate it.

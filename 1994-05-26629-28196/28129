The cleartext, constant string, is a 64 bit wide zero on 
all versions of UNIX.  The system calculates a "salt" 
based on factors such as the system clock.  The salt 
is then used to perbuterb the encryption in one of
4096 ways.  The password field in /etc/passwd contains
the salt as the first two characters and the ciphertext
as the remaining characters.

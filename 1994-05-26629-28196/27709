Please excuse me if what I'm about to say is off-topic - I'm coming into
the discussion late.

As I understand it, the threat here is that a 'quantum computer' would be
so immensely fast that current cryptographic methods would fall to
brute-force attacks. Would it not be equally true that by, for example,
extending (doubling?) the key length used with current methods, the threat
would be set back to current levels?

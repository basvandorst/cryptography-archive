The RSA-FAQ list is contradictory about this. See section 4.7 (What are the 
prospects for theoretical factoring breakthroughs?):

---quote-------
...
Another possibility is that someone will prove that factoring is difficult.
This negative breakthrough is probably more likely than the positive 
breakthrough discussed above, but would also be unexpected at the current 
state of theoretical factoring research. This development would guarantee 
the security of RSA beyond a certain key size.
...
---end quote---

This would imply that the existence of an efficient algorithm for breaking 
RSA implies the existence of an efficient factoring algorithm 
(even eff. factoring of any numbers, not just N=p*q). I don't think this 
is known to be true. I wrote to the 
editors of the FAQ list about this some time ago, but the text remained 
unchanged. Am I missing something? If someone thinks the last sentence 
of the quoted statement is true, I would appreciate any pointers to 
literature confirming this.

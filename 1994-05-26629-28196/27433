Thanks. I agree that Fort Meade most likely has some special
number-crunching machines...even in the days of Harvest, a bit part of
the power was not the Stretch CPU itself, but special-purpose hardware
built especially for the task at hand. (Which in Harvest's case was
crunching international telegraphy intercepts, Telex messages, and the
like.)

I did a calculation a few months back (on the Cypherpunks list) about
the capabilites (a la Wiener's DES-busters) if the same budget used
for Harvest were applied to DES-busters. $100 million in today's
dollars would break a DES key in a handful of minutes.

Actually, $100 million is comparatively cheap, given that SIGINT
satellites routinely cost $1.5 billion and singel Space Shuttle flight
is estimated by GAO to cost this. Given that NSA has their own wafer
fab for producing custom chips (built for them by National
Semiconductor), my surmisal is that such special code-busting engines
exist. (Fortunately for those of us who don't want the guys at Fort
Meade to read our messages, IDEA is stronger, and so is 3DES.)

However, as regard RSA itself. The recent work on RSA-129 involves a
384-bit key, of course. A 1024 bit key should be 10^12 times harder to
break. I doubt even NSA can muster a trillion times the power of the
the network of workstations that just spent a year factoring that one
RSA-129 modulus. It'll be safe for the next 50 or more years, even at
the current Moore's Law rate of processor speedup (and parallelism).

And of course 1200-bit keys are easy enough to use. Or 1500-bit keys,
or even 3000-bit keys. (The key generation time goes up, but is still
easily within the reach of modern PCs.) 

The math of public keys tells it all: encryption is always cheap
compared to factoring the modulus...bigger keys only make the
difference greater.

Encryption always wins.

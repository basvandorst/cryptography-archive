        I'm sorry, but I can't let this pass.  This is a great
        example of the awesome Amerocentric view of so many people in
        the States;  automatically assuming that if there arrived [in
        the United States] 'a mandated crypto standard', that 'every
        zip on Internet of PGP or other crypto software' [in the
        world] could disappear overnight, is just the purest
        nonsense.

        The Internet does not stop at the borders (or boards) of the
        USA.  PGP exists on ftp repositories, archive sites, mirror
        sites, bulletin boards, etc, ALL OVER THE PLANET.  What the
        American government choose to 'allow' the American people to
        do is of very little concern to the rest of us.

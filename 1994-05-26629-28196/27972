	I believe there was a way they developed that they could use to 
deduce the wiring pattern of the first rotor in the sequence, and another 
to deduce the pattern of the reflector, once you knew the patterns of all 
the rotors. Since there were only 3 rotors in at a time, 
out of a total of 5(?), I believe, once you got the wiring patterns of 
all the rotors (not difficult because they rotated the rotors from day to 
day). You could figure the keys, because it was standard practice for the 
operator to first encipher unique, randomly chosen rotor settings twice, 
with the daily key. Therefore, you had two three-letter sequences of 
plaintext that you knew where identical. That would allow you to deduce 
the plug positions used, and the daily key. 
	This was all published in Cryptologia a while back - I'm not sure 
because I found the article in a collection of articles from the first 
ten years of publication - I believe the book was called: Cryptology: 
Machines, History, and Methods. It was edited by a number of luminaries 
in the field, but the only name I can remember is David Kahn.

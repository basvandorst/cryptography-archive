Possible reasons for Sternlight's behaviour:

1) Alzheimer's.  That would explain the short attention span and the
   `forgetfulness'.

2) Schizophrenia.  That would explain the wildly different response where
   he flames someone for insulting him, then in his next post commits the
   same offence himself.

3) NSA shill.  This explains why most of his posts are flame-bait - they're
   designed to divert attention from important issues.  Also, if people
   killfile any posting which responds to his idiocies (many people do this)
   then he can effectively cut a thread short simply by posting.

4) A shit-stirrer.  He's old enough that he ought to have outgrown this
   sort of infantile behaviour, but maybe he gets his jollies by winding
   people up.

5) He's a complete and utter fuckwit.  A moron with delusions of grandeur.

Fortunately, it doesn't really matter what the real explanation is.  Just
post some offensive vitriol in his direction and he'll claim to put you
in his killfile - if enough of us do it we can keep most threads
uncontaminated.

Unfortunately, David lies about putting you in his killfile, and after a few
weeks or months he either forgets or can't resist responding, so you have to
occasionally post some more vitriol just so he can say he's including you
in his killfile again.

BTW, my own preference is for (3) or (5).

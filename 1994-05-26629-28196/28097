   That's a thinko -- it took them 5 days on a 486 based box.  NSA wants
   them to prove that they are as insecure as 40 bit RSA before they can
   get their export licence.  If you know how to do this, Tom Rearick of
   the Lotus Word Processing Division may want to hear from you (he's at
   Tom_Rearick.LOTUS@CRD.lotus.com).

Do you *really* mean 40-bit RSA?  RSA encryption with a 40-bit key?

2^40 is 1099511627776, or a little over 10^12.  Numbers that small are
just about within range of pencil and paper attacks.

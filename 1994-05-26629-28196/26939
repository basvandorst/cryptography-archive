   I'm a little confused.  The Sun 3/50 was sold in two models 2M and
4M with the idicated amount of RAM, and AFAIK no way to add more.
(The MIPS rating seems right.)  Was this a 4 Meg machine, or did it
have an aftermarket memory upgrade?

   But just to reconfirm what you and Bob have been saying, memory
bandwidths have been growing much slower than processor speeds.  For
MPQS, memory write speed is crucial (in particular read-modify-write
sequences), and data caches are almost useless.  (Instruction caches
help a lot--they mean that all the bus bandwidth can be devoted to the
data fetches and stores.)

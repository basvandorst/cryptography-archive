I REALLY do try and follow, but with the noise you generate it aint easy.

So, someone asked everyone who mailed CPSR to mail YOU.  Once your name
appears in a post, a good KILL file would drop that post.  Those with
KILL files that don't catch it will see that it was about you anyway
and grumble as they hit the "n" key.  Anyone that has gone to the
trouble of KILL filing you aint gonna send you personal email to
convince you that they voted.  Most hope you just go away.

The CPSR post spread like wildfire.  I don't know why you think it
went in "stages".  Like everyone who saw the article in one group
would hold onto it for a week, then forward it after waiting some
amount of time.  There are surely propagation delays, which means
several people would see the article in the first group and NOT
see it in another group and several people would then forward it
to the new group.

The call for sending articles to you never went far, except to places
like cypherpunks where you were thoroughly ridiculed.  I NEVER saw
the original call for email to you, nor do I know who the bystander
was that requested them to mail you.  Groups that have "animated"
discussion also have a lot of noise and not many people read everything
in them.

"...wasn't clear that the signature were all genuine" indeed!  You said,
repeated, and continue to repeat that CPSR was hoaxed.  I'll give
you the benefit of the doubt and assume that you actually THINK that
people see you as just a concerned bystander, but I have a sense that
most people in the groups you frequent are aware that you support
Clipper and do NOT see you as neutral third party but as an opponent
of CPSR.  Inflamatory accusations like "CPSR was hoaxed" give many
of us the impression that you are out to get them.

It might be "tempting" to "show you" that CPSR wasn't hoaxed, but most of
us really don't care about you.  We suspect that you would have lied about
your responses.  You mentioned various methods that you would apply
to the data you did get, but you were secretive about WHAT you would
do with it.  I do undertstand that social scientists should not
tell the subjects how they will be measured for fear of changing
the outcome, but when the experimenter is so obviously biased you
will get the same kind of distorting effect from respondents.  I'm sure
many assumed you had some silly statistical analysis program that would
"prove" CPSR was hoaxed.  Most people who read your posts know that you
will never be convinced.  For the life of me, I can't figure out
why I'm still responding to you.

My question was, IF they flooded CPSR, why didn't they flood you?

Motives aside, your accusations have mostly been aimed at the CPSR
folks for not being professional and ignoring you (good for them).
Even after EPIC was formed, you used it as a stump for further CPSR
slandering.

And your ONLY evidence of this is that only 30 people took YOU seriously.

Duh.  How many do you believe they actually got?  Based on the 30 you got?
Taking into consideration the TIME poll that showed 80% oppose Clipper?

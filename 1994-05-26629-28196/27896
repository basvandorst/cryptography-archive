]In this case, though, Peter, aren't you omitting two material facts:

He covers this- ie the requirements of the license on the licensee are a
consideration, he claims as I read it.

So what? How does this change anything? It did not have to issue the
license. It did. Thereafter it is bound by its own license. Once it
issued the license it voluntarily gave up the right to behave as though
the license did not exist (including the right to make the terms thereof
mean whatever they wanted them to mean). In fact the only defnsxe the
patent holder might have is that the licensor did not have the right to
issue the license.

Most of the algorithms and protocols used by Motorola seure communications
products are kept secret, although I don't know about this particular case.

It looks like a 71-bit key, which is pretty decent.  Assuming it's a strong
cipher.  (Funny key length, though.)  Maybe 72 bits, with a complementation
property that takes it down to 71?  Of course, Michael Wiener showed
that 2.5 million times faster key-searching is possible, which takes the
time to break (for about $1,000,000 in capital investment) down to
3 years.

It's a great idea, Rick, and your conclusion is 100% correct.

Um, just how much money are you planning to budget for storing this
database?  Simply listing prime numbers is quickly going to fill
up the disk on your computer.  Your 420MB drive on your PC will be
full before you get to the 20 millionth prime (seat of the pants
calculation).  Then where are you going to store the 200 trillion
pairwise products of just those 20 million?

The factors of RSA-129 are probably out around the (10**50)th prime
-- far beyond the 20 million you have listed on your PC.

Actually the licensee is generaly considered to have an "enhanced position"
since instruments--including licenses--are as a general rule to be construed
against the interest of the parties who drafted them; thus any ambiguities
in the RSA license would probably be construed against RSA by a court.  This
rule of construction is, however, like all "rules" of construction, a very 
subjective--and not very rule-like--matter.

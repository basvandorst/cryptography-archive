 I mostly agree with the first part; the question now is:  "To what
 extent does the cryptosystem demand such verification?"

 Absent such a demand, to what extent does manual verification
 occur?  Can we expect ordinary users to understand what it means
 to use unverified public keys?

 Verification *is* a cryptographic question:  Without verification,
 there is no cryptographic relationship, despite the use of public-
 key technology.

 With regard to the "trusted key signature," note that even if we
 trust the final provider, there may be an informant who has
 inserted a false key somewhere up the line.  This would be a
 "single point failure" which I would call an unacceptable risk.

 I disagree.

 I think the real question is:  "Could my messages be read by an
 intermediate spoofer as well as the intended recipient?"  If so,
 I would say that the cryptosystem has not done a very good job.

 Black and white.

 Clearly, an informant gets to be an effective informant to the
 extent s/he is trusted by the sheep.  All that is necessary is to
 be an "early," "well known" or "intimidated" personage, and you
 can sweep up vast numbers of believing users with your perfidy.

 I find it hard to believe that any cryptosystem based on third-
 party human "trust" could possibly be called a cryptosystem.  Just
 how much money or intimidation would it take to "turn" a normal
 net-person?  How does this compare with the investment and time
 needed to attack a key?

 On the other hand, the relationship between me and the intended
 recipient is not simply an empty "trust" if the cryptosystem is
 secure:  If secret information gets out, we will *both* know who
 is responsible.  This is about all we can expect from a secret,
 but can we even say this if we have a weak cryptosystem?

 I think that a public-key cryptosystem should have a true
 cryptographic protocol for key validation.  Absent that, it should
 force at least a minimal manual validation before using any public
 key, or state that it only becomes a serious cryptosystem when used
 by crypto-trained operators.

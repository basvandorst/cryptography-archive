actually, I agree with some of the things you've said on la.eats. a more
accurate phrasing of the statement in question might be 'the vast majority
of the posters on these newsgroups express disagreement with david sternlight's
positions on most issues'. I imagine (please correct me if I am wrong) that
you are here proposing that posters on usenet are unrepresentative of the
american public. is this another one of those 'silent majority' things?

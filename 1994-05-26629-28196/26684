Summary: Need help checking my DES routines
Keywords: DES
X-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.2 PL1]

: I am implementing DES.  I am having a problem.  Since you read
:in data in a block of 8 characters (64 bits), what
: do you do when you get to the end of the file and you have less
:than 8 characters to read in?

I wrote some DES code myself, and I am having problems verifing its
correct functioning.  I verified all the subroutines to the best
of my abilities but I am still not getting the same output from
my routines as I get from the SUN routines.  I am guessing that
this is due to a difference in how I define the bit numbers.
So here is my question.  Given say 8 bytes in memory, starting at
say location 0 and ending at location 7 is there a prefered way
to define where bit 1 is and so on?

Can someone give me, say a dozen key, input, output
triplets for DES so that I can check my implementation?

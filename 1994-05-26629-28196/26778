So pulling several remarks in this thread together, each processor in
a CM-5 is adequate to handle one thread of MPQS, and it seems
reasonable to assume that a 16K-processor CM5 is available to the
government now.  A 64Kp CM5 (or whatever comes next in the family
line) could conceivably become available within the 5-year projected
"safe" lifetime of a 1024-bit RSA key, especially if we saw cascading
economic motives coming out of the IRS.

Fair summary?

Close to what? 256 bits? Not for ecm it isn't. After millions
of curves, the largest factor ever found by ecm has been 42 decimal
digits. There have been 2 of them found. Ecm is not currently capable
of finding 50 digits.

However, this is irrelevent. The is simply no need or point to using
4 primes for RSA.

As writer of an occasional software review, I have to tell you that 
reviewing a product from the documentation only, or from a demo, is a 
big no-no from the journalistic integrity point of view.  Since it seems 
that I am not allowed to see the complete product, due to the absurd 
rules of your country's secret police, I am afraid that I will not be 
able to confirm your assertions about Ripem.  This will be of small 
import to our readers, since the product is available only to a small 
subset of them.

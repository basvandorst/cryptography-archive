   Hi! I just started reading this newsgroup, and got 2.5 of PGP. Is this the most
   recent version, or is that 2.6? If it is not, where can I find 2.6?

   Also, just what is the MIT Keyserver, anyway?

The most recent version in the US is PGP version 2.6, which is
available via anonymous ftp from net-dist.mit.edu:/pub/PGP

There are two keyservers at MIT, one is at
	public-key-server@pgp.ai.mit.edu,
and the second is at
	pgp-public-keys@pgp.mit.edu

Hope this helps

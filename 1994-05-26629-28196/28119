Do we have a clear definition of the complexity class (QP?) that
factoring has been found to be in?  Since, I'm told, it's suspected
that QP!=NP.  Do we know what quantum computers would be like well
enough to describe an abstract machine with the same power, and if so,
what's that machine like?

thanks in advance,

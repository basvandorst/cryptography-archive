This is not a good example of what's possible with software RSA. I've looked
at Iris and its very slow. Using the MIRACL multiprecision C libary (plug,
plug - from an ftp site near you), and also on a 486DX33, I encrypted a
32k text file with a 300 (decimal) digit key, and an exponent of 3, in 
just 13 seconds. Decryption took just under 10 minutes. 

Of course IDEA or DES would be *much* faster, and RSA should *not* be 
used in this way for bulk encryption. Also a small encrypting exponent should
only be used with extreme caution by those aware of the risks.

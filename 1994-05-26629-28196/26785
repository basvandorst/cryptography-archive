Doesn't anyone listen to what I say? The extra FPGA's are almost
useless. The algorithm is memory-bound. A shared-memory type 
architecture runs into *drastic* bus and cache contention. Each
of the gate-arrays would be fighting over the bus to memory at
almost every cycle. There would be cache contention as well.

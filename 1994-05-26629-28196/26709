David, this article is widely crossposted.  Tsk.  I realize that you were
probably just responding to someone who crossposted widely.  Oh well. 
Being a sometime follower of your postings, I am unqualified to denounce
all of your comments, but I can say that your 'bright but ill-educated'
comment is a similar tactic to what has been described by one of the
steve's -- when the whitehouse was able to discredit woodward and burnstien.

The nature of this medium is to shoot from the hip.  You yourself have
often done so.  Surely, you do not include yourself amoung the group.  Or
maybe you do.  When it is convenient, you will play the simpleton, but
when you want respect, you drag out the armour which protects you. 
Perhaps it is the dated nature of your degrees, which should be questioned.
I can't comment on the generational applicability of computer sciences. 

The field of librarianship has changed considerably from 1957.  A
librarian accustomed to working with cards and books in a small library
(likely conditions in 1957) would have difficulty dealing with life in a
large research library (likely conditions today).  Unless you make an
effort to stay current, you can get passed up pretty quickly, today even
more so.

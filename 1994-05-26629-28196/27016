This comes as very good news. A U.S.-legal version of PGP would be very
welcome. What will the downloading address be?

Will PGP 2.5 be able to interoperate with PGP 2.3 or earlier versions?

Will it accept and validate certificates/signatures from the Internet
IPRA/PEM heirarchy (although IPRA isn't up yet, RSADSI has at least two PCAs
running)?

Is this a cooperative venture with RSADSI--or a consequence of MIT's being
one of the original patent holders? Putting it another way, what, if
anything, has Jim Bidzos said about this?

Will there be a Mac version? A mailer version along the lines of
Techmail-PEM?

Congratulations to those who did the work that must have gone into this. It
will be good to see this PGP versus RSADSI business go away.

Oh, yes, and if this won't interoperate with earlier versions, what are the
Europeans going to do? Is it going to be exportable? If not, does someone
have to violate the ITAR?

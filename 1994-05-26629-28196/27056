	Maybe it hasn't occured to you that American power has a very 
long reach. The US can pressure other countries to enact similar laws... 
an block traffic from those who don't. Be afraid. Be very afraid. It 
wouldn't happen overnight, but it could happen within the sapce of a few 
months. It is of course, the archest hipocrisy - we pressured Thailand to 
allow American cig. companies to advertise on TV there, something not 
allowed in the US. We pressure other countries not to ban pesticides we 
have banned ourselves, such as DDT. The US gov't seems bent on creating a 
worldwide empire - not an empire with an emperor, but a hegemony, where 
all nations answer to the US. It's happening right now - just look, and 
you will see.

If you are interested in books on cryptanalysis, have you looked at the 
Military Cryptanalytics series by Friedman and Callimahos.  I imagine 
that they are in libraries somewhere.  They are also available through
 
        Aegean Park Press
        P. O. Box 2837
        Laguna Hills, CA  92654-0837

which publishes quite a few cryptology books.

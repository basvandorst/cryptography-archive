Yes, and going from other assumptions you would still get different numbers.
There is one constant in those responses: the numbers Bob Silverman gave you,
which you disqualified as being insufficient, both responses are based on
those numbers.  Do you still wonder that Bob Silverman gave you those numbers
and asked you to do the remainder of the arithmetic yourself?

In that case *do* it.  You know what assumptions you want to make, nobody
else knows them (your originial post leaves very much to be desired on
exactness).  (And none of the two answers you received completely answers
your original assumptions.)

You have not distinguished yourself either.  You tell us you are an expert
on the abilities of the NSA (when somebody says that NSA could not get
better hardware than off the shelf you discounted that as nonsense).  Still
when somebody else bases his calculations on off the shelf hardware you
think that is a great analysis.

Read your original terms and see that none answered them in those terms.
The reason is that they can not be answered in those terms.

We have simply the hard facts that with current knowledge a 1024 bit key
is 20,000 times as hard as the key factored (re: Bob Silverman, who, indeed,
does know such things).  Algorithms on which people are working (yes, also
here) might do better, but how much better is not yet known.  When you want
to translate that to postulated hardware, please make known exactly what
that postulated hardware is.  Processors 10 times as fast do not buy us
anything unless memory becomes 10 times as fast, and as another respondent
told us already, that is extremely unlikely (and that was from his expertise).

To do a complete analysis in the sense you want requires a couple of
people each with their own expertise.  You can not expect from a number
theorist to theorize about the hardware available in the near feature,
nor can you expect from a hardware specialist to theorize about the
relative difficulties of cracking a small number vs. cracking a large
number.

Please accept that estimating the cost assuming some postulated hardware
is not a single mans endeavour.

In article <2q5ifj$aur@earendel.umiacs.umd.edu>, David Harwood
<harwood@umiacs.umd.edu> wrote a series of 'on the one hand; on the other
hand' arabesques that would gladden any economist's or scenario analyst's
heart. Unfortunately, he does not provide an answer, and attributes this to
an incomplete description on my part of the structure of the machine I
specified. Along the way he waves costs in the air.

I thought I had already dealt with both issues in my suggested assumptions,
by specifying $30 million and best current parallel processor architecture,
optimized for the problem.

If he feels he needs further simplifying assumptions to answer the question,
he can either adopt them, state them, and post his answer, or ask for them
with the intention of then doing the analysis, or silently pass. Posts
saying, in effect, *****I***** can't (or won't) answer your question, aren't
helpful, particularly when the question was asked generally, not of a
specific participant here.

I know you mean well, but you REALLY should try to follow the discussion. It
was not I who asked people to mail me, but an infrequently posting bystander
who had no reason to be in anyone's kill file.

It wasn't MY article, and it was posted to the groups with the most
animated discussion of this topic on the net. In judging the responses
singularly unpersuasive by their number, I was allowing for the broader
posting of the CPSR appeal. Said broader posting, by the way, took place in
stages. The original 10,000 have signed claim was before the broader posts
by CPSR.

It wasn't my "smear campaign" but a suggestion by another in response to my
comment that it wasn't clear that the signatures were all genuine. He
suggested, in an inflammatory atmosphere where feelings ran high, that
Clipper opponents "show me". That's a pretty good temptation to do so.

The only way they could do so was by intercepting many messages to me so I'd
never see them. The number I received was so low that there was no reason to
believe they were bogus. If anything, the cypherpunks would have flooded me
if they were intent on hoaxing me.

By the way, I don't suggest their motive was to hoax CPSR in the ordinary
sense. I suggest it was to create a false impression of the magnitude of the
opposition to Clipper. Perhaps in that sense one could say they were hoaxing
CPSR.

Finally, there was never an issue of whether there were _any_ bogus
signatures or not. CPSR fans and Clipper opponents in the discussion
(several) said that they would expect about 10 percent of the signatures to
be bogus. The issue wasn't about whether, but how many. CPSR itself, via
Sobel's post, acknowledges that there were a number of signatures THEY
though bogus enough not to count.

Best;

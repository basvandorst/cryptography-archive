Look at the Rabin Paper:

Michael O. Rabin, "Digitalized Signatures and Public Key Functions as
		   Intractable as Factorization", 
	MIT/LCS/TR-212, Cambridge, Massachusetts (1979).


Let the number n be not the power of a prime.

The idea is this:
	- take a random number x;
	- compute s = x^2 mod n.

Now you know two roots mod n of s, namely x and -x. If n is a prime, 
there is no other root--this case is not interesting for us. Otherwise
there is at least one number y with 
			y^2 = (-y)^2 = s mod n
(exactly one if n is the product of two primes). 

If we know y, the number gcd(x+y,n) is a nontrivial divisor of n (left
as exercise 8^). If there is an algorithm for computing square roots 
mod n it doesn't "know" which root we know. Thus with a chance of at
least 50% bye one application of the square root algorithm we find a
nontrivial divisor of the composed number n.

Thus we have proven:
THEOREM If there is an efficient algorithm R for computing square roots
	mod n, there is an efficient (probabilistic) algorithm F for
	finding nontrivial divisors of n.
	
In the average F needs not much more than twice the time R needs.

I hope that helps!

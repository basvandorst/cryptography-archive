The latter is right.  Vector units that do fast strided "vector+constant"
access are a tremendous help.  However, you ought not to focus on
aggregate bandwidth; what is important is bandwidths in those "vector+
constant" accesses with some "random" stride.  I do not have any idea how
well the CM5 does in this.  Memory banking does help with some power of 2,
as all strides are an odd prime.

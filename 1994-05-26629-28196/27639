This would be extremely unhealthy to the people involved in PGP in the US.  
Sure, noone outside the US will be hit, but the appearance of an 
export-restricted item outside the US will be a great excuse for a 
witch-hunt against anyone originally involved with it in the US.  For 
example, it could be used as an excuse to stomp on MIT - "If you're not 
exporting it then how come it's available for FTP in Moscow?".

Exactly what is it you're trying to do?  If the key is secret, you can
run DES in CBC mode, and keep only the last block; the resulting check
value is known as a MAC.

If you're trying to do something MD5-like, by using a constant key,
the scheme I suggested above doesn't work.  You can build a hash function
from DES, but it's more complex.

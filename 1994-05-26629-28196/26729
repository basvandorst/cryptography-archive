Trying again to demonize someone through a smear that you invented out of
whole cloth, Sternlight? Why not get together with L. Detweiler and
develop the Unified Tentacle theory of Evil that you can accuse the
CPSR, Mike Godwin, Jim Thomas, and whoever else you can try to smear
by lying and innuendo?

I just want to ask one civil question: do you get aroused when people
point out your lies and misrepresentations? Whatever else could
motivate you to humiliate yourself in front of so many people? Some
weird flagellant cult?  What is it?

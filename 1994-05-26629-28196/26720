Thanks for responding, but your answer, like many of the other similar
posts, is both non-responsive and unhelpful.

I don't want to know how much harder it is. I want to know how long it will
take an adversary with particular capabilities to do it.

There are many inefficiencies in the RSA-129 exercise. Slower machines than
an adversary of the sort I mention would have were used. They were used only
a small part of the elapsed calendar time. They were not custom
state-of-the-art for the task.

Thus it's no use for me to hear that it's "x" times harder. If you tell me
the NSA, GCHQ, the Japanes or French, with the hardware I specified, could
break a 512 bit key in "y" months, or a 1024 bit key in "z" years, THAT's
what I need to know to assess my risk.

I'm afraid what I'm seeing so far are bald assertions, supported by "off the
cuff" easy calculations as a real-time typing response to a message, rather
than the kind of detailed analysis needed to know where we stand.
Unfortunately I'm not expert enough in this area to do the number crunching
myself, but my hope is that any smart engineer or cryptologist knowledgeable
in these matters could knock the analysis out in a fairly short time.

Let's hope any further responses answer the question asked, rather than
looking for the key down the block from where it was lost because the light
is better there.

Nothing personal--your contributions have been quite useful as far as they
go.

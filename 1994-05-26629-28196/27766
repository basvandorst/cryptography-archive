A while ago here in Norway, there was quite a lot of rumors about the security of
cash machines(or whatever they are called in english). What happened was that
somone who lost her magnetic card had her account emptied just half an hour
later. The code we use here is a four digit number, and I think the coding
algorithm is called a PIN code. What is this and is it secure? If it is not, why
do the banks use it? In my opinion it would'nt be that hard to make a code that
nobody could break in a reasonable amount of time. Anyone else heard about this
security problem?

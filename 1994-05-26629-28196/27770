What's the problem?  Sounds to me like he was using definition #2.  It says
"excessive *or* irrational", not "excessive *and* irrational".  I think when
DS wrote, "I don't say unjustified", he eliminated the "or irrational" phrase.
Now read it again: "a tendency on the part of individuals or groups toward
excessive suspiciousness and distrustfulness of others."  Sounds to me like
DS is saying that some members of the PGP crowd are more suspicious than most
people (not surprising, since they are using PGP to protect themselves while
most of us aren't), and is also deliberately *not* saying that their higher
than normal suspicions are unjustified.  Sounds to me like he's cutting them
some slack.

a) MIT has published the "theory" (As the RSA system, many years ago, as the
protocol for PGP 2.6 it is freely exportable and obtainable from anon ftp from MIT)
It
It Cannot make PGP2.6 exportable since it would be violating US law. 
A lookalike implimentation of the RSA algorithm is already in PGP2.3a. So with 
a lookalike which violates no copyright laws, and with the protocol specs which are freely
exportable it will not take long to produce a PGP 3.ABNA (Anywhere but North
America) version. Remember that in some sense RSA IS MIT MIT hold the patents (with
Stanford). Why should they write another version? Remember they were the ones who
gave RSA DAta an exclusive license. 
So don't worry Things really are working out to create the best of all possible
worlds. Even David Sternlight is happy!

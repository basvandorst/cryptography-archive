Not quite.  I'm no expert in the field of quantum computation or
quantum mecanics, but...

When you split off into different superposition of states, you can't
assign any amplitude you want; you have to use a unitary
transformation.  If there is a single state that reached the answer,
you will have only a minimal chance of observing that state.  What you
have to do, is find enough end states that can interfere with each
other to make an event with a high probability of detection (while the
uninteresting states interfere destructively and can't be observed).

It may well be possible that you can't base cryptography on
complexity.  But then you'll be able to base it on quantum mecanics
(see Scientific American, nov93 or was that nov92?).

Well, there are many issues... technologically, it is difficult to put
a QM system in a precise initial state;  you can't have error
correction in the computations because error correction is non-linear
(it would force the collapse of the wave function and destroy the
interference). The most serious is probably that we don't know wether
complex systems can stay in a superposition of states (Schrodinger's
cat).

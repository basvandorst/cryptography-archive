I need a private key encryption method, to encrypt files accompanying my
commercial software program (the encryption algorithm will not be available
to my clients, I just want to defend my files), I need to ship it overseas.

DES is out, because of the export restrictions
IDEA, indicated to me that it was NOT to be used for commercial purposes.
RSA is public key.

I would like a reasonably secure one, any that I could invent would be wholly
indadequate.

Are there others that I am not aware of ?

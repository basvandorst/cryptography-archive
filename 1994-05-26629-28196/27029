The machine cost was quoted at $300 million, so $30 million was mooted 
for three months use.  These are not my figures!  

Sorry about the "pounds" though.  It was a slip, but not just from 
habit.  In the UK, computer stuff from the US (software mostly) is 
priced by converting dollars to pounds at a one to one ratio.

I think it is, though.  I mean, that is what I have gathered from 
postings by those who know, where RSA key breaking is concerned.

I am not an expert in the maths.  I have written a DES implementation 
in assembler, but that was coding from a recipe.  For RSA, I understand 
that you must factor the public key for each key you wish to break, and 
that this process takes about the same time/effort for each key (of the 
same size).

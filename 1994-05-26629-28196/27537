>I am looking for PANGRAMS!

I recently wrote a program to search for "perfect" 26-letter pangrams using
only words in the Unix spell-checking dictionary. (I threw out the 2-letter
state abbreviations, since otherwise they dominate the results.) It found
several hundreds of combinations that worked, but most of them didn't even
come close to scanning as English sentences. The best of the lot was:

"Jocks find quartz glyph, vex BMW."

I sent this off to Stephen J. Gould, who had asked in one of his books a
few years ago if anyone could come up with a more sensible "perfect" pangram
than "Zing! Vext cwm fly jabs Kurd qoph." He answered that my sentence is the
best he's received in response to his challenge so far... but still not as
good as he is hoping to receive. I suppose I should try the program again
with a larger dictionary. Does anyone know where a really good word list
(containing only valid English words) could be found online (unencrypted)?
All the commercial programs I have access to have encrypted spelling-check
dictionaries!

... "are you not a greater computer than the Milliard Gargantubrain at
Maximegalon which can count all the atoms in a star in a millisecond?"

   "The Milliard Gargantbrain?" said Deep Thought with unconcealed contempt.
"A mere abacus - mention it not."

   "And are you not," said Fook leaning anxiously forward, "a greater
analyst than the Googleplex Star Thinker in the Seventh Galaxy of Light and
Ingenuity which can calculat the trajectory of every single dust particle
throught a five-week Dangrabed Beta sans blizzard?"

   "A five-week sand blizzard?" said Deep Thought haightily. "You ask this
of me who have contemplated the very vectors of the atoms in the Big Bang
itself? Molest me not with this pocket calculator stuff."

   The two programmers sat in uncomfortable silence for a moment. Then
Lunkwill leaned forward again.

   "But are you not," he said, "a more fiendish disputant than the Great
Hyperlobic Omni-Cognate Neutron Wrangler of Ciceronicus Twelve, the Magic
and Indefatigable?"

   "The Great Hyperlobic Omni-Cognate Neutron Wrangler," said Deep Thought,
thoroughly rolling the *r*'s, "could talk all four legs off an Arcturan
Mega-Donkey - but only I could persuade it to go for a walk afterward."

   "Then what," asked Fook, "is the problem?"

   "There is no problem," said Deep Thought with magnificent ringing tones.
"I am simply the second greatest computer in the Universe of Space and Time."

   "But the *second*?" insisted Lunkwill. "Why do you keep saying the second?
You're surely not thinking of the Multicorticoid Perspicutron Titan Muller,
are you? Or the Pondermatic? Or the..."

   Contemptuous lights flashed across the computer's console.

   "I spare not a single unit of thought on these cybernetic simpletons!"
he boomed. "I speak of none but the computer that is to come after me!"

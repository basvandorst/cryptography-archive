Why couldn't ViaCrypt just take PGP 2.6 and offer it as an upgrade to
commercial users?  Was not the only difference between ViaCrypt's PGP
and the non-commercial PGP was that ViaCrypt's used RSAREF instead of
RSA code written from scratch? 

Now that PGP 2.6 uses RSAREF, couldn't ViaCrypt just take PGP 2.6 and sell
it.  The only difference would them be that ViaCrypt PGP 2.6 comes with a
license for commercial use while the free PGP 2.6 does not.

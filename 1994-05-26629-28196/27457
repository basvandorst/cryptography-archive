We digress...

We have had a political party here in Iowa called the Natural
Law party.  The leaders and many members are folks from the Maharishi
(sp?) International University in Fairfield - the Transcendental
Meditation
folks.  What they were saying about Natural Law was that if you do
a scientific study which says something works, and you agree that
the study shows that it works, you are pretty much obligated to institue
what the study shows.  Specifically they were talking about a study
that shows prisoners who practice TM are much less likely to
go back to their criminal ways after release.  This seems quite logical
to me.  The effect is that they want Iowa and other places to start
TM programs in prisons.

I'm personally all for anything which would reduce the criminal impulse,
especially for those already in jail.  They are right:  When something
works - and you can demonstrate its benefits - it should be put into
practice.  To do otherwise is to fly in the face of Nature!

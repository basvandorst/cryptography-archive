This seems an absurdly imprudent request.

If as your subject line suggests these requested documents
are in fact classified, one would have to be *really*
stupid to comply.

I fear as well that you are somewhat naive regarding the degree
of anonymity afforded by anonymous posting services. It seems
likely that if someone *really* wanted to find you, they could.

Something like, conspiracy to commit espionage, conspiracy to
export classified materials and so forth might just make someone,
particularly someone with deep pockets and ample resources,
*really* want to find you.

Good Luck.

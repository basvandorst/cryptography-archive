Could you name some of the groups.  I have seen your posts on several groups,
and I have NEVER seen you take the opposite position.  I don't think you've
used behavior "X" on any posts recently, but instead have spent all your
time responding to (justified or not) personal attacks.

I will say, for the record, that I think your position has been "X", but I
wouldn't have brought it up if you hadn't.

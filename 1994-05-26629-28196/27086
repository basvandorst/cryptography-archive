In answer to the intensly vital question what is a "squemish ossifrage"
after huge amounts of research (I looked in a dictionary) I can now reveal 
that it is a nervous bone breaking bird, or a bone breaking bird of a sensitive
disposition.
The question now remains why is it squeamish and what bones is it going to
break.
And why on ert did they choose this phrase.

Tune in next week same bat time same bat channel when these and other
vital questions will be vigorously avoided. :)

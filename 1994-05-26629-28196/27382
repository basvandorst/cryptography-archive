It's a matter of U.S. law, and it makes it illegal to export cryptographic
software from the U.S.  Once it's out, however, there are no encumbrances.
Even the U.S. mostly (Panama and Mexico have observed exceptions :-()
recognizes that its laws only apply within their borders.

>QUESTION3: Can I legally use these programs after FTPing them?

Any software (e.g. not rsa.com:pub/faq, which is text) that performs
encryption (I don't think beta.xerox.com:pub/hash counts) is illegal to
export from the U.S.  without a pile of paperwork which may or may not
get approved.

So I'd avoid ftp.uu.net, rsa.com and ripem.msu.edu if you care about U.S.
law.  Note that you're not obligated to, and even if the U.S. were to
fuss if you ever travelled to within its jurisdiction (low probability;
when I left the U.S. last year with crypto source code, two customs agents
(Detroit and Peace Bridge, NY) advised me to junk the paperwork I was
trying to file with them and just *go*; I had to spend 20 minutes with the
ITAR explaining), they'd have a hard time proving it was really you.

Still, it would be polite to the site admins not to give them any
reason to be hassled by the export control people.  But the basic
summary is, you aren't in the U.S., so the stupid laws don't apply to
you.  Forget about them.

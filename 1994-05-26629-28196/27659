     I think I understand your argument against the current PK

   mechanism for key distribution opens a much bigger hole in the
   overall security of the system, have you a better alternative?

Hi, Lymon!  Long time, no see! :-)

Actually, it is possible to prove that a PK system is secure against
all polynomial attacks, and that it doesn't leak any information, etc.
RSA, however, does not fit in this.  For example, pure RSA is
multiplicative, which means that if I can get you to sign two
messages, a and b, then I can create a third message c == a*b and the
signature s(c) == s(a)*s(b).

Another leak is that in RSA you can get, I believe, the
least-significant bit of the message.  (I.e., you know if it is odd or
even).

Also, since the same message will always generate the same encryption,
you can take two messages, m and m', and you can distinguish the
encrypted messages e(m) and e(m') from each other.

There are probably other things that I am missing, and I am doing a
lot of hand-waving.

I don't mean to say that there are not ways around this; just that the
*pure* system has these flaws.

Now that a 512 bit RSA modulus is no longer safe from factorisation, why
the rush to move straight up to a 2-prime 1024 bit modulus?

An alternative: Use RSA with four 256-bit primes, n=p.q.r.s
This works perfectly well - I've done it (although it hasn't been subject 
to such thorough analysis as the 2-prime variety).

Compared to 2-prime RSA, key generation takes only twice as long, decryption
is just over twice as slow (using the Chinese remainder thereom method). 
Encryption will admittedly be slower, but with a small encrypting exponent
this might not matter.

The 4-prime 1024 bit modulus is as safe from the quadratic sieve as the 
2-prime variety, and factoring mothods (such as Elliptic Curve) that
specialise in finding small factors are nowhere near good enough to find
256 bit factors (best so far < 128 bits I think)

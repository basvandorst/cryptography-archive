Since Martigny has gone and since Wasabi is sometimes out of date,
I'd consider it a MPITA (major pain in you know where).

On the other hand, having a public key gives you almost nothing - as
long as the web of trust is so incomplete, you won't have enough
trusted introducers.  Thus I consider it an _advantage_ of PGP: if you
know how to get a public key, there's high probability that you know
how much it's worth.

(Besides that: the RIPEM feature of automatically fingering the
partner and/or contacting a key server is WAY COOL!)

Yes, it cannot have, because it's against the PGP philosophy.
prz@acm.org doesn't believe in a "central authority" aka "standard
certifier", and I think that's a philosophical bonus for PGP.

Handy for the newcomers who don't know too much about relative
security.  A RIPEM certificate somehow leaves the impression that the
public key really belongs to you.  If you begin to use PGP, everybody
(including the docs) tells you that public keys per se are no good for
authorization - you really need a phone conversation or at least a
path through the web of trust in order to attach some credibility to
it.

Although I don't quite believe you, it's nice to note that.

Yes.  PGP is contraband in more than one sense.  You don't talk
securely to people who don't use PGP or whose public key has not
enough credibility.  This is perfectly reasonable - and this will hurt
the use of PGP as a standard encryption feature, although you can
always have something like SLED if _some_ security is enough for you.

I don't see your point.  Once you have a public key, you have a
relatively secure communication channel and nothing else.  You can use
this channel to announce a phone call, but that's all if you want to
exchange _really_ critical mail.

It _is_ professional in the sense that it tends to be used by people
who know what it's worth.  It's not friendly to people who believe in
some human being (or even some politician) who just tells them "Trust me!".

There are things like that.  Incidentally, both of them are called
"GNU Emacs" :-)

I think it's hard to put that better.  Especially, PGP doesn't claim
to be more - in contrast to something more commercial (and less
contraband) which more often claims to be more than it is.

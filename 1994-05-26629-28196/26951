Why do I get the feeling I need a rubber stamp saying "wrong again" to
respond to Steve's messages?

I did not make unsubstantiated smears of the petition. I said I thought some
of the responses were bogus. Some of CPSR's own fans agreed--the dispute was
about how to find out how many.

I said CPSR didn't say anything about any serious validation of the
signatures in the press releases trumpeting the numbers. Nothing
unsubstantiated about that--the press releases were posted for all to read.

I never even attacked the petition itself. What I did was call for CPSR to
validate the signatures, since they were given in an atmosphere of
cypherpunks posting forgeries, bogus messages, and announcing how easily
they could fake signatures (compete with technical detail). I then
criticized CPSR for failing to do what I thought to be reasonable
validation. Others even posted suggested approaches to validation, though
CPSR has not said they've used any of those suggestions.

I see Steve, too, has gone to the Jim Thomas school of accusing another of
what you yourself are doing, in charging me with unsubstantiated smears.
It's not an infinite regress, by the way, Steve, since I've provided
substantiation in this message, unlike yours.

Readers who are annoyed at this waste of bandwidth will be happy to know
that as a self-discipline device I've now put Steve in my kill file as well.
It's not that he's been crude or rude--quite the contrary he's always been
pretty polite. But there needs to be some way of putting a stop to this, and
rather than reading his next, feeling compelled to respond, etc. etc., I'm
going to deprive myself of his future wisdom as a gesture of self-sacrifice
so that we can return to our regularly scheduled program. As usual, future
silence in the face of his posts does not constitute assent.

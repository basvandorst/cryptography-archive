Three small things:
- ever read 1984 by George Orwell? that shows how thoughts can be
  "violated"
- just because something is a right, it doesn't mean its a right in
  "natural law"
- this discussion doesn't belong in this conference.  sci.crypt is
  supposed to focus on the technical, not social, phylisophical, or
  psychological aspects of cryptography.

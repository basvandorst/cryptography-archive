D.S. turned up on sci.crypt sometime in 1992 and almost immediately
got on Grady's nerves at a time when sci.crypt regulars were getting
quite hot under the collar about "off-topic" postings such as this
one. It reminds me of the Pink Panther films where Cleuseau (sp?)
drives poor Chief Inspector Dreyfus insane.

Why not compile a Sternlight FAQ ? Here's something for the "Sternlight
wastes the net hundreds if not thousands of dollars -- again !" section.

Arjen Lenstra posts a 3-week factorization of a 158 digit number which
is the product of a 69 and 90 digit prime. Please help a layman
understand the significance of this.

What does this mean, if anything, for the "cracking" of an RSA 1024 bit
key? for DES?

Sternlight ? Clueless ? Nahh... :-)

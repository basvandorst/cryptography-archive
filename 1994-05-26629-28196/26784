I think we have a new FAQ question here...

I'm not sure if I can provide a proper answer, but here goes:

An RSA key is "broken" by factoring the modulus.  The larger the modulus
(and thus its component primes) the harder (and longer) it takes.

A key to a conventional (or symmetric) cipher like DES/Clipper/IDEA is
broken by trying every possible key until you get the right one.
(barring any more efficient attack being discovered, as usually are)

The processes involved are quite different and thus you can't really
compare key lengths between a public key algorithm and a secret key
algorithm.  I have read an estimate that a 128 bit IDEA key would take
as much time to brute force as it would take to factor a 3100 bit
RSA key.  I don't know if this is exactly right, but its in the right
direction and it points up the differences in breaking the key.  This
would mean for example, that if you wanted to break pgp, assuming
the implementation is secure, the RSA key would be the weak link in the
chain.  i.e. it would be easier to factor a 1024 bit modulus than
brute force a 128 bit IDEA key... not that factoring a 1024 bit modulus
is very easy, as we have all seen.

Hope this helps.

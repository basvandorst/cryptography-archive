      Since I have botched my second reply to your recent posting regarding
the factoring of N = P*Q when its totient is known, allow me to set the matter
straight. The solution is exceedingly simple when both P and Q are so-called
safe primes.
      Consider this:
      P = 2*p + 1
      Q = 2*q + 1
      N = 4*p*q + 2*(p + q) + 1
      phi(N) = 4*p*q
and
      (p + q) = (N-(phi(N)+1))/2

Let's set
      p = x - q
and
      p*q = y
so that we have
      x*q - q^2 = y
or
      q^2 - x*q + y = 0
The solution, of course, is:
      q,p = (x +/-(x^2 - phi(N)))/2
      Here is an example:
      p = 1049, P = 2099
      q = 2819, Q = 5639
      (p + q) = 3868
      N = 118 362 61
      phi(N) = 118 285 24
      ((p + q)^2 - phi(N))^1/2 = 1770
      ((p + q) -1770)/2 = 1049
      ((p + q) +1770)/2 = 2819
When the primes P and Q are not of the "safe" variety, the algorithm of
DeLaurentis is available. In both cases, of course, we assume that phi(N),
or its equivalents, the encrypting and decrypting exponents, are known. To
a subscriber of a community using a common modulus N this is, therefore, a
rather simple matter to factor it, provided that suitable software resources
are available.

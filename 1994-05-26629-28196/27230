Gentle folk,

I'm currently performing a code review of some RSA key generation
software. The prime number generation algorithm works as follows:-

1. A random, odd number of the appropriate size is generated.
2. Trial divisions are performed by small primes (up to 2069).
3. Four iterations of the Lehmann test are performed if the number
   passes step 2.
4. If the number passes step3 it is assumed to be prime.

My questions are:-

a. Should more iterations be performed of the Lehmann test? My
understanding is that this test is only passed with a probability
of a little over 50%. If this is so, then a composite number will
be chosen in about 1 case in 10000 on average.
 
b. If a composite number is inadvertently chosen by the algorithm,
will a trial RSA encryption and decryption using keys built from this
number and another prime definitely fail? If so, this could be
regarded as a final test.

You may gather from the above that I'm not a mathematician.
Apologies if these questions are rather basic.

Cheers
phil

   I quote, from Tom Rearick of the Lotus Word Processing Division.  "A
   consultant is needed IMMEDIATELY to document how to break this code
   (or demonstrate that a 12-character splay encryption provides less
   security than a 40-bit RSA) and/or to travel with us to the NSA spook
   house in Fort Mead, MD."


The requirement is simply that there can't be more than
40 bits of key.  A recent article by people at IBM's Federal Systems
group (now part of Loral)
(Johnson, Matyas, Le & Wilkins, IBM J. Res. Develop. v. 38 p.217)
describes a variant of DES which has only 40 bit keys.  This "data masking"
algorithm, (the authors don't want to call it cryptographic) is designed
as a drop in replacement for DES.  They said the design goal of 40 bit keys
was because "When the keys are limited to 40 bits, products implementing 
these algorithms [RSADSI's RC2, and RC4] are generally exportable under 
U.S Dept. of Commerce jurisdiction."

My dad and I also visited the museum last week. Olin's description was
pretty complete so I won't duplicate what he wrote.

My personal favorite among the exhibits was the Enigma display,
especially the working, hands-on machine. Having read quite a bit
about this machine I had no trouble enciphering and deciphering a
message on the first try ("HELLO"). They even provide a pad and pencil
for your convenience!

I knew that the Germans had separate Enigma models for each military
branch, but I hadn't known about the special printing unit for use on
U-boats. Ordinarily it took three operators to run an Enigma machine:
one to read off the plain/cipher message, one to type it in, and one
to write down the cipher/plain message. (The exhibit included a
photograph of three German soldiers operating one.) This is
impractical in the close quarters of a submarine, so a unit with a
built-in tape printer was designed to allow operation by a single
person, who was presumably also the radio operator.

Right. Do *not* take the "NSA Employees Only" exit from the southbound
BW parkway, even though it seems to be on the opposite side of the
freeway from Rt 32 west. We did that and ended up lost (but not shot!)

|> Soviet exhibit: 1960-vintage spy radio, photos from KGB museum (no crypto)

The spy radio looked very much like a small homebuilt amateur radio
station from that era. I found it interesting that they always used
components of local origin, with labels written in the local language
(e.g., this particular transmitter used metal-cased 6L6 tubes, and was
labeled in English.)

Including the large US flag that flew during the attack. I could easily
see how the Israelis might have mistaken it for an Egyptian flag...NOT!

I assume this was the room off to the side of the entrance hallway,
which was roped off at the time I was there. Peering through the
doorway to the left rear of the room I saw a very familar looking
PDP-11/70, complete with freestanding RP-06 style drives, Dectape,
etc. To the right of the PDP-11 was a series of desk positions with
telephones that appeared to be various models of the STU-III. From a
distance I think I recognized the Motorola and GE units, which I've
examined before.  I was momentarily surprised to think that they would
allow the public to handle Controlled Cryptographic Items.  I presume
that they are actually either Type III (DES) units or perhaps have had
all cryptography removed - after all, if you're just trying to
demonstrate to the public what talking over the STU-III is like, all
you really need are the vocoders.

Right. Except for the Cray and the microelectronics facility exhibits,
the displays stopped at the end of WWII. Not too surprising.

Right again. I was amused to see the TELETYPE CORP name plates on many
of the machines. In their construction, they really did resemble the
mechanical teletype machines of the 50s and 60s, which I remember well
from my early days in ham radio.

However you may have noted that the US machines had many more rotors than
their German counterparts; I think I saw at least 5 rotors on most of the
US machines.

Definitely. Small but very interesting. I took a roll of photos that are
currently being processed. If I can find a scanner when I get them back,
I'll put up some of the more interesting ones on the net.

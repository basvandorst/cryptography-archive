I do not understand this figure. If I use the estimates of the number of
ops needed to factor based say on Rivest's paper of 1990 ( which is very
close to the number of ops actually used to factor RSA129), I get a
factor closer to 10^11 rather than 20,000. (Ie using Rivest A(n) as the
estimate). That makes a bit of a difference (like 10^7 years ratehr than
4 months). Where did the number 20,000 come from?

On the other hand, allow it to encrypt an A to an A might allow
portions of the message to "seep through". I suppose the chances
of a full word "seeping through" are probably low, but it would still
worry me.

It seems to me, that the only advantage to routing the current back through
the rotors, is to foil those who have no knowlege of the rotor wirings.
After the wiring is known, I cannot see any benefit.  Actually, I take
that back... it does one more thing- it puts the current through the
steckerboard twice.

I believe that the real reason it was fed in, and then back thru
the rotors was because of its economic design. The keys and the lamps were
all connected to the stecker/and same end of the rotors. This gave it its
capability to both encode and decode.  A one way route through the rotors
would (I think) create an encrypt/decrypt only mechanism.

The machine is amazingly simple... take the following circuit, and
then add a plug board and a few rotors to scramble the connections.

         *lit*             === KEY
 +-------LAMP-----<---O     |           
 |                   ---------------O--<---//-----STECKER+SCRAMBLER---+

                                                                      |
                                                                      |

 |                          |   /---O------//------->-----------------+
 |                   ---------/                  Current              
 |     BATTERY + -----O                                               
GND                                                                   
                                                                       
In the above diagram, you can see how a pressed key, can light any other
lamp (any but its own).  All that was needed was a scrambling apparatus
in between. This leads to a couple of other possible "abusive" situation
properties:

	1. If two keys are pressed at the same time, and they scramble
	   to different letters, then two lamps light.

	1. If two keys are pressed, and the scramble to each other, then
	   no lamps light (+ to +, thus no current flow).

I have got my PC full screen mockup of the ENIGMA going, but I am still in
search of the authentic rotor wirings. I am in the process of obtaining
books that might help.  If someone out there has the BASIC program that
was mentioned for the ENIGMA, please pass it along.  I'd like to see
what rotor wirings they used in it.

I am also led to assume, that the rotor advanced its position AFTER the
key was pressed (and subsequently released). Is this in fact the case?

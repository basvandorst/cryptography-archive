If you would please include Mr. Sternlight's last name in your text to,
for, or about him, or at least not delete the original instance, then
those of us with kill files would not have to read it.  If you had not
deleted his name, I would not have seen your message.

Since I've included his name, people with reasonable kill files will be
spared reading this text.

Why do you think Mr. Sternlight posts?  Does anyone not think that he
enjoys flaming and being flamed?  The best squelch to such self-styled
policy analysts as Mr. Sternlight is to completely ignore them.

His enormously funny jokes like "I wrote part of Fortran" are just not
worth his noise.

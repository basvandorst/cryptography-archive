How so?  If I write a library and license it to you, and you sell a
program made with it, and I give away a program made with it, I
haven't done anything wrong unless I told you I wouldn't.  You seem to
be saying there's something wrong with that.

Anyway, it wasn't PKP that licensed RSAREF to ViaCrypt, it was RSADSI.

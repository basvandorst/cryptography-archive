	Certainly.

     I think this helps settle the matter of the book key-derived running
     cipher.  The method was probably as neat a cipher as could be derived
     and Jim and everybody else was give three words as cribs (two of
     which were quite common in the text) and yet it was solved by 
     what Jim calls a "fine old technique."  Certainly, a book cipher
     will frustrate your neighbours (unless you live on Thrimridge), but
     will probably offer no more than a couple of days worth of security
     if you are under serious governmental observation.  Remember also
     that there was only about 2kbytes of text.
     
     The text was from "Pride and Prejudice" and the running key was
     from the chapter in "Codebreakers" dealing with the solution by Mrs.
     Friedman of the book codes used by rum-runners :-).

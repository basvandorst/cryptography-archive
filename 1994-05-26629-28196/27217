Okay, I'll bite. I'm not sure of the context in which this thread
started, so forgive me if this makes no sense...

If both keys are kept secret, what makes this different from a private
key cryptosystem? Aside from the fact that the public key system is
much slower than the private key system, of course. 

The only advantage I can think of is that the consequences of having
the (pseudo)public key stolen during transmission are less severe, but
than it is not a secret anymore, so that's a nonissue. 

Public key cryptosystems were designed to be just that -- public.
Unless the algorithm is severly flawed, there is no danger in leaving
the public key public, THEORETICALLY.

Besides, both public key cryptosystems are vulnerable to something
like a man-in-the-middle attack. That is enough to convince some
people that public key is weak. But that's also why we have interlock
protocols...

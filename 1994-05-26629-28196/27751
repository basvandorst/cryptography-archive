Hello:

In Applied Cryptography, Bruce Schneier suggests that the Digital Signature
Standard/Algorithm is, for the moment, royalty-free. He also notes that the
patent and licensing rights may be given to PKP.

Can anyone comment on the current status? Is it okay to use this algorithm
for signatures without licensing? If not, are there any other secure
signature algorithms which are in the public domain? I'm developing for a
new platform, so it is not possible for me to use the RSAREF libraries.

Thanks!
Reginald !:-)

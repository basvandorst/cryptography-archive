Assuming that I'd like to implement RSA legally, does anyone have
an idea of how much RSA licenses the algorithm for?  Do they license
to individuals, to businesses, what?  I know, I can ask them, but if
anyone knows, it would save a lot of confusion.

Also, does anyone know when their patent runs out?  Are patents good
for 99 years, or what?

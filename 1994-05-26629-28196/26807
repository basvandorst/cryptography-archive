I'm not speculating.  I'm trying to pull the discussion together so
that comments can be coherent, and address the real whole problem (as
indeed, yours does - thank you very much).

What I meant was, "the guy from TM just said the present hardware
architecture allows it."  Also, I think it's _un_reasonable to suppose
that the government has more advanced capabilities here than the
private sector - things are different now than they were in WW-II - so
this hypothetical machine would have to come from TM, not from the
secret computer works in the NSA's basement.  But if indeed TM can
build it, then they might indeed have (and of course, might indeed not
be free to admit it).  I was hoping for refinement on just how
reasonable it actualy is to build one ...

... like that.  Thanks again.

Ah, yes, of course you're right here.  Which unfortunately means that
all that discussion about the improbability of a 16Kp CM5 is
pointless.  Now, could there be 16K "unaccounted for" SparcStations
floating about?  The floor space implications bother me a bit here, as
does the power consumption - how sure are you, and why, that this
would be the cheaper-to-maintain configuration?

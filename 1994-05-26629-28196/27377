   This is certainly true - IBM and Bell Labs, among others, reported
working 0.1 micron ring oscillators at least years ISSCC.  THe performance
looked quite good (11.8 ps gate delays, as I recall).

  [Example deleted, you could get 1 500 MIP pentium for $30,000 if you
  built pentiums on a "lab-demo" production line...]

This technique is actually used in some cases.   I think that for the original
space telescope wide field planetary camera, they built a bunch of 800x800
CCDs on Textronics(?) lab lines.  Then they picked the best 4 of the whole
lot.  That's a lot of bucks for 4 CCDs, but what they got was way beyond the
state of the commercial production art at the time.  For low volume, high
performance applications it makes lots of sense.

For factoring, though, it's not useful.  You would rather have 100 Pentiums
at 50 MIPS each, than 1 Pentium at 500 MIPS.  This is because the factoring
problem parallelizes very well.  

Of course, lots of other problems the NSA is interested in do not parallelize
well, so maybe they use this idea.  There are a number of other tricks that
you can do in one of a kind machines as well - non standard supply voltages,
cooling the chip to liquid nitrogen temperature, and so on.  The astronomy
community is a good source of these tricks - they are always trying for the
absolute maximum performance, and only need to build a few of anything, and
have lots of smart grad student labor to keep them running.

So I think your idea is correct, in general, but does not affect the factoring
discussion in particular.

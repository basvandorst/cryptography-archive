I would not trust anyone who made the claim that 3000-bit keys won't
be broken even during the next 20 years. One can never predict when
a new algorithm might make factoring *easy*. If we could prove that
factoring is hard it would be a different story. But no such proof
is known. 
 
With current algorithms, 1024 bits will be safe for 25 years. No conceivable
increase in computer power will let one factor a 1-24-bit number in that
time frame. Within (say) 25 to 35 years it might be possible to pull together
enough hardware to do it, but doing ONE such number would be a massive effort.
I can't see 2048 bits being done in the next 100 years with existing algorithms.


New factoring algorithms have come along about every 5 years since 1970.

1970 - CFRAC
1975 - Pollard P-1
1980 - QS
1985 - MPQS and variants
1985 - ECM
1990 - NFS

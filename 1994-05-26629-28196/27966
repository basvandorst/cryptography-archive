He's the MIT Network Manager (at least according to his WWW home page:
http://www.mit.edu:8001/people/jis/jis.html).  

Last I knew (and this may be several years out of date), his area of
responsibility included everything related to local-area and IP
networking at MIT, up to and including the servers for common network
services like the Domain Name System, Kerberos, mail hubs and post
offices, etc.

He also had some involvement with MIT's installation of a #5ESS phone
switch (which was done back in 1988), though I don't think he has any
direct responsibility for voice telephony.

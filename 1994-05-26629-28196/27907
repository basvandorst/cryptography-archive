Eric:

SafeWord PC Lan-Safe will work in the environment you describe. There is
a cryptographically decimated demo version of this available for anonymous
ftp from:

ftp.netcom.com

In the following directory:

/pub/bbosen/Enigma/PC-LanSafe

Take a look at the readme file(s) there for more information. This
crippled version is fully functional except the cryptoalgorithm has been
replaced with a ridiculously primitive substitution table. It allows you
to test for compatibility and to evaluate the management options. For 
the real thing, you have to purchase the commercial product from
Enigma Logic, however. There are two version, one for USA and one for
export. Guess which one has better encryption?

Regards,

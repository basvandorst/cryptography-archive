Probably because it would be very difficult to decrypt through a 
cyphertext attack. It's a very short text, the distribution of letters is 
weird, and even if you started with the assumption that the first word 
was "the," you wouldn't gain a whole lot of useful info. Of course, one of
the challengers, Rivest I think, claims "squeamish ossifrage" was picked 
at random out of a dictionary.

True, but it would take some work to get the present program to run
in a DOS environment.  (A Unix environment wouldn't leave that much
RAM for the program and data.)

I looked, briefly, at trying to get mpqs and the supporting
scripts to run under DOS in one of the previous factoring runs,
and gave it up as too much work to do in an evening.  Lots of
unix-specific stuff in there.  Plus the DOS memory model...

Has anyone with more energy succeeded in this effort?

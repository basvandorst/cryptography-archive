Well, I decided to give this a try. Several tries, in fact. *Five* tries, to
be thoroughly specific. I don't recommend attempting to get access to the ftp
site unless there's *no* net.traffic. Because I'm in Canada, the lag (not
bad, considering) was enough so that, bu the time I quit my mail program and
reached the ftp site, the stupid directory/filename had changed.

This has got to be the dumbest method of distributing software I've ever seen.
I mean, geez! Change the filename less frequently than every dozen jiffies,
eh? I'm waiting until someone posts it to the net (ya gotta expect it ;-)

   Hmmm.  The real lower bound is o(1) with precomputation.  (All I
need to do is precompute a table of and do a lookup.  This is NOT a
silly observation, a have a book with such tables in my office, and I
suspect that you do too.)

   But any significant floor on the computational complexity (which
limits space and time) will probably solve P = NP.  (If the lower
bound on factoring is not polynomial P /= NP.  On the other hand, a
non-trivial polynomial lower bound on factoring might construct into a
non-polynomial lower bound on some NP-complete problem.)

   Translation: Don't hold your breath.

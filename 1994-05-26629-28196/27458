   Thus neatly demolishing David's argument.  If NSA turned to IBM for
hardware, that hardware may have been ahead of commercial state of the
practice, but hardly ahead of commercial state of the art.  With
modern chip fab techniques, that gap seems to be about 6-9 months.
i.e. About half a year after I can get preliminary performance results
from a new chip design, I can buy one in a desktop machine.

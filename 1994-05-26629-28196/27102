     I've never quite understood why that is the "normal" way of
approximating the asymptotic bound. Bob Silverman can give you a more
accurate formulation.  In any case, there is an o(1) term in the
exponent.  Rivest's paper has it as 2.08 for the general case of NFS.

     Without this term at N = 2^512 I get exp(23.0434) = 1.0177E10.
At N=2^768, I get exp(27.5788) = 9.49182E11, and for N=1024, I get
exp(31.2749) = 3.82414E13. Using 2.08 for the o(1) term I get
6.54414E20, 8.18138E24, and 1.78498E28 respectively.  2^256 is about
77 decimal digits, which implies that a factor of ten improvement gets
you about 19 decimal digits in the 2^512..2^1024 range.

 See above, I don't know what you did wrong.  However the factor of 10
gets you ten digits sounds like ppmpqs.  Since NFS has only been used
in special case factorings AFAIK, ppmpqs numbers are worth paying
attention to (ppmpqs was used for the RSA-429 challenge).

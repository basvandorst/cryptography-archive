Its been done.


Check out "A cryptogrpahic library for the Motorola DSP56000", by Dusse' and
Kaliski, _Advances in Cryptology--EUROCRYPT 90 (vol 473, Lectures in Computer
Science)_, pp230-244.


This paper describes an implementation of RSA on the Motorola DSP56000 chip.
An interesting read.



Hope this helps,

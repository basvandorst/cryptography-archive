Increasing the key length will fend off faster computers which operate in 
the conventional Von-Neumann way.  It may be possible, using quantum 
mechanics, to perform a large number of calculations simultaneously using 
quantum superposition.  This might permit the solution of hard problems 
by performing an exhaustive search in a non-deterministic way.  

I consider such a breakthrough far less likely than the discovery of a 
method of factoring in polynomial time on conventional computers.  It is 
much like the discovery that non-locality in quantum mechanics could not 
be used to transmit information backwards in time, despite some 
belief to the contrary a while back.  It may be the case that quantum 
mechanical superposition cannot be used for any practical method of 
parallel computing.

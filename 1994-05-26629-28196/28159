If there are any doubts about Sternlight's statist mentality, read the 
above. 

In his eagerness to contradict each and every every statement that his 
critics make, he revealed his heart and soul.

How can it be, then, that individual persons are not trustworthy, but 
when formed together they become trustworthy?

It's not "hilarious," even if that were a fair picture. Clipper, were it 
implemented (and by the folks that DS longs after), is an instrument of 
the state. This means it affects thousands, millions in an intrusive and 
coersive manner. "'[O]ne or two people _can_ be bribed'" with harmful 
results to ordinary people--those untrustworthy fools that Sternlight 
sneers at. 

But "one or two people with PGP" are just one or two people. That's all. 
Just people doing what people do and not doing harm. Not ganging together 
for Reasons of State, for which reasons the most harm, terror, 
destruction, and you name it, have happened and continue still.

Cheers,

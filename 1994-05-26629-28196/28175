I am looking for a copy of the source code to crackerjack v1.4 to
port it to an alpha machine, the docs give a bbs out of the US
to contact the author, I was hoping that someone already
had the source and could share it, or knew how I could contact
the author by internet.  I also had some ideas on changing
the code, so if anyone has the source I would echo back whatever
I improved/changed/screwed-up to you.
 
Thanks,
Rodg

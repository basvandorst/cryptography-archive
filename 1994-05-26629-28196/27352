The md5 hash function *can* be freely exported.  However, if your
encryption system is very good, it *can't* be exported, regardless of
whether it is built from md5 or from a pseudo-random number generator.

Using md5 to create a bitstream would be MUCH more secure than almost
any pseudo random number generator.

Since all you are doing is XORing the bitstream with the plaintext,
you can never re-use a key.  To get around this problem, you can
switch to the "Encryption from Hash Functions" method that I proposed
on sci.crypt a couple months ago.

you can probably find v2.6 in that same place you found 2.5. or get it 
from MIT itself.

hey, don't you think alt.security.pgp is a better place to take *all* the 
pgp discussions? and leave sci.crypt to the science of cryptology and 
free from all the B.S. that surrounds PGP (that ever so keen freeware 
product).

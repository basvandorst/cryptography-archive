It's traditionally a block of nulls. An easy way to isolate your
UNIX passwords from everyone else's and foil Crack would be to patch
in some other value.

All of the Unices I have looked at are the same, which does not prove
they all are. Windows NT uses a similar method, but with a non-null
string (I know what it is but am not telling :-).

This is a categorical and demonstrable error of fact. David Sternlight
made a series of unsubstantiated allegations about CPSR, including
an unrecanted claim that the petition responses were a hoax. He at
various times implied lack of integrity, stupidity, and other denigrating
terms. That David Sternlight didn't impute motives or "call names" 
is hardly evidence of his unrecanted smears, which he seems to again
want to resurrect. Although, as previous posts have shown, DS is
quite wrong in his claim that he didn't impute motives.

Sternlight has learned nothing from the recent brouhaha with CPSR.
New readers might not be aware that his own "methodology" was so
thoroughly crititized that it's stunning that DS can, presumably
in seriousness, call CPSR's methodology "sloppy." Sternlight fails to
understand that the CPSR "methodology" (as explained ad nauseam on the
nets) was far sounder than hard-copy petitions. Sternlight also
demonstrates considerable hubris when claiming that CPSR tried to
"brazen it out." How did they do this?  Sternlight, in an SSQ, will
obvious claim that he meant nothing of motive or character in such
terminology. But, "brazen it out" denotes a conscious attempt to 
distort, fudge, or otherwise intentionally engage in actions that 
conceal.  Perhaps Sternlight, the stickler for language, could provide
some evidence of CPSR actions that reflect "brazening it out?"
As I recall, none from CPSR posted in this thread or elsewhere.

Sternlight doesn't call names above. He smears by innuendo.

Sternlight has resumed his reprehensible and to date undemonstrated
allegations against CPSR. New readers unfamiliar with the degree to which
Sternlight was thoroughly humiliated in the previous incarnation of this
thread might assume there is some subtance to his claims. There is none.
Sternlight's criticisms have been overwhelmingly shown to be invalid
and his logic and "method" unreliable. His criticisms of CPSR have been
intellectually barbaric (as previous posts have shown), and the truth
quotient of his claims is rather scant.

Sternlight owes CPSR an apology for his previous smears against CPSR.
For this later round he should be ashamed.

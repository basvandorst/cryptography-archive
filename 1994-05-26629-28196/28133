Back by popular demand ;) the TRUTH about Dr. DS...

:The "proClipper squad" needs to have
:some light shed upon them. You'll please excuse me for posting anonymously,
:but when dealing with these characters, you have to be very careful.

:Carrol Quigley (of Georgetown) wrote a lengthy volume entitled 
:"Tragedy and Hope" detailing the activities of said organization.
:I'll refer you back to William J. Clinton's inaugural address, where he
:praised Prof. Quigley for the inspiration given to him while a student
:at Georgetown. 

ELITISM BEATS STRONGLY IN THE HEARTS OF SOME...USUALLY IN THE HEARTS OF
THOSE TRYING TO GIVE MORE CONTROL TO GOVERNMENT.

:This is not a technical issue, it is a political issue. It is about
:POWER and CONTROL, and who has it.
:Stern(dark) (Dr. DS) sees himself as a Captain? Major? Colonel? in the 
                   "NEW WORLD ORDER". 
     REMEMBER THAT PHRASE (AND THOSE WHO SAY/SAID IT)!!!

:There is no use in arguing with him. He can have no other position
:regardless of the logic you throw at him. He is distracting everyone
from the real issues here. IGNORE HIM!

         SPEND YOUR TIME EDUCATING THE UNINFORMED, 
         THIS IS WHERE THE BATTLE MUST BE WON!!

If I were to publish a report, but not tell anyone that I did, so that
very few people knew it EVEN existed, does that not meet the above
definitions? 
There are SO MANY .edu extensions on the postings to these newgroups, I 
hoped that some of you might ACTUALLY be intelligent. Speaks wonders
for the American "EDUCATIONAL" system!

HOW MANY OF YOU IN THE "PUBLIC" KNOW WHAT THE CFR IS? 
DID YOU KNOW THEY PUBLISH AN ANNUAL REPORT? (A report where they 
gloat about their positions of power, and slap each other on the back
about what a great job they are doing-(read: Bosnia, Somolia, Vietnam,
Korea, repealing the gold standard, let's not forget the EPA)-CONTROL.
Do you know that there are over **118** members of the CFR currently in
very high positions in government? That the senior level positions of
the State Dept. (Secretary, Asst. Secretary(s), Ambassadors, etc.) are
dominated by members of the CFR? 
What about the media, if this were true, surely the media would tell us.
WRONG. Senior editors, reporters, and even publishers and owners of the
major media are also members. New York Times, Washington Post, LA Times,
Newsweek, Wall Street Journal, ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN. Who's left? 
Why that sounds like one of those crazy "conspiracy" theories....we 
all are "enlightened" enough to know that is nonsense, so 
WHY BOTHER investigating it to see if it is true?
THAT'S EXACTLY THE RESPONE THEY WANT. Dismiss it, don't TROUBLE yourself
by actually doing some research into the FACTS, finding the TRUTH.
Let David Sternlight tell you a "good-night" story, and everything will
be better tomorrow. Just go to sleep now. THEY know what's best for you.

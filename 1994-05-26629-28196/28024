If you read a public newsgroup, it turns out what you see is posts to
public newsgroups; this phenomenon has mystified sages through the
ages, but it says nothing at all about what other uses there might be,
and which are the "major purposes of public key crypto."  Indeed, I'd
just as soon people didn't routinely sign their postings.

Email between truested friends is, in fact, what I understood to be
the major purpose of public key crypto.  And key certification aside,
I plan to form my own opinions about the actual trustworthyness of the
real individuals involved before sharing my secrets (not everyone gets
*my* chocolate chip cookie recipe, let me tell you!).

On the other hand, public commerce, such as email-order catalogs,
would need some kind of high-bandwidth certification of strangers,
which web-of-trust is just *not* going to cover, and which central
certification authorities could manage very well.  And after all, if
we're just buying off-the-shelf chocolate chip cookies, I can live
with that.

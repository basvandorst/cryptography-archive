The note specifying the March 16, 1994 version of the RSAREF 2.0 
licence agreement is interesting. In particular, this version doesn't 
have the definition of "published interface" which was put in to 
later versions of the licence agreement such as the version of April 
15, 1994. 

In particular, one could interpret the March 16, 1994 agreement as allowing
use of any functions which do not require modification of RSAREF code.
Consider the following bits of text extracted from the March 16 version:

}    d.   Prior permission from RSA in writing is required for any
}          modifications that access the Program through ways other
}          than the published Program interface or for modifications
}          to the Program interface. RSA will grant all reasonable
}          requests for permission to make such modifications.
} 7.   RSAREF is a non-commercial publication of cryptographic
}      techniques.

I have no connection with the folks releasing PGP 2.5. All this is just
speculation on my part.

Anyway, I look forward to hearing more about this.

David, I can think of three reasons that would explain your results:

1) KILL files.  You must realize that there are thousands of lurkers
with you in their KILL files.  You regularly post HOW-TO instructions
and must certainly be aware that most (many? some? :) readers don't
see articles by you (or even articles about you).  How did you
expect these people to see your article?  Is it inconceivable to
you that 10,000 lurkers (who oppose Clipper) would have you in
their KILL files.

2) Your article was not highly cross-posted or forwarded.  I never
saw your request until after you had claimed to only get 30 sigs.
The CPSR request, OTOH, showed up as far away as libernet (which
has a fidonet echo) and virtually every related newsgroup, often
reposted several times.  I never saw your request forwarded anywhere
(presumably because no one takes you too seriously and reason (1) above).

3) WHY should anyone send you a message?  I didn't.  I know that
by sending a message to CPSR I will be taken seriously and my
petition will go to the president.  Sending a message to you would
just inflate your bloated ego.  It was clear from the onset that
you sought to discredit the petition, so why should anyone who
opposes Clipper support your smear campaign?

PS: If CPSR was hoaxed, why didn't the cypherpunks just hoax you too?

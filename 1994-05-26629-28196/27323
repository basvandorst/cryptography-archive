I would suggest using the cipher with a single key in CBC mode,
with a new initializing vector for each sector.  The vector
could be an encrypted form of the key+sector number or some such info.
Of course, you want to protect yourself from the effects of
disk defraggers.

You don't want to switch keys on every block--most ciphers 
are pretty slow at setting up keys, and BLOWFISH is no
exception.

You guys are so easy.  

Do you really think D.S. believes what he writes?  Don't you notice
some difference between the thought that goes into his style and the
intelligence of the content?

D.S. likes to generate news traffic and he's good at doing it.  He
throws out some flame bait and the world talks about him.  You are
arguing with someone who's goal is to generate more argument.

We don't have to do anything to shut him or anyone else up.  If
someone posts something so stupid no one is going to believe it, just
ignore it.  If you must talk about the author, do so in the third
person.  If you must respond to the author, just write something like:
"Be sure and write to the President so he'll know CPSR is a bunch of
lying communists."

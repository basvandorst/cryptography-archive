You still don't get it, do you.

Web-of-trust is a GENERALIZATION of the hierarchical trust model.

It allows arbitrary directed graphs, not just rooted trees.

Any hierarchical trust system can also be seen as a web-of-trust system.
But the converse is not true. Web-of-trust allows multiply connected
graphs, where there is no single point of failure for the entire system.

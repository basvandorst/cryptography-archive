This week's science news has a good general article on quantum computing.

A researcher has now PROVEN that if a quantum computer can be built, 
factoring would be intrinsically easy using such a machine.

Several researchers are working to develop a quantum based computer,
but all are believed to be several years away from a hardware
implementation.

My question is - could a quantum computer be simulated in software?

If so, would factoring be intrinsically easy on the simulated
computer?

   Does anyone know whether the BBS generator is patented, and if so,
by whom the patents are held?
 
   The BBS generator is basically:
 
   Find p,q such that both are congruent to 3 modulo 4.
   Choose x, relatively prime to p*q.  Let n = p*q.
   x_0 = x**2 mod n
   x_i = (x_i-1)**2 mod n
   The output is the low-order bit of x_i.

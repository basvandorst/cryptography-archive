I caught the tail end of a radio interview this evening, between Michael
Enright of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's "As It Happens," and
Dr. Arian Lindstrah (sp?).  Apparently, Dr. Lindstrah was being
interviewed due to his successful factoring of the RSA-129 challenge
published in Scientific American in 1977.

The funny thing is, I haven't seen any official annoucements on this;
usually, one expects to see something like this on the net before it
make it to the mass media.  Does anyone have any details?

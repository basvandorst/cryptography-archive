   Within web-of-trust, you can certainly include any number of hierarcies.
Find a private detective willing to do the work, and an insurance company
willing to set up a bonding service.  Guarantee that the person this
public key was issued to is indeed the name on the certificate, and do a
background check on them, including credit reports, checking at their
job and schools, checking with their family, maybe checking their finger-
prints, etc.  When you're sure enough, use one of the threshhold
signing schemes to allow maybe 3 out of the 5 trusted people at the
business to agree in order to sign the certificate.

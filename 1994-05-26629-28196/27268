I think there are practical answers to code book cryptanalysis (that is,
compiling dictionaries of paired plaintext-ciphertext blocks).  There are
two methods I know of:
1.  indexing.  Consider the keystream as indefinitely long.  We count it.
Each correspondent has his own range of keystream, and never repeats any
of it.  Messages are indexed.  You can even include the index as part of
the message header.
2.  "whitening".  I think I got this term form Meyer and Matyas book
Cryptography.   You use an ICV that you "fold" into
the encryption, just like you do in the DES.  This is very necessary in
the DES precisely because of the code book attacks.

In short, I don't think that a 32-bit block is ipso facto disqualified.

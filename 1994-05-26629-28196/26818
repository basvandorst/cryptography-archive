I know it can be done with an out of core solver.  Solving a 2G matrix on
a 1G machine is feasable, doing so with a 4G matrix becomes problematical,
doing so with a 8G matrix is out of the question (it can be done but will
take an enormous amount of time).  Out of core solvers only allow matrices
greater by a constant factor.

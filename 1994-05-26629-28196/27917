Isn't this all a little ridiculous?
 
Usefulness is in the eye of the user.  If I want to talk to _anybody_ using
any system at all, I have to identify myself to that person's satisfaction
(including none-required, right? right.)  If I want to enter into a contract
with David Sternlight, I have to satisfy his requirements.  If he only trusts
XYZco, nothing else will do.  There is no possible argument against his
requiring this.
 
Anybody else that doesn't trust XYZco will have other requirements.  Maybe
there will be a notary-public-key-signer somewhere, and you can go to any
notary public and perform their rituals for establishing id.  It's all
completely arbitrary.  Nobody can force -- no one has any right to expect --
Mr. Sternlight to accept any identification he doesn't want to.
 
Same with the phone company, or your bank.
 
Just what, exactly, is the problem here?
 
Jeez.
 
Jim

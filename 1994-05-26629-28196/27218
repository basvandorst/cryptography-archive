The way "it is currently done" by you folk.  You aren't proving that ANYTHING
is prime, just that a bunch of other numbers are composite.  If you look into
how to ACTUALLY prove that a number is prime, I think that you'll find that
you need to ACTUALLY get a bunch of factors of another number.  In other words,
to prove a number is prime, you need to factor (for instance, up to like 
the seventh root of) both p+1 and p-1.

Okay, my friend.  All positive integers can be written as the sum of at most
4 squares.  I give you a number.  You give me the squares.  I give you n.
Now give me the squares.  Existence.

Construct me the algebraic closure of a given field.  Construct me the Galois
group of a given field.

Constructive proofs are better, if you ask me.  But existence proofs are much
easier, and more common.  The reason that you see so many constructive proofs
is because (typically) some of the best people in the world have beat their
heads against the problem, and eventually, a construction is found.  Existence
usually comes before construction.

Sorry.  I prefaced this with "pedantry" because I was in math mode.  It isn't
random because it's generated by a deterministic algorithm.  The proper term
is pseudo-random.

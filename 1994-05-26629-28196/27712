I seem to be getting the impression that a quantum computer, if such a device
can be built, is something which can solve NP problems in polynomial time.

In other words, more powerful than a Turing machine, which is the computational
equivalent to ALL computers existing today.


IF this were true, then all current cryptographic algorithms would have to be
thrown out the window... however, the prospect of a nondeterministic computer
sounds QUITE dubious to me.  Is someone actually trying to BUILD this thing,
or is some prof somewhere merely engaging in wild, fanciful speculation.

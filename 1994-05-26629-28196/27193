WHY?

Perhaps its so that the trivial stuff and important stuff are not
easy to spot.  So 'interesting' stuff is not flagged by virtue of
its being encrypted with a big key.  And to make it costly to do any
fishing expeditions.  Governments like to 'fish', but if its costly,
they will fish only when a truly pressing need occurs, not whenver they
have a wild hair up their backside to look for 'incorrect' views or
politics.  And they do have a habit of doing just that.

If you think they are so disinterested, please tell us why they are
busting their butts to force a trapdoor chip down our throats, one that
will make 'fishing about' a trivial excercise - so they can even scan
encrypted stuff for keywords or phrases?

And if you think they don't do this, I got some real estate deals you
should be interested in.  What do they do with all those antenna farms
close to every satellite uplink, if not snooping?

Some of us read them just to be reminded of the Official Gov't position
on most matters.  He parrots them to a 'T'.  And occasionally respond
when we spot an obvious gaffe.

I don't want to trigger yet another flame war with an innocent message, but
it seems to me that performance improvement might mean speedup, but not
longer keys. Longer keys would probably be interpreted as an extension of
the feature set, which requires advance written permission from RSADSI under
the license.

But if you want the facts, check with them, rather than speculating or going
with my opinion.

I've seen a few articles over the years about cryptographic toys, the
Captain Midnight Code-O-Graph of 1949 for example.  I guess some of these
have become valuable collectors items.

Well while I was out shopping today I happened to see "Spymaster (tm)
Code Kit" copyright 1989 by Natural Science Industries, Ltd. of
Far Rockaway, NY. (made in China).  So of course I bought one; and since
its value as a Valuable Collectors' Item will be diminished if I break
the seals I haven't decided whether to open the box yet. :-)

Anyway, it says it has four different codes and things for two people.

Combination Cypher: uses stencils with cut-out circles and a special
   sequence of numbers

Code Watch: can be used in different ways.  Just make sure your fellow spy
   knows which one you've chosen!

Scytale Staff: turns your message into gibberish - until the receiver winds
   it around _his_ scytale staff

Enigma Code: based on the famous code used during the last war - incredibly
   difficult for anyone to break.

Let's say a message is encrypted once with the IDEA encryption algorithm and
a key K1. The resultant encrypted message is encrypted a second time with a
different key K2.  Does there exist a key K3 with which the result of the 
second encryption step can be decrypted?

How would one show this?

Thanks,

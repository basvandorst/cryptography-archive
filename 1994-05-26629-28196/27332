 ARS> Is there an easy way to bypass WP5.1's password protection or to

 ARS> A former employee of our company left some files on our hard disk

 ARS> If you know how we might accomplish this, please contact me at:  
 ARS> savener@utxsvs.cc.utexas.edu.

 ARS> Thank you.

You can find the programs needed to do this on the "Tool Shop BBS" at
213-851-2393 or if you know  ASM  you can use a disk editor.

Steve is correct; I apologize for the misinformation.  From the April '94
issue of the NSA's Information Systems Security Products and Services
Catalogue Supplement, page I-5:

"Type-1 products may be used to secure classified information and are
handled as Controlled Cryptographic Items (CCI).... Type-2 products
may be used to secure only certain unclassified Government information."

Thanks for pointing out my error, Steve.

Cheers,
Phil

Sternlight doesn't get it. His previous anti-CPSR smears were demolished
and it was almost embarrassing to see Sternight waffle as the refutation
overwhelmed him. It's hardly necessary to reproduce the numerous posts
from a few months ago simply because Sternlight's memory seems to be failing.

Sternlight has now shifted from previously claiming "no checks" to 
no "careful checks." As usual, when Sternlight makes an unambiguous
claim and it's challenged, he shifts the terrain crying "smoke and
mirrors," denying that he ever said the words people attribute to him
(until reposts of his words come back to haunt him), or claiming that
those who cricitize him are smearing, name-calling, or evading issues.

Calling your character into question on the basis of demonstrable
errors of fact and logic may be a mistake. I apologize if the source of
such egregious posts is caused by medical or pharmaceutical influences
instead.

Sternlight owes CPSR an apology for his previous smears against CPSR
which he repeated even in the face of strong counter-evidence.

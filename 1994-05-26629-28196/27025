If this were basketball, the score would be CPSR 20,000, Sternlight 35

That Sternlight still boasts of his "experiment," a method that left
Sternlight's intellectual competence in shambles after critique here,
suggests that he still doesn't know the score.

It is precisely because many of us hold intellectual integrity higher
than political ideology that we see Sternlight in serious trouble.
That he has not yet apologized to CPSR for his continued defamation
raises serious questions about his honor.

Pointing out the truth is no smear.

   I am currently working on building a security API for a desktop

   need to protect the contents of the video from intruders and tapping, I need
   to scramble or encrypt the video. Which is more feasible? Could anyone help
   me by suggesting a FTP site from which I can get a free copy of scrambling
   software to try. Better still if source is available.

You have two basic choices in digital systems:
- get something with known high-quality strong cryptography,
  which your government might object to even more strongly than mine :-), 
  and which will require some computing capacity
  (not very expensive by computer standards, though perhaps a bit
  expensive for inexpensive mass-market products), or
- do something fast, inexpensive, and easily broken,
  which won't provide any real security and may still upset some governments.

- (Analog systems also let you do weak analog scrambling, but that's
  mainly useful if you aren't converting the signal to digital where you
  can use strong crypto.)

Please choose strong cryptographic techniques.  If you want a good
book on practical cryptography, I recommend Bruce Schneier's book
"Applied Cryptography", ISBN 0-471-59756-2.

The US government's Data Encryption Standard, DES, is old, and is not
quite strong enough to protect against serious attacks, but triple-DES
(a variant on using it three times with different keys) is fine,
or the IDEA algorithm (patented by Ascom-Tech from Switzerland) is
probably stronger.  Both of these algorithms require you to exchange a
secret key to use for your communication.  They're really designed for
encrypting blocks of data (e.g. 64 bits), but a video system probably
generates data fast enough that the delay involved is small.

The best ways to exchange
keys are to use public-key techniques, such as RSA or Diffie-Hellman.
RSA is good for both key-exchange and digital signatures, but requires
you to communicate your public keys to each other in a way that you
can be sure that nobody has given you a fake key.  This is easy enough
to validate if you have a reliable communciation path or are willing
to do other pre-arrangement, but it's a bit complicated for most people.

Diffie-Hellman key exchange is very easy to use, does not require
pre-arrangement, and is normally used to establish a different key for
each session, but also has the weakness that an active wiretapper can
trick both people in a conversation into using the wiretapper's key.
There are ways to prevent this, using RSA digital signatures or by
reading the public-key parts to each other over the telephone, etc.

Diffie-Hellman and RSA are both patented in the US and maybe Canada by
Public Key Partners; you can contact their president at jim@rsa.com .
They're not patented in the rest of the world.

Many crypto programs are available for ftp from ftp.funet.fi .
A good package that demonstrates the use of IDEA and RSA is the
PGP Pretty Good Privacy package, available on many FTP sites.
It's large and complex, since it's trying to solve many problems
of key distribution and convenience, but the code is available.
A good simple software system which demonstrates and explains how to
use DES and RSA (and Diffie-Hellman, in the new version), is RSAREF,
from RSA / Public Key Partners, but they don't allow it to be exported
from the US and Canada.  You might be able to find a copy at some FTP
site anyway.

"not ideal"? It's near-unworkable. and what does that make those who use it
to sign public posts?

We badly need something better. This isn't an argument against PGP, but one
pointing out the need to either improve its capabilities in this area or use
something else for authenticating public posts. There are several good
alternatives for the latter, which work fine now.

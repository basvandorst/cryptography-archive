The other part it relies upon is the ability to generate large primes,
currently done by testing large numbers for compositeness.  Hence RSA
depends both upon having existence proofs, and not having constructive
existence proofs, of non-trivial factors.

Problems with non-constructive existence proofs fascinate me.  Would you
provide some examples, please?  Is it markedly easier to demonstrate that a
map has a 3-colouring than to exhibit such a colouring?  Is it easier to
prove that a graph has a Hamiltonian cycle than to produce such a cycle?

I said:

                      ^^^

Would you explain this, please?  For example, does PGP not choose a random
IDEA key for each message (excluding any weak keys, naturally)?

Later,
Rujith.

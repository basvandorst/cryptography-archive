RSA is not inherently stronger than IDEA or block ciphers in general.
A given public key algorithm (of which RSA is one) may be weaker than
a good, strong block cipher algorithm.  The PGP docs do talk about this,
better than I can.  In any event, PGP uses IDEA for speed.  Block ciphers
in general are much faster to run than RSA since exponentiation of large
(1000 bit) numbers is much slower than shift, multiply, etc. on small
numbers.

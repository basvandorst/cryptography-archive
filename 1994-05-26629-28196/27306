It should be: Yes, and you are frightening. I'm glad he didn't try to latch
on to the "conservative" label, he would then be a "liar" as well.

David Sternlight has done it again. He tries to discredit-not the content 
of a post-but the poster, and NOW even the procedure that was used to post.
(He was the one who changed the subject of the "proClipper squad" thread)
There is just one little issue being (intentionally?) overlooked, that is
there is a difference between opinion and fact. The debate about posting
opinions anonymously can rage on, but a FACT is a FACT, and it makes no
difference if it was posted anonymously or not. Facts can be checked. If you
would rather not believe the anonymous post, you are free (for now) to
check the facts yourself. There is no relevance to the method used to post
the facts. The TRUTH is, and will always be, TRUE. 
THE ORIGINAL POST: proClipper squad CONTAINED FACTS. It contained membership
information for a certain New York-based organization. 
And, before you attack the use of certain words (e.g. clandestine), I
suggest you get a good dictionary, and look up the word, then THINK
about what it means. 
Perhaps you "enlightened" individuals are not omniscient after all.

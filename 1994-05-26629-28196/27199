Depends on what size key you use.  A 384-bit key is a toy--anyone determined
enough to break it can.  It will keep your big brother out, but a determined
adversary will laugh at a 384-bit key.

A 1024 bit key, on the other hand, would be difficult for anyone to break.
Certain groups, such as the NSA, MIGHT be able to do it, but it would cost them
a lot of time and $$$$$$.

Oh, really?

Which information do they leak?  They give you a modulus to factor, I'll agree.
But factoring a 1024-bit modulus is, shall we say, NOT a trivial problem.

This is the major problem right now with public key cryptography.  However, 
this problem is a topic of much research, and performance increases are being
reported all the time.

Again, why is RSA so bad?  Until someone comes out with a tractable factoring
algorithm (i.e. polynomial with respect to the number of bits in the modulus),
or shows another way to crack RSA in reasonable time, the advantage is always
to the crpytographer.  Doubling the key length makes the cryptanalysts job
much harder by orders of magnitude.

Convince me that public key is weak.

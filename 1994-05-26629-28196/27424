Piece of cake.  Use some public key system.  C has published its public
key, and S has a copy.  When a connection is made, S provides a unique
number or string, and passes it to C saying 'here, sign this with your
public key and give it back to me'.  C does so, and S checks the
signature against C's public key.  Voila!

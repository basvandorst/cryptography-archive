Is this a question  about an elegant algorithm, or something to use in
practise ?
In practise it's easy. Take any encryption method that withstands a
known plaintext attack (I think most modern ones do like DES IDEA ..)
say A and B are the keys. M is the plaintext. 
Create a random key C.
send the following message:
C(M),A(C),B(C)

Axel or Berta can decode either A(C) or B(C) an in a second step C(M).

The method is as save as the primary encryption method.(In terms
of resisting a known plaintext attack), but not very elegant.

Is there any mathematical concept which would do the job in
a more interresting way?

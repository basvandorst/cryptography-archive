Quotes, please. I said there was no point in debating technical aspects we
knew nothing about until the committee set up to examine and report on those
matters did so. Not only did I NOT say there was no point in general debate,
I participated in it. Either my recollection is incomplete or your assertion
is faulty.

The whole tone of your message suggests your comments are prejudiced or
juvenile in this matter. "gang of 5 (oops" indeed.

   PGP, and web-of-trust generally has no such capability. What's more it
   cannot have, unless there's some standard certifier who signs everyone's
   keys, and which everyone can have the key for in his file.

Sounds like a business opportunity for you, David.  Establish a
protocol for verifying identify, and sign the keys using your personal
signature.  If people trust you and your protocol, they'll be willing
to pay for your signature on a key.

   If that ever happens, it will be a crude and less secure version of
   the present PEM heirarchy, which has strict standards for giving
   and receiving certificates and even protecting the certifier
   mechanism in hardware boxes, trust or no.

You ignore the basis of security in the first place, which is trust.

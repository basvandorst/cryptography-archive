Hello all,

I need to find an implementation of FEAL I can use in a commercial
product.  I already have an implementation that was distributed at
the Crypto'91 conference.  It is marked "Copyright (c) 1991, NNT"
where NTT is the japanese telecommunication company.

I'd like to find either:

   someone at NTT who can say: it's all right, you can use that program
   some other implementation of FEAL

If anyone can help me, in any way... please do!  I don't know where
to begin.

Thanks in advance.

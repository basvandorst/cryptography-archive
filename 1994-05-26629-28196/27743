I downloaded the PGP2.3 source from netcom.com from the directory pub/qwerty.
I also downloaded the hqx utility.  When I hqx the source code, I get the
message "CRC error" and "file damaged."  The PGP program uncompresses without
a problem.  Anyone seen this?

Is there a better place to download the source code from?

Thanks,
Bob

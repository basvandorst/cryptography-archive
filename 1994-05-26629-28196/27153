One posts under the name David Sternlight.

And some, like yourself, though technically ignorant *also* need vast
improvements in their interpersonal skills.

In a group with several thousand readers you're bound to get a few nutters.
Like attracts like, and the nutters gravitate towards you like flies to
shit.

Tough fucking titty.  The world does *not* owe you a living, or anything
else.  When you ask a question you are asking for people to spend *valuable*
time doing you a *favour* with no hope of a return on their investment -
something you clearly do not deserve.

> I think your position to be incredibly arrogant

But not half so arrogant as your own position (which is head firmly stuck
up arse).

What a fucking nerve.  What an incredible cheek.  What a complete and utter
fuckwit.  When someone, who is not one of your students, or anyone else to
whom you owe any debt *whatsoever* asks you a complex question so *badly*
specified that it is *impossible* to give a sensible answer, then you can
choose to either give as much information as possible to let him plug in his
own assumptions and work it out for himself (if he is capable, which you
clearly are not) or you can decline to answer at all.  There is no
obligation upon anyone to supply Sternlight with answers of *any* kind, let
alone the ones that he would like, yet he complains because someone spent 15
minutes trying to give the best answer possible to an impossible question.

This guy is a dork.  An ultra-maroon.  A real fuckwit.  And arrogant to
boot.  Not to mention a complete waste of bandwidth.

You fucking twat.  Usenet is an *open* group.  If someone wants to give
an answer you don't like, they will and there's bugger all you can do to
stop them - other people reading the group are grateful for such nuggets of
information even if you aren't.  If you don't like the answer then don't
fucking read it.  At the very least don't complain because someone made an
attempt to give you an answer even though you are too fucking clueless to
understand it.  Put the whole fucking world in your killfile and disappear
up your own arse.

I expect there are quite a few experts out there who already do precisely
that in response to any question you ask.  I wouldn't tell you the fucking
time if you were late for your own hanging (upon reflection, I might well
give you an answer to that question, but that's the only one I'd answer).

Not the rest of humanity, just you.  You poor, sorry excuse for a human
being.  If they treat you with arrogance and superciliousness then it's about
ten times better than you deserve.

You speak as a deluded fuckwit who *thinks* he has the same IQ range.

You can lead a Sternlight to education, but you can't make him think.

They wasted their money.  In a *big* way.  They could have just set fire
to several hundred dollar bills and then they'd have some ashes to put
on their plants.  Or they could have hired a thug to beat thems up - at
least they'd feel better when it stopped.

I have been informed by private mail that this is a scam to invite
mailbombing, and that mail to this poster is forwarded to one of the
developers of Mosaic. If this is true, it is yet another good
reason not to mailbomb. Others are:
  It is a violation of Acceptable Use Policy,
  It can hurt other users on the posting host,
  It wastes bandwidth.

Do what I did: send gripemail (quoting the post) to root and
postmaster on that host, and to the technical and admin. contacts
for the domain; you can get the last 2 addresses from
"whois 'domain shadow.net'".

Not a net.policeman, though I used to play one on my radio program.

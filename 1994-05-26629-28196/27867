Subject: I have 800 abstracts to post?

I have been collecting abstracts for cryptography papers for some time
now. I have a TeX file with abstract for just over 800 papers, books,
and technical reports dealing with cryptologic items. Most of them
have full abstracts. Currently it only covers the 1980s.

It is hoped this will be a useful reference for others in the field.

The file gives almost 150 pages when printed using TeX on A4 paper.
The file is 522125 bytes.

1. Should I post this to sci.crypt (or is it too large)?
2. Does anyone know a suitable place to upload the file?
3. Does anyone want me to mail it to them?

(Note: You can use/read the file perfectly well without TeX as it is
just ascii with a few formatting commands).

I said no such thing. AFTER the public debate, and lots of hearings, and
lots of data, the government decided to go ahead. AT THAT POINT I said I
thought it was a done deal and further yammering was futile.

That's quite different from saying there shouldn't have been a debate in the
first place. There was, you guys lost, and now we are seeing what used to be
called, in elementary school, "sore losers."

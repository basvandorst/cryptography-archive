Such as radioactive decay, cosmic ray detection, diode noise,
crystal clock jitter, bingo cage, dice, coins, roulette wheel?

How about just the size of the message?

Okay.  As in melt-down the disk?

Huh?  Obviously not a *one* time pad.  And conficts with (d).

See (e).

For pedantic purposes, I presume.

Don't see the relavanct to a one time pad.  This is useful
for keeping down telegraph charges, or exploring WW I vintage
cryptography.  If you're just trying to shorten the messages
(to keep the keylength requirements down), use a modern
compression algorithm.

I suppose this is in conjuntion with (h).

(l) is particularly good for OTP systems, if well written.
The others: no comment (important for user-interface issues,
but not for crypto issues).

This, with (g), (h), and (i) sounds like you're writeing a
intro-to-crypto program, not a one-time-pad system.

It sounds like a fine thing, as long as you take the term "one time pad"
off of it.  A one-time pad is an unweildy, ultra secure cryptographic
system.  Please do not use the term for "almost one time" pads, or other
cryptgraphic variants.

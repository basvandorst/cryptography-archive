Hi.  I'd like to get a technical description of PGP.  Does such a thing exist?
For example, I've heard it uses a very small public key (not sure why), that
it uses Fermat's little theorem for primality testing, etc, etc.  I'd like to
get the straight dope (w/o reading the code if possible: the code is, well,
Spartan).

I'd also like to know what MIT did (other than use RSAREF).  Did they take
full advantage of the RSAREF toolkit?

Thanks in advance.

DL

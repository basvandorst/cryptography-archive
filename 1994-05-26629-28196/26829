   General question:  How many bits of entropy are in a gramatically-
correct English sentence of 80 characters or less?
 
   The standard rate of entropy in English text is a little over 1 bit
per character.  However, this assumes that you're in the middle of the
text.  I'd guess that the first few characters carry a lot more infor-
mation, since they define what the next characters might be, build a
"dictionary" for the rest of the phrase, etc.  Rhyming couplets might
have a little more structure in the sense of finding rhymes, but they
aren't bound as tightly by the requirements that the words fit in the
"right" places....
 
    Do you model this as a list of 10 words?  (I tried this in a note
to JK Taber earlier.)  I thought it might be viewed as a markov-chain
kind of thing, ie there are 10 words, the first one is unconstrained,
the second is constrained by the first, the third, by the first two,
etc.  Coming up with reasonable ballpark figures for how much word
i constrains word i+1 isn't terribly easy, either.  "The" constrains
things less than "his" or "God."  How are new sentences constrained?
 
    I've always assumed that a long enough passphrase could be in simple
English, so long as it wasn't easily derived from a dictionary source, and
it really was long enough.  (This seems like a better alternative than
shocking nonsense for long passphrases, at least in some circumstances.)
Any comments?

I did.  I got rather sick of Davids claims that I (and people like me)
don't exist.  I posted a message suggesting that those that read the
crypto groups (and I did not post it to very many groups at all, in
addition the post was made at the start of a long weekend) take a
little time to tell Mr. Sternlight that there were people that did not
regularly post, but did read, and had formed an opinion. 

I did realize that I had made an error when I received a message from
Mr. Sternlight the next day saying that he had only received 10
messages.  I did point out to him that my original post had been made
on the saturday of a 3 day holiday weekend, and that perhaps an update
later in the week would be in order.  I did not expect it to cause
quite the amount of contention that it did, I know better now.  (BTW: I
enjoyed the philosophical analysis, what did the professor think)

In my case, while I find cryptography an interesting puzzle, I do not
have the time that keeping current enough to (and I know this isn't
usenet tradition) make informed posts would take. Thus I read, and
only post when I feel I can add to a discussion.  I think this is my
second post to any of the cryptographic groups and as I have
mentioned, I think the first post might have been improved by further
reflection.  (I do "keep current" in other areas, and contribute in
the forums on those topics.  In my case such study and posting is
reserved for typing injuries, and the commercial voice recognition
market, I suffer from the former, and thus need the latter, this
posting was untouched by human hands.)

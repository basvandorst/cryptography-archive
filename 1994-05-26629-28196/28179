An observation: Since the NSA is likely to have hundreds or thousands of
people working on cryptography, I assume they are likely to have several
level of title. In that case, "Senior Cryptographer" sounds like a
middlish techie, whereas the head honcho is likely to be something like
"Chief Cryptographer".

Of course, I know almost nothing about the NSA, how they are organized
and certainly nothing about Brian Snow or his job, so this is pure
speculation.

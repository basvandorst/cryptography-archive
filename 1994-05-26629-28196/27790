Responding halfway into the thread...

In the United States, it is my understanding that the PIN number can be
"checked" using some form of checksum..ie, add up all the digits of the
PIN and they match some portion of the data fields on the magstripe. So
all one needed to do was find a wimpy ATM machine and get a card reader
to make withdrawals.

A bank I used to use (and quit for this reason) had the EFT number itself
(the magic 13 digit number that identifies your account to any bank in
the world) encoded on it! With that little number, one could simply phone
the less scrupulous banks and transfer the money out.

I'm curious, how many banks, around the country, around the
world, "issue" PIN's to card holders?  This seems rather
ridiculous given today's security concerns.  When I got my ATM
card, I was led to a keypad that was enclosed so that only I
could see it and asked to punch in a 4 to 6 digit PIN.  That was
my PIN and I could go in and change it any time, which I have.

This seems reasonably secure to me.  Correlating PIN's and card
numbers and mailing PIN's with the card seem quite silly. 
What's going on?

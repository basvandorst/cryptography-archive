Hi,

I have some questions on which answers an article for a computer
magazin may depend, so PLEASE, answer them as soon as possible and
send the answers back via email. Thank you.

1) What is the time complexity formula for factoring RSA-numbers:

   -> exp((ln(n)**1/3) * (ln(ln(n))) ** 2/3)

   or

   -> O( exp( ln(n)^(1/3) * ln(ln(n))^(2/3) * ((64/9)^(1/3)+o(1))) )

2) How long would it have taken the NSA/DoD approx. to factor RSA-129
   with current computer resources they MIGHT have, and how long would
   it take them to factor 512, 768, 1024 bits (just to speculate) ?
   What machines do they use ? - How many Mips/Years they approx. have ?

3) How many times harder than RSA-129 would be 512 bits, 768bits,
   1024bits, etc ? - How long will X-Bit-Keys be secure (e.g. 512<X<8192) ?

4) What increase per year does computer-power have ? - Doubles per year ?

5) How many faster is 'gnfs' compared to ppmpqs used for RSA-129 ?

6) What machines do the best job for factoring RSA-numbers ?


Sorry, all these topics have been discusted in sci.crypt, but I saved
about 1,5 MB of text and even can't figure out which informations
are correct and which are not ...? - So, if anyone can draw the
ultimate conclusion and answer the above qestions, I would be
eternaly grateful :-)

 Regards, Pat !

P.S: Any additional information welcome, if you have anything you think
     I should mention, please let me know.

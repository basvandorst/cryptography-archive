We don't know that every possible method of breaking RSA is no faster
than factoring.

It does matter if you want to prove that RSA is secure.  If you know
that breaking RSA is equivalent to factoring, then it suffices to show
that factoring is hard.  If you don't know this (and we don't), then
you have to do something else.

In the clari.nb.govt  an article (<NB940520.15@clarinet.com>) reports that 
Maria Cantwell's (D-WA) amendment to the Export Administration Act
has cleared the House Foreign Affairs committee. 

The bill  would turn over responsibility for all non-military crypto  to the 
Commerce dept, and that most forms will be exportable without licensing.

For more information on the bill, HR3627, look for Cantwell at

	ftp://ftp.eff.org/pub/EFF/Policy/Legislation/Bills_by_sponsor
	
Presumably, this means the bill will proceed to a vote before the House.
(Question for US readers: does your rep's position on HR3627 match yours?)

I realize this does not quite meet the "charter" of sci.crypt, but since
it is relevant news, I hope you will forgive the intrusion. I have directed
followups to talk.politics.crypto

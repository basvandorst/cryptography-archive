Where did I say it was secret?  Where did John Grimes say it was secret?
John Grimes only asked you to publish a mail address for people to send
snail mail to.  As you did not publish such a thing it is not very
surprising that you did not get any response to that.

But for what reasons do you draw conclusions from #2 about the CPSR
response when #2 clearly asked lurkers to send you e-mail why they do
lurk?  Did you check that all responses to #2 where indeed signatories
to the CPSR petition?  Logically they need not be.  They may well have
been people that oppose the petition but did explain to you why they lurk.
Or do you assume that all lurkers are signatories?  I may note that I
would have responded (perhaps, when I had seen it) to #2 because normally
I am a lurker, but would not sign the CPSR petition (obvious, I am not a
citizen of the US).

Well, that is the normal stance taken by people who see something going
against what they wish.  What tests would you think are required for the
validation of a petition that has no legal basis?  Somewhere else you
mentioned return paths, but obviously those where validated.

There exists a Dutch proverb talking about kettles and black...

Interesting question, did Graham Toal respond to the CPSR request and
was it (if he did) invalidated?  ;-)

Why is such an assumption reasonable? The largest one built to date
is 1K procs. From what I understand from having talked to people at TM,
while it is theoretically possible to put together one with 16K nodes,
it would be difficult to build and maintain, and expensive. 

Further, one does not NEED the fast networking hardware to do factoring.
16000 SparcStations, hooked together by Ethernet would be a lot cheaper
[if you eliminate the monitors].

Please stop these "pie-in-the-sky" speculations. Please look at
the acquisition, support, and run-time costs of a 64K CM-5. We
are talking in the ballpark of $500million upfront, plus astronomical
maintenance costs. Look also at the MTBF for such a beast.

:"safe" lifetime of a 1024-bit RSA key, especially if we saw cascading

64K nodes would not suffice to do 1024 bits. One would need at least
2 x 10^7 nodes [yes, 20 MILLION] to do the job in any kind of reasonable
timeframe. Probably more.
 
At $5K per node, you are talking about $100 billion.

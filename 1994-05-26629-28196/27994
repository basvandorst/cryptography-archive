The fastest stream cipher around which has not yet been broken is SEAL by
Rogaway and Coppersmith. Wheeler's WAKE, an autokey system, is just as fast
and some versions of it might also suit.

Both these algorithms were among a dozen presented at our 1993 Cambridge
workshop on fast software encryption. The proceedings will be out in a few
weeks from Springer as Lecture Notes in Computer Science vol 809.

If you can't wait till then, the Danish contingent at the workshop was Peter
Landrock and Lars Knudsen from Aarhus - maybe you can get a copy of the
preproceedings at their library,

    There are stick-in-the-muds, and there are those willing to chase
the leading edge, in both the government and commercial sectors.  Most
of the research done at MITRE tries to stay as close as possible to
the leading edge, so that we know what state of the practice will be
when the systems contracted for today are shipped.

    I have participated on many risk assessments where the trade-offs
are between planning for next year's technology and the generation
after, or the one after that.  I remember one in particular, when we
just had 68040 sampling parts and preliminary spec.  The decision was
either go with a fast 68030 design, or plan based on the '040, but
expect to use the a derated '060.

  Intel's decision was reasonable, but I'm not sure "wise" is the
correct word.  More like a coin flip, and Intel probably saw their
decision as avoiding risk.  But I think they would have gotten into
RISC much sooner if they had.

   I think you are missing my point.  You can't get a significant
hardware edge right now for any amount of money.  Staying at the
leading edge is very expensive, but that is a cost of doing business
in this industry.  The cost of a one year lead on industry is probably
somewhere near the global R&D budget of the worldwide electronics and
computer industries EVERY YEAR, and it goes up steeply after that.
How much would you buy, even if you were the NSA?

   A five year edge in algorithms would cost a lot less, and have a lot
more benefit.

  The age of the supercomputer has come...and gone.  There was a time
when Seymour Cray could talk about building a supercomputer on a 3 or
4 inch wafer.  We have now reached the point where even WSI is
resulting in propagation delays that are too long.  On the other hand
desktop workstations long ago passed even second and third generation
supercomputers in performance.  To double the clock speed of a
computer or a chip requires shrinking it a linear factor of two, an
area factor of four, and a volume factor of eight.  And all chips
eventually cost five bucks.

  Yes the topic is interesting, but I didn't find much value in what
David had to say.  This industry just changes too damn fast.

  (Oh well, back to pushing the frontier...)

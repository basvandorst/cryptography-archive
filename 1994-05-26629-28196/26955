        What is it that leads you to suspect that IDEA is the
        'weakest chain in the link[sic]'?  I think you are making an
        unjustified assumption about the relative strengths of the
        algorithms involved.  The only reason we need to use RSA or
        similar at all is because of the public/private key
        mechanism, not necessarily because it represents ultimate
        security (whatever that might mean).

        For what it's worth, I found a PC program which encrypted
        files directly with RSA.  To encrypt a 32k text file, it took
        21 hours with a 300 digit key, on a 486DX33.  The program was
        called Iris and was part of a suite called PC-Crypto.

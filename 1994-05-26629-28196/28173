This is not to disagree with you, just to expand a bit.  There is a short
term, tactical benefit to cryptography, where as you say, all one needs is
to keep some message secret for an interval of time.  I suspect this kind
of tactical information is the primary interest of military intelligence.
But I think there is another kind of information, much longer term, that
I like to call strategic information.  Maybe years later, we break some
Russian codes that help us understand the intrigues in the Kremlin.  This
kind of info is useful indefinitely.  

Hah! for that matter maybe we break some codes that help us understand
the intrigues within the Beltway.  Think how nice that would be.

Sorry to follow my own post, but I wrote it at 2:00am
so now I have to fix the errors.

Of course that should be all permutations on S, not on P.

Oops: that's  1/(N*(N+1))/2 = (N+1)/2.

Readers who were following the math surely would have caught the
errors.  The proof is actually fairly simple.

If the generator is a random function we said that the expected cycle
length is on the order of the square root of N.  I'm not aware of a
closed form exact solution.  The calculation above gives us an exact
answer for expected cycle lengths in a random permutation.

It's been tried... notice how well it worked?  :-(  There is a continuing
flow of Usenetters both new and old through the affected groups, some of
whom find him amusing (for the first week or so) and others who are 
fundamentally opposed to "censorship" -- they may ignore him, but they'll
respond to others who quote him at great length.

Are you prepared to kill-file everyone who engages in debate with the
fellow, to the nth generation?  Which is what shunning calls for.
If his goal is to depopulate the entire group, this is a good way for
him to acheive it.

Nevertheless, it's worth a try. Check your kill file -- the only time 
you see his deathless prose should be when someone else quotes it to 
you.  Send them *polite* e-mail, once, asking them not to do that. 
If they agree, fine, if not, ^K them too and be firm about it.

So far, so good.  Here's the problem:
Repeat forever and ever until you stop seeing Sternlight or you stop
seeing the newsgroup, whichever comes first.  If the latter, unsubscribe
the group and watch for crossposts that were being filtered to start
appearing in other groups.  Repeat until you drop out of Usenet.

My main problem with the fellow is that he has no idea of what groups
are and are not appropriate for his opinions.  Followups redirected to 
ONE somewhat appropriate .talk group (HINT! HINT!)

Perhaps all the people capable of the kind of analysis that you are 
demanding have already been snapped up by the NSA and officially struck 
dumb.

Alternatively, maybe such persons are keeping quite because they don't 
want to come to the attention of the NSA or similar bodies.  Maybe even 
such persons are posting hand-waving estimates and generalities 
deliberately to disqualify themselves from such unwanted attention.

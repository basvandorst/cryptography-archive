What ARE you talking about? david@sternlight.com is my slip domain. The name
is about six or more months old and was suggested by my vendor, not me, when
I got my SLIP account. strnlght@netcom.com is my terminal account. That's
about a year old. Since getting my SLIP account my posts have automatically
carried the "reply to" david@sternlight.com line since it's my name, and
hence a lot easier for people to remember than strnlght.

So don't be a jerk when you don't know what you're talking about. 

David

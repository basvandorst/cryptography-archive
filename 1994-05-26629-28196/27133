I just posted on this issue and feel compelled to clarify my notion of
natural law.  Natural law is the standard of behavior which survives after
the historical dust settles.  Usually a violation of natural law requires
more energy than it is worth, even from the most selfish standpoint.  But
it is invariably a kind of narrow minded selfishness that leads one to
violate the natural law-- The aformentioned selfishness is abundant in the
current US Congress, an organization of sleazy dimwits by any standard.
The type of government that they are striving for is clearly unsustainable
over the short term, much less the long term, but they've had too many
martinis and sexual favors to understand this.  That is why it is appropriate
to refer to natural law when surveying the intentions of this most 
unnatural and perverse body of people.

As to your example, this requires some thought to understand.  If you kill
me and I'm definitely dead, that has little bearing on natural law, as
a specific instance is of limited significance against the universal standard
of natural law.  If life were completely obliterated in the natural course
of events in the universe, the natural law would have essentially decreed 
that "all matter has the right to be dead".  The natural law applies more
fundamentally to that which people are constited of, but if we are going
to discuss the relevance of the natural law to humanity, we are actually
assuming the long term survival of humanity.

Granted there may be more traditional definitions of natural law that are
of more limited scope than mine-- I am trying to convince readers without
proving it rigorously that natural law can be logically defined.

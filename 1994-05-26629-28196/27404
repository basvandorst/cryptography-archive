This is true, and perhaps even upheld to the strict letter of the law
in practice.  It doesn't take a genius though, as Bamford points out,
to know that the British GCHQ can do the monitoring and then pass the
intercept contents or summary second-hand.  This breaks no laws that I
am aware of and has the same practical effect as the NSA doing the
monitoring themselves.

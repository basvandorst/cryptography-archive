Yes, by xoring two cyphertexts which are known to be generated
with the same bit stream, you wind up with a pair of plaintexts
which are xored with each other.  With sufficient text it is
possible to simultaneously solve for the two plaintexts -- this
is basically a running-key cipher.

A way to make an entry into this type of cipher is to make an
assumption about a word in one of the texts, say `` the ''
(longer words give better results).  "Drag" this word across the
cipher; when something that looks like plaintext shows up you
make the tentative assumption that you found an occurrence of
the word in one of the texts.  From the plaintext that was
revealed you then guess at extensions forward and/or backward
from the found text, and test the guess at revealing more text
near your `` the '' guess.  Do this back and forth between the
texts, occasionally resorting to other probable words, and you
are quite likely to recover both texts.

Occasionally, especially toward the beginning of this process,
you will make some bad guesses; in this case you just need to
backtrack and try again further along the text, or with a
different probable word.

Ah --- of course, I meant a lower bound for uniform models of computation,
so your tables are a no-no...

That precisely summarizes my thoughts on the subject too.  Which is why
I found RSA, Inc.'s statement that a lower bound was more likely than a
breakthrough in factoring to be a bit hard to swallow.  Of course, if
factoring really *is* hard, then a breakthrough is impossible, so proving
a lower bound *is* more likely.  It's like a conditional probability ---
conditioned on the truth of factoring being hard (which RSA Inc would
like to believe), then yes indeed a lower bound proof is more likely...

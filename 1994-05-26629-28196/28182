Many thanks for this information. I'll have a good look at it tonight,
and into the week (I expect).  Thanks to the other helpful email
messages as well. I think I have everything necessary with one possible
exception (which I can probably determine from the program mentioned):

Did the rotors move BEFORE or AFTER the key was typed?  It makes a big
difference. I've mentally pictured the key moving a claw, that then
pulls the wheel (by spring) after key release. But then, this might
be backwards. The downward pressure on the key, might be more reliable
when all 3 (or 4) rotors were in a position to flip over.

Is there any way of detecting "back doors" in any crypto where the
algorithm is unknown?  It would seem that it would be trivial to
create algorithms with indetectable backdoors.  For example, consider
the following system: First off, the user's key is DES (for example)
encrypted using backdoor key#1.  Then each block of the message is DES
encrypted with backdoor key #2, then "wimpy-crypted" with the user's
key, then DES-encrypted with backdoor key#3.  In such a system, one who
knew backdoor keys #1 and #2 could derive the user's key with just one
known cryptext/plaintext pair (not even chosen).  Would there be any way
for a user of such a system to detect that the underlying encryption was
wimpy, short of knowing any two of the backdoor keys?  If the encryptions
on either wide of the wimpycrypt are any good, the wimpycrypt should not
visibly (to anyone not knowing how to break the "real encryptions") affect
the security of the system.

Alternatively, if one has a version of, say, PGP in object-only form, is
there any way to know that the "session-keys" have not been chosen so as
to specifically allow cryptotext-only attacks against the PRIVATE KEY?

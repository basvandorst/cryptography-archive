Gunnar S{mund Knutson <knutson@Lise.Unit.NO> wrote about people
ripping off ATM (cash) machines in Norway.

A few months ago there were some U.S. news stories on a very effective
"physical" attack on ATM security: crooks were setting up fake ATM
machines in shopping malls.  People would put in their card and type in
their PIN, and the machine would flash a little "This transaction can
not be completed" message and spit out the card.  The fake ATM would
just store the information on the card's mag stripe along with the PIN
and wait for the crooks to come back for the data.  Very effective --
especially because people expect computers to "screw up" and send them
packing -- they were probably glad "at least it didn't eat my card!"
Little did they know...

Oh yeah -- then there's the "brute force" physical attack -- some
people somewhere used a bulldozer or something and drove off with a
whole ATM machine!

Cheers,
Jeffrey

My inquiries are a bit like RSA-129 itself--different people here are
posting pieces of what I'm looking for, but we've not yet reached closure.

Here goes a question for Barry:

Given the assumptions in the last paragraph, leading to the conclusion that
it would have taken the machine in question two weeks to do RSA-129, how
long would it take for an IPRA key of 1024 bits to fall? 2048?

Comment:

Some here have suggested that THEIR 1024 bit key was probably  o.k. because
an adversary couldn't do everybody's keys. But we should be looking at the
point of maximum leverage on the part of a determined adversary, since
that's probably what such an adversary would do.

Corollary: Such a machine would likely be justified by the benefits of its
use--i.e. the direct and indirect gains from cracking any particular key, as
has been pointed out by another.

Corollary question: What would such a machine cost?

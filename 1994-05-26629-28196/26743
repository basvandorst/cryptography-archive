Someone told me (yeah, I know) that a new method of factoring had been 
discovered using chaos theory, that would be *much* faster than current 
methods. Apparently this method is now being tested for 
mathematical/physical flaws.

Questions: * Is this an age-old myth that I should know better than to 
             fall for?
           * Is it that anyone with a basic understanding of what Chaos 
             theory means (ie not me) knows that this is complete tosh?
           * Is this mere vapour-ware anyway?
           * Is this a possibility that has been doing the rounds?
Or, horrors:
           * Has anyone actually some confirmation that this has happened?

Apologies for my ignorance, which I am trying to correct.

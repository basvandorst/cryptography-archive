I, for one, would trust the regular anti-virus program writers who post on
comp.virus, more than I would trust my bank.  If no virii have leaked from
their collections, I would consider their computers secure, and they have
shown themselves trustworthy.

Besides, the RSADSI certification situation is more like trusting a private
statement of a lawyer who represents someone who may be your adversary.

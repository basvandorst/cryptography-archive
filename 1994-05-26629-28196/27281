Well, one easy way would be to convert the passphrase into a number,
using 2 decimal digits per character, and concatenating them all. A
300-digit or so number would result.

Then find the next prime above this number, using the standard
increment-and-test methods. (These are fairly fast, and you should
find a prime within about the first several hundred numbers tested.
Details in Schneier and elsewhere.)

This would convert you passphrase into a unique prime.

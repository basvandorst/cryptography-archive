Bernstein was the person at the Institute for Advanced Study who saw those
who came in on "open day" to present their ideas. It was a custom to have
this day once a week. It was his job to figure out which of them had serious
ideas worth pursuing and perhaps support, and which ones were nut cases. I
am reporting on what he told me about how he told the difference, not
claiming any ability along those lines for myself.

Perhaps you should read what other people say before opening your yap.

Negative. They may not monitor communication between two parties where
one of the parties is a U.S. citizen(s). Period. It doesn't matter where
the conversation took place. 
They are free to monitor any communication outside the U.S. that involves
non-citizens. Domestic communications are the domain of the FBI.


I certainly don't trust the government. I would like to note, however,
that NSA employees are required by law to sign a sworn statement every
6 months saying that they have not monitored any traffic where a U.S.
citizen is involved.

This requirement was put into place by Congess, following Watergate.

BTW.  NSA employees ARE allowed to say that they work for the NSA, despite
claims to the contrary. Go to any math conference. You will find NSA
employees with NSA written on their badges.

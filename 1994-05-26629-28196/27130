This is a gross distortion of the facts. You have been misled by a
propagandist. At no time did I say "the petition" was a hoax, but that, as
you say, CPSR could have received fake signatures. We know know that they
think they did, or at least rejected 10 percent as suspicious based on
acknowledgements bouncing. How many more they would have rejected had they
done the tests several suggested here, we can only imagine.

What fact?

This is, as far as CPSR has provided information, untrue. They did simple
acknowledgements and the obvious hoaxes--where the receipts bounced--were
rejected. They also claim to have done some vague other tests of an
unspecified kind with unspecified results. Wanna buy some swampland in
Florida?:

Several here have explained how the signatures could have been hoaxed in a
way to pass a simple acknowledgement test without bouncing the
acknowledgement. Thus their major test of validity is very weak, and they
have not specified to what extent, or in what detail they did other tests.

I'm amazed that someone as smart as their senior people should try to get
away with this latest press release.

No, it shows that malicious people will tell you lies and you will believe
them and repeat them. I'm not impressed. Neither should anyone else be.

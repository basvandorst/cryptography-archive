Yes, the stuff that was written about NP vs. NP-Complete is wrong, but
so are you!  :-)  It is perfectly plausible that a quantum computer
could solve problems strictly in NP, but not NP-Complete problems.
If NPC is the class of NP complete problems, then certainly NP-NPC-P
might be non-empty.  Problems that people usually refer to as probably
being in this class would be graph isomorphism and some people might
even claim that decision variants of factoring might be in this class.

	Being the person who first suggested the idea about the "mailing,"
I feel I need to clear up the revisionism that is going on here.  The 
original event that started it was your denial that CPSR had collected 
more than 10-12 signatures.  At that time you had also stated that there
was no way to verify the signatures.  When I posted the "Let's help Dave"
message it was in response to your posts at the time.  In this message I
proposed that you could post an address to the net in order to obtain 
physical signatures on paper and I offered to send mine as soon as you
did.  I had also suggested that you could obtain the services of a 
handwriting analyst if you felt the need to ascertain if every signature
was unique and genuine. OBTW the proposal still stands.  Being that you
have such a problem with "electronic" signatures why don,t you take 
the physical one's instead?

	Actually David, the intent was to have you put-up or shut-up.  Being
pragmatic about it, I must admit that in this I have not succeded.  In the
future David could you go a little easier on the adjectives, your use of 
them is starting to hurt my head.

	Part of the issue is the bogus signatures, the other is the validity
of your counter claims and the numbers that you attach to them.  For my money
physical signatures are hard to beat.

	Finally, a thought has occured to me, in your response to my message
just previous to this one (<jeg.767887782@aurora.jhuapl.edu>) you made an 
interesting statement to my request for the address to send a signature to.
I quote "The experiment that you suggested was done." and that there were
30 signatures,  but earlier in the current post I am responding to now, you
state "It was not I who asked people to tell you to mail me, but an 
infrequently posting bystander who had no reason to be in anyone's kill
file."  Well, I may not be no David Sternlight, but I think an explanation is due.

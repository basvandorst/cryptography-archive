In article <lou.768370394@cadence.com>,
Louis K. Scheffer <lou@Cadence.COM> wrote a further detailed analysis on
sources of uncertainty, clearly explaining the variables he considers, and
showing their effect.

Once more he had done a major service in placing the issues clearly and in
readily understandable terms. He has done the further service of showing how
the variables particularly affect useful output measures for users, and how
one can calibrate his analysis for situations of user concern. Instead of
arrogantly and lazily fobbing a user off with a careless and basically
irrelevant analysis about "orders of difficulty" he gives hard numbers of
direct use in understanding risks.

Excellent!

And to those arrogant fools here who have little better to do than attack
one for asking questions, and suggesting that a farmer who wants to eat the
occasional fish has to learn to fish for himself, the back of my hand.

We don't need you jerks to add noise, heat, and no light at all, as long as
we have people such as Scheffer who are willing to assist users in terms
useful to those users.

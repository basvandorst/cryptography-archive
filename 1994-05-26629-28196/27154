Unfortunately, my newsmailer won't let me include more text than I write.
This is unfortunate only because I would prefer to let Sternlight's text
speak for itself.  It's not worth working to get around.

Not after the fact, imbecile.

Get a dog to kick, dickhead.

You make me sick.  I can't believe that you honestly believe that it matters
if the "evil commies" find out that we have books about the fact that we
classify devices as TEMPEST secure.  bfd.

TEMPEST TEMPEST  shielding shielding

help me, help me, the pigs are kicking my door in as i speeeeaaaakkk!

get a grip, 1950's tight-sphinctered beady-eyed paranoid fuck face.

If you're talking about my statement that I got no responses, that was in
response to a request by another that people send me U.S. mail, in writing.
I stand by that.

If you're taking about something else, please be specific before throwing
"liar" around or people might think you're a jerk. Defamation is always a
bad idea, and one cannot engage in it with impunity on the net, as the
recent Australian verdict shows.

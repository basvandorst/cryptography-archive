They're not vulnerable in the sense that known plaintext lets you find the
key, but if you know most of the plaintext you might be able to find the
rest.  For example, suppose you have reason to believe that a message in a
particular key says "THE MAGIC WORDS ARE SQUEAMISH <foo>" for some unknown
<foo>.  Then you can throw a dictionary at it, encrypting each word in
place of <foo> with the public key and testing whether the result matches
the known ciphertext.  It's a limited-utility attack, but if there's an
RSA-250 with the format "THE MAGIC WORDS ARE <foo> <baz>" then it would be
faster to find out what they are by doing a search on the 5.5 * 10^10
pairs of words in web2 than to factor it.  You don't have the factors, but
depending on how the challenge is worded you might have the $100.

So what <is> the next RSA challenge after RSA-129, if any?

Bizzzzzt.  These machines have been in use for over 10 years doing
one-off and ten-off and onehundred-off sorts of chips...  "Worth their
while" is a relative sort of thing.

The biggest users are the semiconductor industry itself (naturally)
and the US Govt :)

But, just because the NSA is a generation ahead in computer technology
does not invalidate that some tasks are beyond forseeable computation.

DES lost it's usability years ago (I don't care what Dr. Denning says) but
1024 bit RSA keys are still quite useful.

My 2 cents.  While a fantastic computer of radical design (the Quantum
Mechanics computer) would likely solve current ciphers, the new machine
would itself lead to fantastic new ciphers.  

To a large extent, the von Neumann computer was developed to solve the
electro-mechanical machine ciphers of WWII.  However, this machine makes
RSA, a cipher inordinately more complex than the simple Enigma, possible.
Why wouldn't a QM machine lead us to even more fantastic ciphers?

Big fleas have little fleas, etc.

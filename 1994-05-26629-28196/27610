`` A Quantum Cryptosystem Secure Against 
   Beamsplitting Attacks ''

ABSTRACT
This paper presents a quantum cryptosystem
which is secure against beamsplitting and intercept/resend
attacks. A mixed-state quantum key distribution based on
Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is introduced for forcing
an eavesdropper to use more signal energy in a eavesdropping
process, thus loss of light intensity becomes detectable.
Significantly, such a quantum key distribution allows us
to use higher power photon signal, therefore a longer haul
ciphertext communication becomes possible. In addition,
a novel scheme of beamsplitting attack which was not
known previously is also developed for an eavesdropper 
to extract information. We show that while a previously
proposed quantum key exchange system is suspectable to
the new attack, our system is immune to it.

`` Quantum Conference Key Distribution Systems ''

ABSTRACT
We develop cryptographic protocols for conference key
distribution systems based on the uncertainty principle
in quantum physics. The information theoretical limits
to the system correlation between users are demonstrated
to describe quantum-cryptographically protected multi-user
optical communication channels. An estimation of eveasdropping 
via ``intercept/resend" for each quantum system is given. 
It is shown that such attacks can be revealed from the
information and correlation formalism.

   Maurer wrote an article in the procedings of either Eurocrypt 90 or
Eurocrypt 91 that outlined an algorithm to analyse the statistics of a
random bit stream.  You might also want to look into the linear complexity
(shortest LFSR that could reproduce a given sequence) and the linear
complexity's stability (how far can you make the linear complexity drop
by changing some small number of chosen bits).  These last two are used to
analyze stream ciphers, anyway.  You might also look into Lempel-Ziv
complexity, which is simply how often "new" (previously unseen) bit patterns
appear in the bitstream.
 
    Good luck,

I'm looking for leads on an encryption algorithm for the following
problem.

We want to be able to encrypt a 10-20 digit target number with a
6-digit key number such that we can:

A) Get the 6-digit key back from the encrypted result (i.e., if you
knew the algorithm, you could decode any encrypted result).

B) Have the same target number be uniquely different when encrypted
with different 6-digit keys (i.e., a one-to-one mapping).

C) The result of encrypting the target with the key must also be
numbers.

Anyone with ideas, please contact me either via mail or here.

Thanks in advance,

-- jas

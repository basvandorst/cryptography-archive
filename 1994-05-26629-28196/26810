That's a very interesting way to refer to the  the powers of the President.

If the president wants to censor a book, or
abrogate a private and peaceful contract, is he "within his 
rights on matters of national security as Commander in Chief"?

Please explain where the constitution grants the President (or, for
that matter, the Congress) the power to define standard encryption
regimes for non-government agencies, and, if you can't, then please
explain this text in the constitution:

                                AMENDMENT IX
   The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be con-
strued to deny or disparage others retained by the people.


                                AMENDMENT X
   The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor
prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or
to the people.

I'm well aware, by the way, that some find it inconvenient that our own
social contract puts the onus on the Government to prove it has a
power, rather than on the people to prove each particular  freedom, but
I've always found it one of the charming, if neglected,  aspects of 
our system.

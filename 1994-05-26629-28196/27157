Something snapped.

I've been reading sci.crypt for a few months and was half enjoying the 
Sternlight vs (most of?) sci.crypt war.

But his response to article <180303Z07051994@anon.penet.fi>,from 
an78596@anon.penet.fi is completely absurd.

Compare David Sternlights response <strnlghtCpGDts.AKJ@netcom.com> to 
that of Ron McKinnon  <44263@mindlink.bc.ca>.

They make the same points but with a total difference in attitude, 
temperament and civility.

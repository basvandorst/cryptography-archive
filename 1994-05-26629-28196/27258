I have held similar views, but have yet to see them espoused anywhere
else.  It seems intuitive to me that RSA, or any of the public-key
algorithms I've seen proposed, are weak ciphers.  i.e.  DES & IDEA
were designed to hide information - they both incorporate "confusion"
and "diffusion" - the design goal was to make the ciphertext a random
function of the plaintext and they key.  RSA has no such objective, it
merely displays a useful mathematical function.  I can't see any way
of proving that it does any decent job of hiding the plaintext
like a good secret-key cipher would.  But I can't prove it either.

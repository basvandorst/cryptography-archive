David have you ever heard of chaining remailers ? 

If an78569 has chained his posting trough lets say two cypherpunks
remailers wich accept PGP then it will be _very_ difficult to trace
back this poster.  If he used one remailer in the US [outside NSA
jurisdiction] and one or more outside the US before using 
anon.penet.fi how could they trace him back ?

How can they trace him, and positively identify him ?

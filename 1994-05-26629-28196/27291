Here is what I would do:

Convert the passphrase into a hash, using the hash algorythm of your choice.

Use the hash as a seed for a prime number generator. Probably by taking 
the number the hash generates, exponentate it into the realm of secure
primes, and choose the next prime number up from this exponentatilated hash.

Or I could do multiple hashes... I hash the hash, until I get enough
"random" bits to go up to a prime.

Password-generated RSA keys. I like the idea.

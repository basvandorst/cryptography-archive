But the CM-5 is *NOT* a shared memory type machine.  In fact, one of
the great benefits of the vector units (and so also the FPGAs mentioned
above) is not the vector processors themselves, but that you have four
parallel and largely independent 64 bit paths to memory in each node.
Each VU has it's own, private bank of RAM --- I think the vector units
also serve as memory management hardware, but I may be way off on that.  Yes, 
it's slow dynamic RAM.  However, parallel accesses to memory can solve a lot 
of memory bandwidth problems.

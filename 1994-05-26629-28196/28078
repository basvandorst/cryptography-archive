David, does the PATENT cover the key length, or the methodology?  I 
believe that key length is irrelevant to the patent, in which case 
this whole discussion is getting a little pointless.

If I assume the patent is valid, and the license is valid in respect 
of the patent, but the patent does not care what the key length is, 
then where is the beef?  If this is accurate, then increased key size 
can offer better security, which I consider a major performance 
improvement, and yet does not alter the value of the patent or the 
license.

Please let me know where I go wrong.... but NOT by stating that RSA 
has limited the key length via the license if it is not relevant to 
the patent.

I really like to avoid political discussions, but you really *must*
change the wording from "they cannot monitor..." to "they are not
supposed to monitor...".   We're telling them "don't do it, but you
don't tell anybody what you're doing anyway, so we'll never know
if you do".  The abuses of NSA power, and their monitoring of those
dreaded peaceniks and other radicals (US citizens) in the 60's is pretty 
well documented.  Whether this still goes on is an unknown, but I
don't trust someone that has that kind of power when almost noone
has the power to monitor what they're really doing.

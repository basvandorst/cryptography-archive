Can I check the validity of this message without having Murray's public key?

As I understand it, with PEM certificates, a signed message carrying
certificates is self-checking, so to speak, without the need to have the
public key of the writer. Is this a flaw in web-of-trust?

In my experience with RIPEM, the software will automatically go the the key
server to check his public key so I can validate the signature even without
having the public key OR his having certificates. Is there anything
comparably automatic in PGP?

PGP groupies, I'm just asking--not attacking PGP.

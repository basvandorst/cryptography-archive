   Now my question.  If a quote is a complete sentence but doesn't end
   the containing sentence, doesn't logical punctuation dictate:

      He said "I'm leaving." as he walked out the door.

   That doesn't look right.  It actually looks better if the quote is
   a question or exclamation.

     She asked "Where's dinner?" as soon as she got home.

   I don't see any better way to handle that one, since the quote
   is a question but the whole sentence is not.

   If you take logical punctuation to the extreme, wouldn't you have
   to insist a period within quotes can only end the quoted sentence?

     As he walked out the door, he said "I'm leaving.".
     As soon as she got home, she asked "Where's Dinner?".

   Again, the first looks very wrong, but I sort of like the second,
   and if the second is O.K., shouldn't the first be O.K. too?

This is one of those times when following the rules of English <gasp>
is the best way to make yourself clear.  It would look like the
following sentence.

He said, "I'm leaving," as he walked out the door.

I prefer MLA-type punctuation over the more hackerly style except in
documentation, where little characters are important.  This is
probably because I spent a good portion of my time in college as an
English major.

Disclaimer: The above should not imply that English majors on the
whole have good grammar.  Some of the worst mistakes come from that
crowd, mostly from those who read William Burroughs.

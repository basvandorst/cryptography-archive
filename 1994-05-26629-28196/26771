If I did, do you think I could answer?  (I could tell you, but then I'd
have to shoot you :-)

Anyway, other than well-publicized sales, I'm not really familiar with most
of our customer base.

I believe the software architecture is designed to scale larger than that
(e.g. the data type for node addresses is large enough), but I think that's
the max for the current hardware design.

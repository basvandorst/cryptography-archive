I saw one a few years back called 'SoftStrip' it used a laser printer for 
the production of the 1" wide and 9" long strips and a special reader.
I believe DDJ(?) was looking at it to publish code in their magazine.

I would like to see something like this used for the computer journals 
for including source code and executables. (maybe even a few 'Image' 
journals would get into it. :)

We've written a compression/encryption program for DOS boxes and would like 
your help in testing it.

I'll email you a copy of a sample file.  The first person who successfully 
breaks it and sends us the uncompressed and unencrypted file gets 50 bucks.
And to make it interesting, I'm threatening to make the money come out of 
the _programmer's_ pocket.  Entries must be received by May 20, 1994.

Send me your email address and I'll mail you the compressed/encrypted file.

good luck!

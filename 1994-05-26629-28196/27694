Nope. Read the PEM documentation and RFCs. It is called the IPRA.

You better read the documentation about the security hardware and safeguards
built into the RSADSI Certification Authority before you decide it's just
something any old company can do on its own. In the end, another company
would have to use the same BBN boxes, etc. to extablish trust, and would
have to be certified by a higher authority. There is a carefully controlled
national and international heirarchical system designed for this purpose.
This is not the place for me to read the PKCS and RFCs to you; do it
yourself.

This is, in general, false, and is irrelevant to the present situation.
We're not talking about some individual being a central certification
authority, but formal processes, safeguards, security hardware and lots of
other stuff Joe Blow can't afford, justify, or be relied on to handle in a
trustworthy, unbribeable manner.

It's hilarious that those who object to Clipper because "one or two people
can be bribed" are suddenly enamored of using one or two people with PGP,
just because it's their favorite and Clipper isn't for other reasons.

  He also forgets the rest of our heritage.  The social contract
includes much more than government.  The Constitution stipulates
religious freedom.  But respect for other religions is a part of the
social compact.  The Declaration of Independence and the Gettysburg
Address are no less a part of the social contract because they are not
offical government documents.  (The Declaration was a statement by a
two day old government which was later formalized by the Articles of
Confederation, then superceded by the Constitution.  But all Acts of
Congress are still dated both on the Gregorian calendar and from the
adoption of the Declaration.  Our ancestors placed the Declaration
above mere government, and some of us still do.)

   > There is no "right to privacy" in natural law.

   This is a fundamental misunderstanding of the concept of "natural
law."  Natural law consists of the laws of God not handed down through
revelations to prophets, but revealed through the laws of nature.  If
P/=NP, then there is a right to public key cryptography in natural
law.  There is a fundamental right to privacy in natural law.  Think
of it as, "If God intended us not to have privacy, everyone would have
X-ray vision."

    Most of the learned discussion in the area of natural law focuses
on thornier issues.  Is homosexuality against natural law since it
"obviously" leads to extinction, or is it a part of natural law since
it appears spontaneously in overcrowded populations?  (No flames
please, either direction.  I'm just trying to choose an example of a
thorny issue, not take a position.)

[Deep breath]

The short answer is safe except possibly for critical military/dipomatic
purposes *provided* you set the key length to the maximum (1024) and
exercise all the normal precautions.

The long answer is set your reader to pick up the last two weeks posts in
sci.crypt and alt.security.pgp - particularly the contributions by
Bob Silverman and Paul Leyland in threads RSA-129 and similar.

The trouble is that for every expert (and there are several who post here)
there are at least a dozen less knowledgeable posters who tend to 
to mis-state things. Any attempt to hash over the ground again is unlikely 
to be productive. But all the information to form a sensible assessment
is already posted.

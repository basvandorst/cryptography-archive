David, tsk.  

Usenet does nor reach many of the various lists that people are on (and
that the call for e-mail petitions went out on).  Many people don't really
want to waste a stamp sending you a letter, so that you can decide to
report whatever you want.  It seems that your pre-existing biasses are
showing, and surprize, your findings seem to match.  Is this an instance
of sloppy methodology on your part?

[ The experiment you suggested was done. It produced singularly unpersuasive

[ In a time interval comparable to the one in which CPSR reported 10,000

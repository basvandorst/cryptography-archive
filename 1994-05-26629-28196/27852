Does anyone know where I could get a public domain implementation of the
DES in IBM S/370 assembler? Also any other algorithms in S/370 assembler
would be nice to have access to, if available.
 
This is my first usenet msg (ever) so I hope I am on the right forum and
am using the correct procedure.

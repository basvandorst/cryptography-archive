	How about training E-coli to factor primes? You'd need a few
buckets of syrup and a big tank... :)

	What's Sternlight's point? That RSA shouldn't be used just
because some future technology could render it moot?? All crypto 
to date has eventually fallen prey to newer technologies. That
doesn't mean you shouldn't use them.

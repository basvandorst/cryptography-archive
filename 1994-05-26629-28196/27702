   I'm really confused by that statement.  If the government licenses
PGP 2.6 for export (and since David repeated the phrase "licensed for
export," I can't believe he missed it), is it possible for such an
export to still be found illegal under ITAR?  Talk about a "chilling
effect on the First Ammendment," not to mention entrapment!  Sheesh!

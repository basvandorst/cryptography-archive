Having seen some of the documents in question (relating to TEMPEST),
the documents listed are not all classified.  A title followed either
by a classification such as '(secret)', specifies that the document is
classified secret, not that the title is classified secret.  Some of the
documents (such as the Federal Standard) are unclassified. 

A document containing a list of classified titles would be itself classified
to the highest classification either of other data or a classified title.

The possible violation of espionage laws doesn't stem from titles of
documents, rather from solicitation, which without specifics as to who
is being asked to procur them would be difficult to prove in the case
of a broadcast request.  I am of the the belief that he would also have
to be working on behalf of a foreign power (if a U.S. citizen) before it is 
espionage.  Were he a reporter he could publish them (as in the Pentagon 
Papers) although one would hope that he would have pause to examine the 
morality of the deed.   Note that were he to have previous access to classifed
information, his agreement to protect classified information may be so
broad as to cover ANY classified information after severability, but then who
is to say whether a document found not through espionage nor through legitimate
access is indeed under a classified document control system?  I had a nifty
rubber stamp that stamped TOP SECRET NOFORN, but adding that label to say, 
this post, doesn't make it so.  ( If he offered real money, how many different
items of dubious origin might he have to chose from? )

The guy might be operating under the misunderstanding that these documents
are available in the public domain, such as the Friedman books on cryptography
claimed to be classified by the NSA, yet found on public library shelves by
John Gilmore - invalidating the classification. 

Mean spirited humor.

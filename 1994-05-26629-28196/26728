For someone who claims to be with a Law Review you did an incompetent job.
"Attributions" in this case are quotes from previous traffic in support or
refutations of the point. Thus Austern needs to provide quotes from my past
traffic to substatiate that I said "so many negative things about the whole
idea that public debate can and should influence national policy". He cannot
because I did not. What's more I've often posted strongly to the contrary of
his assertion.

In your case, if you had done a competent job you will have noticed those
little ">" signs which my messages are rife with. Those are
attributions--quotes from the traffic I'm commenting on.

It's clear you're posting in bad faith. Perhaps you're part of the gang
we're hearing about which moves in to newsgroups to disrupt them. Perhaps
not. In any case the content of your messages make it clear you no longer
deserve to be taken  seriously.

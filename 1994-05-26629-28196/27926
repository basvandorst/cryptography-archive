Thanks. That's also my self-perception.

Wrong. I use Ripem and Ripem Mac, and beta test new versions. The only
differences between those and PGP is:

a: the use of triple DES instead of IDEA, which some experts think to be
MORE secure because:

1. DES has been studied longer;
2. Triple DES has a longer effective key length than IDEA.

though the difference in security is thought to be small.

and

watch closely here. At no time do my fingers leave my hands

b: Ripem is unquestionably non-infringing in the U.S. No doubt. No shadows.
No "interpretation" of the license. RSADSI has not only said so explicitly,
but also makes it available from THEIR ftp site, which they don't for PGP.

It is "b" that makes the difference for me, not all this defamatory crap
posted by those who can't stand to admit that their favorite "cause", PGP,
is still under a cloud in the U.S.( except for the "pay" version 2.4 and the
promised 2.6 version if it lives up to MIT's claims about its licensing).

I "love" secure crypto. As for "impenetrable", nobody but the NSA knows for
sure.

But I do not support infringing whatever; infringing crypto, infringing
software, infringing CDs, pirate tapes, pirated software.

Clear, now?

SECDEV13.ARJ (bugfix - again)

Hi all,

The previous version of SecureDevice (1.2) was kindof a rush job - we
found a bug which accounted for the error of not being able to create
volumes >8MB, fixed it, and released it. We tested it with 15 Meg, and
it worked fine. We should have tested it better.

Murphy had some more tricks to play: a bug which effected volumes >16MB.

It seems that we've finally set things straight now. We tested it
ourselves with a 50 MB volume and it works fine.

We're deeply sorry that we have to release yet another version (the 2nd
bugfix in 4 days). As a 'bonus', MKVOLUME has had a considerable speedup
in creating volumes (probably a factor 10 or so).

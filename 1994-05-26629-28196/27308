What algorithm does PGP use to generate random numbers?  Can it be run
backwards to determine earlier random numbers that were generated by the
number currently recorded in randseed.bin?

I started wondering about this when helping somebody else set up PGP. 
If somebody had your randseed.bin, could they run it backwards in steps,
using it at each step with PGP's key-generation algorithm, to find the
key that was originally generated with that randseed.bin?

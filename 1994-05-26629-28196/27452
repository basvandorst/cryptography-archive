I think we'll have to agree to disagree.  In addition to our different
recollections, you said there "was no point in debating technical aspects
we knew nothing about until the committee set up to examine and report on
those matters did so."  After the committee met, you said there was no
point in debating technical aspects because it was a "done deal".

...., by which time it will be a "done deal".  Fortunately, Congress is
holding hearings.

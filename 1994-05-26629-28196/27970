I am looking for some advice on which algorithm to use with a 
speech encryption system I am currently designing.

The system is based on a Motorola 68000 computer (VMPM68KA-2) 
and has facilities for 8-bit A/D- and D/A-conversion at a 
sample rate of 8kHz.

At the moment I consider using IDEA, but the block size 
(64-bit) doesn't suit me very well as I'll have to collect 8 
samples before encrypting them. This results in an unwanted 
delay of the speech signal. What would happen if I reduced 
the block size to 16-bit?

I would like to look at some stream ciphers for comparison on 
suitability, but I haven't been able to find any.

Any help or ideas would be appreciated.

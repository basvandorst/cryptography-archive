Hello...I haven't been reading this group for a while, but as I remember,
didn't the VCRPlus people make a big stink about decoding their codes?
How was that finally resolved?

Also, I still fail to understand why people prefer to use such a
non-intuitive interface like VCRPlus.  I would think it is much easier to
just tell the VCR when to start and stop recording on what channel instead
of punching in a series of nonsense numbers that has to be looked up in the
TV guide.  Can someone who actually likes using VCRPlus explain to me WHY
they like the system?

Regards,
Paul

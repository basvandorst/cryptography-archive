It should be pointed out that the "common defense" and "domestic
tranquility" clauses are in the Preamble to the Constitution, and
therefore thought by some to be less law than commentary.  Sort of
like [asbestos suit on] the "militia" clause in the Second Amendment.

Although you can probably come up with other justifications for such
executive power, the "common defense" and "domestic tranquility"
clauses constitute what IMHO is a fairly weak argument.

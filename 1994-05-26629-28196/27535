      The problem is that many people, DS included, have some posts that
   raise valid, interesting issues, and others that are pointless flames.
   Some of the best posters on this group occasionally post fluff or
   flames.  I'm not willing to put *everyone* into my kill file.  

While DS's opinions about the trustability of governments and other
existing power structures do differ radically from my own (:-)),
and while he seems to enjoy a good flamewar on occasion,
it's usually pretty easy to distinguish between the flamewars and the
useful articles, and at least he doesn't detweil at us.
In particular, if you're killing all his articles, you're missing some
good discussions about how to make PGP and other email systems more
usable on Macintoshen, and other issues of RSA technical approaches.

Articles with "Sternlight" in the title, of course, having minimal
chance on not being flames :-)

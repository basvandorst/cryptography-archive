Some people in the press and on the net have missquoted something
from the Aug 1977 Scientific American article and claimed that
scientists thought it would take 40 quadrillion years to break RSA-129.
That is NOT what was said.  Here is the quote (from 1977):

> Contrast this with the difficulty of finding the two prime factors
> of a 125 or 126-digit number obtained by multiplying two 63-digit

That time was only with a 1977 computer and 1977 factoring algorithm. 
Clearly computers were expected to get faster, algorithms to get
better, and of course more than one computer could be used.  They
expected to pay off on the "ciphertext challenge worth $100".
The wording was:

> As a challenge to Scientific American readers the M.I.T. group

RSA has generated a lot more interest in factoring numbers.  The
factoring algorithms have gotten much better.  Computers have also
gotten a couple thousand times more cost effective.  And the Internet
makes using a large number of idle machines possible.

The improvement over the 40 quadrillion years could be broken into
something like:

      2,000    hardware speedup
      1,000    many machines
 20,000,000    better algorithms

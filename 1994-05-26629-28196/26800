No. My point is to get qualified experts here to state specific and
up-to-date security properties of RSA keys of length 512 and 1024, in terms
of time to crack by organizations with the presumed power, money,
computation power, and motivation of the NSA as a surrogate for its foreign
opposite numbers. It is also to get some similar measure on how long the
IPRA key should be.

I want such information based on careful analysis, assuming the best known
technologies of today and the near-future, not on hand waving or approximate
aggregate assertions. This means considering machine type, power, intensity
of use, etc. To date there's been a lot of wind and some very sloppy
aggregated hand waving about the number of molecules in this and that in
response to my message, but few useful responses. The last really useful
work I've seen is Rivest's, but it is both dated and incomplete with respect
to the output variable I think most relevant.

I'm particularly disappointed at the response from the MITRE employee. While
on staff at the RAND Corporation, II worked on some of the first command and
control systems with MITRE in the late 1950's, along with some of my fellow
MIT alumni. The level of intelligence, sophistication, and engineering
analytic ability there was remarkably high, and to get the kind of
contemptuous junk answers back that we have in this discussion is a sad
commentary on either the particular respondent, or the quality of MITRE's
work in this area in general.

Arrogance is no substitute for analysis.

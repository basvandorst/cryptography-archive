There aren't any known plaintext attacks or RSA _per se_, although
there are protocol failures caused by misusing public key algorithms.
One of these is known as the "low entropy" protocol failure, which
occurs where the attacker knows what messages are possible, and simply
has to encrypt each one of the possibilities to see which is correct.
This can easily be prevented by using common plaintext whitening
techniques.

In order to save confusion, it is best not to describe this
possibility as a vulnerability of RSA to chosen plaintext attacks.
Clearly, if any public-key algorithm were vulnerable to such attacks
it would be of no use at all.

A protocol failure, which occurs only when an algorithm is misused, is
not the same thing as a vulnerability of that algorithm to attack.

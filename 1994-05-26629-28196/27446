        The inelegant but simple way to do this is to encrypt the
        message with a randomly chosen key. Add two bits to this,
        each consisting of the message key encrypted with one of the
        other keys.

        This is particularly effective with public key methods and is
        a feature of PGP.
        
        Cheers,
                Marc

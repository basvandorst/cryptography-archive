Since in some areas of the world shortwave radio and modems are still
regulated, I doubt that PGP is merely an academic execise to activists
in those countries who are technically capable.

In any event, I just want people throughout the world to be able to communicate
their ideas to themselves (a diary) and to others with technically absolute
privacy from the State.  Whether the means is PGP, RIPEM, or Brand X doesn't
matter at all.

I think you would be hard-pressed to find someone as "smart" or
"knowledgeable" as Bob Silverman, particularly someone that will hang
around sci.math answering random questions.

(Btw, I'm not measuring Silverman's talents by number of Usenet
postings, but rather by publications.  See his papers in Mathematics
of Computation, for instance.  No doubt he has published elsewhere
too.  He's not your random Usenet hack or hacker.)

He *is* answering your questions as best he can.  Maybe *you* need to
be more specific in your questions instead of flaming.

I was wondering if any of the 'cypher' people have worked on 'decrypting'
DNA on a larger scale.  There a number of projects that will take a DNA
sequence and predict the coding regions.  But there is a LOT more to
genetics than just coding for proteins.  (It is part of a complex/dynamic
system and regulation is very important, the 'junk' DNA is VITAL for
proper expression of the genes).

Just curious question, with interest in helping anyone interested
with the genetics side of the problem.

Thanks!

Mark

Thoughts to ponder:
Life is Paradox: one = many, many = one.
Most difficult tasks are easy, it just depends on if you know the solution.
All tasks are easy, it all depends on who you ask.

Sure. It meant that the NSA has had, and likely continues to have hardware
dramatically more powerful than anything in civilian use, and thus
calculations about their capabilities based on conventional workstation
capabilities, for example, are probably far off the mark, as are
calculations about, for example, Connection Machines we know about.

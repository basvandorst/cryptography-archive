I quote, from Tom Rearick of the Lotus Word Processing Division.  "A
consultant is needed IMMEDIATELY to document how to break this code
(or demonstrate that a 12-character splay encryption provides less
security than a 40-bit RSA) and/or to travel with us to the NSA spook
house in Fort Mead, MD."

I get the feeling that the folks at NSA really don't want to allow the
export of any coding system that they can't break with pencil and paper!
So what if you can buy better on the street in St Petersburg, so what
if I published the algorithm in an international journal in 1988, code
that uses it isn't exportable.

Sure, I'll be happy to.  :)

To summarize: Sternlight made a (reasonable) request for information;
you (Bob) responded with substantial, reasonable data fulfilling his
request, given reasonable facilities of interpretation; he (Sternlight)
responded with a complaint that totally failed to grasp your response,
e.g., raising points of "calendar time" and "processor speed" that were
completely irrelevant to your dimensions of "MIPS-years", and then
stupidly complained that you hadn't fulfilled his demand (as if he was
paying for it :); you (Bob) responded with a testy, but reasonable
reply (IMHO, given the provocation), to which Sternlight responded with
one of the most offensive posts I've ever seen on the Internet.

Herr Professor Doctor Sternlight often behaves as if, for him,
arrogance is a perfectly acceptable substitute for intelligence.  For
others, of course, he has distinctly higher standards; his public
lectures on civility now leave me rolling on the floor laughing. 
Truly, I'm quite sorry that we don't get alt.fan.david-sternlight here.

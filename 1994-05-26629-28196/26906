There is an official test called the "DES Mantenance Test" which proves 
that the algorithm is working properly. I think it is documented in one 
of the FIPS pubs. It entails a sequence 64 encrypt/encrypt/decrypt 
operations starting with a fixed input and key and feeding back outputs 
at appropriate stages. At the end, if your result equals the required 
test value, you are OK.. Otherwise, forget it.

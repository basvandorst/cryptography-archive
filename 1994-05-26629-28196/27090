  No, if you can read the FAQ, go ahead and post.  But if you see a
group sci.therbligs and ask "Does the gostak bestim the doshes?"*
Don't be surpised if the answer looks like nonsense.  Or if you post a
question in sci.thermodynamics and never studied calculus, or post a
question about the origins of father in sci.linguistics and never
heard of Urdu, etc.

* Only on usenet would I be sure that someone will correct my spelling
and puctuation.  (And probably tell me that while father is
Indo-European, it most likely derived from Sanskrit.)  Anyway I only
read the book once and didn't really like it.  Therbligs on the other
hand are referenced in the Notebooks of Lazarus Long (from Time Enough
for Love by RAH).  I hope to live long enough to find out what they
are.

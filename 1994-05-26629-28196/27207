I have received many questions regarding how my random numbers would be
generated.  Well, I will provide both OTP capability and stream cipher
using a pseudo random generator.  The OTP random source will likely be
from diode noise, or a link to static found on a radio that is not
tuned to a station.  I was thinking of making a little board to plug into
the parallel port or something along those lines.  

I wish that I could say that I came up with a real neat way of generating
random numbers... oh well.

Some type of analogue to digital converter will fit the bill.

My goal is to provide a program to demonstrate the concept...
originally to allow Scouts and Guides a chance to have some fun sending
"SECRET" messages, not to compete with the Intelligence world.

You might consider looking at the "subtract-with-borrow" generator developed
by George Marsaglia  ("A New Class of Randon Number Generator", G. 
Marsaglia and Z.Zammar, The Annals of Applied Probability, 1991,
Vol 1, Num 1, pp.462-480) as source of of generators of sequences that
have lengths >10**200 and which pass all the the standard tests for
for randomness.

You would probably want to combine that work with some recent work on 
physical sources of noise:

	"Unstable periodic orbits and the dimensions of multifractacal
	 chaotic attractors", G.Grebogi, E.Ott and J.A.Yorke, Physical
	 Review A, Vol 37, p.1711 (1988)

	"Controlling Chaos", E.Ott,G.Grebogi,J.A.Yorke, Physical Reveiew
	 Letters, Vol 64, p.1196 (1990)

	"Experimental Control of Chaos", W.L.Ditto,S.N.Rauseo,M.L.Spano,
	 Physical Review Letters, Vol 65, p.3211 (1990)

Applied properly, you should be able to construct a cryptosystem that
is indistinguishable by any finite test from a classical one-time pad.

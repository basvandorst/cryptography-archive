So, who is this Jeff Schiller? A random student perhaps? No, he's the
head of DCNS-Net. (Distributed Computing & Network Services) DCNS is one
of the three major divisions of MIT Information Systems. Look what you
get when you finger jis@mit.edu:

      name: Schiller, Jeffrey I
     email: JIS@MIT.EDU
   address: E40-311
department: Dist Comp & Network
     title: Network Manager

[Remember that address: E40-311]

O.K. how about the machine serving PGP 2.5, net-dist.mit.edu? Well,
hostinfo reveals this:

>/mit/hosts% hostinfo net-dist
>Desired host:   net-dist
>Official name:  BITSY.MIT.EDU
>Alias:          net-dist.MIT.EDU
>Host address:   18.72.0.3
>Host info:      DEC/DECSTATION-5000.25/ULTRIX

O.K., so what do we know about bitsy.mit.edu? Try a grep on the MIT host
table listing:

>/mit/hosts% grep BITSY /afs/athena.mit.edu/astaff/reference/hosts/hosts
>HOST : 18.72.0.3 : BITSY,E40-311B-1,NET-DIST,NIC,NS3 : DEC/DECSTATION-5000.25 
>ULTRIX :                 ^^^^^^^

Does that address look familiar? 

The PGP 2.5 announcemenet goes on to say:

    >> If you obtain a copy of this beta release code, please keep
    >> checking http://web.mit.edu for the announcement of the final
    >> release, so that you can update your copy of PGP2.5.  We expect

web.mit.edu is the official MIT web server and is run by MIT I/S. Here
are two random tidbits you will find on the server: one is the first
thing you see and the other is about the maintainers.

>The Massachusetts Institute of Technology is an independent,
>coeducational university located in Cambridge, MA. This MIT Home Page
>provides a guide to a variety of campus information resources. If you
>are looking for informal information and outside links, then you may

>want to see the MIT SIPB WWW Server.

Sternlight: This means that only official MIT annoucements and
information get placed here. All others go on the MIT SIPB server.

>At this time, the maintainers of web.mit.edu are all members of the

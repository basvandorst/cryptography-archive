   Assuming that I'd like to implement RSA legally, does anyone have
   an idea of how much RSA licenses the algorithm for?  Do they license
   to individuals, to businesses, what?  I know, I can ask them, but if
   anyone knows, it would save a lot of confusion.

   Also, does anyone know when their patent runs out?  Are patents good
   for 99 years, or what?

U.S. patents are good for 17 years from date of issue.
The RSA patent runs out in 2000, Schnorr in 2008, the rest in 1997.
"The rest" includes Diffie-Hellman and the other patents they're using
to claim a lock on the whole field of public-key crypto, so after 1997
you'll be able to use any other non-patented public-key system without
asking them.  As far as licensing terms, PKP offers a wide range of
options, from free (the RSAREF 2.0 toolkit, available by ftp from
rsa.com or the various PGP 2.5 distribution sites, but limited in what
you're allowed to do with it), to more typical commercial licenses,
and they'll also sell you software if you want.  jim@rsa.com is their
company president and the usual guy to bother about such things,
after you've read their FAQ files.

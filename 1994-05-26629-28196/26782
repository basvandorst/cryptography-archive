I found the following quote from the RSA-FAQ intriguing:

Is there any basis for a claim that a "negative breakthrough" is more likely
than a "positive breakthrough"??  Lower bounds are notoriously difficult
to prove, and almost all actual lower bounds on time complexity are fairly
basic arguments giving pretty weak bounds.  Of course, there are also
lower bounds based on unproved assumptions like P!=NP.  However, it seems
like real lower bound proofs for number-theoretic type problems are
very difficult to come by (even of the latter type).  The security of
most number-theory based algorithms for cryptography seems to be based on
the hardness of problems such as factoring or finding discrete logs, but
the "evidence of hardness" is usually along the lines of a statement such
as "people have been trying for a long time to factor, and still don't have
efficient algorithms".  That's not exactly a formal proof...  :-)

So my real question for any experts out there:  is there any work out there
giving rigorous proofs that address the hardness of such number-theoretic
problems?  Or is RSA, Inc.'s opinion that RSA is secure just biasing their
statement here?

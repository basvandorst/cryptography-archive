I wonder if their definition of non-commercial is similar to the one
announced for RIPEM/SIG--that is, you can't do commercial things with the
code itself, like sell it or charge for it, but you can use it to encrypt
and decrypt traffic used for commercial purposes?

If so, PGP-MIT is going to become one net standard very quickly, all right,
because of its very easy defaults,  where the program figures out (as much
as possible) what your intentions are from the files you give it, rather
than your having to tell it a lot of stuff in the command line. I really
like the idea of PGP <filename> and if it's an encrypted file it shows up in
your face as plaintext. Compare that with the current Ripem interface.

Command line interfaces aren't a sign that the user wants things made
difficult for him.

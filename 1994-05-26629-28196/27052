Occasional folk in this thread have read the problem slightly
differently: "how can I encrypt something today and be sure it'll
still be unreadable <n> years in the future."  For that question, this
parallel evolution of compute power is not relevent.

On the other hand, I'm not sure it's desirable to give "them" that
much of an advantage anyway - <n>==30 might not make a significant
hole in the factorability of a 4096-bit key, but it might make a big
hole in some other weakness - say, the chance someone who knows
whatever it is you're protecting tells his best buddy the secrets over
a beer ... "why, back in 1994, we ..."

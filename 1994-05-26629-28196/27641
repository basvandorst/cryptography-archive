   Is there a public domain version of the "crypt" program around? That is,

There probably is one somewhere like ftp.funet.fi ; you could telnet
to an archie site and look for it.  You can probably find copies
anywhere you can find Crypt Breaker's Workbench (cbw).
Crypt is not a very strong algorithm; the research.att.com folks moved
it to /usr/games a few years ago....

(And, no, it's not supported by PGP.)

   I agree that this kind of thinking is flawed, for two reasons:
 
1.  By breaking the keys of key-distribution centers or key certifiers
    (or simply people who've issued lots of key certificates), someone
    who can crack just five keys per year can use those five keys to
    do some serious active attacks.  Once I know how to issue highly-
    trusted key-certificates, I simply (carefully) choose peoples'
    communications I wish to compromise, and then substitute in
    an RSA public key *I* generated for both parties' public keys,
    certifying them myself.  Both parties send things only I can read,
    and I sit in the middle, decrypting and re-encrypting everything.
 
2.  More importantly, we're trying to get digital signatures accepted
    in courts and among most people, so that electronic business
    transactions are trustworthy.  *One* well-publicized case where
    it was proved that a digital signature had been forged would make
    *every* digital contract ripe for being questioned in court.
 
    We need to make sure that users of digital signature and crypto
schemes understand when they're using keys that might be compromised,
but are convenient (like using a 512-bit RSA key in a smartcard, for
transactions under $1,000 per month), versus when they're using keys
that we believe won't be compromised within the lifetime of anyone
now living (ie, 3000-bit RSA keys used for signing 50-year contracts
digitally.)

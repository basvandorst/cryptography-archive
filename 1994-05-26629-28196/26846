As I said, this was just an inference from previous posts: (1) Person at
TM told you time for 1024 processor CM-5 to factor RSA-129; (2) Person at
Mitre told you how many times longer it would take to factor a 1024-bit
RSA number; (iii) It is possible to build a 10,000 processor machine
for this problem which can be easily partitioned; (iv) We can expect to 
use an algorithm like that of the recent effort; (v) I guess it is possible
to overcome memory access problems even now; (vi) The real speculation is
in the design and efficiency of a custom processor for the algorithm. I
guess it might yield a speed-up of 10-1000 times (over a CM-5 processor),
depending on how much fine-level parallelism can be exploited (hardwired)
by custom circuitry. But there are potentially many such designs (as 
there are for coventional general purpose CPU's ranging from 68000's to 
C-40's. I gave what I considered to be a 'moderate' forthcoming answer.
I ignored economics. (The govt is not well-known to be very cost-
efficient. I guess it would cost roughly 100 million dollars, primarily
because of expensive custom memory.)

No you didn't - you gave no clue about the design of the custom
processors and memory. And without this we can't determine efficiency
or even cost very accurately. There is no one design. (Your post
referred only to number of processors; this bears on "coarse-grain"
parallelism; but the parallelism of the custom processors/memory
is another matter, and far more important, about which you said nothing.
Neither did I. I only made moderate guesses about speed-ups. But it
was guesswork to be sure.

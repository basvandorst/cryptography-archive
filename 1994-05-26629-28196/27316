Sorry to be so far off the newsgroups' subjects, but I like the
logical punctuation method.  In _LaTeX_User's_Guide_and_
_Reference_Manual, on page 13, Leslie Lamport  writes:

    `Convention' dictates that punctuation go
    inside quotes, like "this," but I think
    it's better to do "this".

Now my question.  If a quote is a complete sentence but doesn't end
the containing sentence, doesn't logical punctuation dictate:

   He said "I'm leaving." as he walked out the door.

That doesn't look right.  It actually looks better if the quote is
a question or exclamation.

  She asked "Where's dinner?" as soon as she got home.

I don't see any better way to handle that one, since the quote
is a question but the whole sentence is not.

If you take logical punctuation to the extreme, wouldn't you have
to insist a period within quotes can only end the quoted sentence?

  As he walked out the door, he said "I'm leaving.".
  As soon as she got home, she asked "Where's Dinner?".

Again, the first looks very wrong, but I sort of like the second,
and if the second is O.K., shouldn't the first be O.K. too?

   Dear Arthur,

I am working for the company in Finland specializing in data protection
tools. We have very good cooperation with a company called uti-maco
Belgium. They specialize in encryption tool kits and algorithms. Lately
they have also made a product called CryptMail.

They have toolkits and implementations of algorithms for at least
DES, RSA, DSS and IDEA(I think this last one is under negotiations
right now). Then they have a Mail Toolkit which is higher level API
to implement security features easy to E-mail systems. Nice product
is DynPass for Novell and Unix which uses tokens to authenticate
users. DynPass is built upon Authenticator Toolkit which is also
available as a developer tool. Of course they also have Toolkits
for the integration of SmartCards and also they have tools for all
the other needed functions in E-mail protection like MD4 and MD5.

A very interesting new product they now have is a Crypto Server,
which can be connected to for example Tandem or other mini or
to IBM Mainframe (or clone) to implement fast encryption
"processor". Nicest of all they have nice API for it for lot
of different platforms. Crypto Server is a normal micro (386-486)
having a uti-maco Belgium's crypto card or several them. DES
and RSA toolkit's (and products using them) are (if I have
understood right) implemented so that they can use automatically
hardware if available and if not available a software implementation
will be used.

Other things which make them strong is that they have a preferred
partnership with COSIC (Computer security and industrial cryptography),
the renowned research group of the Catholic University of Leuven.
Also other line of their operation is to have an exclusive
representation contract with uti-maco safeguard system GmbH
products for Belgium and Luxemburg. uti-maco safeguard system GmbH
is the biggest pc security company in Europe and the resent
fusion of SafeWare to it made it even more strong.

Well this sounds like an advertisement, but hey it is NOT
at least paid one :-) But I thought people in this conference
don't get too upset of this. I personally always appreciate
any pointers I get from here. Of course there is several others
in Europe but I don't have any experience of them. I think
in this area of business the trust is very important and I can
see that uti-maco Belgium has been a leader in this area for
many ears and it also seems that they will stay so in future.



CryptMail <----> PGP
====================
I have pressed quite hard uti-maco Belgium to make CryptMail PGP
compatible. I think they might even do it, but any further "pressure" on
this subject would be appreciated. Would it be illegal to make CryptMail
PGP compatible? I mean is there some patents or copyrights involved? And
am I wrong in that sense that I think CryptMail must be PGP and ViaCrypt
compatible?
Again I would be very grateful for any comments and insight
on this matter and all answers here and mailed privately
to me are passed to uti-maco Belgium if not clearly stated
that they are _for my eyes only_.

Wrong again. One of my clients, for whom I did an 18 month strategic
planning project quite recently, is one of the premier defense electronics
and systems houses in the world. I became quite familiar with some of their
best custom unclassified hardware and developments, and saw enough of other
developments to feel on quite secure ground on this matter. I suggest that
you have quite a bit less relevant currrent experience on some of the
relevant technologies than I. As the Russians are fond of saying, don't try
to teach your Grandmother how to suck eggs. I may not be a recent MIT
graduate, but that doesn't mean I don't keep up, and it certainly doesn't
mean I'm stupid.

Unless you have special compartmented clearances you would have no way of
knowing WHAT the NSA's best machines are, or those of GCHQ, the Russians, or
the Japanese comparable organizations. You are talking about what you DO
know. I am suggesting an analysis based on the state of the chip art.
Others, apparently quite expert in electronics, have suggested what such
special-purpose crypto cracking machines might look like.

This is just plain false. You are comparing the computers a shipboard
maintenance technician might be familiar with with a discussion of what is
likely to be ARPA's or NSA's best. It is you who are working from an
obsolete knowledGe base, not I.

I guess the translation of that remark is that you don't understand what I
just said and have no rational response.

Let me help you out. It is not a necessary condition of doing something for
half as much that it be done four times as fast. Any correlation between
those two factors has been driven not by causality but by technological
coincidence. Thus your attribution to causality "have to do it" of one
thing which simply follows another is the same as the rooster's error in
thinking that his crowing makes the sun rise just because every time he
crows in the morning the sun rises. The technical name for that fallacy is
"post hoc ergo propter hoc".

So what? This is not a message thread for ex maintenance technicians to
bitch about the reliabililty of hardware which has nothing to do with the
hardware we're discussing. If you want your own thread on how shipboard
military computers are unreliable, change the topic.

What is this, some new kind of spelling flame? We still call it Sixth Avenue
in New York City, and insiders still call the ships I designed the DD-963
class, and the LHA class, not the "Spruance Class Destroyers" and the
"Tarawa Class Amphibious Assault Ships". I don't suppose I helped give you
part of your living when you were doing electronics maintenance on Navy
ships, did I?

You clearly haven't been near a good defense electronics contractor doing
state-of-the art RDT&E or manufacturing lately.

No. I mean something quite different that you obviously have not seen.
I wouldn't want to repeat the specs on this kind of widely read
international forum, although there was nothing classified about the demo I
saw, and there were a lot of senior foreign millitary brass in attendance as
well as our own. Didn't see any Iraqis, though.  :-)

False. The civilian air traffic control systems of the future will use the
kind I'm talking about, though certainly not the kind you are.

Again, you aren't talking about the systems I am. You are using an obsolete
knowledge base to make pronouncements on current state of the art. It's
kinda amusing that apparently I'm much more up-to-date than you seem to be,
since you're trying to make a vice out of my age.

You clearly are also unfamiliar with the special satellites used by the
intelligence community. Your 2400 baud remark is quite naive even in
reference to satellites whose capabilities we've revealed on occasion in the
past at the UN, when political conditions necessitated it. Go see Patriot
Games for an approximation by simulation. Tom Clancy has VERY good sources
when it comes to talking about the latest state-of-the-art technology in
actual use, though he had to emulate real-time infra-red high data rate
satellites because they wouldn't let him show the real stuff. Or is it your
notion that full-motion video real time surveillance satellites use 2400
baud?

By the way, when it comes to military ship systems, there may be good
special-weapons related reasons to use low data rates in some systems. And
when it comes to systems for communicating with underwater subs--well,
that's a discussion for another time.

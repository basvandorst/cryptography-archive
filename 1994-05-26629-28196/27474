 I am aware of no formal analysis of "web-of-trust" as a secure
 cryptographic protocol.  Strangely, sci.crypt has held many huge
 discussions on the strength of RSA and IDEA, but few if any on
 the relative difficulty of defeating "web-of-trust."

 Failure of "web-of-trust" to identify a "spoofed" invalid key
 leaves the PGP design open to "man-in-the-middle" attack.  While
 many consider such attack unlikely, I wonder just how unlikely
 this cheap and easy method would be when compared to the capital
 and time required to attack even a 512-bit RSA key.  Note that
 the Network itself seems almost the ideal resource for the
 automatic re-routing of messages needed in such an attack.

 "Web-of-trust" is almost certainly the weakest part of the PGP
 design.  Sure, "web-of-trust" makes key-exchange *easy*, but it
 does not guarantee real security.  And if there is no need for
 real security, there is no need for 1024-bit RSA or 128-bit IDEA
 keys either.  There are at least three ways into PGP; it does not
 make much sense to lock two of them with vault doors and the third
 with a kid's padlock (if that).

 In my view it would be a terrible mistake to compound this error
 into future cryptographic designs.

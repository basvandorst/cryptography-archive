Very well.  You are right.  Saying that RSA is weak against known-plaintext
attacks is equivalent to saying that RSA is weak.

Nevertheless, I do recollect reading that RSA should not be used to encrypt
messages exhibiting regularities, such as English text, and that it's
better used to encrypt random bit-strings with low semantic content, such
as IDEA keys.  I'll try to find what I read.

Of course, compressing the plaintext beforehand would avoid the problem.

Later,
Rujith.

RSA operates properly for any n if you can find d and e, such that 
de mod phi(n)=1.  The product of two primes is used because

The algorithm will work if 2 is one of the prime factors.  Obviously, any RSA 
modulus with 2 as a factor is worthless for cryptograhpy.  (Some implementations
of RSA, however, use a technique known as Montgomerys' multiplication, and will
fail is the modulus is even; the RSA algorithm itself is valid with an even
modulus.)

You could possibly prove a number is NOT prime in this manner, by assuming it is
prime, calculating phi(n) accordingly, and if RSA fails, you know your phi(n) is 
wrong.  However, a correct result does not imply primality--if your estimate of
phi(n) is a multiple of the correct phi(n), then  RSA will work, but the factor in
question is not prime.  I'll leave the rest to a more experienced number theorist.

It might reveal a few which AREN'T prime.......

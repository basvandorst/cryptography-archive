Quick question here. And if anyone can expand on it please
do.

Isn't it true or least I have noticed in my rummaging through
the pgp code that most public keys are all small.  It seems like
most are like 11 or 17.  Is having a small key part like that a weakness?
Also if it is a weakness then does cranking up your key to 1024+ really
give you more security.  The RSA FAQ really only covers it in little 
paragraph.
Can anyone give me some reasonable aurguments that having such a small
component is still safe?

Thanks much,
Baxter

If you think about this, you may come to realize the incredible arrogance of
this response as well as his. I did not ask for lessons, I asked for an
answer from experts here, in terms I could use.

I have quite a bit of e-mail strongly supporting my request, and commenting
on the inadequate character of his response, so I know I'm not the one who's
off-base on this one.

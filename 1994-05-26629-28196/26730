:Thanks for responding, but your answer, like many of the other similar
:posts, is both non-responsive and unhelpful.
 
Why? Because I did not cross all the 't''s for you? Telling how much harder
it is should be enough to answer your question.


:I don't want to know how much harder it is. I want to know how long it will
 
When you know how much harder it is, the second question merely depends on
your economic assumptions.  That is YOUR job.
 
:There are many inefficiencies in the RSA-129 exercise. Slower machines than
:an adversary of the sort I mention would have were used. They were used only
 
So? What has that got to do with anything? The issue is price/performance.
Those slower machines were cheap.

:a small part of the elapsed calendar time. They were not custom
:state-of-the-art for the task.
 
Again, this is irrelevent.

The issue isn't whether it can be done in any specific time, the issue is
HOW MUCH ARE YOU WILLING TO SPEND ON IT???

Give me a figure, in U.S. dollars, and I will tell you how long a 512
bit key will take with that amount of hardware.  I will give only a guess
within a factor of 50 how long 1024 bits will take. We don't know enough
to accurately estimate the latter.


:I'm afraid what I'm seeing so far are bald assertions, supported by "off the

Why don't you do the arithmetic yourself and stop whining.

If knowing how much harder it is, you can't translate dollars into time,
then you should probably go back to school. It is grade-school arithmetic.
It depends only on your assumptions about price/performance.

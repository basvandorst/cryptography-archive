                    VIACRYPT POLICY STATEMENT

     ViaCrypt(tm) PGP(tm) compatibility with MIT PGP Version 2.6

                         27 May 1994

     This policy statement may be reproduced and redistributed
as long as it is done so in its entirety and without alteration.

     On 24 May 1994, The Massachusetts Institute of Technology
began distribution of PGP Version 2.6 which incorporates the
RSAREFTM Cryptographic Toolkit and is licensed for personal
noncommercial use along with other restrictions.  MIT stated that
to protect RSADSI's intellectual property rights in public key
technology, PGP V2.6 is designed so that messages it creates
after 1 September 1994 will be unreadable by earlier versions of
PGP, which includes ViaCrypt PGP V2.4.  PGP V2.6 will, however,
always be able to read messages generated by ViaCrypt PGP V2.4.

     It is ViaCrypt's policy to make ViaCrypt PGP interoperable
with both ViaCrypt PGP V2.4 as well as with MIT's release of PGP
V2.6.  Therefore ViaCrypt will soon release ViaCrypt PGP V2.7
which will contain new features found in PGP V2.6 and will accept
messages created by ViaCrypt PGP V2.4 as well as those created by
PGP V2.6.

     For messages created by ViaCrypt PGP V2.7, either the
present format compatible with ViaCrypt 2.4 or the new format
which will be produced by PGP V2.6 after 1 September 1994, can be
selected.  Because PGP V2.6 is licensed for personal
noncommercial use, after 1 September 1994 the new format is
expected to come into wide use.  ViaCrypt strongly urges all
ViaCrypt PGP users to upgrade to ViaCrypt PGP V2.7 and to the new
format. 

     A ViaCrypt PGP V2.7 upgrade package will be made available
to registered users of ViaCrypt PGP V2.4 at a nominal charge of
$10 (which includes shipping and handling).  Effective the date
of this notice and until ViaCrypt PGP V2.7 begins shipping, all
new purchasers of ViaCrypt PGP V2.4 will automatically receive a
free ViaCrypt PGP V2.7 upgrade package.

The black pot, David Sternlight <david@sternlight.com> proclaimed:

}If you think about this, you may come to realize the incredible arrogance of
}this response as well as his. I did not ask for lessons, I asked for an
}answer from experts here, in terms I could use.

The fact that you have asked does not obligate anyone to answer.

This is not your private think tank.  If nobody has the spare time
to answer your question for free, perhaps you could hire it done.
(You are familiar with this economic system, right???)

This message is a reply to some questions about "Applied Cryptogtaphy",
a book. This header is included so that you can skip uninteresting
messages.

For my birthday (March 6), I recieved a 1994 copy of Applied
Cryptography.  It matches the ISBN number, and the copyright is 1994.
-> 1.: Does anybody already have this "new" book?
Yes
-> 2.: Does it contain corrections of the many errors mentioned here?
I'm not sure. the only error I saw [here] was with the time to do
something (I believe it was factor), and no one confirmed wether it was
in the book or by the poster.
-> 3.: Message <2qrbs4$2fs@qualcomm.com> says that there is some trouble
->     with the disc contained in this book. Is the "new" book without
->     this disc?
-> 4.: If the disc is missing/modified is it still possible to make full
->     use of this book?
The disk is available seperatly through the mail.  $44.95 for the
book+$30 for the disk=$74.95, which is expensive for a book, but ok for
cryptography.  The disk has 23 symmetric algorithms (several more if you
count the different versions of each), 5 public key algorithms, 10
one-way hash functions, 4 complete systems (including PGP), prime number
generators, wordperfect password crack, etc.  These numbers may be off
by one or so, as I counted these by hand in a long list of what's on the
disk.  Anyways, the book is well written, but it lacks in several areas.
It is useful without the disk, as it includes over a hundred pages of
source....  BTW, does anybody know of a book where I can learn
cryptanalysis in some detail?  Preferably one that I can check out
through an inter-university loan, and prefrably with source code
(easier to read than English for me. I know C, Pascal, IBM
Assembler, Basic, REXX, etc. but can understand many others)...

Jim Thomas posts one of his typical messages, which we've seen many times
before. In it he avoids the issue, changes the subject, blows a lot of
smoke, and calls names.

But what he does not do is refute my assertion that his statement that CPSR
has published how they checked the petition's signatures, or that they even
did beyond acknowledging each one via e-mail, is false.

To this day the CPSR people involved, who have now gone on to other jobs,
have not provided any material showing they've done any careful checks at
all of the signatures.

All the smoke and name-calling in the world by Thomas cannot cover over this
fact.

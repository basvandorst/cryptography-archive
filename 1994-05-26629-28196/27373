In the 1994 May 7 Science News (v. 145, n.19) Ivars Peterson
reports on the cracking of RSA-129.  In the last paragraph he makes
reference to a new result by Peter W. Shor of AT&T Bell Labs that
proves:
   ... that factoring is "easy" when done on a special type
   of computer operating according to quantum mechanical
   principles.  Although such a quantum computer does not yet
   exist, this finding has shaken the cryptographic community.

In all the brouhaha over the cracking of RSA-129 I've missed this
result (unless he's referring to the April Fools' messages about
multiple universes).  Anyone out there have more information?

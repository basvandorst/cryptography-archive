: Eh?  Schneier claims that using low values of e is insecure....  "Hastad

: ... Moral: Choose large values for e and d."  This is in Applied
: Cryptography p. 287.  There's a reference to a paper in the CRYPTO '85
: proceedings, so this can't be anything recent.  Have I missed something?

I've heard several people saying this recently; now I know where they
got the idea from!  In fact, Hastad said nothing of the sort.  The use
of RSA with small exponents is secure, but is subject to what is known
as the small exponent protocol failure.  This occurs when the _same
message_ (or very similar messages; it's not sufficient simply to add
timestamps to make them different) is sent to M users, with M >= e,
the exponent used for encryption.  The Chinese remainder theorem can
then be used to extract the message.  The easy solution to this is not
to encrypt the actual message to be sent, but instead to encrypt a
randomly generated key to be used in a conventional cryptosystem.  As
this is exactly what small exponent RSA is commonly used for, there
isn't any real problem.

People, this is the *NET*.  We don't need to worry about *exporting*.

You want software in another country? easy!

1) Write a spec for what you want it to do.

2) Provide test cases to test whether it does so.

3) Advertise for a programmer to implement it in each jurisdiction.

Alternatively, ask for bids for the entire system and import,
rather than export.

Come on guys, the idiot gov can't control this, I don't care
what laws they pass.  Further, we shouldn't let them.

So, my advise is to assess the risk, and if favorable,
ignore the import law, use PGP to import your encryption
system.

Ah, yes.  Depend on the STATE to save and protect us all.  The STATE will
make that check someone writes good and all that, with all their penalties
and enforcers with guns.  Sure they will.

How do you know exactly what RSA has and how good it is?  Have you seen
the facility, and observed their procedures?  Do you perhaps work for them?
What?  Surely you are not suggesting it has all these confidence-building
features simply because they said so, are you?  Wouldn't that be something
like the Weaver Widget Company claiming they make the best widgets in
the world?

A broken record?

How do you figure?  If it won't allow you to do X to gain some confidence
of a key independent of some 'master controller', and another product
will, I would say the former product is missing something, especially
for those who don't feel the STATE or its minions do every non-trivial
function for you.  Remember, these are supposed to be products that make
it possible for one to enhance privacy.   Being expected to put ones
personal info into some master database that effectively lists the
parties who want their privacy in one place could be construed as
expecting one to help produce a STATE watch-list.  If there is anybody
the STATE would consider candidates for watching absent anything else
concrete, it would be those who do things to indicatge they don't WANT
to be watched.  The old "If you got nothing to hide..." line.

But that is the point:  It doesn't *NOW*.  And people are wanting to
use such products NOW.  Pgp fills that need.  In fact, PGP has several
handy features that RIPEM lack.  PPG seems to be the better program
where one wants to leave the STATE out of it, totally (some folks have
a healty distrust of the STATE based on past performance).  PKP is about
as close to the STATE as you can get without coming right out and saying
you are an agent of that STATE - the STATE gives them exclusive rights
to property funded by the TAXPAYER, and turns around and says those that
funded the development (the TAXPAYER) cannot use said product without
PKP/STATE permission.  And MIT's position in this rather neat little
"you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours" arrangement isn't a whole
lot better, when you really look at it, the NSA pretty much calling the
shots overall, I suspect.  Weren't those the folks that tried to surpress
publication of the algorithm, but failed, and then resorted to patents
to 'control' it with respect to the 'free' peoples of the US?  Who had
the rights before PKP had them, anyway?  Wasn't that MIT?  In whose name
were the patents filed - these patents that seem to have made a record
in ease of getting granted?  There is an odor about all this.

WHo knows?  How long has RIPEM been available?  It must be fairly
difficult to add such featueres (especially without making new and prior
versions incompatable).   As it sits, RIPEM is OK if you use OTHER
schemes to verify/exchange keys, PGP is better if you want to have a
consistant method ALL users employ to manage keys NOW.  One product
provides the necessary features NOW, the other product has been out a
couple of years and has yet to do so, and anything in respect to that
ability remains vaporware.  One tends to use the product that meets ones
needs the best, not what the government or DS or PKP wants them to use.
Especially in that larger part of the world OUTSIDE the Peoples Republic
of the United States of Amerika.  The US policy in this area is a joke
in accomplishing its advertised goals (keeping the rest of the world
dumb), it is meant and used to control what is available to the 'free'
people of the US for communication, especially with people in other
contries (by the govts own admission).  The government doesn't LIKE its
subjects having means of real privacy, and are working to make it as
much of a hassle as possible.  For that reason, I hope some expert in
the field is going over that RSAREF2 library with a fine-tooth comb (as
well as the source for the PGP version being linked to it).  The
'officially sanctioned' status lowers the default level of trust by
quite a bit.

And in its present status, RIPEM is any better?  For one thing, look at
all the crap RIPEM hangs on a message!!  Good grief, its more than a message
in itself....

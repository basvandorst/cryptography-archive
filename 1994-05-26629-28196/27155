This is the hallmark paradigm of the cowshit artist: negate creative discourse
by filtering through sophistry accreted and hardened over time.

That way you can hide your old scherotic rote mind behind the roccoco
curlicues and buntings of dead thought. The gleanings of a barnacle,
the cocooning foam of a spittlebug.

Your statement was never true in any field, in geometry it would
have negated a Lobachevski and Riemann, in math a Tarski or Brouwer.

In the social sciences it obfuscates and trivializes the living issues
of personal right and moral responsibility into dried canon and authoritarian
litmus tests.

I think I'll take your entire so-called scholarship of natural law and
treat it as a minor footnote of a curent, living dialogue on the matter.

Peddle your ex cathedra at the cathedra.

I can't speak to anyone else's motives other than my own, but I saw
the request thought hard about responding, and ignored it
intentionally.  At that point, at least, I had enough respect for his
privacy and right to be left alone that I did not want to send him
unrequested messages.  I suspected, also, during the next week when DS
was doing his (so-called) "experiment" that he was looking at the
volume of mail he would receive in response to SOMEONE ELSE requesting
mail be sent to him.  I thought then, and think now, that this is at a
minimum very poor experimental design, casting people who are
considerate and thoughtful into the same category as those who
(according to DS) don't exist, or who signed the petition multiple
times.

Just another view.  Any time you'd like to hear from me, DS, just let
me know, but I won't be responding to mail bomb requests.

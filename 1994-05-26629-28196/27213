I'm not speaking of responding with incivility, but with firm and direct
language about the other's behavior. If someone displays the manners of the
barnyard, it's not incivil to say so. Such manners usually include "earthy"
language. Saying so does not.

And it's not been my experience that it leads to further incivility--usually
the offender is so far off base that he can't get much further, and
attempting to do so simply convicts him out of his own mouth--so most with
brains don't try.

But I agree with your basic point that civility is usually better in the
face of incivility, as long as one is dealing with sentient beings.  :-)

Trust me, Carl, I do not do it for fun.

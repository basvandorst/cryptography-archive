Almost all of the articles on this group have been about block
cypher systems.

As I am most interested in key stream systems, should a group
(sci.crypto.stream) be formed to discuss key stream systems?

Some info. can be found by ftp cyberspace.com in dir /pub/ndc5

Since long combinations of mod 2 primitive polynomials can form
systems of unconditional security, I would think these systems
would be of intrest.

Thanks,

   Ok, here's a question for you guys. I have versions 2.3a and version 2.5, and
   when it comes out version 2.6 of PGP. Which of these will provide the most
   secure encryption available. Essentially I want the encryption to be tight
   enough to make it worth someones while to just go away and leave my data alone.

Given the exact same initial conditions (which, I must admit, you will
probably never achieve), all of these programs should give you the
exact same output.  The difference between 2.3a and 2.6 is that 2.6 is
legal in the US.  (Version 2.6 uses RSAREF for its RSA crypto engine)

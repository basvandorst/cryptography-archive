     Being a neophyte to cryptography, I've been wondering about the
benefits of double/triple encryption.  For example, if I use the standard
Idea encryption from PGP (using the -c option for conventional encryption
with a single key rather than the RSA Public key), encrypt a file using
a given pass phrase, then encrypt the encrypted file again, what benefit
will be gained in enhancing the security of the plaintext?  I was just
wondering how much more difficult the doubly encrypted file would be to
crack.
      Thanks,
      Dan

Well, this cipher is completely open to attack if the plaintext is known ...
if he's just XORing the first 4 plaintext bytes with the first word of the
random number stream, then just XORing the first 4 plaintext bytes again 
gives the random number starting value. From this, you can generate the entire
message.

So in fact, just the first 4 bytes is what's needed. This is not really very
secure at all.

BTW, not only is the method not brilliant, it's also *very* old indeed - in
fact, I thought of it when I was 13, but my father pointed out the flaws 
(now I'm just showing off ;-)

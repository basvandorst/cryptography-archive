Does RSA only operate properly when you can create a number that is
the product of 2 primes?

If so, does it matter if one of the primes is very small (e.g. 2)?

If the above is true, can it be used to determine if a large number is
a prime by doubling said large number (i.e. multiply by prime value 2)
and then run an RSA encrypt/decrypt cycle to prove that a valid pair
of primes was used?

Would this be a valid way to efficiently test large Merssiean (sp?)
2^n-1 numbers to determine if they are actually prime?

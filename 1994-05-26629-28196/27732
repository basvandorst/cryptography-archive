No problem. Get a "Persona" certificate from RSADSI. It's even free. All it
does is say that a person claiming to have the name you give them has the
key you sent them.

Then establish confidence in your Persona in the usual ways--get someone to
vouch for you; post a lot under that name without anyone denouncing you and
claiming they're you, etc.

I know that sounds a lot like "web-of-trust" but it has the advantage that
your key is certified by RSADSI, and thus anyone can authenticate your
messages using the RSADSI Persona Authority public key to authenticate your
certificate and signature. They only need that one key and not a gazillion
for everyone who might have signed any newsgroup poster's key.

To get an RSADSI Persona Certificate, you have to send your public key in a
special format, generated by PEM-compliant programs RIPEM Mac is one such
program.

There are two other such certification authorities I know of right now in
the U.S. (except for private corporate ones for their own personnel)--the
MIT Residential Certification Authority certifies keys for Techmail-PEM, and
there's a complete mailer called TISPEM in beta, intended to the the
Internet "model" application, and the company doing that also has a
certification authority.

In fact, RIPEM Mac cleverly installs all three of the above certification
keys, which are published standards, in your public key file, and you're in
business.

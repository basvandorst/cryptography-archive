	Don't forget time warps!! I keep waiting for Sternlight to hint
that perhaps NSA has some clever way of distorting time so that they
can spend 1,000,000 years of realtime in a time warp without any perceived
time passing for the rest of us. Since we're talking science fiction
here, why not pull out all the stops?? Don't forget crystal balls and
ESP while you're at it!

	After all, time is money, and the government seems to be willing
to spend lots of money!!

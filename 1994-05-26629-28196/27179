Perhaps Ron McKinnon is a better man than I, but I think people who hide
behind anonymous posters to violate the law or defame others (in this case
the former) deserve nothing but contempt. I do not think they should be
treated with civility.

And yes, very astute of you to notice it. Something did snap, and it did so
with the death of Richard Nixon. On thinking of his achievements, and the
way he was savagely hounded by the left all his life (not without cause, but
not deserving of the extreme demonizing he got), I decided it was time to
stop pussy-footing around here, and start calling jerks, cowards, hoodlums,
and defamers for what they were.

I will no longer put up with people who abuse common decency and liberal
standards to irresponsibly post garbage, including defamation, inciting to
(or committing) lawbreaking, pseudospeciating those with whom they disagree,
and in general substituing the manners of the barnyard for those of educated
and civilized people. I am going to call those people the way I see them,
and if they persist, put them in my kill files.

It's not chic, clever, or smart to demonize others. It's not chic, clever,
or smart to demonize the U.S. Government. I'm sick and tired of it, and I'm
not going to put up with it any more.

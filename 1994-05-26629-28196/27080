Try this in your killfile - I haven't seen politics here in many weeks:

/Newsgroups:.*alt\.security\.pgp/h:=:j
/Newsgroups:.*alt\.privacy\.clipper/h:=:j
/Newsgroups:.*talk\.politics\.crypto/h:=:j
/David.Sternlight/f:=:j

The last line doesn't seem to work yet tho... I'm not sure if I've
messed it up or if his messages are protected by some force
unknown to me :)

Of course this doesn't change the fact that none of the trash you speak
of needs to be here at all, and as pointed out by others, seems
mostly from inappropriate cross-posting and/or not using the
follow-ups-to line.  Maybe we could start a new periodic posting in
alt.security.pgp, talk.politics.crypto etc called "How to Post a Crypto
Related Article on Usenet" or just "How to Post on Usenet" or even
"Emily Postnews speaks out on Crypto!" <sigh>

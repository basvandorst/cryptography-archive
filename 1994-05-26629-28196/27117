Distributing a petition, one which is unremarkable in every way
(including the amount of care taken to verify signatures), is
an "unprofessional propaganda campaign"?  

"Propaganda", I think, can simply be taken to mean public advocacy for
a position that David Sternlight opposes; it's the "unprofessional"
that puzzles me.

Perhaps he could give an example of a public advocacy campaign---
one that is intended to influence policy and that involves 
an appeal to the general public---that he would consider
"professional"?  I'm sure CPSR would welcome any constructive
suggestions on how to conduct their advocacy professionally,

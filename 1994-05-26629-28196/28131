Those who KNOW ain't telling.  But, IDEA has no publicly known insecurities.
And RSA with long enough keys seems relatively secure...thus PGP is probably

DES, probably the most popular computer encryption system is NOT secure...
even from large industrial coglomerates.  The PC available encryption
packages beyond DES and PGP are jokes.  Some of them my mother could crack.

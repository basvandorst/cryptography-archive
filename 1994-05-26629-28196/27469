I am looking for people who makes V:32 bis (14,400 bps) modems with data 
encryption hardware builtin.  
Ideally, the hardware should be based on either DES or RSA standards.
Should be able to export to Singapore without US Dept. of Commerce
restrictions.  Modems will be used only within Singapore's national
boundaries.
 
Thank you.

Does anyone know of any sucessful cryptographic attacks on the Haval hashing
algorhythm? Applied Cryptography says that it is immune to the problems
detected in MD5 concerning internal collusions, but I am not sure if Haval is
infact a secure hash. Anyone able to help me?

Thanks a lot for your help.

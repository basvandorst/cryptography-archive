Actually, the web of trust is almost entirely irrelevant to signed postings.
In general, all you *really* care about is checking whether the remarkably
stupid posting from <x> came from the same hand that penned a remarkably
clever posting the previous week - i.e., is it a forgery?  For this purpose
you don't really care if <x>'s key gives the real name or even the real e-mail
address, the only thing you want to know is if it's the *same* <x> doing the
posting, whoever that <x> might be.

The web of trust is at it's best for conveying private material to people
you trust with that material - people who you probably trust because you've
met them and are in a position to at least check their key's fingerprint
over the phone.  The idea that I should pour my heart out and blab my most
cherished (or incriminating) secrets to somebody I've never met on the other
side of the Atlantic because there's a chain of 6 signatures linking us is
faintly ridiculous.

Still, you may have other ideas - I can assure you that it's my key on the
servers and you can tell me *anything* you want - *trust* me... :-)

Since David seems to have forgotten the thorough thrashing he got before
regarding the CPSR letter, here is a repost of the complete paper I did for
my philosophy class on his argument (I needed a good fallacious argument,
and lo and behold: David was there). I include the original relevant
articles since many here may not have seen them, either.

It is long, but informative. The meat is down in Parts 3 and 4 if you want 
to skip the dull stuff. The observant will note that David isn't doing 
what he said he would in several places.

Oh yes - I got an 'A'. :-)

Silent Majority: I see a tossed gauntlet; lets prove to David that we
indeed exist. Send him a single (no mailbombs, please) message
explaining why you follow, but don't personally post contributions to
the debate. Keep it reasoned, polite, and short, but in your own
words, so that the variability in wording will clearly speek of other
than a small number of very busy forgers.

I don't expect him to see 9,000 but I expect that he should see a few
hundred (this message is getting a more limited distribution, and I am
asking for something more complex than a simple "signature" on a
"petition", and as anyone who has ever conducted such a campaign will
attest, far more wil sign a petition than will make the effort to
write a letter) I sent mine already, join me.

David, please let us know in a week just how many are recieved. I
expect you should be offering an apology to the people that contribute
here, when the results are known.

A small experiment is underway now. It will use decision-theoretic
Bayesian analysis for evaluation of the results, a la Raiffa and 
Schlaifer of the Harvard Business School. So far the results aren't
remotely supportive of the hypothesis that CPSR's 20,000 signatures are 
genuine.

Note to those unfamiliar with this method of analysis: What is being done
is seeking confirmation, examining the confirmations to avoid a repeat of
any bogus signatures, and then asking the question: If there were 20,000
distinct and genuine signatures, what's the probability that we'd get the
results of the confirmation experiment we actually got? If that
probability is very small, it does not support the hypothesis that there 
actually were 20,000 distinct and genuine signatures.

Putting it even more simply, we're conducting an experiment. We then say,
suppose CPSR's results aren't "rigged" by those "voting". What's the
chance we would get the result of the experiment we did? If the chance is

high, that suggests that CPSR's results aren't "rigged" by the
respondents. If the chance is low, that suggests that CPSR's results
were rigged by the respondents, and CPSR should place little confidence
in them.

I won't get into the details of the experiment until the results of it
are in, since to do so might bias the experiment itself. Suffice it to
say that so far the results aren't remotely supportive of the hypothesis
that CPSR received 20,000, or even 10,000 responses from as many
different real U.S. persons, or even persons regardless of nation.

Article 3

From: strnlght@netcom.com (David Sternlight)
Subject: CPSR Clipper Petition test results


CPSR posted a notice asking for "votes" against Clipper in the form of
e-mail messages saying "I oppose Clipper". Within about a week they
claimed "10,000 have signed." I questioned whether these were genuine
signatures--in particular whether each was a real, and distinct person.
I also sent them a message asking how they checked.

That message was never answered. Meanwhile they claimed 20,000, then
30,000.

Given that some here are cypherpunks skilled at creating bogus identities
on the net, it would be a simple matter to fake many of the "signatures".
Thus some test is needed before they can be accepted at face value,
particularly given the strong feelings and heat associated with this 
topic.

As part of my message I pointed out that there were only 10-20 who were
very vocal here on this topic. Thus there would have to be a large 
"silent majority" for the counts claimed by CPSR to make any sense. One 
reader posted a message urging those "silent" members who had signed to 
e-mail me, so stating.

I decided to make this the subject of an experiment. Originally I decided
to use the Statistical Decision Theory approach: assume the CPSR 
signatures were genuine and evaluate the probability that I'd receive
whatever number of signatures I would, given that prior assumption. If
the probability was at all reasonable it would support the hypothesis. I

expected some reasonable number of responses roughly related to the 
10,000 and was prepared to be very loose (give CPSR the benefit of every 
doubt) in my evaluation.

In order to give them the benefit of every doubt, it was my intention to
accept every confirmation sent to me as genuine unless it was blatantly
bogus on its face. Given that, and given the possibility of spoofers, it
was important to be vague about the methodology and criteria so spoofers
didn't flood my mailbox. Though I didn't say so, some assumed I was going
to check the mail addresses carefully, check for bogus origins, etc.
Since I planned to give CPSR the benefit of every doubt, I didn't plan to
do that. But I wanted that impression to remain so that spoofers would
not be tempted.

In the event, each message I received was a "human" message--that is
there were intelligent and literate comments with each one, and each had
a somewhat different style. I am persuaded on inspection that they are
all genuine and I count every one.

So how many did I get. 5000? 1000? 500? 100? 50?

No. Over a week I got 35 messages.


The result seems so dramatic that no amount of "explaining away" (and I
expect there will be many attempts by the anti-Clipper crowd) can
convince me that CPSR got anything like the number of genuine and
different people responding comparable with their claims. The result is
so dramatic that there's no need to construct any Bayesian priors, and
distributional assumptions about the response process, and do any
posterior probability calculations.

Though CPSR isn't the hoaxer but the victim of the hoax, it's a hoax,
people.

If CPSR wants to contravene this conclusion the only way they can
convince me (dunno about others) is to check each signature's mail path
and "from", and actually investigate a random sample (speaking
professionally) of the signatures. I'd suggest at least 500 randomly
selected replies, using standard random sampling to pick the 500.

I expect this message to be widely attacked and all sorts of "logical"
arguments attempted to refute my conclusion. It won't play, fellas. 35
out of 30,000. No way in hell.

The experiment is now over, so any further responses will be ignored.
CPSR posted a one-shot call for messages of support in the relevant
newsgroups, and the individual who suggested this set of responses
posted a one-shot message asking for them. Now that this message will
become a cause celebre, it may tempt more respondents, but since CPSR
didn't repeatedly ask for signatures in the same newsgroups, responses
stimulated by this message wouldn't count anyway.

I'm done with this topic, and don't plan to reply to any messages
attacking me, the approach, the data, or the comments here. I do not
intend to enter an argument about this. I am satisfied, and if others
aren't, they're certainly entitled to their opinions.

Note than in an attempt to keep hysterical responses out of the
newsgroups. I've placed "poster" in the Reply To: Field hopefully to
create a pause for thought. Responses will go to me as e-mail unless the
respondent edits the header field of his reply to make it post to the
various newsgroups. As I've said, I don't plan to reply to these
responses, though I do read my mail.

**************************************************
*****Part 2 - Argumentative Device Commentary*****
**************************************************
 
(a) "because there is no legal signature, and because there is no
protection against cheating."

These warranting connectives mark David Sternlight's main argument. 

IF there is no legal signature, and /or there is no protection against
cheating THEN the anti-Clipper petition is invalid.

(b) "It's not a nit if they lie to the general public about what they
actually have, "

Here the warranting connective is used to link (an unstated) conclusion
about the CPSR's call for letters to the conditional "if they lie".

(c) "I think that number so unlikely (if it was obtained via the net
here) that I'm almost willing to put money that many are crude
forgeries."

 It is less than obvious the actual moves being made in this sentence.

 There is an guarded argumentive performative being made conditionally
with a conversational implication of assurance from the argumentative
performative.

(d) "suddenly firing off a "signature" message to CPSR."

The scare quotes used here denote that the messages do not (at least in
the author's opinion) actually qualify as signatures.

(e) "I see a tossed gauntlet"

Non-literal rhetoric intended to communicate that a challenge has been
made.

(f) "reasoned, polite,"

Evaluative terms used to indicate positive aspects desired. Alternative
opposites could have been "Irrational" and "rude".

(g) "I don't expect him to see 9,000 but I expect that "

This argumentative performative states this authors expectations
regarding the confirmation letter request.

(h) simple "signature" on a "petition"

Rhetorical use of scare quotes indicates authors lack of belief that they
are the most accurately descriptive terms for the actual e-mail letters
and the CPSR letter.

(h) "as anyone who has ever"

Assuring that fewer people will write letters than will sign petitions.

(i) "I sent mine already"

An assurance that the author did indeed send in a letter.


(j) "I expect you should be offering "

An argumentative performative.

(k) "I doubt that very much"

Another argumentive performative.

(l) "signatures"

A repeat of the earlier scare quote usage to imply that they are being
treated as signatures when they are not.

(m) "I give you a guarantee that most are forgeries."

This first appears to be an argumentative performative. But it has
trouble as an AP because a guarantee usually implies some renumeration if
the guaranteed item fails to meet the specification. No promised
renumeration is evident. Instead it is used as an equivalent for "I am
sure" - which is an assuring term.

(n) "If there were 20,000 distinct and genuine signatures, what's the
probability"
 "If that probability is very small, it does not support the
hypothesis that there actually were 20,000 distinct and genuine
signatures."

The if's here are used to make an extended logic chain that is inverted
to determine the truth of the if clause regarding there being 20,000
distinct and genuine signatures.

(o) "rigged" by those "voting". 

Use of scare quotes to express the actual acts using more common
analogous events while noting that the acts actually have significant
differences from the analogies.

(Premise) "If the chance is high, that suggests that CPSR's results
aren't
"rigged" by the respondents."
 "If the chance is low, that suggests that CPSR's results were rigged
by the respondents, "

The warranting connectives are used to connect the possible results to
the conclusions regarding the validity of the CPSR's claimed numbers of
respondents.

(q) I won't get into the details of the experiment[...], since to do so
might bias the experiment itself."
 
This is a questionable move that uses the warranting connective to argue
in a self-sealing way that the details of the argument should not be
revealed.

It blocks meta-arguments about whether or not revealing the details would
actually bias the experiment, since there is no way to know whether it
would bias it without knowing the details of the experiment. It may be a
legitimate point, but it may just be an abusive assurance of "trust me -
I know what I'm doing."

(r) "CPSR posted a notice asking for "votes" against Clipper" in the form
of e-mail messages saying "I oppose Clipper""

The use of scare quotes marks David Sternlights rephrasing of the actual
request. It may be a deceptive usage because a reader who was not aware
that the original notice did not ask for "votes" (non-rhetorical verbatim
quote) might misapprehend that the original notice did ask for "votes"
(non-rhetorical verbatim quote). Particularly with the following verbatim
quote of "I oppose Clipper" in the same sentence without distinguishing
between the two different usages of quotes.


(s) "I also sent them a message asking how they checked. That message was
never answered." 

Assurances of both of that he did write them a letter and that they did
not respond.

(t) "Given that some here are cypherpunks [ . . . ], it would be a simple
matter to . . ."

"Given that" is used synonymously with "Since" or "If" here and so is a
warranting connective. Cypherpunks is used as connoting a negative view
of some highly skilled users of the net he considers to be involved in
legally questionable activities.

(u) "fake many of the "signatures"". 

Another rhetorical use of scare quotes to deny that the e-mail messages
could be considered actual signatures.

(v) "Thus some test is needed"

Thus is used to connect the conclusion of (t) with the need for
validating of the respondents to the CPSR call for letters.

(w) "the strong feelings and heat associated with this topic."

Heat is likely an double entre allusion to the USENET practice of
"flaming" people with differing opinions. This would make it negative
evaluative terms as flaming is considered at least in poor taste
usually.

(x) "As part of my message [. . .]. Thus there would have to be"

Thus is acting to connect a conclusion to the original message and so is
a warranting connective.

(y) "a large "silent majority" for"

The scare quotes are used rhetorically to indicate a degree of skepticism
regarding the existence of an actual silent majority as being a somewhat
farfetched and ad hoc answer to why the author had not noticed such a
large number of people participating in the debate.

(z) "those "silent" members"

Here the rhetorical use of scare quotes implies that perhaps "silent" is
a synonym for non-existent.

(aa) "I decided to make this the subject of an experiment."

Argumentative performative as a past action.

(ab) "If the probability was at all reasonable it would support the
hypothesis."

Simple warranting connective use of IF explicate his argument.


(ac) "I expected some reasonable number of responses roughly related to
the 10,000"

Argumentative performative.

(ad) "unless it was blatantly bogus on its face"

Unless is used as a warranting connective to say;

IF Ôit was blatantly bogus on its face' then he would reject it.
IF it was NOT Ôblatantly bogus on its face' he would accept it.

Blatantly bogus is strongly evaluative in a negative way.

(ae) "Given that, and given the possibility of spoofers, it was
important to be vague about the methodology and criteria so spoofers
didn't flood my mailbox."

ÔGiven that' is used here equivalently to "IF".

(af) "Though I didn't say so, some assumed I was going to check
the mail addresses carefully, check for bogus origins, etc. Since I
planned to give CPSR the benefit of every doubt, I didn't plan to do
that. But I wanted that impression to remain so that spoofers would
not be tempted."

Discounting move against the possible claim that David Sternlight failed
to follow his own criteria of using a method having a reasonable level
of confidence against fakery.

The use of carefully is evaluative and could be contrasted with
Ôcarelessly' to show that it is a positive evaluation. The use of the
word bogus is not a neutral way to describe falsified origin points for
messages but a negative evaluative term.

(ag) "was a "human" message"

Explicitly rhetorical use of scare quotes to indicate the non-standard
usage of human to mean "not generated by a computer". In particular, not
generated by an automatic e-mail generating program.


(ah) "Intelligent and literate"

Positive evaluative terms designed to contrast with "mechanical" or
"unintelligent".

(ai) "I am persuaded on inspection that they are all genuine and I count
every one."

Argumentative performative. Here he states that he accepts all the posts
he received as genuine.

(aj) "So how many did I get. 5000? 1000? 500? 100? 50?"

Rhetorical question. Form is possibly deceptive as it could be
interpreted to imply that one or some of those numbers are in the
expected range of answers. This would be a misleading implication.

(ak) "The result seems so dramatic"

Seems is used in a guarding fashion to weaken the claim that the results
prove that CPSR reported numbers are very wrong.

(al) "of "explaining away" "


(am) (and I expect there will be many attempts by the anti-Clipper crowd)

Argumentative performative with an included rhetorical use of Ôattempts'
is used to imply that they will not be successful in refuting his
conclusion.

(an) "The result is so dramatic that there's no need to construct any
Bayesian priors, and distributional assumptions about the response
process, and do any posterior probability calculations."

Discounting move to deny that further analysis would produce a different
result than the naive interpretation of the results.

(ao) "Though CPSR isn't the hoaxer but the victim of the hoax, it's a
hoax, people."

Primarily rhetorical. 

(ap) "If CPSR wants to contravene this conclusion"

IF clause - warranting connective. He is now providing conditions under
which he will accept that his conclusion is false. This is not actually
part of his argument as analyzed here.

(aq) " the only way they can convince me (dunno about others) is [. . .]"

Argumentative performative. 

(ar) I expect this message to be widely attacked and all sorts of
"logical"
arguments attempted to refute my conclusion. 

Argumentative performative with imbedded rhetorical use of "logical" to
imply that the opposing arguments will in fact not be logical.

(as) It won't play, fellas. 35 out of 30,000. No way in hell.

Rhetorical.

(at) The experiment is now over, so any further responses will be
ignored. 

Argumentative performative structure built on top of a conditional. This
move lets him ignore new evidence against his position. This may also be
a bit of a discounting move.

(au) "Now that this message will become a cause celebre, it may tempt
more respondents, but since CPSR didn't repeatedly ask for signatures
in the same newsgroups, responses stimulated by this message wouldn't
count anyway."

This is a discounting move claiming that further calls for responses
would produce invalid responses. This is a weak move because it raises
the question of whether the call for confirmation reached the same
audience that the original call for letters did. He is arguing that a
repeated call for confirmation responses is invalid because it would make
it dissimilar in a significant way from the original call for letters.
But the original call for letters was posted to thousands of groups while
the call for confirmations was posted to only a handful. This is a major
difference and calls into question the validity of the numbers derived
from the call for confirmation letters. So rather than weakening a
possible objection, he may have weakened his own argument.

(av) "I'm done with this topic, and don't plan to reply to any messages
attacking me, the approach, the data, or the comments here."

Argumentative performative.

(aw) "I do not intend to enter an argument about this."

Argumentative performative.

(ax) "I am satisfied,"

Argumentative performative.

(ay) "and if others aren't, they're certainly entitled to their
opinions."

Rhetorical move - the implication is made that the opinions are not as
relatively valued as David Sternlight's argument.

(az) "keep hysterical responses" 

Hysterical is a negative evaluative that implies that many of the
responses he expects he considers to be emotional rather than rational.

(ba) "hopefully to create"

Hopefully is a positive evaluative used to provide a positive emotional
spin on his directing replies to his e-mail rather than the public forum
his message is in.

(bb) "I don't plan to reply to these responses, though I do read my
mail."

Assuring that he does indeed read his mail, although he does not intend
to reply to it.

***********************************************************
******Part 3 - Standard Form Presentation of Argument******
***********************************************************

(Premise) I. The Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR)
claims to have recieved in excess of 30,000 e-mail messages in opposition
to the Clipper proposal following a widely distributed request for 
e-mail to be used in submitting a letter to the federal government
showing widespread opposition to the Clipper proposal.

(Premise) II. There are "cypherpunks" with the requisite skills to forge
large numbers of e-mail messages.

(Suppressed Premise) III. Some "cypherpunks" are motivated strongly
enough regarding the Clipper proposal to in fact forge mass quantities of
e-mail in opposition to it.

(Suppressed Premise) IV. Where the motivation, skill and opportunity
exists for large scale forgery of e-mail, there is a significant
possibility that large scale forgery will in fact occur.

(Suppressed Subconclusion A)
There is a significant possibility that large numbers of forged e-mail
messages in opposition to the Clipper proposal were submitted in response
to the CPSR call for letters.

(Premise) V. From subconclusion A, there is a significant possibility
that large numbers of forged e- mail messages in opposition to the
Clipper proposal were submitted in response to the CPSR call for
letters.

(Suppressed Premise) VI. CPSR did not test their received letters in
opposition to the Clipper proposal for authenticity using a method with a
reasonable level of confidence.

(Suppressed Premise) VII. If letters, under circumstances where
significant possibility of forgery is present, are not tested by method
with a reasonable level of confidence, it casts reasonable doubt on the
validity of the concluded number of people who actually responded to the
call for letters.

(Subconclusion B)
 Reasonable doubt exists that the number of respondents reported
by the CPSR as being in opposition to the Clipper proposal is correct.

(Premise) VII. Only 10 to 20 people are very vocal regarding the Clipper
proposal in the relevant newsgroups.

(Premise) VIII. CPSR reported 30,000 respondents opposed to Clipper from
their call for letters (from Premise I).

(Premise) IX. Where only a small number of people are vocal, on a topic
normally, but many respond to respond to a call for letters, there must
be a large Ôsilent majority'.

(Subconclusion C)
If CPSR's numbers are correct, there must be a large Ôsilent majority'
opposed to the Clipper proposal. A corollary is that if there is in fact
not a large Ôsilent majority' opposed to Clipper, then the numbers cannot
be correct.

(Premise) X. An independent letter was posted requesting that those who
had responded to the Clipper proposal, but normally did not participate
in the ongoing discussion, send e-mail to David Sternlight saying so and
explaining why.

(Suppressed Premise) XI. A significant and quantifiable fraction of the
Ôsilent majority' who responded to the CPSR call for letters would also
see and respond to a call for letters to David Sternlight.

(Premise) XII. David Sternlight did not receive anywhere near the number
of letters expected in response to the independent request for
confirmatory letters.

(Suppressed Premise) XIII. Failure to receive the expected number of
confirmatory letters is extremely strong evidence against there in fact
being the reported number of original respondents to the CPSR call for
letters.

(Subconclusion D)
There is extremely strong evidence against there being a large Ôsilent
majority' opposed to the Clipper proposal.


(Premise) XIV. From subconclusion B, reasonable doubt exists that the
number of respondents reported by the CPSR as being in opposition
to the Clipper proposal is correct.

(Premise) XV From subconclusion C, if there is in fact not a large
Ôsilent majority' opposed to Clipper, then there cannot be 30,000 plus
actual opposed respondents to the CPSR call for letters.

(Premise) XVI. From subconclusion D, there is extremely strong evidence
against there being a large Ôsilent majority' opposed to the Clipper
proposal.

(Suppressed Premise) XVII. Premises XIV, XV and XVI are sufficient to
conclude that it is extremely unlikely that 30,000 plus valid response
letters were received by the CPSR.

(Subconclusion E)
It is extremely unlikely that the CPSR received 30,000 plus valid 
e-mail letters opposed to the Clipper proposal.

(Premise) XVIII. E-mail messages do not constitute legal signatures as
required for legal petitions..

(Premise) XIX. From subconclusion E, it is extremely unlikely that the
CPSR received 30,000 plus valid e-mail messages opposed to the
Clipper proposal, even if they were legal signatures.

(Suppressed Premise) XX. Invalid names/signatures should not be used on a
legal petition.

(Suppressed Premise) XXI. The CPSR letter constitutes a legal petition.

(Suppressed Conclusion G)

The CPSR should not use the e-mail messages they have recieved as
a basis for a list of names to be attached to the CPSR letter to the
federal government as being opposed to Clipper.

*****************************************
******Part 4 - Analysis of argument******
*****************************************

The argument is very weak. The critical points are premises III, VI,XI,
XII and XXI.

Premise III (Some "cypherpunks" are motivated strongly enough regarding
the Clipper proposal to in fact forge mass quantities of e-mail in
opposition to it.) requires support. It is not immediately obvious that
this premise is in fact true and David Sternlight presents no evidence
that it is true.

Premise VI (CPSR did not test their received letters in opposition to the
Clipper proposal for authenticity using a method with a reasonable level
of confidence) was not supported either. It was implied, but was not
actually evidenced. Research showed that CPSR used a mail back validation
method of checking for valid mail addresses. If the originating address
of an e-mail letter could not be reached by automatic checking software,
the letter was rejected. They then manually scanned the list for obvious
problems such as messages that did not contain reasonable names/paths
(obvious forgeries). This method has a reasonably high level of
confidence against anything short of a level of network corruption that
would required hundreds of system operators working in concert. Premise
VI is thus not true. The messages were tested for authenticity by a
method with a reasonable level of confidence.

Premise XI (A significant and quantifiable fraction of the Ôsilent
majority' who responded to the CPSR call for letters would also
see and respond to a call for letters to David Sternlight.) is highly
questionable. The CPSR call for letters was distributed very widely on
the Internet, hundreds of newsgroups saw it at some point and it
approached a saturation level of distribution overall in terms of number
of people who actually saw it vice the number who could have seen it. The
reported 30,000 letters of support were received over a three week
period. 

In contrast, the call for confirmation letters to David Sternlight was
only distributed on only 4 newsgroups of relatively narrow focus and he
accepted letters for only one week. Moreover Mr. Sternlight is considered
a nuisance by many and so messages in threads involving him are
frequently not read even by those who do read those particular newsgroups.
It is highly likely that only a extremely small fraction of those who saw
the CPSR call for letters also saw the message requesting confirmatory
letters to David Sternlight. In addition, the CPSR call for letters
requested only a one line form letter message: "I oppose Clipper". The
request for confirmation letters to David Sternlight requested a detailed
and thought out letter specifically from people who do not normally do
that in the newsgroups involved. The precise number of expected
respondents cannot be determined accurately due to major uncertainties
in the numerous factors of readership,message distribution, and
inclination of respondents, but it is clear that the audiences reached by
each message were not at all comparable.

Premise XII (David Sternlight did not receive anywhere near the number of
letters expected in response to the independent request for confirmatory
letters.), is extremely questionable in light of the problems with
Premise XI. If you cannot determine accurately the number of expected
responses, you cannot determine whether or not you received the expected
number of responses.

Premise XXI is false. The CPSR letter never claimed to be a legal
petition. It is essentially an open letter with many people agreeing to
have their names attached to it.

Following the chain of deductive reasoning from these questionable
premises,

Premise III's problems casts doubt on subconclusion A.

This in turn ripples down to Premise V.

With Premise V questionable and premise VI invalidated, subconclusion B
is invalidated.

Premises XI and XII are both very questionable and so subconclusion D is
very questionable.

Premise XIV is invalid because subconclusion B is invalid.

Premise XVI is invalid because subconclusion D being very questionable is
in contradiction to an assertion of strong evidence depending on
subconclusion D's truth.


With premises XIV and XVI invalidated, subconclusion E is invalidated.

Premise XIX is invalidated because of the invalidation of subconclusion
E.

With both premises XIX and XXI false, conclusion G is false.

It is worth noting that XXI essentially created a strawman argument.
David Sternlight argued in part against the CPSR accepting e-mail
messages on the basis that they would not be valid on a legal petition.
But the CPSR never claimed it was a legal petition and so this was
irrelevant.

To make this argument credible David Sternlight would need to show the
following:

That the CPSR's method of validating recieved e-mail has a major flaw.

That there are in fact highly motivated (regarding the Clipper proposal)
cypherpunk's capable of large scale undetectable e-mail forgery.

That the sample of those seeing and responding to the CPSR call for
letters who also saw and were inclined to respond to a call for letters
to David Sternlight were representative of those joining in the CPSR
letter in general and that he could reliably determine their numbers as a
proportion of those potentially responding.

And lastly that, even though the CPSR open letter was not a legal
petition, similar standards and methods as are used for legal petitions
should be used for validating signatories to the CPSR open letter.

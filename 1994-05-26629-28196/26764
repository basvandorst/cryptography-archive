Dave,

	Now that we are back on this issue, do you remember the request I made?
All you need to do is to post an address so myself or anyone who is interested
can send you a handwritten confirmation of their clipper stance and/or a 
confirmation of their digital signature of the clipper petition.  OBTW to date
you have done nothing to substantiate your claims either.

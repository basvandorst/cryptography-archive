The development of most of the "civilian" computers used by NSA has been
heavily funded by D/ARPA, and a very sizable portion of the market for
these machines is the government agencies.

The fact that the government procurement system does not get what it is
paying for is beside the point: the computers used by the military in these
environments is the result of a very long development cycle and is far from
the state of the art by the time it is put into service. But computers used
for cryptographic applications in agencies like NSA do not come
from the same pipe. [Aside: the technolgy lag and high development costs
associated with MIL SPEC computers is one reason why the key work in DoD
procurements now is COTS--commercial off the shelf.]

Sorry, but you are outdated. DARPA's name was changed back to ARPA a little
over a year ago. Or did they change it back again after I was at the
"ARPA High Performance Computing and Communications Sympossium" 6 weeks ago?

I wouldn't call Crays or TMCs mass produced. And I doubt if either company
would exist if there was only a non-government market and no government
funded R&D.

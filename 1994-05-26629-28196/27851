Once again, Sternlight confuses the words of the license with interpretation
of the license.  The license means what it says, no more and no less.  If the
meaning is not clear, then extrinsic evidence may be used; however, the words
of RSA/PKP are not binding, they are merely persuasive.  The finder of fact 
may be more persuaded by other evidence, such as the common and ordinary 
meaning of performance improvement.

An increase in security is quite arguably a performance increase in a system
designed to keep things secure.  It is not for Sternlight, or me, or RSA/PKP
to decide if keys > 1024 meet the definition of a performance enhancement
unless the words of the license define what is and is not a performance 
enhancement.  If they did, I am sure Sternlight would have posted them by now.

If anyone compiles the modified code and reports their modifications to RSA/
PKP, it would be interesting to see what response, if any, RSA/PKP had to the
changes.

Get

  http://www.imf.unit.no/~hanche/atm.html

instead.  There you will find a pointer to a newer version of the
mentioned paper, complete with copyright notice, and made available
with the author's kind permission.  Get It Now.  Offer Good for
Limited Time Only.  (The html file also explains why some people had
trouble getting the older version, and what to do about it.  The
atm.tex.gz thing is now just a copy of the html file, which may or may
not confuse your www browser.  Mosaic handles it well).

Maybe not.  The license specifically allows modifications for performance
improvement.  You just have to give the modifications to RSADSI.

Improving the security via choosing longer keys is but one way to improve
the performance of your public key encryption software.  In addition,
having a version of PGP able to handle keys generated with 1624 bits is
certainly necessary for compatibility with other PGP users who wish their
privacy to remain inviolate for slightly longer that 30 (or 50, or
whatever) years.

If you do make any porting or performance changes to the RSAREF code,
however, the license does obligate you to provide RSADSI with that code
and a perpetual royalty free license to use and distribute it.

All in all, it's a nice license, simple and easy to follow.  More firms
could certainly follow the RSA example.

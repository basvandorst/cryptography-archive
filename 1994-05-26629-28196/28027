I'm not sure any of this is worth worrying about. I'm not a lawyer, but
it looks like there can't be a problem unless _all_ of the below:
1. Posting the mods on the net is not providing them to RSADSI.
2. The patent is valid. [I don't think any algorithm patents have been
   fought over hard in the appeals courts in the absence of overwhelming
   side issues.]
3. RSADSI has the right to put such picky conditions in the license.
   [Lots of contracts have unenforcable provisions--could this be
   such a condition?]  BTW, RSADSI could be interpreted as saying
   'If our product is broken, you can't fix it unless you follow
   these exact steps.' I have no idea what the courts would say
   to this interpretation, but....
At any rate, lawyer's opinions or a statement from RSADSI that there
are too many 'if's for them to be concerned, would be nice.

:Well, it is well known that there are a variety of "NP Complete" problems
:which can be solved in polynomial time if a dymanic programming paradigm
:is used.  Example: n!.  By saving results, rather than using recursion,
:it is possible to make this go in roughly O(n) time!  The idea behind
 
(1) O(n) is not polynomial time as a function of the problem SIZE, since 
    the size is log(n) [number of input bits] and not n.

(2) No algorithm can do n! in Polynomial time, since just writing down
    the answer takes exponential time. 

As for the stuff that was written about NP vs. NP-Complete, it is wrong.
If a Quantum computer can solve problems that are strictly in NP in 
polynomial time, it can solve those that are NP-Complete in polynomial
time as well. 

:NP Complete is that dynamic programming isn't allowed.
 
Please explain where you got this from.

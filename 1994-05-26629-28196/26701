But how does the above comment lead to a consensus and understanding?  If you
are trying to land a job with the administration, Sternlight, fractious
comments like the above will come back to haunt you.

You made the accusation out of the blue that the CPSR petition was a 'hoax',
the burden of proof is on *you* to show that you weren't just making your usual
smear by innuendo.


: To this day the CPSR people involved, who have now gone on to other jobs,

The day they respond to you is the day that they recognize you as something
other than an idiot.

And you ought to retract your latest smear that the people founding EPIC
were somehow let go of their jobs at CPSR because of your previous 'hoax'
smear. But I think you don't even mind how you grovel and humiliate yourself
before the millions on Usenet as long as people pay attention, any attention,
to you Sternlight. I suspect your weren't breast-fed long enough to grow
out of your hunger for the teat.

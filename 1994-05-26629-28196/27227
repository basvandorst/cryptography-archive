(1) RSA_129 could have been done faster than it was (by using GNFS).

(2) GNFS runs in time  exp((c+o(1)) (log N)^(1/3) (loglog N)^(2/3))

The best known value for c is ~ 1.91

If one (naiively) ignores o(1) and puts in 2^512, then 2^1024, one
gets a ratio of 6.7 x 10^6.  This ignores the fact that o(1) decreases
as N increases.  I have a (partial) estimate of how fast o(1) goes to
zero for the special number field sieve. If I naiively assume o(1)
behaves similarly for GNFS, I get a ratio of 10^4 to 10^5, depending
upon whether I want to be pessimistic or optimistic... (i.e. the current
data I have does not give a perfectly smooth curve for o(1). There are
bumps owing to statistical variation in the numbers I have done with SNFS)
If you want to see how o(1) behaves for QS, see the following:

A Practical Analysis of the Elliptic Curve Factoring Algorithm
R. Silverman & S.S. Wagstaff Jr.  Math Comp.  July 1993


Any analysis Rivest did in 1990 is obsolete. GNFS was not known in 1990.

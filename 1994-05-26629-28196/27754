If you believe this, consider the lowly hologram.  Using a conventional
computer to convert the hologram to a projection image takes a huge
amount of calculation.  A beam of laser light does it in nanoseconds.
It is all done by summing up wave functions.

It may also be possible to use a QM computer to get close to the
correct values, in a space small enough to be searched by fast
conventional computers in far less time than required by brute force.
Complete solution of the problem by QM is not required to have a
massive impact on the difficulty of the problem.

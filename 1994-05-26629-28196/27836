  I seem to be getting the impression that a quantum computer, if such a device
  can be built, is something which can solve NP problems in polynomial time.

Uhh, would anyone like to mail me a brief description of the term
"quantum computer"?  I have been looking for that article, and I 
have tried to RTFM in other ways, but no dice.  Looks like a silly
buzzword from my current outlook...


Hugs and kisses,

-Ryan

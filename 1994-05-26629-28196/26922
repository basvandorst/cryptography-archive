	This is the description of the book cipher used by Alexander
	Foote to communicate with the Soviets in WWII.  It is
	from Foote's book "Handbook for Spies" (Doubleday,
	Garden City, N.Y., 1949).  It is reprinted without permission
	solely for the sake of information and in response to a number
	of requests.  I think it's a pretty strong field cipher, but informed
	criticism welcome.
	
	A challenge cipher encoded by this method will be posted 
	separately.

==============Begin included text============================		

	The process of enciphering messages for the Centre was divided
	into two parts.  The first stage is comparatively simple and
	can be carried in the head, and as I have stated, I frequently
	made notes in this First Stage Cipher for ease and convenience.
	The second stage involves the "closing" of the first simple
	encipherment against the text of a code book.  (In this case,
	a "code book" is any ordinary published book that may be
	selected.)

	The first stage of an encipherment is based on a keyword, which
	must have six letters and which is changed at intervals by the
	Centre.  In the example to follow the key word is PLAYER.  This
	is written out horizontally, and below ii - in line - the remainder
	of the alphabet is written (in the case of PLAYER in groups of
	six) together with a symbol for "signal (@) and Full Stop.
	"Signal" means that the message changes over from letters to
	numbers.   (***NOTE: I have changed @ to comma because there
	are no numbers in the passages used.  Otherwise, everything
	is as described by Foote.***)

	At this stage the "pattern" looks like this:

	P L A Y E R
	B C D F G H
	I J K M N O
	Q S T U V W
	X Z @ .

	It is now necessary to assign a number to each letter, and
	for this purpose the numbers 1-9, 00-09, and 40-49
	are used.  (In the first set of numbers the figure 4 is omitted
	as it would lead to confusion with the double numbers beginning
	with 40.)

	Those letters which are changed into single figures (1-9) are
	ASINTOER (arranged in this order for mnemonic purposes), the
	numbers being assigned to the relevant letters as they occur
	reading vertically


	    3   6 8
	P L A Y E R

	B C D F G H
	1       7 9
	I J K M N O
	  2 5
	Q S T U V W

	X Z @ .

	To this pattern are now added the double number (00-09, 40-49),
	starting from the top left corner and going down the columns
	consecutively filling in the blanks.

	With all the numbers inserted, the diagram now looks like this:

	 00 04 3  41 6  8
	 P  L  A  Y  E  R

	 01 05 08 42 46 48
	 B  C  D  F  G  H

	 1  06 09 43 7  9
	 I  J  K  M  N  O

	 02 2  5  44 47 49
	 Q  S  T  U  V  W


	 03 07 40 45
	 X  Z  @  .


	 (This pattern is, of course, changed occasionally by the Centre
	 by allocating a different "mnemonic" or by changing the code word
	 or both.)

	 A message enciphered in the first stage would look like this.
	 (After a change from words to numerals, indicated by the
	 symbol "signal," the numerals are each repeated three times.)

	 08 1 8 6 05 5 9 8 45 48 3 47 6 8 6 05 6 1 47 6 08
	 D  I R E C  T O R .  H  A V  E R E C  E I V  E D

	 41 9 44 8 7 8 2 45 40 666 888 45 666 999 45 777 000
	 Y  O U  R N R S .  @  6   8   .  6   9   .  7   0

	 40 45 06 1 43 45 7 8 45 40 444 111 40 45
	 @  .  J  I M  .  N R .  @  4   1   @  .


	 These figures are then split into five figure groups, the
	 third and antepenultimate groups being left blank to take
	 "recognition groups."  At this stage the message begins to
	 look like a ciphered message, but it is by no means secure
	 and would present no difficulties to a cryptographer.  Here
	 it is with the blanks left for the recognition groups and the
	 last group made up with noughts to complete a five-figure group.


	  08186 05598       45483 47686 05614 76084

	  19448 78245 40666 88845 66699 94577 70004

	  04506 14345 78454 04441       11404 50000

	  At this point the first stage of encipherment is complete.
	  It is now necessary to "close" the message by reenciphering
	  it against a selected portion of the "code book."  In
	  practice I used a Swiss book of trade statistics, but not
	  having that by me now, I think it might be appropriate to
	  take a passage at random from the report of the Royal
	  Commission on the Canadian spy case (The defection of
	  Gouzenko - jac).

	  On page 77, line 14, is the following phrase: "that even
	  if the adherent or member should refuse to engage in activities
	  so clearly illegal and which constitute so clear a betrayal
	  of his or her country."

	  The enciphering phrase can be taken from anywhere in the book,
	  starting at any word in any line.  In this case, it starts at
	  the fourth word of the line, i.e., "that."

	  From here on, the key phrase is enciphered in exactly the same
	  way as was the original message, and written out in five-figure
	  groups, leaving here also the third and antipenultimate groups
	  blank, as below:

	  54835 64767       14254 86308 48686 75984

	  36430 16824 89440 40886 42442 65967 46346

	  61730 55147 15162 29050       46380 44110

	 These groups are then added to the groups of the original
	 ciphered message, the tens being ignored, and the final result
	 is this:

	  08186 05598       45483 47686 05614 76084
	  54835 64767       14254 86308 48686 75984
	  ------------------------------------------
	  52911 69255       59637 23984 43290 41968

	  19448 78245 40666 88845 66699 94577 70004
	  36430 16824 89440 40886 42442 65967 46346
	  -----------------------------------------
	  45878 84069 29006 28621 08031 59434 16340

	  04506 14345 78454 04441       11404 50000
	  61730 55147 15162 29050       46380 44110
	  -----------------------------------------
	  65236 69482 83516 23491       57784 94110

	  Now the message is complete save for the two recognition groups
	  which enable the recipient to decipher message.  These are made
	  up-in different ways-from the "code book group", the "fixed
	  group," and the "message group."

	  The code book group is composed of the page number, line
	  number, and word number of the key phrase.  In this case,
	  page 77, line 14, and word (from left) 4-77144.  The fixed
	  group-69696-is given by the Centre and changed only on
	  orders from the Centre.

	  The message group is, for the first recognition group, the
	  fifth group of the message as enciphered so far, i.e. 43290;
	  for the second recognition group, the fifth group from the end
	  of the message as enciphered so far, i.e. 69482.

	  Now in each case the code book group, the fixed group, and
	  the message group are added together.  Thus:

			Recognition 1           Recognition2

	Code Book       77144                   77144
	Fixed Group     69696                   69696
	Message Group   43290                   69482
			-----                   -----
			79920                   95112

	These two totals are now inserted into the appropriate
	spaces in the already enciphered message and the final
	result reads as follows:

	 52911 69255 79920 59637 23984 43290 41968

	 45878 84069 29006 28621 08031 59434 16340

	 65236 69482 83516 23491 95112 57784 94110


	 DECIPHERMENT

	 In decipherment, naturally, the first essential is to
	 unravel the components of the two recognition groups.  To
	 illustrate this process clearly, let us recapitulate how the
	 two recognition groups were arrived at.  The first recognition
	 group was composed of the code book group (C), the fixed group
	 (F), and the fifth group of the enciphered message (not
	 counting the blank) (M1); the second recognition group was
	 composed of the the code book group (C), the fixed recognition
	 group (F) and the fifth group from the end of the enciphered
	 message (not counting the blank)(M2).  Therefore the first
	 recognition group is made up of C+F+M1, and the second
	 recognition group is made of C+F+M2.

	 To break down the first recognition group, subtract from it
	 the fixed group (69696) already known by agreement (F) and the
	 sixth group of the completed message (M1), thus leaving C.  The
	 second recognition group is really only a cross-check, for on
	 subtracting frim it F and M2 the result should also be C.

	 Once C is known, the corresponding passage in the book can be
	 turned up, and the decipherment follows by using the reverse
	 procedure of the encipherment.

I am looking for PANGRAMS!

A pangram is a sentence that uses all letters of the alphabet. 
"How  razorback jumping frogs can level six piqued gymnasts!" is what Apple
uses in its System to show all letters in a font, but this is not really a
sentence, is it?

Antique typewriter collectors, such as myself use "J.Q. Vandz struck my big
fox whelp." This is a particularly elegant pangram, since it uses each letter
only once.  Another is "Mr. Jock, quiz show Ph. D., bags few lynx."

Now, the challenge is out... please send me any you know of... or any you can
think up!

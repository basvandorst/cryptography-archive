Ah, how easy it is to agree with you here, David.

David Sternlight, a controversy in his own mind...

Frankly, David, I suggest that CPSR has been most gracious to
all of us to ignore you, considering that (IMHO) they could
most likely sue *and win* a libel action on this matter.
[Presuming that you would have the courtesy to stipulate that
you actually wrote the statements attributed to you, of course.]

In the interests of conserving bandwidth, and sanity, may I
respectfully request that *you* drop discussion of this issue
unless you are able to provide valid identification of, say,
a dozen individuals willing to state publicly that they believe
that a significant number of "signatures" of the CPSR petition
are in fact fraudulent.

[To avoid endless quibbles, I note that CPSR themselves
removed approximately ten percent of the replies received
from their petition; neither they, nor I, consider this
to be a significant number.]

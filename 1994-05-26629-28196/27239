They were quite lucky to get two words that make sense (just) then.
I propose that it's a conspiracy anyway (it's more fun).
Has anyone got a copy of the Times article where it claims that Rivest and co.
use 6 crays over 17years and that the phrase was "it's all greek to me"
I have that only on the word of a freind that reads the times and would
therefore like to see this.

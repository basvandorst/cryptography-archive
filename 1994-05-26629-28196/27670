Can we trust PGP 2.6?  Has anybody besides the creators  run tests to be sure 
that the algorithms:

1: Work as they are supposed to?

2: Contain no trap doors?

PGP 2.6 is apparently able to read but not *encode* PGP 2.x messages.  This is
*exactly* what would need to be done to put out a govt approved "trojan horse"
with trapdoors or other goodies by which our budding secret police could read
encoded messages.  IMHO,  2.6 needs some independent certification.

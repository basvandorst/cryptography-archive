No. You purport to be expert in this, and often post "expert-seeming"
messages. I do not claim to be an expert here. Unless you're in this
newsgroup for ego gratification, giving a lazy answer in different output
measures than would be useful is not responsive.

That's because you haven't been reading. I posted a careful message with a
series of specific assumptions about hardware and factoring technology for
the "benchmark" analytical problem of breaking 512 and 1024 bit keys. Your
responses have been to ignore that message and look down your nose. You may
be knowlegeable, but you have a long way to go to do a complete analysis
instead of hand-waving, and when your hand waving is called into question
you throw the ball back arrogantly instead of dealing with it.

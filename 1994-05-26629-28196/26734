For someone who claims to be arguing based on dictionary definitions, you did
a damned lousy job.  Try looking up "attribution" in the OED, Webster's, 
Black's, CJS, etc.--you'll find that attribution _in the context of argumenta-
tion_ means citation.  And, if you'd bothered to read the WHOLE MESSAGE 
(methinks I remember a logical goof known as "quotation out of context"), you'd
discover that I was indeed referring to this--you lack of citation to your
own "trustworthy" sources.

But your argument fails even on your own ground.  My original point was that
you failed to attribute, and then you expect others to quote those failures.
That's a logical impossibility--I simply will not take up the bandwidth with
(now) 1.8 megs of back traffic.  You're asking people to "prove a negative."
And, as far as the flip side goes . . . ever heard of "judicial notice?"  The
burden is on the party trying to DISPROVE the "common wisdom" to present the
prima facie case--and, in this context, that means that you need to provide
some proof that Mr. Austern is incorrect.

If you doubt my credentials, try checking public sources, like the University
of Illinois College of Law, (217) 333-0931.  Or check the masthead of the
current University of Illinois Law Review (printed before the recent elections)
to see that I'm a member.  To be honest, that won't show my entire background;
but some of my military personnel records are, shall we say, "unpublic."  

Finally, I would like to note that I'm flattered that your opinion of me is so
low.  Based on the poor quality of your arguments, that must be an unintentional
compliment.  (And, given the age of this newsgroup, we're all "moving in.")

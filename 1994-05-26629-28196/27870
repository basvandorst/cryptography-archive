I am looking for information on the US Gov't planned Public key 
Infrastructure. Briefly, NIST has been developing a system for
distributing and managing PKs for us within the civil sector of
the US Federal Government. It will be used at first for things like
interagency payment authentication, electronic document interchange
as well as the other traditional uses of cryptography. Later, I understand,
services will be offered to the public, such as electronic commerce,
for those who interact with the government. For example, those who
sell the government supplies can use the PK based billing and credit
to submit billing to the government. Since the civil sector of the 
government is moving toward an on-line environment the public will be 
offered the same PK based services and many types of accounts and records 
will be accessible if you hold the correct PK. Smart cards are going to 
be central to this effort and there will be certain changes made to 
collection methods that may interest civil libertarians. 
This is what I know from assembling different bits of information. Is 
anyone in a position to tell us more about how the PK Infrastructure will 
work? 

I heard that the DSS patent was finally signed out and is now official.
So DSS is real?!

Sounds like the man page is wrong...

They got it right this time.

Perhaps they got the U.S. State Department to grant export
of crypt(1) between SunOS 4.1 and Solaris 2.3, and forgot
to update the man page.

From the U.S. standpoint - sure.  I don't know anything about
Japanese crypto law though.

>QUESTION2: If it is the case, isn't it compatible with "crypt" in U.S.?

Probably.  It's quite a weak cipher.

Depends on Japanese laws.  The U.S. has no say on this subject
as these programs have been written by non-US nationals in
non-US countries and are being distributed to non-US destinations
(presumably without going through the US in transit, but we'll
ignore this, as well as miscellaneous U.S. power plays, for now).
In addition, the _specifications_ for DES are legally exportable
from the U.S., just not implementations, but this isn't all that
relevant to the question asked.

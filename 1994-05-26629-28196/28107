A one time pad MUST be a series of random digits.  What you are asking
is how does one generate a series of random digits from a user defined
key?

Seed a PSEUDO-random number generator is, I suppose, the answer you are
looking for.  However, such generators do not really generate random 
digits.  So they are inapproprate for a truly secure one time pad.

The best source for random digits is physical phenomena such as junction
noise on diodes or arrival of cosmic rays.  Obviously, none of these
are derived from a user defined key (unless God counts ;)

In other words, if you try to generate a OTP from a user key, you are
not really using a OTP...you are using an encryption algorythm based on
a pseudo-random number generator algorythm.  Better than rot-13 though!

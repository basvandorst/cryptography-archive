Yes. But it will also run hotter, dropping the supply voltage is done to
help cooling, not to get speed.


One quite forseable change would be to go to using 3d computer systems not 
2d. This would instantly give a massive increase in speed, memory and
everything. It would also be a right bitch (TM) to cool.

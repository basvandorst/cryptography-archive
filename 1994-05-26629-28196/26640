If I can put my $0.02 worth (no lawyer, just a "informatics" student in
Berlin):

There is some dispute about how society should deal with conflicts caused by
the new information & communication technologies. These issues are e.g. the
Software Copyright/Patent debate, everything about National (and International)
Information Infrastructures, the Crypto-debate, etc...

And, as no one has come up with *the one and only*, perfect solution yet, there
are several approaches to these problems. Examples are: the "Informatics Law",
"Information Law" (an approach by e.g. Dutch professionals), "Computer Law", etc.

Each of these approaches have different points of view regarding the technology
and how to cope with the problems, and what falls into their scope of regulation.
And if you imagine the different legal systems in the US vs. GB vs. France vs.
Germany vs. Japan vs...., this is indeed a difficult, though very interesting
field of research (besides all the interests and the money that lurkes behind
the problems :^O)

As of the term "Informatics": What do you call the technologies that changes
the society so rapidly? 

In the US 'computing technologies' is often used, therefore a 'computerization'
is taking place, and the studies of this field is called 'computer science',thus
stressing mostly the technological and engineering background.

In GB, and Germany as well, the term 'information technology' (german: 
"Informationstechnik") is used, in the latter often in conjunction with 
'communication technology ("Kommunikationstechnik"), short I&K Technology. 
The unversity departments are called "Informatik", anglicized 'informatics'.

In France, 'l'informatique' ist used for computer technologies, and
'la te'le'matique' (with e acute) for communication technologies.

All these European terms seem to stress less the computer itself. Therefore
terms as 'Informatics Law' or 'Information Law' try to apply a broader view
to the problems of law with the new technologies.

Hope this helps, Kei.

No it isn't, since the plugboard also affected which key connected to
which of the 26 rotor/reflector subsystem inputs. So it's a substitution
on the rotor/reflector input, and another on the output.

As I understood it, the purpose of the Bombes was not to determine the
initial rotor positions, but to look at all possible rotor set and
position combinations to find possible steckerings (plugboard settings).

And thus turning the right hand rotor once a second or so; sounds
plausible to me.


Studying the Enigma, it seems to me that the reflector, and thus the
property that the encipherment was reversable (and A never enciphers to
A), was a weakness. Would the cipher have been stronger if the right
hand rotor fed the lamps directly ? On the one hand, you've lost various
properties you probably should want to lose; on the other, the signal
only goes through each rotor once.

Opinions ?

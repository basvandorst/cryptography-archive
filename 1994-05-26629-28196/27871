	I think the 2.6 is already compromised by a deal between MIT and 
NSA where they get a lot of funding from.
   In addition to the souce code question and the Sept time bomb, ask why 
the 2.6 can't create keys larger than 1024? Is that the best NSA can break?
   My suggestion...we ALL stick with 2.3a but modify it to make larger 
keys and be sure the key servers will take them.
  How do you modify 2.3a???
   Got the following from doligez@lix.polytechnique.fr (Damien Doligez):
     1.  In mpilib.h make the following changes:
                   #if (SLOP_BITS > 0 )
                   #define MAX_BIT_PRECISION (32000+(2*UNITSIZE))
                   #else
                   #define MAX_BIT_PRECISION 32000
                   #endif

He reports that he started with this he got some warnings that 
random pool is empty or the like and he then changed one line in 
random.c to read:
     #define POOLSIZE 4096

Lets try it and see if it works. Unfortunately, existing and 
UNmodified versions of PGP won't be able to deal with this, but we 
can all fix that by making the modification and have the best of 
both worlds i.e. a large key PGP that is safe from MIT ...

	Lets discuss this option...

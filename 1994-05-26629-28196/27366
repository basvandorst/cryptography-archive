Beautiful topic for the cryptography confrence! The location of
punctuation as compared to quotes.  Shouldn't this go in an English or
grammer conference. And to make it even better, mixed in with flames
worse than this. As for the quotes, read page 20-21 in "The New Hacker's
Dictionary Second Edition" by Eric S. Raymond.  This is an old topic....
But the point of this message is, keep this crap out of this confrence.
Also, while on topic, don't reply (with flames) to Sternlight. They take
up more space than the Sternlight's original messages.  Anyways, I
usually don't flame or leave mail at all (just lurk), but a flame about
grammer in the sci.crypt confrence really pissed me off.

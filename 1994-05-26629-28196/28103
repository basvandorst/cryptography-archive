I was chatting today with someone moderately well-informed about the
clipper controversy (unlike me).  He pointed out the following work to me
by Prof. Silvio Micali at LCS on a technical scheme which can serve as a
compromise between the needs of society for legitimate wiretaps and the
need of individuals for strong privacy.  Basically, it seems to be a
protocol for extending a public key algorithm into a k-escrow system.  This
apparently differs from the Clipper chip in that algorithmic details are
well publicized.

The work was in Crypto '92 apparently, and an MIT lab for CS tech report
numbered TR-579b.

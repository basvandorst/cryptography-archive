I agree with John Kelsey that the noise level here is too high.  I
confess to having contributed to it and pledge to stop.

It will be difficult; catching DS in error and outrage is so much fun as
to be almost irresistible.  Even he seems to be having a good time, even
though he finds himself besieged, beleaguered, and belittled.

Nonetheless, the effect has been to all but shut down the board for
other more legitimate and necessary purposes.  (Some of you may share my
suspicion that that is, at least in part, his intent.)

Therefore, I ask you all to join me in the following pledge.  "I will
not respond to DS in any public forum."  (If I cannot resist the bait, I
will respond only by private email.)

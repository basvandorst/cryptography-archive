I would not trust such an "official" body of worthies I had never met 
more than someone I knew personally, or was who was vouched for by 
someone I knew personally, or even who was said to be known slightly by 
a guy who once went out with the ex-wife of the drummer in a rock band 
whose albums are in the collection of someone I knew personally.  But 
if there is a need for an official body type of PGP key signature, PGP 
has the facility to accomodate it.  It is just a special use of the 
general signing facility. 

On the other hand, if I, with my entirely wholesome distrust of official 
bodies, wished to use Ripem, it will not allow me to use my preferred 
web-of-trust type of key verification.  

Therefore Ripem is the system with a missing feature.

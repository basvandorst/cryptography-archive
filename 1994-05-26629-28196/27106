	My newsreader flutters permanently near the edge of
	the abyss, so I can't post this at the moment.

	The key used to generate the substitution table
	was changed "at intervals."  I would guess that
	we are talking not more frequently than once a
	month.  From the book, I have the impression that
	several messages would be sent out on one night
	using the same substitution table.  Apparently
	quite a bit of whisky was consumed during the encryption
	stage too.

	I forgot to make this clear as I was a bit rushed
	at the time of posting, but the book used for the
	running key isn't Jane Austen.  I meant to mention
	this but forgot.  That was an oversight on my part.

	As for cribs, I'll give you "Elizabeth" and "Bingley"

	Please pass this on.

	Alec Chambers

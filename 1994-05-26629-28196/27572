   IBM the defense contractor is now a division of Loral.

   None so blind as those who will not see.  I didn't say you could go
down to Radio Shack and buy such a machine.  I gave you a figure for
how far beyond the leading edge I sit.

   Chip manufacturers know that to "win" design-ins, they need to make
early turns of chips available for evaluation and development.  The
people who work with such prototype boards and documentation know that
what they have is not perfect. (Although usually they are "almost"
perfect if you are very finicky about cooling and voltage levels, and
don't try to push the timing.)  But normally there are things called
non-disclosure agreements.  (Telling you which ones I have signed
would be a bit silly wouldn't it? ;-) But I can tell you that the
availability of parts (and specs) under NDA at MITRE is about the same
as when I worked on the commercial side of the fence.

    Again, huh?  For factoring such efforts are a waste of time.  Some
selective grading will help, especially on memory chips, but these
games buy you at most 20% in performance at a huge cost in price
performance.  Given a choice between a 500 MIPS machine and four 150
MIPS workstations at the same price, go for the workstations.

    (Sorry to respond to St**nlight, but he was responding to one of
my posts, and implying that MITRE does not know what it is doing in
this area.  Of course, I doubt he could damage anyone's reputation in
this newsgroup other than his own.)

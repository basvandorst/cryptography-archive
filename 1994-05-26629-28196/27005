My assertion (after consideration) is that since I understand
why RSA works, and can understand the value of any proposed attacks,
I am in a position of relative confidence with respect to the algorithm.
If I use it, I have confidence not only in its strength, but in its weakness,
since any major breakthroughs I'll be in a position to understand and
evaluate.

Since I know dee diddly about IDEA, and since most people don't have alot
to say about why it is good (other than, "The best known attacks are ...")
as an ALGORITHM, I don't feel as confident in it.

Now I admit that this is a problem of ignorance on my part as opposed to
a problem of weakness in IDEA, but if you take the attitude that "black boxes"
aren't as useful as boxes whose innards you are familiar with, then you
can understand my recalcitrance.

Practical consequence?  I dunno.  I am not even close to the field.  I would
have no way of evaluating this.

Don't get concerned.  What I am concerned about is the idea
that "any number" can be factored into primes in "x" amount
of time.  If I give you a number, you can't give me a time,
and that's a fact.  You can probably give me an upper bound,
but if I pick my numbers to be big enough, your upper bound
makes it seem as if it's impossible to factor my number.  This
is not true.  You could get lucky.  You could happen upon the
factors in the first few seconds.  The only reason that people
should feel secure about factoring is that it seems (empirically)
difficult.  The difference is minor, but important.

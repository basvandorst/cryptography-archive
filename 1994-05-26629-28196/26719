I think others have posted that a 1Kbit key requires 20,000 more work to
crack than RSA-129.  So it would take 40,000 weeks, or 800 years.  So even
if and when compute power increases by a factor of 100 it will still take
years for a supercomputer to crack it.  But a distributed project like that
mounted against RSA-129 should be able to crack it in a comparable amount
of time.

I'm just guessing (I don't know our prices precisely), but I think a
1K-processor CM-5 is in the neighborhood of $50M.

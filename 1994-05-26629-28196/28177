Please help me understand if I am wrong, but as I understand quantum mechanics,
although we could easily cause only the desireable cases to "come out the other
end" we could not deduce the initial state which led to the "successful" outputs.
If we append to the output, the initial state, it then looks like we are cheating
entropy.

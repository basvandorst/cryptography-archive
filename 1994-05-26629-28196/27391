Is this really true?  Many ftp servers have a message like the following
(from sun-lamp.cs.berkeley.edu):

230-EXPORT CONTROL NOTE:
230-
230-Non-U.S. ftp users are required to follow U.S. export control
230-restrictions, which means that if you see some DES or otherwise
230-controlled software here, you SHOULD NOT copy it.  Look at
230-README.export-control (in / and most other directories) to
230-learn more.  (If the treaty between your country and the United
230-States did not require you to respect U.S. export control
230-restrictions, then you would not have Internet connectivity to
230-this host.  Check with your U.S. embassy if you want to
230-verify this.)

This seems to imply that all countries connected to the US internet
have signed treaties accepting US law on this matter.  Whether this
is actually the case, and whether these treaties have legal force
in the countries concerned, I don't know.

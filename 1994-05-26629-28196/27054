Umm, Mr. Sternlight, do you have any idea how many mailing lists copied
the clipper petition request?  I don't, but that's where I first heard
about it.  I didn't e-sign it until I'd thought about it a while and read
the comp.risks debates.  But I never heard of you until I started reading
sci.crypt (and yes, I know this is *way* off-topic for that group) and
never heard of your experiment until you started yelling 'hoax'.
 
I imagine that the petition was seen by far more people than read USENET,
and that your experiment was (a) relatively unknown and (b) ignored by
at least those who habitually ignore flamefests.  Also those who think
the petition might have some effect, but didn't think sending you a note
was going to do much.
 
One in three hundred is really quite good, you know.  You must be famous.
 
Jim

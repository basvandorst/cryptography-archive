In fact, I'm a little mystified that no-one in Europe has announced a
new FTP site for PGP 2.5.  Since it's freeware, no *European* law will
have been broken, and while a US law will have been broken it will be
utterly impossible to tell by whom.  Am I right?

This also means that the next person to sell a crypto book with a disk
attached would be well advised to make the software on the disk
freeware---the disk will sell the book...

There was an article on this last year in New Scientist (26 June 1993, p15,
"The cryptographer who took a crack at 'junk' DNA"). The article describes how
Simon Shepherd, a lecturer at Bradford University examined human DNA and found
correlations between introns and neigbouring exons. The introns appear to
contain error-correcting information about the exons.

Does anyone have more recent information?

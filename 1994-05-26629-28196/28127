I don't know what QP is exactly, but (isprime?) is in delta-P, and
factoring is in what I would call !NP.

delta-P means both the problem and its complement are in NP.  As any prime
has a "short" certificate, (isprime?) is in delta-P.

a !NP-algorithm (prounced bang-NP, meaning unique NP) is an NP algorithm
which succeeds only for one possible set of branches.  Factoring is clearly
in !NP, by the fundamental theorem of arithmetic.

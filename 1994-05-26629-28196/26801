: next thirty years or so. 

  I'll agree that 4096-bit keys may be safe for a while, but I would be 
hard pressed to agree that *anything* could be considered secure for 30 
years.  With current hardware (and even with doubling computing power 
every 2 years or so) I might even agree with you...

  ...but when you consider the advances that Texas Instruments made 
recently with IC's, it's only a matter of time before their dream of 
'1000 supercomputers on a chip' will be realized, and then even 4096-bit 
keys will only take SECONDS to decypher.  How far away is that 
technology (in a practical form)?  They estimate 10 to 15 years...  I saw 
it'll be sooner than that if the demand drives it.

  Personally, I don't think that *anything* we can think up right now 
will be unassailably safe even 10 years from now...

: 2) 1024-bit keys should be secure from all but governments, and even
: from them for the next 5 to 10 years. 

  I doubt anyone will have a need to break a 1024-bit key except to prove 
that they can...  but you never know what the political situation will do 
that might require that kind of encrypt/decrypt technologies.  We may end 
up with portable VSLI machines that handle our personal finances.  Once 
we get that, then someone will break it and we'll get something better.

: 3) The next century will see significant declines in state power.

  Hopefully.  (-:

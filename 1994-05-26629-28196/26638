Is there a standard for an encrypting telnet and telnetd, or a source
(Kerberos's?)  that can be considered a de facto standard?  Lacking either
of those, is there any implementation of an encrypting telnet/telnetd at
all, other than Kerberos's?

Key management isn't an issue at this point.  I'd accept something that
encrypted based on host IP address and required hand-carried secret keys
(though of course I'd prefer something that passed a user ID in a do/will
exchange, and used a session key encrypted with a public key).

There was an IETF draft standard about this at one point, but it was
apparently withdrawn in December '93.....

Pardon me, I'm lost, can you direct me to the information superhighway?

I think this to be exactly wrong. With key search problems what the NSA
wants, I'd think, would be massively parallel processors, perhaps with many
processors per chip, and massive automatic assembly. Such machines would
have little incremental advantage in civilian areas, except perhaps in
speeding up weather modeling and nuclear reactor simulation beyond what's
likely useful. In most civilian applications of parallel processing you get
the answer anyway, and all increased parallelism buys you is a more refined
answer. In brute force key search what you buy is time--there is NO
intermediately useful answer from using a coarser search grid.

We are told the NSA has its own chip fab facility. The above would be a
perfect task for a yield-no-object facility that doesn't need to meet a
bottom line and whose capital costs don't need to be amortized over
anything, having been expensed by the government.

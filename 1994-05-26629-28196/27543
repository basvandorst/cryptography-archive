   People, this is the *NET*.  We don't need to worry about *exporting*.
   You want software in another country? easy!
   1) Write a spec for what you want it to do.
   2) Provide test cases to test whether it does so.
   3) Advertise for a programmer to implement it in each jurisdiction.

Variations on this method are easy enough to implement, since,
contrary to the beliefs of the U.S. government, there are
non-Americans who can write crypto software :-)
One of the business difficulties of using it for software export, however,
is that you need to have business partners in each of your non-US
markets do the work of packaging your non-encryption software along
with the non-US-written crypto package.  For some applications, this
isn't too annoying, but for shrink-wrap systems it's far more trouble
than just getting people to market and distribute your products.


   Alternatively, ask for bids for the entire system and import,
   rather than export.  [...]
   So, my advise is to assess the risk, and if favorable,
   ignore the import law, use PGP to import your encryption system.

Importing crytpo software to the US is legal; it's only export and
hardware import that are restricted.

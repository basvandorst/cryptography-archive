You know, this has always been my basic value of cryptology. Who gives
a rats ass if RSA-429 can be cracked after 8 months (?) and 500 (?)
parallel processors working 8 (?) hours a day? The value of a crypted
message only exists for the duration of its intended usefulness.

One that intended usefulness has expired, the decrypted message is
obsolete. A successful crypt is NOT based on whether it is cracked but
on WHETHER it is cracked in the time that it is useful.

Think about it.

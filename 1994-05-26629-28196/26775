The experiment you suggested was done. It produced singularly unpersuasive
results, and a lot of heat and name calling from those who didn't like it.
The results it produced were:

In a time interval comparable to the one in which CPSR reported 10,000
"signatures" I got about 30 such messages (confirmations);

In a time interval comparable to the one in which CPSR reported another
10,000, I got about another 30.

I counted every response I got as valid and didn't even try to check
them--thus giving every benefit I could to your notion.

I was not persuaded, and those who don't like my views on Clipper and HATED
the results I got then spent a lot of time arguing that it didn't prove
anything.

I am not going to reargue any of the substance of the Clipper debate because
I think it to be a done deal. Check out the Leahy hearings tomorrow for
clues as to whether I'm right in this supposition or not.

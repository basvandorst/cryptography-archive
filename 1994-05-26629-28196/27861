Why must you polarize a perfectly straightforward discussion. I'm happy to
agree with you that in a dispute over the meaning of "performance
improvement" if a licensee isn't willing to take RSADSI's explanation and
RSADSI then sues him for infringement, it is for the tryer of fact to
determine who is correct.

Colin,

  I think I understand your argument against the current PK
mechanisms.  I wonder about two things: (1) Is the argument you
present restricted to the RSA implementation, or is it applicable
to *ALL* PK systems?; (2) Given that NOT employing some form of PK
mechanism for key distribution opens a much bigger hole in the
overall security of the system, have you a better alternative?

So, if I supply 10 volts instead of the customary 5 to my computer,
it'll run faster?  What does availability of fusion power have to do
with computing speed?

I don't think that's what most people mean when they say, "fast
computer," but I would have to agree, a computer hurtling through space
at some significant fraction of C is a very fast computer indeed.

It may well be...but that doesn't mean we're justified in making the
opposite assertion (something along the lines of, "since we have
rockets, the eventual development of a hyperdrive is inevitable.")  The
current trends in performance increases depend partly on breakthroughs
(as opposed to refinements of existing methods), and we can't count on
breakthroughs continuing to occur at the same pace we've seen so far. 
Unless there's a factoring technique out there that works
instantaneously, or a way of building infinite-speed computers, there
must come a time when we reach the pinnacle of achievement--and there's
no good way to tell how close to that pinnacle we already are.

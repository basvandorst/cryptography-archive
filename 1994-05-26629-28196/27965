As you know, with clipper, bribing gets you the whole thing, clear text message and
all. With PGP, bribing at best gets you someone to say you are someone else. If I
really want to get a message to you ( rather than perhaps accidentally sending it say to
Grady Ward because he had bribed someone to state that he was you-how's that for a
hypthetical-) I wouldn't
just trust the internet. I might actually phone you or something first, and you
could tell me your key or the first 20 digits thereof. Vastly different from
Clipper.

To the best of todays knowledge, the IDEA algorithm is harder to break
than the RSA key sizes used in PGP.  Thus, RSA is the weak link, not
IDEA.

Public-key ciphers are, by most definitions of a cipher, bad ciphers.
You have to be very careful in how you use them of they leak information,
the key is much bulkier than you need to achieve that level of security,
and they're slow as molasses.

The only savingg grace, and why PGP uses public-key crypto, is that it
has this superbly useful public-key property.  But beecause the cipher is
so bad in other ways, you want to use it as little as possible.

But while it can be argued that having more links is undesirable,
minimizing the use of straight public-key crypto is very desirable,
and the additional link added (IDEA, for example) is not in any danger
of being a weak link as far as we know.

What makes more sense: wrapping a heavy chain around something and fastening
it with one padlock, or using a chain of padlocks?  The former is a hybrid
cipher, with the padlock being the public-key lgorithm.  The latter is
direct public key.

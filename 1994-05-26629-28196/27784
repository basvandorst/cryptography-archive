It seems unlikely.  In theory (if there really is anything to it), a QM
machine could be constructed which would solve any public-key
crypto-system.  I think I can show that (assuming QM machines can do any
delta-P problem, and possibly any NP problem, which seems to be the what
is going on), that any QM-public-key system can be solved by a QM machine.

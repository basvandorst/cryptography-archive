   A few questions for all you knowledgable folk out there.... :

   Does anyone know if Cyrptograpic or cypher software is available on CD-ROM
   and if so from where??

DEC's first edition Ultrix Freeware CD-ROM contained Crack which itself
contains DES.  Later editions didn't.

   Are there any restrictions on the availablility of such software on
   CD-ROM??

Yes  8-)


   What sort of material would *YOU* want to see on such a CD-ROM??

Anything and everything.  You can get a lot of material compressed into 550Mb.

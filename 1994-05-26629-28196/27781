Hmm, one should be very careful about terms like "intrinsically easy".

Well, depends on what one means by "several". I would be willing to
bet that none will be built within, say the next twenty years. Care to
contribute to my retirement fund?

Certainly.

Yes, it would be as "intrinsically easy" on the simulated computer,
assuming the simulation was accurate.

On the other hand, the run-time behaviour of the simulator may
be a little too slow to be useful.

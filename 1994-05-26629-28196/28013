Okay, so there's a version of PGP built using RSAREF or whatever library
is sanctioned by RSADSI and/or PKP.  But as long as RSADSI and PKP are
allowing people to use the algorithm (or patented system or other legal
technicality) for free in the library, why should they care whether
people use the same algorithm (or whatever) in code that somebody else
wrote?

What advantage is there to them in making one legitimate and not the other?

Supposing somebody did use PGP 2.3a for some purpose legal for PGP 2.6
but not 2.3a, what claims could RSADSI or PKP have against them?  Would
there be an actual damages?

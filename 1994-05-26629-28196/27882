Keith Lockstone posted a slightly incorrect address for our WWW pages.

The correct address should be:

	http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Research/Security

These World Wide Web pages contain information about the Computer Security
Group in Cambridge, details of seminars and meetings, and a transcript of
Sir Harry Hinsley's talk that Keith kindly provided.

For further information about these pages or to send suggestions and
comments please feel free to send me e-mail.

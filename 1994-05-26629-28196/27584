   Hold on to it...

    Woof!  This is a real bait and switch.  Does this mean that those
people who paid for PGP 2.4 will be SOL?  And, of course, that all of
the overseas PGP users either have to get an (illegal) copy of PGP
2.6, or reverse engineer it if they want to continue talking to
Americans?

    If MIT is really trying to do the "right thing," they need to deal
with these issues up front.  (For example, they can deal with the
first issue by agreeing to provide PGP 2.6 to all ViaCrypt commercial
PGP customers through ViaCrypt.)

  I'll withhold final judgement until PGP 2.6 is available.  But this
does look like a version of PGP to adopt very carefully if at all.
(For example, how does it get the date?  If it is available in source,
not a problem, if not how can it be ported?)

  Is it just me, or does this look like a 512-bit signature to you
also?  Could someone have hacked the MIT server?  Naaaah.  Is 2.6
limited to 512-bit keys?  Or is someone not aware of recent events?

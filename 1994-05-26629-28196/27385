     Errr... PGP encrypts the text proper with IDEA, and encrypts the randomly
   selected IDEA key with RSA.

Yes.  I know that.  Please re-read what I typed.  I did not say that
you should use PGP to encrypt text.  I said that you should use the
public key to encrypt text.  The bit you didn't quote suggested that
you should use the results of that encryption to go on to deduce my
secret key.

     A pure-RSA encryption, in addition to being terribly slow, would be
   vulnerable to known-plaintext attacks, since anybody can encrypt the
   guessed plaintext with the recipient's public key -- if the guess is
   correct, the result will match the cyphertext.

Agreed.  This is a vulnerability of RSA *if* the message is
stereotyped enough or short enough to be guessable.  A trivial
modification of the message before encryption guards against this
attack.  The modification is the addition of a few random bits to the
message; this can be regarded as analogous to the salt in the Unix
crypt(3) algorithm which is present at least in part to make dictionary
("guessed plaintext" in your words) attacks more difficult.

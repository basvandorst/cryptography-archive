I will admit that web of trust is not ideal for public postings, but I
don't think that that is the main thrust of PGP. Signing of public postings
may be the most visible use of PGP, but it is private correspondence that
it is designed for, and where its strength is. For private correspondence,
web of trust is by far the best model.

Clipper is a whole nother kind of animal entirely. The RSA-129
result is interesting only to attacks based upon factoring.

Factoring approaches are not believed to be relevant to such
ciphers as IDEA, DES, TDES, and Clipper, and hence their
respective key lengths to not compare with RSA with respect
to the difficulty of breaking them.

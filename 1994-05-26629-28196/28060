On a completely different topic... we're moving to Vienna (Virginia) shortly,
and if you file the following address for future reference, you'll find a
cheerful welcome if you're in the DC area in the future:

    2217 Halcyon Lane (ugh)
    Vienna, VA   22181

Phone number not known yet -- we settled last Friday and will move in after we
get old house sold, in 6-8 weeks at a guess.  Northern Virginia book should
have me.  Give us a little warning and we'll build a fire under the hot tub.

Reviewing the available information on ENIGMA and SZ 40/42 ('TUNNY'), one fact
shows glaringly clear;

No general method was ever discovered for breaking either one.  Both systems
were broken primarily via 'cribs' and poor security discipline on the part of
the Axis forces.  (Though it seems that some features of Enigma made breaking a
message easier once a partial crib was known)

In short, they fell primarily to 'meet-in-the-middle' attacks based on brute
force and faulty usage of the cipher.

Has anyone analysed ENIGMA and/or SZ 40/42 in terms of absolute security?  How
useable are they today?  Are they useable as the starting point for a new(er)
cryptographic system?

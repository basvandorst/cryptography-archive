Maybe you should add to your gratuitous list of awards, positions,
degrees, and other useless amenities - the ability to sniff out new
Einsteins.  I can imagine that the government would be interested in
such a service so it could snatch them up young and brainwash them
into beleiving that the bigger government is the better.

Also, if you could explain what kind of twisted meaning you assign to
the word "fact".  Is it a fact because you believe it?  Is it a fact
because you beleive that JB believes it?  Or maybe it's based on some
social science "research"; what a joke.

I am amazed that you can justify - even to yourself - who might be a
nut and who might be a genius.  Well, maybe you need to have people in
thier little boxes so you aren't scared by them.  With your reasoning,
I will just state that you are sexually frustrated.  This way, every
possible rebuttal you could make would be attributed to your
frustration.

You may be intelligent - I don't pretend to know, but the size of your
ego is rather disgraceful.

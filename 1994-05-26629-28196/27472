Wrong on both counts. You fail to distinguish between IBM the Defense
Contractor (can you say KMPD?), and IBM the civilian equipment vendor.

It is quite wrong that you can buy a desktop machine 6 months after getting
preliminary performance results from a new chip design. Maybe after getting
sampling quantites, maybe not. You seem to be quite unfamiliar, for someone
working at MITRE, with these matters.

Finally, NSA has, someone here says, their own chip fab factory and can run
with yields that would be so uneconomical for commercial use that no
commercial vendor would produce chips--but the NSA might be willing to take
such low yields to get some super-parallel, super-fast machine that would
drive a commercial chip fab into bankruptcy even for sampling quantities at
such yields.

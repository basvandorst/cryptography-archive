I'm looking for some examples of paired plaintext/ciphertext/key for the
Enigma machine. If any readers of this group have such examples, please
could they let me know?


The only example I've found so far is the one in an article by Deavours & Kruh
in Cryptologia (October 1990).  Unfortunately, this article doesn't say which
set of rotors was used. I tried decrypting their example with the usual 
Wehrmacht rotor set (as described in ``Machine Cryptography and Modern
Cryptanalysis'' by Deavours and Kruh and also in the article by Churchhouse
in Bulletin of the IMA, September 1993), but I didn't get the expected 
plaintext. Either a different rotor set was used for this example or I'm doing
something wrong...


Samples of the Lorenz SZ 42 or the Siemens T 52 would also be most welcome;
however, in view of the communications links on which these machines were
used I expect all the ciphertext is still classified.

Thanks in advance,

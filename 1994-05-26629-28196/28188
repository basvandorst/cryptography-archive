You could pick up many of the technical docs on Kerberos from the
project athena dist site at MIT.  FTP to something like (I can't remember
exactly but here it goes)  ftp.athena-dist.mit.edu
If that is wrong try searching around any of the MIT FTP sites and most
will at least point to or have a readme telling you where to find it.
(I did a paper on Kerberos and I pulled down the Windows version just to
check it out from the site mentioned above)

Not so if you feed back the whole 64 (or 256) bit block.

A good block cipher with n bit blocks maps each key to a
permutation on the set of all 2**n such blocks.  If the
cipher is good, these permutations should approximate ones
chosen at random (uniform distribution) from the set of all
(2**n)! such permutations.

A random permutation on a set of N elements (here N=2**n)
has an expected cycle length of N/2 + 1/2.

Thus OFB mode has a reasonably long expected cycle length if
you feed back the entire block.  With 64 bit blocks its
about 2**63, with 256 bit blocks about 2**255.

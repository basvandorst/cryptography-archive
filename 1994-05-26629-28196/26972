The public keyserver running on martigny.ai.mit.edu will be unavailable
starting Thursday, May 5, 1994 at approximately 9am EDT.  

During the coming week, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology will
begin formally distributing PGP 2.5, a new version of PGP that is
based on the RSAREF 2.0 cryptographic toolkit, under license from RSA
Data Security, Inc., dated March 16, 1994.  When that distribution
becomes available, the keyserver will return running PGP 2.5.  At that
time, the keyserver will no longer accept keys that are identified as
having been created by versions of PGP lower than 2.4.  (PGP 2.4 is
Viacrypt PGP.)

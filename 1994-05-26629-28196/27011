At 30 million pounds per solution, I wonder how many mischievous 
postings it will take to bankrupt the NSA, or the US government (already 
insolvent by all accounts).  

The moral of the above is: if you want your 1024 bit key to be safe, use 
it a lot.  Use a bunch of different ones.  Encrypt everything.  If you 
haven't anything important to send, send each other encrypted nonsense, 
preferably by anonymous server.  Let's have a little hubba hubba out 
there.  

The more noise there is, the more time and equipment will be wasted on 
reading junk, and the less sense key cracking will make in dollar terms.  
The laws of economics may yet be more effective than the constitution.

I know this has been said before, but I feel it bears repeating:
Unless one of the choices of random number generators is a hardware
box, an open mic, keystroke measuring or some such method, then
your numbers are not random and your program does not generate a 
one time pad.  Likewise if you re-use *any* of the key material
in *any* way, masked or not.

If you want your program to be strong, I'd suggest defaulting to
a *real* random number source with stern warnings about the
other Psuedo random choices.  Also, default to destroying (wiping)
the key as you go, with *really* nasty warnings if the user choses
not to.

Any attack on the output of your program will necessarily center
on the method used to generate the key stream.  If a PRNG was used
cracking the output may still be hard, but it will be possible.  If
you use a real random source, it should be impossible to crack the
output.

Otherwise - good luck, I think it will be an interesting program,
especially the childrens game part!  You might want to add the ability
to create two distinct key streams, one for sending messages, one
for receiving.  Again, good luck.

Perhaps there a trivial factoring algorithm that will be uncovered in a few
years.  Perhaps differential cryptanalysis will crack IDEA in a few years.
No current encryption algorithm is based on a firm lower-bound of
difficulty, so all the confidence we have in them is due to many extremely
clever people having failed to crack them.  Given this, I don't see how you
can judge RSA to be stronger, in some sense, than IDEA.  Granted, you don't
know the operation of IDEA, but do you have any intuition as to why
factoring is so difficult, in spite of primality-testing being so easy?

Right, and someone could happen to guess your IDEA key after a few tries as
well.

Later,

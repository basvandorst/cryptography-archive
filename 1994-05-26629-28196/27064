I'm not from your alma mater - this is a guest account that MIT graciously 
provides.  By chance, did you learn your debating skills at ol' MIT?
I really like the persuasive way you assert my inferiority.  Oh BTW, commas
should go inside the double-quotes.

I also notice that you didn't answer my question (big suprise there).  If 
Clipper is a done deal, then why do you give a dman about the CPSR petition?

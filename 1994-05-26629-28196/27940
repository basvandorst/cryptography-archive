I sent mail to Jeffrey Schiller at MIT a while ago, expressing interest
in PGP 2.6 and asking a few questions about how/why it was developed,
who was involved, and who Jeffrey Schiller is.  I have not received any
response.

Does anybody have any information about these things?  I'm not going to
trust a program released without information about its history and
development, even if I do read the source.

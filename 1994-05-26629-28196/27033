Thanks very much.  This is clear and useful.  Like Mr. Sternlight, I
have been unable to collect the data up into a reasonable estimate.
You shouldn't suppose your primary contribution is the arithmetic -
your real contribution is the assumptions: every time I considered
doing the arithmetic, I bogged down in added complexity over things
you assume away - and still produce the conclusion.

I'm so glad I read it.  One sees so little thought applied to replies
to Mr. Sternlight - two messages before, I was considering junking
this whole thread!

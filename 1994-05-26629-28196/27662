Hello:

I'm attempting to devise a cipher which uses cryptographically secure hash
functions (key-dependant) as building blocks. I wonder if anyone can point
me to some reference material on the design, security, and cryptanalytic
results of ciphers based on hash functions such as MDC &tc. (I have Applied
Cryptography and have scrutinized it so closely that the type has almost
been worn off the pages).

Thank-you !:-)

   I am looking for people who makes V:32 bis (14,400 bps) modems with data

   Ideally, the hardware should be based on either DES or RSA standards.

14,400 is not very fast for encryption; consider using software on
conventional processors if possible.  This will allow your system to
be more flexible, and it will not become obsolete if you upgrade your
14400 bps modems to V.34 28800 bps modems in a year or two.
Also, key distribution is a difficult problem, and embedding
encryption systems in hardware makes it more difficult to implement.

   Should be able to export to Singapore without US Dept. of Commerce
   restrictions.  

You can't legally export crypto hardware from the U.S. without government
permission, though there are subtleties about Commerce vs. State
department bureaucracies, and there are proposals that would either
eliminate these laws or at least allow individuals to take their own
encryption gear with them temporarily.  So you'll have to buy from
non-US sources; if you do that, please write a letter to the US
government about how annoyed you are that you had to buy non-US
products because of their stupid laws :-)

   Modems will be used only within Singapore's national boundaries.

That's too bad.  Commerce shouldn't be restricted like that,
nor shoudl speech...

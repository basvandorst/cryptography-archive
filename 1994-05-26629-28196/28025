Yes, if P /= NP, then certainly NP /= NPC.  But in that case, couldn't
NP-NPC=P? --- in other words, the only superpolynomial complexity problems
in NP are exactly the NP-Complete ones.  In that case you'd have NP /= NPC
and yet NP-NPC-P=empty.   Of course, that doesn't seem very *likely*, but
I'm not aware of any result that proves that it's impossible.

     Minor correction.  If P=NP then NPC-NP-P is empty, since P=NPC as
well.  (Think about it...)  Conversely, if P /= NP, then there is a
proof that NP /= NPC.  (i.e. That there are some problems in NP which
are not NP complete.)  So that "might be" above is misleading.
NP-NPC-P = null set is the same question as P = NP.

      (Good grief!  Postings about math in sci.crypt?  What will
happen next?)

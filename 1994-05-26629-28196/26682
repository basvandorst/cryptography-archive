-> (1) I do not know whether Mr. Schneier was misquoted, but if the abov
-> quote is accurate, then the asymptotic estimate he gave was wrong.
->
-> The time complexity function should be:
->
-> exp(  (c + o(1)) (log N)^1/3 (loglog N)^2/3)

It wasn't a misquote.  I checked and it does indeed say:
        1/3           2/3
  (ln n)   *(ln(ln n))
e
However, it states that this is accurate for numbers larger than 120
digits, and that there are special cases when this is inaccurtate (such
as 5^523-1 (note: even though ^ represents a bit-wise shift in C, I use
it to represent "to the power of")).  It may have been fixed in a more
recent version, even though mine is from 1994.  Also, I cannot verify
wether the wrong estimate was used in the book, or wether where your
estimate was wrong, as I have little literature at home on the topic.

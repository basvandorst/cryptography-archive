   The md5 hash function *can* be freely exported.  However, if your
   encryption system is very good, it *can't* be exported, regardless of
   whether it is built from md5 or from a pseudo-random number generator.

Even if your encryption system is *not* very good, it cannot legally be
exported without government permission, unless you have enough lawyers
to support a case that public-domain software may be exportable
(risking 10 years in jail if you lose.)  The government hasn't *bothered*
anybody about exporting rot-13 recently, but they could if they wanted
to make an example of someone and were willing to risk losing it themselves.

Exporting MD5 is, as Eric said, fine - the problem is using it for encryption.

Stupid law, but there it is.  Your choices are to hire the lawyers,
or hire fewer lawyers and get a permit to export your crypto code,
or buy crypto code from people like RSA who've gotten permits for
medium-security systems, or use non-US crypto code, whether free or commercial.
There's plenty of DES code available outside the US.

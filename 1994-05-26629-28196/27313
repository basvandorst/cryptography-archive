: I would not trust anyone who made the claim that 3000-bit keys won't 
: be broken even during the next 20 years. One can never predict when a 
: new algorithm might make factoring *easy*. If we could prove that 
: factoring is hard it would be a different story. But no such proof is 
: known. 

: With current algorithms, 1024 bits will be safe for 25 years. No
: conceivable increase in computer power will let one factor a 1-24-bit
: number in that time frame. 

  Again, I disagree.  'No conceivable increase in computer power' across 
25 years?!?!?  Do you realize what you are saying?  That's the same kind 
of flawed logic that led the creators of RSA-129 to say '40 quadrillian 
years' to solve their puzzle...

  In 25 years, we'll probably have energy sources (fission vs. fusion) 
that will give us more power than we can imagine at this time...  we'll 
have computers that will do things that we cannot conceive (and I, for 
one, can conceive one heck of a lot), and we'll probably figure a way to 
send an object hurtling through space at nearly the speed of light...

: Within (say) 25 to 35 years it might be possible to pull together enough
: hardware to do it, but doing ONE such number would be a massive effort. I
: can't see 2048 bits being done in the next 100 years with existing
: algorithms. 

: New factoring algorithms have come along about every 5 years since 1970.

  This is approximately true about the algorithms, but projecting 25 
years seems crazy to me...  and 100 years, insane.  Our entire industry 
hasn't been around for that long...

  Today, we measure (or some do) computing power in MIPS, or millions of 
instructions per second...  Tomorrow (of 100 years from now), who's to 
say we won't be measuring them in trillions or even more?

  Combine super-conducting power with additional breakthroughs in chip, 
memory, etc. design, and we'll have a whole new family of processors in 
25 years, not to mention 100.

  It seems to me that your 100 year figure is approximately the 
equivalent of saying 'we'll never put a man on the moon.'

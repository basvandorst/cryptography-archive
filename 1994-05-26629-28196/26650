If people like you can break RSA/PGP with 1024bit keys, then I think
we need even more security.  And if you can't, then how do you know
what we talk about behing our PGP-encrypted doors?  Your assertion that
people on this group talk only about trivial matters is made entirely
without evidence.  You know only what people are willing to talk about
openly, which probably has little or no correlation with what they wish
to discuss privately.

I think you underestimate the importance of much of the traffic on 
internet.  I also think you underestimate the degree to which the gov't
does care what people like us say.  Hint: it doesn't take an explicit
plot for armed revolution to attract the Federal government's attention.

Also, you might consider the concept of signal traffic analysis.  If the
only people who use 1024-bit PGP are those who really need it, then the
simple appearence of such a message gives a great deal of information
to any eavesdropper.  I use 1024-bit PGP whenever and wherever possible,
so that if/when I really need it, it won't stand out.  And also to
provide an environment in which others, who might need security even
more than I, can do so without calling as much attention to themselves.

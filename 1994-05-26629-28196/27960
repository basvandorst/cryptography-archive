	True enough - but a quantum computer would undoubtedly be 
massively expensive, even a small one. And if recent patterns are to be 
believed, the gov't would bury it deep - i.e. only the NSA has one. Who 
knows? For all we know, the NSA could already have one, and have had it 
for years, and it just so happens that some civvie researchers have 
stumbled across the principles, and are soon to stumble off the mortal 
coil...

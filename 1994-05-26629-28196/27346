I apologize for this strange request, but I could use
some help from the net.

Some of our faculty are trying to reach someone who is
supposedly at Euro-crypt (?); could someone please send
me the location and phone number for this conference?

Your help would be greatly appreciated,

Todd					heberlei@cs.ucdavis.edu

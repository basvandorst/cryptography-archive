   You mean me?  Got your fingers out of sync, I think. ;-)

    No, it is not accurate.  There were several features of the Enigma
which had to be sorted out to decrypt a message.  The first was the
key mapping, if the rotors and plugboard were all pass through.  (The
Poles figured out that this was A is A, etc.)  Second, you needed the
transformations associated with each rotor.  There are 26!
possibilities for the ordinary rotors, and 26!/13! for the reflectors.
The British got most of these by capturing machines and rotors.  They
did attack rotors, but I can't remember any case where they did
completely figure out a rotor just from intercepts.  (The initial
rotor wirings came to the French through a spy.)

    Now that we have disposed of those problems, which were solved in
time frames of months and years, there were three problems to solve to
get the daily traffic on a particular net.  They needed the set of
rotors used and the order.  (I think some nets used three of four, and
that the naval traffic used four of seven of which two were
reflectors.  In any case these were changed infrequently.)  Then you
needed the initial rotor positions.  This is where the cribs and the
Bombes came in.  Finally you needed the plugboard wiring, but that was
a simple substitution on the final result.  (How do you recover the
rotor positions if you don't have the plugboard wiring?  Look for
cribs with unique letter patterns, and test any match that matches the
pattern by hand.  This is what the Bletchly Park operations people
spent lots of time doing.  Once you had the first "crack of the day"
for a given net, the rest was easy, since any crib, not just a nice
pattern, would do.)

   The bombes tested all possible rotor starting positions against a
crib.  Depending on the machine, this was either 26 cubed (17,576)
possibilities or 26 to the fourth power (456,976).  Taxing for a
mechanical system, but possible.  The BOE numbers I have say that it
took 6 hours to match a naval (4 rotor) key, which implies about 10 to
20 tests a second.  Of course the bombes were designed so that they
coud be started anywhere, which allowed several bombes to be devoted
to a single attempt at a crack.

  See above.  The problem with Enigma security was that the difficult
part of the problem was embedded in the hardware (the rotors) and the
Germans never used enough rotors.  Capture one army HQ, or ship, or
submarine, and you had the hard part of the job done.  But one
submarine, or even one weather ship, captured gave a window into all
submarine communications, etc.

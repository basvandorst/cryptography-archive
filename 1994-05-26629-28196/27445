I am looking for a software licensing developer's kit. 
It must contain some kind of cryptography in order to 
protect piracy. This package must have the following 
features:
   - Node lock licensing: only one CPU can use the software.
   - Floating lock: only a specific number of copy of 
       the software can run at the same time.
   - Software option lock: enable to lock parts of the software.
   - Time locking: Starting and expiring date of the license.

	This tool kit must be working on Silicon Graphic 
workstations. I know that Silicon Graphic already sells 
the "NetLS Developer's Kit" but the thing I don't like 
about it, is the price of this package ($ 14 000) which is 
more than five time the price of the complete 
development option (C, Unix, GL, OpenGL, X, OSF/Motif). 
	
	I would like to know if someone heard about a 
similar package that will run easily on Silicon Graphic 
(Unix System 5). It can be a commercial package or from 
the public domain. The other solution is to have an ftp 
site where I can find some basic encryption and network 
programs in order to develops this tool.

	I would greatly appreciate an answer and I also 
want to thanks every one in advance.

Hello:

On June 1, 1994, CustomWare of Toronto will be releasing a freeware newton
application called "nCrypt". nCrypt provides "strong" encryption for newton
objects including notes and names.

The freeware version of nCrypt will provide password protection for newton
objects and is intended for use as a personal privacy utility. A commercial
version to follow will also implement "public key" protocols for digital
signature authentication and key distribution similar to PowerTalk,
RIPEM/SIG, PGP and RIPEM.

nCrypt also suppports "drop in" encryption modules for adding compatibility
with other encryption systems.

Interested developers may contact CustomWare about writing encryption
modules or for testing their apps with nCrypt for compatibility. The
algorithms used by nCrypt will be made available in a technical note for
review. There may even be another of those cash prizes for breaking the
system...

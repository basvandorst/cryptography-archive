Oh, come on!  You make it sound like they were using a letter-for-letter
substitution cipher.  RSA could have published, along with the challenge,
the exact number of times each letter occurs, number of words and number
of letters in each word, and it would not have made the challenge one
whit easier in any way I can think of.

The answer is yes! Somebody sent me a patch for 2.3a that prints 2.6 as 
the version number, and allows for key generation up to 4080 bits! 
Notably, it takes a couple of hours to generate a 4080 bit key on a 486, the 
author (who chooses to remain anonymous) recommended 2048 as a good upper 
limit. Also, previous versions of the software will *not* be able to read 
keys larger than 1264. I have put the patch up for anonymous ftp at
ftp.netcom.com /pub/dcosenza/pgp23b.zip if anybody wants it, it comes with 
the 2.3a documentation and no detached sig.

Ever forward,

David

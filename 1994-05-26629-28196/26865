Quite right. If they cannot or will not they should keep silent instead of
posting arrogant smoke.

Another arrogant answer. If nobody has the spare time, and/or nobody has
sufficient community values in this group to be willing to take the time to
do the analysis, or if none of those more skilled than I in this matter
don't find the question interesting enough to do the work, I won't get an
answer and will have to look elsewhere. 

I make no assumptons about this place being my private think tank, but I do
assume that net newsgroups on specific topics are a good place to ask
questions, after insuring the question is worth asking and hasn't already
been answered. My question met both tests.

Gratuitous posts such as yours and some others are signs of immaturity, not
adult participation in technical newsgroups.

By the way, it's bad form to post criticism of someone publicly and then ask
for a response via e-mail. The adult way to do it is to make the criticism
via e-mail, or be prepared for the response in the same public groups the
criticism was vouchsafed to. Thus I have posted this to the newsgroups where
you placed your little flower, not to "poster" as you requested.

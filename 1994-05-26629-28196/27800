OK, pgp2.3a is the most secure version of PGP out there. Why? Because 
PGP2.3a allows you to have larger keys. The maximum size key you can have
in PGP2.3a is 1264 bits (a little more actually, depending on the machine
you are using), but is ony 1024 bits in pgp2.5 and pgp2.6 (for some crazy
reason the RSAREF library has decided to put this limitation on the size of
PGP keys. PGP2.5/6 will also *not* accept keys that are < 508 bits or > 1024
bits). 

It is fairly easy to hack all three versions of PGP to accept larger keys,
email me for more information, but hacking that RSAREF library violates the 
contract you agreed to when you got PGP2.5.

Also, the origional author of PGP feels that 1024 bits in your key is 
sufficient:

>>We know how many machine cycles it takes to factor a 1024 bit key.  We
know how many machine cycles are available planetwide per year.  There
is not enough horsepower on the planet to do it.  And there won't be
enough horsepower to do it for a long long time, even allowing for a
doubling of speed every 18 months.<< (From prz@acm.org, personal 
correspondence)

Finally: Anyone care to try to estimate when it will be feasable to factor a
1024-bit key. Let us assume that there are no breakthroughs in factoring--
we have to use currently known methods. Let us assume that "feasable" means
being able to break a 1024-bit key in 1 month using every computer in the
world, with a doubling of global computing power every 18 months.

Hope this helps. (You may also be intrested in alt.security.pgp for
pgp-specific information. alt.secutiry.ripem describes another mailer,
similar to PGP, called RIPEM).

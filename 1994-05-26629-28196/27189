Regarding differences between the two editions.....
	I have a very vague recollection of reading somewhere that the
first edition had material that the NSA or some other gov't agency
wanted deleted. I had forgotten all about this until I was thinking
about traffic on this circuit the other night.
	I also recall that there was a paperback version
ut have no idea how complete it is.
	Cheers,

I'm afraid it won't work, Grady.  Some mid-level bureaucrat will get ahold of
Sternlight's drivel and think that replying to it could justify a pay raise,
so Sternlight will become a career resource.  (For the humor-impaired, I'm
only marginally serious.  I worked long enough for the Feds to know that it's
at least possible.)

Further, how do you know that Sternlight is any less a "nut case" than the
"leadership" we've had in DC for the last twenty years? <g>

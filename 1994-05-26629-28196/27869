It would definitely indicate someone had violated the RSAREF license,
_unless_ the person who made the modifications to RSAREF had obeyed the
license's requirement to provide performance improvement modifications
to RSADSI, or they'd gotten prior permission from RSADSI.

I'd suggest that anyone who makes such mods read section 1.c. of the
RSAREF 2.0 license, and comply.  Sending them the diffs alone would be
kinder than sending the entire PGP distribution, but you might cover
your bets by asking them if they want the entire thing.

If RSADSI objects, then you can either give way, or choose to champion
a definition of "performance improvement" that includes greater security
through longer keys (arguably true in an application designed solely to
enhance security).

Alternatively, you could define the key size limits in RSAREF to somehow
be part of the "published program interface", and request permission to
make such reasonable changes in advance.

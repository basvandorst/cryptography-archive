	I suspect that this was simply a poor implementation of RSA.  I use
a keylength of about 1000 bits and friends with 386s report encryption times
of about 1 second for small files.  Even if I assume that the entire second
is spend RSA encrypting the 128 bit IDEA key, I still get 16 bytes/sec,
 or about 1Kbyte/minute.

	The general estimates I am familiar with put block ciphers in the
100 to 1000 times faster than RSA type ciphers, but 1.5 Kbytes/hour on a
486DX33 is ridiculously slow for RSA.

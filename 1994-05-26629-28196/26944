The DOS memory modell wouldn't be the problem since a real try would
use some kind of DOS extender (probably DJGPP, a DOS port of GCC). If
you use a 32-bit DOS-extender as DJPGG you get flat address support,
virtual memory support and even support for most UN*X c functions.

There are a lot of 8 Mb (or more) PC's out there that do nothing each
night. The program would probably have to be modified a little
(exiting when someone pressed a key and such), but it would probably
be doable. The main problem is to get the results back...

A failure the CPSR petition shares with every other petition I've ever
heard of.  Can anyone provide me with *any* examples of petitions
whose signatures were "validated" through "reliable checking"?  I'm
talking about petitions whose purposes is to show support for a cause,
that is.  Petitions to get something on a ballot are different, since
they fall under very specific legal requirements.

This argument, then, is disingenious: David Sternlight is singling out
out CPSR for criticism that applies equally well to every other public
advocacy organization.  Or does he, in fact, really mean to discredit
not just the CPSR petition but every other petition as well?

(With anyone else, that question would be rhetorical.  David
Sternlight has said so many negative things about the whole idea that
public debate can and should influence national policy, though, that
it's actually a serious question.)

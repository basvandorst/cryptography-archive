A lot easier to get my bank manager to sign my key than some authority 
in America somewhere, and probably more valid.  Bank managers here 
already provide a similar verification of identity service for those 
applying for passports or firearms licences (as do Doctors, Lawyers, 
Members of Parliament, and Ministers of Religion).  

That signature would do for other banks and official types, and I could 
add other sigs trusted by people who would not know or trust my banker.  
I can suit everyone, rather than force them all to rely on a central 
authority that *nobody* knows.

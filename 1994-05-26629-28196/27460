:Starting a slightly different thread, isn't the NSA baned by law from
:monitoring US domestic traffic, so within the US even if they could
:decrypt messages, the information would not be admissible ?

	It's not going to ever appear in court.

	Think about it. If data monitoring takes place and intercepts
are introduced as evidence, that will reveal a great deal of information
about the capabilities of our intelligence agencies. I can't think of
*anything* that is likely to be tried in court that would be worth
directly introducing high quality intelligence as evidence.

	The intelligence stuff would get fed down to street-level
gumshoes as the "anonymous source" or "informant" and used to justify
other means to get the same evidence.

	Just imagine, for a second, that geosynch satellite imaging
was what was used to track down the guys who did the world trade
center bombing. Imagine, even further, that the licence plate on
the van was read. Now, you would *NOT* want to reveal a capability
like that so what do you do? You call the idiots in the local office
and say, "Uh, this is special agent J. R. Dobbs and I just got a
call from the rental place at XYZ that some <blah> <blah>..."

	For example, if you're a drug kingpin and keep your files
all encrypted with DES. Even if the feds *can* read DES if they
need to, you'll never see a decryption of your customer list
appear in court as evidence.

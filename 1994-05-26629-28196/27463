It's a performance issue. IDEA and similar can encrypt large
blocks of data with very little CPU overhead, while RSA with a
large key requires a significant amount of processing power for
any amount of data.

Using a large, totally random, IDEA key, presuming the IDEA
algorihm is not broken, does not add significant risk to
the overall message security.

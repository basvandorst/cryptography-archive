I don't believe you, Bob. Please cite evidence for your statement.

There's a court which reviews a bunch of NSA domestic wiretap requests
every year. There are laws and regulations and procedures which require
NSA employees to minimize what they reveal about U.S. citizens in
_many_, not _all_, cases. There is a notable absence of any law stopping
GCHQ from monitoring U.S. traffic and telling NSA the results.

Hi,

We have a Novell network and I would like to create a virtual encrypted
drive for the MIS staff to store passwords for our systems, etc. 

I don't want to create a virtual drive on all the MIS staff PC's, so 
it would be nice to use a product like SecureDevice on a network drive.

Does anyone know if its possible? If not, does anyone know of any other
products that might work.

Thanks,

Eric

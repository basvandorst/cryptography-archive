Hello,
The company I work at has been having security
problems for the past several months. We have
about 100 Macs in a large office, mostly Mac II
family and Quadras. We've had hard disks and
RAM stolen on several machines in addition to
external hard disks. We have tight deadlines
so people often have to work late and on weekends.
I was wondering if any of you out there have had similar
problems and if anyone has had any luck stopping
theft. What sorts of security measures do other
companies take? I'd appreciate replies through
email, as I don't always have time to read this
group. Thanks in advance.

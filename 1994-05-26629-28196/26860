Actually Bob *is* an expert. (Look up his publication list for
yourself, I presume that you know how to do that.) His answers have
been quite good and specific. He is not, however, about to tell you
solutions to specific problems that have not been framed in such a
manner as to specify the actual assumptions that you are making about
technology. He cannot do that unless he can read your mind. (Which is
not one of his many skills.) But since you are the one with the
questions, and since you have been informed what the factors are from
the point of view of the math, and since you claim such expertise in
what the military has available technologically (while disagreeing with
what everyone has said on this thread, and disagreeing with what little
I have heard about the subject from people who were in the military and
navy), and since you should have mastered the art of arithmetic, why
don't *you* do the analysis. You have every single tool available to
anyone else at this point (apparently including far more information on
military technology than others) and you have the ability. In the
meantime Bob can get around to doing what he wants to do.

I do not seem to recall you having posted really specific stuff. I do
not think that vague comments about "massively parallel computers"
qualifies. So people do not know what you want. In any case you have
been given pretty complete information on what the projected
requirements are to factor various numbers with existing algorithms,
what the various limiting factors are, and estimates on how regularly
new algorithms have been coming out. So why not do some work for
yourself?

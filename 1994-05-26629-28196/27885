Extremely clear way of cutting through to think about it.

At this point we come to the devil in the details. The question turns on the
licensee's modification of the program, not his use of it. In particular it
turns on his interpretation of the ambiguous-seeming words "performance
improvement" and whether they may be interpreted as longer keys rather than
speedup without checking with RSADSI to ascertain what RSADSI meant. It is
unambiguous in the license that modifications to the software REQIRE prior
specific written permission from RSADSI. An exception is called out for
"performance improvement".

Too bad you spoiled an excellent adult post, which had enhanced your stature
both with me and I'm sure everyone else, with what seems to me to be a
juvenile, jerky remark. Given my rehearsal (above) of the specific details
of the issue, it seems not only childishly inappropriate to the issue before
us for you to say this, but seems demeaning to a serious substantive
discussion.

If you take this tone with those with whom you disagree or are annoyed with,
you sabotage whatever pedagogical talents you have and poison what would
otherwise be a brilliant teaching style. It's been suggested by some with
experience of you in situ that this behavior goes beyond me in particular.
If so you may wish to consider whether re-examining this attitude may
enhance your career prospects.

Best;
David

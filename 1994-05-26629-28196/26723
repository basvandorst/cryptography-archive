That's the beauty of this whole thing.  :)

If someone sent in faked (or mail-mangled, or bad data in general) the
collection machine would have caught them and disposed of them in the nightly
processing.  It is hard (read: time consuming) to find the relations we were
collecting, but a snap to verify them once they are found.

Also, each relation is roughly equal to any other, so if one is skipped or a
worker machine doesn't complete the particular task it was given, it doesn't
matter much at all.

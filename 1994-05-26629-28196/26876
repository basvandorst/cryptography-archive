I am looking for proofs about the strength of various feedback
modes for block ciphers.  Either the proof itself or a reference
to a proof would be greatly appreciated.  (Presumably the
proof would be realtivized to the strength of the block cipher;
e.g. a strong positive result would be "cryptanalysis of feedback
mode X is as hard as the underlying block cipher used".)

My most immediate desire is for results dealing with CFB, but
results on CBC, OFB, and other, less standard, modes are all
sought as well.  (I seem to recall a result on CFB that states
that only a full-width feedback is secure, but I'm not finding
the paper that might have stated this...)

To forstall the obvious follow-on questions, here is a
brief description of the feedback modes mentioned.
Note that an IV (initialization vector) is needed for
the first round, before the any feedback is available,
for the leftmost entry in these mode descriptions.

CFB (cipher feedback mode):
                                        Plaintext
                                          |
                                          v
input block -> encrypt -> output block -> XOR -> cipher text -> send
       ^                                          |
       |                                          |
       \------------------------------------------/

Note: the standard definition of CFB allows for k-bit plaintext
and cipher text, with appropriate measures for dealing with the
input and output blocks; I omit them partially for simplicity,
and partially because I don't need this flexibility for my
problem under study.


CBC (cipher block chaining):

                   Plaintext
                     |
previous block's     v
cipher text      -> XOR -> input block -> encrypt -> output block -+-> send
    ^                                                              |
    |                                                              |
    \--------------------------------------------------------------/


OFB (output feedback mode):
                                          Plaintext
                                             |
                                             v
input block -> encrypt -> output block -+-> XOR -> cipher text -> send
       ^                                |
       |                                |
       \--------------------------------/

Note: the standard definition of OFB allows for k-bit plaintext
and cipher text, with appropriate measures for dealing with the
input and output blocks; I omit them partially for simplicity,
and partially because I don't need this flexibility for my

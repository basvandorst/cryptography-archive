This is indeed true - my key isn't well-enough certified to be very
widely reassuring.  And the underlying observation, that PEM provides
something amounting to a universal - and short - trust chain (to
translate into PGP-like terms) is also true.  But, as he says himself,

As I lay the emphasis on this sentence (not necessarily what Mr.
Sternlight meant), it means that there's no need to be so bureaucratic
about authentication for all.  The PGP trust web has existed and grown
for some time, while the (RI)PEM authorities have awaited ... something
or other: getting the bureaucracy in line, or getting someone willing
to spend the money to be the authority, I dunno what the hold up has
been, but it was real.  In the mean time, PGP users have been able to
pull together as much trust web as they've needed.

I am not a great fan of bureaucracies, though I'm willing to employ
them when nothing else will serve.  It seems to me, however, that this
is not such a case.

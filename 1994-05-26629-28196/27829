Can this be accurate?  I was under the impression the British were able
to get keys without cribs in several weeks of Colossus time.  Cribs 
sometimes gave them keys in several hours.

If they could test 10,000 settings/second (which would be truly amazing
given WWII technology) this would give settings in 4X10^28 seconds (about
10^23 weeks).

To get a key in a week they would have to be able to test about 10^27
settings per second...which I am sure we can not do even today.  But,
since Enigma is NOT secure, by inferrence, the keyspace can not be that big.

Echaus, you out there?  (He'll know where I messed up :)

(Are MIT thesis available on-line now days?... Or indices?)

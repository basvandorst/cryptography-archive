If you think this you have never visited the IBM factories between 1956 and
1960.

Computers far more powerful than the 360 were in use in government
facilities prior to IBM's coming out with it.

It seems apparent that you are not familiar with the history and products
made at IBM's KMPD.

No. Mass produced microcomputers were always way behind the state of the art
of computer technology. The thing that was wonderful about them was that
"reasonable" computers could be made very cheaply and used by masses of
people.

This is post hoc ergo propter hoc nonsense. Next you'll be telling us that
the rooster's crowing makes the sun rise.

This is totally and completely false. Your experience, as shown below,
consists of working as a tech on battle-robust ship's computers. In this
discussion we're talking about stuff in the basements of the NSA, GCHQ, the
French, Japanese, etc. They are far more advanced than most military "line"
hardware. Can you say "ARPA"? I thought not.

I wouldn't expect my gardener to be familiar with the latest in gene
splicing in agriculture either, but he'd have the brains not to draw
conclusions about the state of agricultural science from cleaning up my yard
waste. It would be good if maintenance technicians understood that they
weren't advanced design electronics engineers.

You obviously haven't seen the good stuff. I have, both in my work with
defense contractors, and later as a consultant.

This is one of the most bizarre statements I've read in a long time. One of
my clients, the Hughes Aircraft Company, puts on an annual demonstration of
their semi-classified hardware, and it's so exciting it makes one's hair
curl. As to their classified stuff, deponent sayeth not.

What's more, this is also true for non-computer military electronics.
Compared to the civilian stuff, modern military phased-array surveillance
radar is a wonder. Electro-optical systems would make your mind boggle. The
latest satellite technology is simply impossible to imagine.

What is true is that for some kinds of computing, mass-produced civilian PCs
are much cheaper than ruggedized military designs and for some applications
are giving defense contractors a hard time. But we're not talking about that
when we talk about cutting edge cryptanalytic hardware.

Children, please!  There are two ways of looking at this: by analysing facts
and attempting to project them into the future (the quantitative method), 
or by examining trends, opinions etc. (the qualitative method).  Each has 
its good points, each has its drawbacks.  Stick to the subject and stop 
quibbling!

ObPost: a lot of previous posts have discussed the problems/expense of 
obtaining all the necessary hardware & processor time for such a decryption
project.  I read recently about the vampire virus, designed either by Fred
Cohen or Robert Morris, I forget which, that wends its merry way through a 
network looking for free processor time to devote to a central problem.

Could this concept be improved enough to be used to find the necessary power
for the decryption from the Internet?

It's not an April Fool's joke, but it is (sort of) about multiple
universes.  Shor has used some results of David Deutsch and Richard
Jozsa ("rapid solution of problems by quantum computation",
Proc. Royal Soc. A (1992) Vol 439 pp 553-558) to formulate factoring
in a form which is polynomial in time given the existence of quantum
computation.  There are serious issues about whether such machines can
be constructed, but the physics seems sound.  I certainly would not be
as dogmatic about the impossibility of doing something like this as
Dr. Silverman, although if the results are correct, it will certainly
change my outlook on how the universe computes.

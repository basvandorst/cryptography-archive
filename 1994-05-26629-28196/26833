The best publicly-known attack, differential cryptanalysis, requires
on the order of 2^47 chosen-plaintext/ciphertext pairs before it can
determine the key, and thus figure out the input bits of a DES encrypted
message. Given that each plain/ciphertext is 64-bits (8 bytes), we are
talking 2^51 bytes, or over 2000 terabytes.

If your AI program really can figure out the input bits of a DES ciphertext
with 99% accuracy, and can do it with only 9.8Mb from a known-plaintext
attack, then you have made a fundamental breakthrough and you will become
very rich and/or famous. Or thrown in prison ;-).

However, before you put a deposit on that Ferrari, I suggest you carry
out your preliminary results through to their conclusion, and see if it
extrapolates as predicted. Remember that a DES encryption is equivalent
to using a 2^64 entry lookup table, and there are 2^56 different tables.
Do you think your program contains enough internal state to represent this?

Following up on my own message a little here...

I found it -- the result relates to OFB, not CFB: R. R. Jueneman,
"Analysis of certain aspects of Output Feedback Mode", Proceedings
of Crypto '82.  I haven't dug out a copy of Crypto '82 yet to look
at it, so I'm not sure how specific it is to DES, but the
conclusion quoted is that the size of the feedback variable should
be 64 bits.

I've also found "Cryptanalysis of the CFB mode of the DES with a
reduced number of rounds" by Preneel, Nuttin, Rijmen, and Buelens
in the proceedings of Crypto '93.

I'm still looking for theoretical results on CBC and non-standard
feedback modes, as well as any other OFB or CFB results...

While the quantity of words in this collection is impressive, the
quality leaves something to be desired.  For example, here are the
seven-letter words that use only the three most frequently-occurring
letters (a, e, and i):

  aaaaaaa
  aaeaeae
  eaeaeae
  eeeeeee
  eeiiiii
  iiiiiii

It is not clear what use these "words" are.  Granted, "eeiiiii"
probably appeared in some Usenet posting, but if you wait long enough,
"iieeeee" will probably appear also (it just did!).

A colleague of mine tried to use this dictionary to automatically fill in
crossword puzzles; unfortunately, 75% of the words that ended up being
used were not real words, at least as far as I (and the OED) could tell.

I guess what would make this collection more useful would be some
type of labeling for the words, indicating which are real words,
which are misspellings, which were just plunked off of Usenet, etc.

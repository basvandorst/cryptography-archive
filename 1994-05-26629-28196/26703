Just a bit of the pot calling the kettle black.  Why don't you tell everyone
the sources of your information, Mr. Sternlight?  In a debate like this 
concerning trustworthiness of sources, the identity of your sources is far
from irrelevant.  Nor is this your "first time."  I have yet to see a single
attribution in any of your posts, and I've checked about 1.5 meg of back
traffic.

Put up or shut up.

Without taking away anything from the writer's own views, it is worth
pointing out that "natural law" is a specific area of study and discipline,
and has been for hundreds of years. It is not a field in which one may make
up one's own definitions of basic concepts, any more than is physics.

One may introduce new concepts, building on existing work. One may even
show, using the existing methodologies, that some basic concepts might be
wrong. But to ignore them and substitute one's own without analysis and
demonstration is not the way fields of inquiry operate.

In fact, the latter approach is the one which Jeremy Bernstein of the
Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, is a hallmark of the nut cases,
as distinct from the new Einsteins.

Nothing personal--I'm speaking generally.

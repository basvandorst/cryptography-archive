Will it work under OS/2 2.x, especially on a DOS-compatible FAT file system?
The SECDRV TSR loads just fine in an OS/2 DOS box, and attempts to "login"
to the encrypted drive appear to work, correctly verifying the passphrase.
But, alas, the drive appears as garbage.  Apparently OS/2 is bypassing
whatever mechanism SECDRV has for intercepting hard drive interrupts and
system calls.

If SECDEV13 isn't the ticket, is there something that WILL work?

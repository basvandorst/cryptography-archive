No.  I do not know the math behavior of this at all.  I was kinda hoping
somebody better at math than me would render judgment.

There is at least one weak key, the trivial one of 0s.  I suspect there is
only one weak key.  I've played with this in APL and even with ridiculous
keys like all 1s, the results are pretty good over a couple of thousand
output bytes.

My intuition tells me that the longest possible cycle is w^n where n
is the length of seed and w is 2^bitwidth (for me 256, for Peter Boucher's
long, 4+billion).  A group in other words.  But I suspect that that
is very unlikely.  Naively, I think there are any number of cycles.  I am
quite unable to say if there are degenerate cycles based on seed.

I am totally ignorant of the mathematical behavior of these rngs.

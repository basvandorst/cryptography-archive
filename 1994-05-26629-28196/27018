   No, the religious prohibition against murder does not affect the
natural law, it is in addition to it.  On the other hand, the belief
in life after death common to many religions makes a natural law
argument for murder a poor one.  "If you kill me, I'll go tell God,
and he will make your (everlasting) life very unpleasant."

 You got it!  The classical natural law fallacy, but it shows
understanding.  A better natural law question is "Birds can fly, why
can't I?" which lead to manned gliders.

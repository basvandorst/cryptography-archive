Nope. Since last year there has been an MIT Residential Authority and a
TISPEM test authority. Since at least January the formal RSADSI authority
has been in place and signing keys like gang busters. Ripem Mac included the
ability to handle this in its last version, which is of similar vintage, and
the previous version had an earlier version of such certificates.

Nope. Most posts that are signed on, for example, alt.security.pgp, are
signed by lots of different people, and the level of trust is very low
except among insiders of each different poster. For public posting the PGP
"web of trust" is fragmented badly, requires users to store lots of public
keys, and most novice users have no idea who the posters or the signers are.
In contrast, the RSADSI public key for the certification authority is
standard, published, and even built into such software as Ripem Mac.

For public message authentication, it's kinda like who do you trust more:
your bank or someone you never heard of in Europe somewhere?

I agree that for communication between small groups of individuals who know
each other, PGP's web of trust isn't bad. For authenticating general
newsgroup posts it's er, uh, um, patheticly flawed right now, though the
software itself contains the possibility for a partial remedy by setting of
a few standard signers whose keys can be held by all. PGP has a long way to
go to do this, considering the administrative and trust issues involved. It
took PEM quite a while to get any standard heirarchies up; with PGP it will
not only take longer (because so far there's no commercial organization that
can afford the security and the signing hardware) but be more difficult
because of the known paranoia (I don't say unjustified) of many of PGP's
fans, and the high level of ideological resistance to authority and
centralization by that same subgroup of PGP's fans.

This isn't a religious war. These are genuine issues and need to be
addressed seriously.

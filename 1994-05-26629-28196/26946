I've read earlier versions of this paper in conference proceedings.
The paper's main impact is in the learning community which is always
trying to program a computer to learn to predict some pattern. This
shows that there are some finite automata (regular languages and CFLs)
that are as hard to learn as RSA is to break. That means they're 
pretty hard. 

The greater impact to the crypto community is that it also means
that grammar based versions of steganography like Mimic Functions
could be made difficult to break. In reality, the easiest thing is
to first pre-encrypt with RSA and then push it through a Mimic
Function.

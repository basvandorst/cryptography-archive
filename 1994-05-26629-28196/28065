ee@datcon.co.uk is making the tacit assumption that "random number generator"
refers to the usual "linear congruential" approach or "linear feedback shift
register".  In either case, you only need a short segments of the key stream
(I believe less than 2n bits will do, where n is the width of the computer
word or the shift register) to build a system of _linear_ equations with more
equations than unknowns.  The cycle length of the key stream is irrelevant if
the key generator is of this type.

If the key generator is a cryptographic random number generator, knowing a
segment of the key stream gives us a system of _nonlinear_ equations, whose
solution is by no means simple or guaranteed, but is not necessarily impossible.

Even if the key stream consists of truly random bits (a true one-time pad), it
is dangerous to reuse the key stream.  As you observed in your original post,
XOR-ing the two cypher texts produces the XOR of two plain texts.  Since the
redundancy of plain English is much greater than 50%, the XOR of two different
English texts still contains considerable redundancy.  For example, any
constant fields (headers, etc) at the same positions would be zeros.  I suspect
that a skilled analyst could do even more, but I'm just a mathematician, not
a cryptanalyst.

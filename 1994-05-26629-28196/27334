   :Hello!
   :
   :I read that one of the last steps of breaking RSA-129 was to
   :solve a large (ca. 600000x600000) sparse linear equation system.
   :

   The system is over Z/2Z.

   :How was this done?  Is the source code for this step available?

   Gaussian Elimination. 

   Using techniques due to A. Odlyzko, the large sparse matrix was partially
   reduced to one a lot smaller but a lot denser. This final dense matrix
   was then solved on a MasPar in about 40 hours.

   The final matrix was about 160K x 160K if memory serves.


The sparse matrix was 569466 rows by 524338 columns.  This reduced to
a dense matrix of 188614 rows and 188160 columns, for a total of
35489610240 bits (4.13 gigabytes).  That matrix took 45 hours on
Bellcore's 16384-processor MasPar.

I don't think the MasPar Gaussian elimination code is available.

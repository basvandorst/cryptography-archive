Does anyone know of an ftp site which has the sources to telnet?
I am looking for a telnet which encrypts/decrypts. If I can't
find it then I'll build one.

We want to be able to build a system that uses public key
to encrypt the data sent across the wire. So that even if
you can break the password protection, you would still
need to know the secret key of the person to access the
system services.

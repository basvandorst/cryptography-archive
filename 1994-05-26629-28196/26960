The point, which I made and you quoted in your referenced message, and to
which you just posted a non-responsive response was simple. It was asserted
that one reason I got so few responses is that my request that people mail
me with responses would not have been seen by the many who kill filed me.
This reflects an assumption that it was I who requested people to mail me
with responses. It was not.

Since the request that people mail me was made by another, and there was no
reason to believe _anyone_ had kill filed _him_. That assertion is invalid.

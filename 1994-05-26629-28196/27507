Professor David Farber has pointed out that the "Planning a Computer
System" book does, indeed, talk about the Harvest facilities.  It
doesn't use that name, though, which is probably why I didn't remember
it (and didn't find it in the index).

Chaptger 17 describes the "IBM 7950" system, which incorporates a
"Nonarithmetical System Extension" (to the Stretch).  Of course, it
never mentions cryptography, but instead suggests "artificial learning,
character recognition, information retrieval, gaming, and language
translation" as potential applications.

The description is quite detailed; it talks about all the processor
operations, but says nothing about the "IBM 7955 High-speed Tape
System".  The "extension" includes all sorts of table lookups, byte
re-ordering, address generation, and statistical operations.  It
includes an example showing how to convert Roman numbers to Arabic
using a single "SEQUENTIAL TABLE LOOK-UP" instruction.  Curiously, in my
brief glance through that chapter tonight, I saw nothing that looked
like the "canonical NSA instruction": count-one-bits-in-a-register.

A footnote indicates that this was all described in a paper presented at
the 1960 FJCC (though, I'm sure, with no hint of its true purpose).  The
book is copyright 1962.

No. they would not be fast. They would be "parallel". In some sense they would solve
an exponentially large number of problems "at the same time" (You set up a coherent
quantum state which contains all of the computations you want to have done, and then
you make sure that in the output, only those answers that you want constructively
interfere.) So you in some sense replace exponential in time by exponential in
complexity, but all on the same computer rather than on an exponentially large
number of them. So if the assumption that you can maintain coherence over an
exponentially large number of terms is right, you gain. That assumption is however
open to some question.

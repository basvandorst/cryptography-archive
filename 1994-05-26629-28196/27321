Thank You for your responses ...

Don Davis contributed I believe a reasonable approach.

It was originally proposed to use an md5 bitstream and xor it with the
plaintext.

Being md5 should not be exported, I will replace it with a pseudo random
number generator, for casual security, such as linear congruential, I will
bone up on my Knuth and see if there are better.

Supply my clients a decrypting program (not a full crypto system) using keys
discussed over the phone.

Further comments are still welcome (use my email address listed BELOW)

Thanx again

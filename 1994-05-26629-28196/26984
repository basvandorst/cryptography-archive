Depends on whether or not IDEA is a "group" or not.  A group is a cipher
such that:

 e( e( p, k1 ), k2 ) = e( p, k3 )
 
i.e. encrypting with a second key yields a ciphertext equivalent to
encrypting once with some third key, thus there is no security
benefit.

DES is not a group, I don't think anyone has shown IDEA to be one way
or the other.  Cross your fingers & get the FAQ :)  ttul

Yes, you need only eight bytes with known plaintext.  Just search the
whole key space.

The question is, how many computation steps does your program need?
Your message makes it sound as if it is doing better than any published
DES attack, but this is not clear.  The best published attacks follow
the methods described in Biham and Shamir's book "Differential Crypt-
analysis of the DES", but I don't know what the current best numbers are.

The KG-84 is not a government standard.  It is the TSEC/KG-84 crypto, which is
described in the NSA Products & Services catalog as a "general purpose
encryption/decryption device" .  That's about all I can tell you, as much of
it is indeed classified.

An NSA Type 1 product is one that is certified to secure classified U.S.
Government information, as compared to Type 2, which are used to protect
unclassified Government ( or commercial ) information.  In addition, all Type
1 are handled as "Controlled Cryptographic Items", and the equipment assumes
the classification of the key material when keyed.

As for obtaining one ?  Well, NSA endorsed Type-1 products are made by various
contractors ( i.e. Bendix, E-Systems, & others ), but by law are available for
sale only to the U.S. Government and its sponsored contractors.

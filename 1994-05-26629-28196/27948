Well, good for them.  The reasonableness of algorithm patents
has always been a matter of debate.  

The question is, how far will the government go in backing
up this position?  Will it file friend-of-the-court 
briefs in patent infringement lawsuits?  Will it seek
precedent-setting rulings, or perhaps even legislation,
which invalidate various algorithm patents?

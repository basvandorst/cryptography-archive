The following posting intrigued me, because of the clumsy wording in
the post that was quoted.  It sounds a lot like either something out
of a code book (e.g., "Wet birds don't fly at night") or perhaps an
initial letter cipher, etc.  Any takers on trying to break the code?
Or is it just from someone who has an English buzzword lexicon but is
not a native English speaker?

The phrase "read the above several times carefully" got me interested.

How much security do you need?
No matter what algorithm you chose, if your program is to access these
files, it will have to contain the secret key or record it somewhere,
which makes it quite vulernable to reverse-engineering.  This may be
irrelevant to you.  If you just want casual security and aren't worried
about the odd cracker, something you could invent would do I'm sure! :)

From what I understand, anything with a 40 bit key or more is not
exportable, and the only ones that work under 40 bits that I can
think of off hand are RC2 & RC4, but both are patented by RSA and
they haven't even been openly described for public scrutiny, so you
take your chances.

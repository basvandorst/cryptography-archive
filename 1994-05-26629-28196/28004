Uh, not quite. While one could certainly set up a quantum computer in an
initial state of a coherent sum of all possible keys, the probability of
reading the output which corresponded tot he correct key is still the
same as for a classical computer with the key picked picked at random.
To make a quantum computer useful, you have to get the outputs of all of
the calculations to interfere with each other, given the right
"question" to ask of the output, such that the answer has a large
probability of being the right one. That is the tough part, and that is
what has only been accomplished for very very few problems, and general
key finding ain't one of them. Thus a quantum computer could well be
able to solve only some subset of NP problems in polynomial time (or
even some subset of NPComplete). The notion of quantum NP and classical
NP are just very different.

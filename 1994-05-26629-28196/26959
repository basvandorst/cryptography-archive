: about how to find out how many.

Using a word like a "hoax" is consistent with your originally faulty
smear of "most".  Sternlight is not going to weasel out of his shame
by backing off of one term while still asserting the second.

When Sternlight made his charge of "hoax" the smear was unsubstantiated,
it still is unsubstantiated, unless you respect his "Baysian" experimental
method of counting posts to him.

I thin I'll start sending his posts to the .gov address and directly
to Ron Browan, Secretary of Commerce.  With any luck they will
start a "nut" dossier and at all costs avoid considering him as speaking
for anyone other than his demented self.

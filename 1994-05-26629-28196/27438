RSA-129 is 425 bits; rather harder than 384-bit numbers.  We estimate
that 512-bit keys are about 20 times harder than RSA-129, if a more
efficient but available algorithm is used.  No-one knows how much
harder 1024-bit numbers are, but they will be no where near a trillion
times harder than 384-bit keys.  Best estimates suggest that 1024-bit
numbers are about 10^4 to 10^5 times harder than 512-bit numbers.

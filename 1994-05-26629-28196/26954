You generate your own with one of the available public key encryption 
packages.  To start looking, join alt.security.pgp where a "How to get

The whole idea is that it is computationally easy to generate a key 
compared with the effort required to break it.  Don't ask this question 
in alt.security.pgp unless you can face an answer with nested brackets.

The Cray XMP is a pretty old machine.  It was replaced by
the YMP, which itself may no longer be in Cray's current
line.  I would expect that an XMP would be no faster than
a modern desktop workstation (with a similar amount of memory).
Crays do have decent memory subsystems, though, so I could
be wrong for the purposes of the NFS.

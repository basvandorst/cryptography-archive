This is one user who isn't likely to downgrade.  I understand your
predicament, but I don't feel like sending out a whole bunch of new
keys to lots of people on September 1, 1994.  The internet is _global_
you know, and I really don't feel like having 2 PGP programs to keep 
track of, one for the US and one for the rest of the world.

But hey, if you can put this out, maybe the US *can* go metric!  Of course,
it actually proves the US never will.  We'll just keep falling further
and further into incredible stupidity.  This is just too depressing.

Patience, persistence, truth,
Dr. mike

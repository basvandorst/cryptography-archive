What's going on here with this petition?  A petition is public, right?
Why aren't the signatures on line somewhere?  Can't we just choose
30 names randomly from the list by some mutually agreed procedure

verify them?

I saw bits and pieces of the first round of this slanging match,
and now I'm seeing bits and pieces of this round, and it just doesn't

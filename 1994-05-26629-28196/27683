Bushwa! Viacrypt does not have a license to PGP nor to RSAREF. They have a
license to one of the other commercial toolkits. Nothing in PGP2.6 affects
their ability to use that toolkit. By the way, when they took out the
license they didn't know, they assert, what they were going to use it for,
so they have no implied rights with respect to PGP even if such a thing
existed. Next you'll be telling us that Apple can't modify System 7 Pro
because Viacrypt has a license to the RSA patent.

I think that quite unlikely. Viacrypt has a license to the patent, and
nothing more. In particular they may not use RSAREF, since that would be
commercial use, which RSADSI defines as selling software or charging for it.
Viacrypt's use of RSAREF would be in direct violation of the RSADSI license,
which MIT has no power to modify.

A license to the patent gives one no rights at all with respect to
compatibility with anyone else. If one is licensed and wants to program so
that one is compatible, that's Viacrypt's business, but they can't use
RSAREF--they can only program the equivalent themselves. They had to do that
with their PGP--they couldn't use PGP's RSA code but had to reprogram it
from scratch under the terms of their license.

It cannot be licensed for export since the U.S. Government might charge
RSADSI with aiding in ITAR violation. You can't license something for
illegal use and get away with it.

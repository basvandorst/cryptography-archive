After seeing reports from rn of literally dozens of skipped messages in
sci.crypt, I decided to see what was going on.  I haven't bothered to
track down this message "2 above," but I don't recall seeing it.  Perhaps
many people are enjoying the same technology as I am.  The following
lines in a suitable KILL file will cause `rn` to skip any article from
Mr. Sternlight, any article with a subject line about him, and any
article containing his name anywhere it its text.  I suspect relatives
of rn, such as rrn and xrn can understand the same or similar lines.
If this message is not caught and killed by your kill files, consider
the first line below.

It's ironic, but unsurprising that such a computer expert would not
conceive of the possibility that not only articles from him, but articles
about him could be automatically filtered by old, widely used software
like rn.

The best and only effective response to policy experts (sic) such as
Mr. Sternlight is to ignore them.  As long as you play their game of
batting around supriously accurate pronouncements about things they are
incapable of understanding (eg. his claim that a spread of 4 months to
20 years, a factor 60 in estimates answering his big hypothetical question
somehow makes him the expert and everyone else ignorant and confused),
you give them credence and support, and they win.  They are parasites
that survive by tricking you into "entering into dialogue."  After they
have captured enough of your words, they run them through a jargon
production system, announce that they are policy experts, prove it by
quoting your jargonized words, and then demand not only your respect
but fees for their expertise.  If you refuse to play the game, they
starve and you win.

Note that Mr. Sternlight's recently published resume of his computing
qualifications is that of the policy expert (as he titled himself several
months ago, before I got the technology to ignore him)--a little
unimpressive programming in the company of hordes of others in the
distant past, a Ph.D in an unspecified discipline, some grant awards
(from an organization infamous for generosity) described as achievments
but curiously lacking names or titles, and lots of consulting, not as
a programmer but as an expert.

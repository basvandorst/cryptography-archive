I finally must say something about this on going debate of sorts...
I first will admit that I don't read the majority of the news in this
group, I simply read titles that sound interesting and occasionally I
follow some of the more popular subjects.. Anything that has 200 replies
is usually somewhat interesting.  Anyhow I don't unserstand why anybody
really cares what this Sternlight chap says.  In the few exchanges we
have had, he seemed to have an overly idealistic and maybe even naive
view of the government and how the world tends to work.  On the other
hand the majority of people I see making a lot of posts make it sound
like there is some large conspiricy and that the NSA actually gives a
damn about what they say and thus it gives them a reason to use a
1024bit PGP key. (think about it, if you use a key that large, the only
people who could even come close to trying to crack your mail are the
NSA.)  And what are they talking about anyways? ("gee, pgp is pretty
cool, it's almost fun using it...")  I know that some people have
legitimate secrets, business transactions and stuff that they probably
discuss with pgp, but why would the NSA or any crypto-think-tank care
about that stuff?
(I think it's an ego trip to imagine somebody spending 1000s of "Cray
hours" and millions of bucks trying to read your email..)

When you actually look at the scheme of things, Sternlight's sheltered
view is probably the most realistic for the vast majority of us crypto
freaks.  The people who actually need the privacy are quiet about it...

Bottom line, if you're paranoid, killfile his posts.  If you'd like a
little of both sides, then read them with a grain or a bunch of grains
of salt. I for one don't really care about why he thinks what he thinks
or if most of us don't agree with it.

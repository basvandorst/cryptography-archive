GIGO. You did not state your assumptions in terms that experts could
use. You were, however, given enough information to do the analysis
with whatever assumptions that your heart desired. It is time for some
fishing if you want to get more. In fact this is more useful than what
you are asking for, since now you can get some idea of what is possible
with different investments, and you can compare the outcomes with
different assumptions to get a variety of possible scenarios. You can
even do this with as many scenarios as you can dream of.

If you have curiosity and a bit of willingness to work to answer your
own questions those are terms that you can use. How is it arrogant to
point out to you that this is so?

What is "quite a bit" of e-mail? I have quite a bit of e-mail saying
that my post is direct, to the point, accurate, polite, and so on. By
that I mean that in under 12 hours I got 3 pieces of mail from this one
post and all were positive. When you consider that this period was
overnight (so relativly few people were reading news), and you figure
in net delays, this qualifies as quite a bit for one post. How does
yours compare?

Now if there is something in Bob's post that you need clarified before
you are capable of doing your own analysis, then state _politely_ what
point(s) need to be clarified and you will probably get a
clarification. But there is no reason that anyone else is going to
build you a custom-tailored Lambourgini to specs that seem to change
every time we turn around. (Specs that are based on what appears to be
a misplaced image of what the military is capable of.)

PS I was told to ask you what you think about the CPSR petition being a
hoax. I have no idea why so could you give me a complete explanation of
why someone would tell me that? In terms that I can use of course,
which is a subject which you seem to be an expert on.

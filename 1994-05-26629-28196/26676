I'm using a sort of AI program (I dont know what else to call it) to 
predict the input bits of a DES encrypted message using both known and
chosen plaintext attacks. 

The preliminary results indicate that using a known plaintext attack 
will require about 9.8 M Bytes of matched plaintext and cyphertext in
order to achieve a less than 1% error rate.  

This seems like a lot, but maybe not. 

Does anyone know of an such attack that requires fewer matched bytes?

Thanks,

Carl Nicolai

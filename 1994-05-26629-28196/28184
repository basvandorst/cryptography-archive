Quoting David Kahn in "Siezing the Enigma":

"It took a bombe about 15 minutes to run one rotor order and so, with 
shifting rotors from one position to another and dealing with drops 
(halts) some 100 to 150 days would be needed on one bombe to exhaust all 
15360 rotor orders possible on the menu from a single crib"  

They had several buildings full of bombes.

It was a definite weakness.

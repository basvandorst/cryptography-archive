   Simple substitutions are a group.  Since the Enigma (for any
particular rotor settings) is a sequence of simple substitutions, you
can solve for a single "key" that never existed.

   Having said that, if you know the plug board wiring and the first
rotor, the message can be broken up in to 26 character groups and
solved to get the identity and position of the second rotor, then you
can solve 676 character groups for the third rotor, usw.

   Now assume i have a crib with an "interesting" letter pattern like
abcabcdbc or some such.  I can ignore the actual letters and use the
bombe to get any match with the pattern in the encrypted message,
using also the fact that the wiring is reversable, and no letter
translates to itself.

   So, as I said, you need cribs with "interesting" patterns to get
the initial crack.  When you are finished, it is a simple substitution
crack to get the plugboard wiring.  That gives you all the traffic on
that net for the day, even though each message is encrypted with a
different key.  (You can now solve for rotor positions sequentially,
which will take an average of 52 tries by brute force for a four rotor
net.  Oops!)

    Not the only way to strengthen Enigma by making it simpler.
Advancing each rotor by a fixed delta after each letter also helps a
lot.  (You want to use deltas relatively prime to 26 and to each
other: 1,3,5,7 works nicely.)

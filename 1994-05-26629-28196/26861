Heck, there may be hundreds of people that feel YOU are a sad
commentary on them (MIT alumni, RAND employees, etc.) with the way you
represent yourself.

I can't beleive this sort of attack on Bob Silverman.  He has done
some calculations, and has said that he needs YOU to supply some extra
information.

Yet instead of doing this, you call his analysis shoddy, demand better
work (as if he is interested in satisfying your every request in the
first place), and once again blow your own horn.

I mean, this is a classic statement:

> I want such information based on careful analysis, assuming the best known
> technologies of today and the near-future, not on hand waving or approximate
> aggregate assertions. This means considering machine type, power, intensity

I want this, I want that, I want it quick, I want it detailed, and if
you don't hurry up and do it I'll just complain endlessly and insult
you.

Why don't you do the analysis yourself?  

> Arrogance is no substitute for analysis.

If there is anybody arrogant, it is you, Mr. Sternlight.  You
endlessly tout your own qualifications (I've worked on cutting edge
projects in the 1950's - 40 years ago! - and you haven't, I've seen
cutting edge military technology you couldn't possibly dream of, I
know this, I know that, I've done this, I've done that, etc.) and
insult others who actually respond to your questions.

You are as irritating as a loudmouth braggart who enters a room and
loudly demands, over and over, that somebody immediately drop what
they are doing to work on a task you want done.

I would suggest instead of spending hours a day on USENET insulting
other people you take some time out to read a bit of the literature.

Maybe you can figure out what's wrong with my thinking on one item. It
seems to me that you don't need to personally know a signer of a key,
just whether they can be trusted or not. The impression I get is that
you're tying web-of-trust down to 1 level when that isn't needed and
causes problems. If you can be trusted to sign keys with a
high-security key only if the owner will follow your standards for
signing keys, and I receive a new key signed by three people who I
don't know but whose keys you've signed with a high-security key, why
should I not trust those three signatures?

In fact, such a system would be more secure than a single certifying
authority. That authority would be one trusted base signature, and
it's presence would indicate you could almost certainly consider a new
key valid. It's absence, though, would not throw that key into limbo,
since you could use other trusted base signatures to determine whether
to consider it valid. And a fault with the certifying authority would
not automatically invalidate every key signed by them, just those that
did not also have some other trusted base signature in their history.

That also invalidates a point you made about the weakness if one
person in the web becomes untrustworthy. This is only a problem if
there is only a single authority. If there is more than one, and one
becomes untrustworthy, it only affects those keys which are signed
only by that one authority. If the keys were signed by other trusted
persons, those keys remain valid because of the other signatures which
do not depend on that one authority being trustworthy.

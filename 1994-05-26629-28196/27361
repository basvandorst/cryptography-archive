Nick is right that the RSA129 success in no way suggests that RSA is
weak, (only that small key sizes should be avoided) and that we
shouldn't talk about `factoring primes' (it makes us look stupid).
I'd like to make one other correction to an error that frequently
appears in discussions of factoring.  It appeared in the Phil
Zimmerman quote, and again in Nick's post:

The expected run time of the quadratic sieve (or number field sieve)
is not exponential in the length of the product.  It is
super-polynomial, but sub-exponential.

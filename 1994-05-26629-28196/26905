Am I confused or does it sound like none of you talking about
RSA are actually encrypting message bodies with it?  It sounds
like you're encrypting with something else (IDEA?) and then
encrypting the IDEA key with RSA.

Why would you do such a thing?  You then reduce the security
of what you are encrypting to the weakest chain in the link:
the IDEA algorithm.  Why not encrypt with RSA directly?

Maybe I got confused with all of the blathering going on.

Thanks.

steve

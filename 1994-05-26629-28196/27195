Let me re-word my question.  It's easy to give a non-constructive proof
that some number has non-trivial factors (2 ^ 220 = 16 mod 221, hence 221
has non-trivial factors), but difficult to give a constructive proof (find
the non-trivial factors of 221).  In most problems, proving the existence
of some entity is not markedly easier than producing the desired entity.
RSA relies on this not being the case for factoring; why is it so?

As for the remainder of your concerns, the general consensus is that IDEA
is stronger than RSA, inasmuch as it's possible to compare public-key and
symmetric-key encryption schemes at all.  I believe (correct me if I'm
wrong) that RSA is weak against known-plaintext attacks, and hence is
better utilized to encrypt random data (such as a randomly chosen IDEA key
that has been used to encrypt the message), rather than the plaintext
message itself.

Later,
Rujith.

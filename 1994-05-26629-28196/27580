You need the Ph.D thesis of Asad Abidi, "Noise in Relaxation
Oscillators", University of California at Berkeley.  He published
a cut-down version of it in the IEEE Journal of Solid State
Circuits.  Your librarian's computer can find it pretty
handily.

Abidi worked at Bell Labs for a while, back in the days when
conspiracy theorists felt that Bell Labs and IBM Watson
Research Center (the place where DES was invented!) were
ill-disguised secret think tanks doing clandestine research
for the spies and spooks and bad-people of the espionage
world.  Now he's a well respected professor of electrical
engineering at UCLA, and a world leader in integrated
circuit design.

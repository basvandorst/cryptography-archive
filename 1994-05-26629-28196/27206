Often the best way....

Sorry to disappoint you but we Canadians have been testing this for the
last 6 months or so with respect to the transmission of the banned info on
the Karla Homolka case.

The various Freenets that have sprung up around the country have terrible
security with respect to validating users. All you have to do is print
out their membership form, fill in a phoney name, address phone number and
BINGO! One untraceable Freenet account (and no...they don't call back to
verify the phone number). Makes for easy posting of the sensitive
material to the Freenet, which is then bounced through anon.penet.fi

Julf in Finland has gone on record many times as saying that the only
data to be forced from him regarding the anon user would be done via a
court order ..... a FINNISH court order. Which means it is likely the
Finns would give the NSA a "single digit salute" regarding any requests
for a users ID.

Even if such info WAS surrendered, and the account was traced back to the
original Freenet with the phony account, the NSA is likely to find the
"piece of cake" tracing to be pretty lean cuisine, given that the trail
would end there.

Yup. This is major breakthrough stuff, which was, I suggest, not even
suspected in most quarters. Interesting that it is NSA technology, not CIA
technology since one would think the CIA has similar problems of information
retrieval.

It looks like just as the CIA has started to publish what they can and it is
good stuff (we economists have been getting very up-to-date energy and
economic statistics from them via the Library of Congress and NTIS for
years), the NSA may be opening up to at least some extent. The very idea of
an NSA museum would have boggled the mind ten or twenty years ago, and this
bit is a real goody.

Do you know if the NSA is giving this away or selling/licensing it? If the
latter are they telling how its done without the need to pay unless you want
to use it commercially? I'd love to have a quick summary of how they do
this. You could even include it in the next edition if they'd permit it.

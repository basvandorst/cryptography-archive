No.  Having a widely help public key is what makes digital signatures
work.  If you don't have the public key, how can you decrypt the
signature (made with the private key) to see if its valid?  Read the
docs - its in there.

No, its a feature - you need the public key because a signature is a hash
of the message encrypted with the corresponding secret key, and the
public key is what decrypts to verify the hash.  Again, read the docs,
its in there.

But as soon as the software goes to the keyserver then you *do* have the
public key.  That's what keyservers do - they distribute public keys.

What you seem to be describing is a (useful-sounding) feature of RIPEM
to automagically fetch public keys that you need.  PGP does not do
any such fetching, you have to get them yourself, but its not that
difficult with key servers and all.

>PGP groupies, I'm just asking--not attacking PGP.

I'm not attacking you either, as seems to be so popular, but all this
information is described in the helpful documentation that come with
pgp.  The sci.crypt FAQ and the alt.security.pgp FAQ would be good
starts too.  good luck.

Unfortunately, I might be a little bit responsible for this rumor, and
I apologize for that.  David Sternlight made some comment about a 64k
processor connection machine that the DOD bought --- I assumed it was
a recent purchase, and so assumed in a later post that it was a CM-5.
I also assumed that due to the fact that 16k is the reported max for
the number of processors, that they were really counting vector units
(which comes out to exactly 64k for a maxed out CM-5).  The numbers
fit really nicely, but I really didn't consider the economics of it.
That's way beyond the budget that even Reagan-years defense spending
would have allowed for a single machine, and ridiculous in the current
budget cutting days.

Anyway, Barry Margolin pointed this out to me via e-mail, and so the
reported machine must have been a CM-2 class machine.  A 64k processor
CM-2 really isn't such a big deal...  (yes, it's a big, expensive
computer, but I would bet that a 128 node CM-5 would out-run it in a
speed test.

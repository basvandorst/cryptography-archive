   Is there any chance of putting an end to this pointless flamewar?  It's
basically shutting down all technical discussion of crypto here.  I find
that it's much more productive for me to sit around and reread crypto
articles and books than to bother reading sci.crypt--even though I've read
the articles/books several times before, and they're generally several years
old.
 
   I know this is an unmoderated newsgroup, but can we *please* try to keep
discussions here relevant to crypto in some way?  Technical discussions of
crypto-related topics, sincere questions about these topics, maybe even
crypto-product announcements, posting homebrew algorithms to see what other
people say about them, all belong here.  Personal attacks and flames would
probably be better in e-mail.
 
   If you feel you have to respond to a flame with a flame in the newsgroup,
can you please at least put something in your subject lines to indicate that
your post is a flame or not a technical post?  The RSA-129 subject line
carried some really interesting posts about how well the best-known factoring
algorithms scale to massively parallel machines, how increases in MIPS
lead to increases in safe RSA modulus sizes, etc.  It also included an
unfortunate number of fluff-posts, including a couple from me.  We've
effectively killed technical discussion here.  I haven't seen a single post
commenting on Ken Shiriff's description of his attack on REDOC-III--did
anyone besides me read it all the way through?  (I haven't been able to find
any flaws in it, has anyone else?)  Is there any way to keep an unmoderated
group from being swamped in off-topic discussions?

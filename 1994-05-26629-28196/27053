The author who asked that people mail me was very polite and sincere, and
asked that people discuss their views with me. He explicitly asked that
people do not mail bomb me.

As a result, except for one or two jerks, all the mail I got was thoughtful
and serious, and I responded in kind.

Those people who did mail me would be welcome in my living room anytime, in
contrast to some of the hoodlum children here.

(No, I'm not talking about you but others who, by their chosen behavior
know perfectly well who they are.)

I'm very new to cryptography and this was the first book I picked up. I
think it's excellent because it's not too mathematical and spends a lot
of time developing protocols. I think the approach is perfect for a 
manager like me who would like to know about the field but might not
have the mathematical talent to delve too deep into the subject.

I bought my copy from the small computer book club here in the US and
it did not come with a disk.

YES! I suppose if don't mind retyping code, it's no problem. The last
1/5 of the book is code examples... I bought it for the text.

I don't know if this matters, but my ISBN has a -2 on the end. Maybe
that's the version that doesn't have the disk?

I think this is the gist of the problem. Some of us do not believe that
security and authenticity can be granted be a higher authority. I (and I
suspect many others) trust the judgement of people I trust more than
I do any company or government, no matter what hardware they have to
prevent unauthorized use.

People are the weakest link in every security system. PGP lets me choose
which people I trust, and which I don't. The RSADSI Certification
Authority ammounts to: "I'm bigger than you are. Trust me because I
tell you I'm trustworthy."

The issue is not hardware, but choice. With PGP I can choose whom to trust.
RSADSI says: "you must trust me."

No, it's because they know the one or two people involved, and select them
based on trust.

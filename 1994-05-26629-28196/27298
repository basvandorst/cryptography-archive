Apart from the self-evident fact that they -- or anyone else running a
net archive -- could collect such eaddresses, why do you think that MIT
is doing so?  With Kerberos, they explicitly did *not* keep track of
who downloaded the full distribution, as opposed to the DES-free ``bones''
version, because a log that does not exist cannot be subpoenaed.

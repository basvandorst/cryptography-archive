Save your $25.  I read the book.  The best encryption technique discussed 
in the book uses some floating point arithmetic in a random number 
generator -- and the answers are different if you have a different math 
coprocessor in your computer.  Of course, you could crack the contest 
challenge text and get the money (if you are first), but you would have 
to (1) reverse engineer the object code to find out how the author 
processed the key, then (2) crack the key by brute force (its only about 
40 bits of effective key space).  Then read the fine print, and find out 
that the $1000 has dwindled to a lesser amount by now...

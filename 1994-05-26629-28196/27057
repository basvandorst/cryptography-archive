Vernon Schryvers message brought this home.  Kill files are not bogus.
There are people around who kill messages not only based on the author
but also on some particular author, even if they are only mentioned in
the article.  There is also a famous sci.math example.  So, perhaps
David, it would be better if you put in your killfile a line that
would kill all articles where you were mentioned.

The 40-bit "RSA" cipher in question is RC2 and/or RC4, conventional
symmetric ciphers designed by Ron Rivest of RSA Data Security.
Rumor has it that "RC" stands for "Ron's Code".

RC2 and RC4 are designed to have a variable-length key and to
be very secure when long keys are used.  They are also pretty
fast even when implemented in software.
I believe that Microsoft Access uses RC2 or RC4 for database encryption,
from vague remarks in the Microsoft developer's documentation.

Descriptions of these algorithms are not available, though I 
believe you can license the source code if you've enough $.

But noone is really answering my question.  The BBS paper (if I remember
correctly) bases all their security on the assumption that finding
discrete logs is hard.  Rabin's paper shows that his scheme is as hard
as factoring, so assumes that factoring is hard (the equivalence between
finding square roots mod N and factoring is well known --- it's the basis
for most modern factoring algorithms, in fact).  I'm asking what basis
do people have to assume these things are hard, other than people's
failure to find efficient algorithms for them?  In other words, is
there any *real* lower bounds work out there.

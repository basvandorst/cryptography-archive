1. The fact that  you 2 guys have agreed to argue says you have some
  minimal trust in the net.  This makes sanse since the cost of spoofing 
  the argument is greater than the value of the argument.  (Not trying to
  offend, here...)

2. Merging together our society's pre-existing authentication/certification
  systems into on-line crypto should be sufficient for buying and selling
  over the net, hiring, and passing around Trade Secrets with remote
  employees and contractors.  If you want to start a criminal conspiracy
  with a complete stranger over the net go ahead;  All criminal conspiracies
  should start that way. (We'd be safer).

3. The outline of a certification scheme for non-criminals can be seen from
  EXISTING on-line business transactions that are operating now for Internet
  Service Providers (like PSI, Netcom, Delphi...) and with on-line Bookstores
  like Powells in Portland.  You first communicate via Net or even phone,
  exchanging basic data like phone number, name and address.  At some point
  the Retailer mails you something to fill out and sign.  You do that and mail
  it back.  If you had your ID and/or Public Key on the form, and had the
  signature Notarized...  You each could be pretty darn sure of the
  person at the other end.  

  I suppose you could say the Notary Public is part of a Centralized Authority,
  but it's really more like a Web-of-trust situation.  Or "WEBS of trust...".

  Don't forget to verify phone numbers using the phone book.  

QUESTION:  If we generate our public keys properly, shouldn't we gain some
    security if we put BOTH our public key and email address onto our
    business cards ?

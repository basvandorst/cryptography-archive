That is anybodies guess, the first approximation is "how much harder it is".

Slower machines, yes.  Slower memory also?  How fast is custom state-of-the-
art 8-32 MB memory?  And, if I remember right, the final matrix in the
current effort was some 2 GB.  Going to larger numbers will yield larger
matrices.  How many machines do have that amount of memory?

I do not think the question cannot be answered to your satisfaction.  You
have to do with the "so much harder".  It is difficult to estimate the
effects of processor speed, memory speed and memory size.  The problem
scales with none of those directly.

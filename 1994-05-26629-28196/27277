Nope. The NSA has repeatedly defended before Congress its right to
monitor, for example, overseas cables and telephone calls between
Americans and foreign nationals.
 
Somewhere between the "The First Amendment doesn't apply in Absurdistan"
and the Euroweenie "DoD/IP" arguments, people seem to keep forgetting
that the Usenet is by nature an international link -- it's _all_ 
fair game!

Hmm. Bamford mentions that when FBI runs across an encrypted numbers
game or gambling record, it sends it to the NSA, where mathematicians
break it over lunch. It's hard to imagine a bunch of gun-toting accountants
and lawyers dirtying their hands on computers that don't have fingerprints
stored on them somewhere.

I love it. Just on the off chance that all governmental agents are
complete cyber-morons: (click) ATTENTION K-MART SHOPPERS! I AM USING
SUPPOSEDLY STRONG CRYPTO! NYAH NYAH NYAH. Too bad it's politically
incorrect to tote your illegally-modified Mini-14 down to the local
veteran's memorial and burn a clip into the air in the name of freedom.

No David, except in your out of touch mind, the issue of the CPSR's 
behavior regarding their "petition" was resolved (in their favor) months 
ago. The issue is now entirely your behavior. You have been obfuscatory, 
bullheaded, willfully blind, misleading and generally ill-behaved on not 
only this but other issues.

When presented with overwhelming evidence against your positions you 
drag large red herrings, launch ad hominem attacks while failing to 
address issues, deny you ever made statements, and generally act the boor.

: It's a very old tactic but it no longer works. Thomas has used it several
: times too often.

Your (David's) attempt to switch topics is duely noted and rejected.

Lets talk about why you find it needful to misrepresent and distort facts 
to support your untenable positions.

Compare public key RSA to RSA where both keys are kept secret.  How many
orders of magnitude more secure would you figure the latter is?  The weakness
of public key versus private key is a relative thing; if public key is secure
then isn't it more secure to keep secret the "public key"?

A suggestion:
	Why not attach the subject "FLAME" when you insult someone and "POLITICAL"
when you talk politics.  That way those who read this newsgroup to read about
cryptography can filter out the noise.

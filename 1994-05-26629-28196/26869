Ok, ok, ok....  enough already.  Here is a simplified analysis with a few
disclaimers.   It is only meant to give "ballpark" figures.  I am using
the figures given by Bob Silverman for factoring difficulty, and some
readily available information on machine speeds.

Discaimer 1:  I will assume everything scales up nicely that needs to
scale up.  In particular, things get *very*large* for 1024 bit keys, but
I'm going to assume that there is plenty of memory to handle this.  If
anything, this gives an optimistic view of things.

Disclaimer 2:  This is using MIPS ratings for processors and assuming that
it means something.  As Silverman has pointed out, memory bandwidth becomes
very important, and memory speeds are not increasing like CPU speeds are.
As someone else pointed out, other factors in the architecture of machines
affects how many "MIPS-years" factoring would take on that machine.  Still,
given disclaimer 1, and the accuracy of Silverman's figures, I would bet these
estimates are within a factor of, say, 4 of being correct.

Now here's the beef.  If you're going to base this on MIPS figures, about
the cheapest you can "buy MIPS" these days is in a DEC Alpha.  Since no
fine-grained parallelism or fast communication is required, lets assume that
your $30 million is spent buying as many diskless, monitorless DEC 3000/300X's
with 32 Meg that you can get.  That will buy you about 3750 machines.  
Incidentally, at least for this problem, this is *far* more cost-efficient 
than the legendary "massively parallel machine" you keep talking about.  Total
MIPS power of these machines:  3750*160 = 600000 MIPS (wow!).

Now RSA-129 took approximately 5000 MIPS-years to do.  Subject to the
disclaimers above, this would take about a little over 3 days of full-time
computing to do (but, of course, I doubt that the final reduction scales
so nicely on a network of such machines --- however, because of disclaimer 1 
I will assume optimistically that it does).

Fine.  3 days.  Pretty fast, right?  Sure --- if you want to put $30 million
worth of computer equipment on the task full time for 3 days.  What about
bigger keys?

512 bits:  Silverman says this is approximately 25 times more difficult.
Therefore, this would take 75 days, or approximately 2.5 months of
full-time computation on your $30 million machine.

1024 bits:  Again from Silverman's post, he estimates (as accurately
as can be done) that this is 10^4 to 10^5 times as expensive as 512 bit
keys.  Therefore, this would take at least 750,000 days, or over 2000 *YEARS*
of full-time computation on this machine.

What about special purpose hardware?  I really have no idea.  If you assume
1000 time speed improvement for the same money (a pretty big assumption),
then your 512 bit key might fall pretty quickly, but the 1024 bit key is
still pretty safe.

Now, we could discuss this rationally if you would like, or everybody could
be true to form (you could call me "arrogant", and Bob Silverman can call
me an "ignorant moron" or something similar... :-) ).

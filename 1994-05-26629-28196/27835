A while ago, I asked for reading-list suggestions.  I got one
response -- a suggestion for Gus Simmons' book "Contemporary
Cryptology".

I should have waited!  FAQ #10 has great references.  I also just got
& read Bruce Schneier's extremely wonderful book "Applied
Cryptography" which has -- hold on to your hat -- 908 references! 
Zowie!

I will never want for reading material again.

Hi,

I am currently working on building a security API for a desktop 
videoconferencing system. The target platform is a 486DX66. As there is a
need to protect the contents of the video from intruders and tapping, I need
to scramble or encrypt the video. Which is more feasible? Could anyone help
me by suggesting a FTP site from which I can get a free copy of scrambling
software to try. Better still if source is available.

Thanks and Rgds.

Kok Kee

I stand corrected; I had the idea that ViaCrypt negotiated a special
license to use RSAREF commercially.

Could ViaCrypt now negotiate a separate license with RSADSI to allow it to
use RSAREF commercially and another license from MIT to use their portions
of PGP 2.6 commercially?  Or is there something in the current RSAREF
license that prevents RSADSI from granting more than one type of license
on RSAREF.

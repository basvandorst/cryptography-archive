  I'm looking for a list of the hundred most frequently used words in
the English (actually American if possible) language.  If anyone has
such a list lying around, I'd appreciate it if they could mail it to
me.  

  I've checked the FAQs for references to online frequency lists
with no success.  (The offline version I have doesn't distinguish
between different tenses of the same word (have == has == had)).
This seems like a FAQ, but maybe it's only useful for trivial-to-crack
schemes (which is what I'm working on) so nobody cares... :-)

Thanks,
  --Greg

I assume that you are familar with the saying "Give someone a fish and
they eat for a day. Give them a fishing pole and they eat for a
lifetime." Bob is a knowledgable person who makes a habit of giving
people extremely fine fishing poles. You obviously have mistaken yours
for a fish and are therefore somewhat distressed. That is not Bob's
fault, and I suggest that you take his advice and learn to use the
perfectly good pole that you have been given...

With that pole you can get a good sense for what, with given
assumptions, people (experts or not) can know about the answers to your
questions. You can also get a sense for what they cannot know.
Personally I would say that your pole is perfectly good and needs no
fixing. You do, however, have to use it yourself to get a good dinner.
So stop complaining. (And if you do not like the fish that it catches,
well that is your problem and it has nothing to do with the quality of
this particular pole which is, for the purpose, about the best
available.)

Happy fishing.

Would you care to specify which of the many groups in the "Newsgroups:" line
you're referring to here?

I had to read that sentence about 5 times before it began to make sense,
and I'm still not sure I've understood it, as what you are suggesting seems
quite bizarre. I don't believe I've ever previously met anyone who asks a
question & when he is told how to find the answer, responds indignantly
with "Give me the damn answer! Did I give you permission to treat me as one
of your students?"

You've lost me again, sorry.  Are you referring to your own position, or to
mine?  If the latter, I think you need to learn how to read and understand
email addresses.

Evidently, you need to take a look in a mirror.

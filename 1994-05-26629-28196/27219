I've read that factoring N to aquire p and q to get d. Why is it not a good idea to 
multiply all known primes together into a table, and check if N is in it, and then 
look up p and q? Seems as though It would take ther same amount of time and each
time you worked the problem it would get easyer for more searches as your database grew.

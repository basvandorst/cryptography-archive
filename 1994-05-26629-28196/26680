I wish people would stop shooting their mouths off about this when they don't
know what they are talking about.

Why don't you try READING about the algorithms involved before making
such pronouncements.

The run time for QS depends only on the size of the number being factored
andalso in how rich that number is in small quadratic residues (the latter
makes a difference of up to a factor of about 2 in run time). The worst
case for this algorithm is the same as the average case. You sieve
until you collect a sufficient number of relations. The rate at which you
produce relations depends on the size of the number and the size of the chosen
factor base. I knew (and had publically stated) 4 years ago that RSA-129
would take 5000 MIPS-years to do.

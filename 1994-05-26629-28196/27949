Jeff Schiller is a long-time network person.  Among other things, he's
the new security area director for the IESG, which means that he's in
charge of standardizing security protocols for the Internet.  He runs
some large portion of the telecommunications system at MIT, though his
exact title escapes me at the moment.  He was one of the folks behind
Kerberos.

In short, his pedigree in such things is impeccable, and he'd have a
*lot* to lose by sabotaging the code.

I worked on a 1260 node machine (transputers not CM). MTBF about 7 days -
the chips were out of spec and very flakey. This was back in 1988. The problem
is very easy to solve, just take a checkpoint every so often.

Looking at some of the hardware on the market today 100Spec is quite easy to
come across. So the 1000Spec used (recon 5 Mips to the spec for a RISC...)
would only be 5 processors. Could probably get you change out of $20,000.

The question of memory per process was raised. Most parallel problems have
a balance between memory cost per process item and intercommunication time.

It would be safe to assume the NSA are using a machine of at least the power
to 1024 100Spec processors. That would give them about the power to crack
a 512 bit key in a few months. Depending on what you set for the other
imponderables such as algorithmic advantage, cyclic reuse of previous
crypt attempts etc an extra three orders of magnitude in effective processing
power should be scored which would put them in the 600 bit range.

Interesting problem...

Classified document list deleted.

A number of those documents related to EMP proofing.  I remember in the
early 80's an AT&T book (not classified) discussing hard-line
communications and EMP proofing.  Unfortunately at the time the book was
listed in there catalog at $90.  Does anyone know the title/availability of
this book.

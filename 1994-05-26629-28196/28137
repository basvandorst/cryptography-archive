Jim Dow
Excalibur Technologies  ... used to be
2300 Buena Vista SE
Albuquerque, NM 87106
(505) 764-0081

We worked on his SAVVY project in early eighties, which with negligible
code, trivial algorithms, and *no* attempt to analyze syntax was capable
of providing usable multilingual text query capabilities.  Jim's stuff
is practical; he is himself dyslexic, which he said was one of his main
motivations.

See PC magazine 16 Oct 1990 page 81.

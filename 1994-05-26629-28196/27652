ViaCrypt PGP was never blessed by RSADSI, nor was any program calling itself
PGP until (apprently) 2.6. In any case it does not use RSAREF. There is no
reason RSADSI should support it. If there is a compatibility problem between
Viacrypt and something else, it's Viacrypt's problem to fix it, not the
something else.

Note the follow-up line.

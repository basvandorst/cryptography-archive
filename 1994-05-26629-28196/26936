It is not uncommon to encrypt the body of messages with other
than RSA, using RSA only to encrypt the key for the message
body. PGP uses IDEA for the body, RIPEM uses DES (or TDES?)
for the body. This is for performance reasons - ciphers
such as IDEA and DES/TDES are enormously faster than RSA.

It is clear that if the IDEA/DES/TDES vs RSA are not
equally strong, then one must be weaker than the other, and
one must therefore be the 'weakest link'.  It is not
clear, however, that this weak link is IDEA. Even if
I grant the hypothesis that IDEA is theoretically weaker
it does not follow that this has any practical bearing -
if it takes, X-years to break RSA, and say X-1 years to
break IDEA, then IDEA is of course 'weaker', but if X
is, say 1000, or 100 this 'weakness has no practical
significance.

What is your basis for asserting IDEA as the weakest
link, and what is the practical consequence of such
weakness.

(BTW, though I don't know you are one such, many
people are confused regarding the significance of
different key lengths between RSA and ciphers such
as IDEA, DES, etc., beleiving that the shorter keys
of IDEA etc. implies a weaker cipher. Key lengths
do not compare between RSA and the others; they are
quite different animals entirely - a 128 bit IDEA key
is not known to be currently crackable (standard
caveat about 'within reasonable time/money'), whereas
a 128 bit RSA key could be cracked in an hour
with any garden-variety PC.)

Oh, the NSA knows this... they just haven't told the dolts in Congress :)

Just drop ship your non-US systems out of Switzerland.  We researched this 
a number of years ago and the only country you needed to add to the
loop was Switzerland... no export controls... no repatriation of profits
problems... good access to the main non-US market, Europe... lots of folks
who know crypto.  I assume your export business is already done via a
FISC (Foreign International Sales Corporation...read legal tax dodge)...
just locate it in Switzerland.

Like the US, damn few countries have import controls on crypto.  
Those that might would require an additional business partner.  (That or
just say 'f**k em'.  Some piddly ass markets just are not worth too much
trouble :)

As John Grimes, whom you just responded to, asserts that the request was made
by himself (did you read that?) the quoted article lacks sense.

But apparently something confusing is going on.  There appear to have been
two requests.
1.  By John Grimes to you a request to publish a mail address so that people
    could send their signature by snail mail for you to verify.
2.  By somebody (Graham Toal is probably able to say who, although you will
    not see it if he does) a request for lurkers to send e-mail to you
    explaining why they do lurk only.
So far I have *not* seen a request from anybody to send you e-mail to explain
why they e-signed the petition.  Please tell us who made that request.

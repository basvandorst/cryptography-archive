for the DOS version:

1.  i tried to run pgp25 on the included file "keys.asc" and it didn't 
know what to do with it.  neither did pgp23a.  is keys.asc bad?

2.  i ran the -kc option on my pubring and it cleaned up the garbage but 
when i tell it to update my trust parameter they don't stay updated.  ie, 
when i run the -kc option again it asks me if i want to update (i just did!!)

am i an idiot, or is something amuck?

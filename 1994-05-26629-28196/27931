Hello:

A few days ago I posted this request:

> I'm attempting to devise a cipher which uses cryptographically secure
> hash functions (key-dependant) as building blocks. I wonder if anyone
> can point me to some reference material on the design, security, and
> cryptanalytic results of ciphers based on hash functions such as MDC
> &tc. (I have Applied Cryptography and have scrutinized it so closely
> that the type has almost been worn off the pages).

Unluckily, my current service provider has disintigrated, and I can only
get email from the net. Could those who have replied to this post please
email copies of their replies to me? I'm posting this via a remailer, so
please note the Compu$erve address below. Thank-you.

Regards,
Reginald !:-)

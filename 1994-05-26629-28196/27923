No, the licensor offers the license, the licensee accepts the license
together with any restrictions STATED IN THE LICENSE. That's it. There
is a meeting of minds. A meeting of minds does not demand being able to
read the others mind, only that you accept the explicite statement of
what is in the other's license. And the judge then has to assume that
that license was carefully thought out and as unambiguously expressed as
desired by the licensor. The licensor cannot change the terms after the
offer has been accepted, nor can he say that in addition to the license
other definitions etc unstated in the license also apply. If he had
wanted them to apply they should have been in the license (especially
since he wrote it) 
(Hey why are you eating that chocolate bar. Didn't you know that I sold it to you
only under the condition that you not eat it? I didn;t say that? Well I
thought it and that good enough.:-)

For an encryption program, surely making the encrytion harder to break
is a performance improvement, since the only thing the program is
supposed to perform is to create a hard to break encryption.
Would a judge buy the arguement that performance improvement could
reasonably be interpreted only to mean a speedup? Who knows, judges have
been reputed to buy many arguments which others at times find strange,
but I think that a reasonable definition of performance improvement for
an encryption program would include increased security of encryption.
But then my thoughts are well known to have little legal weight.

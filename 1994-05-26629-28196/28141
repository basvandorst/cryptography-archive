I think the real trouble with Clipper is that is assumed that the
keys will be safe, but the keys would be a very valuable commodity.
i.e. If the DEA were to use clipper for communications you
can bet that the Cali Cartel,  Medelin Cartel, and Khun Sa
have enough money to bribe somebody to get that key. You can
also bet that plenty of other people would be well enough served
by such a key to make an effort to steal it.

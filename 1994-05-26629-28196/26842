   If I hear this question or claim one more time I will throw up.

Now that might be interesting to watch 8-)

   I wish those of you who have never worked with a sieving algorithm would
   stop speculating about what might be done. You don't know what you are
   talking about.

   Increases in machine speed do NOT translate into increases in the speed 
   of sieving algorithms. The reason for this should be clear to anyone who
   knows anything about computer architecture.

   Sieving algorithms strongly depends upon the speed with which you can
   pull data from the cache and through the cache and put it back.

   I have tried many times (say) to benchmark machines A and B. B is (say)
   ten times as fast as A. It has 10 times the Specmarks, 10 times the MIPS.
   But it does not run sieve algorithms anywhere close to 10 times as fast.
   These algorithms depend strongly on memory cycle times and on cache size.

I have been trying to wean people off the use of mips-year as a
measure of resources.  Here are some real data points from the RSA-129
project.

A notional 3 GIPS 16k MasPar MP1 would have required ~7000 mips years.
A notional 15 MIPS DEC 5000/25 would have required 5960 mips years.
A notional 25 MIPS Sparc-2 would have required 4200 mips years.
A notional 20 MIPS 486DX33 would have required 4200 mips years.
A notional 1.5 MIPS Sun 3/50 would have required 1500 mips years.

No, that last line is not in error.  A Sun 3/50, with supposedly only
one tenth the power of my DEC 5000/25, generated relations at 40% of
the speed.  Neither is the first line wrong.  The MasPar does not have
enough memory per processing element to run ppmpqs very well.

Bob is quite correct when he states that memory efficiency is more
important than raw cpu speed for modern seiving algorithms.

   Until memory access times start coming down dramatically (i.e. to perhaps
   10nsec instead of 60 or 80nsec) for dynamic ram, and until workstations
   have much larger caches with faster static ram, increases in processor
   speed won't matter very much. Sieve algorithms wind up running at the
   speed of MEMORY and not at the speed of the PROCESSOR.

One other thing: modern algorithms working on big numbers take a *lot*
of RAM.  Our RSA-129 code ran, just, on 8M machines but they paged
themselves into oblivion once anything else wanted to run.  The real
minimum size is around 12M and 16M was much nicer.  If we could have
run on 4M machines, we could probably have made use of ten times the
number of computers.  There are a *lot* of 4 and 8 megabyte PCs out
there.

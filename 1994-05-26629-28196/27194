I bet along with his pro-gov't policy on clipper, he's one of those that
think modern firearms 'have no place in society', either, but suddenly,
magically, become all goodness, apple pie, and motherhod when in the
hands of a BATF goon, FBI enforcer, or midnite kick-yer-door-in team,
all the better to stitch up the (presumably) unarmed civilian after
knocking on the door with an MP5 burst.  Again, because a government
monopoly on force, like secure and private communications, enhances
government power, and the non-government people having such decreases
it - an anathema to the 'New World Order' and other futurist types.
Their world falls apart when the people are not forced to be TOTALLY
dependent on the ever-loving STATE.

Followups reset more appropriately.

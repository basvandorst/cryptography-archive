Is there an accepted standard basic measure of the "security" of a 
code?  For example, the probability of being cracked within xx hours 
with a yy-MHz machine, or codecracker application zz?

We've been tasked to evaluate the "security" of a system.  I haven't 
the foggiest where to start.  Surely there is some standard measure?

Oh, and OBTW, any pointers for the FAQ for this group?  :-)

Email if yo prefer...

Thanks in advance,

Could some kind soul point me in the right direction to get a way
to recover (read: get acess) to a amipro 3.0 file where the password
was lost?

I looked in a BBS that a previous reponse said it may have the wordperfect one. No luck.

If this is the wrong group, please accept my apologies.

Any hints, including whether this can or can't be done are appreciated?

Thanks for your time,

Actually, I hope that the NSA will do some "meddling" in a positive
way. They know plenty of stuff about the science of cryptology and it
would be nice to learn it from the masters. Naturally, they don't want
to talk, but, oh, if they only would... 

I think there is a good argument for encouraging plenty of public
cryptographers who are knowledgable and well-trained. Unfortunately,
many programmers try to come up with their own "cool" cryptosystem and
just re-invent the wheel. Then we're stuck with Word Perfect's
encryption system which some people think is really secure and a few
people know is as leaky as a sieve. This is not a healthy situation. 

In fact, when it comes down to it-- the NSA meddled in the design of
DES and helped make it secure. Word Perfect came up with a "clever"
little algorithm and didn't make anything secure. Which would you
rather have?

(P.S. And isn't there something ironic about encouraging the NSA to be
"free and open" about the science for keeping secrets? I'm just
asking.)

The real answer is that ``initialization vector'' is a horribly vague
phrase. Most commonly it refers to what I call a ``time-key'' in the
snuffle documentation: something derived from not-too-secret information
like the date, a process id, etc. The crucial feature of a time-key is
that it's different for every message. If it's prefixed to the actual
message then it throws a wrench into known-plaintext and
chosen-plaintext attacks (like the Biham-Shamir attacks). Hiding a
time-key doesn't gain much.

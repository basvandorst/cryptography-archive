If it voilates basic assumptions behind classic signature systems, then it
probably doesn't work! Nobody would want to patent it. We'll see:

Here's the real problem with the scheme. If a machine posting onto the
internet sends its news source to one place (we'll assume we're
talking about USENET for the time being). Then the v_i and any other
messages may be withheld for an arbitrary amount of time, until the
required 'v_i' has gone past, at which point a 'bad guy' can start
forging messages. I may need to change the dates in the messages
before I pass them on... but that is fairly straight forward.

In general public key encryption techniques work better, they don't
have these timing requirements, and people arriving on the scene
'late' can still check that they were posted by the same source...
Furthermore, I can do things like writing my public key on my business
card, and hand it round to people who really need to know who I am,
something I don't think you can do with the 'v_i' scheme...

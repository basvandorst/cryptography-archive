The paper did not directly prove an answer either way. The paper provided 
statistical evidence that DES is not is group. 

The idea is that if DES is a group, multiple encryption of the plaintext X 
is equivalent to the single encryption of X, and DES will map X to at most 
2^{56} strings. On the other hand, if this equivalance is not true then X 
is expected to be mapped to all 2^{64} strings.

Let DES(X) be the set of all ciphertexts that X can be mapped to under 
multiple encipherment. If |DES(X)|, the size of the set, is 2^{64} then
DES is not a group. Since computing DES(X) is difficult, cycling tests were 
designed to give some information about the size of DES(X). If values X_1, 
X_2, ..., X_k are drawn from DES(X) at random then a repeat X_i = X_{i+j} is 
expected after approximately k = sqrt(|DES(X)|) selections.

Then if DES is a group a repeat is expected after approximately 2^{28} 
selections.  The tests of the paper indicated that no cycle was found until 
approximately 2^{33} selections from DES(X), which gives strong evidence that 
DES is not a group.

The paper is long and has many details. In fact the paper is essentially
Sherman's PhD thesis which actually earned him two PhDs - one in CS and one
in engineering - seemingly, one for designing the tests and one for building 
the hardware to implement the tests.

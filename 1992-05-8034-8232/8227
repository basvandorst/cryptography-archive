	Yes. I have one on my desk. (a smartcard)  And I have a pure software

	Take a look at "Authmgr - an authentication service for datakit"
David Cohrs, Computer Sciences Dept, Univ. of Wisconsin.

	Not sure where you can find a copy other than where I got mine,
in the "Unix research system papers, vol 2" (ISBN:0-03-047529-5)

Isn't the use of the time() function at install time (via an installation
script) a good solution for this. time() could be used to generate a seed for
the pseudorandom generator. The install time of the product is generally not
known outside.

Or is the creation of a random seed not enough to make the pseudorandom numbers
safe?

Btw. What about the work being done in New Zealand and The Netherlands? Is this
the only port of PGP. I understand that a Unix port would be available around
june 92.

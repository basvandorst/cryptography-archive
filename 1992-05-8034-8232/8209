I have been asked to review Lotus Notes as a "groupware" possibility
for the bank I work for. However, the documentation to hand is woe-
fully inadequate. If anyone has had experience with this product, or
can point me to reviews of it, I would appreciate it.

BTW, we Aussies are being offered the "export" version approved by
all appropriate USA TLA's. If past experience is anything to go by, we
may have to ask the vendor to remove any encryption so we can put 
something suitable in its place.

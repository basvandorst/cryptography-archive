Summary: An Anti Tampering security Program
Lines: 12

I have written ATP (Anti Tampering Program), a program that system 
administators and `paranoia-users' will find useful.

It is a program to make file tampering and nasty-hacking uneffective. 
ATP snapshots the critical files and you can examine them later, to
discover if SOMETHING has changed. There are many options and
the program is quite flexible. I cannot explain it here. Just get a copy
at ftp site ghost.dsi.unimi.it, under the pub/crypt directory.

Feel free to send me your remarks.

Ciao,   David

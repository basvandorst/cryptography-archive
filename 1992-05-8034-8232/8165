By all means, do a transposition.

In fact, I think the world needs a good, simple transposition program --
one which takes all input (up to 8192 bytes, for example) and transposes
bytes based on a PRNG initialized from a password, so that the second block
has a different transposition from the first block.  The password
could even be augmented by the sum of the bytes in the first block -- to
get a per-message salt.

Care to write one?

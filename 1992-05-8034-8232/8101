I've been reading the PEM ("Privacy Enhanced Mail") documents.
PEM encrypts a message with DES in CBC mode, using a randomly selected
DES key and a random initialization vector.  (PEM also has other modes
of operation.)  The DES key is then RSA-encrypted using the public
key of the recipient.

The RSA-encrypted DES key, and the initialization vector, are put into
headers at the front of the message so that it can be decrypted.  The
initialization vector is in cleartext form.

Does exposing the IV weaken the encryption?  It seems to me that
the IV could have been packed into the RSA packet along with the
DES key and RSA-encrypted in one step.  Would doing this add any
security, or doesn't it matter that the IV is exposed?

In other words, if you had to break a DES in CBC with a random IV,
would it help you to know the IV?

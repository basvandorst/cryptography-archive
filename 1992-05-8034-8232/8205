I finally found some more time to work on zipcrack, and I've improved 
the program considerably since the initial release a month or two ago.  
It now checks over 100,000 (!) passwords per second on my 33mhz 80386, 
20-25 times faster than before.  It also has a decent user interface and 
no longer marks occasional incorrect passwords as valid. 

If anyone wants, I'll post the program's docs to sci.crypt.  The file 
discusses the new zipcrack as well as some (to my knowledge) previously 
undocumented problems with PKZIP encryption.

To get a uuencoded copy of zipcrack (about 23K, for MSDOS 80386 and 
above only), send me the following:

    Please send me a UUENCODED copy of zipcrack version 2.0.
    I am in the USA and will not export the program.  I will
    erase the program before running it if I don't agree to the 
    conditions listed at the beginning of the documentation.

As before, I'm only releasing a crippled version of the program without 
sources to the public.  (Only passwords beginning with lowercase 'z' can 
be checked.)  I don't think zip encryption is adequate, and I've written 
zipcrack to demonstrate why, not to produce a crackers' tool.

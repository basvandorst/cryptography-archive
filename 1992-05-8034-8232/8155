The frequenty of letters in a list of words is pretty much irrelevant when the
issue being discussed is letter frequency tables for use in cryptography and
similar purposes.  A list of words is not anything like running text in the
language being examined, and therefore letter frequencies in a list of words
do not correspond to letter frequencies in running text.

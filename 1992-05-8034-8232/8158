A product that I compiled and sell contains a list of all substrings
of length twelve and shorter, sorted by frequency, of extracts from
current novels contrasted to a similar list derived from the KJV bible.

The extremely large word list accompanying the above files is being used
by people of the likes of Gene Spafford as a basis of a password qualifying
scheme.  This is a commercial product, so e-mail if you want further information.

Our C and Fortran compilers use the popcount instructions in a number of
different ways.  The one that comes to mind first is to find the vector
length to use for code under an IF.  We also use the C _popcnt intrinsic
in the compiler in bitvector manipulation and in computing GCD's, and
probably in other places.  I doubt if the NSA had any influence on this ;-)

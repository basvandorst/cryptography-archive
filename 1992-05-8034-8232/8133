   For those of us who don't have access to the citation (and/or are
   possibly not numerate enough), is the answer yes or no??


the answer is probably not.  the article in questin described how they
hooked a des chip up to look for short cycles which would indicate
that des formed a group.  the search wasn't exhaustive, but it did
cover enough ground to convince most people.

but the answer doesn't really matter.  as has been suggested here many
times, you can just offset the cascaded encryptions so a single bit
will affect output bits in more than one output block.

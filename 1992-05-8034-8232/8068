In which case, Dan, why don't you start using it? Dolt. :-) Okay, I'll
try MD5 (as implemented by the md5driver program) as a hash function. I
have a secret value v_n, for some large n, which nobody without access
to brnstnd@nyu.edu should be able to find out. I've computed v_i as
MD5(v_{i+1}), down to v_0 = 8f76ba819dbfb99f4d64ad5b12350c7e. v_i
expires at 705000000 + 500000i seconds after the epoch. I'll publish
each v_i soon after it expires.

If, before v_i expires, you receive a message M with a signature h and a
number i attached, and you later receive v_i, then you can compute
MD5(M + v_i) and verify that it equals h, and you can compute MD5^i(v_i)
and verify that it equals v_0 above. So you can be sure that only I
(``I'' meaning any of the people who can find out v_i before it expires)
could have produced that message. (Unless, of course, MD5 is insecure.)
Keep in mind that a v_i signature becomes completely useless after v_i
expires.

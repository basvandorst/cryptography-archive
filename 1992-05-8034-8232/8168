I've seen references to factoring via "Elliptic curves" and primality
proving via "Elliptic curves".  There's also a program for proving
that I have tested, and that seemed to work (incredibly fast, also).
Along with the program came quite much documentation about elliptic
curves but, alas, it was way above my ability to understand...  Now I
wonder what textbook(s) one should read about the matter or if there
(preferably) exists some kind of introduction to it in
computer-readable form on-line somewhere!  I'm a fast learner, so any
relevant information is much welcomed.  Just so I can get started...

If there is a "need" for it, I will put together some sort of (short)
summary and post it here or just mail interested parties to save
bandwidth.

Thanks in advance, you all!

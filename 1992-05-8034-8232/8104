A while ago I posted what I assumed was a laughably ignorant question, and
was delighted to receive a flood of thoughtful and helpful replies.  Thanks!
I now hope to get the magic to work again: I've got another question that to 
me seems pretty basic, but what the heck.

Here's some background, before I actually ask the question itself.  The post
I made a while back asked for a proof that the so-called ``one-time pad''
encryption scheme was truly unbreakable.  A number of the people who responded
said that it was essential that the pad be truly random, and not (for example)
be the output of a pseudo-random number generator (presumably because the
sequence generated by a PRNG would have a pattern in it that could be 
exploited by whoever was trying to break the code).  So I got to thinking, how 
does one
define a ``random'' stream of bits?  I vaguely recall that someone once posited
a theoretical way to *measure* the randomness of a stream of bits (namely,
write the shortest possible computer program that generates that stream, and
compare the length of that program to the length of the stream: if the program
is a lot shorter than the stream, then the stream wasn't very random), but
I still don't know precisely what randomness *is*, or how one tests a bit
stream for it.

Ideas, anyone?  References to the literature would be fine.
Thanks!

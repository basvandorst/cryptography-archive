I would like to get information on encryption hardware that may be
purchased to guard modem transmissions between the US and Japanese
offices of a combined effort.  These devices need only support a
9600 bps rate.

    I considered comp.dcom and several other groups before posting
here.  Please redirect me to a more appropriate forum if needed.
Please send mail to <davis@hpl.hp.com> and I will summarize here
or in the aforementioned more appropriate forum.

Although this has nothing to do with Crypto, I feel the best way to
prevent cheating is to analyze the reasons why students feel they need
to cheat, and address the underlying problems with the educational
system, rather than putting a band-aid on it by coming up with more
sophisticated enforcement.

Nah, forget it. It's easier just to crack down.

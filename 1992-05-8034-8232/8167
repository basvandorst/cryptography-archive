	I'm thinking about incorporating the use of a common bankcard as one
component of a remote login process (after all, people take considerable
care with the security of their bankcards).  The logical question is, What
is the data format of the mag stripe on the card- where can I get the spec
for this?  TIA.
	(Sorry if this q. seems only tangentially applicable here; I couldn't
think of a better place to ask the qustion.)

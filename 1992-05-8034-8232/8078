I have an extended abstract of Shamir's paper titled
"An efficient Identification Scheme Based on Permuted Kernels"
which appeared in the proceedings of Crypto 89.

To quote the last paragraph

"A detailed analysis of the security of the new identification scheme for
various choices of the parameters is underway, and its results will be
published in the full version of this paper.  In the meantime, we encourage
readers to attack the scheme and warn potential users not to adopt it
prematurely."

My questions are:

Does anyone know if and where the full version of the paper was published?
Has anyone successfully taken up the challenge of attacking the scheme?
Does anyone have any other comments on the security of the scheme?

Thanks in advance,

Stephen Malikoff.

It is likely that free personal PEM packages with more solid legal
status will be available in several months.  Mark Windsor, Greg
Onufer, and I have done small amounts of work on RSAREF-based programs & 
I expect that somehow amoungst the three of us, something will emerge for
public distribution, possibly in the form of a program from me with
contributions from Mark W. and Greg.  [Insert disclaimers here.]

The only individual brave enough to publicly admit to working on
his own package is Sean Coughlan, but his package appears to be 
VMS-specific.

If there's anyone else, speak up.

It's certainly a good idea to slip something between the DES stages.  If
you're going to do that, i think you might as well mix the bits up more than
just offseting them.  Ideally, each bit coming from a given block would go to
a different block in the next layer.  Even just permuting bytes would cause
each block to be connected to eight blocks in adjacent layers.  I wonder if
this permuting filter would come under export control...

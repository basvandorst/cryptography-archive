Buzz. My information was out of date. Last year (in Eurocrypt '91) two
Russians claimed that they could break the McEliece-Goppa system in what
amounts to about 2^34 operations per encrypted message in this case. I
haven't seen the details but this seems to throw a serious wrench into
doing anything useful with the system. Oh, well. Thanks to Andrew Haley
for pointing this out.

I am looking for encryption routines, either freeware or commercial which can
be linked into applications requiring security (e.g. posess an application
programming interface).  I have freeware versions of DES.  I understand RSA is
patented in the US and am trying to find pointers as to where I could purchase
RSA implementations for use inside and outside the US.

Are there other available encryption/authentication systems that are
widely available? 

I would need to implement encryption on a large variety of hosts (DOS,
Mac, OS/2, Unix, VM, VMS, MPE minimally) and portability of the system
would be essential.

Thanks.

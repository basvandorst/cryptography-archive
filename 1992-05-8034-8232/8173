It's occurred to me that one could detect copying of a programming
assignment by keeping an asymmetrically encrypted edit history of the
program file. If someone wanted to cheat by copying and changing
variable names, this could be detected by matching prefixes of the
edit histories among all assignments handed in.

Is there a simpler way of doing this, that don't involve
computationally costly public-key systems? Or are there any
suggestions on how to prevent the histories themselves from being
hacked?

The answer, according to that paper, is that DES can not be a group.

Beyond that, read the paper.

However, for skeptics in the audience, you can make sure a composition of 3
DES iterations doesn't act like a group by staggering 8-byte blocks like
bricks -- by padding each of the 3 encryption streams with 12 random bytes
(or, alternatively, padding the 2nd and 3rd ones with only 4 bytes, if you
want to be cheap with your random bytes).  Even in ECB mode, it's
impossible for such a combination to be equivalent to any single DES
operation.  A change in one input bit affects too many output bits (ie.,
more than 64).

		 11111111 11111111 11111111 ...
	     22222222 22222222 22222222 22222222 ...
	33333333 33333333 33333333 33333333 ...

Alternatively, someone suggested a while ago here in sci.crypt that
you do 4 DES rounds, each with different keys; operate on a 16-byte block;
and swap intermediate words like so:

In:	aaaaaaaa	bbbbbbbb
	  DES1		  DES2
Out:	AAAAAAAA	BBBBBBBB

In:	AAAABBBB	BBBBAAAA
	  DES3		  DES4
Out:	CCCCCCCC	DDDDDDDD

(aaaaaaaabbbbbbbb) becomes (CCCCCCCCDDDDDDDD).

This, too, can not possibly be equivalent to a single DES operation even
in ECB mode.

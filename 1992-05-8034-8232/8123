I agree that a compiler CAN look for a specific coding scheme, even
with a FEW modifications permitted, but I doubt that much more can
be done in this direction, even with human interaction. 

Instead of limiting computer users to the weak set of constructs of
C (or any other language), it is necessary to expand the set of constructs
so that the programmer can state what is wanted at least in a manner that
a bright human can recognize the substitutability of a machine procedure.

The programmer generally has an idea of what is to be accomplished, and 
should be allowed to communicate this to the compiler or whatever.  If
required to make a lengthy circumlocution, it may very well be almost
impossible for someone or something to decide what is wanted.  How easy
would it be for someone to decide that a procedure to compute trigonometric
functions to thousands of digits, described in detail, could be replaced by
one which uses the complex AGM?

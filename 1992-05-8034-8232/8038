Hmmm, every machine Seymour Cray has designed since the CDC 6600 has had
a Pop Count instruction. All of them since the Cray-1 have *also* had 
a Leading Zero count. Naturally, computers derived from those designs
(CDC Cyber 170 series, Cray X-MP and Y-MP) have *also* had those instructions.
I have heard that the Pop Count instruction was added to the 6600 at the
request of Los Alamos, not NSA, and was heavily used by a pattern matching
program that was used to analyze results of bubble chamber experiments. That
*doesn't* mean that those instructions aren't heavily used by crypto codes,
of course.

Maybe you need a smarter compiler ;-).

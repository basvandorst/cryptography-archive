I would be very surprised if

		des | simple-substitution | des

were more secure than

		des | des

but

		des | transposition | des

should increase security, provided the block over which bytes are
transposed is much larger than 8 bytes (eg., 512 bytes) because it would
diffuse the effect of a single changed input bit over that range of bytes.

Better yet, of course, would be some operation in the middle which really
diffuses changed input bits over a huge number of output bits.  My favorite
for this operation is a cousin of the FFT.  The operation in the middle
doesn't have to be all that secure, on its own.  All it needs to do is
diffuse bits.

As a more expensive variant, the FFT-like operation in the middle could use
DES as its primitive operator.  Ie., do an FFT over 32-bit quantities.
Instead of the 2x2 matrices, however, use a single DES (in CBC mode, of
course) with a different key and IV for each level of the FFT.  (over 2**N
words, you'd want N levels (= passes)) The single DES operates on 2 32-bit
words concatenated -- produces one 64-bit word which is split in half to
form the two output words.

If this is what you do in the middle, there's probably no reason for the
surrounding des's, of course :-)

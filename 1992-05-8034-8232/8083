These instructions are also used, as someone else suggested, for the
purposes of task dispatching (via a word of "flag bits" indicating
eligable tasks and an associated pointer vector), and disk space
allocation (disk allocation tables being stored as bitmaps).

The UNIVAC machines also have what might be considered "single bit"
versions of the "load shift and count" --

   Jump Negative (Positive) and Shift -- tests the sign bit of a
	 register, jumps if the sign bit is set (not set), and then
	 does a one-bit left circular shift of the register.  Useful
	 for scanning a bit stream.

Univac hardware also has "parity testing" instructions -- which test
whether a word in a register contains an even or odd number of bits.
No "population count" instructions, though.

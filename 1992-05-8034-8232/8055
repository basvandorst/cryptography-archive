Is there a non-US archive site which specializes in crypto stuff to which I
can post the latest NSEA code?  It has to be non-US to avoid the stupid
export restrictions, and a site which is already known for being a source of
crypto information would be nice.  I know some sites which have crypto stuff,
but they're all in the US (if I posted NSEA to a US site then in theory I
wouldn't even be able to ftp my own code back again.  Sigh).

Peter.

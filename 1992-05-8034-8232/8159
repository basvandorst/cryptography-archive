John Gilmore mentioned some sort of "agreement" between the Software
Publishers Association and the NSA that apparently lists the
"features" that the NSA will require for exportable cryptosoftware.

Does anyone have a complete copy of this agreement? Seems like it
should make a useful checklist of things to avoid in our own designs
for domestic use...

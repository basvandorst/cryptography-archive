   "not in the nature of C"?
   Huh?

A way that IS in the nature of C is to write code like

#ifdef COMPILER_USES_BITCOUNT_INSTRUCTION
	b = _BITCOUNT_INSTRUCTION(n) ;
#else 
	/* normal code */
	... etc. ...
#endif

Or, if you have ANSI C, do something with #pragma, and hope your
compiler doesn't mind.

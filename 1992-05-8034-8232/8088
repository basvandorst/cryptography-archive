Everybody talks about these modern machines that have a find-first-one
instruction.  Now back when I was a kid.....

      The CDC 1604 computer was happily finding-first-ones back
      in 1959.  It had a SCA (scale A) and a SCAQ (scale AQ) to
      scale 48-bit and 96-bit operands.  I believe Seymor Cray
      originally designed the machine without floating point and
      such instructions would be very handy.  The 3600 followed
      in its tracks and implemented the same instructions in a
      'non-iterative' fashion; You put the 96-bit number in at the
      bottom of a bunch of and-nor gates and the answer came out at
      the top about 7 gate times later.

      The 1604 also had a turn-paper-punch-motor-on instruction. I
      know......different group!

    This is coming from an amateur, so please excuse me if I
am being terribly dense.

    If someone is sending something over a network, he doesn't
have control over what happens -- it could be subjected to many
more layers of DES, hence some properties of iterated DES might
be of interest to him.  I think of questions like these:

    Are there key1, key2 and key3 such that 
              DES key1 | DES key 2 = DES key3
So, even if DES is not a group, perhaps sometimes this is true.
In particular, are there keys which should be avoided when 
iterating DESes?

    Is it ever the case for some key1 and key2 that 
                    DES key1 | DES key2
is easier to crack than DES key1 or DES key2?

    It seems to me that a simple substitution and/or transposition 
on the result of DES should give a demonstrable increase in 
security.  Or, perhaps, 
              DES key1 | subst&transp | DES key2
In that case, should an exceptionally paranoid person consider
doing this before sending his encrypted file out?

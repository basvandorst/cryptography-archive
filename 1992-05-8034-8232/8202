  That's an interesting idea, and pretty clever.  There's several PC reader
gadgets available from advertisers in BYTE and COMPUTER SHOPPER.  I'm sure
you could get data from them, or just buy one and test it.  According to
a recent article in the RISKS journal, there's at least the account number
and the expiration date on the stripe, some cards have much more data.

Having said that, I'd like to add that  if you put a terminal in 
front of ME and said I have to put my AMEX
card in it to work, I'd be on the phone  to the ACLU in a shot.  Does an 
employer have a right ot force an employee to use a personal credit card to
do his job?  Would a vendor service have the guts to ask?  I think the
major problems you're going to face are legal, not technical. 
  You might consider a company ID with some "intrinsic value" like useable in
company vending machines, needed to get paychecks, or some such instead.

I agree.

There's a particularly simple Reed-Solomon code that might be useful here,
the single-error-correcting RS code (255,252) over GF(256), especially in
a truncated form, e.g. (28,25). [This code is used in the IBM 3370 disk.]
Interleaved 2:1, it would correct most common transcription errors, including
transposition [provided there was no more than one error per ECC block].

Maybe this'll inspire me to get off my duff and write/post sample C code
for the RS (255,253) code...

COMP.COMPRESSION.RESEARCH CALL FOR VOTES
========================================
It is proposed that a new newsgroup be created.

   Name    : comp.compression.research.
   Charter : Discussions about data compression research.
   Status  : Unmoderated.

Many researchers have stopped reading comp.compression because of the
volume of non-research traffic. This proposal aims to create a newsgroup
specifically for research topics in data compression.

I urge you to support this proposal which has the potential to
significantly assist data compression researchers around the world.

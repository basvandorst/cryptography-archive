While doing that, you should consider padding each stream -- in UNIX pipe
terminology:

	pad|des|pad|des|pad|des

replacing the single

	des

where pad is like cat but prefixes the stream with 92 truly random
bits (= 12 bytes) and des is in CBC mode.

That padding not only disrupts patterns, but also overlaps 8-byte
encrypted blocks like bricks, adding to the diffusion of input bits.

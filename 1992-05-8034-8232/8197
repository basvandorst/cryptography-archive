   I've been playing around with several different simple ciphers, and
one I've been trying to see how to break is based on building an encoding
table, so that, to encode 'a', you look up 'a' in the table and read its
encoded value.  After each character is encoded, you use a simple pseudo-
random number generator to choose another entry in the table, and then you
swap the two encoding values.
   It's relatively easy for me to see how several other simple ciiphers
are broken, but I don't see how to attack this one.  (As I said in the
subject line, I'm an amateur....)

   Thanks,

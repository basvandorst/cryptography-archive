Great idea!  All the piddly little stuff that "irks" you when you edit
someone else's code would be PRIME targets, like:

	1.  How is white-space used?
		A.  indentations (tricky if tabstops aren't mod-8...)
		B.  between function-names and following parentheses
		C.  between names and operators
		D.  between declarations (and bodies of code)
	2.  How modular is it?
		A.  #include statements?
		B.  sub-sub-sub... function-calls?
		C.  Recursion???
	3.  How broad is the 'vocabulary' used?
	4.  Are digits used in function/variable names much?
	5.  What about upper/lower-case usage?
etc.

Still, I hardly think public-key cryptography is necessary.

The seminal work is A. N. Kolmogorov, "Three approaches to the quantitative
definition of information" in _Problems of Inform. Transmission 1_, 1 (Jan. --
March 1965), 1--7.

A superb overview may be found in the widely-available _The Art of Computer
Programming_, Volume 2, "Seminumerical Algorithms", by Donald E. Knuth,
Addison-Wesley, 1969, especially section 3.5, "What is a Random Sequence?".

The most exhaustive treatment between two covers is _Information Randomness &
Incompleteness: Papers on Algorithmic Information Theory_ by G. J. Chaitin,
World Scientific, 1987, 1990.

A recent paper, somewhat specialized but with a bibliography connecting you to
the rest of the literature, is "An Almost Machine-Independent Theory of
Program-Length Complexity, Sophistication, and Induction" by Koppel and Atlan in
the 1991 August issue of _Information Sciences_.

I could try to explain it to you in 25 seconds or less, but I won't.  There's no
substitute for RTFM!

Dear NETLANDERs,

Please would you be so kind as to help me catch-up with the latest info on
RSA. I am presently finnishing off the writing of my M.Sc. thesis which
contains a chapter on RSA encryption and would like to include the very latest
info HOT of the NET. (all info will be refernced)


Previously there have been articles about the use of RSA
within the USA based on a library of functions supplied by Public Key
Partners (? I think that is their name) which I unfortuneately did not keep.
Please would you be so kind as to mail me any info you have as to the allowed
use/distribution of this library of functions and what functions it provides.


Also if you have the dates that their patents hold till (was it 2017?) and
what if any restrictions there are in the rest of the world as regards using
RSA.

Does any one know what is the fastest encryption rate achieved under RSA with
say >512 bit moduli ?

Thanks in advance for you help

Richard.

our link to the news reader can be a little shakey :-)

There are those who believe that everything is deterministic, and that 
randomness can only be defined by complexity.  One problem with this 
approach is that it is only infinite streams which can be called fully
random.  But if one can give any mathematical rule for constructing a
stream, that stream cannot be random by any definition.

On the other hand, there is the notion of physical randomness.  It is
not the bit stream which is random, but the process which produces it
which has the property of randomness.  There are lots of tests for
randomness, but if too many are used on a finite length stream, it
is likely that it will fail some.

Under the usual model, the stream of all 0's is as likely as any other
particular stream.  We can never say that a particular stream is not
random, only that it does not work well for the purposes.  If one uses
a random stream to encode as with the one-time pad, all output messages
of a given length are equally likely, no matter what the input message.
This is a simple theorem in probability.

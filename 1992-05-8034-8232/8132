Nevertheless, it does work. Carl Ellison's recollection is that a
similar scheme---if not the same thing---was mentioned by Silvio Micali
a few years ago.

As you point out, and as I took pains to stress in the original article,
this scheme truly is time-limited: a key set up to last 500 days really
will last only 500 days, and a message signed with the 237th subkey
simply cannot be verified by someone who doesn't receive it before day
237. It is not correct to conclude that messages can be forged. They
cannot.

Your comment that ``in general public key encryption techniques work
better'' doesn't make sense to me---this *is* a public-key signature
system, although it has a somewhat different flavor from, say, DSS. You
most certainly *can* put your time-limited key on a business card and
use that key to send people messages.

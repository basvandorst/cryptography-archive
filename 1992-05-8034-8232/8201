>>Let's hope that people who receive your business card have access

	I dunno. There are nice examples of metrocards and similar things
that are paper cards with a magnetic stripe. That'd be pretty doable.
Barcodes would be pretty doable but they'd need to be *BIG* barcodes.

	Here in the DC subways, the "fare card" has a magnetic strip that
is used to store your fare information. Similar technologies would be
great for PKCs - the next step would be if portable electronic daytimers
like the "wizard" had a magstrip reader, so I could exchange PKeys
with people and store them locally.

	I have hear interesting rumbles about inital experiments for
"electronic cash cards" - a card that you'd "charge" by feeding real
cash into and could then use as cash by validating your authority to
spend the cash on that card by matching some key on it with a PIN.
Such a card would be a great place to store ancillary information
like PKeys, medical history, and a Gif picture of me with my cats. ;)

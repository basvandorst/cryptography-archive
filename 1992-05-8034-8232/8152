      Yes, the McLauren and Marseglia random number generator.  The
original source is J. Assoc. Comp. Mach. 12, (1965).  I used that
algorithm to encrypt passwords in 1976, when developing a security
system for UNIVAC 1108 mainframe computers.  Each password made
10 trips through the random number generator.  I verified that
a change of one bit in the plaintext changed close to half the bits
in the cyphertext for a range of test cases, so it at least has good
mixing properties.

I pubished the first paper on it: "The Use of Elliptic Curves in
Cryptography", in Proceedings of Crypto '85 (Springer Lecture Notes in
Comp. Sci. # 218).  This paper argues that the analogue of the
discrete log problem for Elliptic Curves will most likely not be prone
to the kind of "index calculus" attacks that have been successfully
used on the ordinary discrete log.  Also, since there are lots of
elliptic curves to choose on, you can find one whose order is
divisible by a fairly large prime.  See subsequent proceedings of
EuroCrypt and Crypto for developments.

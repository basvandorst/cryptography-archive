   Directly from page 22, Dr Dobbs May 1992:

   "After legal threats by RSA Data Security, Zimmerman agreed not to
   distribute or update the program [PGP], ...".

   Just a week ago (long after this must have been written) Phil complained
   about being busy with PGP 2.0 (or whatever). Where does the statement of
   Dr Dobbs (Bruce Schneier) come from? Did RSA (or PKP) threath Phil?

So far as is known, Phil no longer has anything to do with PGP.

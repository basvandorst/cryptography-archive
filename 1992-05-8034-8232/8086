Here are a couple of news items related to the Digital Signature
Standard (DSS) proposed by the National Institute of Standards
and Technology.  They are paraphrased by me.

The 9 March 92 issue of MacWeek announced, on page 4, the June
availability of a Macintosh encryption application from Information
Security Corp.  The application, named SecretAgent, will use 
public key encryption "to protect sensitive files".
SecretAgent will use DSS, the first Mac package to do so.

A February update to Information Security's DOS version uses
a "sender-authentication algorithm" from NIST.  I am not sure what
algorithm they are talking about--the article bills it as distinct from DSS 
but apparently as controversial.

Information Security expects to have patent issues resolved by
the time SecretAgent is released.  They are predictably unconcerned
by the controversy over DSS.  Phone number: (708)405-0500.

The 4 May 92 issue of MacWeek contains, on page 4, a brief article
on a lawsuit filed by the Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility.
They want the government to release materials related to the
development of NIST-DSS.  (The fact that the National Security
Agency developed DSS has caused some observers to be suspicious
of the algorithm.)

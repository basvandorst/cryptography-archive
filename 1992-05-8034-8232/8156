Designers who are caught between the fear of agorithms which might turn out
to be weak, and the fear of keysearch attacks on DES, have yet another way
out: permute the s-boxes. Any nontrivial permutation will defeat a dedicated
keysearch machine.

I actually implemented this for a bank many years ago, in a password file
encryption routine. It defeats the standard cracking approaches, and it would
appear to be open whether this `extended DES' is a group - although I can see
no reason to suppose that it is.

Incidentally, a colleague found out that Robotron, a semiconductor supplier
in the former East Germany, supplied tens of thousands of DES chips to the
Soviets during the eighties. The supposed application was in hard disk
controllers for XT cloneskis. Either the Russians built a keysearch machine, 
or they use DES so widely that NSA would be grossly negligent not to have 
built one.

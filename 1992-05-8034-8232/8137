One of our new programmers mistakenly type 'X' rather than 'x' to exit
from vi.  He did not notice the 'Enter Key' prompt and bashed several keys
before acutally exiting.  His file is now encrypted and he can not remember
the key sequence that was entered for the key, and has consequently lost
a mornings work.

The question I would like answered is what type of encryption is used, and
is there a way to decrypt this file.  I am not asking for a method, since
you have no way of believing what I say - I might be trying to read other
peoples private files (I'm not, but then I would say that 8-).  The work
will have been re-done by the time replies get back to me anyway, so that is
why a solution is no good to me.  All I would like is a basic description
of what method it uses - try and keep the language simple, since one-time
pads are about my limit.

Ain't curiosity a bummer.


Thanks in advance

David

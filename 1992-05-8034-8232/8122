I was curious about this point myself when I read the original 
article.

For those of us who don't have access to the citation (and/or are
possibly not numerate enough), is the answer yes or no???  Is it 
answerable in yes or no terms.

To quote Adm. Nimitz's (or his code officer) when messaging Halsey at Leyte,
 "The world wonders."


Thanks in advance,

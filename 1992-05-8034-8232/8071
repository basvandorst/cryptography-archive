The DEC-20 (a 36-bit mainframe forerunner of the VAX) had a Find First
One and Jump instruction (back in 1979 when I last worked on one).

The 80x86 architecture has a parity flag that can give you the last bit
of a popcount.  However, the XLAT instruction (8-bit lookup table)
is probably the fastest implementation.

Directly from page 22, Dr Dobbs May 1992:
"After legal threats by RSA Data Security, Zimmerman agreed not to distribute
or update the program [PGP], ...".

Just a week ago (long after this must have been written) Phil complained
about being busy with PGP 2.0 (or whatever). Where does the statement of
Dr Dobbs (Bruce Schneier) come from? Did RSA (or PKP) threath Phil?

I've had Arto Karila's document in unmanageable postscript format
on my system for a year and finally wrote a C program to strip out
the text. It's quite readable, though I've lost the text attributes
and am still recovering the superscript/subscript and other codes
from the Comms and crypto protocol examples.

All the figures are lost. If anyone (maybe Arto) could send me the
figures in ASCII or GIF format, I will post the text to these groups.

It is a very good paper (all 136 pages worth), and I only wish I could
read the Finnish references he cites. I am doing a security architecture
for a large commercial (Bank) network, and any one else doing similar work
will find Arto's paper very useful.

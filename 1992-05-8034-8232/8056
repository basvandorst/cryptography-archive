Some time ago, in a discussion of the proposed NSEA encryption algorithm,
I made the statement that "a mark of a good cipher is that a small change
in plaintext results in a large change in ciphertext."  Several people
objected to this statement.  For example, Dan Bernstein asserted that a
one-time pad has the property that a small change in plaintext produces
a small change in ciphertext.

I believe this statement of Dan's to be incorrect, as the one-time pad must
be used twice for this to be observed.

I did a few experiments with messages that look like this:

    DEPOSIT THE SUM OF $1000 INTO MY ACCOUNT

and,

    DEPOSIT THE SUM OF $9000 INTO MY ACCOUNT

Given ciphertext only (in CFB mode), it was not difficult to transform
one into the other.  In other words, the message could be altered in
transit to change its meaning.  Also, if the same key is used, the
ciphertext up to the character representing the first number is
identical, so that the cipher is vulnerable to traffic analysis.

Under these circumstances, I can not retract my original statement.

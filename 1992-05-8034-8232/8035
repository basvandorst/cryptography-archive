The DEC 6/10 so often nostalgized (like that word!) about had a
JumpifFindFirstOne instruction, useful for floating fixed point
numbers and such.

The Philco 2000 machines (I'm REALLY old) had JumpQNEGative and
POSitive instructions which were useful for doing both operations
quickly which tested the sign bit of the Q register AND shifted it
left one bit; they were heavily pipelined machines optimized so that
short loops using these instructions were very (we're talking early
60s here) fast.

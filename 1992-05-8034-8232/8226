Does anyone have, or know of a documented design or implementation of an
authentication system using either smart-cards or (perhaps pseudo-random)
challenge/response pairs?

I'm currently searching the literature, but am looking for all the help I
can get.  I'm looking for references to challenge/response authentication
schemes where the responses may be calculated or predetermined.

I'm most interested in working UNIX implementations, especially those I
could look at (or borrow).

Please respond via email to:
	poepping@sei.cmu.edu

thanks in advance.

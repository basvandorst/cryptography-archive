This instruction was Jump if Find First One (JFFO)...  JFFO AC,E meant
"if AC is non-zero, load a count of the leading zeros in AC into AC+1
and jump to E; if AC is zero, clear AC+1 and don't jump"... my college
had both a KA10-based DEC-10 and a KL10-based DEC-20 and JFFO was
present on both of them, so if JFFO were added at a potential
customer's request (as I heard back then), it must have been added a
_long_ time ago...  To use a tight JFFO loop in disk block allocation,
TENEX and TOPS-20 used 36-bit maps with one-bits for free blocks and
zero-bits for allocated blocks.

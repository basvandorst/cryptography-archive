The (extremely) odd Modular One had both, as option bits on its shift 
instruction.  Popcount was achieved by a Tally/Logical shift - it gave 
you the count for the number of bits you shifted out (I don't remember 
which of its many curious registers got the result).  Find First was a
Justify/Logical shift (again, it told you how far it had gone, but I 
don't remember where).

The Modular One was an Iann Barron development - an expensive machine, 
but (for its time) very fast (implemented in MECL 2).  The company
didn't do too well (the PDP-11 came along and was more friendly to
programmers ;-), but Iann eventually resurfaced launching the
Transputer. 

I don't imagine the NSA had anything to do with the instruction set of 
the Modular One.  The instructions (at least justify) were slated as
being for software emulation of floating point.

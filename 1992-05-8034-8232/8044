The 6600 certainly had population count; I used it.  Note that it was about
the SLOWEST instruction in the whole instruction set.  I'll have to dig out
the COMPASS manuals when I get home and find out just HOW slow.

Parity was never added to the 6000 line, that came with the 7000 line.

Why did I use it?  Well, I could tell you but I'd have to kill you
afterwards...

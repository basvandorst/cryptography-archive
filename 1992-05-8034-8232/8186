I was looking around at my encryption options, and I was wondering if
someone could tell me what the "best" algorithm for me would be.
I have a lot of text files and some binary files that I'd like to encrypt.
They are for my personal use only, so I don't have to worry about public
keys or the like.  What algorithm would offer me the highest amount of
security?  I'd like something that would be government resistant :)
Also, are there applications for the mac that implement this algorithm?
If not, where can I get source to write my own?

On a related note... what is the most recent version of PGP?  Where can
I FTP its source?

Thanks in advance for the help.

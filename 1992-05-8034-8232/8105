There are ways of making a cryptographic system very difficult to break
by putting in a sufficiently complicated "trap door".  Public key
cryptography is of this type.  This can make it too expensive to
break.

But other than that, what one group can break, another can also.
There is no reason to believe that NSA can have a monopoly on people
who can think of how to break codes.

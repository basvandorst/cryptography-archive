    [...interesting discussion on using FFT...]
    Well, I mentioned using substitution because I recall reading
a reference which said, if I recall correctly, that
               substitution|des|inverse substitution
was stronger than DES.  But I guess what I'm really thinking of
is this situation:  I am sending a very important message out over 
a network, where I have reason to believe that the network will 
use DES to encrypt what it receives.  It may also forward the 
message through other systems, where they may do further DES.  
Would it be absurd of me to do a transposition of my output from 
DES -- it is a piece of cake to do it -- before sending it out to 
the network?  Would it be absurd for an intermediary who uses DES 
to consider doing a transposition after a DES before sending 
messages on?
    The point is -- doing a transposition is *such* a simple thing
to do -- yet it superficially seems to have significant benefits --
why not do it?
   
    Footnote:  A simple-minded combinatorial argument about
simple substitutions.  There are 256! simple substitutions on a
byte.  256! > 2^56 (the number of DES keys).  Hence, you get some
new results by doing substitution after DES.  Also, is there some 
simple method of extending the group generated by DES beyond the 
alternating group to the group of all permutations?  (I will 
probably deserve any flames I get for getting so far out of my 
depth.)

Ahem.  You should read Seizing the Enigma, David Kahn's latest book.
It's clear that the machines that were built to solve the German
Enigma cipher relied very heavily on brute force.

Even differential cryptanalysis relies on "brute force", if you consider
that running 2^46th plaintexts through a box is brute force.  It's only
a factor of 500 from "real brute force", 2^55th plaintexts.

It's not NSA's purity of mathematical thought that causes it to be the
largest consumer of supercomputers in the world.  It's their need for large
numbers of crunchons to try lots of combinations.  While they may know
ways of directing their searches to avoid trying *all* the combinations,
they are still using variants on brute force.

One of the interesting things to come out of the Software Publishers
Association draft agreement with NSA was their agreement that `It shall
be permissible to pre-fix an initialization vector to any plain text
message that is to be encrypted with RC4.  The initialization vector
itself will appear in plain text in the message itself...'  While brute
force attacks would work on the first block of a message whose
initialization vector was known, they would not work against use of
block chaining from an unknown initialization vector.  (True?)

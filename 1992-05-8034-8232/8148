There is, however, the case of "key collisions" in DES as
reported some years ago by Quisquater, et al. 
This is the case where, for a given plaintext P there exists
two keys, KA and KB, that produce THE SAME CIPHERTEXT.
The papers are in the Crypto proceedings.
This is really not the same as DES being a GROUP.

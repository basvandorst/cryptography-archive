Surely one isn't going to be typing these things in? Keys are just to
plain long to be typing in. Grouping them like this adds 20% to the
size, a big price to pay if almost no one gains from it. The point of
my request was to think of a more compact arrangement.

I did some playing around to see what I could do. Here's an actual 767
bit public key*. I RFC1113 encoded the various pieces of it. This is
small enough to tuck into a signature:

RSApubkey b=767 x=AQABT m=Y3Ed0B9p5bFdYWzp8Cg9EvAcIdwj8x3xPB/CMGcdDY10gVB/07Y\
4PeloOxAe8THS7bmHthspF3QnYPEuV/H9Rx3FAGaG13Q+7BQFAJ1QUBaQ5xUzviJQFUBzcV3tsfTV

Where b=bits, x=exponent, and m=modulus.

Who knows? Within a few years, news and mail readers may have
intelligence to pick keys out of several formats, as well as polling a
key authority.

* - Why 767? A like it because it's harder to crack. Requires prime
factorization of a 231 digit number, versus factoring a 155 digit
number when using a 512 bit RSA key.

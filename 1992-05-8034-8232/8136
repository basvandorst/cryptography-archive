              Datamation  magazine     May 1, 1992     has an article on
page 23 entitled            On Second Thought....

      It's about a researcher at Texas that created a NetWare Loadable
Module that creates a backdoor into the net(novell) by changing the
password to the word 'supervisor'. He released the NLM over the
internet.
                  Anybody got it?

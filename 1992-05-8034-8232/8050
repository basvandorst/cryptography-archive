From the transputer databook (1st edition, 1989)

IMS T800

OP code	Mnemonic	Proc. cyc.	Name
------- --------	----------	----
76	bitcnt		b + 2		count bits set in word
77	bitrevword	36		reverse bits in word
78	bitrevnbits	n + 4		reverse bottom n bits in word

b = Bit number of the highest bit set in register A. Bit 0 is the least
	significant bit.
n = Number of places shifted

Proc. cyc. refers to the number of periods TPCLPL taken by an instruction
executing in internal memory.

Features and fixes to add (or think about adding), in no particular order:

	Implement configuration	through	command-line options rather than
	  rebuilding.  Perhaps writing the driver as a stand-alone
	  executable with an uninstall function.

        Add a buffer for /dev/random so that more than 512 bits of entropy
          can be saved.

        Add more functions to the API (IOCTL), such as Sample-until-full,
          change thresholds, etc...

	Add a critical-error handler that wipes	entropy	pool when certain
	  errors occur?

	Write more demo	utilities and interface	routines. (A TSR which
	  samples /dev/random and over time generates a	file of	random
	  noise	while in the background	would be nice.)

	Write OS/2, Windows 3.x/95 ports.  Make	the driver Windows aware,
	  so that it will function somewhat better when	Windows	is active.

	Add sampling of	video-card scan	lines, more IRQs, and any other
	  interesting sources.

	Add a usable implementation of clock-drift sampling?

	Add sampling of	Pentium's internal timestamp counter (RDTSC
	  instruction),	and possibly timers/counters from other	devices
	  (sound cards,	IO cards, video	cards...)

	A 286-port of the driver (maybe).

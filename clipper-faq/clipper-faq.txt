TWIMC:

I put this together on the Clipper controvery, but it seems
to get garbled when I try to post this from my shell account 
up on the newsgroups that discuss the Clipper issue.

I've had this checked out for accurarcy by some friends in
The crypto biz.  If you think this is appropriate could you find an 
place for this on the net or let me know if it needs
some modifications?  A slightly different version of this was published
in Computer Underground Digest a week ago. There are some issues,
especially dealing with exportabililty, that I think need more
discussion on the newsgroups that I've been following on the issue.

WHAT IS THE CLIPPER CHIP?

The Clipper chip  is an encryption  chip using an  algorithm
called Skipjack.   The Skipjack algorithm  was developed  by
the  National  Security  Agency   (NSA)  for  the   National
Institute of  Standards and Technology (NIST).

Data encrypted using the Skipjack algorithm can be decrypted
using a  secret process  that  requires two  separate  keys.
These keys  would be  escrowed separately  by NIST  and  the
Department of Treasury.  Under  the plan, a law  enforcement
agency  would require a court order to get the two keys that
would  have  to  be  combined  to  decrypt  a  transmission,
generated with   a Clipper chip  as well as  to monitor  the
transmission itself.

HOW DOES THE SKIPJACK ALGORITHM DO THIS?

Encryption algorithms use numbers called keys that are  like
combinations  to  a  lock.    Messages  are  encrypted   and
decrypted much the  same as locks  are locked and  unlocked.
The key to any Clipper  encoded message is itself  encrypted
using a  key derived  from two  other keys  that are  stored
separately.  The encrypted  key and a number that identifies
the chip  that  sent the  message  are then  encrypted  with
another key that is common to many other chips, known as the
family key. All of  this is sent   along with the  encrypted
original message in what is  called a LEAF (Law  Enforcement
Access Field). This is done so  if a law enforcement  agency
wants to decrypt a message the process can be reversed:  The
outer portion of the encrypted key  is decrypted to get  the
number that identifies the unit  that sent the message. This
identification number  is used  to obtain  the two  separate
escrowed keys  that are then combined to decrypt the session
key  that allows the original message to be decrypted.

        Let's look at another way. You have the session  key
S,  the key E derived from the two escrowed keys, the family
key F, the message M and  the chip identification number  C.
It's all  put  together  like this:   (M encrypted with  key
S)+(((S encrypted with key E) C )encrypted with F)

IS THE SYSTEM SECURE?

If everything goes right, according to  the a panel of  five
cryptography experts who have reviewed it.

WHAT ALGORITHM DOES THE ACTUAL ENCRYPTION?

That is classified information.

BUT AREN'T  GOOD  ENCRYPTION ALGORITHMS  SECURE,  EVEN  WHEN
EVERYONE KNOWS WHAT THEY ARE, LIKE DES?

Yes.

THEN WHY NOT JUST PUBLISH THE ALGORITHM?

The reasons cited are that compromising the algorithm  would
be detrimental to national security.  This means that secret
techniques are used in the algorithm.

SO A GOVERNMENT SECRET IS GOING TO BE IN THOUSANDS OF  THESE
CLIPPER CHIPS SHIPPED ALL OVER THE WORLD?

That's the plan.

SO IF SOMEONE FIGURES OUT HOW TO GET THE ALGORITHM FROM  THE
CLIPPER CHIPS, OUR NATIONAL SECURITY COULD BE COMPROMISED?

If you follow the NSA's logic, yes.

LAW  ENFORCEMENT  OFFICIALS  ARE  GOING  TO  BE  USING   THE
ALGORITHM  AND  THE  FAMILY  KEY  MANY  TIME  TO  GET   UNIT
IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS.   LET'S  SAY THAT  THE ALGORITHM  IS
LEAKED.  OR  ONE OF  THE BLACK BOXES  THAT WILL  BE USED  TO
DECRYPT THE  CHIPS  IS  COMPROMISED AND  THE  ALGORITHM  AND
FAMILY KEYS ARE GENERALLY KNOWN. WHAT WILL HAPPENS THEN?

The algorithm  could  be  subject  to  tampering.  From  our
explanation in  question two  we would  go  from this:    (M
encrypted  with  key  S)+(((S   encrypted  with  key  E)   C
)encrypted with F)   to this   (M encrypted  with key  S)+(S
encrypted with key E) C.   This would leave the chip  number
open to tampering.  Also in  theory it would allow a  steady
attack on the key E, that  would compromise the unit.   This
attack is  theoretically  better than  attacking  a  message
without the law enforcement field, but even if the key S  is
known (by getting  someone with a  chip with to  send you  a
message with a key  you have negotiated)  it would still  be
difficult with today's computer power.   In any case  anyone
with anything  to  hide  wouldn't use  a  Clipper  chip  for
transmissions they wanted to keep secret from law
enforcement authorities.

MOST ENCRYPTION IS  DONE WITH  SOFTWARE.   CAN THE  SKIPJACK
ALGORITHM BE USED IN SOFTWARE ENCRYPTING SYSTEMS?

No.  The  nature of the  Skipjack algorithm   makes it  only
useful if it is  released in a special tamper proof chip.

SO THE ALGORITHM  IS ONLY USEFUL  FOR APPLICATIONS THAT  CAN
USE HARDWARE ENCRYPTION?

Yes.

WHAT IF I  WANT TO ENCRYPT  A MESSAGE WITH  A REALLY  SECURE
ALGORITHM BEFORE IT IS ENCRYPTED BY A CLIPPER CHIP?

That would be  a simple and  obvious way to  get around  the
Clipper chip.

BUT ISN'T MOST ENCRYPTION  CURRENTLY DONE USING SOFTWARE  ON
GENERAL PURPOSE MICROPROCESSORS?

Yes.

SO  CLIPPER     WON'T   BE   USEFUL  FOR   MOST   ENCRYPTION
APPLICATIONS?

Yes.

IS CLIPPER GOING TO BE EASIER TO EXPORT THAN DES?

According to the Clinton administration, yes.

IS THERE A FOREIGN MARKET FOR CLIPPER ENCRYPTION DEVICES?

For there to  be a  market there needs  to be  a reason  for
foreign purchasers to prefer Skipjack or Clipper  technology
to currently available algorithms.  This has not been  shown
to be true.   There a report in  the British press that  the
NSA has  a  representative  in  London  that  is    lobbying
European governments to adopt the  Clipper chip.

WHAT IF  A FOREIGN  GOVERNMENT WANTS  TO  SPY ON  THEIR  OWN
CITIZENS, WILL WE GIVE THEM THE KEYS TO DO THIS?

 This question will need to be answered before any chips are
exported.  There  are a limited  number of  options: We  can
give any country that imports the  chips the keys up  front,
we can give them to them if they ask (and make case by  case
judgments), we  can  give  them to  an  international  third
party, or we can not give the keys to them at all.

WHAT IF  A  FOREIGN  GOVERNMENT ALLOWS  THE  IMPORTATION  OF
CLIPPER CHIPS, BUT ONLY IF THEY  GET THE KEYS FIRST?   WOULD
WE BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR ABUSE?

That is a question that needs public discussion.

IF WE  ONLY GIVE  THEM THE  KEY WHEN  THEY ASK,  WHAT IF  WE
SUSPECT THE  KEYS  THEY  WANT ARE  TO  SPY  ON  A  POLITICAL
ADVERSE. WHAT IF  A FOREIGN  GOVERNMENT DECIDES  TO MAKE  AN
ISSUE OF US NOT GIVING  THEM  THE KEYS TO A CLIPPER CHIP  WE
SOLD THEM?  HOW WILL WE DEAL WITH THIS?

We would be in a no win  situation.  Not only would we  have
an ethical problem, we would have a political one.

WHAT ABOUT  GIVING  THE  KEYS  TO  CHIPS  WE  EXPORT  TO  AN
INTERNATIONAL THIRD PARTY BODY?  WOULD THIS MAKE THE PROBLEM
EASIER?

Whoever had  the  keys  would  have  the  same  ethical  and
political problems

IF WE DON'T GIVE THE KEYS TO ANY EXPORTED CHIPS TO IMPORTING
COUNTRIES, WILL THESE COUNTRIES ALLOW THIS?

It is not  likely that foreign  governments would find  this
acceptable.

WILL THE  NSA  GET  THE KEYS  TO  SKIPJACK  UNITS  THAT  ARE
EXPORTED?

Government officials have said to  some people that the  NSA
will not get these  keys. The NSA has  not yet said this  on
the record.

HAVE ORGANIZATIONS THAT REPRESENT THE COMPUTER HARDWARE  AND
SOFTWARE INDUSTRIES ASKED FOR A NEW ALGORITHM TO EXPORT?

Both the Software  Publishing Association  and the  American
Electronics Association, along  with other industry  groups,
have asked that the DES algorithm be made available for easy
export.  The DES algorithm is already available all over the
world.  DES is classified as a munition by the US government
and cannot be exported easily.  The DES algorithm is thought
by most cryptography professionals to be nearing the end  of
it's useful life and new  exportable algorithms that can  be
implemented in  software  need  to  be  standardized.    The
Skipjack algorithm does not answer this need.

THE ANNOUNCEMENT FROM  THE WHITE HOUSE  ON FEBRUARY 4,  1994
SPOKE ABOUT THE  PROBLEM OF "TERRORISTS,  DRUG DEALERS,  AND
OTHER CRIMINALS" USING ENCRYPTION.  WILL THE CLIPPER CHIP DO
ANYTHING TO  PREVENT THESE  PEOPLE FROM  USING  NON-ESCROWED
ENCRYPTION TECHNIQUES?

No. These  people  will be  able  to encrypt  with  whatever
algorithm they want.

ARE THERE  OTHER WAYS  OF  ESCROWING KEYS  VOLUNTARILY,  FOR
GOVERNMENTAL   AND   BANKING   NEEDS   THAT   REQUIRE   BOTH
CONFIDENTIALITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY?

Yes.  There is work being done now on techniques that  allow
much more  flexible  ways  of  voluntarily  escrowing  keys.
These techniques can  be implemented in  software and  would
not require government intervention.

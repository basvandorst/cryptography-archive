Short descriptor: Deniable encryption based on Rivest's winnowing

Other comments: The source is a little dirty, but it works on an
Intel/Linux box. The concepts are all simple, and it shows how to use the
one-way functions (SHA and MD5) to achieve the ends of winnowing and
deniable encryption.

** NOTE, I previously uploaded wino_chaf.tgz, which does not have
RC4 support. Please remove that incomplete version.

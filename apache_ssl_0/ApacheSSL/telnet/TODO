Suggestions of things to add to this:

From tjh@mincom.oz.au
    - S-Key support ... why not throw it in while we are changing code 
    and it will mean that if we don't support SSL and we still want to 
    run in a more secure mode that the "standard" ftpd then we can do
    so ... and it isn't that difficult to add

From bambi@bond.edu.au
    - change the protocol so that the user is passed through first so
    that those accounts that don't require SSL (like anon-ftp) can
    work as is without the encryption overhead
    - also will allow us to run in "-z secure" mode all the time for
    those machines that we don't really want access to except for 
    the anon side of things.
    - also should change the telnet/telnetd code to allow the same
    functionality (for those sites that have existing security 
    mechanisms but want to add SSL in preference where available)

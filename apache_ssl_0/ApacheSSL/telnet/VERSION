Version 0.5 18-Sep-1995 tjh (tjh@mincom.oz.au)
        - fixed up SSL_accept, SSL_connect as Eric changed the return 
        codes on me without letting me know (again)!
	- fixed up inet_addr.c for SunOS 4.1.3 as per email from
	Nicolas Pioch <pioch@Email.ENST.Fr>
	- yet another linux patch - this time to fix termio includes
	thanks to Warwick Heath <warwick@rcc-irc.si>
	- include the security patch (modified) for removing unwanted
	things from the environment of telnetd (things that effect
	shared libraries) as per the CERT announcement. Note that
	this patch doesn't log a hack attempt explicitly - perhaps
	it should. (01-Nov-95) 
	
Version 0.4 18-Jul-1995 tjh (tjh@mincom.oz.au) 
        - updated to the new error handling stuff in SSLeay-0.4.4
	and added -cipher=cipherlist and printout of subject
	and issuer of the certificate offered by the server.

Version 0.3 09-Jul-1995 tjh (tjh@mincom.oz.au)
        - 01-Jul-95 tjh - merged patches from Steven Schoch 
	<schoch@sheba.arc.nasa.gov> that add in the option of having
	a file that allows you to not have to enter a password if you
	have a matching certificate (and the server is running with
	the new -z certsok option and the user is in /etc/ssl.users)
	[look in lib/libtelnet/ssl.c for more details until I document
	this a little better]
        - 30-Jun-95 tjh - applied the CERT advisory security patch that
	I happened to have missed before to bring the code up to date
	with the "current" BSD telnetd auth stuff
        -  set utmp entry to be tn0xff0xff so that comsat doesn't find
	the entry twice - really need to know what the *real* id should
	be set to. (SunOS 5.x) ... and this is still not *right*
        -  fixed up building under SunOS 4.1.3 
	thanks to Nicolas Pioch <pioch@Email.ENST.Fr>
	- telnet client now builds cleanly on 
	SunOS 4.x, SunOS 5.x, IRIX 5.x, HPUX 9.x, DGUX 5.x, Linux
        - telnetd fixes for Linux from bogk@inf.fu-berlin.de (Andreas Bogk) 
        to work around an ncurses "feature" ... see terminaltypeok()
	which was also emailed in by aeppert@dialin.ind.net a few weeks 
	later
	- telnetd has now been tested on
	SunOS 5.x, IRIX 5.x, Linux

Version 0.2 09-Jun-1995 tjh (tjh@mincom.oz.au)
        - fixed up the handling of utmpx so that we can use the "normal"
	/bin/login program rather than our separate login program which
	fixed the SunOS 5.3 problem
	No utmpx entry. You must exec "login" from the lowest level "shell".
	- thanks to bogk@inf.fu-berlin.de (Andreas Bogk) for pointing
	out that I hadn't cleaned up that part of the SRA base I've 
	built on top of.
	- HPUX builds now ... still need to put in the pty handling code
	if I want telnetd to work I think

Version 0.1 06-Jun-1995 tjh (tjh@mincom.oz.au)
        - first "released" version. Code is really still pre-alpha as
	it was implemented last night so at the moment use it at your
	own risk. :-)

Please note that location.h contains the directory path, and the file used
by X509_set_default_verify_paths() to specify the default CA certificate
directors and/or file and the environment variable to use.

NOTE:
If a certificate contains a DN that is not a PRINTABLESTRING object,
this information will be lost if you convert the certificate to 'TEXT'
format.  The certificate issued by https://www.rsa.com/ has it's last
field of type T61STRING.  So don't convert it to text and back again
and expect it to be the same.  To check if there are non
PRINTABLESTING types, use derparse.

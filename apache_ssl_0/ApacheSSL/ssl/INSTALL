# Installation of SSLeay.
# It depends on perl for a few bits but those steps can be skipped and
# the top level makefile edited by hand

# When bringing the SSLeay distribution back from the evil intel world
# of Windows/MSDOS, do the following to make it nice again under unix :-)
# You don't normally need to run this.
sh util/fixdos.sh

# If things have been stuffed up with the sym links, run
make -f Makefile.ssl links
# This will re-populate lib/include with symlinks and for each
# directory, link Makefile to Makefile.ssl

# Setup the machine dependent stuff for the top level makefile
# and some select .h files
# If you don't have perl, this will bomb, in which case just edit the
# top level Makefile.ssl
./Configure 'system type'

# The 'Configure' command contains default configuration parameters
# for lots of machines.  Configure edits 5 lines in the top level Makefile
# It modifies the following values in the following files
Makefile.ssl		CC CFLAG EX_LIBS BN_MULW
crypto/des/des_locl.h	DES_USE_PTR
crypto/md/md2.h		MD2_INT
crypto/rc4/rc4.h	RC4_INT
crypto/rc4/rc4_enc.c	RC4_INDEX
crypto/idea/idea.h	IDEA_INT
crypto/bn/bn.h		BN_LLONG (and defines one of SIXTY_FOUR_BIT,
				  THIRTY_TWO_BIT or SIXTEEN_BIT)

# Edit crypto/location.h to set the install locations.

# clean out all the old stuff
make clean

# Do a make depend only if you have the makedepend command installed
# This is not needed but it does make things nice when developing.
make depend	

# make should build everything
make

# fix up the demo certificate hash directory if it has been stuffed up.
make rehash

# test everything
make test

# install the lot
make install

# It is worth noting that all the applications are built into the one
# program, ssleay, which is then has links from the other programs
# names to it.

have fun

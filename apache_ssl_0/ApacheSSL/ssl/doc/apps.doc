The applications

Ok, where to begin....
In the begining, when SSLeay was small (April 1995), there
were but few applications, they did happily cohabit in
the one bin directory.  Then over time, they did multiply and grow,
and they started to look like microsoft software; 500k to print 'hello world'.
A new approach was needed.  They were coalessed into one 'Monolithic'
application, ssleay.  This one program is composed of many programs that
can all be compiled independantly.

ssleay has 3 modes of operation.
1) If the ssleay binaray has the name of one of its component programs, it
executes that program and then exits.  This can be achieve by using hard or
symbolic links, or failing that, just renaming the binary.
2) If the first argument to ssleay is the name of one of the component
programs, that program runs that program and then exits.
3) If there are no arguments, ssleay enters a 'command' mode.  Each line is
interpreted as a program name plus arguments.  After each 'program' is run,
ssleay returns to the comand line.

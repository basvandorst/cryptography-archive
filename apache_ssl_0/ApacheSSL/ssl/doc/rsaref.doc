This package can be compiled to use the RSAref library.
This library is not allowed outside of the USA but inside the USA it is
claimed by RSA to be the only RSA public key library that can be used.

There are 2 files, rsa/rsaref.c and rsa/rsaref.h that contain the glue
code to use RSAref.  These files have been written by looking at the PGP
source code and seeing which routines it used to access RSAref.
I have also been sent by some-one a copy of the RSAref header file that
contains the library error codes.

They have now been tested against the recently announced RSAEURO
library.

There are 2 ways to use SSLeay and RSAref.  First, to build so that
the programs must be linked with RSAref, add '-DRSAref' to CFLAG
and '-lRSAref' to EX_LIBS in the top level makefile.

The second method is to build as per normal and link applications with
the RSAglue library.  The correct library order would be
cc -o cmd cmd.o -lssl -lRSAglue -lcrypto -lRSAref -ldes
The RSAglue library is built in the rsa directory and is NOT
automatically installed.

Be warned that the RSAEURO library, that is claimed to be compatible
with RSAref contains a different value for the maximum number of bits
supported.  This changes structure sizes and so if you are using
RSAEURO, change the value of RSAref_MAX_BITS in rsa/rsaref.h

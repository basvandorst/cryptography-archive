<H1>How it works</H1>
<P>It would help if you were already familiar with the concept of
cryptography in general and public key cryptography in particular. 
Nonetheless, here are a few introductory remarks about public key
cryptography.
<P>First, some elementary terminology.  Suppose I want to send you a
message, but I don't want anyone but you to be able to read it.  I can
<I>encrypt</I>, or <I>encipher</I> the message, which means I scramble
it up in a hopelessly complicated way, rendering it unreadable to
anyone except you, the intended recipient of the message.  I supply a
cryptographic <I>key</I> to encrypt the message, and you have to use
the same key to decipher or <I>decrypt</I> it.  At least that's how it
works in conventional <I>single-key</I> cryptosystems.
<P>In conventional cryptosystems, such as the US Federal Data Encryption
Standard (DES), a single key is used for both encryption and
decryption.  This means that a key must be initially transmitted via
secure channels so that both parties can know it before encrypted
messages can be sent over insecure channels.  This may be
inconvenient.  If you have a secure channel for exchanging keys, then
why do you need cryptography in the first place?
<P>In public key cryptosystems, everyone has two related complementary
keys, a publicly revealed key and a secret key (also frequently called
a private key).  Each key unlocks the code that the other key makes. 
Knowing the public key does not help you deduce the corresponding
secret key.  The public key can be published and widely disseminated
across a communications network.  This protocol provides privacy
without the need for the same kind of secure channels that a
conventional cryptosystem requires.
<P>Anyone can use a recipient's public key to encrypt a message to that
person, and that recipient uses her own corresponding secret key to
decrypt that message.  No one but the recipient can decrypt it,
because no one else has access to that secret key.  Not even the
person who encrypted the message can decrypt it.  
<P>Message authentication is also provided.  The sender's own secret key
can be used to encrypt a message, thereby <I>signing</I> it.  This
creates a digital signature of a message, which the recipient (or
anyone else) can check by using the sender's public key to decrypt it.
This proves that the sender was the true originator of the message,
and that the message has not been subsequently altered by anyone else,
because the sender alone possesses the secret key that made that
signature.  Forgery of a signed message is infeasible, and the sender
cannot later disavow his signature.
<P>These two processes can be combined to provide both privacy and
authentication by first signing a message with your own secret key,
then encrypting the signed message with the recipient's public key. 
The recipient reverses these steps by first decrypting the message
with her own secret key, then checking the enclosed signature with
your public key.  These steps are done automatically by the
recipient's software.
<P>Because the public key encryption algorithm is much slower than
conventional single-key encryption, encryption is better accomplished
by using a high-quality fast conventional single-key encryption
algorithm to encipher the message.  This original unenciphered message
is called <I>plaintext</I>.  In a process invisible to the user, a
temporary random key, created just for this one <I>session</I>, is used
to conventionally encipher the plaintext file.  Then the recipient's
public key is used to encipher this temporary random conventional key.
This public-key-enciphered conventional <I>session</I> key is sent
along with the enciphered text (called <I>ciphertext</I>) to the
recipient.  The recipient uses her own secret key to recover this
temporary session key, and then uses that key to run the fast
conventional single-key algorithm to decipher the large ciphertext
message.
<P>Public keys are kept in individual <I>key certificates</I> that
include the key owner's user ID (which is that person's name), a
timestamp of when the key pair was generated, and the actual key
material.  Public key certificates contain the public key material,
while secret key certificates contain the secret key material.  Each
secret key is also encrypted with its own password, in case it gets
stolen.  A key file, or <I>key ring</I> contains one or more of these
key certificates.  Public key rings contain public key certificates,
and secret key rings contain secret key certificates.
<P>The keys are also internally referenced by a <I>key ID</I>, which is an
<I>abbreviation</I> of the public key (the least significant 64 bits
of the large public key).  When this key ID is displayed, only the
lower 32 bits are shown for further brevity.  While many keys may
share the same user ID, for all practical purposes no two keys share
the same key ID.
<P>PGP uses <I>message digests</I> to form signatures.  A message digest
is a 128-bit cryptographically strong one-way hash function of the
message.  It is somewhat analogous to a <I>checksum</I> or CRC error
checking code, in that it compactly <I>represents</I> the message and
is used to detect changes in the message.  Unlike a CRC, however, it
is computationally infeasible for an attacker to devise a substitute
message that would produce an identical message digest.  The message
digest gets encrypted by the secret key to form a signature.
<P>Documents are signed by prefixing them with signature certificates,
which contain the key ID of the key that was used to sign it, a
secret-key-signed message digest of the document, and a timestamp of
when the signature was made.  The key ID is used by the receiver to
look up the sender's public key to check the signature.  The
receiver's software automatically looks up the sender's public key
and user ID in the receiver's public key ring.
<P>Encrypted files are prefixed by the key ID of the public key used to
encrypt them.  The receiver uses this key ID message prefix to look
up the secret key needed to decrypt the message.  The receiver's 
software automatically looks up the necessary secret decryption key 
in the receiver's secret key ring.
<P>These two types of key rings are the principal method of storing and
managing public and secret keys.  Rather than keep individual keys in
separate key files, they are collected in key rings to facilitate the
automatic lookup of keys either by key ID or by user ID.
Each user keeps his own pair of key rings.  An individual public key
is temporarily kept in a separate file long enough to send to your
friend who will then add it to her key ring.

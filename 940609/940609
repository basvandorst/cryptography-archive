Subject: RIPEM cert chain question


I'm working on the RIPEM chaining code and have the following
question:

Suppose I trust a third party indirectly through you.  That is, you
have made a certificate for the third party and I have made a
certificate for you.  Now suppose you have recently changed your
address and you had made the certiicate for the third party before the
change, but I have certified you with your new address.  The chain
would have two certificates:

<Issuer = me, subject = you with your new address>
<Issuer = you with your old address, subject = third party>

The question is: since you had the same public key before and after
the address change, should the chain still work even though your
distinguished names in each one don't exactly match?  In other words,
shouldn't I trust the third party since you made a certificate for
them with a private key whose public key that I trust?  Should the
name matching be enforced, especially when people may have various
distinguished names for the one public key?

Jeff,

You are proposing that cert chaining be done by public keys rather than DNs???

How would you logistically accomplish this since a certificate only has
an issuer DN and not an issuer pubkeyinfo?  (I think my recollection
is correct.)

There are many reasons one can change one's address. Some of them involve
the loss of privileges and representational authority (say one got fired).
Thus the safest is to associate certificates with distinguished names, both
for the signer and the recipient of such certificates.

There are obviously some cases where this will cause complications, but
better safe than sorry.

RANDKEY.DOC -- DOCUMENTATION FOR RANDKEY.EXE VERSION 2.00


This program extracts random bytes from the content and timing
of your keystrokes.  This is used to generate a combination of
pure random and pseudorandom bytes.  This is useful for certain
testing applications, and has possible applications for
cryptographic key generation.


HOW TO USE RANDKEY.EXE

Syntax:
RANDKEY outname size
  Output file must not already exist.
  Size is a decimal number from 1 to 2147483647.

RANDKEY is a simple command line utility that takes two
arguments.  The first one is the name of the new file you want
to create.  The second one is the size of the file you want to
create, in bytes.  Once you start RANDKEY, you must enter random
keystrokes -- random both in timing and content -- until the
entire file is written.


HOW RANDKEY.EXE WORKS

RANDKEY initializes a cryptographic pseudorandom number
generator with the date, time, and free space on your current
disk drive.  It then feeds the value of both the keystroke and
a high resolution timer into that random number generator every
time you press a key, and writes the output to a file.  After
40 keystrokes, the process "gets impatient" and feeds the least
significant byte of the BIOS tick timer into the random number
generator if there is no keystroke waiting, thus allowing larger
quantities of bytes to be produced without wearing your fingers
out.  The bytes after the first 40 are technically not purely
random, but about 98% pseudorandom.  The 2% of randomness comes
from the fact that the speed of your CPU and the real time clock
drift some relative to each other in a way that is different
from other computers running the same program.

The cryptographic pseudorandom number generator used is the
Sapphire II Stream Cipher (as documented in ATBASH2.ZIP).  It
was designed such that even one bit difference in input produces
a radically different sequence of output bits from that point
on, in a way that is very difficult to predict.  The result is
that with "normal" random keystroke entry, the output file will
be a collection of short pseudorandom sequences, changed
randomly with each keystroke.  The result is likely to be
indistinguishable from a file of truly random bytes, unless
someone comes up with an analysis method I didn't anticipate.  If
you are interested only in pure random numbers, just use the
first 40 bytes of the file.

RANDKEY is designed such that it is nearly impossible for you to
generate the exact same sequence of bytes twice, even if you try
real hard to.  Even so, if you want to have really random
numbers output, the keystrokes you provide must be really
random.


7 USES FOR TRULY RANDOM NUMBERS

1.  Testing of hardware.
2.  Testing of software (especially compression functions).
3.  Improving the unpredictability of game software.
4.  Generating cryptographic keys of various sorts.
5.  Giving cryptanalysts and spies something to waste time on.
6.  Picking Lotto numbers (so you can waste money efficiently).
7.  Impress your friends (one way or the other...).

Note that I don't necessarily endorse any or all of the above
mentioned uses.

CPPNEWS $Revision: 1.36 $

This is cppnews, a replacement for snews and pcelm. It is written in C++
(hence the cpp). It is an SAA compliant DOS text program, with full mouse
control, dialog boxes, buttons, bar menus etc. 

This is mainly a bug fix release. Cppbatch has been enhanced to allow
article headers only to be downloaded, and then individual articles to be 
got and added to the newsbase. To do this, use the "-d" option to cppbatch
when adding the full articles. NOTE THE EXISTING ARGUMENTS TO CPPBATCH HAVE
CHANGED.

Version 1.34 saw the addition of the ability to edit outgoing messages, 
and the ability to add user defined external commands to the Article menu.
This latter enables automatic uudecoding, pgp decrypting etc. to be 
integrated with cppnews.  It also makes it easy to add a menu option which 
will use LIST (or whatever) to read articles too long for cppnews. See
"Adding external programs to the cppnews Article menu" in cppnews.doc.

Version 1.30 introduced a new newsgroup indexing system, and new 
manipulation programs for adding new news and groups to these files, and 
for removing news and groups. These replace the SNEWS expire, addgroup, 
rmgroup and unbatch programs that were used previously. There is a 
conversion program supplied (see note below).

In order to allow both SNEWS and CPPNEWS to be supported on the same 
system, there is an option to maintain both kinds of index files if 
required.

The latest version of cppnews should be available for public ftp from
ftp.demon.co.uk [158.152.1.65]:in directory /pub/trumphurst/cppnews.

Cppnews was written using my C++ text mode user interface toolkit,
which I hope to make available for public ftp in the near future.

*** PROGRAMS SUPPLIED ***

cppnews  - The actual news reading program. Interactive.
cppsetup - Interactive setup and customisation. Also used to add and 
           remove newsgroups. Batch mode available for adding and 
           removing groups - see cppnews.doc.
cppbatch - Non-interactive program to unbatch the news into cppnews 
           format. No parameters needed.
cppexpir - Non-interactive program to remove old news. Run with no
           parameters for brief usage details, or see cppnews.doc.
cppconv  - Convert SNEWS (or old cppnews) newsbase to new format.

*** ADDITIONAL PROGRAM AVAILABLE ***

cppindex - Program to re-create news indexes if they get corrupted.
           For emergency use only. Please report all corruptions
           to cppnews@trmphrst.demon.co.uk.

*** NEW USERS ***

First read CPPNEWS.DOC for details of the CPPNEWS.INI file layout, and 
environment variables required by cppnews.

CPPNEWS does not require any additional installation to receive and post 
mail, unless you use an unusual directory structure.

FIRST BACK UP YOUR ACTIVE FILE.

Then run cppsetup to initialise your cppnews.ini file, and customise it to
suit your system.

Then run cppsetup again, to add the groups in which you are interested to 
the cppnews groups list.

See the on-line help (press F1) for more details.

Demon users using the standard setup created with DIS MUST EDIT DEMON.BAT.
Details are in cppnews.doc, under "Converting from the DIS standard 
setup".

I would suggest that new users join the "demon.ip.cppnews" newsgroup 
straight away, to keep abreast of problems and new developments.

*** IMPORTANT NOTE FOR USERS OF VERSIONS 1.20 or below ***

To convert from version 1.20 or before, you need to run the conversion 
program CPPCONV.EXE. This should be run from the same directory where you 
usually run cppnews, and requires the same environment settings.

Cppconv will re-index all your existing newsgroup files. Cppconv assumes
you wish to maintain compatibility with SNEWS, so it sets the SnewsCompat 
cppnews.ini variable, and retains the SNEWS indexes. If you do not wish to
maintain snews compatibility, you can save disk space by setting the 
SnewsCompat variable to 0 in cppnews.ini, and deleting all the SNEWS 
indexes (~/newsbase/*.idx).

When you first enter this version of cppnews, all your mail files will 
also be reindexed (please be patient !). 

**** IMPORTANT **** It is possible that some or all of your mail messages
may be marked as unread during this process. It is therefore advisable
that you read ALL outstanding mail before converting. 

**** IMPORTANT **** Existing users of 1.6 or 1.7 should delete or rename
CPPNEWS.INI before running this version for the first time, otherwise you
will have a blank tool bar.

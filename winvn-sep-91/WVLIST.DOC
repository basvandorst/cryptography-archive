Notes on implementation of WinVN feature to check new groups:

/mrr   late October - early November 1990

WinVN uses the NNTP LIST command to determine whether new newsgroups
have been created.

==> NEWSRC FORMAT

newsrc format has been changed.  A Unix .newsrc consists entirely of
lines of the form:
	 group{!|:} <ranges>
WinVN newsrc files have these lines' format changed to
	 group{!|:} [s<artnum>] <ranges>

where <artnum> is the highest article number last present on the server,
whether it was seen by the user or not.
If the "s" entry is missing, the highest seen is assumed to be
the higher number in the last range present on the line.

==> APPEARANCE OF WINDOWS

The Net window contains one line for each newsgroup.  By convention,
subscribed groups are listed first, then unsubscribed groups.
Unsubscribed groups are assumed to be in alphabetical order.
Subscribed groups are not assumed to be in alphabetical
order, in order to accomodate the user's preferences.

Each line in the Net window consists of the name of the newsgroup,
preceded by an "indicator" character which gives some status information.
The indicator character is a ">" if the group name was found
in the most recent string search.  Otherwise, the character is
a "*" if new articles are present, a " " if no new articles
are present, or a "?" if we don't know (because no LIST command
was done).

Each line in a Group window consists of the Subject line of
an article, preceded by an indicator character.  The indicator
character is "s" if the article has been seen by the user,
"n" if the article is new since the last session and hasn't been
seen, or " " if the article is old and hasn't been seen.

==> METHOD OF DETERMINING NEW NEWSGROUPS

When WinVN starts up, it reads the newsrc file and stores the
information in the file in the Net document as lines in
textblocks.  WinVN then asks the user whether s/he wants
to check the server newsgroup status.

If so, WinVN issues a LIST command, locks
all the blocks in the Net document, and
allocates and builds a hash table.   The hash table contains
entries indexed by a hash function based on the newsgroup name.
Each entry contains a pointer to the line in the Net document
containing information for that group.  Collisions are handled
by the time-honored approach of choosing the next available
free entry.

WinVN also allocates space for a table, NewGroupTable, to be used to store
pointers to new newsgroups.

WinVN is now ready to process the LIST command.  What comes back is:

215 <text which can be ignored>
<groupname> <highest_art_#> <lowest_art_#> {y|n|m}
(above line format repeated for all active newsgroups)
.


WinVN ignores the 215 line, of course.  For all the groupname
lines, WinVN computes the hash function and checks to see if the
group name is in the table.  (It has to check the actual name as
well as the hash value to guard against collisions.  If a collision
occurs, it checks the next entry.)  If the entry is found,
the highest-article-on-server field is set in the group's line in the
Net document.

If the entry is not found, this is a new group.
A line containing the group's information in NetDoc format is
created and copied to dynamically-allocated memory.  A pointer to
this line is stored in NewGroupTable.

By the time the LIST's "." line is received, the Net document has 
been updated for previously-known groups, and the NewGroupTable
contains an unsorted list of the new groups, with lines in the same
format used by the Net document.  WinVN creates a window to display
this document.  The pointers in NewGroupTable are sorted so
the new groups are in alphabetical order.
WinVN then puts up a dialog box displaying the new groups and
invites the user to select the groups to subscribe to by clicking
on their names.  When the user is finished, s/he selects the "OK"
button.

WinVN then merges the "new groups" lines with the Net document.
It does so by inserting new subscribed groups just before the first
unsubscribed group in the Net document, and inserting new unsubscribed
groups just before the first unsubscribed group whose name comes after
the new group in the collating sequence.

Finally, WinVN unlocks all of NetDoc and unlocks and frees
the tables is has created in global memory.

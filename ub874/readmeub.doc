         UPDATE REPORT for UBASIC 8.74  May 5,1994
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    New Features
    ------------
    Standard graphic commands are supported for VGA systems.

    ---------------------------------------------------------
         UPDATE REPORT for UBASIC 8.72  March 30,1994
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    Bug Fix
    -------
    The composite of sinh and cosh returned a wrong value.
    (sinh(cosh(x)) was cosh(cosh(x)), etc)
    
    Arrays declared in the direct mode had some defects.
    (Two arrays used the same place, etc)
    
    Change
    ------
    If the argument x of sinh(x) and cosh(x) is negative then
    -sinh(-x) and cosh(-x) is computed.

         UPDATE REPORT for UBASIC 8.71  January 2,1994
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    New Functions
    -------------
    The arccosine function ACOS and the arcsine function ASIN 
    were added.
    
    TIME1000 gives the current time by milli-seconds.

    ---------------------------------------------------------
         UPDATE REPORT for UBASIC 8.65  October 9,1993
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    Bug Fix
    -------
    Block operation for EMA were not correct.

    New Function
    ------------
    FLOOR and CEIL were added.  FLOOR is an alias of INT.
    CEIL(x) is the smallest integer not less than x.

    Notice(changed before but not announced yet)
    ------
    IRND varies from 0 to 32767(not -32767 to 32767).
    The algorithm for RND and IRND was changed.

    Bug Fix
    -------
    EMA array did not work correctly if the size exceeded 256K.

    Change
    ------
    Display format of fractional numbers were changed:
    ex. "print 0.1" displays (old) 0.09999.... --> (new) 0.1
    Please note innner format is unchanged and 0.1 is a little
    bit smaller than the exact 0.1.

    ---------------------------------------------------------
         UPDATE REPORT for UBASIC 8.62  April 16,1993
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    Bug Fix

    Old form of 'or' and 'and' could not be used in 8.61.

    ---------------------------------------------------------
         UPDATE REPORT for UBASIC 8.61  March 20,1993
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    Bug Fix
    -------
    The command RESTORE could not apply to ASCII files.

    If a file with the extension .UBD was opened as an ASCII
    file if .UBD is specified in the OPEN statement.

    ---------------------------------------------------------
         UPDATE REPORT for UBASIC 8.6  March 5,1993
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    New Operators
    -------------
    Logical 'or' and 'and' are available in operator forms:
    ex: if (a=b) or (c=d) then ...  
    is now valid.  Until now we must write
        if or{a=b,c=d} then ...

    ---------------------------------------------------------
         UPDATE REPORT for UBASIC 8.41  October 25,1992
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    New Functions
    -------------
    Bit operation functions: bitand, bitor, bitxor, bitset,
    bitreset, bitreverse, bitcount

    ---------------------------------------------------------
         UPDATE REPORT for UBASIC 8.31  June 24,1992
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    Improvement
    -----------
    The function MODSQRT(square root modulo a prime) can treat
    big numbers now.

    ---------------------------------------------------------
         UPDATE REPORT for UBASIC 8.2e  March 29,1992
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    Improvement
    -----------
    The length of the message acceptable by INPUT was enlarged
    to 1000 characters(formally 400) when INPUT is redirected
    to a file.

    Special version
    ---------------
    UBI40*.EXE can treat integers up to 4000 digits.  I do not
    recommend them because there are many restrictions for non-
    integers.

    ---------------------------------------------------------
         UPDATE REPORT for UBASIC 8.2d  February 3,1992
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    Mistake
    -------
    For some reasons, the version number is returned to 8.2*.

    ---------------------------------------------------------
         UPDATE REPORT for UBASIC 8.30  January 24,1992
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    New Features
    ------------
    Square root modulo a prime is implemented.

    Supports SuperVGA adapter.  Various texts modes with more
    than 80*25 characters are available.

    Prime test program APRT-CL is improved. The new name is 
    APRT-CLE.

    Bug
    ---
    Memory handling routine was not suitable for DOS ver.5.
    
    ---------------------------------------------------------
         UPDATE REPORT for UBASIC 8.2A  December 2,1991
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    BIG Bug
    -------
    The power of the least nonzero fraction was incorrect.
    ex. #eps^(-1) is 0.0, of course it must be the same as
    1/#eps, which is a very large number.

    ---------------------------------------------------------
         UPDATE REPORT for UBASIC 8.28  October 4,1991
    ---------------------------------------------------------

    ---------------------------------------------------------
    New Application Programs
    ------------------------
    Professor Donald E. G. Malm sent some programs for number
    theory.  They are included in the MALM subdirectory.

    ---------------------------------------------------------
         UPDATE REPORT for UBASIC 8.27  July 17,1991
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    Bug

         UPDATE REPORT for UBASIC 8.26  June 23,1991
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    Improvement
    -----------
    Ctrl-Break becomes more sensitive.  It works well in the
    short loops such as  10 while 1:a=1:wend.

    ---------------------------------------------------------
         UPDATE REPORT for UBASIC 8.25  June 8,1991
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    BIG Bug
    -------
    Computation of polynomials modulo a prime returned incorrect
    answer when the modulus was bigger than 32768.

    Bugs
    ----
    MODPOW including MODPOW missed the sign.
    (ex. modpow(-2,modpow(2,3,5),5) was misunderstood as 
     modpow(2,modpow(2,3,5),5) )

    LOAD,APPEND,RUN with the file name assigned by a variable
    did not work well.

    SQRT of a complex number with the negative real part gave
    an answer with poor approximation.

    New features from 8.12 to 8.25
    -------------------------------
    Expanded memories are supported as optional arrays named
    EMA-array following LIM-EMS4.0. Consecutive 4 pages =
    64 KBytes are needed.
    Now EMA-arrays can be declared as local arrays in sub-
    routines and functions.
    (This function was mentioned in the documents.  But it
    cannot be used until now.)

    On-line help is supported.  See UBHELP.DOC for the usage.

    Rational arithmetic: ex. 1//2+1//3 is 5//6

    Manipulation of strings:
       Usual functions like LEFT,MID,RIGHT are available.

    1-variable Polynomial arithmetic:
       ex.  (1+_X)^2 is 1+2*_X+_X^2   use _X for the variable.

    Maximum loop time for FOR-NEXT is increasted from 2^16-1
    to 2^32-1.


    Variations of UBASIC
    --------------------

    UBIBM  for IBM-PC/AT
    UB98   for Japanese machine NEC PC-9801
    UBF    for Japanese machine FUJITSU FM-R
    UBV    for Japanese variation of IBM-AT

    There exists an 80386 version for each variation.
    This version uses 32bits multiplications and divisions.
    It runs faster if the program makes heavy use of
    multiprecision arithmetic.
    Memory area is still as same as that of the 16bits version.

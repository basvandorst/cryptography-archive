        **        UBHELP ( ver. 1.2 )        **


     UBHELP is an on-line help system for UBASIC.


1. Files in the UBHELP package and installing and removing UBHELP

     UBHELP consists of the following files:

          UBHELP.COM   program file
          UBHELP.TBL   command table file
          UBHELP.XXX   documentation for UBHELP
          UBHELP.DOC   this file
          UBH.UB       a UB-program to make UBHELP.TBL

     UBHELP is a resident program, which will remains in your
computer's memory until you remove it.  Place "UBHELP.TBL" and
"UBHELP.XXX" in the same directory, say "c:\ub\ubhelp", and type

          UBHELP /dc:\ub\ubhelp

on the DOS command line, before starting UBASIC.  After quitting
from UBASIC, type

          UBHELP /r

on the DOS comand line once again, then UBHELP will be removed
from the memory.  It may be convinient to use the batch file
consisting of following three lines:

          UBHELP /dc:\ub\ubhelp       (stay)
          UBIBM                       (execute UBASIC)
          UBHELP /r                   (remove)

(Note: When UBASIC is started by a batch file, the DOSCMD
statement will behave differently as you will expect.)

2. How to use UBHELP

     Hit  CTRL+\  in UBASIC and the help-window will be displayed.
If the character just at the cursor position is a blank, the
main menu will be appeared.  To select the item, move the
cursor to the target item and hit return.  Then the instruction
of the item will be appeared.
     If the string starting from the cursor position is a statement
or a function of UBASIC, the instruction of the item will be
appeared directly.
     Hit  CTRL+\  once again, you will find the submenu of this
help system.  We skip the details of this submenu.  You should
try to see this.

3. Revising the help texts.

     You can rewrite the help texts in "UBHELP.XXX" to get more
suitable informations.  Rewrite "UBHELP.XXX" by your text editor
and run "UBH.UB" on UBASIC.  Then the table file "UBHELP.TBL"
will be updated and you can use the new "UBHELP.XXX" from that
time.

4. Copyright and Distribution of UBHELP

     You can duplicate and distribute UBHELP freely.  And please
note that the copyright is still kept by the author.

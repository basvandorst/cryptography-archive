I'm distributing everything as .zip files now, the self-extracting
files can be a pain for someone who wants to unarchive the code
somewhere other than a DOS machine.

Sources:

WINVNSRC076B.ZIP is the latest source distribution, which includes
stuff for both Pathworks4.1/Lanman2.1a and WINSOCK.  There are two
batch files, pwk2std.bat, and std2pwk.bat, which will copy files into
a configuration where the two can be rebuilt.

As shipped, the files are set up for Pathworks/Lanman.

To rebuild for WINSOCK:

d:\> pwk2std.bat
d:\> nmake


To build for PW/LM:

d:\> nmake


Documentation:

WINVN_DOC.ZIP
WINVN_DOC_PS.ZIP

These files contain MS Word and (compressed) PS for a user manual
written by Jim Dumoulin (dumoulin@titan.ksc.nasa.gov).  (the PS file
does not contain the nasty little Ctrl-D's)



Binaries:

WINVNPWK076.ZIP is an executable for Pathworks/Lanman that expects to
find WSOCKETS.DLL.

WINVNSTD076.ZIP contains (what should be) a WINSOCK executable.  This
one calls the WSAStartup() and WSACleanup() functions, so it should
work with FTP Inc.'s WINSOCK, (Tested with Version 2.2)

WINVNNT075.ZIP contains an NT executable for the October Beta Release.
This is a 32bit app.  There are bugs in this, but it seems to be
basically useable.  You'll need to set the WINVN environment variable
(yes, it should use the registry).  To do this, go to the control
panel, pick 'System', and add a user environment variable that will
point to your NEWSRC & WINVN.INI files.  Each user should have their
own copy of both files.

WINVNNTSRC075.ZIP is the source set for building on NT.  Just type
'nmake'.  There were changes to both sources and makefiles that would
be too messy to justify having a single source release with the 16 bit
winvn.

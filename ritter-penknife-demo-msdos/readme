 Penknife for DOS


 This is the email release of the Penknife 1.0 for DOS commercial
 demo, and consists of five other files as follows:

      pendemo.uue -- demo version of Penknife, uuencoded
      pendemo.001 -- demo version of Penknife, enciphered
      pendoc.001 |
      pendoc.002 |
      pendoc.003 |-- documentation, a DOS text file, enciphered

 * PENDEMO.UUE is a UUENCODEd form of PENDEMO.EXE, the Penknife
   commercial demo program.

 * PENDEMO.001 is the same file, PENDEMO.EXE, Penknife-enciphered
   under the key "Penknife Release".  This allows the demo to be
   checked for transmission error.

 * The documentation files PENDOC.001, PENDOC.002 and PENDOC.003
   represent a single original file which was automatically broken-
   up for sending by email.  Penknife can be told to collect these
   files and decipher them into a single result file.  These files
   are also Penknife-enciphered under the key "Penknife Release".

 The Unix program "uudecode" (or some equivalent) must be used
 to recover PENDEMO.EXE, a DOS executable file.


 1.  On the Unix system, use your local uudecode:

          uudecode pendemo.uue

     This should recover PENDEMO.EXE, the DOS executable.

     (PENDEMO.EXE 1.0 has 31,552 bytes; pendemo.uue has about
     43,504 bytes.  It may be necessary to get into a text editor
     and clean up the received pendemo.uue before running uudecode;
     pay particular attention to the last uuencoded line, which
     may be short, but still necessary.)

 2.  Download PENDEMO.EXE to your PC using an error-correcting
     protocol (XMODEM, YMODEM, etc.) in binary mode.

 3.  Download the other files to your PC using an error-correcting
     protocol in text mode.  (A text-mode download should fix up the
     Unix end-of-line codes in case you want to look at the files;
     Penknife will not care.)

     (It is normally unnecessary to "clean up" the Penknife files;
     email headers and signatures are usually skipped automatically.)

 4.  Execute PENDEMO.EXE on the PC:

          pendemo

     See that the program comes up, announces itself, and opens the
     internal help system.  Do not bother continuing until it does.

 5.  Execute PENDEMO on the enciphered version of PENDEMO:

     (When uuencoding is used, it is possible that transmission
     errors may exist in the recovered file.  This possibility can
     be virtually eliminated by deciphering a Penknife-encoded
     version:  If that file deciphers with "CRC OK," the resulting
     file is free of transmission error.)

          pendemo pendemo.001 pendemo.res /d
          ^       ^           ^            ^
          |       |           |            decipher
          |    input file     output file
          |
          program to execute

     (The actual program and input filenames may vary depending on
     your email system and your download naming conventions.)

     Enter the key "Penknife Release" when asked (without quotes),
     twice.

          Note that the key "Penknife Release" contains two upper-
          case characters and one internal space.  Proper case and
          exactly one space are required.

     The program should finish in a second or so (on a 386/25), and
     announce "CRC OK."  If "BAD CRC" is announced, either the key
     was entered incorrectly, or one of the files (pendemo.uue or
     pendemo.001) was damaged in transit.  (It might be useful to
     look at the files with a text editor.)

     If the result is "CRC OK", use the new file instead of the old
     one:  Rename the first PENDEMO.EXE to PENDEMO.OLD, and then
     rename the new PENDEMO.RES to PENDEMO.EXE.  You now have a
     error-checked copy of PENDEMO.EXE.

 6.  Execute PENDEMO on the other files:

          pendemo pendoc.001+pendoc.002+pendoc.003 pendoc.txt /d
          ^       ^         ^         ^               ^        ^
          |       |        append     |               |      decipher
          |   input file1             |         output file
          |                      input file 2
          program to execute

     (Again, the actual input filenames may vary depending on your
     email system and your download naming conventions.)

     There can be no spaces around the "+" append operator.

     Again, enter the key "Penknife Release" when asked, twice.

 7.  If you have problems, describe them in detail and let me know.

# Edit the line above to reflect the location of Perl on your system.
# After editing this file to change the configuration you must run
# make install.

# Environment variables (specified using $ENV{'foo'}) are substituted
# at runtime (or install-time if that's when they're used).
#
# Pathnames for commands may come in two flavours: $config_x_... is
# passed to execlp when the program is to be called, and may thus be
# absolute or be searched for in $PATH - note that if you want to
# install the programs outside your path this will _have_ to be an
# absolute filename; $config_i_... is the place to install the program
# and should be absolute.
#
# Variables $config_l_... are not referenced directly by the
# configured scripts but are used to supply/build sensible values for
# other variables.

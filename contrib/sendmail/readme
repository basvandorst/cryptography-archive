This package consists of three perl scripts which make it easier to
send and receive PGP encrypted mail.

 o  PGPpage

    Makes your favorite pager (more, less, pg, etc.) PGP-aware.
    Can be used to read encrypted files on-the-fly, or with your
    mail reader, to read private mail.
    
 o  PGPmail

    Mail readers can use this script as the standard mail delivery
    utility. It will automatically sign and encrypt outgoing mail
    before sending it. Multiple recipients are supported.

 o  PGPedit
    
    Decrypts encrypted text before editing with your editor of choice. 
    USENET-style quotes are retained, making replies to encrypted mail 
    simple and easy.


INSTALLING

 1. These utilities are written in perl, so make sure that it is 
    available on your system. The first line of the scripts should 
    contain the full pathname for perl.

 2. The scripts should be placed somewhere in your path.

 3. PGPmail assumes that your system uses sendmail, or something that 
    works like it. (If you have something different, let me know
    and I'll see what I can do. Better yet, do it yourself and send
    me a copy of your changes for inclusion here.)

 4. Each of the scripts assumes a default location for the programs
    they replace. (/usr/ucb/vi, /usr/ucb/more, /usr/lib/sendmail)
    If they are in different locations on your system, you will need
    to make change this in the script. ($VISUAL and $PAGER are checked,
    so you can use any non-default editor or pager without changing
    the scripts.)

 4. PGP is necessary, of course.

The following are the programs I've coerced into working with these
utilities, along with how it was done.

mail (Berkeley mail, mailx)

    This is probably THE easiest program to make PGP-capable. Add
    the following lines to your .mailrc file:

        set VISUAL='pgpedit'
        set PAGER='pgppage'
        set crt=1
        set sendwait
        set sendmail='pgpmail'

    and that's it...

tin (A newsreader. Tested with 1.1 PL9.)

    Also very easy, but doesn't do as much. Set the environment variable
    MAILER to 'pgpmail' in your shell's rc file.

ELM (version 2.4 PL21)

    Set the following lines in your elmrc.

        editor = pgpedit
        visual = pgppage

    Unfortunately, Elm lacks the sendmail and sendwait variables.
    To solve the first problem, you'll need to rerun Configure and 
    supply it with the location and name of PGPmail instead of sendmail. 
    To solve the second, the ampersand on line 585 of mailmsg2.c must
    be removed, and Raw(OFF) and Raw(ON) statements inserted before
    and after the following system_call().

    Then, recompile... Hopefully, future versions of Elm will have
    sendmail and sendwait variables. In the meantime, I still recommend
    it because it's so -nice- once you get it working with PGPmail.

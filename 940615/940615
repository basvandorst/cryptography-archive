Subject: CRLs and ID by public key


The point that CRLs are tied to distinguished name is a very good one.
It seems that the going certification methods seem to rely mostly on
distinguished name and these need to be kept in the picture.  I had
been thinking about smart cards, for example, which might not even
have a name in them, just a keypair.  And it is the key which is
cryptographically significant.  But the certificate, CRL and other
bookkeeping end of things seem to require a name always be tied to a
keypair.  I will enforce this in the chaining code and extended trust
lists.  Does this seem OK, Mark?

David, this is very condescending language, extremely unprofessional,
and quite tiresome.  If you meant it lightheartedly, that's not how it
came across to me.

OK, I think we are in 100% agreement that we need to rely upon
DN's.  I withdraw my support for identification by public key.

Issue closed (I think).

I think such material does not belong in the list, but in e-mail where I
have taken it. I write to indicate that, and forestall a discussion of
personal character or style which has no place in a technical discussion
list.

I agree that I should not have posted my reaction to David to the whole
list.  I apologize for not taking the issue off line.

WHAT COMPATIBILITY ISSUES EXIST BETWEEN PGP 5.0 AND EARLIER VERSIONS

PGP 5.0 introduces some new algorithms for both public key and conventional
encryption. These changes are good from both technical (security &
efficiency) and political (patent) standpoints. With the death of the
Diffie-Hellman key exchange patent, the freeware PGP new algorithms are 100%
free of patent problems, and free of legaleze such as come with the RSAREF
toolkit. The Diffie-Hellman key exchange key size limit is also larger than
the old RSA limit, so PGP encryption is actually more secure, now. The new
SHA1 hash function is better than MD5, so signatures are more secure, now,
too. The conventional encryption used is all sound, and definitely not the
weak link in the chain. This much is good news.

The bad news, of course, is that there will be some interoperability
problems, since no earlier versions of PGP can handle these algorithms. How
this affects you depends on the PGP version that you have.

There are really 3 versions of PGP called PGP 5.0. The freeware
edition can only generate and use the new (faster, more secure,
patent-problem-free) algorithms. There is a really cheap (cheaper than one
S/MIME key certificate) upgrade to PGP 5.0 for Eudora users that will let you
use the old RSA keys as well. Then, of course, the full commercial version of
PGP 5.0 can handle both old and new algorithms and message formats equally
well. If you want to handle both, you need to either keep both an old and new
freeware PGP around, upgrade to one of the versions of PGP 5.0 that can
handle the old keys.

IS PGP LEGAL?

Pretty Good Privacy is legal if you follow these rules:

Don't export PGP from the USA except to Canada, or from Canada except to the
USA, without a license (except that printed books containing source code are
OK to export).
If you are in the USA, use either Viacrypt PGP (licensed for commercial use)
or MIT PGP using RSAREF (limited to personal, noncommercial use). Outside of
the USA, where RSA is not patented, you may prefer to use a version of PGP
(2.6.3i) that doesn't use RSAREF to avoid the restrictions of that license.

If you are in a country where the IDEA cipher patent holds in
software (including the USA and some countries in Europe), make
sure you are licensed to use the IDEA cipher commercially before using
PGP commercially. (No separate license is required to use the freeware
PGP for personal, noncommercial use). For direct IDEA licensing, contact
Ascom Systec:

Erhard Widmer,  Ascom Systec AG, Dep't. CMVV      Phone  +41 64 56 59 83
Peter Hartmann, Ascom Systec AG, Dep't. CMN       Phone  +41 64 56 59 45
Fax:            +41 64 56 59 90
e-mail:         IDEA@ascom.ch
Mail address:   Gewerbepark, CH-5506 Maegenwil (Switzerland)

Viacrypt has an exclusive marketing agreement for commercial
distribution of Philip Zimmermann's copyrighted code. (Selling
shareware/freeware disks or connect time is OK). This restriction does
not apply to PGP 3.0, since it is a complete rewrite by Colin Plumb.

If you modify PGP (other than porting it to another platform, fixing a bug,
or adapting it to another compiler), don't call it PGP (TM) or Pretty Good
Privacy (TM) without Philip Zimmermann's permission.
IMPORTANT:
Please note that there is an official distribution site for MIT
PGP and another for the International version:
WorldWideWeb references:
U.S/Canada non-commercial use: http://web.mit.edu/network/pgp-form.html
Norway/International non-commercial use: http://www.ifi.uio.no/pgp/
U.S. commercial use: http://www.pgp.com

WHAT IS PHILIP ZIMMERMANN'S LEGAL STATUS?

Philip Zimmermann was under investigation for alleged violation of export
regulations, with a grand jury hearing evidence for about 28 months, ending
11 January 1996. The Federal Government chose not to comment on why it
decided to not prosecute, nor is it likely to.  The Commerce Secretary stated
that he would seek relaxed export controls for cryptographic products, since
studies show that U. S. industry is being harmed by current regulations.
Philip endured some serious threats to his livelihood and freedom, as well as
some very real legal expenses, for the sake of your right to electronic
privacy.
The battle is won, but the war is not over. The regulations that
caused him so much grief and which continue to dampen cryptographic
development, harm U. S. industry, and do violence to the U. S. National
Security by eroding the First Ammendment of the U. S. Constitution and
encouraging migration of cryptographic industry outside of the U. S. A. are
still on the books.
If you are a U. S. Citizen, please write to your U. S. Senators, Congressional Representative, President, and Vice President
pleading for a more sane and fair cryptographic policy.
Several legislative efforts will if successful relax the export controls
of cryptographic software from the U.S.
See:
 http://www.epic.org
 http://www.crypto.com

CAN I USE ENCRYPTION LEGALY?

Within the U.S. there is no legal obstacle for use of strong
encryption.
In an ideal world everyone would have the right to use encryption.
Unfortunately, your right to use encryption may be restricted
or does not exist.
In France, the goverment prohibits the use of encryption without prior
permission, that you won't get if you are a private citizen.
Germany is said to consider banning the use
and distribution of strong cryptographic software in the name of "national security."
United Kingdom may adopt a key escrow system.

WHAT OTHER FILE ENCRYPTION (DOS, MAC) TOOLS ARE THERE?

PGP can do conventional encryption only of a file (-c) option, but
you might want to investigate some of the other alternatives if you do
this a lot.
Alternatives include Quicrypt and Atbash2 for DOS, DLOCK for
DOS & UNIX, Curve Encrypt (for the Mac), HPACK (many platforms), and a
few others.
Quicrypt is interesting in that it comes in two flavors:  shareware
exportable and registered secure. Atbash2 is interesting in that it generates
ciphertext that can be read over the telephone or sent by Morse code. DLOCK
is a no-frills strong encryption program with complete source code. Curve
Encrypt has certain user-friendliness advantages. HPACK is an archiver (like
ZIP or ARC), but with strong encryption. A couple of starting points for your
search are:

HOW DO I SECURELY DELETE FILES (DOS)?

If you have the Norton Utilities, Norton WipeInfo is pretty good. I
use DELETE.EXE in del110.zip, which is really good at deleting existing
files, but doesn't wipe "unused" space.

WHAT DO I DO ABOUT THE PASS PHRASE IN MY WINDOWS SWAP FILE?

The nature of Windows is that it can swap any memory to disk at any
time, meaning that all kinds of interesting things could end up in your
swap file.

WHERE DO I GET PGPfone(tm)?

PGPfone is in beta test for Macintosh and Windows'9 users.
The MIT has shut down their ftp distribution of PGPfone <tm> for
Macintosh and Windows'95, so within the U.S/Canada you must obtain
PGPfone <tm> using a WorldWideWeb browser.

WHERE DO I GET NAUTILUS?

Bill Dorsey, Pat Mullarky, and Paul Rubin have come out with a
program called Nautilus that enables you to engage in secure voice
conversations between people with multimedia PCs and modems capable of
at least 7200 bps (but 14.4 kbps is better). See:

HOW DO I ENCRYPT MY DISK ON-THE-FLY?

Secure File System (SFS) is a DOS device driver that encrypts an entire
partition on the fly using SHA in feedback mode.

Secure Drive also encrypts an entire DOS partition, using IDEA, which is
patented.

Secure Device is a DOS device driver that encrypts a virtual, file-hosted
volume with IDEA.

Cryptographic File System (CFS) is a Unix device driver that uses DES.
CryptDisk is a ShareWare package for Macintosh that uses strong IDEA
encryption like PGP.

ftp://basement.replay.com/pub/replay/pub/disk/

WHERE IS PGP'S COMPETITION?

S/MIME is gaining a foothold on the secure email market, but my experience
with it has been rather negative. Current implementations of S/MIME (1) don't
allow secure key lengths to be used except in "U. S. Only" versions, (2)
require payment of an annual fee to a key certification authority who
verifies only that you got email to your key certificate's address at least
once, (3) have much more limited key management facilities than PGP, and (4)
the first time I tried to make S/MIME work, it flat out failed to perform as
advertised. On the positive side, S/MIME is integrated into email packages
almost as well as PGP is integrated into Eudora, and once the kinks are taken
out, the secure version of S/MIME (1024-bit RSA keys and 128-bit RC-2 keys)
will be good enough for most people. The "export" edition (512-bit RSA keys
and 40-bit RC-2 keys) is a very bad idea, because it gives a false sense of
security.

RIPEM is the third most popular freeware email encryption package.  I like
PGP better for lots of reasons, but if for some reason you want to check or
generate a PEM signature, RIPEM is available at ripem.msu.edu. There is also
an exportable RIPEM/SIG.

HOW DO I PUBLISH MY PGP PUBLIC KEY?

Send mail to one of these addresses with the single word "help" in the
subject line to find out how to use them. These servers sychronize keys with
each other.
There are other key servers, too.
pgp-public-keys@keys.pgp.net

HOW DO I RETRIEVE A PGP PUBLIC KEY(S)  USING A WWW BROWSER?

http://www.pgp.net/pgpnet/www-key.html

CAN I SUBMIT MY PUBLIC KEY TO A "CLEAN" CERTIFIED DATABASE?

For US $20/year or so, you can have your key officially certified and
published in a "clean" key database that is much less susceptible to
denial-of-service attacks than the other key servers. Send mail to
info-pgp@Four11.com for information, or look at http://www.Four11.com/

Of course, you can always send your key directly to the parties you wish to

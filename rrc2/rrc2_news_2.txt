Hello,

I have implemented the RRC.2 cipher and want to make it available to anybody
interested. I have now completed a second revision of the C version, and
finished an (MS-Dos Turbo) Pascal version. 


The (ANSI-) C version was tested under i386-Linux and comes in a .tar.gz
archive. It should now be endian neutral. Unfortunately I only have an x86
machine, so I have not been able to verify the endian-adjustment works
correctly. The archive contains the spec, a readme with a few explanations,
and the code (including a very simple sample crypto program).

The (Turbo) Pascal version is a .zip archive and contains only the
encryption routines and a simple program to verify correct implementation.


Several friendly persons have offered to put the code on their servers. I am
pleased to announce that the code is now available via the ftp protocol, so
it may be downloaded anonymously (and without human intervention :-). Please
feel free to download from:

ftp://ftp.hacktic.nl/pub/replay/pub/crypto/LIBS/rrc2.tar.gz

That is still the first version, but I'll hurry to send an up-to-date copy.
(I'll try to keep track of other servers, if I can.)


I'd like to emphasize that the code was written entirely from the spec 
posted by Peter Gutmann. I have never seen code of any RSA cipher, 
including "RC2". I am living, working and programming in the Federal 
Repulic of Germany, which is neither a part of the United States of 
America nor subject to the latter's legislation or jurisdiction.


I wish you all the best,

Daniel Vogelheim

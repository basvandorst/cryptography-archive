Hi,

I have implemented the RRC.2 cipher and want to make it available to anybody 
interested. Since I am new to cryptography the code probably isn't of high 
quality by professional measures, though. (I plan to improve it as I learn.)

I have an i386-Linux version coded in C. (An MS-DOS Turbo Pascal variant 
will be available soon.) I do not want to post it in this newsgroup since 
the code & docs are 10KB in size. I'll gladly e-mail it to anybody; just 
drop me a line.

I'd appreciate VERY MUCH if anybody could put the code up on their WWW or 
ftp server.

It is a .tar.gz archive, and it contains the spec, a readme with a few 
explanations, and the code (including a very simple crypto program).

I'd like to emphasize that the code was written entirely from the spec 
posted by Peter Gutmann. I have never seen code of any RSA cipher, 
including "RC2". I am living, working and programming in the Federal 
Repulic of Germany, which is neither a part of the United States of 
America nor subject to the latter's legislation or jurisdiction.

I wish you all the best,

Daniel Vogelheim

Chapter 1. PGP general.

PGP is Pretty Good Privacy from Phil Zimmermann. It is currently the
best available encryption available to civilians at large.
Zimmermann is the programmer on the original PGP versions but now,
apparently, just guides other programmers in making improved versions.
PGP uses two encryption algorithms: RSA for its Public Key powers &
IDEA for its bulk encryption. The advantages of PGP over other
crypt/decrypt systems are:
1. RSA algorithm. Allows users to communicate without needing a secure
channel to exchange keys. - PUBLIC KEY ENCRYPTION.
2. The program system has been very well done & has huge development
support.
3. It has huge popularity.
4. Security is guaranteed with distribution of source code & public
investigation.
5. Its free.
6. Both RSA & IDEA are "STRONG" algorithms.



Section 2: Michael Johnson's PGP FAQ contribution

Michael Paul Johnson <mpj@netcom.com> has an excellent faq on
Subject: Where to Get the Latest PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) FAQ
/* (Last modified: 31 October 1994 by Mike Johnson) */

 You can get this faq by anonymous ftp to:
ftp.csn.net /mpj/getpgp.asc

It is also posted monthly on alt.security.pgp

   The latest versions of PGP are VIACRYPT PGP 2.7 , MIT PGP 2.6.2
& PGP 2.6ui & the new PGP 2.6.i . Which is best? I would say
MIT PGP 2.6.2 although PGP 2.6.i is a close contender. MIT's has
source code, Phil Zimmerman's blessing & is US legal. For a further
discussion of variations, consult Michael Johnson's FAQ.

Section 3. Stealth PGP                                                   37

   Stealth PGP refers to a PGP file that does not have the
RSA prefix tag on the beginning of a PGP encrypted file or to PGP
utility software that disguises this tag. Possibly, a later version
of PGP with have this as an option.

   The advantages of "Stealthy" PGP are that its files  cannot be found
by Internet search programs that hunt for the PGP/RSA tag & that a
"Stealthy" file may be more securely hidden by a good steganography
program.

From: Mark Grant <mark@unicorn.com>
Subject: Stealth PGP

Responding to my question "Has Stealth PGP been done yet?"
Mark Grant says:

Kind of, there's a 'stealth' filter available that strips and attaches
headers to PGP messages after encryption. It's available from various
places, and the documentation is available on my 'other people's PGP
addons' WWW page :

        http://www.c2.org/~mark/pgp/other.html

There's also information about Privtool, my PGP-aware mail program for
Sun workstations at :

Steganography is the craft of hiding messages in pictures. The text is,
of course, encrypted text rather than plain text.


The current best steganography program has been done by Arsen Arachelian
Below, follows his text contribution:


From: rarachel@prism.poly.edu (Arsen Ray Arachelian)

WNSTORM is available from:
ftp.wimsey.bc.ca:/pub/crypto/software/dist/US_or_Canada_only_XXXXXXX/Steg

Usual routine to get it. i.e. cd /pub/crypto/software, get the README
file, and if you agree to the terms then follow the instructions.

Short description off the top of my head (I wrote the beastie)  Another
info scrap should be in the same directory as WNSTORM.


WNSTORM is a data encryption/steganography utility which is pretty secure for
most uses.  Unlike some stego systems WNSTORM is expandible, all you have to
do is write your own LSB injector/extractor for whatever data format you wish
to hide information into.

WNSTORM doesn't require the recipient of the host picture, sound, movie, etc.
to have the original un-stormed picture.  Unlike primitive stego programs,
WNSTORM doesn't compare an stormed picture with an unstormed picture.

WNSTORM will cover its tracks statistically.  If it changes a 0 bit in the
LSB data stream to a zero, or a 1 bit to a 1, it does nothing.  If it changes
a 1 bit to a zero, it will balance itself by changing an unused adjacent 0
bit to a 1.  Ditto for a 0->1 transform.

WNSTORM will NOT change every bit of the LSB in order to prevent detection.
It will use a passkey along with a probabilistic algorithm to decide which
bits it will change.  The algorithm for picking bits depends on the previous
succesfully encoded/decoded cyphertext AND the passkey.

Internally WNSTORM works by picking "windows" or "packets" of bytes out of
either a random number stream or an LSB stream extracted from a picture,
sound, movie, etc.  It then injects eight bits of cyphertext into this window.
Each window is of variable size.  The bit locations where the bits are inserted
are randomly exchanged for each pass.  The bit values are also randomly
exchanged for each pass.

WNSTORM includes an injector/extractor for PCX images, however I will write
more injecotr/extractor programs for it in the future, and OTHERS can do so
as well.

Announcing PGP WinFront 3.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A freeware Windows front end for PGP 2.3a and 2.6
Copyright 1994 Ross Barclay (rbarclay@trentu.ca)

WHAT IT IS:

        - PGP WinFront is the most fully featured free (or
        otherwise) Windows front end available. It will make
        using PGP easy for beginners, and it will drastically
        increase the speed at which experts use it too.

        PGP WinFront is now into is third revision and I have
        tried to implement as many of the suggestions that I
        received as possible. PGP WinFront was designed by
        its users, but was coded by me.

        Features:

        - Supports secret key ring placement on floppy drive
        - Support en/decryption to/from clipboard
        - Move / Copy / Delete files
        - Online hypertext help
        - Online hypertext PGP help
        - Keyring reader to pick names, view key characteristics
        - Keyring reader supports less-often used "huge" keyrings
        - Signature Checker
        - Very configurable - over 25 user-definable settings
        - more . . .

        This program does too much to list here. And it's free!

        This version is a complete rewrite of the popular
        PGP WinFront 2.0. The feature-set has largely been
        set by users who sent in suggestions.

        Please read the file README.TXT and peruse the help
        files. Please send me your comments.

HOW TO GET IT:

        At the moment, there are 2 ways to get this program:

        1) Via FTP

        - The PGP WinFront 3.0 filename is called PWF30.ZIP.

        - It has been uploaded to the incoming directories of
        the following FTP sites:

                ftp.cica.indiana.edu
                ftp.eff.org
                ftp.wimsey.bc.ca
/* from Gary Jeffers. There has been a problem getting pwf30 from these
sites. However, it CAN ACTUALLY be ftp'ed with the following info.:



ftp.wimsey.bc.ca:
/pub/crypto/software/dist/US_or_Canada_only_XXXXXXXX/PGP/Misc/pwf30.zip

                ftp.ee.und.ac.za
                ftp.demon.co.uk

        - Hopefully, they will be slotted into the PGP directories
        soon. On CICA, it will be placed into \pub\pc\win3\utils.
        That is where PWF20.ZIP was placed.

        - Once you get the program, please upload it to other
        FTP sites!

        2) From Colorado Catacombs BBS

        - dial (303)772-1062. The file is called PWF30.ZIP

        - once you get the program, please upload it to other
        BBSs.

        *** The mail access system I had was discontinued. This is
        because the file was too big to fit into my account.
        However, you can still register PWF and request certain
        PGP and PWF related items using my mail access system.
        Details of these are on the "About" screen of PWF 30.

   So, what are they about? They are about VIRUSES! They don't just
carry a couple of virus things - they are the VIRUSES-ARE-US of the
virus world! They have a journal: Computer Virus Developments Quarterly.
They have books on viruses, virus protection, cryptanalysis, the science
fiction book "Heiland", a CD-ROM for $99.95 of several thousand live
viruses, disks of viruses with source code, executable & utilities,
programs & cards for boot protection, & even a virus IDEA computer
system protector.

   Copy follows for two items of particular interest to Cypherpunks:

POTASSIUM HYDROXIDE, KOH
 By the "King of Hearts"
   A sophisticated piece of software which uses ideas first developed by
computer virus writers to secure your computer system against those who
would like to get their hands on the information in it. You give KOH a
pass phrase, & it uses state of the art IDEA data encryption algorithm
to encrypt all of the information on your hard disk & your floppies. It
is, for all intents & purposes, unbreakable, & works well with DOS &
Windows. Many encryption programs offered commercially are easily
cracked, but this one is not.
   Some people call this program a virus, come say it is not. In ways,
it acts like a virus to do some of your security housekeeping for you.
Yet at worst it is a friendly virus that lets you choose when & how
it will replicate.
   program & manual on disk, $10
program, full source, & manual on disk, $20
(Overseas customers add $12: KOH cannot be exported from the US, but
since it was not developed in the US, we will forward your order to the
overseas distributor. Please allow 6 weeks for delivery)


HEILAND
By Franklin Sanders
276 pages, Paperback, 1986

   Here's an entertaining book about America in the year 2020. If you
wonder if it's proper to use viruses in wartime or if such a virus could
be termed "good", this book will give you some food for thought. Sanders
makes use of computer "worms" when the oppressed people of the US attack
the federal government in an all-out war against tyranny. Sanders uses
his worms right too - not as some all-powerful monster. Rather, they are
deployed as part of a larger military strategy. For a book written in
1986, that's not bad!
   And if you're fed up with the government, this book is sure to give
you a vision for the future. Sanders has been part of the mounting tax
protest in this country. He's fought the IRS in court for years & won
some important battles. Unfortunately the government seems to be con-
firming some of his worst suspensions about them. Now you can get a good
dose of his philosophy & his ideas about remedying our problems. And if
you work for the government, don't be offended - this book is doubly
recommended for you!
Book, $8.00

for shipping add $2 per book. 5% sales tax for AZ. residents.

   It is my belief that in the next few years more uses for viruses
than just being a vandal will be found. Also, they may find a place
in protecting our electronic freedom. - for instance virus remailers.
Also see my previous post - The FREEDOM DEAMON. Also, they have a place
in my CHATTERBOX concept(a remailer for chat mode or commands).
"Viruses aren't just for Sociopaths anymore!"
   Also, I suspect the state may start cracking down on virus tech-
nology. Incidentally, did you all know that crypt has a place in modern
viruses? Encryption is used to hide "nasty" code & virus signatures
until they get into the system & decrypt.
                                         Yours Truly,

some also support Usenet posting.  Soda is pretty typical.

- The cypherpunks remailers, which are mostly one-way no-reply mailers;
- Various enhanced cypherpunks remailers, which have features like
encrypted reply addresses you can attach at the end.

You can get information on using the soda remailer by sending email
to remailer@csua.berkeley.edu, with "help" somewhere in the posting;
I'm not sure if it wants it in the Subject: or in the body.
That's the remailer that posts from "Tommy the Tourist" with
random NSA-bait at the bottom of postings.

Here's a recent posting on getting status of remailers.
Note that some really only remail once per day, so they may be
working fine even if it says they're not.

Hi all,

   I have written and installed a remailer pinging script which
collects detailed information about remailer features and reliability.

   To use it, just finger remailer-list@kiwi.cs.berkeley.edu

   There is also a Web version of the same information, at

   Please do not take the uptime figures too seriously, at least for
another week or so. The script has only been running reliably for a
few days.

   Please let me know about any other remailers which I missed. I've
only included remailers which can mail to arbitrary addresses, so I
already know chop and twwells are missing.

   If you've got a Web page, please feel free to include a link to

Chapter 7. Current problems in Crypt.

1. We need an Internet Chat PGP system for conversations in real time.
    /* HEY! ITS LOOKS LIKE WE'VE GOT IT! SEE CHAPTER 10. */
2. Has Arsen Arachelian really solved the problem of discovery of crypt
   in steganograpy by statistical examination of the least significant
   bits in his WNSTROM? I have seen no debate on this.
3. If the Feds capture the internet & put their anti-privacy hardware
   & protocols in place & outlaw remailers, does anyone have any idea
   how to build secure & effective remailers? A "Fortress remailer"?
4. If the above possibility happens & Cyperpunks' list is outlawed,
   does anyone have ideas how to make a "Fortress list"?

   by Simson Garfinkel
   1st Edition November 1994 (est.)
   250 pages (est),ISBN: 1-56592-098-8, $17.95 (est)

     PGP is a freely available encryption program that protects the
privacy of files and electronic mail.  It uses powerful public key
cryptography and works on virtually every platform.  PGP: Pretty Good
Privacy by Simson Garfinkel is both a readable technical users guide and
a fascinating behind-the-scenes look at cryptography and privacy.  Part I
of the book describes how to use PGP:  protecting files and email,
creating and using keys, signing messages, certifying and distributing
keys, and using key servers.  Part II provides background on cryptography,
battles against public key patents and U.S. government export restrictions,
and other aspects of the ongoing public debates about privacy and free
speech.

Foreword by Philip Zimmermann

This book is about Pretty Good Privacy, a program I created to encrypt e-
mail using public key cryptography. PGP was electronically published as
free software in 1991. Little did I realize what this project would lead to.
PGP has become the worldwide de facto standard for e-mail encryption.
        I've admired Bill Stallings's writings in computer science for some
years before PGP, and here he is writing a book about my program. How
can I talk about how great his book is, without, by implication, talking
about how great PGP is? It's hard to write a foreword for his book about
PGP without sliding into some measure of self-indulgence.
        I've been so close to this project for so long that I sometimes lose
sight of the scope of what PGP provides. I got the manuscript for Bill's book
in the mail the other day -- the book you are holding. Sitting down with it,
flipping through it, endless pages of diagrams, the formal treatment of it,
services provided by PGP. It wasn't till I saw his book on PGP that I could
step back and see PGP as others see it. The breadth of it. As a software
engineer, I'm used to either documenting my own software, or having a
random company tech writer document it. All software engineers get that.
But having William Stallings do the manual for your software -- it's sort of
like having your portrait done by a world-class artist.
        There are a very small number of software packages that have far-
reaching political implications. Most software that fits in such an influential
category has negative effects on our civil liberties. For example,
government intelligence agencies use a software package called PROMIS,
which is a powerful tool of governments to track people's activities,
movements, spending, political affiliations, et cetera. Now that is a piece of
software with far-reaching political implications. Mostly bad ones. Then
there is the software that the Medical Information Bureau uses to classify
people who file medical insurance claims, to put them on a medical "black
list", so that they cannot purchase any medical insurance ever again. That
software has far-reaching political implications -- enough to raise a large-
scale backlash in our society to do something about it. In most cases, it
seems that software that has powerful political effects is software designed
to strengthen the strong and weaken the weak.
        But PGP also has far-reaching political implications. Mostly good ones.
In the Information Age, cryptography affects the power relationship
between government and its people. The Government knows this all too
well, as evidenced by their recent policy initiatives for the Clipper chip,
which would give the Government a back door into all our private
communications -- an Orwellian "wiretap chip" built into all our
telephones, fax machines and computer networks. PGP strikes a blow
against such dark trends, and has become a crystal nucleus for the growth
of the Crypto Revolution, a new political movement for privacy and civil
liberties in the Information Age.  This government has done all they can to
stop the emergence of a worldwide encryption standard that they don't
have a back door into. And that same government has placed me under
criminal investigation for unleashing this free software on the world. If
indicted and convicted, I would face 41 to 51 months in a federal prison.
        Despite the pressure the Government has brought to bear against
PGP (or perhaps because of it), PGP has become the most widely used
software in the world for e-mail encryption, used by a variety of activists,
and anyone else needing protection from the powerful. It's also used by
ordinary people to protect their personal and business communications
from prying eyes.
        PGP may have a future as an official Internet standard, as the
Internet Engineering Task Force develops an interest in it. No one who
wants to work in the area of Internet e-mail privacy should neglect
studying PGP. Because of the "fax machine effect", more people who want
to encrypt their e-mail are getting PGP because everyone else who
encrypts their e-mail is already using it.
        Naturally, I want people to read the Official PGP User's Guide, which
comes with the electronic distribution package of PGP (also in book form
from MIT Press), because I wrote it. Also, I'm more entertaining and
personable in my book. And more political. But Bill Stallings' book is more
comprehensive than mine, more thorough, covering more detail, with a lot
more diagrams. He's really good at completely nailing it down in a book. In
fact, I'll probably use his book myself as my preferred reference to PGP.

Chapter 10. IRC chat strong encryption?

Section 1. prig (cryptical)'s  contribution.


   Do we really have this capability now? According to following post we
do! This info has not been verified yet. You may want to experiment
for yourself.

Section 1. prig(cryptical)'s offering.

From: prig0011@gold.tc.umn.edu
Subject: IRC Encryption

There was a thread a while back about encrypted conversations on channel
#freedom on irc. I came across the software I believe they are using. Its
a package called Circ, and it is available from archives of
comp.sources.misc volume 38 issue 10. It is interesting in that it uses
RSA for key exchange, and triple DES for the encryption. The Circ package
includes an earlier implementation "socks" which is a stand alone
encrypted irc client. I think this is what they use on #freedom. This is
an interesting tool for a couple of reasons. irc can be as anonymous as
you want to make it. There are ways of hiding what site you're coming
from, your real username, you can change your nick often as you want, and
it's got a high enough usage that you can lose yourself in a crowd.
It supports background file transfers. You can create a channel and lock
it to uninvited people. It is supported pretty much net-wide, if you can
telnet, you can irc. Interesting stuff, and I'll be playing more with it
in the near future.

BTW: my nick is cryptical on irc. :)

/*
Section 2. Ed Carp's offer.

   According to Ed Carp, the package has been around for a long time &
he's had it on his system for monthes. Ed says: "If anyone wants it,
they can email me and I'll send it to them, tarred, gripped, and
uuencoded."

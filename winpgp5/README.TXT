This is the production release of WinPGP® 5.0 32bit shell for PGP.

WinPGP is shareware and can be evaluated for 30 days.  Previously  
registered users can update to version 5.0 for free.  However, to
eliminate the nag screens, you must get an updated registration code.

   *** IMPORTANT NOTES!!! ***
*******************************

1. WinPGP® contains none of the PGP® executables and incorporates none
of the PGP® source code in any way or form.  This program simply 
provides the user with a convenient Windows GUI interface.

2. Users of WinPGP® must accept this disclaimer of warranty: 

"WinPGP® is supplied as is.  The author disclaims all warranties, expressed or implied, 
including, without limitation, the warranties of merchantability and of fitness for any purpose.
The author assumes no liability for damages, direct or consequential, which may result from the 
use of WinPGP®."

3. Note that when WinPGP® 5.0 runs bulk decrypt, the original *.PGP files are
NOT deleted automatically.  Feedback from the user community as to whether this should
remain is desired.

4. Due to limitations in PGP itself, Long Filenames are not supported at this time.
If you attempt to run an encryption in a directory that has long pathnames, PGP will 
balk.  I.e., "C:\WinPGP 5" will not work. Also, files that are encrypted in bulk encryption
will be reduced to their MSDOS 8.3 formats.  Decrypting will not recover the original 
long filenames.

5. Note that this version is designed to run in Windows 95 and 
Windows NT 3.51 or higher.  It will NOT run properly in 
Windows 3.1 or 3.11 even if Win32s is installed.  If you are using
Windows 3.1 or 3.11, please use the 16 bit WinPGP 4.1 instead.

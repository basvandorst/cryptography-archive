	You seem to confuse rational thought with intellectual games.
	You also seem to confuse emotion with insight.

	But I AM a father.  I am also a citizen.  You could use your
	irrational, emotional arguments to justify any atrocity you wanted.
	All you have to say is: "I'm a father, certain kinds of individuals
	are dangerous to my children, therefore this constitution shit
	is for the birds.  We can't affort it.  The price in the blood
	of the innocents is too high."

	Sadly, all too many people are dangerously susceptible 
	to totally specious arguments based on emotion.  That's why
	mobs and witch hunts and mass hysterias happen.  Until people 
	can discipline themselves to avoid hysteria we are likely to be 
	troubled by dictators and despots.  The most effective of
	which know how to manipulate people who can't control their 
	emotions long enough to have a rational thought.

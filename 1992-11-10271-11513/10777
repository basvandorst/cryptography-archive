For those of you who don't get out much, Jyrki Kuoppala is one of the
most hardcore fanatical libertarians on the net.  For him to post a
SERIOUS bigoted racist etc tirade would require nothing less than a
complete brain transplant.

If you'll read his article again, you'll notice (I hope) that he's
merely parroting the excuses our government uses to rationalize their
increasing stranglehold on our personal lives.  THEY are the bigoted
racist etc pigs you should be angry at.

Get a clue, folks.

thx

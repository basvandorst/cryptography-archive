	Judging from the 2 e-mail replys I got, I'm not receiving sci.crypt
very well. In fact I got no postings, just the 2 e-mails. Thankyou to all
who took the time to make comments of any type. I'll talk to my mail source and
get a full sci.crypt feed going.

	On the second thought could someone send me the followups on my RSA et
al posting? The E-mail indicates that some of you may not think that encryption
of stored mail files is a good idea. I'm interested in hearing the pros and
cons.
                                                          
             Thanks, Ethan

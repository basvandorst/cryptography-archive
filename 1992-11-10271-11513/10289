Summary: "Assault keys" and Satire
Keywords: guns, encryption


After I posted my first response to the "Assault keys" post, I suddenly
became afraid that it was I who had missed the satire- in the vein of
Swift's "A Modest Proposal".  Taken in that light, it was acutually
rather good. However, I am relieved that if I missed the satire
so did a lot of others.

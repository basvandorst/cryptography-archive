Well, crypto arguments aside, it is my belief that you could indeed be
ordered to disclose the plaintext under the situation described above,
but it would be by court order, and certainly not at the command of some
law enforcement officer during the course of a search.  And that is how
is should be.  Your only defense from having to do so or suffer consequences
would ultimately be to plead the 5th Amendment prohibition against forced
self incrimination, although a legal appeal on other grounds would very
likely thwart the process temporarily, and with luck permanently.

With regards to crypto, I would assert that a court order requiring a
decryption would, or at least should, be similar to the above.  I would
personally buy the argument that demanding a key would have the likely effect
of permitting searches beyond the scope of an original warrant and therefore
be unwise of the court to demand, but if they did, and I exhausted the appeal
process, then I would assert one would have to produce the key if indeed
they had it in their posession.

This is fundamentally different than the proposal of Dr. Denning which
demands a key be produced for safekeeping before the fact.  I disagree
with that approach, finding it in violation of several of the precepts
in the Bill of Rights.  Incidently, I also disagree with the assertion
of Mr. Ritter that people should be charged with retaining their keys
indefinitely.  Destroying "evidence" before one has reason to believe
it is of legal value is hardly a crime, and pitching the key that decrypts
a casual email message is no more "destroying evidence" than throwing
out an old letter you have no need for any more.

 Here, here!

	The liking of cryprography to munitions is due to it's strategic
nature, that is the ability to hide your commands.

	To like cryptography to guns is to realize that they both have
constitutional support (so say I).

	But, lets not carry this likeness too far. Please remember the
functions of each.

	1) cryptography is to keep your papers and communications secure.

	2) guns are to 'reach out and touch someone'. Using force to stop
           force.


	When used guns are very intrusive, cryptography is very private.

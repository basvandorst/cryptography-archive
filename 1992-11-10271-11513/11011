Actually as of August 29, 1991, the Commodity Control List allowed GDTR letter
of assurance licensing to COCOT, Austria, Finland, Ireland, and Switzerland
only.  I had to verify this for a DES program a friend of mine wrote, DESHEL20
(check archie for a list of sites).  Basically that covers most of the free
world.

There were some Senate hearings on the matter this year, although I really
didn't have the time to follow them.  Anyone out there know any more about
the results (if any, hehheh) of the hearings?

Btw: for those of you out there with a copy of the August 29, 1991 Federal
Register Vol 56, No 168, please refer to pages 42875 and 42876...  In 
in particular Section 5E11A Advisory Note 5.  Under that, DES could possibly 
(I haven't verified this interpretation) be shipped legally to the People's
Republic of China, provided that it is for civil use. (I personally oppose the
export of encryption technology to the PRC).

Granted, a lot of people are still ignorant of even the exportability of 
crypto technology in the "new world order".

As far as I know, the only countries that the GDTR letter of assurance does
not allow are as follows (this may be out of date):

Group   Countries
-----   ------------------------------------------------------------------

        Afghanistan, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, People's Republic of China, Syria

  Q     Romania

  S     Libya

  W     Czechoslovakia, Poland

  Y     Albania, Bulgaria, Cambodia, Estonia, Laos, Latvia, Lithuania,
        Mongolian People's Republic, Geographic area of the former 
        Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (includes Armenia, Azerbaijan,
        Belorussia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Maldovia, Russia, Tajikistan, 
        Turkmanistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan)

  Z     Cuba, North Korea, Vietnam

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

That was transcribed from the sample letter of assurance that the author of
DESHEL20 had shown me, and that was sent to him by the Bureau of Export Admin.

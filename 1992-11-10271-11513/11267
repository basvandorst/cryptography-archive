I'm looking for Unix C source for a small encryption program.  It doesn't
have to be anything elaborate. I'd like to encrypt almost all my files in
my account when I log out and decrypt them (interactively) when I log on.

If you've developed such a program and you'd like to share it with me,
please send me email.  Please keep in mind that I'm a relative newcomer
to Unix, C, & cryptography so simplicity and compactness is important.
Compactness to me is source code that is less than 500k and executable
under 175k (in uncompressed states).  Thanks in advance.

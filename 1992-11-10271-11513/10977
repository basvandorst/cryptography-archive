I'm not so sure.  Switches are involved in every call right now.  
Also, the majority of calls are unlikely to be encrypted and key 
negotiation only takes  place at the beginning of a call.  But this
is a good point.

Wouldn't the calling device have to send a bit saying "I'm starting an
encrypted call" so that the called device would know that it's 
receiving an encrypted call anyway?

Yes, the technique seems to mainly applicable to real-time phone calls.
I believe this is the area of greatest concern to LE.

Let's say that a warrant has been obtained.  Then the telco would set
a flag in the switch, say, indicating that your communications stream
was to be intercepted.  The software in the switch would use this to
determine whether to send a copy of your stream to the government
monitoring station.  A similar strategy could be used to activate the
crypto device.

The switches can do this already.  Indeed, I would suppose they do 
some traffic analysis anyway for the purpose of resource analysis and 
capacity planning.

Yes, this is a problem.

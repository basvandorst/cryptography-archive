	   And another thing dammit! ;-) I can't help grimacing whenever I hear 
	   someone use the word "politically correct".  That little phrase has
	   been the biggest success story in the right wing's campaign
	   to ridicule diversity. Even people on the left seem to use it.
	   Its a red herring and it is usually used to batter people into
	   being silent on issues of racism and sexism.  If you complain of
	   insensitivity to the feelings of any group OTHER than hetero-sexual
	   WASPS you are being "politically correct".   Right!

Hey, pull over, buddy. History police. Caught you racing off in all
directions here, probably from a bad case of youth. Phil was giving a
perfect example of the original use of "politically correct" *by the
Left*. Do you perhaps remember "self-criticism"? Let's back up further.
Do you remember Chairman Mao? Have you ever seen a Little Red Book?
Is the New Left now the Old Left? (Funny, there was a sendup of
exactly this on Murphy Brown last night. Synchro!)

While it's true that the current usage of the term is almost always
snide, the history of it provides ample justification. 

I don't know where to send followups, maybe alt.politics.correct,
which I don't read, so I didn't redirect. Maybe we should check that
group for a FAQ list ;-)

Note that the patents owned by PKP are almost certainly invalid outside the
USA, since they were applied for after publication.  However, if the GATT
agreement is signed such patents will likely become enforcable throughout
Europe.  Mail me for more information about GATT.

According to the author of PGP, Philip Zimmermann, PKP have stated that they
will not offer a license to any user of PGP.  (See the PGP manual, volume II,
"Legal Issues".)  Someone is not telling the entire truth.  Who is it?

Fear, uncertainty and doubt.  US citizens may have cause for concern, but it
seems implausible to me that the US government would go after people in other
countries who have never imported or exported anything from the US.

Weren't you just asking us to check with our corporate lawyers?  What good is
a "non-commercial use only" encryption scheme?  Who decides what is
"commercial" use?

Whereas you can use PGP to communicate with people in other countries.

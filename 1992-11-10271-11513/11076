    There is a balance between the recovery of "public money" and not
    removing the incentive to comercialise an invention. Remember that the
    public also gets money back ( thorugh taxes etc) when an invention is
    successfully developed and sold.

Um, remember we are talking about patents *preventing* inventions
from being developed and sold.

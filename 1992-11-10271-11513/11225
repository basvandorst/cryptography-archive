(1) The RSA patent is clearly overbroad.  Whether PGP falls under what it
should be restricted to would be up to the courts, if RSA wants to
prosecute.

(2) Some uses of PGP are protected under that patent law, even if it is
subject to patent.  Consult a patent lawyer for more information.

(3) Distributing source code with appropriate disclaimers (possibly as RSA
claims) is exactly what patent law was intented to encourage...
experimentation with concepts/ideas to create new ideas.

Irrelevant.  Only Phil, himself, might be liable.  The is no restriction
under ITAR against importing arms that were illegal to export.  (If
datapaths from one foreign site to another pass through the US, it seems
likely the the re-exporter could also be prosecuted, if anyone can trace
the links to find out who it is.)

Are RSAREF sources available?  If not, there is little benefit to it's use
by people who don't trust RSA/PKP not have put in a "trap door".

First, thanks for being willing to modify your stand.  I still don't
agree with your new proposal -- it is about as friendly as turning all
employers into branch offices of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service -- but I'm glad that we can at least continue the discussion.

So let me try to pare this down to its essentials.  Are you really
willing to turn over to the Government the ability to examine all of
your communications?  Assume that, sooner or later, some bureaucrat
will come up with some justification, no matter how ridiculous, for
examining every single thing you ever choose to encrypt.

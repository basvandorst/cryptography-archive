Where did you ever get /that/ idea?  Good grief!

--and fear of despots is what makes people fight for their freedom.  Thus
my argument: you need to find ways to illustrate the danger that are as
vivid as the demons you are being fought with.

Uh, I'm getting the funny feeling you didn't even listen, so how can you
possibly say anything about "talk" like mine?  I note that you carefully
deleted the parts of my message where I said I was offering what I thought
were the most potent pro-restriction arguments as a challenge, and /not/
as an expression of my personal opinion (which is pretty much anti-
restriction).

Great!  Other than righteous indignation, how do you counter it?  There
are no doubt some people who feel cryptography is /more/ dangerous than
explosives.  But that's not the point; rather, you are going to have to
counter such views with substance.

>       What secrets do YOU have?

Nothing that I feel requires encryption--nothing of a personal nature, at
least--and I suspect that a lot of people feel that way.  But that's
irrelevent, as I'm sure you'll agree.

Nice commentary, but it assumes that most folks feel cryptography is
somehow tied to their personal privacy and cherished freedoms.  I was
attempting to point out that this is likely /not/ the perception of
most folk.  Everyone has secrets.  How is cryptography relevent to
most people's secrets?  I'm not saying it isn't, but this question is
a weak link in your chain of argument.

Ah.  I don't think that the proposals you speak of necessarily have much
to do with any laws which are likely to be proposed.  By assuming
restrictions beyond those, you weaken your case since you can be
countered with "our law is much less restrictive than that."

Well, I suspect that many folks here in sci.crypt would be happy just to
prevent restrictions on cryptography, for the time being.  Sending
America back to civics class is the long way around.  I agree that our
freedoms are underappreciated.  But is such education a practical
approach in this case?

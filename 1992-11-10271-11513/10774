_I_ think this would violate the Fifth Amendment.  Also, it might be
physically impossible, as the key generator would probably be in equipment
seized, as well as the encrypted files.

In addition, as I noted in another message, there is no duty to actively
cooperate with a warrent; only to provide the information.  (I can't
remember what case it was, but a defendant in a government civil case once
provided about 10,000,000 pages of documents to the government, saying
"what you asked for is in there somewhere, but we don't know how to find
it."  I'm not sure what happened on appeal.)

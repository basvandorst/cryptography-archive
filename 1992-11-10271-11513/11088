	Let's just jump ahead and to thwart the attempt to limit freedoms of
speech and security in papers. How?

	Lets get as many of the people of all places using strong crypto
systems as we can. RSA is licensed for personal use to individuals by my
reading of the FAQ.

	So, lets implement on an individual level RSA into the E-mail system.
First to encrypt mail as it comes in (to prevent unauthorized disclosure). And
later to authenticate the sender and the content of E-mail. Both are usefull
and of benifit to society.

	I think I'll start on my personal copy of mail in place encryption
software. I'll be happy to discuss this with anyone (not that I have a clue)
directly.

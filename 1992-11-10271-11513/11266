again, how do you enforce this? "more powerful methods" are already
out. should we censor Scientific American? sounds very much like
a police state to me. and it -still- wouldn't work.

sorry, the police are under -no- obligation to protect you, much less
your data. not only that, but they're already overworked & often
incapable of enforcing the silly laws we've given them. i have a -lot-
of respect for most law enforcement officers, but even they will admit
that we're living in a world where pizza gets to your house faster
than the police. laws don't protect people (or data). -people- 
protect people (and data). take away the individual's ability to protect
themselves & we'll see a society where no one is safe from "those who
have no business in decrypting his data". 99% of the time, that includes
the government.

 I have seen no proposal to change this.

 Nor this.

 Right.  We are discussing the use of the new technology of
 computers and cryptography, and just what "rights" and "limits"
 apply to the new situation.

 Nonsense.  Clearly you are not required to yield your memories.
 However, *anything* (you) write or "have" *can* be "obtained
 without (your) consent for use against (you)," provided only that
 a specific warrant does issue for probable cause.

 Before computers and modern cryptography, this was an issue which
 was not pervasive, and so did not need to be addressed.  Perhaps
 that is no longer the case.

 Apparently you have some direct connection to the Founding Fathers
 which I do not.

 Since I have access only to the document itself, I can only form
 an opinion by reading it, and I believe my position is entirely
 consistent with the Fourth Amendment.

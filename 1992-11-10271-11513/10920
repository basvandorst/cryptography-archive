Sorry to join this too-voluminous-to-read thread at this point, but I
don't understand why people are proposing registration of encryption keys.

The implication seems to be that this is to placate law enforcement people
who want to continue to be able to tap/intercept/read private communications,
perhaps to stop them from trying to ban encryption altogether?

Is this some sort of joke?  Do people seriously suggest such sort of
placation is necessary or a good idea?  Or is it law enforcement that's
pushing for this registration?

There is no need to compromise.  Law enforcement is just going to have to
face a hard fact -- in a few years they won't be able to wiretap.  It is
a heavy price for them to pay, but the other options are simply too much of
a burden on either our freedoms, or our industries.   I think the chance of
them winning a ban on encryption are small.  There is no need for anybody
to compromise with key registration schemes that will be meaningless in the
long run.

(Surely any criminal element would use a registered key for outside encryption
and an unregistered method for inside encryption, facing only the charge of
unregistered encryption if they are wiretapped.)

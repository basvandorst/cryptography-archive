Stock traders who violate the insider trading rules now don't do so in
plain view of the public.  They use bank accounts in the Bahamas, furtive
meetings, and so forth.  Cryptography won't make any difference.

The main tools for catching insider trading are (I think)

  (1) tips (including getting defendants to rat on their associates)
  (2) computer analysis of trading patterns

Cryptography won't affect either one.

Dunno.

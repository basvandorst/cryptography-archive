Jyrki Kuoppala * they do  doesn't injure anyone  - but it  is well known
                 and well documented that  pornography makes people rape
                 innocent little girls and reefers make the XXXX XXXXXXX
                 go  after  ordinary  XXXXX  women  and  rape them. Even
                 bullets won't work against the people under influence

     I surely  hope your post was  'tongue in cheek' however,  I for one
     did not see  any humor in it. Besides being  bigoted, racist, it is
     also inflammatory and based on half truths. I for one wish that you
     would refraim from  postings such rantings or at  least temper them
     with some truth and common decency.

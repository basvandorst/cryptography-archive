Carl Ellison * That's  unfortunate, if  true. They'll  have to  get busy
               guessing what  the suspect might  have used as  a private
               key for IDEA-encrypted keys. The  same would apply to raw
               DES or IDEA. It doesn't have to be PGP.

  True and the  officer as much said that  he could of used any  type of
  encryption technique.  He simply choose PGP.

Carl Ellison * PGP shares no guilt in child molestation.

   I hope that is not what I implied.

Carl Ellison * And, to repeat, PGP is not an issue here. This applies to
               *any*   secret-key  encryption   algorithm  --   publicly
               available or personally invented.
                                 = = =

   No PGP is not the issue here.  The question posed was with cases like
   this it  is obvious to me  that some regulation will  be imposed upon
   the use  of encryption technology. Some  is being done so  right now.
   For instance the NIST is pushing  for DSS while the computer industry
   wants RSA.

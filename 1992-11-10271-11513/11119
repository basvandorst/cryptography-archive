Hmmm...

	"Guns dont kill people,  People with guns kill people." "Keys
	dont kill people,  People with keys kill people."

Doesnt' really work now does it?  Mabey:

	"Keys dont lie cheat and steal,  People with keys lie cheat and
	steal."

Still sounds kind of stupid...  How about:

	"Keys dont do crimes,  People with keys do crimes."

Yea.  That's it....

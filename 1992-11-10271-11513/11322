Nice try.


I predict that in the future -- with the geographic distribution of both
computer systems and companies -- there will be widespread cryptographic
protection on inter-office phones, FAXes, video-conference machines,
cellular phones and corporate computer networks.  There will also be easily
available cryptographic protection of files.  All of this is needed to
allow corporations to function free from industrial espionage.

Many companies will have nothing but PCs for their computers, so all of
this crypto will be on PCs.  (Guess what: it is today, already)

To prohibit use of crypto by convicted felons you would have to prohibit
their employment in a large class of industries.

This is probably illegal -- or might easily be made illegal -- since it
works against the criminal's decision to go straight and build a new life.

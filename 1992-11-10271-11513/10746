The taunts are unworthy of this newsgroup.


What is being rejected is:

1.	any attempt to get readers of this group into a "here's the
	ciphertext, try to break it" game

2.	any alleged cryptosystem which has no key (and is therefore
	useless)


If you (and I doubt there's any friend) want to have the system reviewed,
publish it.

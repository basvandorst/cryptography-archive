yes.

Since you haven't shown anyone your algorithm, or even output from
it, I don't see how you can expect anything else.

Sure, but I can't until you post some data.

By the way, RNG-based encryption can be extremely strong, depending
on how good the random number generator is.  One based on DES, for
example, could be very, very strong.  I came across a RNG-based
encryption algorithm a while ago, and I can tell you from experience
that it was not "real easy to crack," especially since I had no idea
what compiler was used.  If that isn't obvious to you and your friend,
I'm afraid it's quite unlikely that your algorithm is useful.

It says essentially nothing about the strength of the algorithm, and
is not incompatible with my earlier guess about how it might work.

I'd be happy to take a crack at it, it you'd be so kind as to post
some plaintext/ciphertext instead of making inappropriate comments.
This whole discussion is wasting net bandwidth, and the few of us who
haven't already it into our kill files are starting to wonder what
you are trying to hide, since you've posted nothing.

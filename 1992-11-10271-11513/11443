         This is nonsense.  There are numerous historical instances
where people have sucessfully traded freedom for security.  For example
Finland after WWII gave up some freedom to the USSR in exchange for
security from invasion.  The English people gave up some freedom during
WWII in order to better fight the Nazis.
         In the case of Germany it is ludicrous to suggest that the
German people elected Hitler out of a desire for security.  They chose
Hitler as the best man to overturn the Treaty of Versailles.  It was
obvious even at the time that this would involve grave risks.
         In the case of Argentina and Chile the people did not give up
freedom it was taken from them.  In the case of Chile at least I see
little reason for those who backed the coup to regret the result.
         The pro-crypto people would do well to come up with some argu-
ments that do not depend on eccentric quasi-religous views of how the
world works.

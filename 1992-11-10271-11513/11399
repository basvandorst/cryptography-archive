   Yes, the gov't can break it -- but is much less likely to abuse it if it
   knows that a log of all taps is being recieved by the ACLU and the NYTimes
   and the heads of both major political parties prior to any session key
   being released (as part of the protocol for session key release).

Only the two (identical) major parties?  Boring!  And the NY Times is
scarcely better.  At least the ACLU is a start.
You really need to give it to the Libertarians, the Greens, the Reds,
Pacifica News, Ralph Nader, the Weekly World News, and enough
rabidly independent organizations that the government won't abuse it.

Just give the environmentalists enough rope.  They've already started to try
to pull us down the slippery slope with gas taxes, emissions controls,
"alternative" energy policies...  I can just hear them now: "No one has the
right to endanger the Planet by the anti-environmental act of driving their
own vehicle.  Let them take public transportation."

And it bears repeating: the power to tax is the power to destroy.

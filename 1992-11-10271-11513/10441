It appears that RSA has had patent protection for about 15 years. Yet
there are no readily available standard RSA systems for use on Macs,
nor standard electronic mail packages widely available for purchase
using RSA (though it is claimed that Apple's OCE will include at
least message authentication next year).

I'm curious about what people think about why this is. Is it that RSA
are poor marketers?  poor at raising capital to start a "proper"
business and hiring good marketers? that there is really little
widespread demand for such systems in the "mass" software market?
other explanations?

To avoid flames, none of the above are more than logical possibilities,
and they should not be read as personal attacks on RSA.

Well, our <insert_your_favorite_epitet> legislators have one 
sure way to fight any ugly problem, including this one:

	Since now consider One-Time Pad cryptosystems
	illegal to possess and as difficult to find,
	as illegal drugs and illegal guns! Voila,
	the loophole is plugged (:-).
	
	Can you imagine any criminal daring to use
	one-time pad now? (:-)

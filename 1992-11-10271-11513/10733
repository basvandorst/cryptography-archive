    Well, Jim, I have a few questions for the "California law enforcement
official" the next time he calls your BBS:
 
1) Why did he have to call Little Rock when just about any university in
   California could have FTP'ed a copy for him, and many California BBS's
   carry PGP20 and PGP20SRC?
2) How can he have identified the guy as a molestor (not "alleged molestor")
   when the ONLY evidence against the guy is in PGP-encrypted files?
3) How does he even know that the files contain such evidence?
4) If he doesn't have PGP yet, how does he know the files are PGP-encrypted?
5) What kind of records do molestors keep anyway?  Having never been one, I
   wouldn't know, but I'd guess that such a "profession" would not feel a
   crying need for accurate books.
 
    Also, I wouldn't worry about the distribution aspect on this one, Jim.
Since the "molester" probably would have used the -c option to encrypt his
own files (why use a public/private pair?), he could have just as easily,
and as effectively, used any public-domain implementation of the DES to
serve his fiendish purposes.  And the DES has been available for MS-DOS
machines for years.

    To answer your question, though, I really think it's a non-issue.  I
mean, I'm sure the only records that most molestors keep are mental.  Should
we pass a law that all citizens must keep a permanent written record of any
"perverse" thought that crosses their minds, so even sex offenders will
leave a paper trail to facilitate prosecution?  Neither should encryption
be limited for that reason.  Besides, what kind of crime would leave its
ONLY evidence locked in the perp's head or in his ciphertext files?

But that isn't true, either.  No legislation need be violated, no charges
filed.  All that has to happen is "probable cause" be found by a judge, then
they can (and often do) take everything.  Registration of cars can be used
to make this easier.  And I haven't covered indirect taxation as practiced

That's easy.  Where in the Constitution are the powers delegated to the
Federal government to register cars, guns, crypto gear, computers, etc.?
Nowhere.  Thus, it's an unconstitutional as well as tyrannical power grab for
this to be done.

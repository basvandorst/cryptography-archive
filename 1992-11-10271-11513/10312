In this instance a more appropriate quotation is something John 
Quincy Adams wrote to James Lloyd in 1822: 
        Individual liberty is individual power, and as the 
        power of the community is a mass compounded of 
        individual powers, the nation which enjoys the most 
        freedom must necessarily be in proportion to its 
        numbers the most powerful nation.

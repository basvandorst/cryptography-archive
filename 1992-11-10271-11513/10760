As I understand it, the right to free speech/press means:

 - The government can't stop you in advance from making such utterances
   (as by cutting out your tongue or confiscating your newspaper).

 - The government is unhampered in punishing you afterward, if, for
   example, your statements result in harm or the risk of harm to others.

 - The government can pass laws to define in advance what sort of
   behavior will be punished.

The "fire in a crowded theater" scenario is repeatedly and continually
raised by the enemies of free speech.  This is the first time I have
EVER seen a claim that the Supreme Court decided that no right to make
such an utterance exists.  Can you give us a citation?

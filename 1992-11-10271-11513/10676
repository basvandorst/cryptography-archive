Of course, everyone has the capability and right to encrypt -- at home and
for personal use or for personal communication.  However, we have some
control over those politicians, since they work for us.  We can require
them to register all keys (archive all messages) for traffic done during
their government work.  We can even require that their systems be built in
such a way as to automatically archive all traffic -- not just rely on
backup tapes of encrypted messages which were used against Ollie in his
hearing before Congress.

Perhaps we should require all government officials to do so, but the real
criminals like Ollie North would find a way around that, too.  The answer
I'm afraid is that we'll always have criminals in government and we just
have to make sure that they will be found out eventually and will never
have the power to really hurt us.

This has little to do with the discussion at hand, but I'm going to throw
it in anyway. By Roman Law virgin girls were not allowed to be executed.
Thus when the Emperor Tiberius (I think, maybe it was Caligula) wanted an
entire family killed the two young girls were handed over to the executioner
who raped them and then executed them.

Fun thing history isn't it. Almost as good as religion.

     A problem, but not an unsurmountable one.

     15 keys, 10^4 length = 1.5E5 bytes/person (I'm being generous - I could
     have assumed you meant bits).

     World pop = ~ 5E9

     implies 7.5E14 bytes storage required.

     The largest online storage device I've heard of is a 12 Terabyte
     (1.2E13) device, which is currently being researched by NASA. 

     The appropriate government agencies would have no trouble purchasing
     the 63 machines needed. For the US population, you'd only need 3
     or 4.

     Wait a decade, and you'll have that much at home.

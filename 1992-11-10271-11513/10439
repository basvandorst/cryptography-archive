Though I agree with those who say that the issue of crypto key registration
is separate from the issue of gun registration (perhaps because some of
the speakers oppose the first and support the second), let's not forget
that the NRA has been very politically effective in stopping gun
registration laws that many of us support. Perhaps it wouldn't be
a bad idea to enlist them in opposing any attempt to to control crypto use
and crypto keys by ordinary citizens and businessmen.

By the way, I would support a law making it a criminal offense to use
cryptology to aid criminal or espionage enterprises, provided it were
limited to after-the-fact use to increase penalties on those convicted
of such crimes, rather than before-the-fact use to limit civil
liberties of ordinary citizens.

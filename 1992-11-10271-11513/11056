This is incorrect, posting it here would not make it a public domain
program.  A minor technicality, as your friend would effectively lose
the ability to control its distribution, which I assume is his primary
concern.  Posting a description of the algorithm should not be a
problem, as far as "other implications" go.

Well, if we could guess it by looking at the file, that is not very
interesting.  It does not help to understand the cryptosystem, which
would be the primary interest in the first place.

And, there is one small problem.  The issue is the unicity distance of
the algorithm.  It is impossible to decrypt ciphertext that is shorter
than the unicity distance of the algorithm.  For instance, the
ciphertext DFJUG resulting from a simple substitution could be any five
letter word that had no repeated letters.  It is possible that the
surrounding context is insufficient to determine the correct decryption.
For instance, it could be a proper noun that does not appear anywhere
else in the plaintext.

Cryptanalysis is quite ineffective in some circumstances.  This is also
precisely what we have been trying to tell you, although obviously we
have not succeeded in that endeavor.  However, the reason to "mess"
around with DES, RSA and PGP is obvious.  These algorithms have been
disclosed, subjected to a large amount of analysis, and found to be
relatively secure.  Ie., it would take the resources of a government
agency to be a serious threat to the security of those particular
algorithms, given the current technology.  People are still working on
analysing them, as technology may very well change their suitability or
the size of keys required for relative security.

There is no way to know if anybody could do it.  This is what we have
been trying to tell you, although ineffectively.  The real question, is
can you and your friend make a suitable challenge such that people are
willing to take you up on it.  After all, you are essentially asking
others to expend a potentially large amount of effort for little or no
reward.  Think of it as a challenge...

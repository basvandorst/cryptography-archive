Nope.

Sure, but P=NP and P<>NP are certainly not equally likely.  The a priori
evidence that P<>NP is *overwhelming*; to claim that P=NP has a chance
of being true is worse than claiming that there is a chance of only a
finite number of twin primes existing.  Both are unproven, but there are
*very* strong reasons for believing them to be true.  So strong that
anyone who believes otherwise must be either ignorant or a crackpot.

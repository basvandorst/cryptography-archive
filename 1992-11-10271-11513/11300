If you go back into the sixties and seventies, you'll find that
several government initiatives in this area were defeated.  For
instance, there was a serious proposal for a national identity
number that was defeated.

Likewise, there is the Freedom of Information act, one of whose
primary purposes is to keep the government open and above-board.
If they steal your privacy, they have to worry a little about 
being caught.

Finally, there is (theoretically) some regulation of private
credit bureaus.  I am not very impressed with the actual results,
and I think some more openness laws are needed, but government is
not immune to the cry from even a small group of intelligent 
citizens to protect their privacy.  There was hardly a nation-wide
hue and cry for any of this and much of it was opposed by interests
that worry you (and me).

Now, I'll grant that none of this stuff is a panacea, but it does
show that we shouldn't concede anything -- we might win.

History shows that people won't even do this much.  Consider the
equivalent.  Do you have a large data processing system available to
you?  Does it have RSA or DES installed?  How often do _you_, a 
knowledgable person, use them?

The other major problem is to make it automatic and hidden.  We may love
ciphers and cryptography, but nearly everyone else considers it "overhead"
and "in the way".  If we have to stop and talk to the government first,
there'll be even less crypto in use than there already is.  And, people
will persuade themselves the government has inserted "trap doors" in it
all anyway, get fatalistic, and skip the whole thing.

Telephones are a special problem, because even though we probably are
close to being able to include the required hardware for low cost,
I don't know how to do the key exchange without some user involvement
and I don't think very many folks are interested.  At most, it will
have to be a very short sequence (kind of like defeating call waiting).

Your public key suggestion has merit in that environment, but if we
have to tell the government, we end up giving them the key to every
encrypted conversation we ever had, because I doubt if anyone ever
changes their public/private key pair.  Too much hassle to set up.

So, if the government wants to go fishing, all they need is an excuse to
subpoena my key, and they get all the illicitly recorded stuff.  If I do
anything controversial enough to catch their attention, they'll find an
excuse.

I am no professional in 'sci.crypt' so what I write here might be pure
nonsense. We are discussing about someone who claims to have
invented a *new* method to encrypt data. We do not know anything about
keys and algorithms. 
But if this man wants to USE his new method, the algorithm to encrypt and
decrypt data has to be distributed in several places. Thus he would
not be able to hinder an opponent to gain access to the algorithm.
As far as I can see _all_ modern crypto-systems assume the algorithm
is known to everybody who cares, the 'secure' parts are keys or 
part of keys. Or am I wrong ? (I am not talking about 'hiding' information
but about encryption.)
So I can understand that this friend wants to keep the algorithm secret, and
let this newsgroup play around with a crypted text, just to protect
his mind's work, but this is not a very realistic approach.
If he would come up with his algorithm, then perhaps a more funded opinion
might come back from this newsgroup, than the stuff I have read until now.
(The word 'idiot' has fallen much too often IMHO.)

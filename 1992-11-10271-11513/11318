   No, the problem is convincing enough people that they need such a thing.

One way to do that would be to market a cryptophone that also gave
better PHONE service, like a high-fidelity audio phone or a video phone,
and hit the market with both features from the beginning.
Both of those systems already require digitizing data and 
including fast cheap CPU power -- adding encryption at most adds
a $20 DSP chip and some firmware.

A fundamental problem with most "better" communication systems,
like Picturephone(tm), faster-than-ever-before modems, etc.,
is that they're mainly worth buying when there's somebody else to call,
but they're incompatible with previous standards.
If we can piggyback crypto on some inherently desirable service,
and provide a fallback to interoperable service (e.g. vanilla voice)
maybe we can jumpstart the market.  ISDN offers some opportunities,
since ISDN stuff is all new anyway.

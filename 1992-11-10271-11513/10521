...under the law the NSA is forbidden to do domestic surveillance....

silly.  to security organizations the "law" is just another cover.  It's
amusing to watch these guys who hate the government, won't pay taxes,
reject all ideas of social responsibility orchestrated through government,
defend the good intentions of the garrison state security apparatus.  they're
usually also gun nuts.

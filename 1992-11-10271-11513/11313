Check out TIME magazine, May 28, 1990, page 50

"When 'Friends' Become Moles"

(my copy was c/o Cylink -- part of their sales material, for obvious
reasons)

It doesn't answer your question.  I have seen no specific recommendation
on cryptosystems by NSA.  I'd be surprised if they would say anything
like that.



Richard Outerbridge in Cryptologia a while ago was recommending triple
DES for all financial transactions.  I would second that recommendation
(pref -- in CBC mode

	encr(k1,i1,decr(k2,i2,encr(k3,i3,datum)))

), which provides 360 bits of key.  If the CBC is made an option, then
this can be turned into what others call double DES or single DES
by proper choice of keys.

The CBC options would have to be:

a.	off	(no IV)
b.	around the whole block of DESs	(one IV only)
c.	around each of the three DESs	(three IVs, as shown above)

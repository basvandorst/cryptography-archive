Really?  Looking at the reports on Usenet, the hand of government in
USA seems to be very heavy there - and also in other countries (the
hand of US government, that is).

I have seen little basis for the claims that USA is somehow "more
free" than "most other" or "many other" "western" countries.  To the
contrary, I would say.  This probably has to do with the fact that
there's a tradition of watching for these things in USA, while not in
many other countries.  But I don't think that explains it all - the
civil forfeiture, War on Drugs, covert foreign operations and such are
things I think few people outside USA would accept for their
government to do.  Yes, I agree that in USA there's a great
Constitution while in many (most?) other "western" countries there
isn't - and UK has an "official secrets act".  But in practice it
doesn't seem to make a difference.

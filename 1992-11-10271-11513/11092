        Yah. Right. Quite a coincidence that this happens within days
        of an identical hypothetical case being posted in this group.
        It's probably safe to assume that Jim actually believes this
        brown mushy stuff, but...

        (1) The guy's not a molester if they have no evidence (isn't
            that what US law says?) It's hard to believe that a file
            submitted as hearsay (see-say?) evidence would convict
            anyone in the absence of something more substantial.

        (2) Why do the police need to get a copy of PGP? If the patsy
            used PGP, then he'd have to have a copy of it not far from
            the encrypted data. Could they really introduce decrypted
            evidence without proving that the patsy had access to the
            encryption software? Could it be that they intend to get a
            little creative?

        (3) Could it be that somebody in Cal. read Terry's post and
            thought of a neat way to put a chill on PGP distribution?

        (4) Is it possible that the call actually came from one of
            Jim's users who's more anal-retentive than most about what
            Jim makes available on his system?

        (5) Could it be that Jim's found a poignant way to reintroduce
            a topic we all thought had been beaten to death?

            Cheers,

                Marc

The Financial Services Act of 1986 allows the SIB to compel testimony. It
can also delegate powers to recognised professional bodies such as the Law
Society and to clearing organisations, which might include APACS but
certainly includes the stock exchange.

If you are a director of a company, or acting on behlaf of a company, then 
the DTI (which also enforces crypto equipment export controls for GCHQ) has
similar powers.

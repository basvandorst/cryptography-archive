No, no, no. Look the 1st doesn't even enter into in any such court case.
You would be on trial for unlawful injury to others assuming anyone was
injured. The 1st amendment in fact does allow you to say anything you
damn well please, anywhere you please. It is up to legal code separate
from that to deal with accusations of slander, libel, and similar 
"damage to others" categories.

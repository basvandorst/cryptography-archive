Maybe I am out of line posting this in this group.  If so, I apoligize.
Is there a need to absolutly identify that a document is authentic?  I 
hold a patent on a covert forensic marking system.  It is unseen.  It is 
below resolution of the eye at 20 micrometers.  It is difficult to 
find-much less duplicate.  Comments?

Regards.

Gary.

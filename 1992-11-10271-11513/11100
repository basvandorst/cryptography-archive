Sorry, no.  Repeating a falsehood does not make it true.  All we know is that
it MIGHT be stronger.

Consider TES, the Trivial Encryption Standard - it's just like DES except that
TES(P,k) = k || DES(P,k) (|| is concatenation).  That is, TES "gives away the
store" at the beginning of the ciphertext.  It's clear that if DES isn't a
group, neither is TES.  It's also clear that double TES is exactly as strong
as single TES.

If there were a generic unknown-plaintext attack against DES, it would work
just as well against double DES, requiring double the time.  (Yes, this would
make double DES just a bit stronger - but multiplicative factors - especially
such small ones! - are ignored when we discuss the strength of cryptosystems.

A pure chosen-plaintext attack against DES would not move directly to double
DES.  But that only says something about ONE PARTICULAR ATTACK; it says
nothing about the inherent strength of the cryptosystem.

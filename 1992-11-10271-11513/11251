The first issue of `Computer and Communications Security Reviews' is due 
to be published next week.

This journal contains about 200 abstracts of recently published research
papers, including most of the papers at Eurocrypt 92 and Crypto 92. In 
addition to cryptology, it covers operating system and database security, 
formal methods, security management, applications and engineering; the 
second issue should cover NCSC, ESORICS, Auscrypt and the Foundations 
Workshop as well as journal papers.

I have a number of complimentary copies to distribute. If you think your 
organisation might be interested in subscribing, please send me an email
with your name and address. First come first served!

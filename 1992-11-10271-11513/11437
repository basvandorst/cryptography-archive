Andrew, I think you are seriously overstating the case.
Individual use (in fact, ALL use) of RSA in the US is controlled by 
PKP (public Key Partners) the PGP documentation clearly says that you have
to get the rights to RSA from PKP. If you bother to do that,
you will find that they do not require a license for
"individual, academic, or educational" use. The quote is from
the RSA FAQ, available via FTP from rsa.com.

There is nothing even close to "very ILLEGAL" about it.

I'd gladly send you PGP encrypted mail to PO the NSA, FBI,
CIA, KGB, MAD, MI5, etc. I don't have a Next. I do have PGP.
What is your PGP public key?

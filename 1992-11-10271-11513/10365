   The theory is that U.S. companies that the NSA likes will be able to
   buy NSA-blessed black boxes to protect their communications.  This
   is already possible -- the Type II STU-III's are sold only to defense
   contractors.

For you conspiracy theory folk, it is of course well known that GCHQ
does not spy on British communications; neither does NSA on US
communications.  However, there is nothing to stop the two
organisations from trading information.

I am not necessarily suggesting that GCHQ intercepts US comms.

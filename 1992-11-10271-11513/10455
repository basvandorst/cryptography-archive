Perhaps you don't know what I referred to when I said that Switzerland has
citizen vetoes.  A minority of of the Swiss electorate can nullify legislation.
My understanding is that one third is required to do this, and this doesn't
completely bar oppression of smaller minorities, but I stand by my claim that
Switzerland thus has the highest degree of consent by the governed in the
world.

True, there still may be oppression, but less than anywhere else.

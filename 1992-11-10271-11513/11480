When I bought my current computer, I did it by cashier's check.  They
wouldn't give me more than $2000 or so -- I had to do some wierdness
involving multiple banks.  Several different banks had the same
limit, so it's either an industry-wide convention or a Federal
requirement.  The peculiar part was that they would, as I recall,
allow cash withdrawals greater than that limit.

NeXT could not export 3.0 if it included FEE.  In this case it was
"all or nothing."  There was no point in trying to deal with all the
hassles of exportable and non-exportable versions just for FEE.

FYEO uses either FEE or EE.  EE is a well documented algorithm and it
is recognized as secure.  While the mathematical speedups in FEE may
weaken the algoritm, it comes down to "how secure must this really
be."  Crypt is not secure.  I would say that DES is not secure as well
if you want to talk about theoretical absolutes.  I would say that DES
is "secure enough" unless you need to keep things secure from
governments with the resources to break it.

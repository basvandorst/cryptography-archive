I already know how to factor huge primes.  Factoring huge primes is
trivial.  By definition, primes no matter how large, only have two
factors.  I even know, by definition, what the factors are.  It is
factoring other large numbers that is difficult.  It is particularly
difficult if the large numbers only have a limited number of factors.

Indeed, the community is already good at factoring the product of large
primes.  However, it is very expensive.  The difficulty is a function of 
the size of the number.  It is not important that it always be as difficult
as it is today.  It is only important that we know how expensive it is.

If you are suggesting that we will ever have a method of factoring the 
product of large primes that is independent of the size of the number, 
that is a question of a different order.  It belongs on the same list as
the question of whether we will ever be able to travel faster than light.
In both cases, the available evidence is against it, but we can always
hope.

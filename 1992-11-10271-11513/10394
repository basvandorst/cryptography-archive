        Surely I cannot be the only one who feels that the current
        arguments and discussions regarding 'Freedom of Speech' and
        wiretaps and suchlike would probably be more welcome in
        comp.soc.privacy or somewhere similar?

        This is an observation, not an ad hominum attack upon the
        participants - although many of them seem to be having a ball
        attacking each other...

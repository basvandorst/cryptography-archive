OK, let me rephrase my question, since people seems to discuss
everything but what I really wanted to know (not that the discussion
hasn't been interesting - thanks for all the opinions):


Suppose I only *store* my secret keyring on a multiuser system, but
don't actually use it. The evil cracker Bob reads it.

Now, obvoiusly, if I didn't have any pass phrase, Bob could start
forging messages in my name. 

But suppose I do have a pass phrase, and that it's so complicated that
Bob fails to guess it, even using automatic guessing programs. Can Bob
do anything dangerous in this case?

In short: How secure is the pass phrase mechanism of PGP 2.0?

Some on this thread appear to believe that because they live outside
the U.S. and are not U.S. citizens, that their actions need not comply
with U.S. law. Permit me to remind you that the Supreme Court of the 
U.S. has upheld the legality of U.S. agents arresting foreign nationals
on foreign soil for crimes against U.S. law committed on foreign soil.
Unless anyone expects their government to go to war against the U.S. 
to protect them, you had better think twice about violating U.S. law,
whoever you are and wherever you might be.

Welcome to the nineties,

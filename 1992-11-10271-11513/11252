	Read the article the"Two Soviet Spy Ciphers" by David Kahn in
	"Kahn on Codes".  The system used by Hayhanen did several of
	these things and, if I remember correctly, everything was
	susbtituted first.  Another common ploy is to split the message
	down the middle and put the last part first, thereby hiding
	the standard beginnings and endings.  Despite all this, I think
	the transposition would fall to multiple anagramming fairly
	quickly.  Somebody very patiently explained to me that
	transpositions are considered very weak these days.

	Incidentally, the Soviets seem to have put a lot of effort
	into putting field-expedient ciphers together so that they
	wouldn't forever be delivering one-time pads to their
	people.

	I wouldn't do this, it weakens the transposition considerably.

	See above, the Hayhanen system used letter counts rather than
	word boundaries (safer).

	Lots of nulls in this one! (To quote the Queene's Decypherer).

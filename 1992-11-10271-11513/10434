I think both the example and your response are off the mark.  I believe there
is a greater concern over encrypting R&D information being communicated between
a company's R&D researchers than dumping financial data out on the net.  In

negotiation data.  Researchers communicate via computer nets.  Marketeers via
fax machine.

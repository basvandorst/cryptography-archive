I am interested in obtaining a standard RSA compatable key, I only have access to PGP
I have managed to get it to display its calculations :-

256bit calculation.

 modulus n = 2E0574EB 8331D378 71B184F5 1AE02817 
             9EB9113C 366AE339 82549484 74125977 
exponent e = 00000011 
exponent d = 103E2944 102FB40C 645CC583 AF21F008 
             093EA014 A60689FC 56931557 4A36C7D1 
   prime p = 63BB6D2D 38765E6E 5930457A C52DD959 
   prime q = 76218929 D237532A DE839292 5C9E9F4F 
 inverse u = 6A3CD1F9 36DF2A5E 871C4456 3E785001

However I am not sure have have got the meaning of the numbers correct..... 

In standard RSA, 3 things are used general modulus, public key and private key

so does :-

n = the general modulus
d = public key
u = private key 

When I use n, d & u in a standard power modulus algorithm it does not work ;-(
What to I have do do to transform this data into the standard RSA numbers? I know PGP takes some short cuts but have a made a mistake in my calculation or am I using the wrong numbers?

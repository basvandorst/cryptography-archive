 This has not been ignored; this is, in fact, *the reason* for my
 alternative to the other proposals.  Those proposals call for:

    1) getting keys from a common source (CA's), or
    2) registering keys prior to use.

 Under plausible assumptions, both of these proposals support real-
 time wiretapping/deciphering and "fishing expeditions."

 As far as I am concerned, if real-time wiretapping/deciphering
 is possible, there is absolutely no reason to have cryptography
 at all, and it might as well be outlawed.  We can afford to lose
 that fight, because if we do not win it, there will be nothing for
 us anyway.  Who would buy such products?  There are always limits,
 and these are mine.

 On the other hand, within these limits, I am willing to work with
 law enforcement to try and achieve some of their goals.  In
 particular, I believe that after-the-fact due-process audit by
 society is perfectly reasonable and may even be necessary.

 There is no regulation now, and, absent strong calls for
 regulation, we can continue with what we have.  But when the
 issue becomes serious, strong interests will have *already*
 been convinced that *something* will have to be done.  It would
 behoove us to have a reasonable response.  (That is, something
 beyond taunting the government and telling them just what they
 can and cannot do and who they can and cannot control.)

 (Apparently this sort of device is now available from cylink.)

 A consumer cryptophone could be virtually as easy to use as an
 ordinary phone, and it would be a dynamite product.

 The problem is to get the price down such that encryption could be
 just another reasonable feature in a phone purchase, instead of a
 major speculative investment.

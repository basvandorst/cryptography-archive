 Yeah, well, that part is doubtlessly right. We didn't offer enough
 of an incentive. Mostly, this was due to our own enthusiasm for
 solving puzzles and overcoming difficulties. We sort of hoped 
 someone here might share that.  Now, it seems we've been given a 
 challenge _ourselves_!  :-)
 
 However, in our defense, I must point out that no one has excluded 
 any of you from further participation, or from _eventual_ accesss to 
 the algorithm. We just said (and still do) that the algorithm will 
 not be published as a preliminary to this challenge. As usual, what 
 happens afterwards will probably be dictated more by the vagaries of 
 the market, and by our ability to deal with them, than by any 
 technician's work or any test results obtained here.

 We have not precluded such a possibility. But we haven't offered
 it either. We just aren't at that stage yet.

 That, too, will have to be taken into account and looked at. To be 
 fair, we haven't precluded the possibility of testing billions of 
 bytes, if you want to, but creating, storing and working with them 
 would be a REAL project. Our challenge was on more elementary terms, 
 but if you want a billion bytes to play with, you might get a 
 billion bytes...  :-)

 Short of revealing the algorithm at this stage, please tell us how 
 you would like to control the experiment. WE are not making any 
 impositions. Tell us how you want it. We've said this many times
 before.

 I readily accept the above words and feelings. No argument. One
 question, though: are you saying that if we had offered a larger
 prize, your "crippling ethics" would be reduced and your ability
 to emulate the behavior of a crook would be enhanced?  ;-)
 How pragmatic! But mixing pragmatism and ethics seems peculiar. 
 Those two don't work together.

 I am not trying to defeat you. Rather, some of you seem to be intent 
 on defeating me, rather than my challenge.  And no, no one said it 
 would be taken as dispositive. We just wanted to know whether you 
 could decrypt ONE single, short English word among thousands. Can 
 you, mon ami?

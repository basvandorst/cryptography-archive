Hmmm, maybe you're right.  I'll have to try to find references concerning
freedom of movement, right to use public conveyances, etc.  Any pointers
would be appreciated.

It may well be that as long as we observe the necessary rules of behavior
for driving (like using your own lane, not driving drunk and endangering
others exercising their own rights, etc) that we do indeed have the RIGHT
to use the roads we paid for.  Seems fair enough.

I guess auto registration is just for taxation, then.

Of course, if you use a cryptographically strong PRNG, it's as good as a
1-time-pad.  That's the definition of cryptographic strength -- that the
PRNG is indistinguishable by any polynomial time&space test from true
random numbers.

The FAQ was warning against use of standard, canned PRNGs (e.g.,

	x' = a*x+b mod N

) as the generator.

BTW, Ron Rivest published a secure PRNG method in an early Cryptologia.  As
I remember it, he used

	x' = x^2 mod N

taking one bit from each iteration.  If you know x at any time, you can go
forward trivially -- but because sqrt() is multi-valued, you can't go
backwards.  So, he then used TWO such bit streams -- one forward through
the message and one backward.  He XORed the message text with both streams.

[I assume you have to use large numbers N and x0 -- to avoid finally getting
to the value x=1 and having the generator be no good any more.]

   I think history is against you.  There is as much barter in
   the world as there ever was.  There is as much use of gold
   coin as ever.  Currency did not replace these.  Neither did
   checks replace currency or credit cards replace checks.
   We did speak for a decade or more of the "Checkless Society"
   but there are more checks now then than were then, though
   many of us now pay electronically.

Here, in Finland, which is one of the most advanced countries in 
electronic banking, checks are near to extinct. About 60% of shopping
transactions are paid electronically and over 40% of all domestic
transactions are entered to banking system directly via data-transfer.
Almost 100% of transactions between domestic banks are transfered 
electronically. So, IMHO, the electronic banking IS going to replace
printed currency, at least.

And that was just as true BEFORE Canada tried gun control.  Subsequent
increases in the restrictions haven't produced any benefits either.

That's why it isn't surprising to find that factors other than gun
control laws are correlated with the differences between US and
Canadian crime levels; Canada's gun control laws don't seem to have
any effect.  BTW - Those differences don't always favor Canada.

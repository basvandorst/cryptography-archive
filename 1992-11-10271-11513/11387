This situation provides an excellent way to demonstrate a fundamental
approach for reasoning about cryptosystems.

Can double DES encryption be weaker than single DES encryption?  The
answer is, in general, no - and I can prove this knowing nothing at all
about DES.

Suppose it were true that double encryption was weaker, and suppose I'm
a cryptanalyst with access to E(C,k), where E is DES encryption, C is
cleartext, and k is the unknown key.  Rather than attack the "hard"
problem of single DES encryption, I'd simply choose my own k' and do my
own double encryption:  I'd attack the "easier" encryption E(E(C,k),k').
It cannot possibly hurt me that I *know* k'!

Conclusion:  While it may be that for SOME values of k', some kind of
cancellation takes place, if they are at all common, then SINGLE DES
encryption is *already* weak, since looking for such a k' would amount
to an easy attack against it.

General principle:  Anything the cryptanalyst can already do for himself
cannot weaken the cryptosystem significantly - since if it did, he WOULD
do it for himself.

Note that this approach cannot prove that double encryption is HARDER to
break than single encryption - it can only show that it cannot be EASIER.
Whether DES forms a group or not, it is possible that double encryption is
stronger, and it's possible that double encryption is equally strong.
Without further work, we just don't know.  (Actually, "meet in the middle"
attacks show that double encryption, done this way, cannot be MUCH stronger
than single encryption - though it may be SOMEWHAT stronger.)

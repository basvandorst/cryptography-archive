The cost you cite sounds high by a couple of orders of magnitude, but
I'm not an expert on this.  Yet if it is correct, isn't this a big
incentive for the Government to short-circuit the official process?

I'll say!  But unsanctioned tapping is very unlikely to come to light.
If the police break into your house, and you find they didn't have a
warrant, you're going to file a lawsuit, there will be front page
coverage, and you'll win a huge judgement against them.  So you can
be pretty sure they'll follow official procedures before breaking in
on you.  But if they tap you illegally, you're unlikely ever to know.

A bad idea is a bad idea, regardless of its origin.  Creating a
registration requirement simply defines another new crime into
existence.  Giving the Government the keys to our ciphers and
having them promise not to use them is like Congress telling itself,
"Now, you'd better not go exceed these deficit targets, or else!"

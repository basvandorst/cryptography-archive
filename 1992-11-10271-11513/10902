	Good memory that is sufficiently selective during a trial
	makes it possible for those who accumulate information to 
	avoid the due-process search which is expected when people
	accumulate things.

	Do you see what is wrong with this sentence?  Think about it.
	Then . . . repeat after me: Information is not a thing.  
	Information is not a thing.

	It will still be impenetrable for law enforcement in the
	case of criminals.  Unless you make the "crime" of an illegal
	encryption device (ie. a computer with th appropriate software) 
	comparable to the most heavily punished felonies recognized by 
	the law criminals commiting those felonies will use it and they will 
	consider the risk quite acceptable.  The only people who will be denied
	the right to some privacy from big brother will be decent
	law abiding citizens.  I don't understand why you can't see
	this.  Is it really that hard a concept?!?

1. Inncocent until PROVEN guilty.  That is his constitutional right.  Maybe you think that it is a bad policy, but it is (supposed to be) a right in this country.  If you want to debate this, it wouldn't belong in sci.crypt so I'll do everyone a favor by just leaving it at that.

2. Right to remain silent.  Again, it is a (supposed) constitutional right that citizens are not required to testify against themselves.  I see no reason why that should not extend to one's private papers.  I believe that, on balance, this right is a good thing (and, like (1) above, this isn't the place to debate the rights of the citizens).  I see encryption as a means of protecting that right from a hostile government (even paranoids have real enemies).

This thread's been going on for a while, so I'm trying to be brief here...  The bottom line is that if people do not agree with (1) and (2) above, they will likely be hostile to the use of cryptography as a means of protecting these rights (and for you logic fans, you'll note that this does NOT imply that if they agree with (1) and (2) then they will support cryptography).  

Consider how would you convince someone that a "bad" person (like, say, Ronald Reagan :) should be allowed to say what he likes if that person doesn't accept free speech to begin with.

	Some how I've lost the reason this thread got to this state. I'll go
back over the comments and my followups. Let's see what are my points...

1) registration of crypto keys is a violation of a natural right to privacy

2) the constitution is not to be discarded at all on any point

3) the use of the child molester example to support the registration of crypto
keys is bad logic because the emotional impact clouds reason

4) A person who has first hand experience with the threat of a child molester
would not worry about the defence of non-registration of crypto keys but would
think more about KILLING that molester oughtright. (this comes from the
fathers and mothers in my area that I've talked to. Non of which would actually
do it)

5) the effectiveness of law enforcement in finding the molester, bring the
molester to the justice system, and preventing the molester from escaping their
prison are much more important than regestering crypto keys

6) the effectiveness of the judical system in placing the molester behind bars
for the length of the sentence is a total discrace and is much more important
that registering crypto keys.

7) I call it an intelectual game because the prop of the child molester has
little to do with crypto keys except the emotional appeal. And if those of you
who use this line of reasoning stopped and thought what you would feel should
your son/daughter become a victim you would realize that those crypto keys rank
at the very lowest on the scale of things that the government should/could have
done.

Case in point: Westly Allan Dodd (our molester/murderer) says that all this
could have been prevented at any prior time he was in the judical system had
he not been released early form his prior molestation CONVICTIONS and had he
been forced to complete the court MANDATED treatment programs. In short the
criminal justice system does not work for whatever reasons and the registration 
of crypto keys will not have any effect on that.

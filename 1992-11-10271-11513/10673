As always we discount what we don't understand or happen to like.  
I see nothing in the article that indicates his system is not
keyed.  System generated and embedded secondary keys provide
exactly the appearance described.

Myself, I'm particularly fond of keyed systems that refuse to 
generate to the same encryption pattern each time!  Personally,
suspect that his friend may well get to keep his money!

On final note, perhaps we FLAME new thoughts and ideas far to soon!
A more little tolerance might just encourage more exchange of new
concepts which is what I thought this group was all about!


Take care

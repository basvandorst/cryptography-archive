To do this, there's a need to take away these magic words like "child
molesters", "pornography", "drug users", "child pornography" and so
on.

In Finland I think I would have little trouble with this example, as
"child molester" is not one of the magic words here.  Neither is
"pornography" or "child pornography".  "Drugs" is, and even that's an
import from USA.  In USA, you can legally steal all possessions from
anyone if you say the magic word "drugs" - in Finland you can keep
someone arrested a couple of days.  "Family values" is a recent
example of a magic word that didn't work in USA.  Something quite like
it did work in Germany a few dozen years ago.

The magic words only work if we let them.  Break the spell of the
magic words.

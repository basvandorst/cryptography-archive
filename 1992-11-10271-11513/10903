I don't accept that.  I could not care less, if you want to give up your
*own* freedom, but I have a huge problem with your denying them to others
just because of your own fears.

Besides, such a ban does not give you the protection you seek.  For
instance, Washington D.C. denies the freedom of law-abiding citizens to
obtain handguns legally.  Yet, its murder rate is the highest in the
country (~80/100,000).  Compare that to, say, Colorado Springs Colorado
where a resident of that city can walk into any gun shop and purchase
any gun that's there, and walk out with it -- no waiting period, no FOID
card, no registration, nothing.  Yet the murder rate there is ~4/100,000.

Ah, then the danger really isn't the firearms themselves, but rather in
*how they are used*.

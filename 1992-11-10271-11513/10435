I'd like to mention another problem.  A group here at Iowa (mostly
lbrintle@uiowa.edu) is working on a nice authentication and secure
communication protocol for the gopher system.  This protocol uses
dynamically generated random keys that are distributed at run-time.
Clearly, establishing a key registration system for such keys would
be on the verge of crazyness.  Furthermore, eavesdropping on the
channel between two clients of an authentication server is not
necessarily sufficient to expose the key -- separate "wiretaps" on
the client to authentication server channels might be needed for
this.

I would hate to take a nice authentication protocol and mess it up
with hooks to make it "wiretappable".

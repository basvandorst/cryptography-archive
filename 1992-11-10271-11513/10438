On a related note :

The dept of justice proposed wiretap backdoor would require that the
government be able to monitor telecommunications from a remote location.

Does anyone know if the proposal would require that they be able to 
selectively tap into any lines they want (policing themselves doing sop
only under court order), or if the telephone companies would be allowed
to enable the remote tap only for specific numbers once presented with
a court order?  Also, if tapping is done from the remote location, is
the local telephone company permitted to retain an audit trail of the 
tap (not the contents; just what number the government remote monitoring
facility tapped and when)?  Such an audit trail would help provide a 
disincentive to "extra" goveernment taps, especially if the phone
company would be required to provide this audit trail to you unless
the government could produce a copy of the court order within 48 hours of
your requesting the tap audit trail on your phone.

	Thanks William, This is just what I wanted to say.

	Let me add that at this period of human history we have the lowest
ability to keep our personal actions and communications from the 'governments'
than anytime ever. For DaVinchi just writing backwards was enough. A simple
cypher worked for the Ceasars, Face to face through a messenger was good for
Kings, Barons and merchants in the past. But now through technology (think of
Enigma) our ability to keep to ourselves has eroded to only face to face in
with great care. RSA is needed.

regards, Ethan

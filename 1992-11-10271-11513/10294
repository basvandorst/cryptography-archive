Channels such as printing presses?

I disagree.  You could argue that saying something in the air makes
air particles move - you could probably even invoke the interstate
commerce clause by saying that since air particles influence each
other some particles in another state probably move because of the act
of speech and this has an effect on interstate air particle commerce.

Gee, wonder if I could patent the idea and get royalities when the
Supreme Court starts using it.

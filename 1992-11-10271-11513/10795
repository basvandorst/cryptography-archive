Well, if the algorithm used for encryption is not revealed,
there are several problems, including the following:

1) It's not worth the effort to try to crack it, since an
   analysis of the algorithm is a much more efficient way
   of spotting obvious weaknesses, while at the same time,
   the first attempt at diciphering something encrypted with
   an unknown algorithm might require a substantial effort,
   even if the algorithm is weak.

2) If the system can't stand up to attack, even with the
   encryption algorithm known to the attacker, then it is too
   weak to trust.

3) A person would be foolish to use an encryption product whose
   algorithm is unknown, because the provider might have a way
   to always see cleartext.

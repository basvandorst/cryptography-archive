If my memory serves me -  Hayhanen system didn't have a SINGLE null.
Basically it's monoalphabetic substitution followed by two irregular
columnar transpositions. What gives it strength are:
	1) Substitution's done via straddling checkerboard.
	2) All the keys are generated using pseudo-random sequence,
	   which in turn differs from message to message (and it's
	   based on a truly random number which is added to the
	   final ciphertext in prearranged place).
	3) Second transposition has D-areas, which mess things a lot
	   for a cryptanalist.

It really depends! (:-) [Unless you meant transposition alone.]
Substitution+Transposition is the strongest combination! (:-)

I would assume one-time pads are still in use both here and there.
But it is convenient to save one-time pads for the top guys, while
lesser folks can get almost-unbreakable mnemonic system!   Neat...
But nothing can really beat one-time pad! (:-)

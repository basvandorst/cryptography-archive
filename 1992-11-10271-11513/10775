Agree with the latter, but not the former.  You have no duty to assist the
police (under hardly any circumstances); if the police try to open it, and
thereby destroy the contents, you have a probable claim for damages against
the government, rather than there being any charge against you.

It's still illegal.  Courts have found that damages caused by a "legal"
search are still illegal acts.  (However, you'll probably die before you
collect.)

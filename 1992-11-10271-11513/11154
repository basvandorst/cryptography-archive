 I am very sorry!  The system I'm using is not a regular USENET 
 site; it carries Fido conferences as well - the e-mail is not 
 announced, it must be specifically searched for.  But if I conduct 
 a search, it starts to search every Fido conference (and USENET
 newsgroup) looking for e-mail.. sigh. Maybe I haven't configured 
 it right or something...  In the process of reading newsgroups, etc.
 I often neglect to search the "true" e-mail cubicle... sorry.  
 My fault.  :-)
  
 I went looking for your message and found it, as well as some others.
 All those who wrote e-mail to me should be aware that it seems kinda
 public here... at least, I can read some e-mail addressed to others, 
 so I assume the reverse is also true... don't know for sure how it 
 works.  In any case, you might as well post publicly to me!

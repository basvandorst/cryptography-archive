In my judgement, not a heck of a lot.  But, there is one large thing that
is still true.  There is not a single, central, know-all computer that
knows itself or knows how to find everything about you.  Not every
organization yet uses the Social Security number, although I suppose I can
see the day where they do.  In theory, cross-correlation by SSN is
legally limited, but as time goes on, it may well evaporate from neglect.

My German friends can correct me, but I believe their equivalent number is
pretty much open to universal use.  Here, it is more like a "convention" and
not a few businesses and even government agencies cannot or choose not to
use Social Security numbers and instead assign their own.

Basically, we aren't supposed to have a universal number, although it seems
clear that those who need one are finding a way of working around whatever
laws we have.  The main point, though, was at least we have them.  In the
case of public cryptography, having laws (or, lack thereof) would be a
complete success as compared to laws against universal identifiers, which
obviously can be gotten around to a greater or lesser extent.

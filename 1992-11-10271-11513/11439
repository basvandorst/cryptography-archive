I read the AP story and Gilmore's post, and nowhere were the titles of
the documents mentioned.  From the AP story it sounded like Parts III
and IV of Friedman's Military Cryptanalysis.  The AP story also mentions
that they total about 1000 pages, which does not sound like Friedman
parts III & IV.  Anybody have any info on this?


If it is Friedman, I wonder how many people will actually read the whole
thing, and what they will gain from it.

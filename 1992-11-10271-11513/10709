It might be that the U.S. is already too screwed up with weird
judeo-Xian guilt/hate for a ban on handguns to result in anything but
pandemonium. See? I'm a reasonable guy. I'm willing to fall back
to the position: "In any *reasonable* society, this would work..."
Like, perhaps, the majority of other western societies.

Oh, that's alarmist talk. There are plenty of other countries
with a ban on handguns of which one wouldn't say the population
is being oppressed. There are plenty of countries of which you
*would* say it. But you certainly can't claim any causal
relation.

Hey! What did I just say? :-)

Whoa! Now you're talking on a whole different plane. Care to elaborate?

Remember, we're talking about kids finding Daddy's gun, here. 5%
sounds to me like a lot less than the present percentage, and in
the terms to which I'm so valiantly trying to limit the discussion,
that's a Good Thing.

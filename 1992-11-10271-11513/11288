Speaking as J. Random Citizen, I'd certainly like to know which Highly
Placed Administration Official defined these objectives for you.

Before PGP, this assertion may have been true. Now, it is true for
some values of "sufficiently inconvenient." What about when I can just
press a button in my mail agent to send encrypted mail? Quite a bit
more convenient, and not hard to implement.

Of course, the fact that the "government is not greatly worried"
contradicts the Denning Protocol. Exercise for the reader: which of
these two statements of government concern do _you_ find more likely
to be true?

One of the major reasons behind the lack of cellular encryption might
be the relative cost of cryptographic equipment for analog
(=expensive) versus digital (=cheap) networks. Of course, the NSA
didn't have anything to do with it. Just ask Phil Karn :)

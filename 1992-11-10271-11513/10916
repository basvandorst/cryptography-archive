   I'm new to this group, so I apologize in advance if anyone's asked
   this question before:


   What is the current state of Canadian Law involving cryptosystems
   and encryption of messages?  I know this is a broad question; I don't
   want the full legal text, just a general description of where things
   stand.  Please e-mail responses (if there is enough followup interest,
   I'll post what I get).

   Thanks in advance,

       Andrew

Yes, but the USEFUL key registry registers PUBLIC keys, not private keys!
There's no need to make registration mandatory, because those who want
to participate in various protocols requiring a public key registry
will do it voluntarily.  They might even be willing to pay money for it,
just like businesses do for yellow pages ads in phone books.

There will probably be little incentive to bribe the key registry employees
for information, since it will be available for minimal cost.  (I can't see
an online directory query for someone's email address and key costing
more than a few bucks to be a viable service).  There might be some 
incentive to bribe employees to put phony information INTO the database.

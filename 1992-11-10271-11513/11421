   And if You are not outside of U.S. patent law, I dare you to just ask
   PKP for a license.  Then come back and complain.

I wasn't sufficiently clear.  If I were to make a useful widget which
uses RSA encryption, what can PKP do to prevent me marketting it
everywhere except the US?  I've still got 95% of the world's
population and over 50% of the global economy to sell into.  (I don't
know the real figures for the US's fraction of the economy but I
assume that Europe and the Pacific countries total to more than the
US).

I stand by my claim that my market is more open because of US software
patents.

Can anyone explain whether it is legal for a US-owned and controlled
corporation's European subsidiary to make devices which violate the
RSA patents, said devices to be manufactured and sold *only* in
countries where those patents are invalid.  If that is the case, I
accept that my market might be less open.

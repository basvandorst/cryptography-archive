You are discussing the act of padding an encrypted text so, that there
are no peaks in any statistic whatsoever. How about encrypt the whole text,
analyze character-frequencies, and sequences of characters, and then pad
the text in predefined places with characters that flatten the peaks or create
wrong peaks in some sorts of statsistic you would like to apply ? As long as
the opponent does not *know* you have added these pads, perhaps this will
work ?
Other ideas ?

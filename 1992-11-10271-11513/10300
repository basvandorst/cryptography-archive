Here in Canada, we have a saying that "a liberal is a person who doesn't
really care what a policy is about, just so long as it's compulsory".

Anyway, are there any conceivable situations in which a person or organization
might wish to _voluntarily_ register private encryption keys with a trustee?

Two examples come to my mind: the first being where business A has a 
strategic plan involving the use of business B's software.  A wants to
be protected in case of B's possible bankruptcy, and so they insist that
the source code be encrypted, with the decryption key deposited somewhere
safe.

A similar situation might arise in the case of an author who leaves private
decryption keys in the hands of a literary agent.

Arthur L. Rubin asks if sources to RSAREF are available, and worries about
the possibility of a "back door."

Yes, the sources are what RSAREF is. ripem beta testers, for example,
need to compile RSAREF before compiling ripem.

I have not checked the sources personally, so I can't rule out a back
door, but they are there for anyone to check.

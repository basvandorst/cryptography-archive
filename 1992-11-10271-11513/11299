I would like to endorse P. Gladstone's proposal (without fully
comprehending all of his questions).  It is a fine piece of work.  It should
reduce the level of noise in the forum.  It should be instructive to novices
and conservative of the time of the mentors.  It should require little
else save accuracy to recommend it.

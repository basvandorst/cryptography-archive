Well we have put a lot of non-violent offenders in prison. But we
are releasing many violent offenders all the time. Some 90% of
those convicted of violent crimes are repeat offenders. Now they must
have been released if they were on the outside to commit those
crimes. We are NOT keeping the violent offenders locked up. Studies
have shown that the chances of doing significant time for a violent
crime are VERY low.

What a wonderfully PC term. Did you come up with that one yourself?

You have a source fir this I presume. Also consider that you are even
MORE likely to be blown away in DC where handguns are banned.

Completely irrelevnt.

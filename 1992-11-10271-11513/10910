Mathematics would also be placed in a surprising position by P=NP.
P=NP implies that there is an algorithm which, given a theorem
expressed formally in ZF, say, and a number n, either gives a formal
proof of the theorem of length at most n, or shows that there is none,
and which would take time bounded by some polynomial in n. It wouldn't
*necessarily* put us all out of the math research business, but....

   In all the posts I've read about PKP's patent claims over RSA public
key encryption, I have never seen anyone mention when the patent is due 
to expire.  I was under the impression that U.S. patent protection is only
good for 17 years (I believe that's true for drugs, anyway).  RSA papers
go back to the mid 70s.  Is RSA going to be in the public domain soon?
   I've seen posts to this group quoting from PKP's patent.  How about if
somebody checks when it was filed?

Thanks
Joe

It has a Militia clause.  More specifically, it has a "well regulated
militia" clause.  A well regulated militia is an armed people - it
isn't an organization controlled by govt.  See Fletcher's Political
Works, pub'd in 1749.

The importance of the militia clause is that it is to subordinate govt
military power to that of the armed people.

You can't have an armed people without an individual right to keep and
bear arms.

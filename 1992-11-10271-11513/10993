Go for it.  Name a country in the EC that has gotten significant
benefits from gun restrictions.  Show the before-after data.

If that's ALL Gontier is talking about, he can't show a benefit
because that sort of thing is in the noise.  Given that, there's no
way to show a benefit.  Since his proposals are extremely expensive
....

A band-aid addresses some problems.  It doesn't address others.

What problems does a gun ban successfully address?  Gontier seems
to think that crime won't be affected, and there aren't any other
big problems.  Maybe a gun ban will cure baldness....

Why is Gontier so sure that the band-aids chosen will leave him alone?

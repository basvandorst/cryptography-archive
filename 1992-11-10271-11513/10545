How many movies and cartoons have there been in the last few
decades glorifying Drano? How many do you expect there to be?
How likely do you think it might be that a child understands
that Drano is a poison? The very reason you use it as an example
is that children sometimes eat it because they *don't* know.
So no, I don't think we should regulate Drano in that context.
Pick another example. Try kitchen knives. I've got an answer
for that one, too.

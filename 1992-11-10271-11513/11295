No, the problem is convincing enough people that they need such a
thing.  Face it, most folks don't think anyone's listening in on their
calls (obviously -- or cordless and cellular phones wouldn't be so
popular).

*Some* businesses realize it.  Most don't.  And until the market is
big enough, there won't be enough economy of scale to drive the cost
down.  Persuade people that they need such phones; then, you might
see some demand.

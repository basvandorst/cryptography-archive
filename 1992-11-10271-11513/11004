Steve Gardner attempts to dismiss those who object to the thought police
of political correctness with:
"Its a red herring and it is usually used to batter people into
        being silent on issues of racism and sexism."

Baloney! Anybody who has read the many specific examples in "Illiberal
Education" or in Schleschinger's book (no right-winger, he) knows that
this is a serious disease on campuses throughout the country.

Many who are neither racist nor sexist object to this thought policing.
The thought police cannot get away with blaming the victims for their
criminal fascism, no matter how often they repeat this big lie.

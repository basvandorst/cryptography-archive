   Hypothetically say I have all my data encrypted with 'mega-DES ]I[' - how will

   court had the papers they need, etc).  Would that be perjury?

The proper phrase is
	"I refuse to answer on the grounds that it may incriminate me"
Unfortunately, if you're accused of "crimes against the state",
like failing to register your keys, that argument is tougher to use.

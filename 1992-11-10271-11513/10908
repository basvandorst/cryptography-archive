Err...maybe he ment the 4th amendment: "The right of the people to be
secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable
searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall
issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and
particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things
to be seized."  
"Your honor, we want to fish through Mr. Drum's correspondence because he
is known to communicate with known adgitators and subversives"

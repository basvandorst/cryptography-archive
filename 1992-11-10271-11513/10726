I posted a follow up to another thread (about why GCHQ monitors (it is
claimed) US comms more than any other nation's), that I believe there
is nothing illegal for friendly countries to exchange intelligence

comms; neither is it illegal for GCHQ (under British law) to monitor
the US.

"Law" need not be a cover.  It is generally easy to circumvent the
intent of a law without breaking it.  Financial advisors also have a
great deal of skill at this, for instance.

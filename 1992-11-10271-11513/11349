We get upset about it for a couple of reasons:

1. Expense.  If they don't bother trying to enforce it, it's useless.
   If they do, it ties up a tremendous amount of law-enforcement time
   and money (paid for by our taxes) and is still useless for stopping
   the dangerous criminals.

2. Principle.  Not to keep harping on the same theme; but it's been shown
   time and again (at least to my satisfaction), that if you give gov't
   power which can be abused with little or no accountability, they *will*
   do so, sooner or later.  Look at the so-called war on drugs.  In the
   name of an allegedly good cause, we have had some laws passed that if
   I had been told about 10 years ago, would have laughed and said "they
   could never do that here!".  We're having enough problems keeping our
   civil liberties from eroding any further without this kind of nonsense.

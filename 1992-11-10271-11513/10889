   Not now, no.  Someday it may be too late to try.

 The point is that such a law could put you in jail if you cross it.
 Any view that such a law would not be good for society must be
 *made*, and not just *assumed*.

 Long ago, and far away, a guy I knew in high school had the same
 idea.  He was selling dope out of his house and "dating" the
 underage daughter of a local muckety-muck when she got off school
 every day.  He said, "What can her old man do about it?"  He said,
 "The police couldn't find their a__."  The last I heard, he was a
 "three time loser" doing hard time in the state pen.

 Betting your future on the incompetence of authority is a fool's
 bet.

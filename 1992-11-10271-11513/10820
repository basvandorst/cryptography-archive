The point is, if he doesn't, you nail him on *that* charge instead!

The thing is, there are people in the world who are less careful than they
could be.  They don't even use encryption, but they *do* use a computer.  
They just change all the filenames.  There *are* some clever ones who do 
pretty much what Terry Ritter suggested.  His scenario isn't so far out, 
IMHO.

On the other hand, the idea that every criminal has access to and regularly
uses some kind of vault complete with a self destruct mechanism . . . that's
maybe a little less likely.

Actually, I make no claim to know what YOU'RE talking about, either.
In fact, now I've forgotten what we were talking about . . .

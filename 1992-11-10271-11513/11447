Wasn't there a big brouhaha a couple of years back that said that Ashton-Tate's
copyright of DBase was invalid, because DBase had been developed with public
funds?  Seems to me that this would be the case here.  The RSA algorithm was
developed at MIT with public funds.  That would make it, in theory, public
property.  PKP was set up, it seems, to cheat the American public out of what
is rightfully theirs, but they have everyone running scared, so it probably
will not be tested in court for some time.  So they get away with theft,
and try and screw the rest of us out of what is legally ours by intimidation.
Doesn't seem right to me - but, then again, I'm not a lawyer.

I welcome replies on this matter from representatives of PKP.  If they stand
up and tell me I'm wrong, fine.  If they tell me that RSA was not developed
at MIT using public funds, fine.  But I don't think that's the case.

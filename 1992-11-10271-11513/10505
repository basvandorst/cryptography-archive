	Okay. I'll use an XOR with a one time pad.  When the government
	guys ask me for the key I will then produce a key that makes the 
	encrypted text decrypt to: "Hi Mom.  Loved your apple pie.
	How's uncle Jim.  Love, Stevie.".
	
	By the way, you sound like you approve of the government minding
	everyone's business.  I hate to find fault but gosh that 
	attitude offends me.  I think it would have offended those who
	wrote our (US) constitution too.  They, unlike you, didn't trust
	government to not become corrupt and therefore fall into the
	hands of a few. Our founding fathers knew that the few would use 
	the powers of government to arrogate the resources of the
	many to serve the few.

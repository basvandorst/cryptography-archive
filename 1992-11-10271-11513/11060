Since you have decided to do some reading, check out the Codebreakers
by David Kahn.  It has plenty of examples of how algorithms are
discovered.  For instance, I suspect that your friend would disclose it
for one million dollars.  Therefore, the assumption that it will never
become known is almost certainly false.  If the program is distributed,
it can be easily reverse engineered.  I have reverse engineered programs
that did encryption in the past, including the internet worm, so I have
proof by example there.

I hope that you do not think that I am calling you names.  I am trying
to explain the facts of cryptanalysis to you, but you are free to
believe whatever you want.

Well, seeing as we have not heard from your friend, there is no
way for us to judge whether he is up on the technology in the
field or not.  You have given us no indication that would suggest
that he is, and one that would suggest otherwise.

Well, I have bad news for your friend.  It is fairly unlikely that
he will gain much by trying to commercialize his algorithm.  It is
much easier to convince somebody to buy a DES package, as you can
point to the fact that it is a government standard that has been
approved for safeguarding the banking data in the US.  Now, if it
does public key without infringing on the PK Partner patents, then
its a different story :-)

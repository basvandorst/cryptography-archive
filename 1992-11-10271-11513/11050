Provided you use it in compliance with their license.  PGP doesn't.

They told me that they would be happy to sell a license to Zimmerman,
who created PGP, but not to individual PGP users.

Are you sure it's not illegal to import it?

How do you read the following sections of the ITAR:

123.2 Imports.

No defense article may be imported into the United States unless (a)
it was previously exported temporarily under a license issued by the
Office of Munitions Control; or (b) it constitutes a temporary
import/intransit shipment licensed under Section 123.3; or (c) its
import is authorized by the Department of the Treasury (see 27 CFR
parts 47, 178, and 179).

Part 127 - Violations and Penalties - states in 127.1 (a):

(a) It is unlawful
    (1) to export or to attempt to export from the United States
        any defense article or technical data or to furnish any
        defense service for which a license or written approval
        is required by this subchapter without first obtaining
        the required license or written approval from the Office
        of Munitions Control;
    (2) to import or attempt to import any defense article whenever
        a license is required by this subchapter without first
        obtaining the required license or written approval from
        the Office of Munitions Control;


125.2 Exports of unclassified technical data.

Paragraph (c) reads:

(c) Disclosures. Unless otherwise expressly exempted in this
subchapter, a license is required for the oral, visual, or documentary
disclosure of technical data to foreign nationals in connection with
visits by U.S. persons to foreign countries, visits by foreign persons
to the United States, or otherwise.  A license is required regardless
of the manner in which the technical data is transmitted (e.g., in
person, by telephone, correspondence, electronic means, telex, etc.).

Also, 120.21 Technical Data.

"Technical data" means, for purposes of this subchapter:

(a) Classified information relating to defense articles or defense
services;

(b) Information covered by an invention secrecy order;

(c) Information which is directly related to the design, engineering,
development, production, processing, manufacture, use, operation,
overhaul, repair, maintenance, modification, or reconstruction of
defense articles.  This includes, for example, information in the form
of blueprints,drawings, photographs, plans, instructions, computer
software and documentation. (There's little more, not relevant.)

You may be right about this. (It might be illegal in the 
People's Republic of China  :-)

I'm not either.  Therefore I would never advise someone about what they should
do with PGP.  I advised people to get their own legal advice, in order to form
an informed decision.

See above.  Do you read it differently than I do?

Yes.  Send email to rsaref-info@rsa.com

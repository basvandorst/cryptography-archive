I'm confused. It's been argued that one could refuse to furnish a key
to one's encrypted files by pleading self-incrimination. Yet one
can have one's files subpoenaed.

Can one refuse to furnish the files themselves under the Fifth Amendment?
If not, how can one refuse to furnish the key? If so, then one can refuse
the files and the key becomes irrelevant.

Either way, this discussion about furnishing keys is irrelevant. That is:
either one can refuse to furnish the files under the Fifth, in which case
the key isn't needed, or one cannot, in which case the key can be
compelled by the same authority that compelled the files.

So let's take this discussion to alt.civil.liberties.subpoenaing.files.
where it belongs, and not sci.crypt.

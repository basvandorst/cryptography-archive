         You might be right, but it isn't something I'd invest my money
in (or buy, or use for that matter).  This sounds like a product with-
out a market to me.

         I don't believe this will happen.  The advantages of seatbelts
are far more obvious to the average person, yet the only reason they
are ubiquitous is that they are legally required.

         I doubt the mafia uses phone encryption technology at all
(unless you count speaking in elliptical terms).  Some reasons not to:
         1.  The mafia likes to use pay phones.
         2.  The main danger is the other party to the conversation is
taping the call.
         3.  Mafia members are well aware that most calls are not inter-
cepted.  Professional criminals take risks all the time and tend to see
jail time as a unavoidable occupational hazard.
         4.  Using encryption technology is likely to irritate the gov-
ernment, something only honest citizens can afford to do.

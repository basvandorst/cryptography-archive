Ok, ok.  Several people have pointed things like this out to me.  But
remember the context of my comment.  We're talking about P vs. NP, and
algorithms for decision problems.  In other words, the entire point of
running the algorithm is to arrive at a single answer.  In fact, most
definitions of algorithm include the condition that the algorithm halt
in a finite amount of time.   An OS may not halt, but it's not a program
designed to get an answer, and is not in the least considered an
"algorithm" in the sense of algorithms studied for complexity theory.

I used the term "program" rather than algorithm trying to be informal,
and because it's what the original poster used.  I suppose it was a
mistake....

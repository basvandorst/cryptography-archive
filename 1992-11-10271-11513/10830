I THINK (at the risk of being corrected, of course!) that Terry is
trying to get at the very important point that it is not enough to
make up arguments that merely satisfy people around sci.crypt.

Anarcho-libertarians tend to be easy to convince that "regulating
crypto is a bad idea."  And there's quite a lot of people of that
"stripe" around here.  The phrase "preaching to the converted" comes
to mind.  (In a related vein, a lot of the arguing lately seems to be
between different "believers" that have disagreements over relatively
minor "theological" points.)

The arguments that are convincing to libertarians may not be
convincing to more "authoritarian/conservative" types.

Those that would like to initiate new regulation for crypto technology
are likely to invoke the traditional weapons of Fear, Uncertainty, and
Doubt to encourage people that are NOT "libertarian" to support the
regulations.

It may be that examples may be brought out (terrorism, drug dealing,
organized crime, and child molestation being obvious examples that
have already been mentioned) in order to "argue for regulation."

It's not necessarily relevant to THEIR arguments that the regulations
would have little ACTUAL effect on the crimes that are used as
examples.

If people can be convinced that:
a) Bad people use crypto to help them do bad things, and
b) Good government agencies want to use crypto to do good things,

that may be enough to sway opinions to:
c) Support (or at least not reject) regulations that curb
private/unregulated use of crypto. 

I agree that a) and b) do not necessarily "prove" that c) is a good
idea.  Furthermore, I'd strongly agree that the facts do not support
c).  Many people have posted a wide variety of reasons why the
regulations would not have the purported effects.

Unfortunately, THAT DOESN'T MATTER.

The arguments that REALLY need to be hashed out here are those that
truly differentiate between reality and the FUD factor (Fear,
Uncertainty, and Doubt).

If the discussion doesn't consider the political reality, then it
won't have any useful effect.

We can talk about the "theoretical impossibility" of regulating key
management as much as we like.  If we ignore the fact that those that
actually MAKE the laws will use issues like "drugs, organized crime,
and child molestation" to try to sway the populace, then the
discussion is unlikely to have any REAL effect.

We'll be talking about something that most people neither understand
nor care about, and will have NO influence.  The <Choose Favorite
Agency> can then say "Oh no, drugs" and get the legislation passed
with little public protest.

The QUESTION that needs to be answered:

What arguments can be used that ANYBODY can understand that will show
that chilling regulations on crypto technology are a bad idea?

0) The answer(s) must consider the fact that someone may have an
emotional concern, and may need more than just "rational arguments" -
they may want to have some emotional comfort.  This is why the "FUD"
arguments get credence, even though they may not be rational.

1) An ideal argument should be convincing to someone who has no
problem with "strong government" as well as to someone who believes
the government should either be small or nonexistent.

2) If crypto technology is such a "good thing," it should be pretty
easy to come up with cogent reasons as to why it is so good.

It's obvious that crypto is good for those that are "planning
revolutions."  If that's the only obvious "market", then it's going to
be a tough haul selling the "goodness" of crypto.

Let's make up a list of "What USEFUL things can Crypto be used for?"
Privacy is, of course, first on the list.  Why not collect others
together, so that it is EASY to say, "Banning crypto has the following
costs."

3) More effort needs to be put into describing just why the
regulations would not actually affect the crimes that they are
purported to "solve."

This appears to be one of the most important reasons why the
regulations would be useless, and should be one of the strongest
arguments against the regulation.

Let's collect these reasons, and organize them together so that
they're well stated, and thus available as a resource.

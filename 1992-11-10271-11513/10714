	Then maybe it is time to tell us more about this program.
	The Number One assumption of cryptothingies is that if
	you know the algorithm, so does the opposition.  The only
	thing you can really assume to be secure is your key.
	But even this is under attack... at all times.

	Experience has shown it is safest to take this for granted.
	Does your friend know better?  Let him/her tell.

	The proposed algorithm seems to do away with keys.  Are
	we assuming right?

	a) it is a lot easier to imagine than to do.
	b) it is a lot easier to encrypt than to decrypt.
	c) theorizing is fun, doing is hard, but both
	   require solid knowledge.

	There is a tendency to resist the inkling of an idea
	about a whisper of change in this newsgroup, but you
	will punch through if you really have something to say.

	The problem is not that the "experts" can't do it; it is
	that the "experts" could not care less.  You have not managed
	to give them enough of a challenge...  or enough of a reward.

	You are mistaken, if only because you have kept the
	product hidden.

	You are so right about this.  But does it always
	mean that rejected ideas are automatically valid?

	Then it must mean the problem was not laid out in a
	clear fashion, or that it was misrepresented.

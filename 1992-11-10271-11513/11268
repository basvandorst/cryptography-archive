Two questions that occurred to me while reading your batch of responses
to questions/posts/flames/etc.  

1)  Can your system be used to broadcast messages from multiple sources
to multiple destinations?  For instance, A B and C are the sites.  A
can send a message to B, or C, or B and C.  B to A, or C, or A and C.
C to A, or B, or A and B.  If your programs self-modify to keep up with the
current key or whatever-you-want-to-call-it, would not they all have to 
be in lock step with one another to be able to decode messages?  Thus, if
A sends a message to B, and then a second message to B and C, C would be
out of step and would get garbage.  

2)  Do *you* think it is likely that someone could crack your plaintext if
they knew your algorithm?  (This would obviously include algorithms that
hide the key in the message as tracing the program would reveal how it
is hidden (to be safe I'll add an "I think" to that!))

3)  As for the flames on both sides, ah, never mind...

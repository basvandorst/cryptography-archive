That's unfortunate, if true.  They'll have to get busy guessing what the
suspect might have used as a private key for IDEA-encrypted keys.  The same
would apply to raw DES or IDEA.  It doesn't have to be PGP.

However, that has nothing to do with you as a BB source for PGP.  I hope
you gave the official a copy.  With that, your job is done.

PGP shares no guilt in child molestation.  If the suspect had committed
something to memory and that was the only thing which could convict him,
then he goes free, according to our Bill of Rights.  If he goes free,
then he is not a child molester (according to the law).

Encryption gives me (or even a molester) the ability to record information
as securely as if it were in memory -- because the key is in memory.  If
the owner forgets it, for example, then whatever was encrypted is lost to
the owner.

And, to repeat, PGP is not an issue here.  This applies to *any* secret-key
encryption algorithm -- publicly available or personally invented.

 See kids, this is what you get into if you post to the network:
 People will question your intelligence and impugn your integrity
 in a mad rush to move the discussion away from a telling point.

 I suspect that Jim's case was *the basis* for my hypothetical.
 As I have said before, I got the information from a guy who had
 talked to someone supposedly having this sort of investigation for
 real.  I simplified the case slightly for discussion, and avoided
 claiming it was real because I had no first-hand knowledge, and
 because I saw any claim of reality as being irrelevant to the
 discussion and needlessly manipulative.

 For the purpose of discussing the issue, it really doesn't *matter*
 whether the case is real or not.  It certainly *could* be real, in
 which case some part of our society will not be overjoyed with the
 new world order of widespread strong cryptography.  *This* is the
 issue we need to face.  It is much *easier* to cast aspersions, of
 course.

 While being *accused* of a crime is not the same as having been
 *convicted* of a crime, it is not quite the same as not having
 been accused, either.  For one thing, the authorities can take
 the accused into custody, and investigate his or her "effects"
 in an attempt to *collect* the necessary evidence.

 You might consider watching a few US cop shows to improve your
 background for this discussion.

 As for files being "hearsay," they can probably be submitted as
 evidence under the testimony of being found in the accused's
 "effects."

 Maybe s/he erased it, or kept it on a floppy which was discarded.
 Maybe it's a box with 500 other unmarked encryption programs.
 Who cares why?

 Well, if "they" find the enciphered file on the accused's computer,
 and it has something to do with a crime, they probably could
 introduce it as evidence.  Do you think it would be difficult to
 introduce a paper diary describing crimes?  Why would it be
 different with a computer file?

 It is always within the power of investigating officers to
 manufacture evidence.  I am not aware that cryptography has an
 effect on that.  If it does, that may be *another* problem we
 have to worry about.

 I dunno.  Do you?  You seem to be making or inferring accusations
 with almost no data at all.

 *Has* this "placed a chill on PGP distribution"?  I doubt it.

 What it *has* done is brought before us the possibility that
 absolute cryptographic freedom may bring with it dangers which
 we did not previously expect.

 Maybe.  But, again, it really is irrelevant whether or not this is
 a real case.  It certainly *could* be real, and, inevitably, *will*
 be real someday.  Eventually, we will have to deal with it.

 The *topic* has scarcely been addressed; what was "beaten to death"
 was whether it was *an appropriate topic*.

 Since this sort of thing *will* happen, we *still* need to consider
 what we will say when such an incident is used to support calls for
 a total ban on the public use of cryptography.

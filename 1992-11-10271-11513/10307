This thread gives me the willies.  This is all just another example of our
power-mad out of control Guv.  

Has nobody considered that this type of restriction would also be a violation
of 1st amendment rights, not to mention the 9th and 10th amendments?

And how shall our lovely Guv make its determination of who is in violation
without themselves violating our 4th amendment rights?

And what about persons that decide to send large randon bit streams from
place to place?  What happens to them when the Guv demands the key and there
is none to produce?  Will they likewise make the transmission of random bit 
streams illegal, or will they pass into law their right to assume that any
stream that *appears* random is in fact an encrypted message and subject to
the laws governing same?

This whole idea  defies credibility.  Why in hell doesn't the Guv just outlaw
breathing without a license?  Shit.

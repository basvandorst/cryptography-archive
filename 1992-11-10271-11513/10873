What all of this ``plain-text'' issue may mean is that there is an
additional incentive for the development of more advanced means of
accessing data, ala hypertext, and the like.

If you start transmitting data around in such a "value-added" form, it
may be that lawyers/judges won't be capable of reading it in its plain
text form.

If the plaintext form is incomprehensible to the average lawyer, and
there is no "simpler representation", then it's no big deal to release
the plain text.

This is also an argument for using non-"standard" spreadsheet
software, or something just incompatible enough with Lotus 123 that
your "plaintext" spreadsheets won't read properly into most peoples'
PCs.

And it doesn't even directly involve any actual encryption...  Wow, I
should consider taking a patent out on "hiding data by using software
features not found in Lotus 123, Excel, or Quattro Pro."

This is fast becoming a(n) FAQ!

Still here goes:

There are lots of implementations of the basic step of most Public Key
Algorithms (namely Modular Exponentiation) in hardware. There are a
copule by Cylink (Stateside), there is one (now defunct) by GEC-Marconi
Secure Systems here in the UK, there are a couple by Belgian and Dutch
companies, and there are several that have been designed by research
labs (including UMIST, partly by ME!).

Other public key ciphers include:

El Gamal, Diffie-Hellman, Fiat-Shamir.

For more details, mail me.

I think perhaps there are two reasons for this:

1. The patent protection frightens potential users away. The fact
   that a license fee needs to be paid to use the system eats into
   profits. Here where RSA is not patented (probably due to the
   prior publication rule for European patents), it is more widely
   used. Though still not incredibly popular.

2. It is slow! A decent private key algorithm can be used to encrypt
   bulk data much quicker. That means PK algorithms are limited to
   message authentication and key exchange.

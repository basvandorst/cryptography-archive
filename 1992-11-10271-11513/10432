Well, I checked it out. Here are the results:

The Netherlands has no law banning or regulating encryption. The justice
department is thinking about it but it is in its very early phase of
lawmaking. (Some people asked me if there is regulation regarding privacy:
there is).

They also tell me that in the EC there is some movement on this issue. But no
laws yet.

The Law in France that was mentioned earlier has been published but it is not
an acting law yet. They first have to regulate its implementation, something
that is not trivial. So it is still free to use encryption in France.

The person I spoke with was very interesting in info on the discussion that
was going on. Pointer to articles are very welcome.

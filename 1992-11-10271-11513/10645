Can someone tell me how these digitally encrypted phones provide
reasonable security in light of the following problem.  Phones lines
can tolerate raw data rates of 9.6 kbps whereas voice requires 
64 kbps.  Let's say the CELP compression reduces the voice
requirement down to 9.6 kbps (voice becomes noticibly choppy thereafter).
Where do they allocate the bandwidth needed for sycronization and error
correction.  Assuming the phone uses a strong block cipher such as DES
in code book mode (stream ciphers would have error propogation problems)
this would imply blocks of duration 6 seconds.  An uncorrected channal bit
error would result in white noise for 6 seconds.  Voice is redudant but
NOT that redudant.  From this discussion, either you increase the signalling
bandwidth through use of multiple phone lines or ISDN, or you improve
compression technology or you use a weaker cipher.  Perhaps someone can
post the specs for one of these digital encryption phones which I've
never come across.

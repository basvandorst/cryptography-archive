	Perhaps but free speech DOES apply to the electronic media.

	Strict constructionism is a strategem used by those so called 
	"conservatives" who want to let technology obsolete the constitution.
	They don't really believe in the principle of free speech and they 
	are eagerly awaiting the day when everyone communicates through 
	media other than word of mouth and then they can so encumber 
	speech (vis-a-vis the norm) that they effectively control it.
	The important thing about speech is the communication involved
	not the medium through which it is accomplished.  Those who would
	deny this are actually hostile to true freedom and are afraid of
	the new and alien ideas that freedom brings.

	Right.  And if you fall for this your freedom as well as mine is
	in danger.

	*Even* strict construction has limits?  Surely you mean
	*especially* strict construction. ;-)

	That would be a fine argument Mr. Shearer if what the sentence meant
	were: "People who give up freedom for security lose it irretrievably".
	However, the sentence means: "All occurences of trading freedom for
	security result in loss of both."  At best you might wish me to modify
	the sentence to "Most occurences. . . "  But thank you for your kind
	history lesson. ;-)

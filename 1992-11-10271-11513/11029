 Assuming for a moment that use of a "key" was as important as some 
 say, why do you think the NuCrypt does NOT use one? The fact that 
 some guy just speculated so? Risible gullibility on your part.

 What if the NuCrypt executable could be varied so that each pair of 
 copies were different from, and incompatible with, every other pair?  
 Just a suggestion. There could be others.

 Nope. It didn't.

Here in Chicago about six weeks ago, a Cook County Sheriff's Deputy was
charged with selling weapons illegally to gang members.

I don't have confidence in _your_ ability to drive a car without
endangering my life.  Please call the DMV right now and have your
license revoked.  Similarly, I don't think you can be trusted with
knives.  Please dispose of all your kitchen equipment.  Etc., etc.,
ad nauseum.

Fine.  I have used my guns well over 100,000 times, but I have yet
to kill _anyone_ with them.  Maybe I'm doing something wrong?

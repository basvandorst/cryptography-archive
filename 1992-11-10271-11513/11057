Well, technically this is not a "known plaintext" attack that you are
offering.  The idea with a known plaintext attack is to recover the
key, not part of the plaintext.  This sort of misunderstanding on your
part is what is driving the reaction that you are seeing.  Sorry to
be so blunt.

See the comments above.  Same problem.

Well, I have.  You did not respond to my email, although I have no
way of knowing if you received it, but I have received no responses.

Well, he is getting closer to the point were somebody is going to take
him up on it.

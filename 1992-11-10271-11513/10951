A lot of it depends on auxiliary info: how did you intercept it, and what do
you know about the correspondents?  Does your traffic analysis suggest that
they'll be using a high-level diplomatic cipher, or maybe a field-grade
tactical cipher that's likely to be done with pencil-and-paper or
unmodified calculator?

OK, suppose you don't know anything about it.  Frank Lewis says you should
*look* at the ciphertext and see if there's anything weird about it.  A
lot of people will just start throwing tools at it.  Is it in 6-letter
groups instead of the usual 5?  Is it totally missing J's, or Q's?  The
former might suggest a fractionating system, the latter a Polybius-based
system.

Do a frequency count.  Do the frequencies match your expected target
language?  If so, you're probably dealing with a plain old transposition
cipher.  Are they as rough as the [some?] target language, but different
values?  Maybe it's straight substitution, or maybe substitution with
transposition.

Do an index of coincidence, first on the ciphertext as-is, then on the
ciphertext broken up into periods.  Does it peak somewhere? E.g. if you're
expecting English, do you see the IC for the as-is ciphertext at .066, or
is it stuck down near the .033 you'd expect for random 26-letter text?  If
it peaks on one of the periods, you've got a periodic cipher, and can
start with a whole bunch of *other* tests.  Do a digraphic IC -- if that
peaks as English (or French, or whatever) would, maybe you've got a
Playfair or other digraphic system.

If you've got multiple captured ciphers, slide them against each other and
look at matching letters.  Are there more matches than you'd expect if
they were random?  If so, it may be a long-period system, but these
messages hit an overlap -- this was helpful in the PURPLE analysis.

And then there's crib-dragging, helpful in attacking many ciphers.

And so on and so on -- all driven by the stuff you've found out before, and
revisited as you go down false trails and then back up to something you
thought you'd eliminated.

And, of course, all these methods are 50 years out of date.  I have no clue
as to what's *really* going on inside the classified places, if anything.

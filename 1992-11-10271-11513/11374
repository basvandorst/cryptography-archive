        Singapore is moving in this direction, with the government running
the credit card system, and with vehicle transponders reporting car locations
to bill for road usage.  How's it working out?  The technology has been
deployed for 2-3 years now, and it's time to hear more about it.

        Credit cards for low-value transactions are coming.  Some US
fast-food outlets have tried it, but the transaction cost is still a 
bit high.

        Most supermarkets out here now take VISA/MC, as well as debit cards.

        Auto dealers are now required to report purchases of cars with
over $10,000 in cash.  Banks have been required to report large cash
deposits for several years now.  

        Cash in large amounts is dead as a mechanism for legitimate
transactions.  

        Interestingly, the objective of "money-laundering" is to get money
out of cash and INTO the banking system, where it can be moved around the
world quickly and anonymously, hidden in the huge flows of money taking place
electronically.  This suggests that further effort to clamp down on the
usage of cash would be misdirected effort.

Because your key depends *totally* on the starting value. If the
"enemy" knows the *system* (which they will, sooner or later), then
once they crack *any* message they can read them all. 

Output from *any* "generator" depends on input/starting values. So
*those* are the "key". And for a "brute force" attack *they* become the
"key space" that needs to be searched. So I just feed all the 
starting conditions in and see which ones give reasonable messages.

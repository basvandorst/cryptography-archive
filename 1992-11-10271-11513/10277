Gerben Wierda posts an anti-American distortion, viz:
"since the U.S. has the habit in trying to export its views all over the world
through economic pressure".

Nonsense.

If it is a "view" then people accept it voluntarily or not at all. Nobody
forces anyone else to buy Coke.

If it is a rule of fair trade according to U.S. lights, then it is not a
"view" but a ground rule. One is free to ignore it, in which case one
isn't entitled to the benefits flowing from trade with the U.S. That
is no more "economic pressure" than saying that if you won't play
Poker by the rules, I won't play with you. The Bulgarians (to take
Wierda's example) aren't entitled to steal U.S. software with impunity,
and thus the case of insisting that they honor accepted standards
of copyright protection or not get U.S. copyright material is not
"economic pressure" but simple justice. They can choose to continue
to ignore such standards without penalty, but aren't entitled to the
benefits of our property at the same time.

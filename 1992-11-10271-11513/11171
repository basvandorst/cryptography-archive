Really?  Well, since "very, very few" is a somewhat ill defined concept
in mathematics, I can't even disagree with you.  Do you mean
- "there are fewer than M algorithms (programs) that cannot be counted
  on to halt" or
- "there is a possibly infinite but countable number of algorithms
  (programs) that cannot be counted on to halt" or ... ?

I not only have seen one, I even have written one, albeit unintentionally.
By the above statement, this probably makes my a special person in some
sense -- if only especially stupid, maybe ;-)   (Then again, I seem
to recall other people telling me that they found out that they had
an endless loop in their program.  Oh, well ... )

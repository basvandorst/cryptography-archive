Let's move the firearms half of this discussion out of sci.crypt;
I've re-directed followup-to: talk.politics.guns.
I'm rabidly pro-second-amendment, in spite of not liking guns,
and I agree there are distinct parallels, but any attempt to discuss
guns-and-something on the net seems to turn into the usual gun flames.

Let's keep sci.crypt and comp.org.eff.talk for more related topics,
like factoring big numbers and smashing Big Brother :-)

			Thanks;  Bill

   I stopped reading at this point.  If the above was a foundation on which
   to base future comments, it is too flawed for further consideration. 

Yup.

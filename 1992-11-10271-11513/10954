        Once you get past doing those little substitution ciphers
        in the back of crossword magazines, what becomes interesting
        is algorithms. For a method to be used, it has to be
        published (knowingly or otherwise, since dissassembling
        programs is duck soup these days). For an encryption to
        present a challenge, it has to be robust under plaintext
        attack when the attacker has a copy of the mechanism.

        Whether he is just being cute, or thinks he has patent
        possibilities, the sad fact is that the only way Erik's friend
        will get anyone's attention is by publishing his method.

        There may be a way out: He can claim that the method is the
        key. In that case he should publish the technique used to
        generate a very large number of cryptographically different
        methods. I've already proposed something very much like that
        in this group, which (strangely|sadly) didn't stimulate any
        discussion.

        Cheers,

                Marc

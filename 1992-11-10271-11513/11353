Or, similarly, commercially available products like the program
PCSecure, which is part of PC Tools, can "Shield" a child molester.
(Of course, since it uses DES, then it's breakable.  Or is it?...)

I mention this because PC Tools, unlike PGP, is a software package
that an enormous number of PC Drones^H^H^H^H^H^H I mean
Lusers^H^H^H^H^H^H I mean Users already have installed on their
computers.

"Forbidding" in any essential way the use of crypto would essentially
require that anything like PC Secure be "taken back."  Which could be
even more of a difficulty than taking PGP out of circulation...

Which is the all-important goal of this whole process.  To make sure
that the arguments are heard, and not merely brushed off as "computer
nerd radical stuff."

Another classic case where people get harassed a lot is if a child
dies.  If it's not OBVIOUS that it was some sort of medical condition,
the parents will go through the grill.

They essentially are asked to PROVE that they didn't kill the kid.  If
they did, it may be impossible to prove their guilt.  If they didn't,
it may be impossible to prove their innocence.  One of the reasons for
"Innocent until proven guilty," but it doesn't necessarily work...
Innocent people may have gone to prison over this one...

Important point!  The punishment is supposed to fit the crime.
Cryptography isn't intrinsically a crime at all.

And how about an executable program?  Does this mean that only source
code can be transferred about?

How about your financial spreadsheet.  That .wks file certainly looks
like an encyphered version of the spreadsheet, doesn't it?

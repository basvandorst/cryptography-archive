This is now hopelessly far removed from sci.crypt, so please heed the follow-up.

Here's a little aphorism that I wrote months ago:

"An environmentally clean Earth is a waste if there remain no free people to
appreciate it."

A free person is one whose personal choices have not been supplanted by
"collective decisions".  In other words, if the only way to achieve "fresh air,
water and the like" is "regulations imposed by federal, state or local
governments", then there's no point in the fresh air or water in the first
place.

If the environment is to be saved with human dignity intact, it will have to be
because enough people take personal responsibility for it.  But civilization
cannot survive continuation of the currently ascendant paradigm of democratic
political government wherein archists wield nukes and use them to "impose" upon
peace-loving non-participants everywhere.

        Relations among people to be by mutual consent, or not at all.

And more.  It means that if a foreigner (from the US point of view)
establishes a corporation in his own country which participates in
exporting US-patented crypto technology from the US to other countries,
the US might conceivably come and snatch him, bring him to the US, and
try him under US law.

Can you say "Manuel Noriega"?

While that comparison may seem far-fetched at present, I see no
difference in principle.  And although a crypto-violator may be small
fish compared to Noriega, the crypto-violator would also be much easier
to abduct.

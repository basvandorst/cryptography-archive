Nice sarcasm.  Anyways, I guess I should have specified DES in cipher
feedback mode.  No little 8 byte blocks. :->

Nope.  I was just using DES as an example, since its output in CFM is
unpredictable as well as statisctally random.  The real question was: If
you have a good enough PRNG (or try URNG - unpredictable random number
generator), why is a pseudo one time pad bad?

Yes, but DES (and even RSA) aren't perfectly secure.  They're just
computationally secure.  Only (so far) a true one time pad (based on some
natural random process) is perfectly secure, right?

If I were really going to use it for encryption, I'd do just that :-)

I must be missing something here.  I agree with what Terry says but if I
were to have a copy of a plaintext message to Terry and were to encrypt it
with his public key, just how would I go about making such plaintext plain
again WITHOUT his secret key even if I wanted to for any purpose.  In other
words, even if I maintained a copy of the original plaintext message, how
could I prove it was what was encrypted using, for example, PGP.

Is this a problem?  And if so, what is the best way to approach it.

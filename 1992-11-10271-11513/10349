I'm not sure just what Jerry's reasoning is.  If the Fifth Amendment
protects a suspect from being forced to reveal an encryption key
*after* he is suspected of a crime, why does it not protect a
non-suspect from being forced to reveal an encryption key *before* a
crime has been committed?

If you are going to ignore constitutional rights before a crime has
been committed, why not wait until after the crime to do so???

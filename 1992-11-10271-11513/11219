The question may be not so much one of whether cryptography should
be legal as whether any attempt to make it illegal could *ever* be
enforced.  Personally I believe that attempts to suppress it are
doomed to failure.  The reason is this: it is simple to devise a
*code* (not a cipher) in which *any* incrimininating message can
be made to appear as an innocent one.  In the example above, it is
*particularly* easy, because the information does not have to be
transmitted to anyone else; thus the alleged criminal can use a
keyword encoding scheme which will be meaningful *only* to him;
and the key associations will exist *only* in his mind.

For example, I can display my things-to-do list:
	Buy 2lb of carrots at Safeway on the way home
	Wash car
	Send card to Auntie Elsie
	Service bicycle
and *only* I know that this can be decoded:
	Buy     2lb of carrots  at Safeway         on the way home
	Collect 2kg of cannabis at London Heathrow car park 2
	Wash      car
	Wednesday afternoon
	Send card to Auntie Elsie
	Meet         usual contact
	Service bicycle
	Sunday  morning

I just made this up on the spur of the moment, so it's a very simple-
minded example.  If I really had something to hide, I might put a lot
more effort into it.

Some of simple tricks I have used:
	Plausible local places map to signicant locations;
		Safeway -> LHR, Tesco -> LGW, etc
	Mention of mode of transport -> when event will happen;
		the initial letter of the verb gives day-of-week,
		bicycle -> morning, car -> afternoon, etc
	Many-to-many mappings; e.g. any aunt (I have six, so I
		won't use the same one too often) -> the usual
		contact *for this activity* (NOT Elsie->John
		Smith, Edna->Fred Bloggs, etc).

So key registration is utterly irrelevant; if I were hiding information
for my own use only from the police, they wouldn't even realise that
there *was* hidden information; and if they did they could never *prove*
that they had correctly cracked my code.

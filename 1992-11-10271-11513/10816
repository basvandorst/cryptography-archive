You still insist upon ignoring my point.  You appeal to protection
from demons to justify your proposal.  However, you refuse to
address the question of how your proposal will protect us.  

Instead, you assume that because the demons are so large and
threatening that some (equally ineffective) restrictions will
be placed upon the use of cryptography and that your restrictions
are less onerous than others.  This too is argument by appeal
to demons.

I stipulate the following:

1) there are demons, monsters, and ogres.

2) people have an inordinate and irrational fear of said
demons, monsters and ogres.

3) history shows that even otherwise well intentioned 
bureaucrats and politicians will pander to that fear.

4) crypto can, at least at the margins, grant aid and comfort
to demons, monsters, ogres, pinko commie faggots, and others
of evil intent.

5) your proposal for infringing my freedoms is, at least
marginally, less onerous than outright banning of all public
use of crypto.


Now, will you address how your proposal, or even a total
ban on private communication, reduces the aid and 
comfort to the demons, monsters, ogres, pinko, commies, and
other villains?

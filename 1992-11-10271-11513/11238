HI,
	For a project I am working on I will need to be doing some
sort of fast encryption skeem (sp?), and was wondering if anyone would
have some pointers on how I might use a FWT to accomplish this?  Is
there a nice way to do it based on some sort of key idea, or am I
approaching it from a completly wrong place.
Thanks,

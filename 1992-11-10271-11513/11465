Well, I know little about probabilistic attack, so I can't argue.
But I tried to estimate the probability of key recovery, if an
adversary can have 2^47 chosen plaintexts encrypted on my
machine, assuming I change the key after N bytes of data
encrypted by it. Of course I could screw up arithmetics
somewhere, but...

Having 2^47 ciphertexts with:

no key change - probability of key recovery 1.
key change  every 8 MB -                    0.632  (still more than 0.5)
            every 1 MB -                    0.0001 (not too threatening)

Honestly,  I didn't expect it to be t*hat bad* for 8MB case, but still,
the numbers don't quite show, that "FREQUENT key change isn't adequate
defense".  Nor do I see, why every 2^47 ciphertexts one key should
emerge - if keys are indeed changed OFTENLY.

Comments? If I'm wrong - where?

Oh, sure.

I'm not aware of Crypto-92 being published yet. Is it?

DS3 -- sometimes known incorrectly as T-3 -- refers to a 45M bps digital
channel.  When used for voice, it's typically divided into 672 channels
of 56K bps.  I forget where the signalling is done, in the stolen bits
from the 64K clear channels, or in dedicated channels.

I don't know for sure if the DS3 inter-office trunks are encrypted.
I had thought that only the were signaling channels were.  And
without that information, it's awfully difficult to pick out the
voice channels you want to listen to.

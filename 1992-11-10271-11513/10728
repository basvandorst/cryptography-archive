 Are you serious?  I don't smoke, and rarely drink, yet i would strongly oppose
banning them.  The US already tried banning alcohol, and all it did was to allow
orgainzed crime to make a fortune.  
 I will defend your rights, even your right to do things with which i personally
disagree, AS LONG AS YOU DON'T ABUSE THEM!  If you do, i expect that you will be
punished for that abuse.  In return, i expect the same consideration and respect
from you.  In summary, i believe in personal liberty.  Society is not homogenous,
and we cannot reasonably expect one set of standards to fit all people.  We should
however, expect all members of society to be held responsible for their actions -
which seldom seems to be the case today.

Do you feel the blood of innocents on your hands every time you pick up a 
kitchen knife?  Drive a car?

Because its important to make the destinction between the people who are obeying
the law (excersising their rights in a responsible manner) and those people who
are disobeying the law.  Sort of like making the distinction between people who
are using a bank in a lawful manner, and those people who rob banks.

                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
So you are only talking about accidents?  Do you realize that the total number
of firearm accidents per year is ~1400, and the situation you describe is a
subset of this number?  BTW, falls, drowning, fires, poison, and choking all
are responsible for more deaths per year than firearms accidents.  As an aside,
the accident rate per capita has been steadily falling for years.

 We don't have the time to waste on band-aid cludges.  If we start addressing the
real problems now, we can hope to eventually fix them.  If we keep wasting time
with band-aids, we'll never fix it.

Actually, the Swiss goverment is much older, seems to be quite democratic, and
(BTW) allows ownership of firearms that we can't legally own in the US.

 So, if you had a leak in your plumbing that floods your basement, you'd band-aid
the problem by buying a sump pump?  It would address a problem (water in the 
basement) but wouldn't actually do anything about the real problem (that hole
in the water main),  
 To go back to your "mature system", how many band-aids (temporary fix cludges)
have later caused yet another problem, resulting in another band-aid, etc..  how
many times have you heard the argument that "if we'd fixed it right the first 
time, we'd not be seeing this problem now"..

 What about when the proposed band-aid fix hits something that you care about?
Maybe a band-aid to free speech - you know the type, to prevent offending others,
all free speech must be approved by the FSA (Free Speech Agency) before use..

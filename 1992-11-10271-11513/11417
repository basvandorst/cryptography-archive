OK -- so I shouldn't have stressed the word "weak".

It has to be medium strength -- just strong enough to defeat the
intelligence services of all governments except our own.  :-)

However, I still claim that key registration is *weaker than* weak
cryptography -- because Joe Mobster doesn't need any cryptanalysis to
defeat it -- just an offer the registration person can not refuse.

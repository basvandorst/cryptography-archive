Summary: DES stream encryption code needed


I need a code or a site that has a code for encrypting individual 
(8 bit) characters on the fly using DES. I have the code
for block encryption(64 bits) so don't give me that. This is needed 
to a project I am working on and is greatly needed.

Thanks in advance!

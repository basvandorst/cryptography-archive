 Again, apologies for any (unintended) offense, but I feel a strange 
 sense of incongruity here.  I mean, youse guys are supposed to 
 thrive analyzing crypts (oops!), so here I go and offer you a simple 
 little crypt to analyze (ouch!), and y'all rise in flames and thunder
 and throw bolts at me!  Zeus himself would've been proud of this 
 display of outraged divinity..!

 Why?  Isn't THAT exactly what cryptanalysis is all about? If you
 can't break a simple, little ONE ENGLISH WORD encrypted among
 hundreds, with lots and lots of help, what CAN you do...?

 You don't know that  (1) it has no key or  (2) it has a key or  (3) 
 it is useless or  (4) it is not useless.  In other words, you don't 
 know ANYTHING about it, because you haven't seen it.

 You speculate a lot... Yes, there IS a friend, and he HAS written
 the thing, and it DOES look interesting. But no, the system will
 not be published, since that would mean giving it away. We were,
 however, interested in having its *output* looked at by some
 professionals, if we could find some willing ones.

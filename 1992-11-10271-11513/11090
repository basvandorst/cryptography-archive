Another related weakness of transposition ciphers is that
multiple annagramming may be possible on a single message,
due to regularities in the transposition.  If there are
no regularities at all, we have a key as long as the
message and thus a sort of one-time-transposition.  For
messages longer than a few tens of characters this would
be unbreakable, but less convenient than the equally strong
ordinary one-time cipher.

There has been a number of fairly recent results contradicting the random
oracle conjecture. Basically, these results indicate that the "statistical
evidence" from the random oracle is not very reliable. The results include
IP=PSPACE, MIP=NEXPTIME and others (these theorems are false with respect to
random oracle with prob 1, but true in the absence of oracles).

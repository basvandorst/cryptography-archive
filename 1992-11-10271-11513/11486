    Mr. Eichler, I suspect you are engaging in criminal activity and masking
    it by your use of encryption.  You are hereby ordered to cease all use of
    encryption, and provide to this court proof of your innocence in this
    criminal activity.

This is what the 5th Amendment is (among other things) supposed to protect
us FROM.

Under such an arrangement, those of us whom the power that be would like to
supress, can simply do so by fabricating sufficient evidence to convince a
judge that there might be criminal activity, shifting the burdon of proof
before defendable proof by the accusation could even be processed.

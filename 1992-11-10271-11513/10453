For that matter, if I was the defendant, and I'd been using some sort of
"one-time pad" (ie a system where the key length is the message length,
and keys are not re-used), I'd have my lawyer demonstrate that *any*
text of the same length as the message could be extracted from the code
by selecting an "appropriate" key. 

That would *guarantee* "reasonable doubt" unless they picked some *real*
dummies for the jury.

So ciphertext generated with a one-time pad *isn't* going to be *usable*
evidence unless they can *prove* what the key was. And if they can do
*that*, they can just as easily get the original plaintext to use as
evidence.

Any legal types care to comment?

    Hmmm.  I have lots of guns.  And I use them all the time.  And I've
    never killed an innocent person.  Hell, I've never even killed a guilty
    one.  So it seems like your founding premise is wrong, and everything
    else that follows is therefore suspect.

    Seriously, your statement has been proven wrong so many times and in so
    many ways that I'm amazed that people can still repeat such things with
    a straight face.  Every year in the U.S., more crimes are halted by
    armed, private citizens than by all the police forces combined.  The
    last time it was officially counted (several years ago), that was more
    than one million instances.  And in better than 99% of those instances,
    no one was hurt -- most of the time, merely drawing a gun on the
    criminal is sufficient to thwart the crime.

    Further, gun-control and violent crime have a very close correlation.
    Those areas of the U.S. where gun control is relaxed tend to show a
    greater than average decrease in violent crime (violent crime, in
    general, is decreasing every year across the U.S.).  Those areas that
    enact more draconian gun control tend to actually increase their crime
    rates.  And, those areas that have never had gun control lead the most
    peaceful lives of all.

    I could go on, but this is not the appropriate forum, and I apologize
    for the misuse.  I just couldn't let such a blatant piece of
    misinformation go by without comment.  If the person to whose remarks
    I am responding wishes to engage in civilized discussion for the purpose
    of understanding each others' position, I'd be happy to exchange e-mail.

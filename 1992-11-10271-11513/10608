David Sternlight * In most  of the world  cars have been  registered for
                   many  years, yet  no democratic  government has  used
                   that as  a way to  confiscate cars (except  for those
                   used in law violations).
                                 = = =

  Bad analogy (IMHO).  Having your car registered does  not mean that it
  can be searched without your permission. Where as with registration of
  private keys  the possibility exists that  your private messages could
  be  read at  will without  your permission  and/or knowledge.  Totally
  different scenario.

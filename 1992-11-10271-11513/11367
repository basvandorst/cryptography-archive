First, my appologies for getting your name wrong in my prior post.  I
don't know how I did it, but I appologise.  

On to the analysis.

Well, there is an aliasing kind of problem.  Just as in real text,
there are multiple occurances of "the".  However, if you have three or
four or five messages of the same length, the other fragments won't
fall on nice boundaries and this can actually help out.  It is harder,
to be sure, but you do eventually win.  We are probably not even 
talking about double the effort, however.  I've done a little of this
in my time and find even two or three texts work out pretty well once
you get that first correct fragment put together.

In short, the padding may slow you down.  But, not enough to notice.  It
_is_ nice to make it algorithmic and so not burden the legitimate users.
And, a restricted lexicon is indeed easier because there are more "the"
type words to find.

No, it doesn't really affect the probabilities much.  Think about it.
Take any random fragment of this note and take a random fragment of
another.  Whether you start at the beginning, the middle, cut and
paste a few paragraphs first, it will merely change "which" common
three letter groups line up.  Besides, you can actually start with
two letter groups if you wish.  That's a different set of trade-offs,
but you can't optimize against how large a group the attacker chooses.

If I understand the point, we are departing from pure transposition and
beginning to introduce a little substitution.  If the shorthand is
a fixed, user-driven function, then all that has to be known is how the
shorthand works.  If it isn't part of the "key" (that is, does not vary),
it is no different in practice than learning that English rather than
French is used.  On the other hand, if the shorthand is somehow varied
by some sort of key, we have left transposition ciphers behind, albeit
slightly.

Remember, too, that sometimes a partial break is sufficient, so only a
little bit of shorthand may make no practical difference.

You are quite welcome.

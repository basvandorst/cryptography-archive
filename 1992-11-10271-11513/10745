I think that this whole business of making unregistered keys illegal is
somewhat foolish.  I would regard governmental restriction on the use of
cryptography (including making it useless by requiring keys to be divulged)
as intolerable.  However, a court can simply demand access to either keys
or plaintext the same way it demands any other information.  Refusal to
comply with the demand constitutes contempt of court.  If you think that
the court's demand was unjustified, appeal it.  I don't believe a new
policy is required in order to deal with our hypothetical child molester.

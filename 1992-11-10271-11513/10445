That's not true at all.  Rather, it's not true for most types of
cryptosystems.  Consider DES -- as far as the non-classified world
knows, it's immune to known-plaintext attacks.  Even if you run DES
in output feedback mode, generating an XOR stream similar to what
the original poster asked about, the *key* is the 56 bits you fed
into the DES engine, not the output from DES acting as a cryptographically
strong random number generator.

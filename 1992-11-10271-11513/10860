    Dane, do you happen to have a working implementation of the DES handy?
Good.  Now, make a file of ASCII 0's and encrypt it with some key.  Lookee,
Lookie, you get a list of random bits!  64 BITS LONG, to be exact, and the
same list is repeated for the length of the ciphertext file.  That's a big
reason why cryppies don't use BLOCK CIPHERS like the DES for one-time-pad
generation.  Of course, it would work fine if you limited your messages to
a length of 8 bytes... ;-)
    Using cypher-block chaining would create a more random-LOOKING bit
stream, but intuition tells me that it would have similar faults, and would
be reasonably easy to break as well (of course, I could be wrong...).
    I think you're probably looking at the one-time-pad scheme as a way of
IMPROVING on the DES.  Remember, though, that only OTP ciphers that use
truly random numbers are perfectly secure (in transmission, anyway), and
using a PRNG will always reduce this security to some degree.  To break any
encryption scheme like this, your adversary need only break the PRNG to do
it.  If this generator is the DES, then your OTP cipher scheme is no more
cryptographically secure than the DES itself.
    Finally, if you're going to use it as a generator, why not just encrypt
the plaintext with the DES in the first place, and skip the XOR step?

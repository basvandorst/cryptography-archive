    Why?  Assuming you mean public-key, the question of whether there
    exist one-way functions is not dependent on P!=NP, right?

No.  All you need is a polynomial-time method to decide if a given
key is the right one for decrypting a given ciphertext.  If you have
any info at all about the nature of the traffic (e.g., it's English
text), you can guess and verify the secret key.  The difference
is that the problem instance is a block of ciphertext instead of
a public key from which to recover the private key.

In article <1992Nov11.195934.14474@netcom.com>, strnlght@netcom.com (David
Sternlight) suggests that an appropriate response (to a hypothesized
attempt to discourage use of public-key cryptography) might be to enlist
litigious allies such as the ACLU, in the hope that the responsible
agencies would shy away from a court decision which might rule out some of
their current activities.  Perhaps.  Certainly, having allies like the
ACLU, CPSR, and EFF should be useful.  But, given the current makeup of the
Supreme Court, I would much prefer to fight the battle on an earlier front
-- if we can prevail (whatever that means) in Congress, we don't have to
worry about what Justices O'Connor and Souter are thinking today.

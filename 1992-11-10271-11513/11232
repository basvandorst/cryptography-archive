A while back I remember a discussion on searching for a large prime where
it was stated that it is better (and I cannot remember why) to randomly
generate candidates rather than just randomly selecting a starting
point and searching incrementally.  Can anyone refresh me why that is
true and how important it is?

Thanks,

Bob

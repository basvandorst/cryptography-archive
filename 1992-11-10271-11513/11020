There's nothing at all legally, morally, or ethically wrong with what you
propose.  But, I doubt if you get any takers.

First, see if you can get a minute or two from a lawyer friend.  I believe
if you mail it to a few folks, that does not constitute "publishing"
(as I recall, you can reveal patentable ideas for just the purposes we are
here discussing -- they key is whether it is "generally available" and
publishing on Internet probably constitutes "generally available" but a
few stray letters to competent collegues is probably not, but I am not a
patent laywer).  See if your lawyer friend will back that statement.

Given that, the only reason to bother with a non-disclosure agreement is to
keep the likes from me from stealing your idea if it is any good.

But, have a REAL GOOD non-disclosure agreement vetted by a good lawyer
(ie, pay money) and be prepared for a poor turnout.  I am not keen on
signing away any rights when I am evaluating something for free.  Also keep
in mind that some of us will be unable to sign even if we want to because
of what our companies have made us sign already.  That specifically includes
me, even though IBM does not pay me, per se, to do crypto.  You are clearly
on or over the border where you should think in terms of saving your nickels
to hire a crypto consultant.  But, there's another way; much cheaper.

There's no "royal road" to geometery or cryptology.  I suggest you/your friend
spend a good two or three months reading H. F. Gaines' _Elementary Cryptanalysis_"
(also seen as simply _Cryptanalysis_) and try your hand at a little 
"illicit" decryption.  When you are done, you almost certainly won't need us
to tell you if it is any good -- you will know yourself and will have merely
learned about something you/your friend are clearly interested in anyway and 
probably save yourself a lot of legal fees.

Besides, if you really, really think it might be commercially viable, don't
you owe your future customers your own, best personal "shot" at whether it
really works or not?  Were I in your or your friend's shoes, I don't see how
I could ethically maintain my relative ignorance on a topic I was about to
pursue commercially.  But, maybe I missed something.

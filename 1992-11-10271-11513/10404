With the amount of abuse of legal methods that the poolice and prosecutors have
engaged in in recent years combined with the inability of the public to have
any accurate knowledge of what efforts or cooperation are needed to tap
phones (from what I have read here and elsewhere, 
there are plenty of ways of monitoring a phone
without involving the phone company), how can the public validate Dr. 
Denning's claim that the police do not routinely tap (or monitor) communications?

There have been numerous cases reported in the papers and elsewhere of the police
fabricating evidence, coercing false testimony and confessions and other 
activities.  Many cases of prosecutor misconduct have also been reported.

Without a thorough examination of exactly what is occuring in regards to police
tapping and monitoring of communications I think it would be foolish to issue a
blanket statement that police misconduct does not occur in telecommunications
monitoring.

The problem is that the US government is trying to make it illegal to
do encryption at all. This means that the fact that the message is unreadable
is evidence to the "fact" that you are committing a crime (i.e. encrypting
messages)

This means that the only thing you could do is say hey, this is just a 
loveletter, the algorithm is this and the key is that. This is a proof 
reversal that's not a good idea in my opinion.

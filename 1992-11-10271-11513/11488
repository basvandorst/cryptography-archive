Are you sure you don't mean money order?  I have on occasion had to
make large CODs or just transfer money between two accounts (and
didn't want to pay the too-large EFT fee) and gotten fairly large
cashier's checks or bank drafts (which as far as I can tell are
basically the same, but I am not a banker).  Money orders on the other
hand cannot be purchased over a given amount for some reason.  Were
you paying for the checks in cash or getting them drafted from your
account?  Perhaps if you didn't have an account there, they were
concerned about forged money???

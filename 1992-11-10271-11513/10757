Many (if not most) crypto "products" now consist entirely of software,
and software is very easily modified and copied.  Complete source for
a few of these "products" is freely available, which makes
modification trivial.  But even object code can be disassembled,
modified and recompiled by someone with enough motivation.  This only
need be done once; once the results are distributed, *everyone* can
run it, regardless of programming skill.

And, of course, any competent programmer with a PC can write his own
package from scratch.  The reference materials are readily available;
your excellent textbook, for example.

Given this, just how would you distinguish between the "makers of
crypto products" and the "users of crypto products"? You can add this
to your long list of unanswered questions (such as exactly how you
would enforce a ban on secure encryption between private parties in
the first place).

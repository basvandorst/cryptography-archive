The fun place to shop is nic.funet.fi, in the Finnish University Network.
You can also telnet to your nearby archie server and log in as "archie"
to find out information about other archives.  (archie.ans.net is one server.)

Finland is located safely outside the jurisdiction of the NSA and 
US Commerce Dept. export laws, but other constraints may apply.
Some of the code may be resticted by patent laws in some countries,
such as RSA in the US, and IDEA in much of Europe, so you may may need
to negotiate a license if you live there.  The US forbids export of
any useful crypto software or hardware, though algorithm descriptions are ok.
Other governments may also forbid use of encryption, or may forbid
transmission of encrypted material, or may require you to register your keys.

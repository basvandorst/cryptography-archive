Paul Bell says that "i am sure that the common carriers are currently
required to encrypt traffic, at , i think the ds-3 level."  This is
the first I've heard of this, though it makes sense given the USG's
concern about Soviet interception of U.S. phone calls carried via
microwaves, some years ago. A quiet adoption of countermeasures isn't
unreasonable to expect, particularly since it is a technical measure
that infringes nobody's civil liberties.

Does anyone know more about this? What is ds-3?

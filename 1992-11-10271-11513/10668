Wrong, it would hurt.  History has proven this time and time again.
New York, Wash. DC, Chicago, all places that have banned guns and have
the highest crime rates in the country, with the crime rates rising
dramatically after the citizenry was unarmed.  History has also proven
that the first steps in oppressing a populace is to disarm them.

A handgun was designed to give short range destructive capability.
Wether or not it is used for killing someone or for punching holes in
paper is left up to the user.  A handgun is highly useful for
defending oneself in close ranges.  If defending myself means killing
someone, well, I'm sorry, but I refuse to lay my life down to the
random criminal.  Please don't ask me to give up a very useful means
of defending myself, as you have absolutely no stake in it.

It's not a good patch.  See examples of certain major urban centers
above.

It won't be a band-aid.  It would be morally wrong, and it would not
achieve the desired effect.
Even then so, about 5% of adults will carry a gun no matter
if it's legal or not.

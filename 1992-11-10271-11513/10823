The cryptographic system chosen by an organization reflects the philosophy
and technology adopted by that organization.  It reflects how far up the
mountain path of "Truth" the organization has traveled.  At the top of the
mountain are undetectable, uncrackable, totally understandable cryptosystems
that are based on fundamental, universal principles of cotion. As on
e decends from this ideal, methods that reflect an imperfect understanding
of reality, imperfect technology, and imperfect commtion, indeed, an
imperfect philosophy borne of an imperfect spirit are adopted by an organizat

of dictators are compared to cryptosystems of democracies, and cryptosystems
of terrorists.  I think that even if you can't immdeiately crack an unknown
code, this type of analysis would tell you much about the philosophy and
predisposition to deception and other assumptions the crypographer was making
about his advesaries and his audience.
Any comments?

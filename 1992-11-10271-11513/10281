I can not prevent the government from seizing my property.  I can sue for
proper compensation, I hope, but I can't prevent the seizure.  I can't even
prevent the government from seizing my person, via arrest although I can
sue for false arrest.

However, I *can* refuse to let the government pry something out of my mind.
I have a right to refuse to testify.

In some cases, I might be found in contempt of court, perhaps, or of
Congress, but if I claim that I don't remember, the Gov't is not empowered
to administer drugs or hypnosis to force me to remember.  [I assume this is
still true....]


If I have encrypted information on a floppy disk, the government can seize
the floppy disk, just like it seizes my other property, but to view the
information encrypted on that disk, the government needs something from my
mind.

To me, this means that the dotted box around my mind has been extended to
include the information on the floppy (although the floppy itself is
property and not part of my mind).


So -- is intellectual property (the contents of my own mind or encrypted
notes I keep of my thoughts) seizable by the government?



What if there were real telepathy -- just between two individuals, not
allowing either of them to read toughts in others?  Would such
communication be illegal because it can't be tapped -- or would it be
protected by the 5th Amendment because it occurs only in the minds of
citizens?

Hi folks,

In FAQ (Version 1.0 draft 1e), RSADSI talks
about DES and diff. cryptanalysis (page 35).

	Specifically, they say: "........This attack
	requires 2^47 chosen plaintexts, i.e. 
	plaintexts chosen by the attacker.
	Changing the key frequently is                       <----
	not an adequate defense, because
	the attack tests each possible key                     how
	as soon as it is generated during the                  can
	attack; therefore the expected time to               these
	succeed is not affected by key changes (as         coexist
	long as the chosen plaintexts are always encrypted   <----
	under the current key).


Now - it surely looks like manure to me. If I change the key,
all you've done with your chosen plaintexts is supposed to go
down the tube  and you have to start from the very beginning,
or at least this was my understanding. Am I wrong on this?

How can it be possible, that the expected time to succeed is 
not dependent on how often I change keys? Assume I have a 
counter, which automatically demands a new key as soon
as 2^20 bytes are encrypted with the current one. How
can such a scheme be vulnerable to diff. cryptan?

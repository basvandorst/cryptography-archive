On what do you base this assertion? In hardware, key scheduling need
take no time at all. In software it can be made to operate in roughly
the same time as a single encryption. I have code that when executing
on a Sparc1 takes 60 or 50 microseconds for key scheduling or
encryption respectively.

Yes, key scheduling takes longer, but not significantly so as your
posting seems to suggest.

It has been tried - and has failed dismally wherever it has been tried.
What is different about your proposal?  And it CAN (and does) hurt.
While I said evidence was lacking as to the efficacy of such measures,
I didn't mention the lacking of evidence showing deleterious effects.
Those abound.  Primarily because gun bans tend to GUARANTEE those that
prey on others the safest environment possible.  They are assured of
the fact that their potential victims have no meaningful countermeasure
- especially if the criminal teams up with a partner or two.  That pretty
well neutralizes any effective resistance even the most athletic can
provide.  And gun bans make SURE that the elderly, physically
disadvantaged, etc. are rendered as helpless as possible by denying the ONLY
meaningful option available to them (short of just staying behind heavy,
securely locked doors, of limited value if you have something the attacker
wants).  These folks often don't even have the option of running.  But
perhaps the elderly and physically disadvantaged should just get out of
the way to make room for the Beautiful People anyway, right?  I am being
cynical because these folks seem to be never considered when these
'wonderful' remedies are proposed.  When they are considered, the 'options'
offered to them usually consist of enhanced dependence on the STATE or
reduced freedom of movement - both unacceptable, IMO.

Could it be possible that what determines a good band-aid measure is that
it does not impact YOUR lifestyle (but its ok to impact others), that
while it puts others at risk, since it has no effect on your level of risk
since you allready opt to not make use of firearms, it is a good one to employ?

Perhaps it is because you simply don't like guns, that you wish to deny
them to others, REGARDLESS OF THE COST?

Still haven't explained why I should be penalized for the irresponsible

I missed the post....

Please outline why you feel it is a good patch, seeing as it doesn't
work, even a little bit apparantly, and only makes life safer for
the criminal element.

#define SARCASM 1
#ifdef SARCASM
We can't address the underlying problems because:
   1: It would involve some work, and offend those with money and power.
   2: It doesn't have media support, and lacks that 'flair'.
   3: It doesn't limit availability of coercive force to the elite.
   4: It wouldn't address the real goal - denying everyone access to
	  a tool one just plain doesn't like, and thus wishes to impose
	  their preferences on the population at large.
#endif
#undef SARCASM

In short - reducing crime and violence has nothing to do with it.

If it is because you just don't like guns, and wish to ban them regardless
of the cost, say so.  But please don't pretend you want to ban them because
it will make us all safer.

See above for what I think the reason is.

But that would require EFFORT, and the possibility of not being able
to find any real evidence to support ones agenda.

Because some things are worth spending 1000 hours on and others are not.
If you can break the Banks crypts, and can guarentee yourself
10,000,000/year, 1000 hours is worth it. However just to show you that
your method does not work isn't. Now if you can convince a major bank to
use your system, I'm sure your challenge will get lots of takers. Mind
you they may not tell you when they've got the answer. 

For any good crypto system, that one english word difference means that
the two cyphered texts sill be essentially totally different. If your
friend's isn't, then it probably isn't woth looking at in the first
place. If it is then the job is difficult.

    I  have been  reading this   newsgroup for  several weeks  with keen
    interest. And  for one am in  favor of the privacy  that it permits.
    However, recently (yesterday) I had  the opportunity to speak with a
    law enforcement official who had quite a different view.

    He was calling  from California in order to pick  up the pgp program
    from us. Seems that they are on the case of a molestor who encrypted
    his information using PGP. If they  can't crack it the molestor will
    more than  likely walk due to  lack of evidence. This  has caused me
    some  concern   because  we  have  agreed   (volunteered)  to  be  a
    distribution site  for PGP (logon as  PGP USER pw: PGP).  Yet, I for
    one would hate to think that there is anyway we could help such scum
    in receiveing PGP or similar encryption technology.

    At  this point  I am  curious as  to what  others think.  Both about
    distribution  and about  it's use   by the  underworld. I  have read
    'Dennings' report  and though I  disagree with it  on several points
    this particular  case does raise some  real-life issues pertinent to
    the discussion. If a  law was to be passed (and you  can bet that if
    cases like  this one in particular  continue one will be)  how would
    you like it to read?

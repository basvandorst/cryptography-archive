As many have pointed out, and as history has shown, "registration" is only a
prelude to confiscation.  Further, should it become desired to confiscate,

confiscation possible.

It is not possible to confiscate firearms, as an example, unless you know
where they are.  The same holds true for crypto keys.

If a crime is a crime, then it IS.  Why would the use of cryptography be a
factor in the punishment that a crook faces?

It means that the US (and most other gov'ts, if push comes to shove)
can and will do what they damn well please, if they think it suits their
needs.  Its against the law?  They just pass another law to make it OK.

While I doubt if they would go to the hassle to grab someone for making
a crypt package available, if they (govt) really want someone they will
just go and snatch them.  Or terminate them.  The worst that would ever
happen over it would be some nasty speeches or name-calling at the UN.
Perhaps threats of sanctions or embargos if the offended country is
REALLY pissed.

Very few countries will consider much more than that unless person is
a big shot in the country, like a ruler, prince, or major industrialist.
And even then only if they considered the cost of more a more drastic
response worth it.  Hence, the hot air at the UN.  Lots of breast-beating.

Welcome to planet earth.

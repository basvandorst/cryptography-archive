The answer is simple:

1.	learn cryptanalysis and practice it, by breaking a couple of systems
	similar to the one you're proposing (but obviously simpler :-)
	as well as ones which have been broken in the past (eg., Enigma,
	Hebern, pencil-and-paper methods, ...).

2.	if you still believe it's a good system, enlist the help of
	someone even more talented than yourself.  Get a non-disclosure
	agreement signed by that person (preserving your patent rights)
	and possibly pay the consultant.  Get the consultant's expert
	advice.

3.	file the patent, both in the US and abroad, simultaneously.  (Don't
	just file in the US first and refer in the foreign patents to the
	US application -- file full disclosures overseas -- possibly even
	a week or two before filing in the US -- to prevent a secrecy order
	being placed on the patent application).

4.	publish the idea.

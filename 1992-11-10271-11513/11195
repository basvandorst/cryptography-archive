Try to convince the person - I'll call him him - that witches, demons,
ogres, communists, drug dealers, drug-crazed Supermen, terrorists
and other purely evil liveforms don't exist.

It would help a lot if you had a common acquaintance who is one of the
witches, communists or terrorists.  Like for example a neighbour both
of you knew and who seemed like he was a nice enough guy, up until the
police came and confiscated all his property telling you he was a drug
dealer.  Or a satan worshipper, or a child molester.

Perhaps it would help if you had smoked some pot in high school with
friends.  Then you could take yourself as an example - tell him you
once shared a joint with a friend which you bought, putting the money
together, so you're technically a drug dealer.  Ask him if you look
like one of the evil drug-pushers who make millions of dollars who
need to be locked up just on suspicion and the key thrown away.  Ask
him if you look like one of the witches who need to be tested whether
they float.

Never mind if you haven't ever smoked pot.  A big percentage of people
have - it's plausible.  Just tell him you're one of those he wants to
be locked up.

Better yet, make him realize he's one of those witches himself,
perhaps by using his favorite vice and telling him about the people
who think all people who have that particular vice are
satan-worshippers and should be locked up and the key thrown away.

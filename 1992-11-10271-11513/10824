I think you are discounting time value here.  The cryptologists who
hang out here are probably not terribly interested in carrying out even
a known plaintext attack on something encrypted with an unknown
algorithm -- they just don't have the time to waste.  They would much
rather look at and analyze the algorithm in order to assess its
characteristics (security, speed, patent infringement, etc.).

To assert a NIH attitude is absurd, given that there is no _here_
here.  The problem is that neophytes show up with "unbreakable" code
challenges in sci.crypt on a regular basis (about every other month, or
so).  Nobody has the time to reverse engineer an algorithm starting
from square one -- it is a long, tedious process, the first time
'round, unless the code is ridiculously trivial.

If your friend is truly interested in having experts assess the
security of this algorithm, s/he must submit the _algorithm_ to the
experts -- not the _output_ of the algorithm.

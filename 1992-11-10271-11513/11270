It would have been better written as:

"Now, in the ordinary course of business, there will be several messages
of the same length which share the same cipher key.  In a real, working
example, it is impractical for all messages to have their own key.
There may well be unique messages that have no other message
with the same length, but we start with those of the same length.  
What follows will tend to work even if the length of the real texts vary;
the only issue of interest is that the overall length is the same and that
the transposition step is performed _after_ the padding."

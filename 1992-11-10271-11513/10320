An obvious loser of an idea .

All you have to do is register one key, then use another.  If you are really
doing something illegal, they won't know your substitution until after they
begin investigating the something illegal.  So, this might help prevent
crimes which are less serious than violation of the cryptology statute,
but not anything more serious.

So, unless they are willing to make the violation VERY serious, like a 
capital crime, it is unlikely it prevents much crime, and especailly
not the kind which they usually use wiretaps to investigate.

This fundamental flaw will prevent the registration of crypto keys,
given that any civil liberties group takes the time to oppose the legislation,
and given that our government can still be embarassed by stupidity.

Mr. Lindano:

Your challenge certainly sounds interesting.  I'd take you up on it
but I don't have a lot of time right now.  Maybe next semester before
the work gets too heavy.  I'm kind of interested in the 'embedded
keys' idea -- does that mean that the keys for each message are
somehow embedded in the message itself?  That sounds like a clever
idea.  I wonder how you hide the message key so the eavesdropper can't
find it -- maybe that key is useless to the eavesdropper otherwise.

Anyway, we can talk about that later, but right now could I ask a
question?

Suppose two people, A and B, are using your NuCrypt to encrypt their
messages.  Suppose an eavesdropper manages to get a copy of NuCrypt.
(Say he copies A's floppy.)  Can the eavesdropper now listen in to the
messages between A and B?

    Sorry about how that sounded, Dane.  I either have to start using a
LOT more smileys, or send all my correspondence in digitized voice, with
.GIF files included to show my facial expression!  In the interim, I'll
just try to be a bit more considerate about how I word my posts.

    You got me there.  It's my understanding that the Washington-Moscow
hotline once used just such a system for voice encryption, though that 
info may be outdated by now.  If it's good enough for that application, 
it would seem to me that it's probably good enough for about anything.
    However, I have no idea how their RNG works.  One might think it was
based on truly random events, like alpha decay or something, but I'd like
to think that the bright lads at COMSEC came up with a computational RNG 
designed just for that purpose.

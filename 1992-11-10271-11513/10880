I believe that the answer NeXT gave was that it didn't want to have
an international/domestic version, and to worry about some NeXTs not
understanding some e-mails while others can.  So, it was dropped
from this release.    Basically, they were waiting to hear from the
Gov't. if they would be allowed to export it, and they heard from
NSA/whomever that they could not (sometime between PR1 and PR2).

Does blessing = $$$ as it supposedly does now?  (I am under the
impression that you can use things like PGP if you get a license
from Public Key Partners)

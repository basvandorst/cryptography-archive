Many (most?) government contracts include the option of the contractor
retaining intellectual property rights.  The public rights to which
you refer are the fact that the government retains the non-exclusive
license to use the work it paid for -- a substantial public benefit.
A public right does not mean that any individual can benefit.

All of this is very normal and not at all new.  There are MANY
inventions out there making millions for companies that was paid
for in some way by the government.

The only "obvious" way around this is to use "steganography", where
through some (seemingly minor) changes in a cover message, you communicate
the "real" message.  Maybe through extra spaces here and there; maybe in
some sort of line break pattern; probably generically through some use
of "punctuation" in a message.

It makes data compression all the more important - if you can compress
the REAL message to 1/3 the size, there's only 1/3 as much "steganoizing"
to do, which is REALLY important, because this sort of scheme would
require a LOT of cover text.

And to avoid spoofing?  Might want to send an MD5 checksum via some other
channel...

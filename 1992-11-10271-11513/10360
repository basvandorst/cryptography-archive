	I'm sorry, but I don't see the difference.  I look on this the same
way I look on radar detectors -- there is nothing in common law, or any
law, that oblidges me to make the job of law enforcement easier by
essentially confessing to what I've done.  If I cannot be proven guilty,
too damn bad.  If noxon doesn't provide the encryption key, let the Congress
pay for the time and resources to find the key.  If they don't, it probably
wasn't worth prosecuting anyway.

	Should I provide the government with my password too, just so they
can more easily snoop around my files?  Screw 'em -- their job is law
enforcement, and my job is to get away with it.  I see no reason to make
their jobs easier at the expense of mine.

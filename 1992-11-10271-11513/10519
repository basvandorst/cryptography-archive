If I remember correctly a while ago there was an article about a
prove MD5 can (in theory) been broken but a double aplication
can be proven to be unbreakable.

I have two questions, first is who knows more about this subject,
second is whet exactly does double use mean. Does in mean
callinf the MD5TRANS function twice with the same block of
64 bytes?

I need this information for an archiver I am working on. I use the
MD5 for authenticy verification and for encryption.

On Nov 13 18:03, All heard the following from Jim Wenzel
(jim.wenzel@grapevine.lrk.ar.us ):

I cannot be sure if PGP is truly illegal. It really depends on how you interpet
the licensing information. I tried to send him mail and got no reply. Let him
know that skquinn@urchin.fidonet.org is trying to establish contact.

Encrypting to one's own public key works wonders. I do that over here myself.
No additional pass phrase to forget either. Of course, you can always create
your own key just for that purpose.

 JW> We can  all stick our  head in the  sand here and  say it won't  /

I will not do so, that is for sure. Whether or not everyone else chooses to is
another matter entirely.

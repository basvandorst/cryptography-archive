Dunno.

:
:2.) I am playing around with understanding RSA. Pretty simple.
:    (IMHO someone, someday, will find a fast way to factor huge primes)

I doubt it. A fast algorithm for factoring primes would be pretty useless.
(over Z that is).
 
What do you base your opinion on?


:    Anyway, the unencrypt step requires huge (x^y mod z) calculations.
:    Testing using 2-digit prime numbers still leads to computations such
:    as 1014^613 mod 1147 = 385. Can you point me to a fast numerical
:    algorithm for performing this type of computartion.
 
As always, see Knuth, Vol. 2. He has an entire section devoted to this.

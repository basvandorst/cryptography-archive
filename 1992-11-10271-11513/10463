I agree it is a very good document, and I envy it - the country I live
in doesn't have such a constitution.  I just wish you guys would _use_
it.  Your assertion about "the freest country" fails because you don't
- it would perhaps be true if the system would work according to the
constitution.  But it does no good to have such a document just
rotting away locked up somewhere, after even banning the material it's
printed on.

This isn't true.

You don't have to have an algorithm whose inversion is in NP to have it
be unbreakable.  All you need is a lower bound on the power of the
security parameter.

Ie., if the space-time required to break some algorithm is guaranteed
of order at least k^5, then you know how big to choose k so that a computer
using all the atoms of the universe would take billions of years to
do the inversion.

Of course, I'm told that that's a problem perhaps as hard as P=?NP.

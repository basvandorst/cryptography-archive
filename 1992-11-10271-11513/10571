Mr Qualtrough may not know that we also have a right against self-incrimination
in England and so there really is not that much difference between the two
countries in this respect.

However, our constitution is, as you imply, not written, and for this reason,
the final say on our laws belongs to the elected representatives of the
people rather than a group of unelected Supreme Court judges.  Our system
has served us well for 350 years, how is the US system "safer"?

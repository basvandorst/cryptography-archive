A smaller case to consier on this issue is that of stock markets and
publicly traded companies.   Right now the rules (backed up with laws)
require that all transactions be in the open, and that all information
used in deciding a transaction be in the open.

What is the effect of secure cryptography on insider trading?  With
routine cryptography, will it be possible to detect the transmission of
inside information?  Will stock traders have to live in bubbles, forbidden
to receive any encrypted messages?  Or instead would anybody wishing to
trade on the market be required to keep a database of all their keys, so
that in the event of a warrant, all their transactions could be cross-matched
and checked for inside information?

Are we fools for thinking that outsiders have a chance in the market today?

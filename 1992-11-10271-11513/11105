With all the talk about "suspected" child molesters, etc. I thought I
would bring up one point. How do people feel about restricting cryptographic
privileges of people once they have been convicted of a particular
set of crimes?

It seems to me that  once a person has violated certain rules, e.g.
child molestation, insider trading, etc.  one might restrict their
access to tools which are particularly useful towards those ends,
e.g. guns, crypto etc.

After all, in the case which is being discussed, hadn't this person
been previously convicted of child molesting?

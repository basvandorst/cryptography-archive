While this may have been true for penicillin, it's hard to make a similar
claim about the RSA crypto algorithms.  Good people have risked their very
livelihood to do the development and release it to the general public at
no cost.  Indeed, it would appear that the major stumbling block to the
widespread use of public key cryptography is the potential legal problems
associated with its use in the US.

	More to the point -- are citizens free from being beaten at gunpoint
by officers of the law acting outside the law?  The Rodney King case
is one example of officers acting outside the law (all white juries
not withstanding).  Another case was just recently when students at
UCSC were maced, kicked and beaten while holding a sit-in.  Some of
the students pleaded just to be left alone as the cops were beating them.
The cops thought this was the best way to get the students to disperse.
The cops involved said they would use violent tactics again if the students
refused to cooperate.  When I found this out, I was incredulous.  These
were law *enforcement* officers?  Whose laws are they enforcing?

	As for registering keys...why do law enforcement officials think
they have a right to know what I am saying to another person.  It seems
like this is an infringement on *freedom* of expression -- if my expression
to another person *must* be subject to monitoring, is it really free?

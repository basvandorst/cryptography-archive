In the US, seventeen years from the date of issuance of the patent.
In other countries, varying periods and some of them run from the
date of application rather than issuance.

I recall one of the first RSA papers being maybe in 1977 or 1978?
But a patent applied for then might not issue until a couple of years
later -- 1980 or later?  Such a patent would expire maybe in 1997?

If somebody will post the patent number I would be willing to check
and see when it expires.

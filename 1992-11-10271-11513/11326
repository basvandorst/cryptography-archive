I am wondering if there is likely to be written a PGP module to incorporate
it into the next version/patch level of Elm or another mailer?? Is this too
hot for mailer author(s) to handle? Or does MIME make such incorporations
unnecessary (I personally have yet to learn the ways of MIME) ?

Maybe I'll have to write it myself!

Does anyone know? please advise me via email at norstar@tnl.com -- thanks!!
I will summarize here if the answer is to some degree YES.

Yes, your post indeed is nonsense.  It's nonsense to call "nonsense" a
plain accurate description of why what the U.S. government does is
relevant to the rest of the world.

But I would add that the pressure by U.S. government is much more than
economical.  I wouldn't call invasion of Panama economical, as one
example.

If anything about this is "anti-American" in the sense of the ideals
the U.S. of A. was built on, it's the actions of U.S. government.

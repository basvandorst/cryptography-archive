	Of course he made the patent public.  A patent is a public
	record of an invention.  The claims describe an invention
	over which the inventor has the right to prevent anyone else
	practicing and therefore have to publicly described.
	The reason for the delay in the commercial development of
	penicillin was more likely the very mixed set of clinical
	trials.

Nice assertation.  Too bad it's false.

You may be willing to give that up, but I am not, and furthermore, you
have no right whatsoever to expect me to.  You may ask politiely, and
I'll decline politely.  If you ask more forcefully, I'll respond in
kind.  Personally, I'd much rather my neighbors be armed and risk them
being irresponsible (for which they'd be punished appropriately) than
to trust the government, or their agents to protect me.  Oddly enough,
my neighbors have a much better chance of protecting me than the
police do.  Of course, I live in a place where people look out for one
another, and where there are few restrictions on self-defense.  We
also have a fairly low crime rate.

My next question is, are you going to protect me when someone breaks
into my house at night?  When I'm accosted at an intersection, when
the government decides they don't like people under 5'8" and are going
to ship them off to the gas chambers?  No?  I thought so.

So, what you're saying is that it's not the fault of the cyanide, but
rather the one who uses it?  Does this mean you don't feel cyanide
should be banned?  Careful how you answer, a lot of modern chemistry
utilizes cyanide, it provides many many benefits to society.  Even
more odd,  I can legally posses the chemicals to make hydrogen cyanide
gas, in quantities big enough to wipe out a whole city, and it
wouldn't even be that expensive (relatively).  Personally the only
self defense usage I can see for cyanide is in "mantraps" which are
quite illegal.  My point is that it makes no sense to think that just
because I have the capability to murder (not kill, murder) that I
should be locked up for it, for you'd have to lock everyone up because
we *all* have the potential to murder.

One might note, it'll still be quite possible for law enforcement agencies to
spy on people... before or after the encrypted channel, when the message is in
human-readable format.  (eg, bugs in a phone handset, or a tap on a monitor 
cable, or even something as simple as making some modifications to a keyboard..)

Certainly, these aren't as easy as listening in on someone's cellular or
climbing a utility pole... but they do allow law enforcement officers to do
their job, while protecting the citizen's privacy.

Yes.  Attempts made to prevent their entry into the house *BEFORE*
the warrant was presented are certainly legal.  Or did you intend
to outlaw door locks?  Or doors?  Safes?  Walls with holes in them?
Yards with dirt that you can bury something in?  I think encryption 
falls into this category.  

Quickly encrypting the data when you hear the police demanding entry
may be illegal (obstruction of justice, or some such charge).  Nobody
does that anyway.  They destroy the evidence.

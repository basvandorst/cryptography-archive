Hello

I just stumbled across this net group and I thought a umber of you would  
be interested in our journal CRYPTOLOGIA.  The journal is refereed and is  
devoted to all aspects of cryptology, including computer science,  
mathematics, military science, cipher devices, history, challenging  
ciphers, and literature.  We are not "pushers" or marketers, indeed, Brian  
Winkel, one of five editors, teaches mathematics at Rose-Hulman Institute  
of Technology full time - very full time!.  But if you are interested send  
us (use US Mail, email, or FAX - see below) your US or overseas mail  
address so we can send you out our literature with complete information on  
the journal, Tables of Contents, back issue information, and subscription  
information.  The one-year subscription rate for CRYPTOLOGIA is $34.00  
(US) in the US and $40 (US) outside the US.  Thank you.

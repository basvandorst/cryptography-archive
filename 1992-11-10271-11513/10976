Not if they charge, say, $15 per key registered.

Seriously, arguments about flooding the key registration system with
10 keys, or 10^10 keys, fail to take into account the likely fees,
paperwork, filing requirements, etc.

And the real effect is, as I have written about it elsewhere, to limit
the use of crypto in general, not to cover all situations. A chilling
effect, indeed.

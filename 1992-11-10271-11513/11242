>> Mike Nemeth posts a canard that we are losing the war on drugs, as
>> support for his anti-enforcement position. That is simply untrue.
>> Quoting from "Devaluing of America--The Fight for Our Culture and Our
>> Children" by William J. Bennett, p.149:

Like I'd give any statistic that Bennett cited an ounce of credit.  He's
the one that took the citation on *any* level of pre-natal exposure to
*any* drug and claimed it was equivalent to the number of crack babies
born in the US.  Unless he gives specific references all these stats
I'd consider them worthless... 

lies, damn lies, and statistics...
 
>> "The number of current drug users FELL from 23 million to 12.9 million--a
>> drop of 44 percent--between 1985 and 1990.

Wonder where he pulled this stat from....  plus-minus 10 million is about
the general level of error for these kinds of stats  ("lets see, we pull
the *highest* estimate from 1985, and the *lowest* estimate from 1990, yeah
thats the ticket"). 

>> In 1985 there were 5.8 million current users of cocaine: five years later
>> that number was cut down to 1.6 million.

So, they're all using heroin or acid now....

>> From 1988 to 1990 there was a 26 percent decrease in the number of
>> cocaine-related emergency room visits.

According to NIDA stats this is bullshit.  There was a brief downward
decline in 1990 (I think that was the year) of a fraction of a percent
and then it resumed skyrocketing like it has through all of the 80's.
Bennett is smoking something harsh.

>> Marijuana use is at its lowest points since 1972.

Not surprising.  The population is aging QED there should be less
marijuana users.

>> Drug rehabilitation centers are half-full and many are closing.

This is total bullshit.  (unless they're half-full due to regs and closing
due to underfunding).

[...blah, blah, blah...]

>> We're winning, folks, despite the propaganda of people like Nemeth.

Look at the propaganda spewing from your own source first.

Try reading something like "The Case for Legalizing Drugs" which has
referenced stats.

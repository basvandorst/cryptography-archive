Ooohhh...  Somebody's lying!  Well, maybe we're both right and nobody's lying...

They won't license PGP users, but they would sell a license to Philip Zimmerman.
He doesn't want to pay their price for something he's giving away.  Would you?

What would happen if all the places that want to _buy_ PGP licenses (I assume 
that there are lots of companies that would pay a reasonable price for a 
license) would pool their money and give it to Zimmerman, so he could buy the 
license (and continue giving PGP away for free)?

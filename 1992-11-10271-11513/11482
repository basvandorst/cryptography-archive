"Common source" doesn't intrinsically result in making wiretapping
easier - discounting spoofing (which is, admittedly, difficult, but
hopefully not impossible to discount), giving away the public key
doesn't weaken the link.  This, of course, being the point to public
key encryption.

Eventually, SOME form of key registry is likely to be USEFUL.  PGP has
been developed with "Guerilla-style" key management in mind, but
things like signature repositories that would allow things like
anonymous banking WILL require some form of registration.  

'Twould be better to choose a way that is beneficial, rather than have
a government agency be the sole legislated repository, n'est pas?

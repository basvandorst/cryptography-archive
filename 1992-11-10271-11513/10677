If we used straight RSA, we could have the station on the moon always apply
the same transformation:

	y = x^d mod N

Each application would result both in removal of one envelope and in a fixed
time delay, t0.  If we wanted to have a real delay of t, we could compute

	k = ceil(t/t0)

	m = e^k

and encrypt our secret with

	y = x^m mod N

noting in the message packet the value of k.  Each round trip to the moon
would strip one envelope and would decrement the value of k -- so that when
k got to 0, the secret would pop out -- at the promised time.

However, there's still a flaw with this mechanism.  Someone wishing to
prevent disclosure of something embarrassing or criminal could blow up
the station on the moon or subvert the one on the earth into losing
or corrupting traffic.


So -- any better ideas for doing this?

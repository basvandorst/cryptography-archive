Smoking tobacco. Drinking alcohol. Telling kids they'll go to hell
if they do taboo thing X. I could go on for a while.

True. But what's recreational satisfaction compared to the blood
of innocents?

An aside: why is it that terms like "law-abiding" creep into
these descriptions? Are criminals unable to derive the same
recreational satisfaction?

Name just about any country in the EC. Remember, we're talking
about kids finding Daddy's gun and shooting each other with it out
of ignorance. That's *all* I'm talking about.

How much time do you have? :-) In short, for all the reasons Perot
outlined in his campaign speeches. (Not that I voted for Perot,
nosir.)

Ah, now we've gotten to crux of the problem, haven't we?

Programmers refer to an old, creaky, patched up system as "mature",
at least when they're trying to hire new blood. "Mature" is the way
I'd describe our system. Hell, it's just about the oldest government
on the planet.

A band-aid *does* address the problem. Just not very well.

I'm too cynical for that. Maybe when I have lots of money I'll
start thinking about solutions. For now, band-aids'll do fine.

 Possibly.  But does the fact that the government requires radio
 operators to keep logs, and may inspect those logs, also violate
 the Fifth Amendment?

 If the government were to regulate the use of cryptography and
 license users, keeping key logs could well be a condition for
 obtaining (and retaining) a license.

 That is one of the main issues for this group.  Government action
 may require re-thinking cryptosystem design.

 Does this constrain the argument that courts already have sufficient
 power to compel key disclosure?

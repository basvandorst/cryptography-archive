Are the following terms acceptable?


1.  I, Vaughan Pratt, agree that if P is not equal to NP then I will
pay you, Chris Long, $1000 on demand.  You agree that if P is equal to
NP then you will pay me $10,000 on demand.

2.  The question of whether P equals NP is widely considered to be open
today.  The parties will consider the status of this question changed
from "open" to "settled" when more than half, and no less than 20, of
the authorities openly stating an opinion agree that the question has
been settled, and also agree on the answer.

3.  The sole test for authority is membership on any past or present
ACM STOC or IEEE FOCS program committee, excluding the parties to this
agreement.

4.  This agreement shall lapse on December 31, 1995 / 2000 (delete one).

5.  Each party is entitled to have this agreement reviewed by an
attorney of their choice.

6.  This agreement is to be interpreted by and construed according to
the laws of the State of Nevada, and any action or other proceedings
pursuant to the agreement shall be brought in Reno, Nevada.

7.  Any such action, whether in equity, tort, or contract, shall be
submitted to binding arbitration according to the commercial
arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association.  The
prevailing party shall be entitled to an award of reasonable attorney's
fees and costs.

Would you prefer 1995 or 2000 as the year of expiration?

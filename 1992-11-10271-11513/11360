Well, I tend to argue the case for legal cryptography by using two arguments
which I think anyone can understand and sympathise with.

The first is:  Does the person arguing for a ban on cryptography trust the
government completely?  Is he happy to let the government eavesdrop on *his*
communications whenever *they* (not the populace) decide there's a good
reason?

If the answer is "Yes, I trust the government", then I give up.  You can't
argue with positions like that.

The second argument is:  Does the person arguing for a ban on cryptography
have any idea how this ban might be enforced?  Given that it is possible to
disguise encrypted data as plain text, how will the ban be enforced? 
House-to-house searches?  Polygraph tests?   Informants?  House Cryptographic
Activities hearings?

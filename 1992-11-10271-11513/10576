Wrongo, dude.  You and I are the militia, according to federal law.  That's
why the Director for Civilian Marksmanship is funded by Congress.  "NRA-
types" do NOT conceal the first part of the ammendment... it is crucial to
understanding the intent.

Now, perhaps you believe Parade magazine and other constitutional "scholars"
that the militia is really the Army.  I suggest you read the Constitution
again.  The language used is very important.  Whenever the army or navy or
other land forces are referenced, they are NEVER referred to as the "militia."
Please... actually READ the thing.

And it is NOT the interpretation of the courts that the 2nd ammendment
refers to the national guard or anything.  I suggest you find "The
Embarrasing Second Ammendment," which was published in the Yale Law
Review.  The author set out to prove just what you said, that the 2nd
did not, in fact, guarrantee individuals the right to bear arms.  But in
his research, he found just the opposite was true.  I don't have the
issue and date handy, but I'll find it for you if you're interested.

Tsk, tsk.  "Shoddy rhetoric."  "Tired piece of NRA propaganda."  Whenever
you don't have a case, just try to yell louder than the other guy, right?

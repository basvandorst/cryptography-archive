What is your area of expertise? ( None I presume) . Now whatever it is I
presume that this posting indicateds your willingness for free to give a
few days of your time to whoever askes you to donate it. I for example
have a yard that needs raking and cutting. You will be willing I presume
from this post to give me a few hours of your time to fly here ( you pay
of course) and do it for me. Most people have better things to do with
their time than to respond to juvenile challenges posed by each and
every person that wanders in. 
Of course if I have got you wrong and you had really been intending to
pay say $100/hr to have this done for you, I do appologise. If you had
only made that clear I am sure that you would have gotten a very
different response.
The internet is a wonderful place where you can often get increadibly
valuable information and advice and solutions to problems. To berate
people for not giving you free professional advice and work ( and
decrypting stuff even when it is straightforward is work) is childish,
inconsiderate and very rude.
(And no I am not a cryptographer- I couldnt decode a straight
transposition cipher even if I was told that's what it was.)

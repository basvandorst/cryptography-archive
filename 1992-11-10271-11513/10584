You betcha.  At Langley Research Center, all phone traffic is *subject*
to monitoring, ostensibly to ensure that work-related conversations are
taking place.  We use a ROLM phone CBX.  Apparently there has been abuse
of long-distance calling cabailities for personal conversations (even
personal business, such as pyramid insurance schemes and the like).  I
have absolutely no idea if I was ever listened in on, but at least NASA
can rightfully say that they own the equipment and put it there so I can
perform the duties they pay me for.  PLUS, we were told up front about
the possibility of monitoring.

This is much different than giving the impression of a secure line for
conducting attorney-client conversations and then recording it all (even
if they SAY they never listened to it).

"By contrast, the intrinsic bandwidth of one strand of dark fiber is some
25,000 GIGAhertz in each of three groups of frequencies - three passbands -
through which fiber can transmit light over long distances.  This bandwidth
might accommodate some 25,000 supercomputer 'stations' at a gigahertz per
terminal (or 2.5 billion AM radio stations)."

"You can send ALL messages everywhere in the network, include all needed
codes and instructions for correcting, decrypting and reading them, and
allow each terminal to tune into its own messages on its own wavelength,
just like a two-way radio."

Both of the above quotes are from a very interesting article by George
Gilder in the December 7, 1992, issue of Forbes ASAP, a technology
supplement to Forbes magazine.  The name of the article is "Into the
Fibersphere".  The basic concept is to use a fiberoptic network in a
similar manner to how the air is today used to broadcast radio/TV
signals.

Besides being interesting from a technical standpoint, I think this
concept may well have some implications as regards to the general
widespread use of cryptography.  I would be interested in hearing some
comments if any exist after reading this article.

P.S. I get dibs on the gal whose picture is on the front of the magazine!

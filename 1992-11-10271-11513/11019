Before the invention of electrical communication, people ensured their
privacy of conversation by looking for people within earshot.

Now, however, people have the illusion of privacy. [Imagine someone
whispering into a cellular phone.]

That privacy is returning to reality, gradually.

This means that law enforcement (LE) and crooks alike have had a brief
period (150 yers?) of easy access to what was intended to be private
conversations -- such that the tapper had little likelihood of being
discovered.

When this brief period finally comes to an end, LE will have to go back to
doing what it did before.

What was that -- or was it so long ago that people have forgotten?

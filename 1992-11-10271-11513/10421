really, there isn't much more to tell. a guy walked into the bank
put a bag on the counter, said he had a bomb & told the teller to 
hand over the money. the alarm went out, the man was arrested.

his defense? "I was joking". the bag contained a check he wanted to
cash. the judge let him off, despite the bank security's testimony
that he "appeared agitated".

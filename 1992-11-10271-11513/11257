    But there _have_ been calls for the continued legality of public-key
cryptosystems, since businesses recognize the key-management advantages
such systems provide over single-key ones like DES.  Most corporations
seem happy with the security DES affords, but would like to dispense
with single-key management problems.  It is trivially true that
corporations have no interest in supporting such crypto for the personal
communications of their employees, since they don't want to pay
employees for personal affairs, only for business ones; and it is
equally trivially true that they would not be concerned with using
crypto for internal data storage, since other systems already in place
(physical security, access control, tape lockups, etc.) have been paid
for and can be expected to do their jobs reasonably well.

    As I pointed out in my original post, the government would likely
support practically secure crypto for communications between its
contractors and itself.  (There's your `Type I' equipment.)  For
everybody else who wants it, NSA will be happy to ship you a board with
some proprietary blackbox chips on it for use in your PC, plus a 16-page
manual containing instructions and a mantra, "Trust us." (There's your
Type II.)  This is not `practically secure' crypto, since it violates
Kerckhoff's Assumption.  Corporations, who pay good money to hire good
security people who know about such things, did not `salute,' as you put
it.  On the basis of clumsy proposals like this I think it can be
reasonably concluded that NSA supports "data encryption" if you are
Martin Marietta communicating with Pentagon boffins about weapons
systems; otherwise, it supports "data encryption" which we can be
reasonably sure cannot be read by anybody but your intended recipient
and the NSA.
    _Of course_ NSA will not support freely available practically secure
crypto for the masses.  In its view, such a thing would only make its
own task, and that of domestic LE, harder.  But the burden of my
argument (and that of others in this thread) is that we must try to come
up with arguments, convincing to the public and legislators, why FAPSC
should be allowed anyway.

    I disagree (about business use).  A great deal of intelligence is (I
understand) gotten from intercepts of business communications.  Why
should intelligence agencies want to see that stream dry up?  (That's
the whole reason, as I see it, for the `Type II' Overtake equipment.)

    I still think that we have to try to construct _rhetorically_
convincing arguments which, for example, piggyback FAPSC for the general
public on the need for its use by business.  Politics makes strange
bedfellows, and if keeping FAPSC legal for the use of business allows us
to keep it legal for use by the masses, let's not kick our allies in 
business out of the sack.

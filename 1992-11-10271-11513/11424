Sci.crypt is the first place I have seen mention of the cyphers, IDEA, FEAL,
and FEE (or EE).  Can anybody tell me how they work?  Or, more likely,
references to their workings?

I saw the core code to IDEA posted, and will try to work it out, but
if there are any clear expositions, I would be thankful.

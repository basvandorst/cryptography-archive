This is an important point: Do you want to live in a society which has 
laws that people will obey because they are for the common good or do 
you want to live in a society where the government is able to force you 
to obey it's laws no matter how bad they are?

We in the U.S. suffer from too many secret police agencies now. You 
would be appalled to know what some of them are doing. Crime, organized 
or not, thrives in an environment where the ordinary citizens don't
trust the police.

Crypograpy is currently used both to keep your secrets from the 
government and your government secret from you. It shouldn't be that 
way. See .sig

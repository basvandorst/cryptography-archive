I'd say badly, Jimmy.  Dr. Carl Hammer, a great Beale enthusiast,
cautions against "force-fitting" solutions to Beale ciphers.  You are
on the edge of an abyss.

If you want an idea on how this can get out of hand, see if you
can scare up the book by William Friedman and his wife which showed
how the many people who tried to prove Francis Bacon was really
Shakespeare did so by "force-fitting" Shakespeare's works as
Baconian ciphers.  I've only seen the book in fragments, but even the
fragments show how easy it is to "self hoax" oneself if one allows
"solutions" of the type you give.

I don't have the exact title of the Friedmans' book, but it is 
something like "The Shakespearean Ciphers Examined" or "The Baconian
Shakespeare Ciphers Examined" or some such.  Can someone bail me out?

If the gov't were to gain the right to have our keys, don't give them the
public key.  Give them access to the DSU (digital signature unit) and let
them decrypt a session key -- in return for notification that they have
accessed it.  If notification to the suspect is ruled out, give it to
the NYTimes.


However, even this is DANGEROUS.

If you were to give people encrypted phones and let the government have a
back door, some people would shy away from using them or would use
additional encryption.  The gov't would have a chance to pass laws
outlawing additional encryption, now that all phones were encrypted.

But worse: if a person believes his conversation is private, he opens up
more -- reveals things.  I might even trust the gov't in general to be good
guys but there are always criminals within the gov't who aren't.

I would hate to be a party to seducing people into baring their souls
before government watchdogs -- especially with the danger that there'll be
another Bill Casey or Ollie North or Dick Nixon or ....

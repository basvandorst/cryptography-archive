Not only that - anyone who believes the government owes us a duty of
protection should go read the results of numerous lawsuits filed against
the police for failure to protect.  Universally, the courts (I think
including the U.S. Supreme Court) have ruled that the police do not have
any specific duty to protect you against harm, and have in all cases
ruled against the plaintiff.

Reginald Denny, as reported on 48 Hours this week, has filed a multi-
million-dollar lawsuit against the city of L.A. for the failure of the
police to protect him from the rioters.  I don't know why his attorney
is bothering - there is a huge body of precedent against a ruling in
his favor.

Compression should be used to flatten messages before encryption.  The
message probably should be scrambed in order after compression to remove
any regularity across messages which might assist attacks.

A good compression system should have a flat distribution of bits, statistically
completely un-predictable.  This is a consequence of Shannon's basic defs.

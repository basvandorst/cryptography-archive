One scheme to prevent spoofing is to enclose a message digest encrypted
with one's private key, which can be verified by the recipient by
using one's public key.

This provides a digest which reflects encryption with one's private key.
If a recipient can then produce a new digest, encryptied with the sender's
public key, he now has two streams of cipertext, one representing the
private key and one representing the public key, he has the plaintext,
and he has the public key.

Does this make it any easier to crack one's private key than if such
message digests weren't used at all (ignoring for the moment their
main purpose)? In particular, does it significantly weaken things?

I actually despise mordane posts, but I couldn't resist saying "Hello"
to all the law inforcement people reading this group, and to relieve the
bordom:
What did the banjo player get on his SAT test? drool...

More seriously, is it not better to include nonsense words every so often
and to deliberately spell foenetikallie to make it very difficult to
crack?  Who uses dictionary words for their password?  A deliberately
misspelled message encrypted would be much harder to break.

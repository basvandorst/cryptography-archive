I can imagine that LE agencies *on an investigation* would ask for the
secret key, or at least verifiable plaintext, and if refused *and* they had
evidence a charge of obstruction may be in order, but to criminalise the use
of encryption tools would be unenforceable, and would prevent protection of
correspondance from other non-government agencies, such as ex-spouses,
journalists, criminals etc.

It would simply be ignored by felons who intended to continue to break the
law, and would put felons trying to go straight at a disadvantage.

I therefore say that it would be a bad mistake to make this a crime in
itself. That is not to say that using these tools for criminal ends should be
without penalty.

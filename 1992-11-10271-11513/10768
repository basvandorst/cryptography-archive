	Dave,

	I'm not flaming you.  Unfortunately, I got back to this discussion
in mid-stream.

	I guess the idea of "to each his own" is lost on some people.
As long as the people that participate in these activities do not effect
you or society, what difference does it make whether or not they
participate in a that activity?

	I guess the idea of self reliance is lost on some people, too.  
I already have a parent.  I don't need another.

	First, I'd like to know if Mr. Gontier thinks the "blood of
innocents" includes crack dealers or gang members who are blown away
because they trespass on someone else's turf.

	More to the point, if people were oblidged to intercede on
behalf of the victim of a crime, instead of fearing legal retribution
and not getting involved, the "blood of innocents" may not have to be
spilled, but, again, the idea seems to be lost on some people.

(NOTE: I'm not condoning vigilantism, but I think far too many people
 "turn the other cheek" when they see a crime being committed.)

	You can call it "mature" if you want.  Most of the programmers
I know worth their weight typically call them "junk".  I've had to
work with some of these "mature" systems myself, and tend to agree with
their impressions.  Rewriting large sections of the system is typically
the only way to get them to function efficiently.

	Wait a minute, are we talking about computers or governments?

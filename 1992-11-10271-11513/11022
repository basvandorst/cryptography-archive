The key word in my text is "cooperation"; perhaps I should have said
"assistance".  If I write something down, and you get a warrant to
search and find it, it can be used against me.  I have seen no proposal
to change this.  However, I am not required to help you find what is
written down, nor to help you understand the meaning of what is written
down.  Really, I don't think we're disagreeing on this...

I must have misunderstood your position then.  I thought you were saying
that I could be compelled to reveal the (memorized) key to any encrypted
files which are found in a warranted search.  What exactly *is* your
position?

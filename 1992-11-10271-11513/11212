Not _Invented_ Here.  Precious few, if any, of the well-regarded
encryption schemes were developed on sci.crypt.  And those with
high regards gained these regards by withstanding the strongest
attack: given everything but the key, devise a way better than
exhaustive keyspace attack to decrypt a message.

Which is fine, as far as it goes, but most on sci.crypt are more
interested in the algolrithm than the puzzle output.  rec.games.misc
might have been a better place for this particular challange.

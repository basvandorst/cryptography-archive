Crypto was a very hot topic at this year's Hackers Conferene. The
Denning key registration trial balloon came up several times. Mike
Godwin of the EFF told me he expects something similar to the Denning
proposal to be used, even in a Clinton Administration. 

He's talking to folks around D.C. and the consensus is that the
various agencies are pressing for something along these lines.

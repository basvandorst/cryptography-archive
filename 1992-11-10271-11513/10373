A fantastically brilliant idea.  Dr. Denning's proposed set of
protections is so secure that that there's no way in hell the commies --
uh, sorry, the whoever-is-this-year-s -- could break into this National
Security information; therefore, we can now put the NS boys under the
same set of laws that the citizens are held to.

Where do I go to vote for this proposal?

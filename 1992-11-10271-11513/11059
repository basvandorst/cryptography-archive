Not everyone who is accused is guilty.  If the police couldn't
find sufficient evidence elsewhere -- the testimony of victims,
child pornography in the suspect's house, etc -- why would they
or you expect there to be evidence in his computer?  If you
robbed a bank, molested a child, or committed some other crime,
would you rush home, boot your computer and type in a detailed
description of what you had just done?!?!  Please, examine the
underlying assumptions which you are harboring.

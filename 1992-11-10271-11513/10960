       I suppose this would come under the "parental" theory of government 
like the drug laws.

       Free speech, unless somebody says something you don't

       Nice emotional appeal.

       The criminals we are discussing are not criminals based on how often
they go to the range to shoot at paper targets.  They're criminals based on 
illegal and dangerous uses of guns.  If you're using a gun to hurt somebody 
it doesn't matter how much fun you're having.
       On the other hand, if you're having fun and not hurting anybody, 
what's the problem?

      In most cases, the country's in the EC had low crime rates prior to 
their gun control laws.  The question isn't "Is there a country where there 
are gun bans and low gun crime rates," but "If we institute a gun ban will 
gun crime rates go down."  Except for some numbers that get argued here 
about Australia occasionally, this is generally not the case.
      Further, most countries with low gun crime rates often have low rates 
for other crimes that have nothing to do with guns, such as auto-theft, 
which you wouldn't expect to be impacted by gun laws.  Obviously there's 
more involved than just gun laws.

      To the best of my knowledge, these are classified under 
"accidental shootings," and those have been decreasing for decades, and rank 
behind most other forms of accidental injury and death.

       Oldest written Constitution, perhaps.  England's got us beat hand 
down in age.

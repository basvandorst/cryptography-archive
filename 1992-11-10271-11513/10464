The only difference is that people use cars to kill tens of thousands every
year.  Guns and cryptography are much less effective, so of course they must
be strictly controlled.

Wait... did I forget to raise my hand as a sarcasm alert?

Cars do, in fact, help maintain our freedom by giving us mobility other

to track, and hard to hide in your coat or on a floppy disk.

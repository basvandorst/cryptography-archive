If anyone has suggested the following, I apologise ... if (and I say IF)
one is going to register private keys in some way, then what of making
it a shared secret in accordance with some of the methods outlined by
people like David Chaum. 

Although it would make for a strange (and possibly unfortunate) overlap
between the courts and the LE agencies, one could share the secret
amongst a certain N authorities, where at least K <= N were needed to
reveal the secret, and at least one of the K had to be a court with
jurisdiction to issue an appropriate warrant.

I don't much like the idea myself, but I just raise the possibility.

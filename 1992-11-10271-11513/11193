Could you please supply more information? What problems? Furthermore,
in their FAQ they are claiming that they -are- allowing RSA
implementations for non-commercial use. Does this include PGP? If not,
why not?

Yeah, but:

1) RSAREF is not exportable from the USA. Since I am in Germany (on
the top of that, I am a Bulgarian citizen, so maybe the COCOM
restrictions also apply to me), this almost means that the package
does not exist.

2) RSAREF comes with those horrible flashy user interfaces that I hate
so much. Nothing like the elegant command-line driven approach in PGP.

3) RSAREF is a stand-alone program; it's kinda difficult to integrate
it with your e-mailer. (At least this is how I understood it; I might
be wrong.)

4) RSAREF runs only on a PC. In order to port it to some other
platforms you not only have to do all the job yourself, but must also
obtain RSADSI's permission for doing that.

5) RSAREF costs $50, PGP is FREE, and I have always supported the idea
of free software.

Vesselin

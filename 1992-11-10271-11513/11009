    Oh, I don't know about that.  The European public got rather a lot,
    and don't even have to pay royalties.  Come to that, PKP don't even
    have a monopoly.  A limited monopoly, limited to within the US, yes.

    "The public" != "The population of the US".

Excellent point.  I meant "the public" to mean the abstract public
who in the justification of patents temporarily give up their right
to use the invention freely, in exchange for getting to see the
details of the invention.  For RSA, this just means people in the US.

Michael T. Palmer argues that owning guns is a right guaranteed by the
Constitution which the State has no right to intervene in.

He is mistaken, and the argument itself is a tired piece of NRA propaganda.
A careful reading of the Constitution, as well as the interpretation of
many Constitutional scholars and the courts is that the relevant provision
is a Militia clause, not an individual gun clause. NRA types always
omit the Militia part of the language of the Constitution, and quote
the second part "the right to keep and bear arms" completely out of
context, often concealing their shoddy rhetoric by capitalizing the
leading "the" in the phrase to conceal that lead-in material has
been suppressed.

OK, hotshot.  I'm tired of the cheap shots and the ignorance.  
Let's see if you can take it anywhere near as good as you 
can dish it out.

Here is a simple cipher, suitable for 
aspiring cryptologists:

C4DACEE689
CDD8D192D9
D8DCD885DD
D7D8E6CACB
CAE4E185E6
CEC985D8E1
DC93E0C9D1
DC92DEE2DE
84DADED6CA
E5DCD8C6DE
D685D8D7C7
D7E9E2D9DC
D8D293C9E1
DA93DCCCD4
E5DEC993D1
C5DBD592D3
E289D8D7DF
E7C7DFCE84
CED692DEE2
DE84D5D5E4
D8DCDCD893

It is a cipher called "Vigenere" and H. F Gaines'
"Crytanalysis" will tell you everything you need to
know to break it.  It is a long enough sample
that you should have no trouble with it.  Note
please that I _have_ given you the algorithm.
If this cipher warranted, I would give you 
samples of the plain text, but anyone with any
experience with this cipher will agree that it is
not necessary; this system is too weak.  The Gaines
book is very widely availble; almost any public
library will have it and it covers this cipher
in detail.

This is a hexadecimal output of the result.  The
original text is ASCII English.  You'll need to
make some trivial, straightforward adjustments
to Gaines (which describes just the 26 letters),
but these adjustments are trivial and obvious.

  In particular: ct[i]= (pt[i] + key[q]) mod 256.

  where "i" is the current text position and "q"
  is the correct key position at i.  
  ct is cipher text and pt is plain text.

There are five bytes per line, here, but that 
is not necessarily significant; it 
is customary when giving Vigeneres in puzzle form
to show them in five letter groups and I 
have roughly followed that convention.

I, personally, will take your challenge a lot more
seriously when you show some minimal abilities.

Or, shall I put the shoe on the other foot and
begin taunting you, now?

When, you come back (if you come back), tell me
how many hours it took you to solve it.  One,
two, twenty?  Then, recall what I will tell you
now.  This is one of the most thoroughly broken
ciphers in the world.  In case you miss my drift,
the above has been given to you on a silver
platter.  You cannot fail if you try.  

And, if you reflect on this after you are done, 
you might find a flaw in your own system by yourself.

It might also give you some idea of what you are
asking us for, and the conditions under which you
are asking it.

Anyone is welcome to break this if they please, but
I would ask, in fairness to Erik, that no solutions
be published for at least two weeks.  He has
complained about we experts being some sort of
club with ex cathedra pronouncments and the like.

It's only fair to give him an opportunity to join
the club.

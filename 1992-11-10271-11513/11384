Does anyone know if the NSA is making any current recommendations to
U.S. businesses who wish to transmit economically sensitive
non-defense information to their agents in countries which: a) might
be considered economically hostile (or at least competitive); b) are
well endowed with communications intelligence equipment and
technology.

I have in mind specifically any current NSA recommendations to U.S.
companies making bids on Japanese projects where the U.S. company's
electronic mail might the the object of cryptographic interest to
either the Japanese government or to well-endowed Japanese
competitors.

Same question for bids in the former Soviet Union, Korea, France.

Does NSA feel DES is appropriate today under such circumstances? Is
there something else they recommend? One-time pads? Something more
convenient?

Anyone know?

Does anyone have an address to write to to ask, if the information
isn't known to someone here?

Replies by e-mail if anyone is uncomfortable giving details in
a public newsgroup read internationally.

Thanks;

If such an algorithm was found, I wouldn't trust RSA further than I
could throw it without a proof that factoring is something on this
order of hardness, and such a proof doesn't exist at the moment.  If
it's O(n^1000) today, then people will be bringing Fibonacci heaps and
hash tables and all sorts of odd things to bear on it until it's beaten
down to something smaller; and "something smaller" might be O(n^3).

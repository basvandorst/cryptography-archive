Well, come January 20 I think that that ``especially'' will change...

Be that as it may, we have our own examples very close to home (or to
$HOME).  A number of newsgroups feature ``anonymous contact services'',
with the attendant worries about the security of those services.  Indeed,
the code for one of them was just posted to a source newsgroup.

PGP can do a lot better -- the contact service just becomes a key
registry, and encrypted email can even be posted to some group like
alt.personals.gerbils.pgp.  Anonymous posting then becomes as simple
as an open NNTP port.

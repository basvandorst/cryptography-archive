   Some on this thread appear to believe that because they live outside
   the U.S. and are not U.S. citizens, that their actions need not comply
   with U.S. law. Permit me to remind you that the Supreme Court of the 
   U.S. has upheld the legality of U.S. agents arresting foreign nationals
   on foreign soil for crimes against U.S. law committed on foreign soil.
   Unless anyone expects their government to go to war against the U.S. 
   to protect them, you had better think twice about violating U.S. law,
   whoever you are and wherever you might be.

Okay then.  I intend to download a copy of PGP later, and use it for
something forbidden by the patent owners.  I fully expect the CIA to
knock on my door within a matter of hours.

On a more serious note, if it became necessary for the UK to go to war
to protect its right to self-determination then I would, very
reluctantly, have to support that.  I hope fervently that it doesn't
come to that again - but present events don't make me optimistic.
Countries trying to enforce extra-territorial laws in a small way is a
very bad omen; it is interesting to note that a lot of these laws are
expressly excepted from the normal provisions where the UK courts will
enforce foreign judgements in return for the foreign jurisdiction
doing the same.

you're ignoring the point. if the algorithm is going to run on a computer
it has to use "conventional ways". there are no hexadecimal Ouija 
board devices available for computer i know of. (if you've developed 
one, great, but you haven't claimed that yet, so this is a red 
herring.) any applications written to use this method still have to 
use the good ol' machine language.

anything that can be understood by a computer can be understood by a
human, given enough effort. -that- is the point. your algorithm
will eventually be known. 

jason, who doesn't care a bit about NuCrypt, but finds these claims
	rather absurd.

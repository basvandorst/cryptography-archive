I resent being called an anti-American distortionist the moment I have some
criticism on US policies.

The Bulgarians *had* a law to protect software. The US forced them to
incorporate it in the copyright law, instead of having a sui generis law.

The US is trying to export their view on UI copyright and software patents
through GATT talks and bilateral agreements.

That is just normal economic behaviour. And therefore, it is important for me
what the US does. It is because of the NSA's ideas on cryptography that
companies in the US aren't allowed to export systems that I can use legally
here.

Are we then talking about software theft? No. Mentioning software copyrights
in this issue is a distortion. Normal economic processes are at work that
make software companies try to create monopolies and use the US government to
get it done.

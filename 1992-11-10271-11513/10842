 I have done no such thing, nor have you quoted an example of
 me "refusing," nor even a clear statement of what you wanted
 me to do.

 It is not possible--nor even desirable--to compose a serious
 response to every posting on the topic.  Thus, it is necessary to
 respond to particular postings which illustrate problems or explore
 new issues.  Much of what you want has been posted, and it would
 only be necessary to read it, which would take probably 1/10th the
 time it takes me to write it out again.


 Since you have a belligerent writing style, express your points by
 metaphor, do this by innovating your own terms (such as:

>Subject: Demons and Ogres

 ), cannot stay with the title topic (thus rendering kill files on
 that topic useless), and bring my motives into question:

>>You have played a rhetorical trick in shifting the grounds
>>of the argument away from this fact, but you have not changed it.  If you
>>insist upon ignoring it while pushing your present line of argument, you will
>>put your motives into question.

 it is not clear to me why I should talk to you anyway.

 However . . .

 Well, first of all, I find it rather difficult to discover the
 real issue here, given all these invented and emotive terms
 and general fuzzy thinking.  You do consulting?

 Presumably, by the terms "demons" etc., you refer (again without
 quoting, so I can only presume) to my presentation of the child
 molesting issue which started off the original thread (of which
 this is not a part).  (Alas, this is not the only possible
 interpretation.)  As I have explained many times, my intent was
 to demonstrate that *at least some* real law enforcement concerns
 *do* exist with respect to the widespread use of real cryptography.
 Moreover, these concerns are completely separate and distinct from
 the discredited cold-war rhetoric of national security.

 My proposal, which is only a talking point, was intended to show
 how real law-enforcement concerns with cryptography *could* be
 addressed under law with much less than the strict control which
 the government previously enjoyed and may wish to soon regain.
 Real concerns can be addressed in a way which is less onerous than
 prior key registration, since *that* would give the executive
 branch the power to snoop on conversations.  But addressing real
 concerns *could* require that courts have the "right" to breach
 secrecy *after* due process.

 One thing I have not really addressed is this delusion that for
 some reason cryptography is "beyond government control."  Well,
 with respect to the development of cryptographic science, or other
 nations having strong cryptography, that is true.  It may be true
 for criminals.  But for ordinary citizens (that's us), it is
 definitely *not* true.  If the government regulates the public use
 of cryptography, you will comply or go to jail.  Simple as that.
 (Of course, nobody much cares what you do to your data in your home,
 or with your friends, unless there is a law-enforcement interest.)
 If you believe that there is no way any such law could be: a) passed,
 and  b) upheld in the courts, I have a bridge to sell you.

 I guess that some readers may exclaim, "But if crypto cannot be
 controlled for criminals, how could government justify controlling
 it for ordinary citizens?"  But the fact that criminals will *have*
 crypto (available) is hardly the same thing as saying that they can
 *use* crypto widely and publicly.  If use were illegal, any use in
 communications would draw attention to criminal activity.  Besides,
 does government really have to *justify* legislation?


 Now, as far as I can tell, what I am supposed to "answer" is how
 my proposal provides assistance to law-enforcement.  But here's
 the thing:  I've said it all here at least two or three times in
 the past couple of days.  If someone doesn't already know about
 this, they just aren't listening.  Of course, there was nothing
 there about "demons" or "monsters."


 Well, the problem is that cryptography can be used to hide the
 records which establish proof of crimes.  If bank fraud or
 embezzlement were hidden in this way, I doubt that anyone would
 be particularly sympathetic.  And as the society increases its
 dependence on data, the problem is going to get more dramatic.

 My approach would be to require that anyone using cryptography
 be prepared to provide future access to enciphered information
 to a court under due process.  Failure to do so would be a crime.

 The advantage which this would provide to law-enforcement is that
 criminals hiding evidence of their conduct could be convicted for
 "Failure to Disclose."  Indeed, such a conviction should be pretty
 quick and easy, and, since Justice always has a price, this may be
 a decent law enforcement alternative; much better, for example,
 than "Tax Evasion."  Since conviction on "Failure to Disclose"
 would also be easy to avoid (just reveal the key), it should not
 support much misuse.  Serious cases of accidental loss could be
 addressed by juries as usual, taking into account circumstances,
 background, etc.

 Clearly, I am suggesting that cryptography be considered *serious
 business*.  Those engaged in that business would be *responsible*
 for archiving keys against the day a court may need those keys.
 This, however, is not particularly different from the sort of
 record-keeping required in other serious businesses like banking.
 Consumer-oriented cryptosystems would also have to retain keys,
 and deactivation of this feature would again be "Failure to
 Disclose."

I'm not sure exactly what Chris meant by this comment.  If he meant,
"Anyone who believes it has been PROVEN that P=NP is an idiot",
his statement is probably justifiable (though excessively strong).

If he means that anyone who believes P MIGHT be equal to NP is "an
idiot", then I think Chris should retract his statement.

The problem is open.

Anyone who believes an open problem is beyond doubt is, to use
Chris's own terminology, an idiot.  The words "open problem" mean
the issue is debatable.  An argument that would convince experts
in the area that there is no doubt would be, by definition, a proof.

Of course, most theoreticians have strong opinions on this very
important topic, but this is hardly the same thing as saying that
P=NP beyond any doubt.

I personally would be as sceptical of proofs that P != NP as I
would be of proofs that P = NP.  Given the effort that has been
expended in the past, any new "proof" in the area is more likely
to contain fatal errors than to resolve the question.

   Dear B:
   I know you love to play with simulations of large cellular automata,
   particularly Conway's beautiful game of life.  Here is a file of
   initialization data for an NxN automation.  Enjoy.  Yours, A.

Life is a nice example - I was trying to think of uses like GIFs or music,
but it's pretty obvious when data sounds/looks like white noise.  
But life could work; fractals are another possibility,
especially if your fractal-generator feeds off random input.
"My fractal program produced this ugly random-looking output -- is it a bug?"

   .... illegally encrypted data, since A is presumed innocent.
   To do this they will have to decypher A's message.
   Perhaps they cannot, because they cannot break DES.  Even worse,
   perhaps they can break DES, but they do not want to reveal this in court.

It's relatively easy to get around the latter problem - they can claim
they were doing a brute-force or guessing search, and it guessed right.
Tough to do if your key is largely non-ASCII, but highly plausible for
short ASCII keys.  Or they can say they got an anonymous tip ....

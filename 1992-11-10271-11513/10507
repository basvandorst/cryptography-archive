	This is really cute.  You want more sweeping powers for the 
	government so it can protect us from the likes of Nixon and Ollie
	North.  Shoot, they WERE the government!!  Any time you give the
	feds more power they will use it to help the Nixons and Ollie Norths
	of this world to step on folks like me and you.  Go ahead, give up
	your freedom to our mommy the government.  I'll cast my lot with
	the Tom Paines and Ben Franklins of this world.

	You sound like you approve!  No one wants to go to jail but I hope
	that when push comes to shove our generation will contain some
	people like the people who wrote the U.S. constitution.  Freedom
	often requires sacrifice.  It was that way in Tom Paine's day and
	it will probably always be that way.

       Easy solution.  We provide severe penalties but don't enforce
       the law except in cases where a person is guilty of something
       terrible, but we cannot prove it.  It has worked in the past
       and continues to work today!

           Is a  :-(  in order?  Perhaps many  :-(  .

       And I do mean 'we' in the above paragraph.  'They' are still 'us',
       acting through our elected representatives.  Many good
       postings point out that 'we' are the problem; how do we convince
       ourselves to do the right thing?  'Ourselves' means us, our friends,
       and our neighbors.  One gentleman's idea of a White Paper which
       could be adopted collectivly and individually and presented to
       as many people as possible, by as many of us as possible, seems
       a wonderful first step.  It must address people's fears, even
       those fears that not all of us share.  I wish us luck.

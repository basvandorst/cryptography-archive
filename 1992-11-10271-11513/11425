Floating around on sci.crypt this past weekend, there seems to be another
round of the taunt: "what secrets could an individual have which could
warrant cryptography?"


Let's try some scenarios:

a husband and wife, separated by a business trip, talking intimately and
privately (they think) over a cellular or wireless phone (or even a normal
wired phone (eg., in a hotel))

two members of any of the thousands of *.Anonymous groups (a.k.a. 12-step
groups) in this country

someone who is HIV positive, employed by a company which would fire him/her
if they knew, talking to another HIV positive friend

two free-lance engineers, separated by a distance, cooperating on an
invention which will revolutionize <X>

[borrowed from earlier on sci.crypt] an incest surviver getting counselling
while going through the turmoil of the flood of memories when the initial
memory log-jam breaks

			------------------------------

It might be good to make an even more complete list.  However, I believe
that we need *only one*.  Each of these is innocent.  Each requires
privacy.  In none of these cases is it the business of any government
agency what is being discussed.  Therefore, they have no right to listen
in.  It is especially not good for any criminal organization to tap these
conversations (phone, e-mail, FAX, videoconference, ...).

As I said, all it takes is one.  I've listed 5.

Let's hear no more of this "what could innocent people have to hide?" 
nonsense.

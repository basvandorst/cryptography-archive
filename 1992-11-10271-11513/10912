Yup, it's output feedback mode.  You generate the pseudo-random key
as follows:

	C[0] = DES(K, IV)
	C[n+1] = DES(K, C[n])

where K is the 56-bit DES key and IV is a 64-bit initial vector.

The different modes of DES have different properties.  I suggest
reading Davies and Price's ``Security for Computer Networks'' for
an excellent discussion of the topic.

       Oh, I don't know about that.  The European public got rather a lot,

       "The public" != "The population of the US".

   Good point.  I meant "the public" to mean the abstract public who in
   the justification of patents temporarily give up their right to use
   the invention freely, in exchange for getting to see the details of
   the invention.  For RSA, this just means people in the US.

   Note, however, that even the European public didn't get anything in
   exchange for the US RSA patent.  RSA was already published (through
   great effort of R+S+A, against opposition from the US spy agencies)
   before the US patent was applied for.  Without the US patent,
   Europeans would still be able to use RSA, *plus* any number of
   RSA-using programs and devices that might have been developed in the
   US but were prevented by the patent.  Thus, even for Europeans, the US
   patent is a cost with no benefit.

It is difficult to quantify that cost to me, but I accept that it is
probably positive.  I could make a case that it actually benefitted me
*as a European* because it left me an open market to expand into
without the hassle of US competition.  Because I *as an individual*
didn't do so, is my fault for not being entrepreneurially-minded
enough.

   I detect in your article a (justifiable) tone of gloating that
   European patent law is presently less stupid than US patent law.  You

I plead guilty, m'Lud.  However, I can provide examples of idiocies in
UK law with which you are not encumbered.  Consider our Offical
Secrets Act, for instance.

   might want to take note that the pending international GATT treaty
   will impose the stupidity of software patents on all signatories.  If
   the US Government gets your country to sign the treaty, then this
   idiocy will control your actions as it now does ours :-(.  You might

I am well aware of this sad fact.  I (only slightly) hoped the French
would be able to bring down the GATT talks.  Only slightly, as I'm
pretty sure that that cure would be worse than the disease.  Trade
wars are vastly more damaging than software patents (IMHO).

   want to do something about this situation by opposing the treaty in
   your country.  For more information, write league@uunet.uu.net as
   usual.


Unfortunately, I believe it's too late.  A Ghandi-like campaign of
massive peaceful civil disobedience might be the only method to work.
Such campaigns inevitably require martyrs.  They don't have
particularly good success rates either -- witness the motorcycle
crash-helmet campaigns in the UK.

Sorry, this is getting rather a long way from cryptology.

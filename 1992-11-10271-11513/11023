Does anyone have details of this week's illegal wiretap (by the FBI
against the Dept. of State official who had Clinton's and Perot's files
searched)?

Does anyone know how the FBI happened to tap this person?  Unless there's
a time machine out there, how would it have known to tap? ...or does it
just tap everybody and decide later to admit it, if something interesting
was said?

While I admit it is more technically challenging to tap
into the middle of a V.32/V.32bis session than, say, a
V.22 session, I too think that it is reasonably easy for
those with the proper equipment.  Furthermore, if the
tap happens at the _start_ of a session, (and an
intrusive tap is practical,) you could just spoof the
conversation with a pair of V.32 modems -- one talking
to the sender, one to the receiver, and a data tee on
the line connecting the modems.

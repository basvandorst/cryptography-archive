 I tend to agree. I told him so myself. However, neither your comment 
 nor mine seem to deter him.  He insists that neither you nor I can 
 break his encryption. I know *I* can't. How about you?? Do you feel
 you could crack such a thing?
 
 (In the back of my mind, a thought on this is: in the final analysis, 
 is the purpose of encryption to encrypt securely, or to conform to 
 some particular rule or method..? )

 Yeah, I told him that. For all I know, he may have actually done so, 
 but the challenge stands.  Do you think YOU could break his 
 encryption? If not, perhaps you have no right to send him 
 anywhere...  I know I can't, but then I am no expert. The challenge I 
 posted was addressed to the experts here, but no one seems to have 
 accepted, and that saddens me. I had hoped to have at least several 
 expert cryptanalysts here accept the challenge and show him how 
 wrong he is.  But no one has accepted so far...

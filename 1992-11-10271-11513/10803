According to the AP, it wasn't the FBI at all, it was done by a unit
of the State Department.  I quote:

	   The operations center has routinely monitored phone
	   conversations between department officials, foreign
	   diplomats and others for years as a matter of standard
	   operating procedure. Such monitoring has been described as a
	   convenience for officials who may later want a record of the
	   conversation.

The FBI is investigating to see if Federal laws was violated, since the
law requires that at least one party to the calls be aware of the
monitoring.

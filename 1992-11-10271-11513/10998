Why must things be taken to extremes?  Technology that is primarily used to
bring harm to people or avoid law enforcement agencies should be limited in
their distribution and monitored closely.  We don't want offensive nuclear
capability to spread to unstable nations or handguns to be given to people
with a history of violent crime(s) or mental instability.  On the other hand
we want to keep the right to bear arms and use them in self defense and promote
the use of nuclear technology when it comes to non-destructive purposes. The
same holds with cryptography-- limit it so that the abuse by criminals and
other hostile bodies will have the capability to misuse it.  Allow only those
encryption methods defeatable by the law enforcement agencies to distributed
and outlaw the distribution of more powerful methods.  And enforce laws that
will help protect the common man's privacy from those who have no business in
decrypting his data.

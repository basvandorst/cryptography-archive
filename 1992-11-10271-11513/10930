I suggest that the first ammendment will stand up no better than the fourth
and fifth.  The gov't will simply invoke civil forfeiture against those who
use cryptographic methods to conceal what it wants to see.  There is nothing
illegal about having a lot of cash on your person,  but that hasn't stopped
various LE agencies from seizing same.  Just so,  using encryption could be
seen as justification for forfeiture.

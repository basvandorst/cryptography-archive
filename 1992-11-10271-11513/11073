	Name some.

	bans on handguns.

	Is Gontier going to name these Nirvanas anytime soon?

	Gontier is willing to make criminals out of 50% of the
	population of the US to try to prevent less than
	1,400 fatalities per year.

	One wonders how Gontier would solve other problems;
	automobile fatalities, for example.

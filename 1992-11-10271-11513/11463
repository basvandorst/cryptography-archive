The cash economy is alive and well in Las Vegas.  It amazes me the volume of
business there that is transaction with cash, and that transactions in the
thousands of dollars are not just sometimes done with cash, they are
routinely done with cash.

There was a time when Las Vegas was run by the mob, which was bad, but it
had the pleasant side effect of eliminating most other crime -- the mob
claimed a monopoly on that, and anybody who tried in on their territory
ended up as bleached bones in a part of the desert nobody ever went.

Today the casinos are owned by big corporations, but those days linger on.

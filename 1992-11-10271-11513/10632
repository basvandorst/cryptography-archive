Having a system of this sort would probably be acceptable to people,
with the IMPORTANT caveat that people ARE permitted to add their own
encryption.

That "of course" that you put in there (+) is a VERY important one;
those that want private communications legislated out of private hands
rephrase it "of course NOT."

There are a couple of little problems with the system:

- While it may eliminate problems of industrial espionage and the
likes, it doesn't eliminate governmental espionage.  This is pretty
much a given, and IF extra encryption may be added, the "problem"
probably CAN get eliminated.

- People may trust it too much.  It DOES have a big weakness in that
government CAN break it.

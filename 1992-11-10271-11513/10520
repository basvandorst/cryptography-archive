It was suggested that a human listener would be required to determine when
the scrambled speech was "cleared" because recognision technology is not
up to it.  This is just plain false.  The spectral characteristics of clear
versus scrambled speech are easily distinguished.  Scrambled speech is useful
when the opponent does not have much time available to unscramble -- as is
the case in battlefield communications.  The value of the information declines
so fast that unscrambling is often not worth the trouble.

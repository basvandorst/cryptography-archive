If I am using a cryptosystem (for example RSA) commencing 
with a Public Key but with provision for new Keys to be created 
automatically and brought into use between the terminals at 
random intervals without human intervention and with 
arrangements to transmit a continuous stream of random bytes 
until a "real message" was inserted into the stream at a random 
moment after which the transmission of random bytes continued 
so that the Keys actually in use when the "real message" was 
transmitted were held fleetingly within the hardware and were 
unknown to any human and with the further arrangement that any 
attempt to interfere mechanically or electrically with the 
hardware would result in all keys being erased -----  PLEASE 
EXPLAIN WHICH KEY I AM SUPPOSED TO REGISTER WITH THE DEPARTMENT 
DESIGNATED FOR THAT PURPOSE.

Or do you suggest that I am forbidden to use a cryptosystem of 
that character but must employ simpler methods which of course 
will be less of a protection for the information I wish to transmit.

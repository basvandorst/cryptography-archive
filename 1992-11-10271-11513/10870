Even if it were possible to make all 200 million or so guns in private
hands disappear and prevent new ones from being made or imported
(compare to success of US War on Drugs), is this what we want? Is a
woman free from rape simply because criminals now have only knives,
clubs and their two strong arms to use? Or are people like Unruh simply
insensitive to the situation of women and the elderly as long as *he*
can have a "fair" fight with the criminals? Has Unruh ever considered
that criminals can work together so that it might be two of them
against one of him?

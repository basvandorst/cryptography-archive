The point which should be made (in the FAQ at least, and probably here) is
that the fact that no one reading this group wants to take this time does
not imply that the method is secure.  This attempt goes under the name
"security by obscurity" and protects only against lazy attackers.  A system
which is secure only against lazy attackers isn't worth anything.

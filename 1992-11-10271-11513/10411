	Thanks again Carl.

	Looking into the FAQ on RSA by Paul Fahn of RSA Labs at question 2.22
'Is RSA patented' we see the patent numbers and the following:

"In North America, a license is needed to "make,use or sell" RSA. However,
PKP has a policy that anyone may use RSA non-commercially for personal,
academic or intellectual reason without a license;"

The FAQ goes on to define some examples. The personal use of RSA I have in mind
is to encrypt my incomming plaintext mail. I think that E-mail should have the
same protections as postal mail and RSA is the 'key' to keeping snoops out.

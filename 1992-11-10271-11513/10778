	The point is that existing laws do not keep the dangerous off the
street for any length of time and therefore your argument for the registration
of PKC keys is moot. You are lost because you are thinking in a detached from
the problem mode. Some kind of an intelectual game not the deeply insightfull
modde of thought that is required for this issue. (see my next followup for
more details)

	No, it does not mean that. It means to look at the real arguments. It
means that you would have a differient viewpoint if you were looking at this as
a father instead of as an intellectual game.

sci.crypt has a posting indicating an rsa.tar.Z is available. If one
looks closely there is also available an "export" version of RIPEM,
called RPEM, is provided by the author/maintainer of RIPEM.

Presumably the RSA and DES (the RSAREF library contents) code have
been "stripped" from the RPEM submission. Noteworthy, however, is that
versions of RSA and DES software are available on the same ftp site in
the same directory.

This would seem to make RIPEM available internationally. The remaining
question is whether the an implementation of RPEM that interoperates
successfully with RIPEM has been done using the code provided at that
ftp site.

This also implies that all the code necessary to make an encryption
compatible PGP is available!

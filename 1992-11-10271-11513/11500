Can you say ``paranoid fantasy''?

Look, some degree of paranoia is healthy, but this is going too far.
(a) patent infringement is *not* a criminal offense;  (b) the Court did
not rule that kidnapping was unconditionally legal; rather, it said
that in the absence of a rule against it -- such as in the extradition
treaty with the host country -- it was permissible;  (c) the U.S. is
signatory is any number of international patent treaties that define
the scope of U.S. patents, and thus implicitly rule out extension of
U.S. jurisdiction to foreign countries.  That is, there's a rule
against it.  In the Noriega and Camarena cases, there was at least the
(bad) excuse that the drug smuggling is an international offense that
the host nations couldn't or wouldn't prosecute.  Infringement of
another country's patents certainly does not fall into that category;
the treaties regulating patents -- unlike some of the copyright
conventions -- are cognizant of differing national practices.

Please -- there's a lot wrong that we can fix.  Let's concentrate on
the real issues.  This isn't one of them.

I have been suing the NSA under the Freedom of Information Act to get
copies of textbooks on cryptanalysis written by William Friedman in
the 1930's and by Lambros Callimahos in the 1950's.  After filing
the FOIA suit, we found that copies of two of the documents exist
in public libraries.  NSA claims they are still classified.  The SF Examiner
of today, Wed 25 November, covers the case in a front-page story.

More details will be forthcoming; we've been waiting til we had time to
scan in all the filings in the case, to present the complete record.
But I wanted people to know about the news coverage while the newspaper
is still available.

	John

PS:  There's a rumor today that NSA has decided to declassify some or all
of the documents.  I have no official word, but my lawyer who's handling
the case is on vacation for a few days.

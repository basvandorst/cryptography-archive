RPEM is a program which uses Rabin encryption in conjunction with 
DES/NEWDES. It was released about a year ago. It does have some code 
in common with RIPEM, but it is certainly not an export version of 
RIPEM. There is a longer story about RPEM involving some nasty 
business with PKP, which I won't go into now.

Well, I suppose you could use the code available at ghost as a 
starting point for writing a program which would interoperate with 
RIPEM, but that would take considerable time and effort.

Rahul Dhesi treads dangerously close to anti-democratic heresy when he
speaks of the owners making the rules, and "State-owned roads." The
roads aren't owned by the State except in non-democratic countries.
The roads are owned by the people and administered by the State.

In the U.S., at least, we make a distinction between State-owned, and
"public". Thus the roads are public and anyone may use them (subject
to the maintenance of public order), while the Oval Office in the
White House is State-owned and only the President and his designees
may use it. The National Parks are public and anyone may use them
(subject to due-process rules of order) while the garden of the 
Vice-President's house at the Naval Observatory grounds is state-
owned and only he and his designees may use them.

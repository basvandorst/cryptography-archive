Wrong reason.

Title 18 says it must be with the consent of one of the parties participating
in the conversation (varies state by state, but never less than one party).

If you are using a phone in a hotel, the hotel owner can't tap the phone
in your room, even though the phone is their property.

If you are in a middle of a divorce, you can't tap to your spouse's phone
calls even if you are paying the phone bills (this is the most common 
violation of the wiretap law that gets caught).

Employer monitoring of calls is usually justified that consent was obtained
as one of the conditions of employment (or that the customer somehow consented).

However, Title 18 allows the executive branch of government to conduct
"COMSEC" (communications security) on equipment owned by the executive
branch (or government contractors). So you are correct that ALL calls
made on executive branch phones are subject to monitoring, but not
because they are the party that pays the bills.  Rather because the law
specifically exempts executive branch telecommunications equipement
from the law.

The FBI can't tap either the legislative, or judical branches phones without
a court order (or meeting some other statutory requirement) even though the
government is also paying for their phones.  I'm not sure where the
"independent" parts of government fit.

Those additional characters are going to be a *real* pain. To "flatten"
the distribution of a "reasonably sized" message is going to require 
(at a guess) 3 to 10 times as much "additional" text as plaintext.
This violates the first rule of a good crypto system - that it not
greatly increase the size of the message!

No. "Reasonably sized" is a recognition of the fact that cracking a 
text becomes harder the shorter it is. Try cracking a 5 *character*
message sometime!

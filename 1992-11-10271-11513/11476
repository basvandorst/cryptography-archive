Yes, this is me following up to my own post.  I wanted to thank those
who held me back from the "abyss".  But I most point out that you folks
are no fun at all.  The next time I have something interesting to post
I think I will put it on alt.conspiracy - you can always get someone
to jump on the bandwagon there :-).

Just in case I was on the right track with this Beale cipher thing, 
remember you heard it here first - otherwise I will deny everything. The
idea can't be all bad -- when I talked to Elvis in the Kmart about it
the other day he backed me up 100% :-) :-).

Later,
Jimmy

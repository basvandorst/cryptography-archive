Why does it have to be in a hotel?  Does anyone really think it would be at
all difficult to tap the phone lines leaving your home or office?

Also, the proponents of key registration will bring up the "child molester
/ drug dealer demon" (thoroughly discussed already....)  Well, this
scenario (above) provides us with a demon of our own:

"Do you really want the gov't in your private & intimate lives - why not
let them put cameras in the bedrooms next!"

I know - it isn't really relevant to the issue, but it IS an emotional
issue that may be effective on people that don't think logically - the same
people the "molester/dealer" thing would work on...

This is good, but let's examine some scenarios targetted at groups of
(hopefully) influential people.  All of these cases are valid for any type
of electronic communication.

Businessmen: A branch office talking to the main office about some new
marketting strategy, or sales figures for that quarter, or great new
product idea, etc.

Lawyers: A lawyer talking to his/her client about a trial.

Doctors: A physician talking to his/her patient about (pick any) private
medical problem.

Politician: Campaign organizers talking about new adds to run and new
groups of voters to target.

General: Basically, any competitive situation where you don't want the
opposition to know what you are up to - esp. if there is a lot of $money$,
personal risk, or _power_ involved!


Another point that I haven't seen raised.  Let's assume, for the sake of
argument, that the gov't is truly benevolent.  The people in power (insert
various 3 letter acronyms) aren't going to abuse the key registration
depository.  Now, try the following on for size:

1) There are going to be a LOT of keys to register, which means a lot of
people involved.

2) Not all of these people are going to be happy with the huge salary we
just know the gov't will pay them for such important work.  Or maybe they
hate their boss.  Or maybe they are just unhappy with life, the unvierse,
and evverything.  Let's call one of these people Mr. Disgruntled.

3) Mr. Nasty wants some information on Mr. Honest's current business,
political, and/or personal activities - it seems some deal worth $$$$$$$$
is about to go down.

4) Mr. Nasty finds Mr. Disgruntled, and offers him $$$$$ (still more than
Mr. D. ever expected to see in his lifetime) to give Mr. N. all the keys
that Mr. H. used in the past year.  Now there's just a chance that Mr. D.
will accept.  (For those that need a reality check and don't believe the
chances of this are very high, just look at the way the xUSSR acquired a
lot of Top Secret National Security stuff from bored/disgruntled Americans
- they mainly offered money and a "chance for some adventure".  Also, I
think that somebody wouldn't feel nearly as bad compromising another
person's security as opposed to the whole country's!)

5) Mr. Honest had registered all of his keys (in accordance with the law).
He also trusted the gov't to keep the keys secret - why else up encryption?
- so he used open communication channels - which Mr. Nasty has been
recording.

6) Now, Mr. Nasty can decrypt everything Mr. Honest has said in the last
year, and blow Mr. Honest's chances of "winning" in the future out of the
water (Again, for the reality impaired - confidential information is
essential to ANY large scale competitive transaction.  For example, try
beating somebody out on a contract bid when they know YOUR bid ahead of
time!)

Note that there was no abuse of power by the gov't in the above example!

I personally believe that such situations are going to be the most common
problems if a key registry is created.  Maybe there is a solution to the
problem of restraining the XXX agencies (but probably not), or maybe they
really do just have our best interests in mind _100%_ of the time :-\, but
I just don't see how you could realistically expect to insure the security
of every person with access to the key depository.  _Any_ breaches (read
disgruntled people w/ access) could open the floodgates for the above sort
of incident (or blackmail, or corporate espionage, etc.)

ps. Somebody mentioned creation of a group sci.crypt.politics.  Any
progress on that?

 The collected body of people who function under The Constitution.

 From the agreements chartered by The Constitution.
 (At least!  Perhaps also common law and unwritten moral law).

 "Agents of the government" do arrest people *under the authority*
 granted by *social institutions*.

 Well, I'm not really going to get into the semantics of the
 difference between "society" and "the government".  Does "the
 government" enforce law for itself, or does it in some sense
 "stand for" society at large and draw its authority from that
 body?

 The Constitution certainly *does* recognize things which
 we would call "rights" if the government were an individual.
 If semantically these things are not "rights," feel free to
 change my use of the term to whatever you think it should be.
 Changing the term does not change the point:

 Prior to the advent of personal computers and strong cryptography,
 anything beyond what one could remember was, in the end, open to
 examination by society.  As far as I know, this was a traditional
 and accepted basis for much or most of Western society.  Personal
 computers and cryptography have changed the ability of (the agents
 of) society to perform that function, which might challenge the
 relationship between law enforcement and society at large.

 Well, there seems to be a lot of "fuzzy thinking" going around.

 Consider the wording of The Fourth Amendment:

      The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses,
      papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and
      seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue,
      but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation,
      and particularly describing the place to be searched, and
      the persons or things to be searched.

 Clearly this protects a "right of the people."  But it *also*
 implicitly recognizes (in my terms) a "right" of government to
 search and seize, provided only that a specific warrant issues
 based on probable cause.

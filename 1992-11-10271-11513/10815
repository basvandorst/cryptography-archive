I'll have to disagree there. "Lazy attacker" is a fuzzy term. Is my front
door with its deadbolt lock only secure against lazy attackers? - determined
burglars could simply break down the door with an axe. If a cryptosystem
requires more effort to decode a given message than the economic worth of
the message, then that system is okay for its target use. Maybe the system
of the original poster's "friend" is only good for protecting junior high
school love letters; still one can't declare it worthless.

Sorry for wasting the group's time arguing semantics.

 The name seems familiar... the PKZIP password cracker? 
 How... ah, interesting that you should make so many assumptions 
 regarding an encryption method that you haven't even seen.  
 
 Well, if it's that simple, it should be real easy to crack! Wanna 
 try?  (Actually, NuCrypt uses embedded, 2048-bit continuously- 
 shifting keys.  Not sure what that means, but you might know :-)   
 Feel like taking a pot shot at it?  Nah, you're probably too busy 
 doing something else this time of year, right?  Mating season 
 perhaps..?

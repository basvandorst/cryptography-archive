It would pretty much require that ALL encryption be treated pretty
much in the same way as munitions.

What if the "criminal" decides to start a business?  Not all
"businesses" are enormous corporations - there's a lot of essentially
personal corporations out there.  It ain't anywhere CLOSE to enough to
say that "Business" can use crypt, and "People" can't.  That sort of
definition does not a law make.

Only if cryptography is to be treated identically to munitions.  There
certainly are some similarities, but there are also a lot of differences.

What if banks start to offer "in-home banking services," that require
some form of encryption technology?  Does it suddenly become illegal
to make use of such services?

Is the fact that data encryption is currently used for ATM banking
services a problem?

What if we wind up having "SecurePhones", that cost $79.95, and let
you communicate privately using crypt?  What if they became
sufficiently ubiquitous that ``everyone has one.''  Are we going to
keep criminals from using the communications system?

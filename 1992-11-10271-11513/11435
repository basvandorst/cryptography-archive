I know nothing about the patent law implications, but the European
subsidiary of a US company must adhere to US regulations regarding
export of cryptographic equipment.  If the European daughter sells
a product that would require an export license, the US Government
can hold the US mother company responsible.

That's what I've been told.  I'm not a lawyer.

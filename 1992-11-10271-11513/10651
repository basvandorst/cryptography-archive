Not necessarily.  If Congress were willing to give Nixon immunity
against *criminal* prosecution for what this information would reveal,
then he could not take the Fifth.  And Congress could even have used
it to impeach and remove him from office, as indeed his "smoking gun"
tapes effectively did. As satisfying as it might have been to toss
Nixon in jail, you have to admit that just getting him out of office
was much more important to the country.

This comes with the territory. Either everyone has the right to encrypt,
including slimy politicians, or no one will.

What about all of the face-to-face conversations Ollie had that were
never recorded anywhere? Isn't that a loophole? Perhaps we should
require everyone to carry personal bugs 24 hours/day.

Again, is it so important to actually prosecute these people? Or is it
more important to get the facts out in front of the people so the
politicians responsible could be held accountable at the next election
(or sooner, if it was warranted)? If the latter, then the Fifth need
not be an obstacle -- just grant immunity.

Remember that many of these scandals are really institutional problems
with institutional solutions. It may be more emotionally satisfying to
nail a few culprits to the wall, but fixing the system instead has a
better chance of keeping it from happening again.

A misstatement. It is not true that "no one (would be) under any
obligation".  If you can identify one of the members of the conspiracy
and compel him/her to reveal the key in exchange for immunity, you can
use it against the others.

Exactly. And this is why cryptography is of such limited usefulness in
actually protecting a criminal conspiracy, and why its "threat" to
legitimate law enforcement is so greatly overstated.

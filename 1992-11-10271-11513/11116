If I wanted to do this with an RSA system, I'd put my session key in
a record with an expiration datime.  My tamper-resistent Digital Signing
Unit would check the expiration datime and refuse to give me a session
key which has expired.  Under no circumstances would anyone be allowed
to get the secret part of the RSA key out of the DSU.  There would be
no passive backup of the DSU.

(This calls for a fault tolerant DSU, but then all computers are FT,
aren't they?  :-)

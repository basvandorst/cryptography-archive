        This raises an interesting question: Given an unpredictable
        number generator (never mind how), just how (statistically)
        random does its output have to be to be cryptographically
        strong? I'm thinking of something like Pickover's strange
        attractor. There's a hazy pattern there, but it doesn't seem
        that the pattern would be a useful analytic tool.

        For the record, Pickover's Strange Attractor:

        X' = sin(a*Y) - Z*cos(b*X)
        Y' = Z*sin(c*X) - cos(d*Y)
        Z' = e*sin(X)

                a,b,c,d,e and the initial X,Y,Z are arbitrary values.

        I'm not suggesting that Pickover is an UNG, but offering it as
        an example of a generator with a non-random, but interesting
        distribution.

        Cheers,
                Marc

The best way to deal with that "frailty" so far is: DON'T tempt
a person with power, if it can be avoided. Every record clearly
shows,  that whatever power a government  (any government) gets 
over it's subjects, becomes abused.

I don't know about the whole "humanity". But an individual, who
claims into that nice chair,  is likely to get corrupted and do
bad things. There is no reasons to invite him to do more damage,
than he can so far.

That's why I wish you stayed with cryptography, rather than
try to "save" the government from dangers nobody yet sees.

Sorry for the harshness, but not for the contents.

As several people showed already, that so-much-feared "new ditigal era"
isn't really going to make it harder for lawenforcer to go after EACH
PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL (using "traditional" techniques, as EME 
monitoring, bugging premises/cars/equipment/etc, and so on
and so forth). What it WILL make harder is LARGE-SCALE
spying on the masses.   

"Vacuum-cleaner" approachreally is likely to die out. Isn't law 
enforcement prohibited to use it anyway? So...?

How much success did any government show in regulating ANY substance,
be it illegal information (Nazi and Soviet countries), rum, drugs,
guns, people smuggling, etc.? What makes you think, that crypto
case is any different?

OK, now rest assured he [or his successors] will (:-).
[And if not - they'll be easy game, so why bother
registering all of us good guys? :-]

The price does looks outrageous. I hope it serves also to limit wiretaps
to those really needed for the case [and autorized by the court :-].

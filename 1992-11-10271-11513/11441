The Bank of England recently bought ten banknote scanning machines which
can acquire note serial numbers at a very high speed. This means that all
money paid into any bank can be circulated through a regional processing 
centre and `recognised' before it's paid out again.

According to my sources, the aim of this exercise is to make money 
laundering a bit harder. Of course, once the system's in place the control 
will gradually be tightened up. Arguments about Irish terrorists can reliably
be anticipated, as can all the stuff about drug profits. ATMs which accept
and count banknotes already exist: shop tills will be next.

Think of all the marvellour social benefits that will follow.

Blackmailers, extortionists and the like can be paid in used notes and tracked 
down as soon as they start spending them. IRA people who draw money out of a
bank in Northern Ireland to pay for a year living under cover in Battersea
will draw attention to themselves just as surely as if they flew the tricolor
from their window. Drug squad agents can buy hashish from street vendors all
over England and then watch where the money goes.

Pressure groups, and the courts, can be relied on to spread the benefits of
the Bank of England's foresight to all sectors of society. The national
health service will want to track down prostitutes (and their clients) 
for AIDS tests; the tax man will want his share of their takings (and 
everybody else's); the social workers will want to identify children `at 
risk' of whatever malpractice is currently fashionable in their journals; 
associations of gamekeepers will get civil injunctions ordering the bank to 
rat on everyone who buys fishing tackle out of season; and if you buy a 
dog and don't subsequently buy the services of a vet at least once a year, 
you obviously need a visit from the cruelty inspector.

And you really think the government will abolish cash? In the face of all 
this manifest social good, and all the favours that can be bestowed on
bureaaucratic interests and vocal pressure groups?

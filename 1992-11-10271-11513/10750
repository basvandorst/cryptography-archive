Strike one - you are overlooking (big surprise) the fact that if one of these
minimally effective bandaid solutions is enforced vigorously, it costs; both
in manpower and money which could be spent on more societally useful programs.
If it isn't enforced, it's yet another unenforced (read useless) law.  Well?

This claim has been refuted time and time again in this newsgroup.
You apparently know differently.  Proof please?

Strike three - we have no problem with your desire to waive your rights.
What we do object to is your desire to waive ours.

Uh, hardly, yourself.  This little bit of mislogic is too priceless to pass up.
No one would claim cyanide isn't dangerous.  What they *would* claim is that
given the small number of fatalities due to cyanide each year (non-suicide),
it is a safe chemical to keep around - if you know what you are doing.

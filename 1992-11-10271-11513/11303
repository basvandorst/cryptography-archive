..like, you can't threaten the life of a policeman with an encryption
program.  You can with an Uzi.(sp?)  [To which the anti-crypto forces
say: you can plot in secret behind the encryption program to ambush
the policeman.]  [To which I say: you can plot in secret in an open
field or a Washington parking garage.]

I wish this analogy would get shot down once and for all.  It's incredibly
stupid.  I realize that diplomats and then the military were the first
to use crypto.  The military was the first to use combat boots.  Does that
make combat boots weapons?

I suspect that this is precisely what the FBI is worried about.  It's
going to happen and when it does, wiretapping dies a sad death.


Encrypted phones have been available for years from Switzerland and now
from at least one manufacturer in the USA.  I wonder how many criminals
purchased them already.  They couldn't be too broke to do so, so the price
isn't the blocking factor.


Anybody out there have an uncle in the mafia? ..care to ask him how much
encryption technology is used?

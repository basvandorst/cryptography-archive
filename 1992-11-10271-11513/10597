In a word, worse.  Much worse.  It requires more invasive monitoring
that any previously proposal, it restricts the use of encryption, and
it creates new bureaucracies.

This new proposal is now a variant of the digital telephony bill.
Note that the session key is useless unless the digital contents of
the session are also sent.  So now we have required participation in
both line monitoring _and_ key generation.

I would suggest that curious parties get a hold of the list of
corporate opponents of the digital telephony bill.  This list can be
obtained from the EFF.  It includes AT&T and most, if not all, of the
RBOC's.

Such a new law would also then make certain uses of cryptography
illegal.  All of these uses would pertain to cryptography as used in
communications.  The best use of cryptography is exactly for
communications.  

Let me understate the case to say that this is undesirable.

To summarize, we are going to record session keys and restrict
permanent keys.  Convenient, to say the least.

Such a new law would also require a new bureaucracy to ensure that
switches met type specification.

Another market opportunity: Interop for monitoring equipment!

Thus session key archiving would be another unenforceable crime.

Let's see, copper has a lower density than lead, right?  In that case
this proposal should be named the "uranium balloon."

Allow me now to address Dorothy Denning personally.  It is the opinion
of many here that any kind of prior arrangement for the monitoring of
encrypted communications is inconsistent with the principles of a free
society.  I urge you simply to change your mind on this matter.  To
hold a bad opinion _per se_ is nothing to be ashamed of, and to change
one's opinion away from such an opinion is honorable.  No one will
think less of you for embracing freedom.

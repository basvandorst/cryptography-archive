"Perfect" randomness suggests "true" randomness to me.  In
particular, the restriction to "efficient" statistical tests
does not seem implied.
"Cryptographically strong" is well defined and is actually
descriptive of what is needed, but tends to be a mouthful to
say and a bother to type.
"Unpredictable" is fine, although explinations are sometimes
needed.
"Secure" has connotations that may color discussions.

So all in all, I prefer "unpredictable" followed by
"cryptographically strong", and the latter in cases
where clarity is more important than convenience.

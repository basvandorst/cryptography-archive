Why do you feel guns are oh-so-responsibly handled in the hands of the
elite (read: wealthy/famous via hired guns, police, and military) yet
those same people (bodyguards, etc) are suddenly irresponsible when they
aren't guarding the VIP?  Seems to me the track record of the above
is not much better than the law-abiding citizen.  Are we seeing a bit
of an elitist attitude here?  "I'm OK, but you common rabble are not OK?"

It does seem that so many of these folks (often folks who are very quick
to point out human rights violations of others) are also very quick to
offer up OTHER peoples' rights for sacrifice to support their agenda.
But suggest that THEY give up a right, then listen to them howl!!!!

Or am I just imagining this.... ?

Like gasoline - it isn't a fashionable villan, controls would impact
even those that would propose heavy controls:  Note the lack of outcry
when all those people were murdered by a rampaging fire bomber at that
Happyland club in NYC.  Had a gun been used instead, we would STILL be
hearing about it in the media ...  yet the kill rate exceeded any of
the 'gun rampages' I am familiar with...  Double Standard here?

Law enforcers would not be able to activate a tap.  To quote from the
Digital Telephony proposal: "The legislation does not establish any
independent 'dial-up' authority by which criminal law enforcement 
agencies could effectuate interceptions without the affirmative 
assistance of the providers or operators.  The providers and operators
will continue to make the necessary interconnections or issue the 
necessary switch program instructions to effectuate an interception."

My understanding is that the phone companies keep an audit of all taps.

Section 2519 of Title 18 contains fairly elaborate reporting 
requirements for law enforcement.  The reports go into the annual
"Wiretap Report" which lists the judge, prosecutor, offense specified,
cost, duration, number of intercepts, persons intercepted, 
incriminating intercepts, arrests, trials, motions to suppress, and
convictions for each tap.

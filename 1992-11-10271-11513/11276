Fleming patented penicillin, I believe, and then did whatever to make
it impossible to make $ from the patent.  This, in fact, greatly
delayed the use of penicillin until WWII caused the military to push
its high-volume manufacture.  So, all through the 30s (as I recall)
penicillin wasn't available.

It was not a problem of clinical trials, because no company was pushing
them, only the academic environment.  I don't remember the details, but
I definitely remember this used as an example of how allowing everyone
to use a patent can stop development.  If you want more examples, look
at all of the natural substances with real medical use which aren't
used.  Aloe vera is a great example.  No question it works.  No problems
with toxicity.  No one to put it through clinical trials because you
would go broke.

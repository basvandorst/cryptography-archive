	Forever?  How about if things get tough here and government pay
	is cut but drugs haven't been legalized? A combination of a 
	federal government financial crisis (brought on by the federal
	deficit) and increased corruption brought on by the war on
	drugs could put even the NSA in the pay of mobsters  Columbia 
	and Bolivia have already experienced this level of corruption.  
	It could happen here if we don't clean up our act.

	What do you suppose that they have to occupy themselves now that
	the Ussr is kaput?  They need the practice don't they? ;-)

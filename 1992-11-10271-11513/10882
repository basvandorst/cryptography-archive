We have about doubled the prison population in this country in the
last ten or so years.  Built a lot of prisons.  Spent billions.
Emptied the mental hospitals to find money to do it (indirectly,
but that's about what happened).

I sure don't feel any safer.  Seems to me that all we did with
stiffer sentences and more prisons was increase the supply of
criminals with darn little effect on violent crime.  Has it been
cut by half?  By even 10%?  Do you feel any safer?  I sure don't.

As for our wonderful handgun culture, I think it very interesting
that I am more likely to be blown away by a 13 year old in 
Minneapolis than I am to be blown up by the IRA in London and
probably even in Belfast.  True, no one can keep the IRA disarmed,
but trying does seem to help a little. . .

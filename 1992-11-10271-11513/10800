Some would argue that completely unregulated cryptography was the original
condition of society, and that it is in fact drifting away from there.

This is not merely hair-splitting, but rather a fundemental point about
the origins of rights: Whether they belong to the people and are
restricted by the gov't only as necessary, or whether they are the
property of the gov't, and are granted to the people only as it sees
fit.

Unregulated cryptography may hamper law enforcement, but I cannot see
how it could harm privacy or proprietary interests.

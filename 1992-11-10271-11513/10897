How about a brain for a "thing" to hold it?   A thought, which
hasn't even materialized into words? A smell? A ... <this list

OK, then you can have my diary encrypted by an odd system
invented by me and based on super-mnemo-DES.   The method
itself and the keys are stored in my head. Help yourself.

A. No way.
B. There is no precedent to this, though there were several
   cases, where encrypted materials were involved.   In one
   of them gov't got a good cryptanalist (Mrs. Friedman :-),
   who managed to break the code - but apparently it wasn't
   in court's power to order the plaintexts fom the 
   defendants.

Of course, I wouldn't bet my life on that - if the gov't is going
to take all this bull***t seriously, it will make sure the 
penalties are stiff enough to deter those who normally
obeys the laws (except speed limits, maybe :-), from
violating this stupid one...

I think, that [according to the aforementioned :-] what you say,
contradicts the Constitution.

Huh? What is this all about?!

That's correct. And I remember there were [are?] states, in which
it was [is?] a law to report to the Secret Police immediately 
anybody speaking bad about the gov't... And of course lots
of people did go to jail (or rather, to concentration
camp)... So what I find most irritating about all
this is how too many of Americans are too
err, anti-smart to do thei best to make
such a system possible here... Or do
they really need a sharp boot toe
in the right spot to get wise?

Well, I know of at least one area where it is still possible to convert
large sums of cash into goods of "real value" : jewelry.  My father is a
goldsmith/jeweler in a medium sized town in Iowa, and you would really be
surprised how many people still buy this stuff using cash.  When I was in
high school I would work after school and on weekends during the Christmas
rush helping out in the retail part, and every year several people would
come in and make five to fifteen thousand dollar purchases and when I
totalled up the bill they would pull out a wad of hundreds and pay it. 

These were usually older people (50+), who I assume either did not use or
trust credit cards/checks/banks, "fine, upstanding pillars of the
community" types.   This city was the central shopping/services area
for a large rural community and I figure that many were farmers who had
some distrust of banks or others who dealt with cash a lot, but when you
are 15 it can be quite a shock to have someone give you ten grand in cash
for a diamond necklace and a ring. 

Once they walked out of the store they had a piece of property that was not
going to depreciate very fast...  I went with my father to a jewelry
convention once, and from listening to people talk it seems this is quite
common in the jewelry business and because the big-ticket items have the
most mark-up one can generally assume that sometimes Uncle Sam was not
exactly going to get his full share for the item in question :)   Or at
least that was what they said...

I have always been somewhat amused when the govt. makes car dealers report
these sorts of purchases, while people who deal with precious metals
(jewelry, coins, etc) that are actually _worth something_ seem to be
ignored.  I guess I never thought about it before, but there are several
other businesses such as this where it is possible to make large purchases
in cash and walk out with something that has "real value" (e.g. easy to
resell for a price similar to what you just paid)

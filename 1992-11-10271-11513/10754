    Folks,

    I'm reading this in 'alt.privacy', and I don't think that's quite
    appropriate.  Ditto on 'world' distribution.  Could we move this to a
    more suitable group (only ... no cross-postings).  Thanks much.

    However, while I'm here ...  :-)

    I think what he was saying was more along the lines of this: your
    suggestion is not only not a final solution, it is itself a problem as
    bad or worse than the one you propose to solve.  Given the choice
    between the disease and your medicine, I'll choose the disease.

    Hmmm.  What if I don't feel you can be trusted with, say, a butane
    lighter?  Or a butter knife?  Can I ban those from all people?  Sorry,
    but I'm not willing for *you* to give away *my* rights.

    Help me out here.  If I keep, say, a revolver in my nightstand drawer
    for protection, how often can I be said to have "used" it for that
    protection?  Every night?  Every hour?  Every minute?  Once in my
    lifetime?  Over a million U.S. crimes per year are thwarted by armed
    citizens, and in over 990,000 of them, the gun is not fired.

    Just keepin' things boilin'  :-)

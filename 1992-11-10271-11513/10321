There is no one single correct way of running a society.  In Canada, our way
works for us.  A lot less people get shot here.  And we try and protect
ourselves against the government by getting over 50% of the population to
actually vote in an election.

It might not work in your corner of the planet, but that's not my problem...

I believe in being able to protect my data, until I am presented with a court
order to allow it to be searched.  Linking the issue with gun control doesn't
help the argument at all.

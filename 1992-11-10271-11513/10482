On another newsgroup, there is a lot of discussion about Automatic
Teller Machines and the Personal Identification Number (PIN) associated
with an account/card.  There is controversy about whether or not
an encrypted version of the PIN is encoded onto the magnetic stripe
on the card.

Facts, anyone?

Thanks,
Tom Smith.

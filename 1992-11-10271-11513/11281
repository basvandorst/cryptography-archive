I believe this has been stated in open hearings before Congress.  I 
have a memory of a very little bit of coverage of this on the evening
news that all of these appends have brought back.  Basically, the FBI
is afraid of losing its ability to wire-tap, something we have spent
insufficient time thinking about.  Too much time on warrants and not
enough time and warrant-less intrusion by the FBI, which is on or over
the border of what the law says they can do.  We have come a lot closer
than people think to having the FBI become the KGB.

It seems clear on its face that the FBI is unwilling or unable to consider
the anti-competitive consequences of its request.  Like most organizations,
it will indeed sacrifice the vague general good if it can to secure its
own narrow interests.

And, as I have already mentioned, cellular calls have already been
recorded, with malice aforethought, in the state of Minnesota.  If the
politicians aren't safe, why do you think you are?  The FBI can do a lot
better job of this than political operatives can.

As for people being too lazy to do crypto -- yes, indeed, they are.
Unless it is automatic and out of sight, few will bother with it.  That's
what makes all of this key registration and so forth kind of silly.  Real
criminals, today, don't bother with crypto and very few will in the
future.  Unless the common carriers encrypt, it won't happen.  But, they're
too stingy to spend the couple of bucks (relatively speaking) to secure 
their customer's interests, because not enough of their customers _know_
they're getting burned to demand it.

As for criminals,
they already have a rough and ready, but workable technology.  It is called
keeping the key facts in their head.  They _know_ the government isn't
allowed to extract data from there and they can't go to jail, per se, for
refusing to tell what they know if they are clever.  Why should they go
to a high tech fix when a low tech fix already works?

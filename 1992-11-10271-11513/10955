        Good. Regulation of cryptographic products would probably suit
        everybody. The government would appear to be "doing something"
        and people who wanted secure communications could have it by
        using non-product cryptography. Of course, the government
        might make roll-your-own cryptography illegal. This would
        justify truly outrageous measures to enforce the law ("Gimme
        that notebook kid. - What are all these numbers, eh?.. eh?).
        Whoever gets this one through should be nominated for the
        Harry J. Anslinger Award.

        How about the distinction of being the first person to go to
        jail for selling secret encoder rings to school kids?

        It's hard to roll up a diskette to hide it in the shower rod,
        but I guess we'd work something out... :-)

        Cheers,
                Marc

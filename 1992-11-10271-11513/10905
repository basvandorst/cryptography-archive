Factoring is in both NP and co-NP; unless there's been some stunning
recent developments, nobody knows if factoring is NP-hard.  So
even if P!=NP, factoring might be in P.  Most theorists think
P!=NP, but some very sharp mathematicians think factoring is in P.
I don't understand the nature of the evidence.  But RSA might
indeed be in worse trouble than cryptography in general.

On the other hand, I've heard that serious crypto spooks mostly
laugh at all public key systems, other than RSA with very large
keys (500 digit primes and 1000 digit modulus--that's -decimal- digits).
Crypto schemes based on NPC problems have been broken.

    Remember that polynomial could be x^(10^10), in which case we still
    don't have much to worry about.

Depends on the model of computation that you use.

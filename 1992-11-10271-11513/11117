Exactly.

Before anyone can claim that a digital signature is mine, they need to
refute my potential claim that someone else had access to it.

If they have forced me to register my private key in a registry someplace
where some criminal might have broken in and stolen it, then they
can not prove my authorship beyond a reasonable doubt.

Lest this seem a little too reassuring, I would like to quote one of
the members of the industry committee that established the standards
for authentication and "privacy" for the new generation of digital
cellular telephones. I asked why the government was so strongly
opposed to the secure encryption of the over-the-air part of a
cellular call when they could still go to the telephone company and
tap the land side of the call where it connects with the regular
public telephone network.

The response? A warrant would be required to gain the telephone
company's assistance, and warrants were considered to be "too
impractical" in many cases.

Draw your own conclusions. Professor Denning ought to spend some time
in the real world before making proposals that implicitly trust the
government to follow its own rules.

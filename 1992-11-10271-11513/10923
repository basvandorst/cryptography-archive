        They SAY they believe. Actually, one of the cops is upset that
        this guy has been fooling around with his wife, and he arrived
        with the encrypted file. The key will be "discovered" a little
        later. (Sorry. Unintegrated personal experience intrudes....)

        I have a program in my machine called PARK. It writes random
        garbage over my keyrings and encrypted files, and then itself.
        Can YOU tell the difference between random garbage and
        encrypted data? Are you going to send me to jail for having a
        file of random data on my disk because some cop "believes" it
        was incriminating evidence that he destroyed? It may just
        have been love letters from your mother.

        Cheers,
                Marc

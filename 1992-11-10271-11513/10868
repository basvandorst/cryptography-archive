	Actually, I've had a few positive responses via e-mail :-)

	Very good points.  Actually, if this is true, then I will nix the
	non-disclosure thing.  I'll just request people to e-mail/snail me
	their address, & I'll mail the source code back.

	Actually, between copyrighting and having filed a patent disclosure
	document, I'd not be worried about that :-).  What I was trying to
	do was find a way to disclose the source code w/out "publishing".
	From what you said, just mailing individually might do that -
	problem solved (hopefully).

	I can understand & respect this.  However, it may not be "for
	free".  There's the little matter of the (modest) cash incentive to
	break it (probably about $500). :-)

>in mind that some of us will be unable to sign even if we want to because

	Forgot about that. This might kill the non-disclosure thing.

	Afraid I don't understand what you mean by "on or over the boarder"...
	Do you mean "over the edge?" :->

	Three points: 

	1) I think you have my posts confused with another, similar thread
	posted by Eric (forget his last name) about a friend's crypto
	scheme.  

	2) You're right - I do owe my (hopefully) future customers
	my own, best personal shot.  However, I've done this (and continue
	to do so).  I realize, however, that somebody else might be able to
	see something I'm missing - especially people with more experience
	in the field.  

	3) I have tried my hand at decryption.  I've learned alot from it -
	that I've applied to Rcrypt.  Also, though I'm not a certified
	"expert", I don't think I'm ignorant in the field any more.  I'm
	posting questions, however, because I know I still have a lot to
	learn, and this seems to be a wonderful forum to find help/info.


As usual, thanks for the response,

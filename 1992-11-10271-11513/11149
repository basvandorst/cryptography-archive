 Carl,
 
     1. Regrettably, I'm no longer very young but being very young 
        is not necessarily bad.  Bill Gates was very young, and so 
        was Mozart. 
 
     2. I'm not very drunk, or even very slightly drunk. 
 
     3. I am not trying to cause trouble, unless a simple 
        challenge troubles you. In which case you might want to 
        consult another type of professional.

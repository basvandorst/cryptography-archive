OK, I don't know beans about P and NP.  So, an elementary question:

Do all programs of class P halt?  Your "universal algorithm" seems perilously
close to the "halting" problem and I have never been able to eliminate it
from far simpler cases than P or NP.  Or, is the halting issue kind of a
separate point/issue (ie, the solution is "P" when it works)?

mrose@prufrock.stsci.edu (Mike Rose)  asks how to conveniently
read his PGP mail from a mac, given that he usually gets his mail on
an (insecure) internet host and reads it with a terminal emulator.

One solution to the problem is to use the Post Office Protocol (POP-2
or POP-3), which is designed to solve the problem of reading your mail
from PCs, anonymous workstations in terminal rooms, diskless machines
that get turned off a lot, and other systems that aren't good mailboxes.

The mail server runs a POP server program, which responds to requests
from POP clients for access to specific mailboxes.  The protocol
includes messages for "how many messages in my mailbox", "send me
message #43", "delete message #7", etc.  Outgoing mail FROM the client
is normally sent directly via SMTP, using a From: line claiming to be
at the mail server, though I think POP may be able to do it too.  
This protocol is intended for use over TCP, but could be adapted
trivially to run over other kinds of connections if you write the code.
(Or you could use SLIP to run TCP/IP over RS-232.)

I'm not highly impressed with the authorization method
(which passes passwords over the net, normally in cleartext),
though you could easily enough adapt it for challenge-response
or some flavor of public key by adapting the server's response
to the USER message.   But then you'd have to write an RFC for POP-4 :-)

My department uses a Sun mail server, with a POP-2 client from Sun
(I think it came with PC-NFS or PC-NFS Lifeline Mail),
and the Popper POP-3 server from Berkeley.
For clients, we use Intercon's TCP-Connect II on Macintoshes,
and Sun PC-NFS Lifeline Mail and Win/QVT on DOS and Windows machines.
Eudora is a popular free client for Macs, and there's a
Hypercard-based Mac client that comes with popper.
I assume there are also free clients for DOS; Win/QVT is $40 shareware.

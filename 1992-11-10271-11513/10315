under subpoena by a grand jury, you can be forced to testify about any
knowledge you have of activities being considered by the grand jury.
similarly, refusing to cooperate with law enforcement authorities can
be construed to be withholding of evidence in later criminal
proceedings.

thus the government already has the right to what is in your head.
why is that so different from what is in your computer?

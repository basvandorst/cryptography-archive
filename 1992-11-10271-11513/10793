Marc Vanheyningen * So,  there's some  guy who  they suspect  might be a
                    molester who  has some encrypted files.  How do they
                    know he's one? How do  they know the encrypted stuff
                    pertains to molestation?
                                 = = =

       I don't  know. I don't  pretend to know  how the police  operate.
       They seem  to have a  strong suspicion that  he is. I  doubt they
       know  either  whether  the  stuff  that  is encrypted pertains to
       molestation.  I am bringing the matter forth for discussion.

Marc Vanheyningen * Well,  tell  your  law  enforcement  friend that, if
                    nothing  else, they  could try  to bust  the guy for
                    using unlicensed software...
                                 = = =

       PGP is  readily available. As  for being my  friend. I have  only
       chatted  electronically with  the man  once and  had someone else
       call to  verify his existance.  I will be  talking to him  again.
       However, if I suggest that they bust the guy for using unlicensed
       software  am I  not in  effect 'pirating'  by allowing  PGP to be
       downloaded?

Marc Vanheyningen * More seriously, PGP is  normally used to communicate
                    with other people, not to store stuff personally.
                                 = = =

       Normally,  but,  it  is  quite  handy  to  store  sensitive stuff
       personally  as well.  What is  normal for  you may  or may not be
       normal for other folks as well.

Marc Vanheyningen *   They should  find out with whom  it was being used
                    to communicate (probably  possible) and subpoena the
                    information from them.
                                 = = =

        Right,  if I  am involved  in a  crime I'm  going to incriminate
        myself ?  Sure I'll turn over some innocuous documents...

Marc Vanheyningen * "The  right to  free  speech  includes the  right to
                    speak in a fashion not easily understood by others."

      I agree in our utopian society this is how it should read. Did you
      by chance  read Lan Times  Nov. 10 issue?  There is an  article in
      there  called "Protesting  Privacy" written  by Stephen  Barlas. I
      have contacted the magazine for  permission to re=type the article
      in full for this conference.  If not, I'll post a summary.

      We can  all stick our  head in the  sand here and  say it won't  /
      shouldn't happen.  The bottom line is  there is maneuvering being
      done now that will greatly effect us.

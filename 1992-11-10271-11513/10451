in Nature 299 p802-3 (1982)
Quantum mechanics does NOT require faster than light travell despite
some remarks in the literature. IF the world were classical, then to
mimic quantum results one would (perhaps) need such faster than light
travell, but the world is not classical. ( It's like those people who
persist in believing that the moon is made up of green cheese, which
behaves in a strange manner when picked up by astronauts, so that it
looks like rock. Yes, if you grant the premise then the conclusion
follows but not every premise is valid). Quantum mechanics does not
require faster than light travel. It does however postulate a non-causal
( in the sense of insufficient cause) world, which some, including
Einstein found abhorent. (but then some find the idea of a round earth
abhorent as well.)

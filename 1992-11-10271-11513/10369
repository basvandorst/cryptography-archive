A while back someone posted info on how to ftp and/or telephone RSA
to get a hold of what sounded like a fairly useful overview of
the current state of encryption tech. Could someone repost please?
Especially the phone # (or even a location so I can call directory
info), since the ftp'able version was PostScript-only or something
equally indigestible. Thanks. --Julian Dibbell; julian@well.sf.ca.us

In article: <1ej1fsINN5ad@morrow.stanford.edu> (Castor Fu) states:

>How do people feel about restricting cryptographic privileges of people
 once they have been convicted of a particular set of crimes?

>It seems to me that  once a person has violated certain rules, e.g.
 child molestation, insider trading, etc.  one might restrict their
 access to tools which are particularly useful towards those ends,
 e.g. guns, crypto etc.

I, for one, agree completely with Mr. Fu.  Once a person has been convicted
of a crime the government could outlaw their use of cryptography as a means
of communication.  These would tend to be individuals with a much higher
probability of future wrongdoing than the general public and hence it seems
logical to be more wary of their use of any facilities which would make
future crimes easier to commit.

I would be anxious to get further comments about this proposal.

	Not necessarily; perhaps Phelps is opposed to "solutions"

	An interesting analogy, but not germane. Experience in the
	US has shown that total bans on handguns have no effect
	whatsoever on the availability of handguns to criminals.

	Given this failure, continued interest in bans shows some 
	objective *other* than controlling criminal access to handguns.

	This statement is absurd. How does Unruh propose to
	"control" the ability of a sociopath to commit violent
	acts with his feet and fists, please?

	Registration/banning of fists, perhaps?

<Many of the guns used in crimes are stolen- stolen from all those law
<abiding citizens who never use them. 

	Strawman argument. Many of the guns used in crimes in
	DC are stolen from the *police*. 

	Is Unruh proposing that the police be disarmed, too?

	Furthermore, how does Unruh know how often people he
	has never met use their firearms?

<And if there are more available to steal they are easier to steal.

	Legal availability has little to do with the issue.
	Fully automatic weapons are completely illegal for
	anyone but the military and police in Mexico; somehow,
	the narcotrafficantes obtain them anyway...just as
	they obtain illegal drugs, perhaps.
	
	Closer to Unruh, one wonders how much cocaine is 
	legally available in Vancouver?
	How much cocaine is available to criminals?

	Banning cocaine seems to have failed....

	The Washington, DC gun ban has failed, too...

<> If you simply don't like handguns, fine.  Don't own one.  

<I don't know about the original poster but I don't like them in your, or
<other peoples hands.

	Does this include "the hands" of the police? I assume
	not; why are individuals in blue suits somehow more
	responsible than anyone else?

<Like you I feel that I am infinitely responsible
<and would never never misuse any gun I owned 

	This is interesting; I *know* that I am responsible,
	I do not *feel* that I am responsible.

	There is a difference.

<Unfortunately I do not
<have the same confidence in you, or others , and am willing to give up
<my utterly responsile freedom in order to help protect me from other's
<irresponsibility.

	Unruh is willing to give up *other* *people's* freedom
	for a chimera; mighty generous of him, mighty generous
	indeed.

	Unrah flunks arithmetic.

	I use a firearm on average at least once a week; target
	practice at the range. Following Unruh's formula
	above results in the number zero (0).

	Furthermore, I have been to places where dozens of people
	used firearms almost continuously for hours on end; no
	deaths resulted. Again, following Unruh's formula
	results in the number zero (0).

	Dividing the total number of illegal killings plus total
	accidental deaths by the total number of all firearms usages
	in the US would result in a number far, far smaller 
	than .001%.

	Which simply proves that a gun in the home is safer than
	an automobile in the garage...

	How is Unruh threatened by a cyanide molecule 
	somewhere in the Andromeda Galaxy?

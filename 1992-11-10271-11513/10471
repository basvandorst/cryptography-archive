   Paul, what is the source of your info? I recently saw a documentary 
   segment on CBC Newsworld where a former GCHQ worker claimed that GCHQ was 
   in fact reading the telexes and faxes of it's citizens. Also that it was 
   prone to the abuse of power, particularly in regard to *DICTIONARY*,
   their Key-Word data sifter.

I'm sorry, I should have realised that wry humo{,u}r doesn't work very
well on Usenet.  The official line of both NSA and GCHQ is that they
are each monitoring foreign communications *only*.  Many people
believe those claims to be "economical with the truth", as a
high-ranking UK person once said in a court case.  I merely pointed
out a possible reason for GCHQ taking a particular interest in US
communications.  It might be the case, though I have not the slightest
evidence, that NSA pays more attention to UK comms than, say, France
for reciprocal reasons.

   Something else which brought them (GCHQ) under fire was a category
   of file labelled "Not For Ministerial Eyes". The implication of this was, 
   of course, that GCHQ was *not* answerable to the Parliament, and therefor 
   not the people.

I believe I saw both of these allegations in the British press.  I
suspect that the US people know at least as much about what the NSA is
*really* doing as UK folk know about GCHQ.  Both organizations are
shrouded in mystery; mysteries which have become slightly less in the
last few years, admittedly.  (Oblique comments: does the word "Zircon"
mean anything to you?  Do you know what its current name is, and why
it became of renewed interest a couple of years ago?  Henry -- are you
prepared to answer? 8-)

   While Britain is considered by many to be the most paranoid "democracy" 
   in the "free-world", this seems to be taking it just a little too far!
   If you have information to contradict this, please let me know.

I don't have an informed opinion on the level of paranoia in this
country.  I do wish we had a Freedom of Information Act.  When we have
the ludicrous situation where information is covered by the Official
Secrets Act in the UK but can be obtained in the US under the FOI,
something is awry.

   Also, do you have any idea if (and what) a *Dictionary* is being used by 
   other "powers", and if so in what varieties -- ie, how capable IS this 
   thing!

I have no idea.  If it exists, I suspect it might have tripped on
"Zircon".  Oops!  Done it again 8-)

Paul

Why not just let RIPEM use the environment variables for this stuff?

BTW, if anyone is interested, I have a couple perl programs which allow
RIPEM use with MH reasonably cleanly, although there are a few minor warts.
They provide intelligent handling of headers, however, which most other
scripts I've seen don't do.  I uploaded them, and Mark may make them
available when RIPEM is released.  (I hope it'll be released in time for
computer security day. :-)  Feel free to ask me for them.

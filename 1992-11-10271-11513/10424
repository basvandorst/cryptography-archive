I believe in being able to protect my data. (note period) ...

Hypothetically say I have all my data encrypted with 'mega-DES ]I[' - how will
an "ummm... I can't remember the key, sorry" hold up in court (assuming said
court had the papers they need, etc).  Would that be perjury?  Can they
subpeona a mental construct?  What could they legally do?  (legally as in per
constitution, etc.  Not the FBI's version..)

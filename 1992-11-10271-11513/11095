An article in the July 1992 issue of Cryptologia describes how some
people cracked the codes that are 1 though 6 digits.  The authors
are Ken Shirriff (shirriff@sprite.berkeley.edu), Curt Welch 
(curt@kcwc.com), and Andrew Kinsman (kinsman@ssd.kodak.com).

The VCR+ system is described in some detail in patent applications that
were filed for patent protection outside of the US.  For example, 
see PCT patent application PCT/US89/05806, published in publication
WO 90/07844.  It was published July 12, 1990.

I hope this is helpful.

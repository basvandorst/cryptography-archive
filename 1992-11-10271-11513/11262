Is this really what U.S. citizens want?

If it is, you've gone very far from the ideas and principles of the
Constitution.  Doesn't China currently have a somewhat similar policy
towards it's citizens, ie. supporting capitalism/business but not
individual or political freedom?

If it is not, it makes me wonder where is the problem, ie. what causes
such a great gap between what citizens want and what the government
wants.

Somehow this development doesn't seem isolated.  Take for instance
psychoactive substances - it's illegal to use stuff like amphetamines
as a private citizen, but in the army, when you're part of the
governemnt organization, it's OK.

I agree that, in the end, the techies will win. But the battle could be
horrible, always living on the edge of doom, constant stress, everyone
betraying one another, a moral war of the worst kind before the fall.

A true police state. What gardner@convex.com easily writes above may become
the truth. But the price may be horrible, endless blood of freedom-believing
people. A real war. And you know the equation: in the end everything breaks
down to force, and in many ways the Government holds the force to kill and
to threaten. I wish we had a sophisticated society that was above this petty
moral war. But it constantly proves to me over and over that it will stoop
to the utter depths until mere disagreements become matters of life and
death.

The key is to see it coming soon enough to prepare for its severity without
panic or being swept away by the explosion. Think out all the scenarios NOW
before they happen, so you can act with less emotion than the all-hell-breaks-
loose feeling that will rise as things become utterly incredulous and severely
dangerous as well.

All freedom is paid in blood. In the past, now, and in days to come.

Sorry for the gloom. But sometimes it gets to me how freedome-believing
people do not recognize this to be as serious a precipitating situation as
it is. Pray the resolution comes like what happened in the Soviet Union,
and not like what is likely to happen in a so-called *free* country!!

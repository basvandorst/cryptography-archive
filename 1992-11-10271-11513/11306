i am sure that the common carriers are currently required to encrypt traffic, at, i think the ds-3 level. i know that a few years ago i installed ds-3 encryption devices, make by rockwell communications (collins radio) on a private microwave network. these devices were made to nsa specs and designed for use by common carriers.

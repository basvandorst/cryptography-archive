The problem with interpreting stuff like this is knowing what the
background rate of coincidence is.

The natural rate of coincidence seems to me to be a very important
philosophical problem, rarely discussed.  Can't interpret unique events
without knowing probabilities.  For instance, was there a Kennedy
Assassination conspiracy?  The Warren Commission should have investigated
a dozen other killings in the same detail, and tallied the funny
coicidences in each.  How many ex-marines went to the Soviet Union?
etc.

So, go generate a bunch of random strings, give them to amateur cryptoanalysts
at 4:00AM, see how many interesting interpretations there are?

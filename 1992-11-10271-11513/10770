Peter forwarded this to me this morning.  I thought you should
know about it because of its likely implications for crypto 
regulation.

  CONFIDENTIAL -- For team eyes only
  
  We have completed discussions with our prime candidate for
  Director of the FBI and will make the name public shortly.
  Al asked him explicitly about his technology concerns and how
  the new admin can help.  [Director] said he was concerned about
  the so-called digital telephony proposal which, he says, must be
  passed if the FBI is to continue the same level of service to
  the American people.  Al said he could help out in Congress.
  [Director] said that is not enough.  Currently there is one FBI
  agent for every 12,200 Americans, which means that most phone
  calls cannot be monitored even if FBI wanted to.  He proposed
  hiring 100,000,000 new agents so that one can be assigned full
  time to listen to each American telephone line.  He suggested
  this could be the massive jobs program that Bill has been
  looking for -- it would virtually eliminate unemployment in the
  country and go well beyond his promise to the American people.
  He said that Bill could be known as the most listening
  president the country has ever known.  Al said the idea was
  intriguing and he would discuss it with Bill.

Very well.  Let's look at it.  The patent seems to cover encryption of
messages.  Private encryption of files, even with a "public" key system
seems NOT to be be covered.  Hence, any code which does not include a
mailer is allowable; hence desirable, because it allows further research on
the concepts described in the patent.

As I said, executing the program and then transmitting the encrypted file
is covered.  Use of the program itself, is not.  (And it is clear that the
primary purpose of the code is either to use in violation of the patent or
to discredit the patent, but discrediting the patent IS allowable.)

That's why no US sites make the code available.  The patent is only valid
in the US.  (It's apparently not valid even in Canada, which normally
recognizes US patents, but "software" or "algorithm" patents are NOT
allowable in Canada.)

No, this is not true.   There are two *different* problems here:  knowing
that P=NP, and having an algorithm for SAT (or any previously proved 
NP-complete problem, for that matter).   Don't forget the perfectly valid 
possibility that someone comes up with a non-constructive proof of P=NP --- 
this would be amazingly frustrating though.  Imagine knowing that P=NP, so you
know that polynomial time algorithms exist for all problems in NP,
but you don't know a polynomial time algorithm for any problem previously
shown to be NP-complete!  I think that's what the original poster probably
meant.

Notice I say "previously shown NP-complete problem".  Of course, if P=NP,
then all problems in P are also NP-complete (w.r.t. polynomial time reductions).
Even the simple problem of deciding if any bit of the input is 1 would
be "NP-complete w.r.t. polynomial time reductions" (of course, that statement
wouldn't be interesting any more....).

        We're nothing if not patient. Eventually, the method will
        either surface as a product/publication or vanish into
        deserved obscurity. In the latter case, little time will have
        been wasted on a useless method; in the former, we will all
        get to enjoy playing with something very interesting.

        In the meantime there are other interesting things to play
        with.

        Cheers,
                Marc

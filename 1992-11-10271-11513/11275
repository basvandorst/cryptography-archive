The following URNG was proposed by Blum, Blum and Shub.

Parameter generation:
  Find 2 prime numbers p and q with 
   - (p-1)/2 and (q-1)/2 are also prime, 
     in particular p and q are congruent 3 mod 4.
   - p and q are at least 2^{256}, and p-q is not small.
  Multiply them together: m = pq, and forget p and q.
Then factoring m is infeasible. And there is no efficient algorithm
that decides whether an arbitrary interger x is a quadratic residue
mod m.

Pseudorandom number generation:
  Take a random seed x0 between Sqrt[m] and m, such that gcd(x,m) = 1.
  Calculate a sequence (x_1,...x_n) by x_i = x_{i-1}^2 mod m.
  Output the log2(m) least significant bits from each x_i.

(In fact B, B and S proposed outputting 1 bit from each x_i. The
security of log(n) bits is due to Alexi, Chor, Goldreich and Schnorr.)

For example you could use a 512 bit modulus m and use 8 (or 9)
bits from each x_i. Using such an m and x0, I got the following
sequence of 8 bit numbers:
  68, 16, 233, 95, 221, 111, 147, 18, 117, 143, 6, 162,  
  249, 82, 160, 158, 132, 29, 138, 28, 159, 238, 25,  
  210, 33, 120, 52, 190, 89, 228, 156, 126, 81, 164,  
  114, 86, 37, 180, 163, 130
(Thanks Mathematica!)
Now it's left to you as an exercise to determine m and x0.

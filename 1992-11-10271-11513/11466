Citation, please.  Something like that would need to be published in
the Federal Register to take effect.

Citation, please.

Look -- I'm not arguing that our government is pure and wholesome.  I'm
just asking for some *facts*.  There are enough real enemies to fight
that we can't waste time tilting at windmills.  (Yes, I know the origin
of that phrase, and why it's slightly inapt in this context.)

Want some paranoia?  Stories like that are deliberately planted, as
disinformation, to distract activists from what's really going on, like
key registration proposals and telecommunications backdoors.

No, I don't believe that one, either.  Should I?

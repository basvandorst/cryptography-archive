We weren't discussing accidents. We were discussing Kid X shooting
Kid Y in some kind of 1) juvenile power game, or 2) cops 'n' robbers.

I'm not sure what follows from this.

Maybe I am. You have no way of knowing. In the meantime, you still
have to deal with my anti-gun arguments, because whatever my stance
is on this media glorification, it can't be inconsistent with this
argument. Apples and oranges.

The fact is that plenty of activities, substances, and what-have-you
are banned even though plenty of people don't do or use them. I don't
smoke pot. I don't break into other peoples' computers. I don't
expose myself to old ladies. Like shooting guns, I don't have any
urge to do any of those things. I don't see what that has to do with
whether I should be allowed to, though.

...and I stopped beating my wife, let's see, about two weeks ago.
Really, you don't need to get so fired up that you have to put words
in my mouth.

Quick, I dunno. Sure wouldn't hurt. Let's give it a try.

How many calories do you suppose I'm burning by typing in these
messages? Perhaps I also get a kick out of expressing myself in
the English language -- how do you amortize? It's silly for you
to suggest that I don't devote my energies to preventing other
kinds of accidental death. Perhaps I do, perhaps I don't. It's
not relevant.

I was the guy in high school who wore pink slacks and got beat up
by the football team. How concerned about 'hip' can I be?

This leads into a whole other argument: what's the purpose of a
handgun? I say it was designed solely for killing people. Others
dredge up handgun hunter magazines. Who knows? But it's another
argument, so let's leave it alone for the moment.

It's true that addressing the underlying problems would be the more
elegant solution. But it'll never happen. All we can do at this point
is patch the system. This seems like a good patch to me.

>Of course, all this lacks the appeal of the 'magic bullet':  Just pass

I understand that a ban on handguns would merely be a band-aid. That
doesn't change my preference.

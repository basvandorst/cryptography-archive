I think it was PROVEN in this group, that crypto CAN'T be regulated,
considering the state of the art.  Therefore, it looks like you are
the only one here without an answer to the question.

Considering that infamous FBI "Digital Telephony" proposal, 
I think your statement is wrong.

Sure,  but do they agree, that my communications are OK to 
be encrypted/protected, or do they simply mean, that THEIR 
communications are to be secure?

Again, I think it was SHOWN here, that there's NOTHING left to DECIDE.
Good secure unbreakable crypto IS HERE, WITH US, ALREADY. Of course,
bad guys will use it too, and there isn't a blessed thing you can 
do about it.  [Well, maybe burn all the crypto books, starting
with yours? :-]

Since criminals  aren't bound by laws and regulations,  nor do they
acquire their equipment on legal market, laws and regulations can't
stop them from getting/using things they feel like to use.Therefore
all this whining is futile.    I'm amazed by your ability to run in
circles around this point after it's been refuted so many times...

1) My observation over the past eleven years (which is when I first became  
aware of issues of cryptography) is that if we, as a society and a government,  
are "drifting" towards anything, it's towards regulated (and eviscerated)  
crypto-technology. The only real counterforce to that trend has been the  
efforts of various individuals and small groups to advance and distribute the  
technology, often in the face of subtle and overt pressure not to do so.

2) Understanding the consequences is a simple though-experiment: imagine a  
postal service where neither the gov't nor anyone else had the right nor the  
power to read letters (though they might intercept it and delay or prevent its  
delivery). Might criminals avail themselves of such a system? Yes. Is that a  
serious enough problem to justify shutting down such a system or compromising  
its privacy? No, IMHO. ..bruce..

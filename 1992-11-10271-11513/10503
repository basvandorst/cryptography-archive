 PROBLEM:
    create a secure encryption algorithm which has the following
    characteristics:

    Let 'p' be the plain text.
    Let 'E' be the encryption transformation.
	Let 'c' be the cipher text.

    Require: (for-all p)( (c=E(p)) is a text which appears to be
                                   a plaintext)

    That is, the ciphertext does not appear to be a cipher text.

    Also, there are no auxillary indices or auxillary data of any kind.

    (not being a cryptologist, i'm sure this is not a new problem,
     i just haven't heard of such a tool as the 'E' i'm speculating 
    about here)

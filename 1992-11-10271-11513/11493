It appears that these works were re-printed by

some time in the 1980s.  Some poking around in some university library
card catalogs in Europe turned up a copy of the Friedman / Callimahos
text; I'd guess that an OCLC or RLIN search would pay good dividends on
all three.  Will report back with findings.

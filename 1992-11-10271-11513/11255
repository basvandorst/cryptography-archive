Hugh, Terry, Chris and a host of others have given some very thoughtfull
comments along the lines of how do we keep the government from legistation on
registration or ban of strong cryptography. I have come to respect their
thoughts on the subject.

I think that the time has come to create a White Paper of the position of
'netnews' RE. How Strong Cryptography is of benifit to society and Why it must
be freely available for use, public and private.

To that end let me set down some ground rules that I hope will keep us on
track and prevent the digression to arguments between fractions.

It is my intent to get the ball running in the formulation of this white paper
as a response to those who would attempt remove strong cryptography from the
hands of common citizens. The completed white paper could take the form of a
FAQ or what the will of the netters can come up with.

As this white paper grows (if you all don't shoot it down at birth) we will be
faced with forming a consensus. Let's tackle that as we come to it. I don't
expect to have any central control (from any point) so this is a real challenge
in coorporation.

What good will it do? Well, I expect that we can turn this into a paper that we
can send to our respective elected officials expressing our collective view.
Further the white paper would be of use as a letter to the editor of your local
paper when the point should come up locally and as a starting point on the
education of local government and law enforcement persons on why not to
regulate strong cryptography and how mis-use of cryprography has been
considered in this position.

To get the ball rolling I have taken Hugh Miller's proposal and turned it into
'White Paper on SCIPH version 1' with this post as 'Discussion on SCIPH WP
version 1'.

Regards, Ethan

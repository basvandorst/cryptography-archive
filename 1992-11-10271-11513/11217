You could use cosmic ray detection for the random source too.
Or change keys every encryption session and forget about using
anything other than the simple encryption (XOR). Your key would
just be a 32bit slice of the random bit stream. Heck, we could
even use an ANSI escape code sequence to hold it, seeing as it's
a little hard to remember non-alpha-numeric sequences.

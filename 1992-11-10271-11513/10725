   ================continues from previous message=========

    Apart from the intellectual challenge, the author of NuCrypt says 
    he's offering a fine evening in New York City to anyone capable of 
    decrypting the secret words.  Should you win, you'll have to get to 
    NYC yourself to collect but, once there, there should be no expenses 
    for you well into the wee hours... sounds like an easy big dinner
    to me...


Doesn't sound so great to me.  Let's see \pounds 500 for a free meal?

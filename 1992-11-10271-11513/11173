I like RIPEM, and I hope that it will gain wide use.  To this end, I
would like to see good, well-written scripts which provide a user
interface for it.

I believe that posting scripts for interface to RIPEM when RIPEM hasn't
even been released yet is not a good idea.

Which header do you mean exactly?  Elm normally shows you the From:
header, which cannot be trusted...

I have something I believe works well, although it's written with MH in
mind.  I mentioned it in a previous post, and it's been ftp'd to the
RIPEM site.  It still could use some improvements, such as adding easy
responses to messages; I'll do them when I got time...

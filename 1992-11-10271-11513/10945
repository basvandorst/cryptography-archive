I was going to reply via e-mail, but I can't seem to reach you (and I
forget how normal mail works ;-).  Anyways, maybe some of the other
non-experts will have some other comments...

Also, I did not mean for the original post to come off as an attack on the
FAQ.  I think the FAQ is very informative (esp. to a newcomer).  I would be
willing to help w/ it in any way possible (although I'm obviously not an
expert - more of a serious hobbyist :-)

Now, on to it:

Wasn't trying to contradict you :-)

Good idea.  I'll do that from now on.  How about trying on a new acronym,
too: URNG for Unpredicatble Random Number Generator, to distinguish RNGs
that are designed for cryptography from the typical PRNGs?

Another good point.  Hopefully, via your FAQ, we may get some standardization
of terms, atleast within the newsgroup.  Or is that too much to hope for?

Actually, I was just making sure I wasn't missing something.  From the way
pseudo one time pads are usually frowned upon, I thought I was.  However, I
hadn't found anything in the literature about that, and I'd seen several
proofs of the absolute security of a true one time pad, so I was getting a
bit worried that I'd overlooked something obvious :-(

I'm not sure.  You may want to include a section on randomness, and note
that there is a definite difference between statistical randomness, and
unpredictable in the sense of frustrating analysis.  I think that this is a
sufficiently basic point to include in the FAQ.  Then you could note
that the typical novice's PRNG might very well satisfy statistical
randomness, but probably won't satisfy "unpredicability".  Next you could
show a statistically good PRNG (as I recall, Ax+c and other linear
recurrence equations are actually pretty good statistically, right?), and
show why it wouldn't work as an unpredictable random number generator
(UNRG? :-) However, this might just confuse some of them too much anyways,
and lead to the "Ax+c is OK problem".  It may just be better to let people
that aren't sure about this issue post, like I did.  Anyways, thanks again
for the clarification...

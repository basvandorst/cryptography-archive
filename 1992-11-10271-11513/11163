A license from PKP includes a per copy royalty.  I don't see how this could
be administered with freeware.  In theory I suppose someone could act as
an intermediary and obtain a license from PKP to sell licenses to individual
users who wish a license for PGP and the intermediary would be the only one
directly dealing with PKP and paying it the royalties.  This might be a nice
litle business for someone if PKP were amenable to it and enough users
wanted it.

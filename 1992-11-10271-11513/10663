 I'm curious.  Why not?  

 If the goal is to make society safer, clearly the problem to be addressed is
  violent crime, of all sorts.  Banning handguns isn't gonna solve it - but
  you already know that!

 If the goal is to force your views and beliefs on millions of other people, then
  i'd have to respectfully ask you to think about the consequences of your
  actions;  this country is based on freedom and liberty - not conformity.  
  I respect your rights, but i demand the same consideration in return.  

 If you simply don't like handguns, fine.  Don't own one.  

 If you feel that they are just too dangerous for people to own, consider the
  numbers - there are about 200 million handguns in the US, and about 12000 
  firearms homicides per year, and 1400 accidental firarms deaths.  That makes
  firearms safer than automobiles.

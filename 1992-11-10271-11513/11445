The government quietly lowered the size of transactions which must be
reported to something in the neighborhood of $2000. I've also heard
that jusk ASKING what the limit is at a bank will get your name sent to
the FEDS for future investigation. Also, it is now impossible to buy
laboratory equipment for cash. The reason is that the DEA requires the
companies selling such stuff to keep complete records of sales so the
DEA can investigate anyone buying such items for possible drug
dealings.

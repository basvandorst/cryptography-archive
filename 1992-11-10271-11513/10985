 Suppose the issue is *not* (necessarily) giving the government keys
 in advance, but rather "providing access *after* due process":  The
 Constitution specifically provides that people are secure only from
 *unreasonable* search and seizure, and this certainly implies that
 *reasonable* search and seizure is accepted and constitutional.

 If government agents *have* a warrant, would an attempt to prevent
 their entry into a house be considered "legal"?  Is secretly-held
 information really different from other "effects" mentioned in the
 Fourth Amendment?

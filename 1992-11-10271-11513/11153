 OK, how many words/letters would you like?

 We'll give you as much text as you want (within reason - please!). 
 You choose the plaintext. We can guarantee that the unknown word 
 will also be found among the known ones. [But please don't ask 
 for a two-word file then!  :-) ] 
 
 Or you could submit some pattern of your own, such as a numerical 
 or alphabetic progression of any kind, any length. Or a large file 
 consisting of nothing but zeroes, with one set of eight non-zero 
 characters embedded in the middle. (Try that on RSA or DES).  Name 
 your poison. One smart cookie has already asked for a set of
 files incorporating a slowly-changing alphabetic progression...

 Thanks.  WE are going to try.

 We've asked no one to make such a judgement. We only want to know 
 whether the experts here can break an encrypted message where only 
 ONE WORD is not disclosed, under fair terms, or even terms of their 
 own choosing. 
 
 In any case, I can't _force him_ to post anything, but he might 
 very well decide to do so. I sure hope he does, because you guys 
 are beating the bejesus out of me.  I can't take this any more!  
 Aaaarrrgghhh..!!  :-)

Finally -- we may have the source of the misunderstanding.

There exist people in this world who like to break cryptograms.  The
American Cryptogram Association (sp?) is one such collection of people.

sci.crypt readers are not, generally, in that group of people.

We are cryptologists (those of us who have experience in the field).  We
have done cryptanalysis but we aren't the puzzle wonks who just love to get
their teeth into some new ciphertext to break.  We analyze cryptosystems --
openly published ones.  We design protocols using cryptosystems.  We talk
(endlessly) about things like registration of keys.

...but, we don't solve puzzles.

This phrasing is again that of a taunt.  You come across as a high school
kid when you talk like this.  If you were to expect any help at all, this
would guarantee your losing it.


----------

In closing, let me reiterate that any serious cryptosystem must withstand
analysis with the entire system open to inspection.  Any success in
avoiding cryptanalysis from ciphertext only does not imply quality of
the system.

Therefore, even if you were to find a puzzle hacker on this newsgroup who
would like to take a stab at what you're suggesting, you would have proved
nothing about the quality of the system (unless it got broken, of course :-).

 Please learn how to quote and then respond to the quotes.

 Actually, my proposal is probably one of the *best* we can hope
 for.  Without cogent arguments *supporting* the widespread public
 use of cryptography, we may get much less.

 Since when does a proposal have to be "justified"?  And do you
 expect legislative action to meet your standards of justification?

 Well, at least that's something.

 Who is "they" and how do you know "them" well enough to know
 their motives?

 Is it really "them" against "us," or might some of "them" be
 equally interested in the future of the country?

 Surveillance might be something that the American public will
 no longer support either morally or economically, provided that
 we can arrange to have the issue placed before them.

>or conceeding, that demons are at issue.

 Provided that we are able to escape a serious crackdown on the
 public use of cryptography, we still have to live here.  Thus, it
 might be wise to consider beforehand how the unrestricted use of
 cryptography could affect our society.  I believe there may well
 be serious social problems in widespread totally unrestricted use.

 I don't know what this means.

 I don't recall.  If you would quote the reference, we wouldn't
 *have* to "recall the thread."

 I have no idea how to interpret this junk.  Have you considered
 taking up revivalist preaching?

 Call me crazy, but did you read my stuff?  My proposal would not
 support illegal wire-taps, because it would demand that users open
 up their ciphers on their own *after* due process.


>Mostly, the issue is one of the efficiency of signals intelligence.

 Again, signals intelligence against civilians (even through the
 back door, e.g., British Intelligence) may no longer be supportable,
 if we can bring the issue to the attention of the American people.
 There is no free lunch:  If it is happening, we are paying for it.

 That is an assumption which I believe is false, provided that
 someone wants--and has the resources--to keep their traffic secret
 badly enough.

>afraid that they cannot efficiently identify which traffic
>they want to read from a great deal of trivially encrypted
>traffic.

 Well, if "they" are worried about this, "they" may try to get
 legislation to "solve" "their" problem.  Turning our attention to
 this possibility, and thinking about what we could do about it,
 was the main reason for my original posting.

 The signals intelligence activities which were appropriate during
 the Cold War may no longer be morally or economically supportable.
 Thus, proposals to recover the old capabilities *might* be defeated
 (at least in principle), by an open and logical legislative
 discussion on the merits.  Preparation for such discussions was the
 point of the original thread.

 When "they" maneuver for legislative support, we can expect "them"
 to seek out "their" traditional buddies:  Law-enforcement.  My
 examination of issues important to law-enforcement indicates to
 me that some real problems may exist.  In order to break that
 alliance, we will have to address those problems.  Thus, my
 proposal.

 I don't want to *resist*; I expect to *win*.  Eventually.  But
 that doesn't necessarily mean the absolutely free and unrestricted
 use of cryptography in all cases.


>You cannot win if you permit them to pretend
>that the issue is demons.

 Actually, we cannot win if we allow our arguments to be defined
 by "them," nor can we win if we space-out into incomprehensible
 gibberish about "demons" and "them."

 Uh huh.

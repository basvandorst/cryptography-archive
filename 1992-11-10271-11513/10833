	I bet cryptography will have very little impact.  Most of the 
	people involved	in the market are quite capable of talking to 
	each other in person.  Even if they work at opposite ends of the
	country, it is simple enough to pre-arrange spoken codes that
	can be used with impunity on open telephone lines.   Alternatively
	faxed correspondence could have buy/sell info encoded in such
	seemingly innocuous things as the secretary's initials at the 
	bottom of the page.  The mathematical theory of cryptanalysis 
	makes a great number of assumptions about the nature of the 
	communications that would not apply to such idiosyncratic systems.
	If I were an inside trader, I would hide my dirty deals in plain
	sight.  Paradoxically it is safer.

	In a word: Yes.

}What if RSA brings a patent infringement suit against you?  It's not as
}simple as you paint it.  You can't simply "refuse to deal" with RSA if
}you're using public key encryption in the US.

What I meant was that you don't have to use public key encryption.  Patents
are irrelevant (and I don't believe in 'em, anyways.  Copyright, yes, patents,
no).  You and RSA are both freely contracting parties.  However, if you want
to use RSA in a prohibited fashion, you have no choice about whether you will
deal with the enforcement agency of that prohibition.

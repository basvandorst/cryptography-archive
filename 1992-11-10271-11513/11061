Not to get too practical here, but as a UNIX system administrator, I am
starting to become concerned about being able to trust the mail I receive and
that further my users should be able to trust the mail I send them.

I am familiar with the basic concepts of Public Key Cryptography and have
even downloaded the PGP-2.0 package for UNIX.  (Although I have not yet
bothered to start compiling it.)  The reason for my delay is that although
PGP-2.0 will provide the security level I am interested in, it is not
well integrated with the (/bin/mail or NeXT Mail) mail programs.

So, I have these very practical questions:
	What program(s) would you recommend for public key encyption
		of mail on UNIX systems, especially NeXT, running 3.0?

	Where can I download the source/binary of this/these program(s)?

Please feel free to post responses to the group.

With the implication that therefore the military controls the discussions
about cryptology?  Spare me.  If nothing else, they're not that stupid.
There are too many other people on the program committee, and there are
too many other venues to present such papers, including non-U.S. ones.
I'm certainly not saying that the U.S. government doesn't try to suppress
some cryptographic ideas -- obviously, they do -- but that isn't one
of their mechanisms.

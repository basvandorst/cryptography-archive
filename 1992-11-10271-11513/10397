You mention Gotti in your post, but you still haven't answered the fundamental
question I asked. I'll ask it again:

    "If key registration were mandatory, would John Gotti register his keys?"

I say the answer is NO.

And I further say that having ANY sort of punishment for "using unregistered
keys" is a gross infringement of our constitutional rights.

Just because nobody has proposed "other approaches that would give greater
assurance ..." doesn't mean that your proposal is a good one.

    Excuse me, for I am really an amateur in this subject, but I
don't see the chain of reasoning here.  If I am just being particularly
dense, please keeps the flames low, and I'll shut up.

    What has been shown is that iteration of DES with different keys 
results, in general, in encryption which is different from DES.  I 
believe that that is different from showing that iteration results
in something _stronger_.  As far as I can see, it is consistent
with someone discovering that two applications of DES could result
in a encryption which is in fact easier to break -- for example,
there could be some interaction between keys, that would result in
an easy cipher to break, so that there would have to be some care
in choosing keys.  It is also consistent with it being discovered
that iterations of DES are _equally_ difficult to break as single 
uses, perhaps just a different method has to be used.

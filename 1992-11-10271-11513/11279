I am probably either the zillionth person to suggest this or the 
fact that it is 4:00am has had a greater effect on me than I realize
but here goes -

As I look at "ABFDEFGHIIJKLMMNOHPP" I can read it almost naturally as
_Nosy? I am happy!_ by "reading" all of the out of place letters.
No C [replaced by the F], I [extra I] AM [extra M] happy [HP].

I, of course, would read that as a taunt by the writer of the cipher
basicly saying "GOTCHA".

So what about it folks - how badly do I need some sleep?

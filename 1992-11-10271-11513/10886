 I assume that the police would have some reason to so believe.
 These kind of cases are always difficult; the question: "Did he
 touch you--down there?" can mean different things to adults and
 children.  Then the adults can become irrational, and then that
 will influence the kids.

 But choose your own worst case.  We are discussing arguments which
 could be used to lead to laws limiting the use of cryptography.

 The issue under discussion is the possibility that a future
 society could regard hiding information, after due process,
 as a crime in itself.

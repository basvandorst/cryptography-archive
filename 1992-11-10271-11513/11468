Precisely.  Want an "unplesant result"?  Get involved in a lawsuit and have ALL
of your bank records subpeonaed.  Can't happen?  Think again.  I just finished
my divorce.  In addition to supplying them with all of the bank/loan/credit
card/business/any other financial paperwork they could think of which I had in
my possession, they legally obtained my records directly from the bank. 
Suddenly I was faced with having to justify all my spending to the other side. 
Luckily for me, my bank does not keep photocopies of checks written, only
account numbers to which they were deposited.  Much more difficult to trace.

Of course, we subpeonaed her credit card records, only to find out that she and
her boyfriend applied for the VISA gold card one month after she left me (she
claimed she wasn't seeing him until 5 months after the date of the
application).  We also obtained all of the statements and photocopies of the
checks used to pay their bills.  It worked out quite well for me, needless to
say.

I've learned that ANY transaction, no matter what it may be, that I don't want
showing up in a bank record, gets made in cash.  If cash is banned, we're all
fucked, I don't care how much more convienient a non-cash system would be.  In
fact I make almost all of my transactions in cash these days, except for bill
payments which must be made through the mail.

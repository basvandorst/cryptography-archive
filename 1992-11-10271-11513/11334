   There is a newsgroup called comp.society.privacy, that deals with the
effect of technology on privacy.  The recent discussion on registering of
keys would have been appropriate for that newsgroups.  I am the moderator
of it.  I am enclosing a little info on the group.

   I am the moderator of the Computer Privacy Digest.  The computer 
   Privacy Digest is an Internet mailing list that is dedicated to the 
   discussion of how technology impacts privacy.  This list is gatewayed 
   into the moderated USENET newsgroup comp.society.privacy.  In lot of 
   ways it is a subsection on the risks digest but it concentrates on 
   the risks of technology on privacy.  The charter is: 
  
   comp.society.privacy    Effects of technology on privacy (Moderated) 
  
   This newsgroup is to provide a forum for discussion on the effect of 
   technology on privacy. All too often technology is way ahead of the 
   law and society as it presents us with new devices and 
   applications.  Technology can enhance and detract from privacy. 
   This newsgroup will be gatewayed to an internet mailing list. 
  
   Submissions go to: comp-privacy@pica.army.mil and administrative 
   requests go to comp-privacy-request@pica.army.mil.

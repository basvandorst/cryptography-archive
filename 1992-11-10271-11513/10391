}But how many times, say in the last 200 years, have guns be used against

Widely distributed firearms ownership is an insurance policy against tyranny.
Insurance policies shouldn't have to be used to be justified.

I sympathize with your desire to portray cryptography positively to people,
but there is necessity to defend freedom of communication here and now.  Did
you know that the US State Department is preventing the former Eastern Bloc
from leapfrogging us to fiber-optic cable because it's too difficult for them
to bug?

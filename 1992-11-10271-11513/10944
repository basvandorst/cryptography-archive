No, you misunderstand me.  I think there is no need for a new law
at all.  I am not a legal expert, but I think that only information
in one's own brain is exempt from involuntary surrender.  Else, why
have search warrants in the first place?

But, whatever the state of the law actually is, I don't see any
reason that cryptography requires any _special_ treatment.  It just
isn't really different than a wall safe.

We can have a separate argument about whether we should allow
search warrants at all or require any cooperation whatsoever with
the authorities under the Fifth Amendment; my only real purpose was
to demonstrate cryptography has nothing to do with the argument.

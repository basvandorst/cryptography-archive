If anyone really thought that gun theft was a serious issue, they'd
enforce the relevant laws.  They'd encourage reporting.  However, the
reality is different.  Gun theft is a "free" crime - people who commit
it aren't punished.  Moreover, people who report it ARE punished.

A few weeks ago, there was a big story about a UPS-theft ring.  A
worker at a UPS facility was stealing gun shipments.  The US attorney
involved got on the tube screaming about how gun manufacturers didn't
report this sort of crime and how once they found out about it, they
solved it right away.  He used this to argue for a proposed new law.

Reality was a bit different.  The gun manufacturers reported the first
shipment stolen.  They reported every subsequent stolen shipment.
They were ignored.  They started investigating themselves and despite
not having useful investigative authority, narrowed things down so it
was a simple matter to find the thief.  All the time they kept
reporting both the thefts and what they'd found out.  Finally, the US
attorney decides to get involved and grab all the glory.

Any day you folks want to take gun theft seriously, you can do so.
Until you do, don't whine at me about it.

Sure.  There are billions of shots taken each year.  50% of US
households have guns.

Guns are still safer.

You are missing the point.

Put yourself in the position of the "Law & Order Kingpin". The president is
telling you to shutdown money laundering, the media is screaming; what would
you do? Well, as you observed, laundering turns cash into electron blips; so
we will just ban cash - problem solved. The fact that drugs are still bought
and that drug money can now move faster is irrelavent to your promotion.
Also, the citizens (and the media) will now be "involved" in the "cause",
and having been inconvienenced, they won't be quite so vocal the next time.

[Gee, I am a real cynic, aren't I?]

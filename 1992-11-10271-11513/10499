Actually, this is false. There have been no such rulings to my
knowledge. There has simply been an effort to out and out ignore the
second amendment. The last case that I know of that successfully
reached the supreme court was the Miller case in the 1930s, in which
it was ruled that since the guy claiming the right to own a sawed-off
shotgun hadn't shown up (their side literally did not appear), the
court would assume that the weapon was not a military one and thus
might not be covered. You heard that bit right, by the way -- the
ruling implied that it is military weaponry, and not sporting
weaponry, that is covered by the amendment. However, as all of this
has gone completely away from the original topic, I suggest those who
are interested take it up in talk.politics.guns instead.

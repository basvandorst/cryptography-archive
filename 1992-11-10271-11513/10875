I'm interested in cryptography, but know almost nothing about what sort of
algorithms being used now.  I have heard of such things as Public Keys, PGP,
and RSA, but know nothing of how they work.

Can anyone give a brief explanation of what a Public Key is? What are PGP and
RSA?  Any info I could get at the library?

Thanks

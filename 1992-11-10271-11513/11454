Aren't checks contributing to a cashless society already?  I mean, I
have no cash on me, and I want to buy groceries.  I write a check and
the money just _disappears_ from my bank account (they tell me once a
month how much disappeared and when, but I would also expect monthly
statements showing the activity on a hypthetical cash card).  The
effective balance shown in my checkbook is not that different from the
bank balance showing on the front of my hypothetical smart cash card.

The thing to really watch out for is "smart money" -- thin green
plastic cash-shaped objects whose denomination slowly changes to
reflect inflation :-).  Spend it fast before it loses too much value!

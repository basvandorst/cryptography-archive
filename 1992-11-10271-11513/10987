 OK, choose your own worst case.  The point here is to be able to
 confront the worst arguments the other side can muster, and so
 legitimately influence legislation.  Blustering won't do it.

 If you wish to wait until *after* some of us are arrested and put
 lots lawyer's kids through school to hope for the courts to throw
 out a law restricting cryptography, be my guest.  Frankly, I think
 it more appropriate to understand what a reasonable position would
 be, and push that, in opposition to more radical proposals for
 extensive regulation or simply shouting "Just say NO."

 Again, blustering won't do it.  What we need are cogent arguments
 which recognize any legitimate concerns society may have about
 the unregulated widespread use of this new technology.

 It appears to me that society may indeed have some legitimate
 concerns which are rooted in common law and The Constitution.
 If we can successfully argue that individual freedoms are more
 important, perhaps we can avoid regulation.  But first we must
 understand those concerns, see how real they are, and how the
 usual voter and legislator are likely to view the situation.

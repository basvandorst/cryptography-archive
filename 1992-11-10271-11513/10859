I just use ForYourEyesOnly that came as a 2.0 Demo app...  It's a
NeXTSTEP app, you can insert files (but not directories, sigh) and use
different fonts like NeXTmail, you can mail the ciphertext from the
services menu, and...... it's legal to use in the US (whereas PGP
(Pretty Good Privacy) is very ILLEGAL in the US).

It uses FEE.  Well it at least uses EE.  It's not all that blazingly
fast, but it works great!

my FYEO public key:

send me some encrypted mail and piss the NSA off...  :-)  I think I'll
put it in my .sig... hehe

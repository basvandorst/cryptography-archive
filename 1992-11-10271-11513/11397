I believe that Fleming made the patent for penicillin public, which delayed
development for many years.  No drug company wanted to invest the $
on development and clinical testing when anybody else could ride on
the investment and undercut their prices.  A sure route to bankruptcy.

This is a system design issue.  You guys are argueing about waves,
not wave-generation mechanisms.

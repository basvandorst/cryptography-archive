There would have been little difference.  Corporations are required to
keep certain books, have them audited, etc., and have the records 
available.  Nothing now physically prevents such a firm from having
its bookkeeper keep the "real" books in a highly secret place, in such
a way that it is not available to anybody without major contortions, and
having a public set of books entirely different.  If, say, only the
bookkeeper and the CEO are even aware of it, and they can keep secrets,
how would the government even know about it?

It is only the law, and the insistence of officers in a firm, which
even require that anything like honest books be kept.  Make it too
hard to keep an accurate backup, and devices to at least have approximate
assessments of what really happened, and to give only a false image to the
public, will be produced.  Other than brainwashing those with information,
or some other procedure which gets out what they do not want to tell, will
get this information, anyhow.

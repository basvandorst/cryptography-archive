One-time pads are much harder to ban than other encryption techniques,
simply because any easily duplicated source of digital bits can be used.
They can't ban the use of CD players, so they can't stop it.

By themselves, book cyphers are not particularly secure, because they can be
subjected to lots of pattern-matching, but even if you've registered your keys
and your Pink Floyd CDs, *they've* got to check all the combinations, 
while you and your friend know to play the disk backwards from the end of
"A Saucerful of Secrets" and feed it through DES to get the one-time pad.

If this were sci.crypt.humor, I'd probably say something about Tipper Gore ...
Meanwhile, if you've got to register your musical one-time-pads anyway,
might as well give them the old scratchy vinyl records instead of the new CDs :-)

 I abjectly apologize for any perceived offense. It was not my 
 intention to offend, only to test. Do you find testing offensive?

 Not a chance, at least for the time being. Posting such information 
 here would automatically make it a public-domain program, not to 
 speak of other implications. Not quite ready to do such a thing.

 What could be easier than discovering ONE SINGLE SHORT ENGLISH
 WORD in the context of hundreds of English words whose plain
 and encrypted equivalents will all be supplied to you? C'mon,
 you probably could guess it just by *looking* at the file!
 
 I mean, if a cryptologist can't do THAT, what good is cryptology?
 Why mess around with all the DES and RSA and PGP stuff? You can't
 even decrypt ONE SINGLE SHORT WORD in the midst of hundreds?
 Gosh.

 Then let's say that I no longer want you to tell me how strong it 
 is, or how weak. I just would like to know whether you can pass a 
 childishly simple test. (That's really not what I had in mind when
 I posted the original challenge, but the conversation here seems to 
 be boiling down to such simplistic approach...)

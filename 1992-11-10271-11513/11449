This is substantially the same as the ElGamal public key cryptosystem.
There, however, the sender chooses a random k and sends g^k mod P along
with the encrypted message. Both the sender and recipient share the secret
(g^k)^e mod P, where e is the recipient's secret key. This way there is a
new key chosen automatically for each transmission. 

With respect to the original poster's intention to avoid patents, I am not
sure whether or not the ElGamal cryptosystem is patented. It was published 
along with his signature scheme in Trans IT in 1985.

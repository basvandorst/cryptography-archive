Carl Ellison gave a good description of the algorithm I had in mind.
One possible extension would be for the parties to pass their values
both ways around the loop for redundancy, but this would increase the
overhead.

While I appreciate that some people prefer to answer the question
"can/should crypto be regulated" with a blanket NO, I prefer to first
get a better idea of what crypto options might be available and the 
conditions, if any, under which they might be appropriate.  I am also
not content to let society drift in the direction of completely 
unregulated crypto without attempting to understand the consequences
of that from the view of LE as well as the view of protecting privacy
and proprietary interests.

Whatever regulation, if any, might be considered, it would seem that
it would have to be aimed mostly at crypto products, not use.

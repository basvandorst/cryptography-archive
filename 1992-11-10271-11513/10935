	Clearly you are correct about the effect of civil forfeiture on
	the bill of rights. When do you suppose people will wake up to 
	realize that their constitution has been effectively abolished and 
	do something about it?  When will the (hopefully) bloodless 2nd 
	American revolution happen?  

	Do you think anyone cares about real freedom anymore or is it
	just a pretty word that they talk about?  Do we really believe
	it is necessary to make sacrifices for freedom or is that
	just part of the ceremony on Veterans day?  Are Americans worthy
	of their constitution or have they become too complacent and
	willing to accomodate themselves to any government outrage as
	long as their creature comforts are preserved?

At least two readers (in my reading so far) have complained about my
comments about registering cars not being a prelude to confiscation.
Note carefully that in my original statement I said 'except when
associated with a law violation' or words to that effect.

Those who would oppose registration because it would make it easier to
enforce laws should direct their attention to the laws, not the
registration. Otherwise they are advocating making law violation
easier.  The proper place to oppose "improper" laws is in the
law-making process, and subsequently in the courts, not in the
"registration" arena, unless registration itself is, say,
unconstitutional. If it is, then the grounds for opposition are
constitutional, not that it's "been shown" (I say it hasn't) that
registration is usually a prelude to confiscation.

Those who argue against registration on grounds that it might make it
easier for the government to enforce laws are on very shaky moral
and ethical grounds, in my view.

"P.C." needs for crytography...

* protection of communication between homosexuals who wish to
  remain in the closet, especially those in the armed forces
* abortion supporters and doctors who perform abortions in the
  Mid-West to avoid persecution from mobs of fundies
* communication between Wiccans in the broom closet
* the need for secure communication between radical political
  groups, or environmental groups who wish to avoid eavesdropping
  by large, polluting organizations

* communication networks in this country are becoming to large to
  provide any amount of physical security, especially with 
  microwave and satellite links.  Anyone could be listening in
  anywhere (not just the government, they're way down on my list
  of people I'd worry about)     

I'm suprised your average "bleeding-heart" liberal would ever
think cryptography is not neccessary.  Of course, they might
have some weird connection in their minds about guns and 
crypto. (Or that "crypto" stuff is just part of the mean
old military industrial complex).

Well, let me go on record as saying I personally will uphold
my rights to be secure in my papers, no matter if it is the
left or the right or the center that tries to take it away.

For what it's worth, the ATM systems I use seem to bundle the whole 
transaction (PIN and all) and send it off when you're done telling it what
to do. It doesn't tell that you put in the wrong PIN until after you've
finished telling it what account/how much. At that point it either gives
you money, or tells you the transaction failed. It usually takes less than
5 seconds.

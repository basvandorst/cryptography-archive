Paul, what is the source of your info? I recently saw a documentary 
segment on CBC Newsworld where a former GCHQ worker claimed that GCHQ was 
in fact reading the telexes and faxes of it's citizens. Also that it was 
prone to the abuse of power, particularly in regard to *DICTIONARY*,
their Key-Word data sifter.

Something else which brought them (GCHQ) under fire was a category
of file labelled "Not For Ministerial Eyes". The implication of this was, 
of course, that GCHQ was *not* answerable to the Parliament, and therefor 
not the people.

While Britain is considered by many to be the most paranoid "democracy" 
in the "free-world", this seems to be taking it just a little too far!
If you have information to contradict this, please let me know.

Also, do you have any idea if (and what) a *Dictionary* is being used by 
other "powers", and if so in what varieties -- ie, how capable IS this 
thing!

Thanks for your time,

Owen

 I don't *want* anything of the kind.  In fact, what *I* want is
 largely irrelevant.

 Is this the argument *you* would use against proposed legislation?
 Do you expect it to be effective?

 I have formulated a proposal which is arguably less offensive
 than prior key registration, and which arguably continues the
 existing relationship between law enforcement and society under
 the Fourth Amendment.

 I see this as a possible "fall back" position.  I do not think
 we will get out of this without *some* limiting legislation.

 I don't care *what* you ignore.  (I do have suggestions . . . .)

 But if *you* ignore the ability of a future government to penalize
 you for *using* said escaped djinn, you do so at your own risk.

 The issue is not that other countries already have access to the
 technology; nor is it about banning the use of cryptography.  The
 issue is whether individuals in the U.S. will be able to use that
 technology in the U.S. *without limit*.  Drivers are licensed, so
 are transmitter operators; cryptographers could be as well.

 It is a "rhetorical trick" to try and see things from another
 point of view?

 Feel free to question my motives; I certainly question those of
 anyone who threatens to question mine.

 Frankly, I find that the politics of division, "my side vs. your
 side," and motive questioning, to be ways to *silence* the truth,
 rather than expose it.

 I have been well known on sci.crypt for over three years; I have
 published three papers in Cryptologia; I hold the U.S. patent on
 Dynamic Substitution technology; I released full source for demo
 programs and my full-blown CLOAK cipher on U.S. sci.crypt, and my
 writings are known for championing the individual vs. government
 and corporations back to my 6809 days with Motorola.  If you do
 not find my views Politically Correct, perhaps you should change
 your standards.

 Do you find the discussion threatening?  SEEK PROFESSIONAL HELP!

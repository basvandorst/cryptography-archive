To Larry Loen,

I tried to e-mail you a reply/some comments to one of your posts, but my
mail got bounced.  Could you e-mail me your e-mail address? (sounds like
yuppie-speak: fax me a fax of your fax # so I can fax you... :-).  The
"From" address given in the post (lwloen@rchland.vnet.ibm.com) didn't work.

Thanks,
Dane Butzer

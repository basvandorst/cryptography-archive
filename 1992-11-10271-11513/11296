No.  This concedes legitimacy to government involvement in the matter.
The peaceful use of cryptography is naturally a matter of personal
choice, and running to government for permission to use it is akin to
a child asking its parent for permission to use the toilet.

If you wonder how government insinuates itself into every department
of human existence, here's your answer.  Well-meaning people _invite_
it in, even _implore_ it to enter.

Your response may be that they're going to get involved anyway, so we
might as well be ready for them.  Yes, and that makes this white paper
a worthwhile project, _if_ it is used to _defend_ personal choice
against collective dictate (government), not if it's used to negotiate
that choice away.

This language exhibits US National chauvinism, both explicitly
("American business") and implicitly (unqualified use of
"Congressional" and "FBI").  If this white paper is to convey the
consensus of freedom-loving people, it cannot imply the granting of
jurisdiction in these matters to any government at all, and certainly
not specifically to the US government.

Please see my letter published in the April issue of Communications of
the ACM for further amplification on this point.  In it, I criticize
the CACM editors for implicitly endorsing an intensely nationalistic
stance on cryptography.  I also note there that cryptography presents
a fertile opportunity for a renewed flowering of freedom, in spite of
the heavy hand of political government.

Who is the "end-user" being referenced here?  I think this should be
explicit.

What is the "cost" of personal choice being supplanted by collective
dictate in yet another department of life?

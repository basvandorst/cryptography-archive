Try again.  By that definition of "reasonable", there are no
reasonable society because the proposed measures haven't
provided those benefits....

That's not the relevant measure.  The hypothesis is tested by
the existence of an oppressed country where the populace was
NOT disarmed.

The question isn't whether gun-banning necessarily leads to
oppression, but whether oppression can happen absent gun-banning.

Talk about it all you want, but it still isn't a significant problem.

>5% sounds to me like a lot less than the present percentage,

Which demonstrates that Gontier doesn't know much about the
present percentage.  Moreover, it demonstrates that he doesn't
understand how many criminals there are.  If 5% of the population
carries, at least 80% of the people carrying aren't criminals.

Carry restrictions don't stop criminals.  Since no social benefit
comes from prohibiting carry by "the rest of us"....

Why should we limit our discussions to Gontier's delusions and exclude
reality?

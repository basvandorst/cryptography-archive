That is, it would affect law-abiding people who just want to use
off-the-shelf black-box GTE KryptoFones.  It would not affect anyone
who has the incentive -- e.g. fear of jail -- to hack together a
system from a few PC's and modems, and some crypto software snarfed
from Finland.

Sure, if the bad guy talks in the clear on a standard phone line,
your third-party listening scheme can nail him.  But we can do that
anyway -- and according to the government's numbers, we only do it a
trivial number of times a year.

ObCrypto: Assuming government good-faith in an eavesdropping
	  protocol is like assuming algorithm secrecy in a
	  cryptographic protocol.

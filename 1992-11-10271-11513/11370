Even non-interest-earning accounts?  Why does the IRS need to know
the balances of accounts that are unrelated to taxations?

Of course, to keep the IRS up-to-date regarding balances, a continuous
stream of information about every deposit and withdrawal must move
from the banks to the state IRS.  Is that proposed also?

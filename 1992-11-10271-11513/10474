       A couple of points:  As far as guns go, registration *has* 
consistently led to confiscation.  There are numerous non-US and US 
examples, not the least of which being New York where it actually happened
and Washington DC where it was threatened.

       The major difference between guns and cars are that licensing and 
registration have not been suggested as a way to reduce the numbers of cars 
in private hands.  This has been said a number of times for guns.

I had the same thought and checked with RSADSI.  The answer is that
PGP has problems other than RSA license and they won't license it.

However, they'll sell you a package of their own called Mailsafe ($50
for network people, I believe) -- or give away the code (and license)
which lets you make a PGP look-alike.  The latter is called RSAREF.

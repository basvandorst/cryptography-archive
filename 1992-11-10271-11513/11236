Subject: various proposals to regulate private encryption
	 technology

Is there an official EFF position on the regulation of private
use of encryption technology? If not, is there one actively
being developed?

The recent posts suggesting that this is not a purely academic
excercise in theology are chilling. It was fun when it didn't
count. If it is real, then a political response must be
prepared and executed. Terry Ritter's hypothetical question
concerning explaining all this technobabble to a judge, jury,
or congressman, is on target. We can not develop a position
after the bills are in commitee on the Hill.

To paraphrase the TV ads: If not now, when? If not the EFF,
who?

followups directed out of sci.crypt. This is a political
issue...

	Good bit of work Hal in formulating an argument in defense of available 
strong cryptography.

	Let me point out the basic flaw not in your reasoning or in the
accurate expectations for public reaction to them but with the whole mess out
courts and LE are in and in the argument given by Terry.

1)The argument for key registration is so we can put away the suspected
  child molester

2)We are unable to convict them because they encrypted some data that we
  suspect is about their crimes.

3)We know that they are guilty because they have done it before (else we must
  apply the innocent till proven clause)

4)We are in this mess bacause when we got them on their prior molestation rap
  they were convicted and served 0.8 year of their 10 year term.

SO WHY BOTHER TO TRY TO CONVICT THEM OF A CYPHER CRIME WHEN WE HAD THEM
ON A HEINOUS CRIME ALLREADY AND LET THEM GO!

At this stage of the game (and I don't promote this) the only lasting solution
would be for the mother and father of that child to take the law into their own
hands and shoot the molester until dead. The courts can't keep them from
reoffending they can't even keep them off the street. (Westly Allan Dodd,
arrests 7 or 8, jail time < 1 year, molestations est >>100, murders 3)
----

I recoginize the reality of the situation and wish it were differient. I
salute those who are working to come up with a counter to those who would use
emotional arguments to create cypher crimes. Sadly our real task is not
addressed, that is putting the REAL criminals away and keeping them there.

when i said `completely viable', i didn't mean that the method was
cryptographically useful.  i just meant that it would work to encrypt
and later decrypt data.  if you didn't know the method, it could
confuse you until you got enough messages to notice that some used
identical `one-time' pads.  if you did know the method, it would be
trivial to decrypt.  getting many chosen plaintext encryptions of
identical plaintext would a very viable attack.

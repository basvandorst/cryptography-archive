Yes.

DES is not a group.  See Keith Cambell and Michael Weiner's paper in the
Crypto 92 proceedings, whenever Springer-Verlag gets around to publishing
them.

Yes.

Encrypting a constant is always dangerous, but both DES and (so far) IDEA
are resistant to that kind of known plaintext attack.  Going with a checksum
just seems safer.

Both are secure.  CBC is more efficient, since you are encrypting data in
64-bit blocks.

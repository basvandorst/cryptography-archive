Of course the world changed with electronic communication.  It's radically
different.

The differences apply to law enforcement, citizen and criminal alike.

The question is about privacy -- not about communication.  Communication
makes neighborhoods bigger and harder to see because physical presence
isn't required to have cooperation.  LE has the same advantage as the
criminal, here.

My question remains:  there was a time when criminals were free to have
private conversations and know that the conversation (or meeting) was
private, assuming one of the participants wasn't a spy.  That time is
returning (or has returned).

Old LE tools should map into the new space (with new connectivity,
as if space warps had been invented).  If you disagree, please cite
some such tools and show how they are defeated.

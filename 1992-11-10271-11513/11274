Given the number of messages here concerning the moral, political, and
ethical issues concerning cryptography there is a clear need for a
another news group dedicated to it.

It is difficult to wade through all the politics to find discussions
dealing with coding, methods, and etc.

There are many groups out there that do not seem as active as the
sub topic of ethics/politics of cryptography.  I apologize for posting
this here -- I didn't know where else to direct this message.

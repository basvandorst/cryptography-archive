Nice try, but there are two problems: in fact, the first F is from a word
in the Declaration of Independence that's adjacent to a word starting with
C, and the out-of-place H is from a word adjacent to an O.  As Hammer has
pointed out, the author of Beale Cipher B2 made 23 such 1-place errors, so
he was certainly trying for ABCDEFGHIIJKLMMNOOPP... so you need to make
sense out of IMOP.

Oddly enough, this was one of Hammer's conjectures: that the author of the
Beale Ciphers has left us a little note telling us that we're on the right
track.  This makes no sense to me -- the way the story goes, he's not
posing a challenge for his cryptanalytical fans, but rather sending a
secret message to a single intended recipient.  But, as Larry Loen
suggests, it's quite possible to get carried away when you're doing this
stuff.  [enter reminiscence mode]  When I was working on a WWI Fuer GOD
cipher I noticed that it was dated right after the battle of Amiens, and
spent days researching the battle, the commanders, the tactics, and the
locations, visualizing the soldiers charging blindly through the morning
mist and all that.  When we finally solved it, it turned out to be a
report of some ship movements out of Tunis.  Go figure.

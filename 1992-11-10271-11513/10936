Indeed, look at the Club of Rome study. Every one of it's conclusions
and predictions have proved wrong. It predicted widespread food shortages
by the late 1980s. Instead fewer people are starving today than any time
in history. It predicted shortages of basic commodities by the late 1980s.
Instead the prices of basic commoditites such as metals and foodstuffs 
have *declined* during the 1980s. The Club of Rome was wrong because it 
took the world to be a zero sum, static game. It neglected technical 
innovation. It neglected resource substitution. It neglected common sense.

Automotive emissions today are 1/10th what they were in 1969 thanks to
technical innovation. The air and the water are *cleaner* today than
they were in 1969. Things environmental are not getting worse as the
doomsters continue to predict in the face of contradictory evidence.
Instead they are continuing to improve. That's due in part to rational
environmental pressure from scientifically literate environmentalists.
And it's due in part to the general trend of technical innovation and
market economics. There continue to be environmental problems, the worst
of which is a tropical extinction crisis due to clearcuting of tropical
rainforests. But things *aren't* getting worse in general, though some
places may be getting worse in *particular* while others are getting
better. The average trend is up, not down. The Club of Rome is wrong.

Change is the natural order of things. Static ecosystems are in general
*dying* ecosystems. The balances continually shift from one equlibrium
point to another. THERE IS NO PREFERRED STATE IN ECOLOGY. Humans are
a vital *part* of the natural world and all their actions as the top
predator on the food and resource pyramid are completely *natural*
actions. There isn't a pristine Golden Age for the environment, and
there never was. The world changes in response to the actions of humans
and other species. Some species win, and some lose. As humans, it's our
task to see that we remain among the winners.

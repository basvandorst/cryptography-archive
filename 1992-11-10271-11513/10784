	This is a fallicy. We have always been able to avoid disclosure of
secret information through hiding that hardcopy. The job of the police has been
to become aware of the existance of such hardcopy and then to find it.

	As for being searched, I think that you would not take it as an
invasion of your privacy but as a gut-renching violation of your person. It's
invasive, dehumanizing and callous. Try riding in a police car as an observer
sometime. Then think of a government out of just control.

	It is not rare. Big criminals alwayse hide the most increminating of
evedence of their crimes. Toss the gun in the river or what have you. To
portray crypto as something new is false.

	Missing the point? The point is that the ends no matter how noble
do not justify the means.

	The good of true security in communications far outweigh the bad uses
of secure communication.

	If we inact a law to abridge personal privacy now, where will we be in
10 years (20,30,50) when that law is no longer needed because RSA falls to the
PC of the time. It will be that the erosion of our liberty was the net result.

	The job of crypto is to make the disclosure of plaintext so expensive
as to make disclosure unlikely. I think the governments time would be better
spent not in creating and attempting to enforce new laws that wont work but in
finding out how to break RSA et al when the proper existing points of law allow
it.

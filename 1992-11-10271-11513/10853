	No, I'm interested in a band-aid that addresses the problem.
Medicine does this (it cures a disease that could cause death).  Waiting
periods and bans only serve to take firearms out of the hands of
law-abiding.  The criminal can still get the firearms he/she wants on
the black market.  No waiting.  No background checks. No limitation on
his choice of weapon.  Stiffer penalties and more prisons get the
criminals off the streets.  This is a proven, working solution that
can be used as a band-aid until a better solution can be found.

	Action simply for the sake of doing something is often more
dangerous than not doing anything at all.

	Correct.  Which is why we need more prisons and stiffer penalties.

	Stealing is yet another crime punishable by a prison sentence.
Considering the price of some of the firearms out there, this could be
grand larceny, but I digress.

	So the theory is: If you take guns out of the hands of law-abiding
citizens, we'll take them out of the hands of the criminals?  Wrong.
I'll also digress on the authority of society to control an individual
to concentrate on the more concrete answer: the black market.  Guns are
not only stolen from the law-abiding, they are smuggled into the country,
as well.  If, as you suggest, we take the guns out of the hands of the
citizen so that stolen guns are not the problem, where do you think
they'll turn to?

	So now you say "Eliminate the black market."  Some may argue
that this is an impossible task, but let's say we can achieve this
goal.  Have you ever heard of a zip gun?  A couple of pieces of pipe
at the local hardware store can make a fairly effective firearm at
close range.  Do you want to ban lengths of pipe now?

	You also seem to ignore the fact that less than 25% of all
violent crime are committed with firearms.  Obviously, this means
there are other methods of committing violent acts than with firearms.
How do you propose to handle that?

	I don't doubt you intentions.  I believe we have the same
ultimate goal in mind (the reduction of violent crime in the US.)
Where we differ is on how to achieve this goal.  You want to eliminate
the tools.  I want to attack violent crime directly.

	That is you opinion, which you have a right to voice.  However,
you do *not* have the right to compell others to follow your thinking
if they disagree with you.

	According to you comment, obviously the total number of guns used
in violent crime is < 12000, thus the ratio of the total number of firearms
to the total number used in violent crimes is negligible ( I get a number
less than 6*10^-5.)  Now, how many of these were legally owned firearms?
My guess is the number is smaller still.  So what's your point?

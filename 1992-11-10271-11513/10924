Due to the overwhelming number of requests for the three research reports
on the P=NP matter we have decided that the best plan will be to post them.

They will be posted in the newsgroup comp.theory this evening in postscript
format. Assuming all goes well, this should allow everyone who requested
copies to have them by Tuesday.

Despite the large number of e-mail messages received by Prof. Swart, he
will do his best to reply to as many of you as time permits.

Prof. Swart thanks everyone for all their encouragement.

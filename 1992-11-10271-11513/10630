Let file_n considered as q_n(x), with checksum the residual r_n(x),
where for all n: q_n(x) mod p(x) = r_n(x), p the checksum generating
polynomial used.

Then for all n: p divides q_n - r_n.  So p divides GCD_{i=1}^{n} q_i - r_i.
 In particular, with high probability p = GCD_{i=1}^{n} q_i - r_i
(assuming random q's).

This shows that Karp-Rabin fingerprints can not be used to check
integrity when the privacy of the fingerprints (as well as the
irreducible[s] used) can not be guaranteed.

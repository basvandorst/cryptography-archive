I am sure this is an FAQ, so E-mail responses might be appropriate.

What is the status of the Beale ciphers and attempts to crack it?
Have NSA people dropped a few Cray-years on it with the Library of
Congress as the source of potential keys? 

Is the historical record clear on whether T.J. Beale ever actually
existed, whether he went on a mining expedition, etc.?
Is a list of the names of the people in Beale's expedition available?

Is it all a hoax?

Anyway, stuff which would be helpful is appreciated.  I already have the
FAQ from rec.games, which gives the ciphers and a decryption of Beale 2.
I have sent away to the Beale Association for a couple of their pamphlets.

It sounds like fun, but I don't expect to crack it easily.  It's going
to take DAYS :-).

I don't understand your examples.  Are they supposed to argue for the
universal registration of all keys and encryption methods?  In some
examples you give, it seems subpoenaing the key would suffice and would
be consistent with current law.  In the S&L case (and for other
regulated businesses) simply regulate that records the government may
oversee not be encrypted, or that those keys must be registered, or
subpoena the keys when necessary.

Why paint with a broad brush when narrowly tailored and/or already
existing law will accomplish the same ends with less controversy and
preserve greater liberty?

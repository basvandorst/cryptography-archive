Well, I've had a closer look --

        AMENDMENT I
        Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment
        of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof;
        or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press;  [etc.]
                         ^^^^^^^ ^^ ^^^^^^
-- and it's perfectly clear that what they _meant_ was your freedom
to make a speech, e.g., when trying to get elected to public office.
There's nothing in there about other modes of communication, and
_certainly_ nothing about keeping secrets from the Government!  BTW,
the Amendment only limits Congress.  Individual states may further
limit your means of running for public office, and many of them do.

Hey, guy, those of us that are "environmentalists" are that way from
necessity, not choice.  Take a look at the Club of Rome study or other
similar studies of population growth and decline and figure out for
yourself what happens to a species that overpopulates it's environment,
be it a puddle, a pond or a planet. They either exhaust their resources,
die of disease, or choke to death on their own crap.  Perhaps humans
have to option to make some intelligent collective decisions regarding
these matters, perhaps not.  The problems won't go away on their own.
Just talk to anyone who's lived in LA or Denver during summer smog
alerts, or who lives and works in areas where groundwater is
contaminated with ag chemicals or other polution, or folks who used to
make their livings fishing on the Medeterranean, which is now nearly a
dead ocean from a fisherman's point of view.  Fresh air, water and the
like are the responsibility of the people to protect, whether or not you
like specific regulations imposed by federal, state or local
governments.  Your attitude doesn't help at all.

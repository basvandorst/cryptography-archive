Huh?  Accumulating 'things' is reason for a search??

Subtle difference in those last two sentences - yes, information can
be HELD in things, but the information itself is NOT a THING.
		Storage != data != information.
      a 'thing' ^^^^^^^    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ these are not 'things'

	least until your society condones torture,

Yup, best damn way in the world of storing information; massive
capacity, built-in redundancy, associative lookup, *and* totally
immune to decryption (so far).

I certainly hope it doesn't!  But even if it does, it still doesn't
allow anyone to force disclosure of my *personal* encoding scheme,
which is stored *in my brain* (nowhere else).  The government may
be entitled to look through all my files, but that doesn't mean
they'll be able to understand them!

Of course, they would *believe* they understood them; they're not
even PGP-encrypted.  But the 'plain-text' doesn't necessarily
mean what they think it does!

For example, I have on my system at home (note: it's not on the
net - sorry, any potential crackers out there) a list of all my
credit cards, with the matching PIN numbers - but encoded by a
personal algorithm.  Even if someone were to steal my cards and
a printout of this file together, it wouldn't be the slightest
bit of use to them; they would have just as good a chance of
getting the correct PINs by using random numbers.  There are
an *infinite* number of algorithms which will map one 4-digit
number to another, and they would have no clue as to which one
I've chosen.

You ain't kidding!
Imagine this:
	I register my encryption key, as required.
	Some government agency decides to tap my communications,
	and sees a whole string of innocuous-looking messages,
	encrypted with my registered key.  But my accomplice
	decodes those same 'innocuous' messages using *our private
	protocol* to obtain the secret information (and she does
	it in her head, so there is no record).  What 'evidence'
	can the government agency present?  You cannot even
	prove that *this post* has (OR doesn't have) a hidden
	message of this type embedded within it.

Nor are they effective against people who wish to conceal information!

Go ahead, my books are open; but they have *meaning* only to me.

They would probably prefer a brain-probe, cos that's the only
*effective* means of extracting information from someone who
doesn't want to disclose it ;-}

 Well, if that's the case, then that's the case! :-(  I just thought 
 they might be thrilled at the opportunity.  I know I would've been.

 Eh, sure, of course they would.  But we can do the speed tests 
 ourselves and search the patents also. We only wanted to know whether
 anyone here could decrypt our test file.
 
 Data encryption is not a theoretical exercise.  If the purpose of 
 cryptoanalysis had been limited to pontificating on known algorithms,
 life would be sweet and simple, wouldn't it?

 Oh yes, there is!  Gosh, we even have a FAQ post and everything...
 We have people who support each other against newcomers.  There is a
 remarkable solidarity among the "in" crowd.  FAQ + solidarity 
 creates a definite "here" place.  Don't you think?  ;-)

 Really? I'll take your word for it, although I've been reading 
 this newsgroup for a while and have not seen a large number of 
 such challenges.

 We certainly don't want to do that. The output is the challenge,
 not the algorithm.

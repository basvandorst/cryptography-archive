     I am a senior in a Software Engineering class at the University of
  Wisconsin-Milwaukee.  My software project is to write a MS Windows
  based program which demonstrates a DES Pseudo Random Number Generator.
     What I am in need of is a person who know DES encryption very well,
  who I can do correspondence with over the next 4 week or so.  
     I have the Denning Book "Cryptography and Data Security", but since 
  I have no cryptography background the book leaves me with MANY questions.

     If you know DES and would like to help a me out, not with the C 
  coding or windows coding, only understanding how DES works please
  send me a message.

     Thanks

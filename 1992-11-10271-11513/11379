Erik,

Ex cathedra you say.  Canon we say and canon for a long time.  You just
don't want to hear that.  I sincerely suggest that you exit stage left
with your macho nonesense until you have successfully protected your
algorithm with a patent filing and are willing to make it known.  Then
and only then will people who care about, know about and think about
crypto be interested in your challenge.  The point is so simple I don't
see why you fail to see it.  The ciphertext may well resist attack
without knowing the algorithm but be trivially broken knowing it and
no system with that property is considered secure by anyone in or
peripheral to the field.  Please come back when you are protected and
are willing to follow the rules by disclosing the algorithm.  Until
then, enough already!

Later,

Bob

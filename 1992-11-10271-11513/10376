Who killed or shot at these people?  In the case of JFK, there seems to be
quite a bit of CIA involvement.  I think the CIA will be able to obtain
weapons any time it wants.  If you wish to say the CIA was not involved, then
some other organization must surely have been.  Otherwise how would you
explain the multiple entry angles from two or more shooting locations.
An organization powerful enough to shoot and kill a president should also
be able to obtain weapons without to much trouble.  Restricting guns from
people like ourselves whould have had no effect on this shooting.

In the case of Reagan, didn't this guy shoot the president because he had
a thing for Jody Foster and he thought the president had insulted her? 
Wouldn't you say this guy was just a little nuts?  By the way, didn't you
see all the Treasury guys standing around with Uzis?  Do you think they
don't make mistakes?  

I don't have much of a chance against guys with Uzis
but I don't have any chance without a gun.  If you want to do away with
guns then remove them from the entire world and I'll get rid of mine.

As far as who decides when it is absolutely necessay, WE THE PEOPLE should
decide and should be responsible for our actions.  This is a dangerous
world and as grown-ups we will make decisions that will affect other 
peoples lives.  If you wish that all decisions should be made for you I
know several places in the world where the government will provide that
service for you.

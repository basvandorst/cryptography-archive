It's a "technical term."  The police abbreviate it to "LAC."  It 
differentiates American citizens who are minding our own business,
exercising our own rights, and not hurting anybody else, from criminals.

It creeps into these discussions because gun owners tend to believe that
there is no reason to prevent a law-abiding adult from owning an arm.
As opposed, obviously, to a criminal, who has surrendered that right by 
his actions, or whose rights the government is allowed to suppress because
of his crime (however you want to look at it).

Oh.  Is that all you're talking about?  Then read on.

  Number of children under 5 who drown in swimming pools per year: 380+

  Number of children under five who die in residential fires caused by
  adults who fall asleep while smoking, per year: 432

  Number of children under 5 killed in gun accidents during 1984: 34 [Center for
  Disease Control]

  Number of children under 15 killed by handgun accidents per year: 50 to 55

  All data from the National Safety Council, except as noted.

So you want to ban a country's worth of guns, leaving a lot of otherwise
innocent people defenseless, for roughly one kid per state?

No, sorry.  It hides the problem, it makes you think you're solving
the problem.  But the real problem -- violent crime -- is a sucking 
chest wound which tends to bleed through, and then there you are with 
that ugly, visible problem again.

Here's some free advice.  If you ever need a vasectomy, try not to
let the doctor get away with just using a tight rubber band.

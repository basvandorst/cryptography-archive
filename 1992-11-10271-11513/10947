I'd like to learn more about digital encryption, but I really don't know where
to start.  While the people who discuss digital encryption (DES,DVP,etc.) are
obviously quite knowledgeable (from sci.crypt), I can't follow the
conversation with only basic understanding of the subject.  What books,
peroidicals, etc, could I access to get a start?

Somebody about 2 weeks ago, posted an "unofficial FAQ".  I found quite helpful
and easy to understand.  I'm looking for something similiar to this level.

I have access to an university library and a public library system.

Thanks!

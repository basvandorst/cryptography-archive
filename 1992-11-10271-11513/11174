There has been a slight delay in converting the research reports to postscript.
Also, it turns out that one of the files is too large to be posted here,
even in compressed format. We are busy arranging an anonymous FTP account
where all three postscript files will be located. Everything should be set
by tomorrow afternoon, at which time we will post the FTP site.

Thank you for your patience.

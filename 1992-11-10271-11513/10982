A friend of mine resently sent me the following message:

   NCPUCNNYHCSD
   FSNCYFMYSNTN
   OSTAKOYNHWFK
   QMHWMUNSHQKQ
   EFBADNKMDUYD
   NCSFGRTQFKRE
   BYNSDXRHDSSD
   EFZTFZNYBANT
   NSAMSNCUFZMK
   FLJTDXHQSDYS
   KRNSFDAISVSB
   TIONJKPSFYNS

Despite numerous hours of work on the probleme, I was not able
de decypher it (I am not an expert, or even an amateur, at this
sort of thing).  I would appreciate if anyone could decypher this
message and explain to me how I could decypher any other message
coded the same way (don't worry, this is only for fun).
Warning:  the decrypted message may be in English but it MAY
ALSO be in French.


Please e-mail answer to dionc@ireq.hydro.qc.ca

Thank you.

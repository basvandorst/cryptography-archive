Your copper balloon won't float any better than your lead one would.

THIS IS UNENFORCABLE!  It's a neat idea but it won't matter a HILL OF
BEANS! 

If I were J. Random Mafioso, I would:

1. Get laptop PCs, modems, and an DES cypher program.  (John Gotti
   himself could write one in LISP given the books and enough time --
   he's not stupid.  Or he could hire someone.)

2. Exchange keys when I meet the guy I want to talk to.  I have
   to meet him to see if I trust him anyway.  (This is when I show him
   the big nasty bruisers who'll make him into salami if he crosses me).

3. Use REGULAR TELEPHONE SERVICE to transmit undecryptable messages.
   I can run around to payphones, use accoustic couplers, whenever I
   want!  Are you going to bust me for having a laptop and a modem?

I have $5000 -- enough to buy the equipment so I don't need to.  I
don't wanna participate in your silly protocol because I don't want
you to be able to tap me.

Are you going to make it a crime for me to use my modem?

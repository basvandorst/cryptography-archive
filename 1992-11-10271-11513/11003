Vesselin Bontchev is incorrect about RSAREF running only on PCs. In the
ripem versions under beta test, which use RSAREF, there is a Mac and
a Unix version as well as a PC version.

He is also mistaken about the interface. ripem, which uses rsaref, has
the same kind of command line interface that PGP does.

Carl Ellison, in discussing weak systems which can be broken by the NSA
but not Joe Mobster, misses the point.

Many of us are worried not about Joe Mobster, but about Mitsubishi,
or the Government of France, or a Russian competitor with friends in
their equivalent of the NSA. Thus cryptosystems used by Americans in
international business need to be robust against other well-endowed
and technically skilled organizations, not the NSA.

I, too, trust the NSA, but they're not the threat to many of us.

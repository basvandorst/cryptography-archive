Imagine if someone developed "multiple content cryptographic files" which could
contain an arbitrary number of different messages depending on what decryption
key were used.  In order for this to work to protect privacy against supoenaed
keys, there would have to be a large cyphertext:plaintext ratio to make it 
nearly impossible to deduce the number of plaintext messages contained therein.
It would thus be impossible for big brother to ever know if you were truthfully
answering the question "have you given us ALL the keys"...maybe they'd have to 
torture you for a few hours to make sure.

[ a trivial example of such a system is a file which is the xor of the plaintext
with a random key.  By xoring the cypertext with an alternate plaintext, you
have an alternate "key" which would yield the innocous plaintext message rather
than the encrypted one.  In fact, for this simple "xor" cypher, there is a key
which will generate any message of appropriate length! ]

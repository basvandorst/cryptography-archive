The first discussions of the subject talked about building up
a large set of matched plain and cipher pairs and once a critical 
mass was achieved (2^47) a key would emerge.  At Crypto 92 Biham
presented a paper that, among other things, showed that this 
attack could be converted into a probabilistic attack that had
a small chance of succeeding each time it was applied.  The result
is that even if you change your key very often it is likely that 
one key will be recovered every 2^47 ciphertexts.  Keep in mind
that you have no way of knowing which of many keys will be recovered
and you would only get the plaintext encrypted with that key.

As I look back at that last paragraph, I can see my description is
rather sloppy - but I hope you get the basic idea.  If you want
to get the whole story read Biham's paper in the Crypto 92 proceedings.

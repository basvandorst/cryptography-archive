Bureaucracy thrives on fools errands.  What better occupation than
fighting crime, poverty, ignorance, and sin?  If one is permitted to
define what they are, then one is guaranteed a living.  If one is
in danger of succeeding, one can simply raise the bar.

If one makes one's living by reading other people's mail and one is in a
position to outlaw strong envelopes, then one is in a no loose position.

	However, all of the things you mention above are illegal.
The last I knew, target practice was not.  Please state an example
of something that is legal to do, that you do not do, and still feel
your right to participate in such activity should be banned.

	Actually, yes it would hurt.  It would keep the law-abiding
citizen from participating in a very satisfying form of recreation.
Since there is no evidence to support the claim that a ban would work, 
there is no reason to support such a ban.

	Why can't we address the underlying problems?  What's keeping
us from doing so?  "Patching the system" simply adds kludge on top of
kludge until you have a system that is so huge noone can understand it
and noone can support it.  If that's the case, it's time for a new system.

	If you realize a handgun ban doesn't address the problem, then
for what reason do you support a handgun ban?  If it doesn't solve the
the problem, what purpose does it serve?

	If you really want to solve the problem, try studying the problem
and comming up with real solutions instead of supporting a band-aid that 
will only effect law-abiding citizens like you or me.  The information
is out there. All you have to do is look it up.

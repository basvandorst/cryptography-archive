Sorry about the break, but the message editor here does not seem
to allow more than 100 lines per message...
   
Anyway, to complete my post, here's the most interesting part:
   
================continues from previous message=========
 
 Apart from the intellectual challenge, the author of NuCrypt says 
 he's offering a fine evening in New York City to anyone capable of 
 decrypting the secret words.  Should you win, you'll have to get to 
 NYC yourself to collect but, once there, there should be no expenses 
 for you well into the wee hours... sounds like an easy big dinner
 to me...
  
 Any takers?

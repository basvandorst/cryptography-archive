        I think it was asked where we could get the address of USA government
persons for letter writing and the like. Below I've included the names of the
elected officers. I don't have the address for the senate and congress but I'm
sure someone on the net does and will post it. In any case the list includes a
telephone number so that you may call and ask for an address.

Also included is a list of committees that the respective person is on. Try a
grep of intellengence for example...
  
Hopes this helps in your letter writing efforts to express your views (both USA
and others country persons should have input).

Regards, Ethan

P.S. It would be helpful if anyone who writes a letter to congress post that
letter here as a template for others.

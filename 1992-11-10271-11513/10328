Smiley to the second responder (:-).

Now, I'm really curious, why Ms. Denning suddently becomes concerned 
with what she calls "a major crisis in law enforcement".  Since when 
did  inability of law enforcement  to eavesdrop on anybody's private 
communications at their whim, become a "crisis"?

Now - what is really needed for the law enforcement? To be able to
intercept communications OF A SUSPECT,  WHEN AND ONLY WHEN SUCH
INTERCEPTIONS ARE AUTHORIZED BY THE COURT FOR THAT PARTICULAR
CASE. And you don't have to be Einstein, or Mr. E. Hoover to
guess what normally is being done is such a case:

Experienced guys  from FBI go to that person's house,  and BUG his 
living premises! Maybe even search his papers, and maybe even make 
a dump of his hard drives...In more serious cases and hoping those 
premises aren't TEMPEST-qualified, EME can be picked up,if there's 
enough reason... 

How come this still-practiced method is suddently discarded? 
Eavesdropping on person-per-person basis isn't enough any
more? Why?

Can having to  actually bother with getting the court warrant, and 
then  bother  to send men to a particular place,  and having to do 
that for each "suspect" personally, instead of just keying in some 
code words to your computer  to pick up anything on anybody, be 
called "a major crisis in law enforcement"?!   Well, if yes - 
it's not the law they are officially supposed to enforce!

If the "law enforcement" actually would like to be able to do
routine "surveillance" on the whole populations, picking at
random whoever they want, just to take a look - MAYBE
there's something illegal going on -  only in this 
case "unregistered keys" can be an obstacle...


Ms. Denning,  how comes you aren't aware of that simple 
method of intercepting commmunications?   Or are you in
favor of "surveillance" on much larger scale? Something
nationwide, rather than on case-to-case basis?

Uri.

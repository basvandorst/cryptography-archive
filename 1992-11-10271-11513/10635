Of course this adds little information - fear, uncertainty and doubt
are good tools to use.  Besides, a long-used technique is to just
"imply" that some acts (like this) are expected from the employee but
if the employee gets in trouble because of this that's his own problem
and the organization denies all responsibility.  Anything needn't even
be said.

Yes.  And if someone thinks the RSA patent would have gotten through
without a patent secrecy order if the patent had been applied before
publication, I have a nice second-hand bridge to sell, in very good
condition.

Followups directed to alt.conspiracy, as many readers think this is a
group for cryptography, not politics of governments or freedom.

here we have another basic problem with registration: there is nothing
wrong with the products themselves, just the abuses. regulating products
is easier, but it doesn't solve any problems. regulating use solves
problems, but it's very difficult to enforce. the costs of either
method greatly outweigh the benefits. of the two, the former has the most
potential for violating personal privacy.

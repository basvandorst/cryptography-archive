Arthur L. Rubin states that Ron Rivest can ask for keys as a licensing
requirement for his patented systems.

I think not. This would be found to be an unreasonable licensing
requirement, I'm sure, by the courts. Since Rivest has no physical
control over the use of his patents (since the techniques have been
published world-wide), he cannot enforce such a provision if it's
found unreasonable.

To see just how unreasonable, just imagine the manufacturer of a
patented safe requiring users to register their combinations.

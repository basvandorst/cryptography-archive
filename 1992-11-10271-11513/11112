I've seen a lot of discussion here about Unpredictable Random Number
Generators as apposed to statistically reliable random number generators
and I am interested in seeing a URNG.  Could someone post (or e-mail)
a formula/code/algorithm/description of an Unpredictable RNG?  I'm not
asking for all of the above, one would be all I need.

Thanks in advance.

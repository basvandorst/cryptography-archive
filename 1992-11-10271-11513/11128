Well, I hope this isn't too testosterone-driven, but as an activist
and a person who knows he and his wife are under surveillance - phone
tapped; mail being opened; I am nothing but thankful for Mr. Zimmerman's
efforts.  Well intentions aside, nobody has a right to read my email.

I hope they jail the child molestor but I'm sick of being deprived the
rights which my great-great-great-great-great grandparents fought for.
As a grandchild of John Adams and a son of the American Revolution 
I feel nauseous at the way that my communications have been treated by
the Bush/Reagan administration and am continuing my activities with the
help of PGP 2.0.

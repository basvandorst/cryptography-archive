If one perturbs the definition of primality slightly while retaining
its basic statistical characteristics (mean, variance) then one can
actually prove such theorems as "There are infinitely many twin primes"
and "Every even number > 3 is the sum of two primes" (Goldbach's
conjecture) without much difficulty.  (I believe "lucky" numbers
provide an instance of this general principle.)  In these proofs the
statistical evidence is overwhelming, encouraging one to assign
extraordinary odds to the failure of Goldbach's conjecture.

(I will with no misgivings bet you ten thousand dollars at a thousand
to one odds that no counterexample to Goldbach's conjecture will appear
in the next ten years.  If one is found I owe you ten thousand dollars,
otherwise you owe me ten dollars.  Anyone who's played for a while with
Goldbach's conjecture will see that this is very easy money for me.)

There is *no* comparable statistical evidence for either P=NP or
P!=NP.  The evidence to date for P!=NP is that a lot of people have
looked for a fast algorithm for the generic NP problem and failed.  If
you ask me what evidence there is to date for P=NP I will reply that an
even larger set of people have looked for a proof of P!=NP and failed.
If we judge these arguments only by the extent of the search in each
case, an otherwise disinterested bettor would say that the a priori
evidence that P=NP is *overwhelming*.

Moshe Vardi has made P=NP his odds-on favorite, I admit I'm a
conservative old coward in sticking to even odds.

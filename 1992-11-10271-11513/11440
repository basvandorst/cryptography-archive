Please see my post in sci.crypt (Message-ID:<By2v5F.DCM.2@cs.cmu.edu>, 
Date: Sat, 21 Nov 1992 17:56:03 GMT) for a proof of how if P=NP you
can build a machine that recognizes an NP Complete language (halts
accepting on instances in the language, doesn't accept instances not
in the language- but may not halt as in Garey&Johnson "Computers and
Intractability: A guide to the Theory of NP-Completeness" 1979 pp.
24-25).  With only a proof that P=NP (you do not need to know the
index of any machine that solves NP complete problems in poly time or
even what the polynomial bounding some such machine is).

Of course this machine is SLOW, and you still have no idea how long it
is going to take (only that it is less than some, unknown,
polynomial).

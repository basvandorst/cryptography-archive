seems to me that these "balloons" on key registration all have one
fatal flaw: they violate the KISS principle. in a big way.

it is not practical, nor will it be effective without draconian
measures. encryption is essentially a very simple process. if i
were in a mood to be humorous i'd say that's probably what the
government fears the most. it's not beaurocratic enough. there
is no paper to be shredded. no wires to plug into. it's people
doing for themselves, without any kind of reliance on authority.

registration of any kind destroys that simple utility. suddenly
we have tons of "paperwork", more laws, more penalties, more
money flowing into the government, more possibility for abuse and 
more time for all involved. of course, those it was -supposed- to 
effect simply continue use basic principles of encryption that 
somehow fail to disappear just 'cause the powers that be are 
uncomfortable with them.

regulating encryption is as silly as regulating certain classes
of mathematical transformations. come to think of it, that's
-exactly- what it is.

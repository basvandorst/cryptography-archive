That's not quite right.  It's not that Canada recognizes US patents.
That would mean the owner of a US patent could show up in a Canadian 
court asking that someone doing something in Canada be stopped and made
to hand over money.  That does not happen.

No, if you show up in a Canadian court you had better be holding a 
Canadian patent.

Perhaps the commenter means that if you apply for a Canadian patent, it
may help that the US patent office was willing to give you a patent on 
the same thing.  Yes, it may help but you can't count on it.

Australia and Israel do have programs which (oversimplified) amount
to "if it's good enough for the US patent office it's good enough for us".

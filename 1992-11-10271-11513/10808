  I have heard this arguement many times before, but haven't seen any
  sources or data to back it up! Does ANYONE have data to correlate the
  crime rates to gun-control legistation in any (or all) of the cities/
  states in the country? I need this for a speech on Monday (11-12-92),
  so an e-mail response would be best.

  Thanks

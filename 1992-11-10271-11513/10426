Exactly. This subject belongs on sci.crypt as much as any other topic
seen for years, and a whole more so than endless rehashes of what DES
is and the like. (Of course, two years from now people will be
complaining about the endless rehashes of the key registration issue!
:-} )

And readers of this group apparently agree. Of the more than 300 or so
messages in this thread, in half a dozen Usenet groups, most came from
sci.crypt (this can be seen by looking at the discussion in the other
groups, such as comp.org.eff.talk., alt.privacy, etc.). If the readers
of sci.crypt find little interest in this thread, it will die the
normal death of uninteresting threads.

These key registration ideas are crypto protocols with a vengeance!

Again, we should all thank Prof. Denning for raising this extremely
interesting and debate-provoking idea. Whether we like the idea or
not, it has raised important issues.

Much as I hate being locked out, let's remember that the patent system
is *intended* to give inventors a time limited monopoly.  PKP did a
damn fine job in utilizing the system to obtain sole rights to the
patents such that so far no one has been able to get around their
set of claims.  While I hate it, I congratulate them on a job well done.

The only thing that really sticks in my craw is the fact that all the
work was funded by taxpayers.  This is a fundamental flaw in the system
and we should be working to change that.  Any country's citizen should
have unlimited rights to use any patent resulting from its government's
funded work!  That could still be made law and should be.

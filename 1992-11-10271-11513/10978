  A paper diary has the advantage that it is possible to prove that the
suspect actualy had it in his possesion.  Unless he wore gloves, a hair
net, and face mask when he wrote it there will be some kind of physical
evidence to support the view that he wrote it.  There is no equivalent
way of prooving who an electronic file was created by, and when.  Even
if the file wasn't created by police, it may have been created by 
someone other than the suspect.

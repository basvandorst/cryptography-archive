Well, if I had the time and interest to break your encryption scheme, what I
would do is a chosen ciphertext attack.  That is, I would run the ciphertext
through your decoding program and look at the output text.  Then I would
change a byte in the ciphertext and see how the decoded text changes.  I would
keep doing this to see how much I can figure out about the decoding method.
Does changing a byte in the ciphertext change one byte or a few bytes in the
output, or does it change the whole output?  Can I figure out if some bytes
are the key and some bytes are the data?  Can I figure out how big the key is?
Does the output change in a simple way based on the input change, e.g.
arithmetically or logically?

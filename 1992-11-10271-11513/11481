I'd put a vote in for
"Cutting your own throat to avoid being mugged."

It requires somewhat less contextual information to decrypt :-) than
the village metaphor, since more people are familiar with street crime
than are familiar with war-time (I mean police-action-time) bombings.

Plus, the metaphor is much more relevant to the issue at hand; the
guy that mugs you is probably seeking money to buy drugs.  And that's
what we'd be "cutting our throats" to try to stop.

Extremely apt.

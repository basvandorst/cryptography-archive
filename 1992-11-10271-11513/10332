I had FTP'd PGP20 executables and source from the german ftp site just a 
little bit ago.  I never got to look at it.  I had a major system crash,
and in the process lost several files, including files I had FTP'd, which
included these two files.

My only FTP source is long distance from me and I can't afford to call it
again to FTP these two files.  I also lost my mailbox, and so lost the 
FTP site name/number and directory/filename...

If someone would be willing to uuencode these two files and mail them
to me I would appreciate it.  Please check with me first, so we can 
make sure we have a good mail path.

If not, could someone tell me the FTP site, exact directory and file
names?  That way I can try to FTPmail it (I have the FTPmail help
file, but not the address...could you tell me tht also?)

Thanks for your help in advance..

Greg

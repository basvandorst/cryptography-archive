While I don't argue that such a sampling/compression/encryption/
transmission/decryption/decompression/reconstruction could be done virtually
in real time on a typical phone line with a lot of funding, I will need
some math and some specifications for devices capable of carrying this out
reliably on an analog cellular network before I am convinced.  I don't have
bandwidth specs or s/n values for cellular transmissions, so I can't do this
for myself.

As for scramblers, I'd like to point out that digital scrambling of phone
lines (not subscriber lines generally) predates the DES.

In response to a comment that the Feds have the right to regulate
communications, Jyrki quotes the first amendment back at me.

But it depends on interpretation. Regulating channels is not the
same as regulating speech. A strict constructionist would say
that one can say what one likes into the air via one's unaided
voice. But as soon as technical means intervene (such as the use of
a megaphone in a public park, or the use of e-mail) the government
has the right to regulate those means. One is still free to talk,
and thus the protection isn't violated.

By the way, even strict construction has limits, as in the Supreme
Court decision that the right to free speech does not extend to
falsely crying "Fire!" in a crowded theater.

The paragraph bellow is extracted from the PGP2.0 documentation:


     There is a company called AccessData (87 East 600 South, Orem, Utah
     84058, phone 1-800-658-5199) that sells a package for $185 that
     cracks the built-in encryption schemes used by WordPerfect, Lotus
     1-2-3, MS Excel, Symphony, Quattro Pro, Paradox, and MS Word 2.0.  It
     doesn't simply guess passwords-- it does real cryptanalysis.  Some
     people buy it when they forget their password for their own files. 
     Law enforcement agencies buy it too, so they can read files they
     seize.  I talked to Eric Thompson, the author, and he said his
     program only takes a split second to crack them, but he put in some
     delay loops to slow it down so it doesn't look so easy to the
     customer.  He also told me that the password encryption feature of
     PKZIP files can be easily broken, and that his law enforcement
     customers already have that service regularly provided to them from
     another vendor.


In these conditions I think the contest launched by PKWARE is of no interest.

 Oh, my goodness! Did someone bite? Do we have a taker? Are you 
 going to actually try to discover those hidden words, or will 
 you make a shameful about-face after having exposed yourself thus?

 No, he doesn't sound like you at all.

 It's not, but I didn't say that. I said: "As usual, the ciphertext 
 has a more or less random appearance and is pretty much 
 incompressible by archiving utilities."  What's wrong with that?
 It's the truth. If you can't use it, just discard it, no need to go 
 around parading your (mistaken) qualification of it.

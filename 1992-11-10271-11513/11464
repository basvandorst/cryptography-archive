As best I can tell, it is not.  In fact, I'd be very interested if anyone
could provide me with a patent number to show otherwise.  However...
ElGamal's system is so closely linked to Diffie-Hellman that one could
make a strong case that using it would infringe the DH patent.  In
fact, this is one of the controversies surrounding the NIST Digital
Signature System.  (Another, of course, is Schnorr's patent.)

	Bravo!!!  Thank you so much for saying it like it is!

	Exactly!!

	Yes.  And the net.quislings are ready to be their handmaidens.

	Thank you so much for saying this.  Maybe sacrifices for freedom are
	NOT just for pretty speeches on Veterans Day after all.  You don't 
	know how happy it makes me to hear you say this.  In the future very 
	little blood will be shed by freedom lovers but sacrifice will still be
	necessary.  It makes me very happy to see that there still are
	folks here that know that and believe in freedom.

	Right on Larry.  You can't imagine how glad I am to see others
	take Terry to task for selling freedom short.

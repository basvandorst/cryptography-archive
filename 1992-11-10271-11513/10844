 Any such distinction is illusory; there is no information without
 a "thing" to hold it.  The point of this is that while The
 Constitution does prevent a court from demanding the information
 stored by the things in your mind, it also recognizes the "right"
 of the government to anything *not* in your mind.

 Some posters believe that this may apply to cryptography *now*.
 That is, it may be within the power of a court to order a defendant
 to deliver *plaintext* for seized ciphertext.  Of course, the
 "only" penalty that I can see for opposing such an order would be
 contempt of court.  As this is unlikely to be very productive, a
 future government might want to make the penalty considerably more
 interesting, or eliminate any current ambiguity in the "right" to
 make such a demand.

 Not now.  But future legislation could restrict the right to use
 cryptography to those who are willing to accept the possible audit
 of their ciphered information under due process.

 I guess the thing I find most irritating about this post is the
 attitude that somehow *you* get to decide what rules you will obey,
 or what you will *allow* government to do.  This seems strangely
 unlike the "rule of law" under which I must operate.

 I'm really too old to be impressed by a swaggering attitude about
 what you will or will not permit government to do.  If such a law
 passes, you will comply or go to jail.  You can have a good swagger
 there.


 The original reason for this thread was to prepare for a
 legislative contest by finding the best arguments against the
 unhindered use of cryptography, and then trying to defeat them.
 Apparently, we must first teach the rule of law and the concept
 that legislation can prevent one from doing things which one
 wants to do.  It sounds a little like teaching maturity.

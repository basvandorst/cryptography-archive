I'm afraid not: The right to use technological means to project one's
voice is, accourding the Surpeme Court ruling, protected. However,
this right ends, when it infringes other people's rights (thence
the regulation of megaphones in public parks), further you have no
right not to be _overheard_: If you broadcast your conversations,
the government needs no warrent to listen it.

Agreed.  The analog noise source must first be verified before hooking
it to the digital noise source.  One thing to verify is that the
high-frequency cutoff (whether due to an explicit filter or due to
bandwidth limit of your op-amp) is much higher than the frequency at
which you will sample the noise source.  Another thing to verify is
that the frequency spectrum of the noise output doesn't contain any
suspicious peaks, especially at frequencies related to the frequency
at which you will sample the noise source.

Alain succinctly satirizes the arguments for crypto control by those
supporting it as:

"In order to prevent the rape of our virgins, we should fuck them first."

This has the virtue of being brief and to the point, but will likely
offend some we wish to persuade.

Can anyone come up with an equally pithy and short summary suitable for
a "family audience"?

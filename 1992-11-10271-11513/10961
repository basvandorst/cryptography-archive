Two diverse points here:

1. I am in the process of drawing up a will.  Throughout the entire process
   I have been thinking:  Gee, wouldn't it be great to be able to register
   a public key with the court of jurisdiction and use digital signatures
   to validate the will.  I could change it easily any time I want without
   having to involve witnesses.  Or, just use it to append codicils to a
   conventinal will without a lot of hassles.   But, alas, the legal system
   hasn't evolved to the point where this is yet possible.  Maybe in my
   lifetime, though...

2. I've also been wondering lately what it really means (or should mean)
   to put a digital signature on a file.  If the file contains a legal
   document, it could probably be inferred that the responsibility to the
   digital signor is the same as had he signed a physical copy.  But should
   it be the same as a witnessed or notorized signature?  The latter provides
   allows for some later testamony about state of mind and coersion that is
   lacking with a digital signature.  Also, what if I sign, say, a tax
   assessment form?  Does this mean that I agree with it and waive the right
   to dispute it later, or does it merely indicate I acknowledge having
   seen it personally.  Even though digital signatures are a powerful tool,
   it seems there is still a great deal of legal framework remaining to be
   built around them.

Three problems with this argument, David:

First, the United States Senate, in a 1982 report titled 
"The Right to Keep and Bear Arms," has specifically said that
"what is protected is an individual right of a private citizen
to own and carry firearms in a peaceful manner."

Second, the amendment never says that it is only the *militia* who
has a right to keep and bear arms. It says that in order in *insure*
a well-regulated militia, the right to keep and bear arms shall not
be infringed. 

And even if we do conclude that only the militia can keep and bear
arms, here is Webster's definition of a militia:

	mi-li-tia \me-'lish-e\
	[L, military service, fr. milit-, miles]
	1: a part of the organized armed forces of a country liable to call
	     only in emergency
	2: the whole body of able-bodied male citizens declared by law as being
	     subject to call to military service
	-- mi-li-tia-man \-men\ n

Both these definitions are basically the same: people who *can* serve
in the military by way of the draft, *NOT* exclusively military
personnel.

Most people tend to assume that "militia" == "military"; this is
incorrect. Similar roots don't necessary imply similar meanings;
compare "pedestrian" and "pediatrist".

Public airwaves are a limited resource, and thus there are stronger
regulations imposed upon them.  Speaking via wires, of course, depends
on who owns the wires (or fiber or whatever) and whether it is a common
carrier or what.

If you search my apartment for evidence to use against me and find a
document written in Chinese, can you force me to translate it into
English for you?

How about if it's in an obscure dialect, and nobody versed in it can be
located?

In the case above, you can subpoena the plaintext.  Of course, you can't
subpoena it from the guy himself, since that would be self-incrimination.
Because such a law would violate Constitutional protection against
self-incrimination, yes, it would be "somehow not a legitimate law."
Of course, if anyone other than the guy in question knows the plaintext,
or key, or something else about the material, you can always make
him(her) testify.

The govt can issue a warrant to search your premises, but you don't have
to help them find things or understand the meaning of what they find.

No, it isn't.  However, personal information which is not obtainable
without my cooperation (such as facts I have memorized) cannot be
obtained without my consent for use against me.  If you disagree with
the Founding Fathers on this one, OK, but don't expect others to like
that position.

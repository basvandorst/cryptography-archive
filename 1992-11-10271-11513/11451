When the concept of the cashless society comes up it usually involves the
government intentionally pushing it into place. While this may happen, a more
self-generating path is currently underway.
.
Many/most people have ATM cards. Since ATMs are more accessable than banks,
people tend to use them. I used to fill my pockets once a week, but now it's
more convenient to push the "fast cash - $40" on the ATM which is usually
a mere 100 feet out of my path, wherever I may be going to spend money. I think
most people are leaning in this direction.
.
ATMs are still less than completely convenient: one must _find_ an ATM and
go use it to get some paper that will be traded for good/services, often
just minutes later.
.
Around here, Burger King and numerous gas stations recongnize that the
inconvenient link is the cash, and have POS (point-of-sale) card readers.
People resist them at first, but when they want lunch NOW or some gas NOW
and don't have any cash, but do have plastic, they try the POS card reader.
"Wow, that was easy!" Same reaction as their first experience with an ATM.
.
Since the POS card reader demonstrates an increase in profits for the business
using it (people who don't have cash at some moment can still spend money),
other businesses try it. And a few more. And more. And like any other
technology, as more people use it, more will want it, cost goes down,
acceptance goes up, and suddenly it's an indespensable part of daily existance.
Just review the controversies that surrounded ATMs when they first appeared.
.
Sure, there will be problems:
.
1. The amount of data flowing in a cashless society will be enormous, far
beyond what we can currently handle!
.
Currently, yes. These things don't happen overnight. If cost < profit, someone
will provide the means. Remember, when 1200bps modems were arriving, most
people considered that to be the limit of what phone lines could handle.
I'm writing this post using a 14400bps modem, and that's - now - not
outstandingly fast. Someone, when told that telephone-based video could
produce a $50 billion industry, commented "for $50 billion, an engineer would
gladly figure out how to run muliple video lines over barbed wire."
.
2. Transactions would be monitored! Anonymity would perish!!!
.
Most people don't care unless they see a direct, emotionally unplesant result.
As long as it (a) makes life simpler for them and (b) provides some sound-bite
that gives them warm fuzzies, they won't care. Consider the following sound-
bite selling points and how the general public will react:
        - You'll never have to suffer thru tax-time forms again! The
        IRS will simply send you a bill, accurate to the penny!
        - Evil drug-lords, and other crooks will be sniffed out and punsihed!
These don't have to be rational points - just as long as it sounds good to
the uneducated public.
Mob force is unpleasantly amazing.
.
3. People will spend themselves into oblivion!
.
Try a smart card that tells you how much cash you have _on_its_face_.
Just like looking in your wallet. Sure, some will still spend into oblivion,
but our increasingly sociallistic system will happily put them back on
their feet.
.
4. Counterfiting will be easier!
.
Maybe. Depends on how the system is implemented. Remember: governments tend
to like to have large-scale criminals around, and small-scale ones can be
identified with a decent system. Consider the security around just
counterfiting VISA cards - not too much media hype about that.
.
.
.
I think the cashless society will happen. It's just another technology that
(supposedly) makes our life easier, is profitable for those who provide it,
and makes the government happy by providing more monitoring.
.
Scenario: You have to go somewhere _right_now_. You are broke.  The car needs
gas to get there. You have your plastic. Wouldn't you be happier if the
gas station on the corner had a POS cash/credit-card reader?

Most people agree that the government is largely sluggish and ineffective.
Then why do most people demand that it do everything for them?

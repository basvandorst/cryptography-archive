First off, the "dozens to thousands of hours" is the time to break
the whole _method_.  Once that is done the specific messages become
close to trivial.

Oh, c'mon now.  If the scheme is to be used by more than a
small handful of people then at least the executable will
be available for analysis.  And with a suitible effort at
disassembly/decompiling it can be analysed for the underlying
algolrithm.


Your proposed modification of the prize to include airfare in
addition to dinner is much better incentive -- before you
were suggesting that someone spend their time breaking your
system and spending hundreds of dollars of their own money
in order to claim a "free" dinner.  Didn't sound like much
of an inducement to me.

As to why I'm not picking this up:  I'm a crypto-protocol
kinda guy; I take secure encryption as an abstrict axiomatic
primitive and work from there; I'm not well versed in
traditional cryptanalysis.

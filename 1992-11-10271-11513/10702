So, there's some guy who they suspect might be a molester who has some
encrypted files.  How do they know he's one?  How do they know the
encrypted stuff pertains to molestation?

Well, tell your law enforcement friend that, if nothing else, they could
try to bust the guy for using unlicensed software...

More seriously, PGP is normally used to communicate with other people,
not to store stuff personally.  They should find out with whom it was being
used to communicate (probably possible) and subpoena the information from
them.

(It's not clear to me what sorts of things it would be used for anyway.
Did the guy encrypt a diary of his crimes?  Was it being used to arrange
meetings with others for the purpose of molesting kids?  Poetry composed
after the foul deed was done?  What?)

"The right to free speech includes the right to speak in a fashion not
easily understood by others."

(Disclaimer:  I do not think that the Right to Keep and Bear Keys (RKBK)
has much of anything to do with RKBA.)

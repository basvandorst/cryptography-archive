And that is the point.  People want drugs, people want sex,
and people want cryptography.  You WILL NOT be able to get
everyone in the U.S. to register their keys, and in particular,
people using their keys for illegal purposes will be the ones
who tend not to register them, making the whole registraiton
process USELESS precisely the way drug and gun bans are now. 

How do you get criminals to register their keys?

Or, is the purpose of key registration specifically to
use the crime of not having a registered key the method of
incarcerating criminals who have been wire tapped after
a court order has been issued?

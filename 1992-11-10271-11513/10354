Not exactly.  You can still refuse to talk.  According to what I have read,
you must refuse to talk with them AT ALL, including agreeing to your name,
in order to protect your 5th Amendment rights....but you do have them. 
Grand Juries cannot offer immunity, and the DA usually cannot offer
sufficient immunity for their usual fishing expeditions to be allowed to
override your 1st and 5th Amendment rights.

I could be wrong.

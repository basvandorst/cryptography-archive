Even if one had forgotten every instance in which the government has
stepped on individual privacy in the past, one would have to look only
so far back as the election-time State Department passport scandal to
be reminded that the government can rarely be entrusted with issues of
personal privacy.  If that's not plain-as-day evidence that proposals
to regulate cryptography are just plain stupid, I don't know what is.

A very simple way to hide a message is the following:

Suppose your favorate Mafioso wants to send you a secret message. He
encrypts it with a non-registered key. Now he takes a digital picture of
his nice family (say with 8 bits per pixel) and replaces each low-order bit
with one bit of the message. If the color palette is suitably chosen or it
is a grey-scale picture or a 24 bit true color picture or similar, this
will not change the picture much, but just add a bit of noise. How is the
government to prove that the picture contains an encrypted message?

(NOTE: this method is an adaption of something that was published earlier
in sci.crypt)

Of course this method is difficult to use for encrypted telephone communication.

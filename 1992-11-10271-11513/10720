Clearly?  Or maybe a believer in not implementing a "solution" that
has proven to only aggravate the problem whem implemented, again and
again.   Stricter gun control or bans has never been followed by a 
drop in violent crime, always instead an increase or no effect, exactly
the _opposite_ of the goal of such measures as you advocate.

Never use them?  Where did you get that?  They use them an estimated 650000-
to 1 million times each year  for defense & to prevent serious crimes, and
used countless daily millions of times for target and recreation.

	That's funny because it fits so closely to the Ben Franklin
quote on the subject.

Ok, assume the guns are used on average once per week (twice for some,
daily for other recreational shooters, seldom for others), that's 100
billion uses and 12000 homicides.  A miniscule fraction results using
your math.    Actualy, the only relevent homicides for such an equation
would be the _variable_ & _unlawful_ homicides that would be eliminated
by your ban.  This would be a very small subset of that 12000 indeed.

When you add back in all the extra knifing, clubbing, and other strongarm
non-gun murders that result from your ban, implementing a ban turns out to 
be very costly using "death math" like you do above.

Fortunately or unfortunately, Swart's stuff is like the "proofs"
of Fermat's last theorem that turn up from time to time.  He
first released his P=NP "proof" in the early 80's and has been
trying to patch up the mistakes ever since.

Also, nobody has ever proved that graph isomorphism is NP-complete,
unlike those other problems.  There is a clever argument by Goldwasser
and Sipser from a few years ago that graph isomorphism is probably
*not* NP-complete.  (I don't keep up with this field and don't
know what's been happening since then.).

It is true that if P=NP then all cryptography everywhere (not just RSA)
is dead; but at this point I wouldn't take Swart's claims seriously
without seeing some consensus among complexity efforts that unlike
his previous attempts, his latest effort is free of bugs.

In some cases, the bank is not allowed to tell you, ever.  In others,
notification may be postponed indefinitely.

I'm not going to regurgitate the source of this.  Please read _Your
Right to Privacy_, by Evan Hendricks, Trudy Hayden, Jack D. Novick,
1990.  This is an ACLU Handbook and is just jammed packed full of
useful tidbits.

Such as, the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 requires a bank to make records
of all transactions over $100 in a checking account.  The banks
actually microfilm _all_ checks because it's cheaper than sorting.
These records may be examined subject to the provisions of the Right
to Financial Privacy Act of 1978, but these provisions are rather
broad.

Well, SOME (or in your case - most) of the "ordinary" citizens don't
feel the need... And crime rate isn't directly proportional to the
legality of the gun ownership...

Yes, I do. If you wish I can e-mail it to you (and/or to others,
if the amount of e-mail isn't too big :-). Note, that you need
a DES package (to which aformentioned macros are inteface).
Of course, if it's an Obcrypt, as you said - please
disregard this posting (:-).

What are theoretic ways to deter a plaintext attack?

i.e. The opponent is given two ciphertext messages, the plaintext of
the first message, and the encryption method.


Now, obviously the longest key in the world will not help.

How does one protect the key, so that it can be reused.

There can be no pre-arranged protocol for the message, other than the
keytext, and the encryption method, which stays the same for both
messages.


Take for example, the simple case of an arithmetic repeating key cipher:

ciphertext[i] = plaintext[i] ^ keytext[i%7]
[^ -> XOR]
[% -> modulo]


if the attacker knows both plaintext and ciphertext, the solution is
trivial, and the key is discovered.  How can one modify such a
method to make discovery of the key more difficult?

 I don't hold a "position" in the sense that you mean.

 My actual "position" is that, should government be moved to do
 so, it *can* find *some* way to pass laws limiting the use of
 cryptography which *will* withstand judicial review.  There are
 probably many ways open to canny lawmakers which I could not
 begin to guess.

 As a simple engineer, one way I would imagine that this could be
 done is to require the licensure of everyone who uses serious
 cryptography.  There could be varying penalties for "ciphering
 without a license," depending on previous infractions and the
 seriousness of the case.  A requirement for licensure would be to
 agree to uphold the cryptography laws, and to retain (log) all
 keys used in ciphering for future audit (under due process).

 This would accomplish the goal of being able to convict criminals
 who use cryptography to hide their illicit activities; the charge
 would be "ciphering without a license," or "failure to reveal"
 (due process access).  This would be similar to the way "tax
 evasion" charges are used now.  The infractions could be part of
 the evidence presented to the jury in a larger case.

 The government would probably be lots slicker than this in real
 life, but this scenario serves as a warning of what could happen
 to cryptography.  Actually, this scenario may be one of the
 softest and *best* we could hope for, because it would prevent
 "fishing expeditions" which seek information only to develop a
 case, and not for presentation in court, and it would also
 inform the target at the time of the audit.  The government will
 first try for *far* more stringent legislation.  *That* is what
 we need to defeat.


 Now, the first thing we need to do to prevent this is to see how
 good the arguments on the other side really are.  This apparently
 requires a degree of openness which many find difficult to accept.

 Then, once we have the good arguments, and the analysis used in
 picking those arguments, we may decide that completely unrestricted
 use of cryptography really is *not* in the interests of society.
 We might try to find opposing arguments which could help define
 the legislative and public debate on the issue, and decide on
 positions which, while not what we could prefer, we could still
 live with.  Or we could decide not to participate, and hope
 everything works out OK.

 There is not much magic here, but this simple process, the normal
 way one might go at finding the truth amidst two polarized sides,
 somehow seems to be taken as a radical agenda.  Is the possibility
 of finding or revealing an unpleasant truth really that scary?  Or
 does nobody even care?

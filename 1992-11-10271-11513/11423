I've seen this arguement many times from many people over the past few
weeks.  So I'm not flaming John when I express my less than favorable
impression of the idea.

Taking this to its illogical extreme, why don't we just make _everything_
illegal.  That way, when one of us commits a "real" crime, law enforcement
personnel will have a wide variety of options for putting the offender away.

They got Al Capone for tax evasion.  They might get _you_ for speaking
ill of a "person of color" or for using cryptography to keep secrets, even
though they want you for child molestation or just want to harrass you for
your non-mainstream ideology.  Of course they'd never be able to prove it -
you're innocent of any "real" crime.  But they don't even bother to try.
They just confiscate your transportation and lodging in retribution for the
unreal offenses.

Too many small things illegal = too much coercive power in the hands of the
state.

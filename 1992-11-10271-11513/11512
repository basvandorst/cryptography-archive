	Well, the problem may be that they request for "cashier's check"
was taken too literally.  I don't particularly like to use plastic
money, and deal in cash as much as possible.  I've bought automobiles,
computers and other big ticket items where a personal check is generally
NOT adequate for the desired purpose.  On one such occasion, I went to
the bank to get an offical check for the amount (5200+) and the
appropriate instrument at that bank was a "treasurer's check" rather
than a "cashier's check".   I've never come across a commercial bank
that refused to honor another commercial bank's official check.  Most of
the car dealerships and merchants also understand the instrument.

	I believe that the distinction between a "cashier's" check and a
"treasurer's" check is entirely up to the issuing institution.  I'm sure
that if you had qualified for a loan from the institution in the amount
of the total purchase price of the computer system you were after, that
they would have given you an official bank check for that entire amount.
If you've ever arranged the financing for an automobile for yourself
(rather than letting the dealership do it and take a profit on both ends
of the transaction!)  the lending institution will tell you the upper
limit of the amount you qualify for, and how long the offer is valid,
and perhaps the brands of cars that they will honor the deal for.  Then,
when you've made your selection, you call the lender (or go to the
lender) and tell them to issue the check for such an amount to the name
of the selected dealership.

	Often times, having your financing pre-arranged with a credit
union or your own bank lets you deal with a dealership as if you were
using "cash" as the payment option.   The car dealerships often drool
over the potential of not having any risk and not having to arrange the
financing themselves.  To them, the "treasurer's check" from your lender
is as good as cash!

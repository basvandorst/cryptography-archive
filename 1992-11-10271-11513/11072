	Gontier is now on record as endorsing the prohibition
	of tobacco, prohibition of alcohol and (apparently)
	prohibition of religion.

	Where is he posting from, again? Iran?

	Not relevant. Is Gontier asserting that there is no
	right to self defense?

<   An aside: why is it that terms like "law-abiding" creep into
<   these descriptions? 

	Because handgun bans only disarm people who obey the
	law; those people are called "law-abiding". Those
	who prey on others are called "criminals"; they do
	not obey laws, not even gun laws.

	See Washington, DC for further details...

<Are criminals unable to derive the same

	Not legally.

<   Name just about any country in the EC. 

	Ok, let us do so:

	France: no ban on handguns, here, although military
	        calibers are restricted. This means that a
	        .44 magnum is easier to get than a .45 ACP.
	Germany: No ban on handguns here, although one generally
	         must belong to a club.
	Belgium: No ban on handguns here.
	United Kingdom: No ban on handguns here, either.
	Italy: No ban on handguns here, although the law is similar
	       to France.

	Switzerland: no ban on handguns here; furthermore, military
	   	     calibers are legal to own AND the handgun permit
	  	     is also a Concealed Carry Permit.

	Perhaps Gontier has not researched this issue very much?

<Remember, we're talking
<   about kids finding Daddy's gun and shooting each other with it out
<   of ignorance. That's *all* I'm talking about.

	Gontier wants to ban all handguns because less than 
	1,400 children die per year from accidents.

	One awaits Gontiers demand to ban bicycles; MORE
	than 1,400 children are killed while using them
	every year.

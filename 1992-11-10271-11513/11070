James Campbell * 1) Why did he have to  call Little Rock when just about
                 any university  in California could have  FTP'ed a copy
                 for  him, and  many  California  BBS's carry  PGP20 and
                 PGP20SRC?
                                 = = =

  He called  the author and  the author  pointed  him to us  as a easily
  accessed system with which to pick it up.

James Campbell * 2)  How can  he have  identified the  guy as a molestor
                 (not "alleged molestor") when the ONLY evidence against
                 the guy is in PGP-encrypted files?
                                 = = =

   My fault here.. 'suspected' or 'alleged' was definately in his typing
   tone.

James Campbell * 3) How  does he even  know that the  files contain such
                 evidence?
                                 = = =

    I did not ask.

James Campbell * 4) If  he doesn't have  PGP yet, how  does he know  the
                 files are PGP-encrypted?
                                 = = =

     I can only assume  that he knew it was PGP due  to processes that I
     am not  aware of. I do  not claim involvement here  but, was merely
     transcribing what transpired in my own words.

James Campbell * 5)  What  kind  of  records  do  molestors keep anyway?
                 Having never  been one, I wouldn't  know, but I'd guess
                 that such  a "profession" would not  feel a crying need
                 for accurate books.
                                 = = =

     As  mentioned by  someone else,  perhaps a  database? perhaps phone
     numbers of contacts?  perhaps a diary of encounters?  I don't claim
     to know nor do I feel it is my business to ask.

James Campbell *     Also,  I  wouldn't  worry  about  the  distribution
                 aspect on this one,  Jim. Since the "molester" probably
                 would have used the -c  option to encrypt his own files
                 (why use a public/private pair?), he could have just as
                 easily,  and  as  effectively,  used  any public-domain
                 implementation  of  the  DES   to  serve  his  fiendish
                 purposes.  And the  DES has  been available  for MS-DOS
                 machines for years.
                                 = = =

   Pretty much what  he said.. and perhaps I was  a little shaken by the
   affair since he was the first  outside source to use the service that
   we  just recently  implemented. The   officer did  state that  if the
   'alleged' molestor had  not used PGP he could of  just as easily used
   other commonly available encryption methods.

James Campbell *     To  answer your  question, though,  I really  think
                 it's  a non-issue.  I mean,  I'm sure  the only records
                 that most  molestors keep are mental.  Should we pass a
                 law  that all  citizens must  keep a  permanent written
                 record  of any  "perverse" thought  that crosses  their
                 minds, so  even sex offenders will  leave a paper trail
                 to facilitate prosecution? Neither should encryption be
                 limited for  that reason. Besides,  what kind of  crime
                 would leave its ONLY evidence locked in the perp's head
                 or in his ciphertext files?
                                 = = =

   In  response,  and  I  draw  from  memory  of the conversation, Child
   molestation   and  pedophiles   are  a   well-organized  group   both
   nation-wide  and internationally.  <more  was  said>. Drawing  my own
   conclusions  here.  All  or  most  well-organized  organizations keep
   records.  Be it member lists, target lists, etc...

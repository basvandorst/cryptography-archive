There is a balance between the recovery of "public money" and not
removing the incentive to comercialise an invention. Remember that the
public also gets money back ( thorugh taxes etc) when an invention is
successfully developed and sold. It's little different from having
provided you with with your education- should your salary  and all your
property from high
school on be put into the public pot because the public provided you
with the education to enable you to work? 
Some government contracts do put limits on what can be done with work
carried on under them ( Recall the huge fuss re SMP by Wolfram (of
Mathematica fame) which was deveoped under govt funds.)Why should RSA
try to develope and comerdialise their work if everything is to go into
the public domain anyway?

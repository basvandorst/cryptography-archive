So are the rationals infinite in your sense. 5/7, just replace the 5 and
the 7. The cantor proof requires that each number itself be infinite, as
in the decimal expansion of an irrational. Thsu each individual rational
has a finite number of digits, even though unbounded, and they are
countable. Each program is finite though of arbitrary length and thus
are countable.

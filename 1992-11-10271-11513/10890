 In quotable email, <mike@upolu.gsfc.nasa.gov> Mike Jones responds:


>This has little to do with sci.crypt

 I disagree.  Should society elect to limit the use of cryptography
 by law this will affect cryptographic design.  Systems may have
 to archive old message keys, for example, or even ciphertext.

 Nonsense.  Two possibilities are presented:

 1) Require the use of registered crypto keys; if other keys are
    actually used (as we expect), this would itself be a crime;

 2) Require users of cryptography to reveal their keys (after due
    process); if they did not (or *could* not), this would itself
    be a crime.

 Nobody gets heated irons; this is rule of law.  The issue is
 whether a normal legislator could be convinced that this would be
 *bad* law.

 The question of whether a defendant has provided the desired
 plaintext can be addressed under oath by experts, and decided by
 juries.  Deciding issues of fact is what juries do.

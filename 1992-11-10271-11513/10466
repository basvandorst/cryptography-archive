True.  But no government where cars are registered has (yet) promoted
a policy to restrict or ban private automobile ownership.  When one
does, you can bet the registration lists will be used to aid enforcement.

Further, *every* government I know that registers cars taxes them.
Any guess what the registration information is used for?

Should the governement decide at some future time they wish to
ban, restrict, or tax use of public key encryption technology,
you can safely bet every dollar in your name that existing
registration lists will be forwarded directly to the office
responsible for enforcing the ban, restrictions, or taxes.

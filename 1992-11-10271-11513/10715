that's it? then your band-aid is closer to an iron lung. it's a 
drastic measure, costs a bunch, restricts the freedom of the people 
it's supposed to help & doesn't do anything to heal the original cut.

if you're worried "about kids finding daddy's gun and shooting each
other with it out of ignorance" then why not remove the -truely-
dangerous factor, ignorance? that would solve the problem without
any detrimental side effects. i, for one, plan to purchase a handgun
precisely so i can teach my children how to handle and respect
firearms.

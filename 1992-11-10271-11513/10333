Clearly, most gun owners in the US are responsible people and never kill
anyone.  This does not alter the fact that the number of deaths in shootings
is extraordinarily high compared to most other "Western democracies".

I am not rabidly anti-gun, I used to be a member of the (English) NRA, but to
someone brought up in a country where one never sees anyone with a gun except
at a rifle club, the thought of everyone being armed is far from reassuring.  I
am not that afraid of my government.

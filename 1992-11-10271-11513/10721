	Give one example of a country where their murder and violent
crime rate dropped as a result of a handgun ban.  I'll make it easy
on you in that you don't have to prove causation, merely show the
murder/violent crime stats for ten years following and preceeding
the ban.

	I don't think you will find one such country:  Perhaps
no "reasonable" societies as you think of them exist.

	Provide an example where a ban has solved this limited problem,
same crit as above.

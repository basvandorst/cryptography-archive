I personally think that "fucking a virgin in order to prevent
virgins from being raped " is more powerful and current than
"We had to destroy the village in order to save it."

My contribution:

In an ancient Kingdom there lived a Golden Goose the laid Golden Eggs.
As can be expected, everybody fought over the Eggs, which were the
main cash crop of the kingdom.

Finally, to end the turmoil, the king ordered the goose cooked for his
dinner to end the strife.

Also known as,cutting your  own throat to avoid being mugged.

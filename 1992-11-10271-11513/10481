The problem here is that both c and p must carry information and be
believable both in style and as a real communication.  ("The pen of my aunt
is on the table" doesn't pass as a real communication even though it parses
correctly.)  So, the encrypted text must be hidden in the free choices of
the cover communication.  Since that cover communication needs to be
uniform in style, so as to fool the censors, you have very few choices.
This means that the bit rate is rather low...or, in other words, the
ciphertext will be much larger than the plaintext.

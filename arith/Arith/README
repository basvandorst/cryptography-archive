This directory contains the routines for a library of C functions
which provides a uniform interface for multi-precision computations
both in the ring of integers and in the ring of polynomials over finite
field. The package is called "Arithmetic in Global Fields". It was
written by Kevin R. Coombes <kevin@math.lsa.umich.edu> and
David R. Grant <grant@boulder.colorado.edu>. It is copyrighted under
the terms of the GNU public license---see the files NOTICE and
COPYRIGHT in this directory for details.

The best place to start is in the directory Doc, which contains manual
pages and a user guide written in TeX. You can create and install the
libraries by typing "make" while in this directory. You can then
go to the Tests directory to try them out. Good luck.

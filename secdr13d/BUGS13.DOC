                    BUGS Fixed in 1.3A

The Version 1.3 key hashing mode that is supposed to be compatible
with version 1.1 isn't, the key is compatible, but the check bytes are
not.  This means you can't decrypt disks encrypted with 1.1 with 1.3.

There is code in 1.3A to change any "orphan" 1.3 check bytes to
those compatible with 1.1 and 1.3A.

If you have multiple encrypted Hard Disk partitions, and one is active
and you use CRYPTDSK to decrypt a different partition. Then the active
one stays active but is no longer being correctly decrypted by SECTSR,
leaving it in an UNSAFE condition until the next boot.

Version 1.3 SECTSR is supposed to have a check so it doesn't get
installed more than once, but this doesn't work.

Cosmetic:  Several msgs in 1.3 LOGIN/CRYPTDSK refer to "V 1.3" passphrases.
These references should more correctly be "V 1.1" since that was the
version that defined the new standard.  This would be even more
confusing now since V 1.3 is not completely compatible with V 1.1.

If LOGIN d: /PGP is specified, but PGP is not correct passphrase,
the correct hard disk passphrase not prompted for.

An article in the December 14, 1992 Communications Week describes 
an encryption arrangement said to be used by "many users", namely
using a public-key method to encrypt a DES key which is then used
to encrypt the message.

The article goes on at length but somehow manages to miss PGP, which 
I suspect is the most widely used software that does this.

The article mentions RSA, of course, and quotes Prof. Hellman.

The article then mentions that RSA's encryption is used in Novell
Netware Release 4, in Lotus Notes, and in Microsoft Windows for
Workgroups.

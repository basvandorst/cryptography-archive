And he's asking a perfectly reasonable question, see below.

And which is also patented, BTW, just license for non-comercial use is
granted.

I would be, but it isn't. Besides, I am perfectly happy to live with
an encryption scheme that only a forign intelligence service is able
to break... Gee, I would be proud if the considered my messages that
important... :-)

The above statement, is a complete mess. First, according to ITAR,
exporting of ANY encryption software might be illegal, not just of
DES. (I just wonder how all those crypt(3) functions in the Unixes
around were exported...) Second, it is not illegal to import something
that infringes patents, it might be just illegal to -use- it. Third,
those who are gullible enough to believe to your claim, and those who
are paranoid enough to be scared by them, can obtain PGP in a perfecty
legal way - from within the USA. It is available for anonymous fpt
from:

	van-bc.wimsey.bc.ca:/pub/crypto/PGP-2.1
	pencil.cs.missouri.edu:/pub/crypt
	soda.berkeley.edu:/pub/cyberpunks/pgp
	eugene.utmb.edu:/pub/pgp

and probably from many others.

Fortunately, the USA is not the only country that has programmers, so
there are plenty of free DES implementations around. I really cannot
understand why RIPEM is not available for anonymous ftp, without the
DES and the RSAREF stuff. Anybody should be able to plug in additional
DES- and RSAREF-compatible modules...

Would somebody care to post the specifications of RSAREF?

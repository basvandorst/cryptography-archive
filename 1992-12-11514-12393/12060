Youy are apparently talking about the violence done by the U.S.
government.  Yes, it is true that many lives have probably been lost
and ruined with the help of cryptography, but on the other hand
cryptography is a very useful tool in fighting against the kinds of
oppression and terrorism you are talking about.  I'd say it levels the
field somewhat.

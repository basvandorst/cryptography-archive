Yeah. If NSA will let them out of the country, then they can't be very
good at all. It's as simple as that.

I understand that for export NSA limits the key sizes for RC2 and RC4
to about 40 bits (although NSA doesn't want this fact generally
known). It should be apparent that keys this small can be easily
cracked by brute force on modern workstations, no matter how good the
algorithms themselves might be with adequately large keys.

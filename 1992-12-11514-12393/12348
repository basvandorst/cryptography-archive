The most useful aspect of a moderated group is to keep a decent level
of civility going. I don't think that would be a problem with a
true sci.crypt, so it's talk.crypt that would need the moderator.

Of course if a true sci.crypt starts attracting non-science flamers,
then a moderator might be useful for triaging out that traffic.

My own preference is for talk.crypt to be moderated, and sci.crypt to
be kept on point by peer pressure, once the split has taken place.

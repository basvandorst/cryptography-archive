Mr. Sternlight is probably refering to article
<pete.724907978@extro.ucc.su.OZ.AU> posted by Peter Alexander Merel,
not by me. I have never refered to him as having "painted himself into
a corner". To my knowledge, I've never posted a "slimy response" to
anyone, including Mr. Sternlight. I am agressive about positions I
hold dearly, but I do not post ad hominem attacks. It would appear
that Mr. Sternlight is the individual who is wrongfully lashing out in
this instance.

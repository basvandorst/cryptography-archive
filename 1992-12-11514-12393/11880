I personally am against it. It will simply end up being a 4th 
conference carrying the same material, and one more for me to go 
through on a daily basis.  Personally I wish that .crypt carried all of 
the material, and I would NOT find it replicated in alt.security, the 
pgp conference, etc.  As all of the discussion revolves around privacy 
through the use of cryptology, and .crypt is the conference for 
discussion of cryptology, lets END THE REPETITION. That, in any event, 
is MY independent vote.  I suggest that this ALSO be a proposal to be 
voted on. Finding the same 70 messages in three conferences today is a 
case in point!

Hmm... I've heard (rumours, rumours...) that thre is an exportable
version of MailSafe, which is limited to 512 (or was it 540?) bit keys
(or was it moduli?)... Does that mean that NSA can factor such
numbers?... Would be a pretty serous advancement in mathematics, not
just in cryptography... It would also mean that they find cracking the
key easier than the other forms of attack... Could somebody in the USA
check that there is indeed an exportable version of MailSafe and see
what the max key size is?

Regards,
Vesselin

Just an update for those who haven't heard: the foreign national who
was kidnapped has been freed and returned to Mexico.  The case against
him was tossed out for lack of evidence: the US gov't had nothing to
back up their accusations that the doctor who was kidnapped had anything
to do with the torture and killing of the American DEA agent, so the
judge threw them out of court.  It appears that the lower-level judges
are still somewhat honest even if the Supreme Court has been taken over
by "anything the executive branch does is fine" ideologues.

Then the prosecutors tried to get the poor guy held on the grounds that
he was an illegal immigrant!  (He was KIDNAPPED to bring him into the
US and he's being charged with being an illegal immigrant).

He's back in Mexico and here's the latest: now the US gov't has officially
asked the Mexicans to prosecute him!

   Until sci.crypt.research is formed (if it is), could I suggest that we
all put something in our subject lines to tell potential readers whether
or not to hit the delete key?  Something like "PGP risks (legal)"
could let the reader know we're not discussing weaknesses of PGP's encryption
algorithms.
   I support the new group formation.

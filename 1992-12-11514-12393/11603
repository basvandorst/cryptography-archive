Texas doesn't have Caller ID (sm) so I called instead of going in person.

Me: What is the size of a reportable transaction?

Bank: (words of non understanding)

M: What size transactions do you have to report to the Feds?

B: Basically any size we feel is suspicious.

M: Any size???

B: We are required to report any transactions we feel are suspicious.  For
   example, laundering money.  We must report transactions over $10,000 [sic].

M: And of course you have profiles describing suspicious persons?

B: Yes.

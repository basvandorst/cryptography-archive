As usual, David avoids to quote the appropriate message, when he wants
to twist somebody's words. Your key is not of any inconvenience to me.
I will not, however, remove it from my public keyring, until I get a
revokation certificate for it, regardless how this certificate is
produced. I thought that it might be inconvenience for you, not for
the others. More exactly - to your concsience, because you are trying
to convince us that according to you usage of PGP is either illegal,
or unethical, or both. Therefore, I proposed you to use PGP once more
- to revoke your key. Paul even suggested a way to do that, which does
not require that you use PGP yourself. Had you accepted this
suggestion, it would prove that you sincerely believe in what you are
trying to convince us. Now you have removed the last hope to
demonstrate even that and have discreditet yourself completely.

Right. There's nothing illegal in about that. But because you were
trying to convince us that you believe the usage of PGP to be illegal,
we thought that you would like correct an action which, according to
your words, has been illegal. You refused, which clearly demonstrates
how much you believe in your own words...

Right, nobody has ever claimed that exporting encrypted information is
illegal in the USA.

But you were offered the possibility to do this without using PGP
yourself...

The first time I heard such an attack described I was still in short
pants.  It was certainly long before the invention of RSA.  The attacks
described here are simply playback attacks.  These attacks are
spoofs by the attacker to get the sender to decrypt the traffic for her.

These attacks do not result in a compromise of the cipher.  That is they
do not reduce the cost of subsequent attacks.  Rather, they are attacks
against the user of the cipher.  They are attacks against the system.

All systems are vulnerable to this class of attack.  It is in part to resist
such attacks that we introduce time stamps and sequence numbers into our
traffic.  Note that if I alter the message, for example by introducing
the time into it, a reasonable thing to do in a confirmation, before
sending it to Eve, then when she decrypts, she gets garbage.  

These attacks result in the recovery of some, but rarely all, traffic.
They do not result in recovery of the key.  They are certainly not, as
the thread might suggest, "chosen plaintext" attacks, the purpose of
which is to recover the key.

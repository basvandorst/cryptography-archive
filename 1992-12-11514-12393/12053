Are you sure about this?  I thought it was *ALLEGED* to be in violation
of RSA patents, but never proven...  There *is* a difference.

The easiest thing to do (as someone else suggested), is to write a
generic front end with hooks for your favorite encryption function.
The front end could be distributed freely, as it contains no encryption
technology.  Everybody will be left to their own devices to obtain/write
their own function.

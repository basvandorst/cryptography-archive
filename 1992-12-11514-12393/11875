    As far as I know the most efficient way to solve this is to try different
    values for a until you get a positive integer for b.

Nah.  Modulo N, all integers are positive.  -2 is the same as 350,
mod 352. 

See any algorithms book under "Extended Euclidean Algorithm" for
more description.  Just think of it as the ordinary Euclidean
GCD algorithm, except you keep track of how much of each number
you throw away (sorry if that makes no sense).

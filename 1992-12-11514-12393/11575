The difference here is that it is the US government that is *instituting*
the *use*of*force* against these people.  Therefore, it is the *government*
that is performing the act of piracy.  They are outside their legal
jurisdiction and they are siezing private property without provocation.
No law was broken by the people in the boat because no governmental
entity has jurisdiction over private vessels in international waters.
The US governemnt used deadly force against a peaceful vessel on the high
seas.  If that isn't piracy I just can't comprehend what is.  Putting
around in a boat full of cocaine hurts *nobody*.  Let the nation
with jurisdiction (in this case Canada) arrest them for a *harmful*
act - *delivering* the cocaine for *sale*.

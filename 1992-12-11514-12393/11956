Apologies if you feel this is not the right newsgroup, but
no more specific group seems to exist.

Anyway, how can a device initially be securely connected to an
insecure network? i.e. anyone could attach a device knowing trivial
information. Problem is to only accept messages from a device
if it is known about. One idea I had was to inbuild some
code into a device which is entered into the main system. A match
could then be made between the id of a device and the id known on
the main system. However, someone might be able to extract the
info from a current device and then replace it with their own
device!

I'm sure that this problem must have had lots of work, can anyone
give me any pointers/references?

Thanks - George Bolt

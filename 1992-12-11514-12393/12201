If your intent is to warn us all that we might be breaking the law,
consider us warned.  Personally, until I hear from a disinterested
attorney with expertise in this field, or until I see a conviction in
a court of law, I'm not convinced.  But I have been warned.  Can we get
on with it?

+In Europe, where I have never argued RSA's patents apply, and I have

+argument also applies in the U.S.

If you really are arguing a moral stand, perhaps you can explain why
at the end of 17 years (or whatever the protection is for patents),
your moral and ethical obligation suddenly disappears?

+Thus I suggest for Vesselin's (and others') consideration that they
+may be violating the laws of the countries they are in by using PGP
+without (for example) getting permission from the appropriate
+Minister, as in France. If true, that would make all the posturing
+about how the U.S. Munitions laws don't apply to Europe and hence PGP
+is o.k. completely bogus.

+In the case of Vesselin, specifically, I suggest he check out
+the German crypto and Munitions laws, since that's where he
+apparently has PGP on a computer. If he's planning to use it
+in Bulgaria, he may also wish to check out those laws.

I see, now you are a shill for governments world-wide.  Don't you 
have any interests of your own to watch out for?

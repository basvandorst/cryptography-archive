I guess I'm about to make a stupid statement, since you never said this was a
*useful* protocol, just a *hypothetical* one.

Why doesn't Bob just sign some sort of digest of the message, rather than the
message itself? Not only would this fix the vulnerability you outline, but it
would also save on communication traffic.

I'm beginning to become a little frustrated with this discussion.  Patent
law is a highly technical field, and unless you're a lawyer who works with
patent law on a regular basis, I think it would be foolish for anyone to
give much creedence to your -- or my -- opinion on the validity of the RSA
patent.  Would you pay much attention to a lawyer's pronouncement that a
crypto system is secure?

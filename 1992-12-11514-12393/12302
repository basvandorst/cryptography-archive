I'd vote for this too.

I don't think so.  The only way would be for someone to 'moderate' it and
put a filter on the group.  Something along these lines would be great but
I'm not sure if it would be necessary on a 'research' group.  The big wars
going on are mostly just the result of crap that has little to do with the
technology/theory/etc. of cryptology and much more to do with government,
law, etc. (which would probably continue on sci.crypt but which we could
easily ignore :-).

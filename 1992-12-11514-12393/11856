Well, I personally have two other public-key cryptosystems; one is for
MS-DOS, and in binary form only; the other has source code in Lisp.
I've never used either of them much, as they aren't anywhere near as
good as PGP.

A de facto market standard.  PGP 2.x.  Presumably when 3.x comes out,
that will become the standard.  Think of Turbo Pascal.

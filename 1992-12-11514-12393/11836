Perhaps you have read different PEM RFCs than the ones I read.  The ones
I read did not make any reference to RSAREF.  In fact, I think they were
written before RSAREF came out.

There is nothing about the RFCs that is inherently US-centric.  There
are export laws regarding implementations of cryptography that follow
the RFCs (or, for that matter, that don't.)

There also is no reason that PGP couldn't have followed (at least
vaguely) the RFCs.  It doesn't.  My understanding is that the author
deliberately decided to do this because he didn't like the PEM system,
although I don't know this for sure.

RSADSI and PKP don't make U.S. export law.  With regard to export law,
PGP and RIPEM are no different.

Really, with regard to "the rest of the world" the only difference is
that PGP has already been successfully smuggled out of the U.S., while
RIPEM has not (yet).  It's entirely possible that, within hours of its
release, RIPEM will mysteriously appear on FTP sites in Italy and
Finland.  I won't do it, but someone may well.

Patriotism is, in fact, the *first* refuge of the scoundrel.

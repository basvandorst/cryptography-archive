Indeed.  Not surprising, though.

Warning someone that they are doing something potentially dangerous is not 
equivalent to "prosecution," as you so glibly pretend here.  Just the 
opposite, in fact--he evidently wants to help people avoid potential legal 
trouble.  To use a simple analogy--if I lean out my window to tell a fellow 
driver that his right front tire is going flat, should he get mad at me for 
his car trouble.  To take the analogy even further, does the fact that I 
might be in the tire business make me suspect?

It's not up to him--and if he did, why would he be warning people about it?

Now I'm confused.  How can you have played with RIPEM without having "seen 
compiled object code" for RSAREF?  This seems contradictory.

Well, speaking as a Macintosh bigot, they are both quite minimal, but that's 
rather beside the point, I think.

Nope.  It can use a central key registry, as well as distributed key 
registriy techniques (such as the convenient but insecure "finger plan" 
approach), but it in no way "relies heavily" on it.

Funny, I haven't seen MacPGP 2.1 anywhere... perhaps I missed it.

Mark isn't a lawyer.  Of *course* he urges people to read the RSAREF license 
themselves.  I'm certainly reassured by this--I like to be informed about 
what I am using, and I take the law very seriously even when I disagree with 
it.  Civil disobedience means *accepting the penalties* for refusing to abide 
by existing law.  If you are willing to resist U.S. patent law, you must by 
that action be willing to accept the penalties, such as the risk of civil 
litigation.  If you are willing to resist ITAR, you must perforce be willing 
to accept the penalties, such as the risk of federal criminal charges.  
Whatever your convictions, there is no free ride.

For the record, I oppose both software/process patents *and* ITAR coverage of 
software-only encipherment systems.  However, my intellectual convictions in 
no way free me from the fact that the current U.S. law remains in place.  I 
can choose to disobey it as an act of protest, but if I do say I am 
responsible for being prepared to lose.  For some issues, this is worth it--
for this one, so far, I think less radical attempts to change the law may be 
more effective (protest only works when people know what you're protesting 
about, after all).

My friend, the "Information Age" is just starting.  The last 30 years have 
been mere groundwork :).

I agree completely.

Are you afraid to stand up and be counted in civil or criminal court?  If 
not, I commend you, and wish you luck.  If you aren't, then I have little 
patience for your complaints.

That's all and good.  Are you willing to accept the possibility, though?

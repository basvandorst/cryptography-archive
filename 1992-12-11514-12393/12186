FEAL-8 is insecure.  A successful chosen-plaintext attack, using 10,000
plaintext/ciphertext pairs, was reported in the CRYPTO '90 proceedings by
H. Gilbert and G. Chase.  Biham and Shamir, in the EUROCRYPT '91 proceedings,
reported that FEAL with any number of rounds less than 32 can be broken with
differential cryptanalysis more easily than it can with brute force.

There is C source code floating around the net.  I have two versions, one of
which will appear in my book.

I don't know, actually.  If anyone does know, I would appreciate them telling
me.

>4) Is it a good choice for a fast, secure private key method?

No.

By the way, neither is a variant called FEAL-NX.  It's better than FEAL-N.
(FEAL-N is the FEAL algorithm with N rounds.)

Hello everybody,

	After talking to Aegean Park Press publishers,
	I'm happy to tell you, that they already have
	those two Friedman's books in print.

	C-60	Military Cryptanalysis - part 3
	C-61	Military Cryptanalysis - part 4

	(Or maybe it's C-59 and C-60. Check with them...)

	Their phone numbers are: (800) 736-3587 in USA
				 (714) 586-8811 abroad
				 (714) 770-7461 fax

	Their prices are steep, but I know of no other
	place, which provides military crypto books to
	general public.

	No' I'm not paid by Aegean park Press, just a 
	happy customer, am I. (:-)

	And thanks to those, who started the whole FOIA
	business, which forced NSA to declassify two
	more masterpieces of Friedman!

The issue is whether or not a law is sufficiently incorrect as to
contravene a moral principle, not a mere political one.

First -- the RSA patent does not claim the discovery of the mathematical
function, nor restrict the matehmatics.  What it does claim is a communica-
tions system based on certain equations.  If you found a different use
for the same equations, you could use them quite freely.

Second -- for better or for worse, the concept of the secondary market
is pretty fundamentally embedded in the American economic system.  Thus,
though stock ownership is, conceptually, a vehicle for securing capital
for new ventures, it's the existence of stock trading that makes it work.
(One could certainly argue -- as do I, in other venues -- that the trading
tail is now wagging the investment dog.  But that, too, is deeply embedded
at this point.)  So, too, the ability to assign patents is very important.
Why?  Well, maybe the original inventor doesn't have the venture capital
to develop the idea.  Maybe the inventor doesn't have the desire to run
a business.  Maybe the inventor doesn't have the *ability* to run a business.
Yes, there are certainly abuses here, too.  I despise the companies that
are in the business of patent speculation.  But I don't know how to ban
that without ruining the whole structure.  Look -- my employer, AT&T
Bell Laboratories, has an excellent track record for fundamental innovation
and use of its patents.  But the company also uses its patent rights to
trade with other companies for access to their technology.  Is that
speculation?  Or is it simply another way to use an asset that would
potentially be valuable even if that were outlawed.

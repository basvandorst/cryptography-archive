I'd consider using both MD2 and MD5 -- maybe as a cascade.  There's no
reason to make this fast (so MD4 isn't called for) -- and it's better to
make it slow.  The slower the code, the harder to do brute force attacks.

Note that passwords can still be guessed if they're otherwise guessable:
eg., a person's name.

I recommend password sentences.  My preference is for sentences (possibly
computer-generated) which are nonsense.  There are more nonsense sentences
than real ones and they can be strange enough to be easy to remember.

Eg., my friend Tom VanVleck coined the following MANY years ago:

	"Light bulbs are full of water."

It shouldn't be hard to generate your own patently false sentences.

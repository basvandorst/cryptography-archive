 I was never interested in flaming.  I posted what I thought was 
 a simple decryption challenge and got called names, both 
 publicly and in private e-mail.  Nice people.

 Yes. In its present design, it's mainly intended as a two-point 
 (A-to-B, B-to-A) system, but this is not really a limiting 
 characteristic of the algorithm, only a feature of its... ah... 
 current interface. Even in its present form, it could be used 
 between more than two points.

 If the system were as simple as that, that indeed would be the 
 result. It's a little less simple than that.

 Well, it _might_ be more likely, but we don't really know yet. 
 We think not.  The main, if not only, reason that we won't 
 make the algorithm public yet is that we wish to avoid creating 
 possible unwanted competition at this early stage of development.            
  
 Naturally, when the program is made available, (we hope) it will 
 become known.  It's just that it isn't available right now...

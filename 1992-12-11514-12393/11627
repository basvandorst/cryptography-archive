Wrongo bongo.  The "Commerce Clause" is used by Congress as the
constitutional basis for all sorts of things including, I believe,
drug laws.  Yes, I know it's stupid.  No, the Supreme Court doesn't
agree.

This trend started in during the FDR administration, when the
Supreme Court ruled that a farmer who raised wheat for his own
use -- to feed his farm animals and his family -- was engaged in
"interstate commerce".  The court reasoned that he and all the
other farmers who were doing the same thing had an impact on
interstate commerce, therefore the farmers wheat crop was subject
to federal price support regulations which prevented him from
raising the wheat.

I wonder if it's time to rewrite the Constitution and start all over.

Since you're posting from a .gov site, I think you don't have worries in
that regard.

RIPEM is not a standard, it's a program.  The standard is PEM (RFCs
1113-1115, if memory serves, though RIPEM is not complete as they
specify.)

Also, RIPEM IS NOT YET WIDELY AVAILABLE.  It is in use by a small number
of beta testers, who have been asked not to redistribute it further.  It
is not on any public FTP site that I know of, nor should it be.  It's
ready for release pending either approval of the powers that be at
Michigan State for use of their equipment for its distribution or
someone else being willing to distribute it.  Unfortunately, it's
possible that a distributor could be found responsible if someone
outside the U.S. gets the code from him.

I really wish RIPEM's beta testers would stop advocating its use as
though you could get it and use it today.  It will be soon.  It's not
now (or, if it is, it's against the express wishes of the author.)

(BTW, I had a somewhat positive response in alt.config, and will
probably newgroup an alt.security.ripem once release happens.)

Oh, so UNIX uses slashes for directory stuff!  Did they get that idea
from MS-DOS?

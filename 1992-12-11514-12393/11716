One of the sites cited as a source for cryptographic information and
software is ghost.dsi.unimi.it (at the University of Milan in Italy, I
believe). For several months I've been unable to ftp or send mail with
that site.

On exploration, it turns out that that site is disabled from the router
that services my site. The reason given is that the ghost site was,
some months ago, found to be the source of many accounts being
broken (into).

Can anyone shed any more light on this?

David

Fair enough, we disagree.  Because we don't (according to law) have
software patents in the US, it follows that software, by itself, cannot
infringe a patent, regardless of the patent claims.  Hence, in my opinion
(supported by at least one lawyer posting publically on CompuServe),
software cannot directly infringe on a patent.  However, if the only use is
infringing, it can induce infringement, and be subject to damages for
contributory infringement.

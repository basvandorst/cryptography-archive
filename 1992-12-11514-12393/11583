So have your friend do the decryption.  The point is:  If you & friend 
are "no cryptologist", on what basis do you go around claiming you've
invented anything?  Anyone can scramble up data and convince themselves
they got something.  A non-Physicist can easily convince him or 
herself that their well-oiled machine is really a perpetual motion
machine.  And, if trained people do not get the opportunity to
set their own tests on their own terms, such people will claim
indefinitely to have done so, based on their own flawed tests.
They may be happy, but nothing real has happened.

If you really respected our expertise, you would agree to the 
conditions of the experiment.  Get your patent and then come back.
But, if you want to save yourself several hundred bucks, take an hour
or two and try the challenge, first.

You persist in the flaw that there is such a thing as someone who
can _only_ be an encrypter.  Read the history if you don't believe me.
No such thing.  The empirical evidence is all over "The Codebreakers".

Exactly.  A mini-bulb finally glimmers.  But, unlike yours, my challenge
is eminently fair, as confirmed by a number of observers.  You seem
to think you can set an experiment any old way and prove something.

No, the purpose was not to start a puzzle league.  I was hoping to
pentrate what has up to now been an invincible ignorance.  Erik, I've
had about eight people bother to solve this puzzle, many with no prior
actual experience with such ciphers.  Most have taken between 1/2 hour
and 3 hours to do it, largely dependent on prior experience.  Most have
done it entirely based on the information in the note!  There are many
different ideas that work; it can even be done with paper, pencil, and
a hex calculator.  A couple had _never_ solved a cipher before.

If you and your friend cannot or will not do the work, then it seems
I've smoked you out.  You are not an inventor, but a pretender.  
You want _us_ to do all the hard parts of the invention for you.  If
you've had a "warm" reception up to now, it will get "warmer" still
after this stunning disinterest in the topic you claim to have advanced.

You are _not_ done inventing your system! Inventing algorithms is easy.
Proves nothing.  Testing and evaluation is the name of the game and 
you clearly won't even get your toe wet.  It is as if you had claimed
to invent the differential calculus and then said "hey, I don't know
how to do division."

Moreover, based on your few hints, the example was created to help you
analyse your own system.  If you or your friend _would_ take the time, 
you would be able to make a lot more sense out of our prior postings.
You might even be in a position to find any flaws in your own system
yourself.  You still seem taken with the idea that fooling us equals 
wonderful product.  Get real.

A long time ago, in the fifth grade to be precise, I was just where you
were.  I got the exact same advice from what seems to be a kinder,
more persuasive source than I am to you.  I had invented half a dozen
systems.  But, I took his advice; it was not hard and soon I found my
"great" ciphers were flawed without any help from anybody.  If you
read between the lines on these postings, you'll find others "experts" 
here had the same experience.  Your experience is as predictable as that
of a third year medical student thinking they have every illness in the
book.  You have revealed nothing unique about you or your claims.
We've seen them before.  Some of us have made them.  The difference is,
we got real and went about the effort to shed our ignorance.

How old are you?  Have you ever brought a product of any kind to market?
Do you really have any idea as to what you are going about?  You keep
talking about patents and the like, yet you refuse to cooperate on the
issues related to the most relevant science, and you cheerfully concede
ignorance, expect us to make bricks without straw, and tell the world you 
(and, presumably, your friend, if the friend exists), will remain ignorant.

Do you want to ship a real, working product or do you want to please your
vanity and pretend you have a product?  You are acting more like you want 
the latter than the former.  Indeed, you seem to think they are the same
thing.

Claiming to "only" be a creator of encryptions and not decryptions is 
much the same as claiming to be someone who can "add" but not
"subtract".  It is that ignorant, friend.  There is no
such specialization.

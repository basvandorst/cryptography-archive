#I know of nothing to suggest that MD2 has been broken.
#Certainly a scan of the latest CRYPTO, EUROCRYPT and forthcoming
#AUSCRYPT papers doesn't suggest that MD2 is insecure ... and rsa.com do

Sorry. I've received some email about this. I don't know where I
got the idea that MD2 was broken.

#not mention any known weaknesses in their literature on MD2, MD4 or MD5
#... although I should add that MD5 was developed as a "strengthened"
#version of MD4.  The particular
#application you are describing is (as you probably know, but others may
#not) the Bellcore TimeLink algorithm which
#is patented by Haber and Stornetta of Bellcore.  Patents are held in the
#USA, Canada, Europe and Japan with other patents pending.

Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Stung by patents again! I didn't know about this. Do
these patents cover the process of using any digest algorithm to
generate a timestamp, or do they cover only a specific algorithm?  If
they cover the general process, I'm not half going to be annoyed :-)
Is it really possible that a couple of guys on the other side of the
world can sue me for publishing the result of applying a public domain
digest algorithm on a file written by me? Ouch! Stop the world, I want
to get off :-)

#The patents suggest using MD5 as the appropriate message digest
#algorithm.  You must also remember that for time-stamping, the message
#digest may not need to be as secure as in other situations.  After all,
#to defeat the over-all timestamping algorithm, one would need to falsify
#a document which not only produced the same message digest but was also
#about the same subject matter.

Yes, but presumably, once a digest is cracked, it is cracked and you
can tweak any document to come out to a particular digest by tweaking
it in tricky ways. I don't think I want to toy with gray areas.

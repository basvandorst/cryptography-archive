Clear, and still wrong.  PKP is claiming that PGP1.0 was developed in
violation of RSA's copyright of some code.  _That_ would make it stolen,
but a redesign would still be allowed under the law.

Development cannot be in violation of patent rights, and the patents in
question are INVALID in countries other than the US (because publication
preceded the patent application), so that only use in the US can even be
considered as morally questionable.

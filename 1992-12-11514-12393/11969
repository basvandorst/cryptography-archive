         For that matter, look:

         Type bits/keyID   Date       User ID
         pub  1024/B33E65 1992/11/24  Jim Bidzos <jim@rsa.com>               

         So far as I know, no such public key exists. I just copied the
    sentences from Nobody's post, and twiddled them. 

         [DISCLAIMER: Again, I am not trying to make it look like Jim
    Bidzos uses PGP, or has a keypair in some PGP keyring. I am trying to
    point out that I can provide "proof" of somebody having a keypair even
    without generating such a keypair.]

         Besides, the point is irrelevant. The key was supposedly generated
    nearly three months ago; plenty of time for a change of heart about the
    ethics of using this program. (Not that I agree with Mr. Sternlight's
    points, but I felt the original post was a low blow.)

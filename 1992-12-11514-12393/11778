Arrggghhh, stop twisting other's words to suit yourself.  I did NOT 
state what you attribute to me, that conclusion is ALL yours.  The 
reason I specified that NO country had made drug use legal is because
the person I was responding to stated that some countries HAD made
drug use legal.  Those were TWO separate points.

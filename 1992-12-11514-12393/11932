The differential analysis results suggest to me that the DES transformations
divide into approximately 2^47 equivalence classes.  It does not seem at all
obvious to me that using the S-box bits as a key would produce a system
with 2^768 distinct equivalence classes.  It does no good at all to have
an enormous key space if many keys produce the same transformation.

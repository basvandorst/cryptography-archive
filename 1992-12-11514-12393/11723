Bill Stewart argues that the IDEA algorithm isn't covered by the
Munitions Act provisions. Though I hope he's right, I'm not so
sure. I think the Munitions Act covers cryptographic methods.

Second, his contention that DES was published in the Federal Register
isn't quite accurate. As I understand it, the details of the S-boxes
were not (though they can, I suppose be gotten via decompiling or
examining source code), yet without them one could not implement DES
and thus they are an essential part of the algorithm, in Bill's terms.

Please understand that I'm not trying to argue in a partisan manner here,
but to arrive at an understanding of what's so.

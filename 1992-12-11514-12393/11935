   does not use any techniques which are patented in the EC.

The IDEA cipher is patented in Switzerland.  I admit that I don't know
if Switzerland is considered part of the EC or not.

From pgp21/src/idea.c:

 *	The IDEA(tm) block cipher is covered by a patent held by ETH and a
 *	Swiss company called Ascom-Tech AG.  The Swiss patent number is
 *	PCT/CH91/00117.  International patents are pending. IDEA(tm) is a
 *	trademark of Ascom-Tech AG.  There is no license fee required for
 *	noncommercial use.  Commercial users may obtain licensing details

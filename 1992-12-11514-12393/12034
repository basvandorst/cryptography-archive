Actually, it does. The other country's laws might not recognise or
care about the U.S.'s laws. For instance, if the IRS thinks you owe
taxes, and you flee with the money to Switzerland, the Swiss will NOT
send you back to the U.S. because as far as they are concerned you
have committed no crime. There is no obligation for a European citizen
living in Europe not to use an object on European soil manufactured in
contravention of U.S. patents in the U.S.; indeed, I doubt you could
find a country with such a rule. "Contraband" only applies, I believe,
to something that violates the laws of the country it is smuggled
into. The "taint" wouldn't be recognized under the laws of most
countries so it doesn't matter.

Basically, you don't have a leg to stand on. Don't worry, though. You
can keep posting if you like.

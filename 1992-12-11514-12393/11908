I read the article in popular mechanics and have a few questions about how
RSA works.  You take the ASCII value of the number, raise it to an arbitrary
high power, and mod it by the public key, correct?  But how do you decrypt
it?

I finally discovered, at the age of 21, what all of my friends had found out
at 12 or 13-that your parents are just as fucked-up and wierd as everyone
else.  Politically Correct:  Socially, Politcally, and Environmentally
concious to the point of nausea.  tsa%cellar@tredysvr.tredydev.unisys.com

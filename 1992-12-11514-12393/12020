When mathew asks where he can get his free copy of RSAREF I fear he
is being both misleading and disingenuous.

He doesn't need one in Europe, as he well knows--RSA's patents don't
apply there and there's no ethical issue if the RSA algorithm is
programmed from scratch there.

He can't get RSAREF since it falls under the Munitions Act.

As for ripem itself, there's no reason one can't reprogram it
in Europe, to avoid export issues, and then there'd be a
compatible and legal version in both the U.S. and outside--
Voila! A "universally usable scheme" which everyone can feel
ethical about using.

The reverse isn't true for PGP since it is, by definition, currently
a violation in the U.S. even if reprogrammed from scratch.

The way around that, of course, would be for someone in the U.S.
to reprogram it using RSAREF. I understand a team is working on that.

If that is successful, then there'd also be a universal set of PGP
versions. I know it's inconvenient to have two versions, and some
might even think it silly (I do not), but it would be ethical.

Ethics is hard, sometimes, but trust me--it's worth it.

  Good idea, good name too. Suggestive enough to keep the politics out.

But please DO NOT moderate it ! Considering the percentage of various
kinds of traffic in sci.crypt at the moment, those interested in the
"research" will only move to the new group, and that should be small 
enough.

This posted to sci.crypt to attract attention to my request NOT to
moderate. All further follow-up to news.groups only please!

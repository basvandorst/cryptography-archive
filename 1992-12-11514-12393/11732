Steve, contrary to what you may have been told while dandling on poppa's
knee, your country does not actually have such rights under international
law. Believe it or not there's quite a lot of systematic rape, murder, 
torture, and general no good mayhem happening contrary to US law in every 
other country on the planet, and most folk involved in such activities would 
find your assertion extremely humourous.

This is not to say that your law enforcement agencies are not capable of 
such silliness - only that they'd need a good political reason to indulge
in it, and such a reason does not seem forthcoming wrt pgp.

I'm going to go down to the beach now and have myself a chuckle. Thanks for
brightening an otherwise humdrum morning.

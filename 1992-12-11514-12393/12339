The January 1993 Dr. Dobb's contains a description of the use of
Lucas sequences as an alternative to RSA for public key encryption.
I seem to recall a previous assertion in this group that the
Lucas sequence system is just a disquised RSA.  I don't recall any
details of the assertion or any follow up discussion.  Does anyone have
an opinion on this alternative?  The advertised advantage is that the
encrypted product of two messages is not the product of the individually
encrypted messages.  This beats at least one attack on RSA.

I have even more mixed feelings about this statement:

It seems to me that those trials of government officials that we have
seen have something rather grim in common: it takes a long time and lots
of money (our money, right? :) to bring the case to court, and longer
before the court makes a decision; when the court does decide, the
punishment for the offense is set at some ridiculously low sentence,
then the officials who were tried bring an appeal to court (using more
taxpayer dollars), where the original sentence is eventually dismissed.
This is an example? In all the cases I've seen, the charges brought
against such government officials would be sufficient to have a "private"
citizen hanged! If *I* sold arms to Iraq, I'd be lucky to even make it
to trial! My body would turn up in a ditch first!

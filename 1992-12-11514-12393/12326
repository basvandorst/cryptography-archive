OK folks, here's the PGP question of the day.

I am a Finnish citizen with diplomatic immunity residing in the United States.
I'm not sure about this, but I think PGP and RSA are legal in Finland.

I recently stumbled into a copy of PGP 2.1 on a local BBS.  Now,
hypothetically, if I obtained this program, would I be breaking the law?
My house is rented and thus not extraterritorial property.  How about
if I took it to a house owned by the Finnish government, and thus legally
considered not a part of the US?

Also, suppose I had gotten my PGP in Europe.  Could I legally bring it to
the U.S.?  How about the U.N. via the U.S.?  

Third, suppose I had a copy of PGP.  Could I take it to the
U.S.?  To other Finnish/non-American citizens here?  To the Finnish Embassy,
which is extraterritorial?

And a final question.  If any of the above were illegal, could PKP
sue me?  Could the U.S. government do more than declare me a
persona non grata and request the Finnish government to try me?

Thank you in advance.

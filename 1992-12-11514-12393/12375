Speak for yourself :)

What about us newbies who've never had the joy of iterating the
position, or even seeing it. Surely your not going to force every one to
wade throught 5 years of archived drivel before they can join? Besides the drivel
level here seems lower that say in sci.physics.

But yes, a moderated sci.crypt.serious group would be a good idea, with
the moderator pushing discussions, reiterations, flames etx into
sci.crypt. (Not that I'd want to be moderator- are there volunteers?)

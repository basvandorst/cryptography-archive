I just took a look at the WinWord "encryption" and it was
trival to break -- just an XOR-based scheme.  I tossed together
a little program that strips off the protection in just a
couple minutes.

If any of you out there have Word 2.0 files you want decrypted,
send me a UUENCODED copy and I'll strip off the protection and
send the file(s) back without looking at the contents.  Even though
this was trivial to write, I'd prefer not to send out zillions of 
copies of the program, since I don't want it to be misused...

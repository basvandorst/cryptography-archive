I'm glad you can draw such a precise, clear line between these two
categories.  Where would you place the mathematical expressions

C = M^e mod n
and
M = C^d mod n

given that they can be typed directly into some of the fancier
infinite-precision mathematics packages and executed? Is this an
algorithm (not controlled) or a piece of software code (controlled)?
Perhaps it becomes "software" only when I put semicolons on the end of
each formula?

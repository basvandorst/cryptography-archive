Perry Metzger has posted some slimy responses in the past, which I've
ignored, but his latest, in which he questions my motives, and then
states, as if it were a fact, that I've painted myself in a corner
takes the cake.

I have no hidden motives or hidden sponsors, have not painted myself
in any corner, and Metzger is beneath contempt.

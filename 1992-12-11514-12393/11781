    I do not find this story obvious at all.  Unless we are talking about
Burkina Fasso or Sudan, I doubt that any country would trust its diplomatic or
intelligence traffic to a product like PGP.  Real intelligence and diplomatic
services have had practically secure computer crypto for quite a while now.
If most American corporations won't let their employees use software that
hasn't been vetted by the folks in their MIS department, I can't imagine that
an intelligence agent of a decent government would be permitted to wing it
with PGP.

    It would not be above some folks at State or the FBI to circulate such a
rumor.  Absent any specifics, which you are not going to get, consider this
story nothing but the usual _desinformatsiya_.

    _Industrial_ espionage, now -- that's a real possibility.

  I don't doubt that a secure cryptography system will damage intelligence 
collection (at least here in the US), but who is the Goverment exactly serving
by restricting the import/export/use of cryptography systems?  The citizens of
the US, or itself?

  It seems to me that the US Goverment wants to have its cake (having a secure
cryptography system for its use) and eat it too (by having everyone else use
a weaker system (including its citizens) so that it can gather "Intelligence"
to protect itself (or is it to protect the citizens? 8-)

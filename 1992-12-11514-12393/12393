J. Edgar Hoover: The Man and the Secrets, by Curt Gentry.

There is not much technical stuff about cryptography in this book,
but many amazing, lurid accounts of FBI bugging and wiretaps, legal
and otherwise, and the things that were done with the results.

People interested in cryptography, privacy, etc. who liked "The
Codebreakers" should look for this book.  It's a $15 trade paperback,
less outrageously priced than the Codebreakers.

By the way, if you're in or near Berkeley CA, Moe's Books on Telegraph
has some used copies of The Codebreakers (hardcover) for about $35
each (they're $60 new).  They're on the 4th floor in the military
history section.

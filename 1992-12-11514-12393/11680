I'm the security administrator of ghost.dsi.unimi.it and I strongly
disagree with the assumption that ``the ghost site was, some months ago,
found to be the source of many accounts being broken (into)''.

I've been trying to get in touch with *your* system administrator
for a couple of days, since he never replied us when we mailed him
about the discovery of *your* /etc/passwd file in one of our student's
home directory. That student was immediately disabled but you never
cared to discuss with us about the matter. Adding an ``access-control''
entry in the CISCO router is not a good way for solving a problem -
well this is my personal point of view.

Regards,
David

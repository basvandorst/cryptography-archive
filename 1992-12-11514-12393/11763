Is there some way the public-key idea can be extended to handle a centralized
distribution point?  That is, A sends a message to a redistribution point
R, which forwards the message on to B, C, and D.  A performs encryption, and
B, C, and D all decrypt the message and get authentication that it was
from A as well.  R does nothing but redistribute, and contains no keys or
encryption software.

A would be responsible for collecting the public keys of B, C, and D.

Additionally, if someone would be so kind as to email me the FAQ for this
group, if one exists, I would be very appreciative.

Finally, is there an anonymously FTPable site for sci.crypt archives?

You might not like the law the way it is, but you are just plain WRONG.

35 USC 271 (g)
"Whoever without authority imports into the United States or
sells or uses within the United States a product which is made by a
process patented in the United States shall be liable as an infringer, if
the importation, sale, or use of the product occurs during the term of
such process patent.  In an action for infringement of a process patent,
no remedy may be granted for infringement on account of the non-
commercial use or retail sale of a product unless there is no adequate
remedy under this title for infringement on account of the importa-
tion or other use or sale of that product.  A product which is made by
a patented process will, for purposes of this title, not be considered to
be so made after --
  (1) it is materially changed by subsequent processes; or
  (2) it becomes a trivial and nonessential component of another product."

I've kept the above in here so that I can say the following:

You are constantly mixing your views of how you want the
laws to be rather than commenting on how the laws
apply.  Again, if you wish to partake in civil disobedience, that
is your choice.  The patent laws have been fairly heavily
used in other areas and have been proven quite consitutional.

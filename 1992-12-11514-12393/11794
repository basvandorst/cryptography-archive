Has anyone transport NSEA by Peter Gutmann (pgut1@cs.aukuni.ac.nz ||
peterg@kcbbs.gen.nz || peter@nacjack.gen.nz) to MSDOS?

I liked the portability. It compiled under TC++ runtime no problem but needs
this disk tutor tc++ 'shell' to run it. A stand-alone MSDOS implementation
would be greatly appreciated.

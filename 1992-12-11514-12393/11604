IMHO, if their entire case rests on encrypted disk files, they don't
have a case in the first place.

What grounds do they have for assuming that the files in question
contain anything interesting?  Did the disk have anything else of
interest -- erased files or scratch areas?  Amazing what some text
editors leave lying around ....

In addition, there is a cute little trick called a "contempt
citation".  Basically, they can throw him in jail until he coughs up
the key.  No time limit.  No indictment or trial needed.  I'm sure they
can come up with a way that it's not "self incrimination".  After all,
all they want from him is the *key*, not the information.  They already
have that (albeit currently in an unreadable form).

Frankly, it looks like somebody is pulling your chain.  Or you're
pulling ours.  This is identical to a strawman arguement that has been
floating around for several weeks.

To use your metaphor, the label is in ink which only shows up under UV light. 
And they only use UV lights in the USA.

So as long as PGP stays outside the US, there is no illegality.  But if it is
taken within the bounds of US law, the illegality appears again.

It's like copyright.  If a copy of MS-DOS reaches Singapore, it can be copied
freely, as Singapore has no copyright law.  However, if one of those
Singaporean copies is transported back to America, it immediately becomes an
illegal copy again.

Could someone recommend a book about cryptograhy (specifically computer
related) to someone of the following qualifications?
Much computer experience in hardware and software, and the standard E.E. level
math experience (DiffEq and Multivariate Calc) but little statistical or
number theory experience.  Somewhat facile with boolean algebra.
The book can be somewhat above this level, but nothing too simple
(Caesar cyphers, etc).  Something describing DES would be interesting.
Thanks in advance.

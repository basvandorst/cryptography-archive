  This is a formal Request For Discussion regarding the establishment of
  a newsgroup to discuss scientific and technical aspects of
  cryptography. The discussion has already begun in several newsgroups, 
  this is an attempt to formalize the discussion and begin the procedure
  for the creation of a new group.

  This announcement is cross-posted to newsgroups whose readers may have
  interest in the discussion about the new group. Follow-up discussion
  will take place in "news.groups". Comments may be emailed to me at 

  ts49+@andrew.cmu.edu

REQUEST FOR DISCUSSION
----------------------

NEWSGROUP CREATION
		create	sci.crypt.research
		Charter	Scientific and technical matters applying to
			data en/decryption. (as opposed to the law, 
			politics, licensing, and ethics thereof)

RATIONALE

  I believe that a new group is needed simply because sci.crypt is so
  high-volume, and has such a low signal-to-noise ratio, that it is
  essentially impossible to use it for professional discussion about
  cryptography.  I don't think that sci.crypt should be removed, but
  instead that a new group, which will coexist with sci.crypt, is
  necessary.

  The idea of a moderated group has been floating around for a while,
  and it appears that there is sufficient support for it.  

  However, in the interests of naming consistency, we should probably keep
  sci.crypt for the hobbyists and create a new group called
  sci.crypt.research for serious researchers.

  Such a partitioning strategy has worked previously with sci.math and
  sci.math.research, so a precedent exists for this type of action.

  The moderation policy should be fairly non-restrictive.  (Postings will
  not be rejected for not meeting academc standards, however redundant and
  off-topic postings will be rejected.)

NEWSGROUP CREATION

  Please post all discussion to news.groups.

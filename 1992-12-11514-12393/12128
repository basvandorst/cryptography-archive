It nevertheless is a complete mess, and you didn't bother to reply to
my arguments - you didn't even quote them. Instead, you are
introducing other messy arguments:

Could you qote the law that states that importing of patented devices
is illegal?

From PKP's claims. They claim that "in North America [hey, they seem
to think that Canada is part of the USA] a license is needed to make
use and sell" RSA-based programs. Nowhere is stated that a license is
needed from them to -import- such a product. (Note: we're not talking
about the ITAR restrictions here, only about patent infringement.)
Where David got the idea that a patent license is needed for importing
is beyond me.

"Some argue that it is so", but you said that it cannot be imported
due to the patent restrictions...

The mistaken one is you. One of the sites quoted by me is in Canada.
The ITAR regulations do not forbid export/import of crypto software
to/from Canada. Canadians don't need a patent license to do whatever
they want with PGP. Therefore, they have the full right to have it on
their ftp site, exportable for the USA. The citizens of the USA have
the full right to ftp it from there, because they do not break any
ITAR restrictions (which are even not a law, sic!). Therefore, anybody
in the USA is able to obtain a copy of PGP in a perfectly legal way.
Whether they decide to actually use it, to consult a lawyer, to be too
paranoid to do whatever with it, or to swamp the net with false claims
about silly local laws is their own problem.

First, it definitively does matter who did the importing - if I import
some drugs in your country, it will be me who will be prosecuted, not
Joe Public. Second, is passession of any munitions in the USA really
illegal? I thought that the Americans have the right to bear arms...
You seem to claim that they do not, just as they do not seem to have
freedom of speech, because it is considered conspiracy... I wonder if
they (according to you) have any constitution at all...

Maybe you are just not well informed what is legal in the U.S. and
what is not?

Two more points.

1) Patents cannot forbid the import of the source code of a program,
especially if you intend to learn something from it. After all,
wasn't the patent system invented just for that purpose?

2) PKP themselves claim in the RSA FAQ that they have a policy to
allow free implementations of RSA for learning purposes.

Maybe you should get your facts straight? Or, if you don't want to,
maybe you should stop spoiling the pleasure of the others?

Vesselin

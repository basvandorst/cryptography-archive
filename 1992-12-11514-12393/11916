The analysis seems reasonable to me.  Bidzos can deny that his statements
represent the position of RSA/PKP (and, in fact, he did, except to say that
their position is that you should use RSADEF subject to its license,
without saying what is in that license.)

ripem is illegal outside of the usa, and clearly belongs to RSA inside. 
PGP _might_ be illegal in the usa.

Did you read the Munitions act yourself?  How do you know that Bidzos
didn't make up some of the quotes, or that they have not been repealed. 
(BTW, it also appears that an act effecting which of
Commerce/State/Defense has jurisdiction _may_ only give to Defense what
Commerce has waived, in the case of published (or specifically,
public domain) encryption software.)  Consult _your_ lawyer, not that of
the opposition, if you want legal advice that benefits you.)

I agree with you on this one; IF Bidzos quoted the Munitions Act correctly,
and it has not been modified by other laws (as I noted above), then
importing or exporting encryption software would be an ITAR violation.  _I_
think he intended it as a threat, but it could be interpreted as a warning.

It actually seems reasonable to me.  I'd hate to be a D.A. persecuting/
prosecuting Miller.  Unless the government can find some excuse to make it
a classified trial, I doubt they will prosecute any ITAR violations on
published software.  On the other hand, the government can seize a
computer, and never get around to prosecuting.

There, I agree with you.  It is clearly illegal to post export-controlled
materials on a BBS.  However, R should then have been prosecuted for
writing his Scientific American article, as Scientific American is sent
world-wide.

That seems a perfectly reasonable solution to me... If David does not
intend to use PGP, then he shouldn't be concerned about the compromise
of his secret key. As a beginning, here is his public key:

-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
Version: 2.1

I have not tried to use key revoketion sertificates yet, but it
doesn't seem that difficult at all... I just think that David might
prefer an idependent party to do the operation, but I would accept to
do it myself, if he agrees.

No problems from my side - I find the solution perfectly reasonable,
practical, and satisfactory. So, now it depends only on David.

Vesselin

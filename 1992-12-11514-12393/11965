OK, here's a novel suggestion, which may (or may not) be useful:

What would be the legality of buying a copy of RSA MailSafe, and then
throwing it away and using PGP instead?  If I do that, haven't I paid
for a license to use RSA's patents?  Shouldn't this satisfy RSA and
PKP?  I mean, does the license *really* have to be tied to this one
specific application?

More generally, does PKP have any sort of licensing deal for
*individuals* to make use of public-key technology?  Does anyone know
what PKP's royalty arrangments look like?

Thanks,
--Pat.

Still wrong.  The author of PGP 1.0 didn't want to take the risk of
persecution (yes, that's what I said) by RSA/PKP, so he withdrew support. 
It was exported in apparent violation of ITAR, which is solely a US
concern.  (I say apparent because source code looks like technical
specifications to me, which are not subject to ITAR.)  RSA/PKP also claims
some of the code of PGP 1.0 was taken from an early RSA encryption program.
That would be a violation of copyright, which would make it illegal in most
European countries, as well, if there was any evidence of it.  There isn't.

There is no question of clean hands, as I see it.

In a nutshell, it is not illegal to write, use or distribute
encryption software  or hardware in the US and Canada subject to
copyright and patent law  or if the info is classified (ie a NSA
encryption program). It is illegal, by regulations (which have the
force of law) to export encryption software without prior permission
from the Dept. of State (which defers to the National Security
Agency on crypto matters). Those regulations are available in the
Federeal Register.

  The law enforcement and intelligence communities have been
attempting for years to prevent encryption from becoming widely
available. The NSA has threated several inventors over the past 15
years with the patent secrecy act, classifying inventions  that use
crypto. They have backed off a few times due to bad publicity but
may have succeeded many more times that we dont know about. 
   The FBI (or other LE) asked Senator Biden in 1991 to insert a
resolution in the Omnibus Crime bill that asked phone companies to
prove message traffic to LE in "plaintext" (ie unencrypted) when
required by law. The fear was that this provision could have been
easily and innocously changed to become enforceable. This provision
was removed after many, many people publicly opposed it. The FBI has
said numerous times in the last few months that are are working on
ways of dealing with encryption and will introduce something in the
future about it. They have also publicly stated (Asst. Director Al
Bayse in Fed. Computer Week, Nov. 1992) that they will reintroduce
the Digital Telephony program in 1993.

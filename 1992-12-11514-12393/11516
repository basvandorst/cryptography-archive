   I know nothing about the patent law implications, but the European
   subsidiary of a US company must adhere to US regulations regarding
   export of cryptographic equipment.  If the European daughter sells
   a product that would require an export license, the US Government
   can hold the US mother company responsible.

   That's what I've been told.  I'm not a lawyer.

So, on this assumption, my market opportunities are not restricted by US
participation.  Thank you.

Paul

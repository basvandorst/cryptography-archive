Not quite the same in principle.  The body of conventions that we call
International Law makes distinctions between piracy, revolutionary acts,
and acts of war (perhaps lumping the latter two).  The authorities,
when they're acting in good faith <insert your favorite smiley> are
obliged to make these distinctions.  Thus, one time in the 1960s, some
revolutionaries from Brazil (I think) took over a ship of their
country's registry on the high seas, and the U.S. authorities were
sweating over whether this was piracy (in which case they could and
should act) or insurgency.  Their inclination was to give it the benefit
of the doubt as insurgency, and in this particular case they didn't care
to get involved in somebody else's politics.  (Yes, that *can* happen!)

Actually a pirate or a slave trader is legally hostis humani generis, an
enemy of the human race, and any government has jurisdiction to grab him
and string him up (after a fair trial, of course), regardless of whose
citizens he attacks.  The argument has been made (e.g., in the Eichman
case) that war criminals fall under the same principle; I don't know
what the legal status of this argument is considered to be.

The discussion in this forum doesn't seem to have established that there
is formal recognition of dope dealers as  _hostes humani generis_.   Any
dope haters want to provide an unequivocal answer to this?

It's complete bullshit, of course.  Note BTW that a pirate commits an
actual, universally acknowledged criminal act _on_ the high seas; he's
not just sailing somewhere to perform one.  Likewise, the slave trader
is not just going somewhere with the intent to do something with slaves;
he's holding slaves right there.  One may see, if one is not too
determinedly blind, a useful distinction here.

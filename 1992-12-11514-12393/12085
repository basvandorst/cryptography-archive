Ha, that's very interesting! Could you please provide the exact
quotations that rule out the anti-virus software exports as illegal?
Maybe it would be a good idea to cross-post to comp.virus too...

As to the export of "big" packages regardless the restrictions, well
we have here a perfectly legally bought copy of Norton Utilities 6.01,
which includes DES encryption of the hard disk and bears the sticker
"Not for export"... :-)

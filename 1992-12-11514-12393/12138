	The rest of the message was unwarranted as well.  Jyrki 
	is not Anti-American.  He is merely anti-American government.
	That doesn't set him against any honest americans.  It certainly
	doesn't make me feel threatened.  Any american who has carefully
	watched his government's behavior and has a conscience is pretty
	disgusted by now.

Dear Readers:

I've been reading this news group with interest lately, and not having
the background, am struggling to understand some of the concepts.

One item that caught my eye was differential cryptanalysis.  Could
someone in laymans terms please explain to me what exactly this
involves?  Please send via E-mail, if you feel that this discussion
would not be of value to others.

Thank you.

The book is called:  _Mathematical_Cryptology_for_Computer_Scientists_and_
Mathematicians_, by Wayne Patterson.  It was published in 1987 by Rowman &
Littlefield.  I disagree that it is "quite good."  The book is riddled with
errors (most of them seemm to be typos, but some are honest-to-goodness
errors), the notation changes from one chapter to the other, and whole areas
of cryptology are left out.

The book is out of print, and I beieve the publisher is out of business.  The
last time I spoke with the author (a couple of years ago) he was thinking of
cleaning up the book and having a second edition published elsewhere.  As far
as I know, nothing has ever come of that.

The source code all works, though.

    PGP v. 2.1 is gradually making its way out into the electronic world.  It
has been posted to the FidoNet Software Distribution Network and should soon
be up on most if not all Canadian and U.S. nodes carrying SDN software.

    On the Internet, there are many sites to try for anonymous ftp:
    
    nic.funet.fi  (128.214.6.100)
        /pub/unix/security/crypt/pgp21.zip      (MSDOS binaries + docs)
        /pub/unix/security/crypt/pgp21src.zip   (Source code + docs)
        /pub/unix/security/crypt/pgp21.tar.Z    (Source code in compressed
                                                 tar format)

    van-bc.wimsey.bc.ca  (192.48.234.1)
        /pub/crypto/PGP-2.1/pgp21.zip
        /pub/crypto/PGP-2.1/pgp21src.zip
        /pub/crypto/PGP-2.1/pgp21.tar.Z

    ghost.dsi.unimi.it  (149.132.2.1)
        /pub/crypt/pgp21.zip
        /pub/crypt/pgp21src.zip
        /pub/crypt/pgp21.tar.Z

    pencil.cs.missouri.edu  (128.206.100.207)
        /pub/crypt/pgp21.zip
        /pub/crypt/pgp21src.zip
        /pub/crypt/pgp21.tar.Z

    soda.berkeley.edu  (128.32.149.19)
        /pub/cypherpunks/pgp/pgp21.zip
        /pub/cypherpunks/pgp/pgp21src.zip
        /pub/cypherpunks/pgp/pgp21.tar.Z

    eugene.utmb.edu  (129.109.9.21)
        pub/pgp/pgp21.zip
        pub/pgp/pgp21src.zip
        pub/pgp/pgp21.tar.Z

    For those lacking ftp connectivity to the net, nic.funet.fi also
offers the files via mail.  Send the following mail message to
mailserv@nic.funet.fi:

    ENCODER uuencode
    SEND pub/unix/security/crypt/pgp21src.zip
    SEND pub/unix/security/crypt/pgp21.zip

This will deposit the two zipfiles, as 15 batched messages, in your mailbox
with about 24 hours.  Save and uudecode.

    The Northern Lights BBS in Troy, NY, has both PGP21.ZIP and
PGP21SRC.ZIP for free download. Call (518) 237-2163 at 300-2400 bps 8N1
24 hours a day. Then login directly to the pgp account as follows:

	tnllogin: pgp
	Password: key

and help yourselves.  Thanks to Daniel Ray of tnl for this fine service.

    Another private BBS from which you can obtain PGP for the simple price of
the long-distance call time is the Grapevine BBS, the largest BBS in Arkansas.
It's run by Jim Wenzel in Little Rock.  John Eichler, a PGP user at Grapevine,
sent me the following information for your edification and enlightenment:

>   The GRAPEVINE BBS in Little Rock is the largest BBS in Arkansas.  To
>   help people obtain a copy of PGP21, the GRAPEVINE has set up a special
>   account for this purpose.  The following phone numbers are applicable
>   and should be dialed in the order presented (i.e., the top one first
>   since it is the highest speed line).

>          password: PGP

>       There is a special menu which one gets which shows the following
>   programs to be available.

--  Thanks, John!

    If none of these sites do it for you, let me know.  Film at 11.

    Best regards!

P.S.:  If you come across sites where it's posted -- especially FREE ACCESS
sites -- please drop me a line (info-pgp-request@lucpul.it.luc.edu).
I'd like to maintain a current list as part of a PGP FAQ list.  Thanks to the
many correspondents who have helped to contribute to this list on an almost
daily basis!

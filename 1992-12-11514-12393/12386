Yes, it is, assuming MD5 is a one-way function.

Exponentiation is also exportable.  With it, you can make RSA -- and make
it as strong as you like by making the radix larger.

It's the code using MD5 or exponentiation which would be the encryption
code -- not the digest or exponentiation code itself.

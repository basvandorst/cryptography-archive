    Once again.  Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk.  Who is going to do
    something?  For the record I am going to publish a number I
    want to keep secret.  I am going to raise it to the power of
    three modulo 91 which is the product of two primes.  The
    result is 34.  My wife knows the factors of 91 and will be able
    to decode this message.  I believe that according to PKP I have
    willfully infringed their patent.  I await a letter from the
    courts.

    My point is that *someone* has to test this patent claim!  How 
    can we force this to happen?  If someone does get sued are we
    all willing to contribute to the defense or are we all talk, too?

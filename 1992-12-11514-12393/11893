Dave, you bounce about better than a superball trying to salvage
your position.  Why not give it up?  I don't suppose it occured
to you that unless someone is convicted of the crime, it cannot
be "known" that someone "violated the munitions act."

Strange how you intermix ethics and crime.  Even if there is patent 
infringement involved, it is a civil matter so no criminal
ethics are involved.  On the civil side, things are far from as clear
cut as you assert.  The odds of the patent withstanding a challenge
are low.  Based on that conclusion, it is a simple matter of determining
how much financial risk one is willing to take and/or how much one
is willing to invest in fighting what he sees as a bad patent and
a bad process.

As to a judge putting a lien on your property, better hit the law books
again.  A judge may prohibit further infringement.  A judge, after
a trial in which the infringer loses, may fine the infringer and may
even return punitive damages and may seize property to pay said damages
but no lien is involved.  Absent financial gain, I seriously doubt
punative damages would be awarded and no actual damages can be proved
so where does PKP end up?  'Bout where the Prof said they'd be.

why not?  Because the patent may very well be bogus, even if it is,
we Americans have already at least in part paid for it once and 
PKP has contributed nothing toward aiding the development of PGP.
Enough for me.

I beg to differentiate! (:-)

There are two feasible attacks [on DES]: exhaustive search and differential
cryptanalysis.

While indeed Biham-Shamir attack produces a key with probability 1 with every
2^47 chosen plaintexts - how good a chance is, that your adversary can get 
that many encryption of his stuff performed on your DES engine? Or how
likely is it for him to have similar amount of known plaintexts (and
if he does have that much of it - probably there's no need for the
key anyway, all the data passed is there :-).

Thus the only practical threat left is an exhaustive search. And
I fail to understand why the DES with independent subkeys 
(760-bit key) is "limited to 56-bit key". I'd say
it's wrong, at least from practical point 
of view.

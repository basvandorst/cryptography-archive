What you are invoking is the so called "fruit of the poison tree"
doctrine. I'm familiar with it. It doesn't apply. As an example, the
book "Spycatcher" is banned in Great Britain, where it was WRITTEN,
but is perfectly legal here in the US and is in fact published. You
don't have a leg to stand on.

To focus us back, Mr. Sternlight contends that PGP is illegal in
Europe because it was written illegally in the US. Lets go forward.

Are we arguing ethics or law here? Legally, there is no problem in
principle. U.S. patent law does not apply, and since the international
agreements concerning copyrights don't apply since there was no
copyright violation, there is legally no problem, just as "Spycatcher"
could be published in the U.S. perfectly legally even if it did
violate the Official Secrets Act in the U.K. Now, on the issue of
ethics, you are conflating law with ethics. Just because something is
illegal in the US doesn't make it unethical. Are you, for instance,
going to argue that a heterosexual couple engaged in oral sex is
immoral? Its illegal in a large fraction of the states in the Union.
It is also, in my opinion, perfectly ethical if consentual. Here we
have an instance where in places like Georgia an act would be illegal
although in certain people's opinion perfectly ethical. All you can
give as an ethical argument is the notion that PGP is illegal in the
US and thus it is unethical to use it in Europe. That seems like a
very weak argument -- ethics are subjective things.

Legally, its perfectly fine. Ethics is a matter for dispute -- we will
never necessarily agree there. However, it seems that since you derive
your ethics from the law rather than personal principle, they are
fairly weak in their basis.

This reminds me of something I read on alt.locksmithing.  The analogy
between an encryption system and a lock on the door applies here.
Locks are meant to keep out respectable citizens, not thieves.

Burglars will not usually go to the trouble of picking the lock on the
door.  It usually takes too much time.  Besides, it takes years to
learn the technique (tools are not hard to get).

Instead, they usually kick the door in, or break a window.

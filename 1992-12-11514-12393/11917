Let's go over these points one at a time.

>PGP 1.0 was illegally exported from the US

That's the US government's problem, or the exporter's.  As the description
of PGPs protocols would be legal to export, there isn't really even a
"fruit of stolen goods" attack, unless PGP 2.x has code fragments from PGP
1.0 which weren't taken from programs.

>In the U.S. PGP was based on RSA's patents, and used them
>without permission

That's irrelevant.  PGP 2.x probably uses the material covered by RSA's
patents, but PGP 1's use of that material is completely irrelevant.  Use of
PGP 1 or 2.x in the United States may infringe on RSA's patents, but RSA or
PKP has to convince a court.  As far as _I_ know, no suits have been filed.

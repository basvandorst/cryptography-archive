An article in the November 27 edition of The Washington Post says that
NSA has reversed itself and declassified two cryptography texts.  Does
anyone know what these are about?  This was in response to a Freedom
of Information Act (FOIA) request by John Gilmore, who's on the board
of the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

If there's interest, I can type the article in (it's not very long).

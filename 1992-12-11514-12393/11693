Perhaps someone who knows and is not in the U.K. might like to summarize
or quote the offending material in "Spycatcher" that caused the ban
in Britain.

If so, perhaps they'd like to do so by starting another topic, os
U.K. readers don't inadvertently import that material.

If a reader who knows thinks the matter won't be of general interest,
or thinks posting it might create an opportunity for U.K. authorities
to interfere with the net, and would like to e-mail it to me (I'm
in the U.S. where the book is both published and legal), that
would be fine, too.

Thanks;
David

mathew corrects me by saying, in effect, that PKP aren't bending
over backwards to get non-U.S. users free public key software,
as they are for U.S. users by licensing RSAREF for ripem, since
RSAREF cannot be exported.

True.

Of course non-U.S. users have already created PGP, and can
just as well create a clone of RSAREF if they choose to continue
such things.

I'm not advocating, just commenting.

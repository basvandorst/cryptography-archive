I just recently compiled pgp 2.0 and was quite impressed by it.  However,
I have a question about how it works.

I realize that I can use somebody's public key and encrypt a message
to him, but what if I am say the president of a corporation and
wish to encrypt a sensitive memo to all managers.  Would I have to
encrypt the file however times I have managers, each to his or her
own key, or could I create a "list" of recipients?

I'm sorry if this is in the documentation, but I wasn't really able
to elucidate it.

Thanks for any help.

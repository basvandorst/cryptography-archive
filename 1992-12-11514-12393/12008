Marc VanHeyningen asks "what license fee?" for RSAREF.

I guess I have to spell it out. Some have argued that the most PKP
could collect in a successful patent lawsuit is damages, i.e. license
fees not paid, i.e. zero since RSAREF carries none.

My post pointed out that PKP could also get legal fees.

	I would like to ask, specifically, if anyone has information 
concerning encrypting/decrypting wireless phones?  Someone mentioned in a
recent post that Motorola has such a thing, but, how about AT&T or other
big giants? Do they have any wireless phones that are "secure" or are 
there any plans for it, on a wide-scale basis? I must say, that about a
couple of months ago, my son borrowed a friend's hand-held scanner, and 
began to listen, just out of curiousity.  When I heard him listening in
to wireless phone conversations, I became annonyed and explained to him
that it was not right to listen in on private conversations. I beccame
quite upset, knowing the potential of this problem. I see no reason why
for example, a base unit and a handheld cordless phone, cannot have at 
least the same privacy as a wired line.  For this reason, I am asking this
question as a serious one.  I surely would not like someone eavesdropping
on my conversations.  I know that the choice was mine, but did not realized
how simple it was to intercept a wirless conversation.  If there are no
specific wirless base-handheld phones that employ sophisicated privacy
features, are there any devices that can be added to existing wirless
phones?  Thanks.

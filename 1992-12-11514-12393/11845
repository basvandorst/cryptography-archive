	Sorry, but secret agencies are inherently un-trustworthy.  They
	are set up with good intentions but they are run by humans.
	Humans don't seem to be able to use great power in secret without
	abusing it.  Our history is full of examples of our intelligence
	agencies abusing their secret capabilities to suppress legitimate
	dissent and social change.  Fortunately, they were often unsuccessful
	but it was because of trusting souls like yourself that they 
	ran as far amok as they did.  Don't forget that the CIA experimented
	with LSD on unsuspecting people, the FBI spied on Martin Luther King,
	and military intelligence is currently conducting a witch hunt 
	against homosexuals in the military.  The fact is that our national
	security organs are no more trustworthy than anyone elses.  Now 
	that the cold war is over they must be SIGNIFICANTLY cut back or
	we americans will feel the brunt of their "covert wars".

	If we fail to trim back the national security state in the wake of
	the demise of the USSR we will undoubtedly have to fight them 
	for our constitutional rights in the near future.  Idle hands are
	the devils workshop folks.  Isn't that pretty obvious?

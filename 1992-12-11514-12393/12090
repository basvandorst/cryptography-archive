Vesselin Bontchev says he accepts the law professor's partisan
statement of opinion without considering my counter-arguments
because he is a lawyer and I am not.

Since the professor's message clearly is mostly opinion, and
by his language he reveals partisanship at the end, I suggest
that Vesselin's position is a straight appeal to authority,
without considering the substance.

That seems very odd to me, given that most of those arguing against my
position explicitly reject authority when it doesn't suit their
arguments.

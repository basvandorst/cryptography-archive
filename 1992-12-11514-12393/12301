Starting sci.crypt.research sounds good to me.

Is there some way to run an unmoderated newgroup with some kind of special
software to limit the number of postings to one per day from each person?
Think what that would do to the flame wars.  There could still be political
discourse, but rationed postings would make people choose the words (and
their battles) carefully.  We wouldn't get 20 postings a day from the same 
person.

Is this a feasible idea?  I don't know enough about Internet newsgroup
software to answer this question.  Can it be made feasible?

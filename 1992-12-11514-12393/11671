   So that explains why it was published in the US, then:

    Author:         Wright, Peter.

    Title:          Spycatcher : the candid autobiography of a senior intelligence
		      officer / Peter Wright.

    Published:      New York, N.Y., U.S.A. : Viking, 1987.

   Having allies seems to be a good way to get secrets out in the open :-)

Yes.  Our Official Secrets Act has absurdities comparable to your
munitions export regulations.  There are many things which the US
government will release under the US FOIA which are Official Secrets
over here.  Sorry, I can't give references -- for obvious reasons.

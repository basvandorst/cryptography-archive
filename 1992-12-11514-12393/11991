In other words, you are not arguing law, which you agree isn't an
issue here, you are arguing morality. Well, morality is a very
personal thing, and most of ours are diametrically opposed to what
yours seems to be in this instance. I think that the people who
created PGP were being PERFECTLY honest, and that it is the law that
says that they were not which is wrong. Certainly, as you acknowledge,
law is not always a good way to evaluate morality. Since we disagree
about a subjective issue, prehaps we could end this discussion right
here and you could leave us alone from here on out, as we aren't going
to listen to you and there isn't much other point in your moral
crusade against the evils of PGP.

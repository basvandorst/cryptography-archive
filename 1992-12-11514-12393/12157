I hate to prolong this thread, but on a new point Vesselin raised, if
the patent or munitions act violation were possession and use of PGP
in the U.S., the restitution is to get rid of it. Posting a key is not
itself a violation but indicative of one, and thus a PGP-signed
cancellation won't cure the violation. It would just worsen it, since
one would have to use PGP to create the revocation certificate.

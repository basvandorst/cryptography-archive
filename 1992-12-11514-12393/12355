I looked at Motorola's encrypting wireless phone at the store -- heard
what "encrypted" voice sounds like -- and could recognize the voice,
so it's not nearly secure enough.  I haven't seen, but have a brochure
for, VTECH's encrypting wireless phone -- with digital transmission
between handset and base.  So I called them up and asked what they use
for encryption.  They refused to tell me....wouldn't even tell me the number
of bits of key for the algorithm.

Does anyone out there know details of VTECH's encryption?  At the
price they're asking ($350), they can afford to do at least 1 round of
DES-CBC, but I'm sure they don't.  If they did, they would have told
me.

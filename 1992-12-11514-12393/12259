Actually, I believe the terms of the license aquired for PGP were such
that so long as PGP itself was publically available that it could be
used for any purpose. The restriction on IDEA is not on the uses of
IDEA or what you are encrypting or for what purpose but on making
money by selling a proprietary product based on it without giving them
a cut.

Someone please correct me if I am wrong.

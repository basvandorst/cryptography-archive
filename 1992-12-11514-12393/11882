Unfortunately, David, this penalizes multi-nationals, who then lose 
the ability to communicate the resulting files to their off-shore 
locations, and need to use TWO versions of the same product to cover 
both domestic or international locations.  They tend to NOT BUY such 
restricted software, so market IS lost.  I know that I will NOT buy 
crippled software, and that is exactly what software that cannot be 
used by my employer WORLDWIDE in ONE version is, in MHO.

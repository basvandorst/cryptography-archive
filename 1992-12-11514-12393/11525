People periodically post articles on pseudo-random number generators
based on congruential random number generators, used either alone or
in various messy combinations.  There's an article called
   "How to Predict Congruential Generators" by Hugo Krawczyk,
in the Journal of Algorithms, Dec 1992, vol 13 # 4, p527ff
about recent work.  I didn't have time to read most of it,
but here's some of the results:

General congruential generators are series of numbers Si, where
	      k
	S  = SUM a  phi(S ... S   ) mod m
	 i   j=1  j      0     i-1

Earlier work by Boyer (several references given and discussed)
showed how to predict linear conguential generators in time 
polynomial in log m, with at most O(log m) errors,
where phi(...) is S     
	           i-j
and also simple quadratics where
	       2
        S = a S   + a S    + a
	 i   1 i-1   2 i-1    3

Krawczyk shows how to make polynomial-time predictions for the general case
when phi is polynomial-time, and efficient predictions when phi is polynomial.

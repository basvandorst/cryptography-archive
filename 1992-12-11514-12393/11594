	                    Call for Papers
			    ---------------

The Thirteenth Annual CRYPTO Conference, sponsored by the International 
Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR), in cooperation with the IEEE 
Computer Society Technical Committee on Security and Privacy, the Computer 
Science Department of the University of California, Santa Barbara, and 
Bell-Northern Research Ltd. (a subsidiary of Northern Telecom) will be held 
on the campus of the University of California, Santa Barbara, on August 22-26, 
1993. Original research papers and technical expository talks are solicited 
on all practical and theoretical aspects of cryptology. It is anticipated 
that some talks may also be presented by special invitation of the Program 
Committee.

-------------------------	
INSTRUCTIONS FOR AUTHORS:  Authors are requested to send 12 COPIES of a 
detailed abstract (not a full paper) by April 26, 1993, to the Program Chair 
at the address given below. A limit of 10 pages of 12pt type (not counting 
the bibliography or the title page) is placed on all submissions. Submissions 
must arrive on time or be postmarked no later than April 21, 1993 and sent 
by airmail in order to receive consideration by the Program Committee. It is 
required that submissions start with a succinct statement of the problem 
addressed, the solution proposed, and its significance to cryptology, 
appropriate for a non-specialist reader. Technical development directed to 
the specialist should follow as needed.

-------------------------	
Abstracts that have been submitted to other conferences that have 
proceedings are NOT eligible for submission to Crypto.

Crypto submissions MUST BE ANONYMOUS. This means that names and affiliations 
of authors should only appear on the title page of the submission; it should 
be possible to remove this page and send the papers to Program Committee 
members. A Latex style file that produces output in this format is available 
by email from the Program Chair.

Authors will be informed of acceptance or rejection in a letter mailed on or 
before June 21, 1993. A compilation of all accepted abstracts will be 
available at the conference in the form of pre-proceedings. Authors of 
accepted abstracts will be allowed to submit revised versions for the 
pre-proceedings. A revised abstract should contain only minor changes and 
corrections to the originally submitted abstract. All revised abstracts must 
be received by the Program Chair by July 16, 1992. THE 10 PAGE LIMIT WILL BE 
STRICTLY ENFORCED FOR THE PRE-PROCEEDINGS.

Complete conference proceedings are expected to be published in 
Springer-Verlag's Lecture Notes in Computer Science series at a later date, 
pending negotiation.

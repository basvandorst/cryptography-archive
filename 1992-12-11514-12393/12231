Uhm, it seem that I am misunderstanding the word "interface"...
Doesn't it mean just the names of the routines provided to the main
program, together with the names and the numbers of their parameters?
If it is so, then the restriction not to change it is very reasonable
- in this way they make sure that the modified RSAREF still stays
compatible with the already written programs... And you can rewrite
anything else, add new functions, speed up the existing ones, etc.
Isn't it so? What does the word "interface" mean in this context?

Still quite a lot - seven...

Well, he doesn't need to get the compression code from PGP... The
compression code in PGP is mainly from Info-ZIP, which is freely
available and not subject to export/import restrictions even in the
USA...

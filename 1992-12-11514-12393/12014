mathew argues as if PGP was some European invention we have a problem
with in the U.S. That's a distortion of the real situation.

Read my lips. PGP1.0 was contraband in the U.S., so much so that the
author pulled out. It was illegally exported.  PGP2.0 was based on it.
Thus the Europeans who use it don't have clean hands, regardless of
the state of the law there.

BEING DISHONEST WITH AN EXPLANATION ISN'T THE SAME AS BEING HONEST.

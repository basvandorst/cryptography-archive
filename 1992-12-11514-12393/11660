I've gotten quite a few suggestions.  Someone suggested I call the public
key D for "distributed," or K for "known."  Not back, but D is the decryption
function and K is a generic key.  Someone suggested I call the private key C
for "confidential," but C is reserved for ciphertext.

There were a few suggestions to go back to the original, and use e for the
public key and d for the private key.  This works, although there will be
some confustion when you encrypt with d to make a digital signature.  I may
go with this and just deal with it.

The most intriguing suggestion was to use the Greek pi for private key, and
P for public key.

That's what I've gotten so far.

Not at all.  I don't give a flying **** where PGP was created or invented. 
It could be written by Martians for all I care.

The point I am making is that whoever wrote it, *you* in the US are the ones
who have a problem with it, and so *you* are the ones to sort out the
problem.

That's utter nonsense.  US law applies in the US and nowhere else.  I am not
a criminal for using PGP in contravention of US patent law, any more than I
am a criminal for blaspheming in contravention of Islamic law.

Your country's laws are your problem, and they do not apply to me unless my
country has agreed to have similar laws.  And it hasn't yet, although you and
your lawyer friends are trying to shove software patents down our throats in
the form of the GATT treaty.

I obtained PGP 2.1 from a site in the UK, who I assume got it from Italy. PGP
does not use any techniques which are patented in the EC.  The copyright and
license say I'm allowed to copy it and use it.  As far as I know there are no
restrictions on exporting encryption software from Italy to the UK, nor on
importing it from Italy to the UK. Therefore I have a perfect right to use,
distribute and advocate PGP.  And it doesn't matter who wrote it or where it
was written.  Another strawman on your part, I think.

Hashing the message before signing it solves the problem.

The important thing to realize here is that there before you use cryptography
to solve a problem, you have to examine the solution from three different ways.
You have to look at the cryptographic algorithm, to make sure it is secure.
You have to look at the cryptosystem, to make sure it is secure.  And finally,
you have to look at the protocol, to make sure IT is secure.  Here is an
example that uses RSA, an excellent algorithm.  It could have excellent key
management and associated stuff.  But ther is a gaping security hole in the
protocol.

Cryptography is a subtle art.

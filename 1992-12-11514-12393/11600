Sorry, you should apply for the nearest re-education center to update
your outdated worldview.  The Public Enemy No. 1 is no longer the
Soviet Union, as it doesn't exist any more and neither does Leningrad.
The Public Enemy No. 1 is the evil conspiracy of child-pornographer
cryptography-kingpins and illicit personal computing addicts you see
an underground anarchist bulletin boards like sci.crypt.

What used to be Leningrad is now St. Petersburgh where people send
email requests to get the freely distributable versions of DES and RSA
or phone to the nearest electronic messaging system to work the market
economy and read scare stories about oppressive countries where Usenet
may not be used commercially and the government demands to spy on
citizens, and which don't let other countries install fiber optic
networks because they are more difficult to spy.

PGP was not stolen. Its GNU copylefted, so there is no reason that
anyone can't modify it as they please. Furthermore, there is no
evidence that the people who modifyed it were the ones who exported
it, so there is no reason to believe that they were involved in a US
crime. Furthermore, RSA is not patented in europe, so there is no
reason to believe that using PGP isn't perfectly legal there.

Looks like you are a crusader without a sword, Mr. Sternlight. PGP 2.0
is as legal in Europe as Microsoft Word. Nothing stolen, nothing
pirated, no patent violations, nothing. Its only a problem for
Americans. You are the one who is falsely wrapping themselves in "the
moral position".

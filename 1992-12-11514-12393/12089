John Kreznar posts another of the several recent messages attempting
to deal with my arguments by imputing motives, or claiming they are
invalid without actually addressing them.

If John wants to be taken seriously, he should address the arguments
directly and show why they are in error, if he can. The rest is noise,
and usually a sign of inability to address the issues.

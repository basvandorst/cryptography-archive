This hits close to home.. but for different reasons.  My ex-wife calls
me and threatens various things, and the only way that I can tape
record the phone call is by talking to her on the cordless and
simultaneously taping the call from my scanner.

But the good news is that I recently loaned my scanner to my son,
who lives at her house..... did I mention that *she* has a cordless
phone too?

Q: Is this really true?  
A: No.  Part 15 devices enjoy this much privacy:

(end privacy)

Besides, if it ever comes up (he has chosen to not mention to her that
he can listen to her phone calls), I think that there are many more
devious people who are listening... she should worry about them, not
this little guy.

I am working on a project in which I am developing C libraries to
encrypt and decrypt data (probably I will use some form of RSA
and make use of public + private keys), and transmit data through
a TCP/IP network on various *nix platforms.  A rudimentary
interface similarto ftp will be used to transfer files over the
network in a secure manner; eg, safe from interception by parties
who "tap" my network line.

Has anyone done something similar?  I am aware that there is some
sort of hardware device that does something similar, but I don't
know anything about it.  If you know of similar projects, please
let me know about them.

I am also looking for references to articles, journals, etc. on
RSA encryption, public/private key systems and key servers, and
network security & encryption.  Any assistance would be appreciated.

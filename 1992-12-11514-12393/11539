I know of nothing to suggest that MD2 has been broken.
Certainly a scan of the latest CRYPTO, EUROCRYPT and forthcoming
AUSCRYPT papers doesn't suggest that MD2 is insecure ... and rsa.com do
not mention any known weaknesses in their literature on MD2, MD4 or MD5
... although I should add that MD5 was developed as a "strengthened"
version of MD4.  The particular
application you are describing is (as you probably know, but others may
not) the Bellcore TimeLink algorithm which
is patented by Haber and Stornetta of Bellcore.  Patents are held in the
USA, Canada, Europe and Japan with other patents pending.
The patents suggest using MD5 as the appropriate message digest
algorithm.  You must also remember that for time-stamping, the message
digest may not need to be as secure as in other situations.  After all,
to defeat the over-all timestamping algorithm, one would need to falsify
a document which not only produced the same message digest but was also
about the same subject matter.

One last thing. For Australian purposes, the "prior-art" issue is
largely irrelevant.  The person entitled to a patent on an invention in
Australia is the person who first files for a patent, not the person who
invents.  This is the reverse of US law where an inventor who can prove
that they invented something first is entitled to the patent.

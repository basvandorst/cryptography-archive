To summarize e-mail responses, I've received several saying that
they had no problem getting large [cashier's, treasurer's] checks,
one reporting the same problem, and two which said there is a
relevant US law.  My guess is that my bank had a policy concerning
this, and that the other banks were simply unwilling to do this
sort of transaction for fear of fraud.

Thanks to Phil Zimmerman for correcting me via e-mail about my
assumption that the MD5 code in PGP needed to be licensed. Apparently,
Phil tells me, RSA put it in the public domain.

Since I have no reason to disbelieve Phil, that means that the use
of the MD5 code, at least, is perfectly legal and ethical.

David

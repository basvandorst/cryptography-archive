You said PKP were "bending over backwards" to help me get free, legal
software to do RSA encryption.  If this is the case, how can I get this
software?

I don't consider PKP's telling me to throw away the perfectly good software I
have and re-write it from scratch to be a very good way of "bending over
backwards to help".

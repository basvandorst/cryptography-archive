Please forgive the lighthearted appearance of this posting.  I 
*remember* (obviously over 40 yrs old) that there used to be a company 
that made a secret decoder ring for a cereal premium for children.  I 
would like to obtain one for a significant young one.  Does anyone have 
any information?  If there is any interest I will be glad to post my 
findings to this group.
Thanks in advance.

Regards,


Gary.

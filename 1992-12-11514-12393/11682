This is nothing new. A 'Lucas Sequence' is nothing more than a disguised
way of doing exponentiation in the twisted sub-group of a finite field
with p^2 elements. This is the sub-group that has order p+1, as opposed to
p-1, which is the group that RSA is based upon.

This has been well known for a long time among number theorists.

While I won't cry 'plagiarism', since the author may be unaware of
prior developments, for him to claim to be the 'inventor' is bogus
at best. It is NOT new.

He should not be able to patent this, since what he has done was all
known before.

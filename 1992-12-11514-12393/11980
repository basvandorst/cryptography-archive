Felix Gallo posts what I read as a sincere and partly moving
message. Unfortunatly, I have difficulty with part of his central
logic, which essentially argues that the law should be what he
thinks it should be, rather than what the elected representatives
of the people made it.

He is, of course, correct that anyone without adequate funds
is in a very weak position to challenge what they think are
unfair laws, unless they can get one of the large number of
public interest law firms (another wonderful thing about
our country), to take their matter.

Given the existence of such firms, though, the situation here
isn't as bad as he fears.

Dunno about the U.K., though, since I haven't lived there since 1962.

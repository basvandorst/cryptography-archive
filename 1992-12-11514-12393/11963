Why do people jump in in the middle without reading the traffic?
As those who have followed even my most recent messages must
know, I'm arguing ethics with respect to PGP outside the U.S.
and Canada etc., and ethics and legality with respect to PGP inside.

Thus legalistic responses about use outside the U.S. etc. are
irrelevant to my position in the matter.

There are plenty of things that are legal but unethical.

Many who defend their use of PGP for reasons of self-interest (we call
that "special pleading" here in the U.S.), would also, in other
contexts support the need to encourage invention, the patent system,
and related matters on the basis of principle, not law. Yet when
it comes to PGP, principle goes out the window and we have nothing
but legalistic arguments.

(I specifically exempt from the above those, with whom I disagree,
whose consistent position is against any invention protection
and who think all software and cryptography ought to be both
universally available and free. I understand that position,
but think it both ethically wrong and practically unrealistic.)

I think the best idea would be to:

1. Vacate and cancel sci.crypt, and, at the same time
2. Create 2 new groups sci.crypt.general and sci.crypt.theory

This keeps both groups at the same level of bifurcation in the hierarchy,
which is much more convenient in terms of setting up newsfeeds and sys files.

Also it forces people to come to an understanding regarding which group
is for what purpose.

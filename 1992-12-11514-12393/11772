I know that pgp files can be identified as pgp files (because, after all,
you can always try to feed it into pgp and see if it asks you for a public
key).  It seems to me that this is a necessary consequence of having a key
managment system, but I don't have the expertise to say for sure.

What I want to know is:  is identifiability a *necessary* feature of a
public key system?  Would it be possible to to devise a public key
encryption program that would, when used to encrypt a message with
someone's private key, emit a series of bytes that would appear to be
essentially random?  If this is possible, then people could just assume
that whenever they received a seemingly random stream of bytes in the
mail, that it was in fact a message that had been encrypted with their
private key.

If this is indeed possible, it seems to me that any attempt to require
private key registration (as Prof. Denning has proposed) would be futile,
because it would be impossible to prove that public key encryption had
been used.

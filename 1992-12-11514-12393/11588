I think you're quoting me a bit out of context here.  In this case, as I
tried to explain in my original post, I believe the information is somewhat
sensitive and it warrants some decent protection, but not so valuable or
sensitive that it's likely to invite, for instance, serious exhaustive
brute force attacks.  Inadvertent revealation of the information would not
be TOO terrible.  We're not talking salary or medical records here, for
instance.  It is precisely a high regard for employee's privacy that made
me consider encryption at all.  This is also an internal application, not
exposed to the whole world.

If it weren't for limitations on the use of DES that preclude world-wide
company use of the technology, that would be the obvious choice.  However,
I can't use DES and I'm looking for an adequate substitute.

Thanks,

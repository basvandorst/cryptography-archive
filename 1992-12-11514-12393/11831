This is exactly a battle being fought by U.S. suppliers of crypto and
security tools. If they cannot export their products, and users of
their products cannot export either, then there are competitive
losses.

Ironically, the market for crypto tools may then develop and flourish
outside the U.S., with some products being "allowed in" to an
increasingly backward U.S. market.

One hope with the widespread deployment of full-strength crypto, as
with the RSA use in Apple, IBM, Lotus, etc. products, is that
pressures will then be applied by these hundreds of thousands of
customers to loosen expert requirements.

Mark is far from "a wimp who does nothing but talk talk talk."  It's 
precisely because he has done more than talk that he has reason to be far 
more cautious than most of the people posting polemics to sci.crypt.  And by 
using RSAREF for RIPEM, he now has the explicit blessing of RSA and PKP (cf. 
article <1992Dec13.025901.2625@msuinfo.cl.msu.edu>).

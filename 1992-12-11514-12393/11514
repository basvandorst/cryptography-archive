The subject of RSA being legal to distribute has seemingly been
beaten to death but I still have a question.

I have an RSA encryption program that I downloaded from a public
bbs long ago.  It is identified as sharewae and for non commercial use
only.  I also have a program called Public Key that uses the RSA alg.
I would like to give these to businesses and small town governments
as an example of the RSA encryption method and encourage them to 
purchase a full blown RSA program.
Both are identified as shareware.
Neither program appears to be from PKP

I would like to give these programs away for FREE with each copy
of a book I am working on.  Is it illegal to do this as long as I 
specify that the programs are only for noncommercial use?
If I can give these away then how about IRIS or PGP.
I am not trying to sell these on shareware disks, the disk is free
and the software is free, I just wanted to give the reader some more
than drab information, give them something to play with.

Summary: Can I distribute any RSA program for free without legal hassels,
I had rather ask here before talking to a lawyer, if I get a no then
there is no need to see a lawyer and the information would likely be
just as valid.

Thanks for any help.

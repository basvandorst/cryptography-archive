In response to Vesselin Bontchev (who unlike many who sound off
here seems to have done some work on PGP2.0 and thus deserves
extra respect):

Since my position is an ethical one, not a legal one, for Vesselin
to say that "what is written in the docs doesn't matter" "you must
PROVE" they copied from a wrongful (PGP1.0) source comes with ill
grace. The docs amount to a confession which, from an ethical
point of view is all that's necessary.

Next he raises the law professor's post. Apparently he has not yet
received and read my extended response. The Professor doesn't have
a leg to stand on, since he argues, in effect:

It is a wrong but they might not get you for it.

Commit a crime and don't worry about it unless the police catch
you.

and similar pinnacles of ethical thinking.

The above is a crude summary of my response--before responding to
the summary, read the response in detail.

David

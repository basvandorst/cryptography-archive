I agree with this statement.  My point is that the States have the *sole*
power to legalize, or ban drugs (the fed's power is, and should be, limited
to those items which are exported to other States).  Their enumerated
power to regulate commerce is:

     "To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the
      several States, and with the Indian Tribes"

They have *NO* enumerated power to regulate commerce *within* a State.

Yes.  All other powers are reserved to the States, or the people.

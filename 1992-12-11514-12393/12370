hi
A friend of mine used ARJ (-vva) to backup his whole HD, and also set a PW (-g)
he cant remember the pw, his hd has crashed, and one of the files contains 
valuable info.
is there any relatively quick method to decrypt it ?
i have progs that does so to old zip encryption, and is pretty quick on the 386dx
have such thing for ARJ ???

p.s. i saw ppl talking about the GWBASIC 'encryption'
i have a tiny com-file that can 'decrypt' the basic files
if anyone needs it, mail me

bye

The ITAR regulations are simply the U.S. instantiation of the COCOM
restrictions on export of sensitive materials.  I believe that all NATO
members, and several other allied nations, are signatories to the COCOM
pact.  Now, it may be that cryptographic software isn't covered under,
say, British regulations, at least when it comes to other COCOM members.
But I dare say that you'd be in just as much trouble if you consciously
shipped PGP to, say, Libya or Iraq as I would.

You're quite correct about RSA not being protected outside of the U.S.
Within the U.S., a patent may be infringed by making, selling, or using
the protected device.

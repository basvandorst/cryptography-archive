Probably not.  Was it not that the reduction in key size for DES from
128- to 56-bits (with redesigned S-boxen) resulted in a stronger cipher
once differential cryptanalysis was taken into account?

Perhaps I remember wrong, I'm no expert.  The U.S. has somewhat
skewed views on these things, but this still isn't France.

Peter Boucher raises the question of self-incrimination if one is forced
to furnish keys to encrypted files.

There's a long legal tradition that not only the police, but in a civil
matter opposing attorneys have the right of discovery. That means that
encrypted or not, if a showing of probable cause is made you can
be forced to give up your papers for examination. In civil matters,
the suit itself is all that's necessary--one doesn't have to
show cause to get discovery, though one might object if the suit
is obviously frivolous.

In neither case is self-incrimination involved.

Thus the issue has nothing to do with cryptography, which in the
particular example only serves to confuse the basic issues.

Well, what do you expect if you go around demanding that the rest of
the world has to jump through hoops because America says so?

It's simply a statement of fact.  I suspect that 99% of public key
encrypted messages outside the US are encrypted using PGP.

Yes, *in the US*.

It wasn't illegal or stolen outside the US.

In the US, yes.  Here, it's perfectly legal.

Yes:  It is interesting that you choose to go off on this "moral high
ground" tangent.  I didn't at any stage claim to be taking any "moral
high ground", so what is your point?

Are you scared to address the point I actually did make?  Here, I'll
remind you of it:

If *you* have a problem with the worldwide standard (PGP) because of
*your* stupid laws, it is up to *you* to do the work to get around that
problem.

Like too many Americans, you assume that the rest of the world exists
for your benefit, and must follow your laws.  Well, I hate to be the
one to break it to you, but that isn't the case.  The legal hassles
concerning PGP are yours and yours only, so *you* can sort 'em out.

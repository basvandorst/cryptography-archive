Not to get off the facinating PGP legality thread but ...


In the Jan'93 issue of Dr. Dobb's Journal there is an interesting
article on LUC public-key encryption. From the article ...

"RSA has dominiated public-key encryption for the last 15 years as research
has failed to turn up a reliable alternative - until the advent of LUC.
Based on the same difficult mathematical problem as RSA, LUC uses the
calculation of Lucas functions instead of exponentiation.

Becasue we're working in the area of mathematics, we can formally prove
that LUC is a true alternative to RSA. Furthermore, we can show that a
cipher based on LUC will be at least as efficient. ..."

Anyway it seems timely. There is a good explanation in "How the Lucas
Alternative Works" within the article and some code.

See the article for further information.

We now return to the catfight ...

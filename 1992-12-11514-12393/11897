Go tell that to Manuel Noriega or the graves of people who happened to
be in the wrong place in Panama at the time US law was applied there,
the crew of the chip recently attacked on by people working for the
U.S. government.

Also, the COCOM regulations are relatively succesful at implementing
the U.S. ideas of what export is legal and what is not in many
countries.  Some years ago a couple of people were charged with
treason in Finland for exporting old VAXen (computers, not vacuum
cleaners) to the Soviet Union, because of the export regulations.
(they were not convicted, though, I think).  I think also that
U.S.-based companies and their daughter companies abroad are required
to use the U.S. government's blacklists of persons and companies whom
not to do business with, again because of the export control.

As for patents - not quite yet, but wait for GATT which has clauses to
explicitly prohibit just about any restrictions on the scope of patent
law.  I'm not sure if there is work for unified patents (a la what
Berne is for copyrights), though.

Followups-To trimmed.

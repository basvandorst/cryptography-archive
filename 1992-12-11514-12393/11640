If the result is gibberish, wouldn't Alice know that something was wrong, and
thus not confirm the receipt of the message? Or perhaps she would send
another message asking for an explanation?

I suppose Eve could claim that the message was the random seed used in their
experiment or some such excuse, but generally speaking the message would have
to make sense.

Tell me what you think. I am interested in attacks on RSA style encryption
too.

A couple of questions, then:

My understanding of US Copyright law is that to be held valid, a copyright
holder must take action against known infringers.  If the holder fails to
do so, the protection of copyright is lost.  Does this hold true for
patents as well?

Using the munitions act to restrict import/export of information not "owned"
by the government seems a clear abridgement of freedom of speech and the
press.  Has the law ever been challenged on these ground?

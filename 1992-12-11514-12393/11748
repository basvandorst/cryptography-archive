In hindsight, I guess this is quite obvious.

A spy with a laptop can travel the country and send messages from anywhere
using PGP and any of a number of dialup data services.

If he had the good taste to use a PowerBook, he would even have a built
in microphone. Just dictate a message and send it anywhere in the world,
securely, in seconds.

If he sticks to PGP, which is in relatively widespread use, what's on his
laptop is much less incriminating than if he had a custom encrypt/decrypt
application.

WOW. I don't envy the FBI. Their job is getting a lot harder. While I don't
agree with their wiretap proposals I can now understand, a little, why they
are so determined to get them.  (Please, no more FBI wiretap discussion here!)

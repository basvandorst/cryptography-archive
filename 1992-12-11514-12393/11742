Try this:

	The right of the people to be secure in cryptographic
	communications shall not be infringed, and no laws shall issue
	forcing the disclosure or registry of cryptographic keys.  Just so 
	no one misunderstands the intent, this is a complete ban on 
	infringement, and shall extend to federal, state, local and all 
	other arms of government.

That might be airtight enough.

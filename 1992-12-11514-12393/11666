  Currently, I'm working on a project, and part of that project is the
ability to encrypt a data file.  Wanting to avoid as much legal hassles as
possible (don't even mention PGP or RSA 8-), I need to know the legal status
of using DES.

  Can I use DES without having to pay royalties/licensing fees, etc, if I
impliment the code myself?  

  And along those lines, is there validation data I can use to see if my
implimentation of DES is 'up to spec'?

  -spc (And on a related note:  Is there any information as to the ORIGINAL
	specification for DES that IBM summited to the NSA that is
	available?  Just asking ... )

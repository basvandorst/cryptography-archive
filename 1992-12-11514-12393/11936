	What you say SHOULD be the case.  However, unfortunately, our
	benighted government doesn't agree with you.  I'm sad to say this
	but my government thinks that its laws can be applied anywhere.
	The Alvarez Machain case proves this.  Dr. Alvarez Machain 
	broke no laws in the US but was kidnapped by thugs in the pay
	of the US DEA (international terrorists by any definition) and 
	brought to the US for trial.  Fortunately, the US courts don't
	always toe the line and they released him.  The outrage of his
	kidnapping remains however and it is a stain on all of us
	that our government thinks that international kidnapping and
	terror is a perfectly acceptable way to accomplish its goals.

	Sadly, many Americans believe this.  I have no doubt that I will
	be flamed for holding the "disloyal" view that my government has
	no right to be kidnapping people in foreign countries to prosecute
	them for alleged crimes committed in foreign countries.

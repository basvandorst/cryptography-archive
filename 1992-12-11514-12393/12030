I'm afraid this is an oversimplification. There are many whom
the government has reason to collect intelligence on who cannot
use secure cryptography with no fear of prosecution.

I sympathize with the desire for honest citizens to have secure
cryptography. I count myself in that number. To believe this
does not, however, mean that one should deny governments'
legitimate interest in this matter, and their taking of
cryptographic violations of munitions laws much more seriously
than the building of airplane models.

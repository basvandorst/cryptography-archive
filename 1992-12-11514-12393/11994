At this point to respond to messages such as John De Armond's would
require repeating points that have already been made. In any case,
I'm not too interested in so doing given his personal remarks.

So I'll say that I've said what needs to be said; the counter-arguments
and my responses are getting very repetitive, and in  the interests
of sparing others as well as net bandwidth I'll rest on what's
been said so far.

Readers should not assume that silence from here on out denotes
assent.

Anyone interested in "and another thing" is welcome to e-mail me--
I do answer my mail.

David

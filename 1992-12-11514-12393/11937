According to RSA's own info, the primes p and q were once recommended
to be "strong" primes (a prime number p is "strong" if there are no
large prime factors of (p-1) and (p+1)), but they claim that recent
advances in factoring techniques have removed the advantages of using
strong primes.  See the most excellent FAQ document, available for
anonymous FTP from rsa.com, for mre details.

This confused me the first dozen times I read it, too.

The idea is not to compute t such that st = (1 mod (p-1)(q-1)).  You
compute t such that st = 1, when taken mod (p-1)(q-1).  That's the
definition of a multiplicative inverse.  The problem in the
description is simply one of unclear terminology.

Erik Oliver sends an interesting message, and one with integrity, in
which he says that keeping PGP on his machine is, for him, a form
of protest.

A couple of comments:

1. I hope it is HIS machine and not a machine he's using. He has no
ethical right to bring down disinterested innocent parties with him,
if he's wrong.

2. Protest isn't much good unless those being protested against know
about it. Otherwise it is a self-indulgent, empty gesture. Judging
from the tone of Erik's post, I know he is not such a person. Thus
I suggest he send a copy of his statement to the Director of Public
Affairs at the NSA, to the Attorney General's office, and to
Jim Bidzos of RSA Data Security (jim@rsa.com).

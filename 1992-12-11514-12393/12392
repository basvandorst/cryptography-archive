I did once see a program posted for the reverse of what was requested.
However it did not produce correct results.  When I looked at the code
it was clear it was not even complete (although complete from the
compiler's point of view).

I would consider cracking VCR+ an interesting and challenging exercise.
I've noted some patterns in the codes in TV Guide and thought I would
give it a try sometime.  I've collected a few issues, including one week
from several areas so I can get a lot of channel diversity.  Some day I
may even get around to it.

In the mean time, I still program my VCRs the old way... I put in the
actual time and channel I want to record.

Nonsense!  The docs do NOT amount to a confession.  Whoever wrote the docs
may have said what they did to associate their program with PGP 1.0's good
popularity even though the two are unrelated in other than function.  This 
sort of thing has been done before with free or public domain programs where
the original author has stopped work on the programs.

BTW, I also think PKP is missing out in a major way by not having David on
their payroll...

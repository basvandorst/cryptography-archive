What encryption algorithm is used in GSM (Groupe Special Mobile)
mobile phones? It is my understanding that some single-key
encryption algorithm is used, where the phone company supplies
both partisipants of the conversation the necessary key.

How secure is this algorithm? And how about the phone companies?

For those of you who are not familiar with GSM, it is a digital
mobile phone system that will cover the whole of Europe. And
no, the algorithm is not an XOR-operation, that much I already
know. BTW, judging by the discussion here a while ago, we won't
be able to sell those phones to the US...;)

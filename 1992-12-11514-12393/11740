It was an interesting attack, and demonstrated that there are stupid
ways to use any technique, but the fundamental weakness was that
the protocol assumed that Alice would sign a document without reading it first.

This is just as stupid in the electronic world as it is in the paper world -
Imagine if the post office used registered-mail receipts like
	Pay Charlie $1000000 from my account, signed ____________

The most you would typically use for an delivery-acknowledgement protocol
would be to sign a checksum (MD5 or whatever) or a document,
or more likely to sign a note saying
	I received message with checksum 765765765 at time 14:37
		signed Alice
which doesn't let your attack work.

I've been reading a number of messages by those outside the U.S.
who claim PGP is legal there.

I'm curious. What are the crypto laws in the U.K., Germany, and
Finland, from which most of the posts come. Is it really true
that PGP is legal there, or do such countries also have laws
about import, posession, or use of cryptographic software,
which have conveniently not been mentioned in this discussion?

Is it, rather, that PGP has not yet come to the attention of the
authorities in those countries? I'm not referring to the patent
laws, but to munitions-type, COCOM, ITAR, or other domestic
crypto and security laws on those countries.

David

Stephen G. * What grounds  do they have  for assuming that  the files in
             question  contain anything  interesting? Did  the disk have
             anything else of interest -- erased files or scratch areas?
             Amazing what some text

      1: He is a repeat offendor
      2: Pedophiles are known to keep diaries
      3: Other than that I don't know.

Stephen G. * In  addition,  there  is  a  cute  little  trick  called  a
             "contempt citation". Basically, they  can throw him in jail
             until he coughs up the key. No time limit. No indictment or
             trial needed. I'm sure they

    The purpose  of the message  was to generate  intelligent discussion
    based  on laws  that will  be written,  with or  without our  input,
    concerning cryptology.  Unfortunately, the only  response I received
    was  either inflammatory  or an  attempt to  be demeaning towards my
    person. Neither of which I need  or care for. Instead of intelligent
    conversation I  get a bunch of  'hate' mail from (to  steal a phrase
    from Rush Limbaugh) environmental whacko's.


Stephen G. * Frankly, it  looks like somebody is  pulling your chain. Or
             you're  pulling  ours.  This  is  identical  to  a strawman
             arguement that has been floating around for several weeks.

    Hopefully  by  now  you  have  taken  the  time  to  read a few more
    messages.  At  the  time  of  my  message  I  did not know that "the
    strawman" argument  as you call  it (which was  a paraphrase of  the
    same  incident) had  also been   posted. As  for someone  pulling my
    chain,  before I  posted the  message I  took the  time to  call the
    person  with whom  I spoke  with online.  (gee... maybe  I'm not  an
    idiot) unlike many of the follow-up posts to me seemed to indicate.


    I  apologize for  my tone....  and I  don't mean  my rantings  to be
    personal to you but, after 30 or 40 messages suggesting that I might
    be niave and  5 or 6 that actually attempted  to discuss the issue I
    have become somewhat disenchanted with  a section of this newsgroup.
    You seemed to have caught me in rare form <G>.


Stephen G. * "Truth is stranger than fiction because fiction has to make
             sense."

    With a tagline like that perhaps  you can understand my concern over
    a very  *real* item. I think  I'll call the officer  if I still have
    his number and see what if anything has happened on the case.

    Either way, the question still remains,  since it is obvious to some
    that laws  will be passed, how would you like it to read?

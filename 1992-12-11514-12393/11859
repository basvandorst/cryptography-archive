If PGP is to become a world standard, given RSAREF, import/export
restrictions, RIPEM, etc., then:

1) Somebody in Europe needs to re-design PGP to use RSAREF, or an equivalent
non-RSA algorithm.

I don't think their are non-RSA PK algorithms on the horizon which are proven.

2) Somebody in Europe needs to reverse engineer the RSAREF functionality.
Given that the whole world has re-implemented RSA itself, this shouldn't
be too big a deal.

So, the US can import PGP without any RSA PK code, and get the RSAREF
from a legitimate source.

Then, us poor subjects of US law can license RSA (large corporations) or use
RSAREF (individuals), and still correspond with a compatible PGP around
the globe. 

This doesn't seem hard, but of course I am not in Europe being charged
with doing the new work.

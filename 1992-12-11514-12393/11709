I just wanted to add that Waterloo is also doing cryptography work in 
the Electrical and Computer Engineering department.  Professor Gord 
Agnew is currently supervising two grad students, Luis Yu and myself.  
Luis is working in the area of block coders and I am pursuing a study 
of secure voice communications.

The department offers a course on computer network security as well as
the requisite background in networks, digital communication and coding
theory.  I would certainly recommend this program to anyone interested
in grad work in cryptography.

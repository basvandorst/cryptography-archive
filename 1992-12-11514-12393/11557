                  Post-Doctoral Fellowship
                   in Computer Security

Applications for a post-doctoral fellowship are invited.
The successful applicant will work on an ARC (Australian
Research Council) funded project for the "design of a public
key cryptosystem secure against chosen ciphertext attacks".
This project is initially funded for one year.

Applicants must hold a PhD or equivalent, and have excellent
knowledge and training in some or all of the following areas:
programming; computer networks; telecommunications; theoretical
computer science; mathematics. A strong research record in
computer science will be advantageous. 

The successful applicant will work in the Centre for Computer
and Communication Security Research.  The Centre was established
in 1988, and has received funds from many governmental
organisations including ARC, Telecom Australia and ATERB.
Currently the Centre has twelve (12) active researchers.
Its research interests cover all theoretical, technical and
social issues of computer and communications security.
The Centre is well equipped with SUN sparc workstations and
Apple Macs, with access to Internet via the campus network.

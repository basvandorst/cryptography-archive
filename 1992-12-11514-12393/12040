Ah, I love anonymous postings.  Umm -- who signed that key?  There's
this about certificates (i.e., about the much-maligned PEM) -- there's
a trail of evidence and authentication.

Quick -- how many people know how to generate a key with an arbitrary
name?  I thought so...

Btw -- the key might be genuine.  But an anonymous posting sure doesn't
give me any reason to think so.

The real punishment is that many are bankrupted by the legal costs.  However,
in the case of Ollie North and other such politically-prominant crazies,
these costs are picked up by legal defense funds, probably tax-deductable
contributions.

This is the only positive aspect of rising legal costs that I can think of.

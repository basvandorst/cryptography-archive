So taxpayers pay for research, if it doesn't amount to anything, they
just lose the money.  If it does amount to anything, they get to pay
twice, once for the research, and then again when someone gets an 
exclusive patent by the University and charges licensing fees.  

If the government gets royalty-free use, then so should the people
who put up the money in the first place, US taxpayers...

BTW-The January issue of Popular Science has an article on encryption
    It states: "The computer industry would like NIST to
    adopt the RSA technology, but that isn't likely to happen.  One
    reason:  If the privately developed technology becomes a standard,
    the government will have to pay royalties for its use."

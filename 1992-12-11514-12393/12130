David keeps repeating and repeating this.  It is simply incorrect to
claim that violating copyrights or patents (and if Bulgaria does not
use such concept there isn't any violation) is "stealing", and to hold
his own ethics as universal is a point view very much disrespective of
different societies and cultures.

Also, even in USA "intellectual property" is a misnomer - go read the
Constitution's rationale behind the patent and copyright laws.  It's
not to respect the "property" of the creator, it's the advancement of society.

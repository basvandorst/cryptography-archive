What impact, if any, does the use of UNICODE characters in the clear text
have on the cypher text for popular algorithms?  Does the use of UNICODE
amount to giving known plane text?  As the use of UNICODE becomes more
widespread does the general level of security provided by these crypto
algorithms decrease?

I would enjoy hearing from anyone who has give these questions some thought
via electtonic mail.
(mail please, I grow tired of the noise on the newsgroup of late)

<raised eyebrow> well, comparing cryptosystems to "nukes" seems a bit far-
fetched, but I do indeed support the right of private citizens to keep and 
bear any type of military hardware.  In simple terms, my answer to your 
question is "The right?  Yes.  The necessary HAZMAT facilities and licenses?  
No."

I'm really *quite* a strong supporter of the second amendment (and the rest 
of the Bill of Rights), and interpret it in quite strong terms (as did, in 
fact, the people who wrote it--read Jefferson's writings).

However, this is getting a little far afield for sci.crypt :)...

I've been watching the bombs go back and forth on PGP vs. Patents and
I would like to post my 0.002$ worth's. But first of all, let's have
a small reality check and confirm that the US _doesn't_ include
Canada - look at the map.

Second of all, it seems to me like alot of people are confusing
ethics and law. Ethics is the code by which you live. It isn't
universal and will never be. There are no "ethics" about PGP, it's a
personal decision, period. Then there's the dreaded law. It's basicly
written by moron's who have no concept of what they are writhing
anyways. Finally, there's justice - an eden where everything is set
"right" for everyone. All three are distinct.

Someone meantionned that PKP/RSA wouldn't sell license for PGP, even
if no actual code, specs, help is given. It seems to me that they
won't even allow for a one way street. More than that, they are
pushing for everyone to switch to another standart. (Not a flame
towards ripem)

I'm really curious about their motives.

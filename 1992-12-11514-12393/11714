Derek Atkins says there are plans in the works to produce a "de novo"
version of PGP using RSAREF, starting with the PGP interface specs.

If that product is to be usable in the U.S., whoever does this is
going to have to import IDEA legally, under the munitions act. Otherwise
one would not be able to decrypt messages sent with the non-U.S. version,
PGP 2.x.

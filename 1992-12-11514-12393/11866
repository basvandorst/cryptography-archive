"Near future"?  I think we're already to the point of fighting for our
Constitutional Rights.  We have the War on Drugs violating most of the
Bill of Rights, and the FBI insisting that fiber optic cables have tees
in them so they can eavesdrop for "lawful warrant, or other purposes"
(I can't think of any "other purposes" that would be "lawful", since
a warrant is required for any legal eavesdropping and wiretaps).  As I
recall, they also want to prohibit the use of encryption in electronic
communications (e-mail, and/or phone), since it would inhibit their
ability to eavesdrop.

Yes, it's pretty obvious...

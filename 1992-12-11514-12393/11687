I have a friend who forgot his password to a WordPerfect file.  I recall
somebody posted a FTP site with a program that could defeat the
'encryption' used.  Could somebody please e-mail me the site & filename?

Failing that, does anyone have any info on the encryption scheme
WordPerfect uses (& I'll try to break it myself...)


Thanks,

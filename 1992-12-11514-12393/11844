Get your facts right:

(1) New Zealand was not part of Europe last time I looked at a map

(2) If you don't live in the USA, US law doesn't apply and so neither
    the ITAR regulations or the RSA patents have any force.

Or are you one of those people who claim that the USA should enforce 
its laws wherever it likes, regardless of other jurisdictions?

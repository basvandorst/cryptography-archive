	All sorts of technology is useable in war.  Calling cryptography
	a "munition" is as stupid as calling boots munitions.  They are both
	necessary for a proper war ;-). Neither directly harms anyone. They
	both can be used to increase the effectiveness of an army. Think 
	of all the lives lost or saved because soldiers had footware.  But 
	don't get me wrong David, I do enjoy reading your jesuitical 
	defenses of the indefensible. It's an art form and you do it very 
	well. ;-)

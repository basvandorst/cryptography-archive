Umm -- there's a legal subtlety here.  Note the phrase ``process patent''.
There are (at least?) two forms of claims that can appear in a patent, a
``method'' claim and a ``process'' claim.  The difference is a bit fuzzy
to me, but if you don't claim a process for doing such-and-such, as well
as, or instead of, the method (which covers the actual apparatus), I don't
think the quoted clause applies.  The question here is whether or not the
RSA patent has process claims.  I don't know, and my copy of the patent is
in my office, which I don't expect to visit till ~Jan 4.

No, I'm not a laywer, though I sometimes seem to play one on the net.
But a patent lawyer did explain to me about process vs. method claims;
if I got it wrong, it's my fault, not his....

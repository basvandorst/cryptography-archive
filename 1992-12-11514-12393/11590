It bothers me to see even us talk about cryptography as if it sprang out of
the head of the military, full grown.

I grant that the military (via the NSA, recently) has funded it well since
after WW-I and that they have kept their results secret, giving them an
advantage over us in cryptanalysis (and therefore in cryptography).

However, cryptography has historically been the property of the people.

Jefferson's crypto device was used, effectively, in WW-II.  That means that
Jefferson, as a private citizen, invented and disseminated what was at that
time unquestionably strong cryptography.

Hebern, in the early part of this century, was a private citizen.  So was
Sherbius. (sp?).  Both of them made crypto machines which were used (after
modification) by the military but offered for sale to the general public.
They were both samples of (at the time) strong cryptography.

Prior to Yardley, this country didn't have any crypto establishment as part
of the government.  In WW-I, the army had to send people to a private
foundation for cryptanalysis instruction (by WFFriedman).

I could probably drag out more instances from history of strong cryptography
coming from the private sector and being offered to the private sector
for its use.

Crypto is clearly, by historical precedent, the property of the people --
of private citizens -- not a private development of Government agencies
like the NSA.  We are not in a position to beg them for permission to use
their technology.  We are the source of the technology.  Perhaps we should
consider whether or not to allow the government to use it. :-)

We weren't really refering to the dope dealers as pirates (or at least
I wasn't suggesting such).  It looks as if the federal Marshalls (outside
of their legal juridiction) have commited an act of piracy...  I think
the US authorities may be required to deal swiftly and permanantly with
the criminals, who flying the flag of the US, committed piracy.

You mean like boarding a ship, and taking the occupants captive without a
legal right to do so...  (not to be construed that I'm fond of drug dealers,
but I dislike the feds exceeding their enumerated powers even more...).

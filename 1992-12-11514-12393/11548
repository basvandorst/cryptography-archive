But, what country did the defendant come from?  Where was the defendant going?

If the defendant was going from Peru to Canada, what business does the US have
convicting them of a nonexistant crime against Americans for drugs not 
destined for American citizens?  With our current hysterical climate, the
guy will get convicted, but we are letting the drug war warp our judgement.
The world is not united on this issue, to say the least.

If you carry guns or currency with you on a ship, that is a crime in many
countries.  If they begin behaving as we do, they can arrest you EVEN IF YOU
ARE NOT GOING THERE and give you heavy jail time.  This is _not_ my idea of
a predictable and just society.  Shall women be arrested on the high seas by
Iranians for not wearing the veil?

There are practical limits of what can really be done in a world that can't
agree on anything, even whether drugs are bad.  If we keep snatching people
from other countries, what goes around comes around and Americans will begin
rotting in, say, Mexico perhaps, for crimes that were not committed on
Mexican soil.  On that day, I don't think we will be amused.  But, we'll
look damn silly saying they shouldn't do it.

We are getting sooo desperate to stop drugs that we are losing our perspective.
Some poor soul is going to pay for it and it probably will be some poor
unlucky private citizen, not the policeman who are acting like pirates.
The constitution is whatever the nine folks on the Court say it is.  But,
a just and sane world society should go back to respecting the freedom of
the seas.  We know what happens when that goes poof.  Lots of innocents get
convicted of phony crimes in countries they never would conceive of entering.

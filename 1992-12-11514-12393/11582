	Of course none of those drugs going to Canada will cross over into the
USA. But wait! If the penalities are less in Canada, why not mass ship the
drugs there then break it up inte smaller batches for shipment to the USA. Less
risk, and you could finance the whole thing by selling some on the way through
Canada.

	I heard it said here, my neighbors risks are not my own so turn and look
the other way. Their kids and drugs are not my job.

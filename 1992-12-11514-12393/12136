Well, there is even one from Bulgaria, implemented by a friend of
mine. But it is by no means comparable with PGP. It uses full RSA to
encrypt the message (instead of using a single-key cypher and use RSA
only to encrypt the keys), so it is horrribly sloowww.... :-) It is
shareware, the author requests $30 for it, but I definitively do not
think that it is worth the price... Anyway, the author has told me
that he as received only one registration... :-)

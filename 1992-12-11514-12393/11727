   I realize that I can use somebody's public key and encrypt a message
   to him, but what if I am say the president of a corporation and
   wish to encrypt a sensitive memo to all managers.  Would I have to
   encrypt the file however times I have managers, each to his or her
   own key, or could I create a "list" of recipients?

PGP 2.0 does not have this functionality (It was one of the first
things I noticed back in September).  In fact, PGP 2.1, which I highly
recommend you pick up, doesn't have it either.  HOWEVER, PGP 2.2
*WILL* have it.  I don't know when 2.2 will be released, however I'm
sure that it will be in that release.  

So, to answer your question, given PGP 2.0 or 2.1, you have the
encrypt the file once for each recipient, instead of creating a single
cryptofile that you can send to everyone.  I hope this answers your
question.

   I'm sorry if this is in the documentation, but I wasn't really able
   to elucidate it.

No, You didn't miss anything.

   Thanks for any help.

No problem!

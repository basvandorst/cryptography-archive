I, too, agree with those who want this group split. I'm mostly replying
to others here, and don't choose the original venues. A reply elsewhere
would seem to miss the audience for the original message, and be at
least somewhat pointless. Basically, I agree (without knowing
this group's original charter) that judging only from the title, this
group ought to be about scientific and technical matters, not law, policy,
licensing, and ethics of crypto.

It seems to me that there has been a very vigorious discussion here
which is crypto-specific, but on law, policy, ethics, etc, and not at
all about science. Perhaps there should be a newsgroup called
"crypto.general" or some such, which doesn't fall in the "sci"
heirarchy.  People mis-posting here can then be directed there.

Since the crypto.general material is so crypto specific, one fears it
will get lost in the noise (no wise remarks, please) of other, for example,
civil liberties discussions if it went to a non-crypto group.

I'm afraid this is incorrect.  There are many "stateless" vessels registered to
no country.  To suggest that you are a pirate just because you aren't flying a
flag is just wrong.  By law, you must display the flag of the country your
vessel is regestered in... but if you are a stateless vessel, you are a
stateless vessel.  Piracy most broadly defined is "any act of violence on
the high seas"

->
"Ships can sail under the flag of only one state and on the high seas are under
the jurisdiction of that state alone.  No ship can change its flag during a
voyage or while in a port of call, except in the ecent of a real transfer
of ownership or a change in registry.

If a vessel sails under the flags of two or more states, using them as
convience dictates, that vessel is treated as a stateless vessel.  This is 
also true for a ship displaying a flag not attributable to a member of the
family of nations.

The mere fact that a vessel has no right to fly a flag or uses an "unknown"
(unattributable) flag does not mean, however, that the ship in question
would be treated as a pirate vessel, unless it had engaged in piratical acts."

This is getting way out of hand.... replies to misc.legal (or whatever)

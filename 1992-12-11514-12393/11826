I agree with Hugh Miller. Indeed, what a bunch of wimps some of you are!
Don't you see...if they divide us they've got us? PGP is strongest in big
numbers!

And even if the number is down to one, the principle is the same! The price
of freedom is sometimes very dear, but, as an American, I am willing to
attempt to preserve the rapidly diminishing set of individual protections
we still have left. PGP is one of the most important tools to assist in
this that has come along in a long time. C'mon people! Show your *heart*...

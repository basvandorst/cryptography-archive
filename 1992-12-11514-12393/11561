	Give me a break.  It's not a constitutional issue, but one of
international law.  But of course we all know that US law supersedes any
international law because we are the biggest armed threat in the world.

	Unless transporting cocaine in international waters is a crime, which
I doubt, the US has no right to arrest the crew of that vessel.

	These people were not necessarily either.  They are not criminals until
they land in a country where cocaine importation is illegal.  There are
a host of countries where mind altering substances illegal in the US are
legal.  Is the US going to go in and conquer every government that doesn't
enforce US laws?

	It is obvious Bohdan, that you have little knowledge of international 
law or what is 'right' or proper.  Our government doesn't have the right
to push its agenda, by force, on other countries and people's against
their will -- despite the fact that they do that here.

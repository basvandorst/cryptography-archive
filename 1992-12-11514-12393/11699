Dear Mr. Lindano:

You mentioned in some posting that you don't necessarily read your
e-mail unless you are notified about it.  I'd like to discuss some
topics with you by e-mail -- not because I fear publicity, but just
because I don't believe anyone would be interested in our discussion,
and it would therefore be wasting bandwidth to post it.
  I'm a mathematician who's somewhat interested in the mathematical
issues behind cryptology, and therefore a reader of this group.  It
doesn't hurt my ego to confess that if your system is anything better
than Vigenere, I won't be able to break it.  Anyhow, I'm convinced that
the cryptologists who haven't accepted your challenge do have a point
which you keep ignoring.  I'd like to try if I can convince you that
this is the case, or if you can convince me that it isn't.  Are you
willing to start that kind of discussion?  Please reply by e-mail.

Yours,
Taneli Huuskonen

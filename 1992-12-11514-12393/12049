What does "violating the Munitions Act" have to do with "ethical
position"?  Or even "infringing on a patent" with "ethical position"?
You seem to be confused about the distinction between law
and ethics.

You seem also to be confused about the difference between "property"
or "property rights" and patents, you talk about "stealing".  Patent
infringement is not stealing, at least according to the philosophy of
the U.S. Constitution.  You might want to read the part where the
limited monopolies are mentioned.

This hardly is an argument about ethics, btw, but rather about the
practicalities.  Analoguous to "No matter if you don't care about it
being unethical to break the law against marriages of people of
different races, you should consider the implications to your possible
government employment."  Not a bad idea per se to consider the
implications, but it hardly makes you very credible when you keep
talking about ethics in the same posting.

Not all people feel the same.  Some people think some or all of
positions that software and algorithm patents are a bad idea, against
the U.S. patent law, and overstepping the mandate of the U.S.
Constitution.  They don't believe MIT/RSADSI/PKP are entitled to
anything.  Even if you acknowledge patent rights on algorithms, it's a
bit hard to argue for the ethics of being "entitled" to something
since the work was done on U.S. government money.

A practical note against this wrt people under U.S. jurisdiction -
such an act might be legally harmful for you.  Also, I personally
recommend against it for the abovementioned reasons.  If you want to
contribute, contribute something to the folks who wrote PGP, or any of
the EFF, FSF, any ftp server / public access system funds, etc.

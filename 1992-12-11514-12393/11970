Tim Moore makes the interesting point that PGP 2.x contains RSADSI code
for the MD5 algorithm. He goes on to say it's licensed to all.

Aha! The smoking gun?

RSA/PKP are not obligated to license to anyone, and may deny or even
withdraw licenses for what they consider to be cause. If they were to
take the position that PGP users are not entitled to a license then
this would be "proof", if any further proof were needed, that PGP2.x
contains illegal code. I believe that even outside the U.S. the use of
someone else's code without permission is at least a copyright
violation in most countries, including many from which PGP defenders
are writing from.

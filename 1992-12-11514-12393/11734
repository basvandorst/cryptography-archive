Does anyone know if Motorola's Digital Voice Protection (DVP) technology
is still considered secure?  I think it came out in the early eighties, and
has been heavily used by law enforcement agencies (including some here in
the Bay Area today).  I've heard rumors that it has been broken, but these
are unsubstantiated.  I also know that Motorola has more recently produced
newer encrypted radios that use DES encryption (presumably in ECB mode to
allow recovery from the occasional corrupt data).

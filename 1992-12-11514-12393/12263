I would like to include a list of primitive polynomials mod 2 in my book.
I have the list from _Numberical_Recipes_, but would like other polynomials
and polynomials of higher degrees.

Does anyone have any lists of primitive polynomials mod 2?  Even if the lists
are short, I would like to compile whatever is out there into a comprehensive
table.

Does anyone have a copy of S.W. Golumb's book:  _Shift_Register_Sequences_?
Are there lists in there?  If so, could someone photocopy the pages for me.
Does anyone have copies of the Zierler and Brillhart articles in _Info._and_
_Control_ (vol 13, p 541-554 and vol 14, p 566-569)?  They are supposed to
have lists or primitive polynomials.

What I really want is primitive polynomials for degrees just less than
multiples of 32 (for easy software implementation):  118-128, 150-160,
182-192, 214-224, and 246-256.

Anyone out there have any ideas?

Bruce

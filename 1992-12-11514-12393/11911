Well, the patent may be invalid, and it may not cover the algorithms uses
in PGP (if it does, it is IMHO too broad), and PKP (the patent holder),
although they claim to license anyone in the US to use it for a nominal
fee, refuse to license Zimmerman or the current updater of PGP.

However, it appears to be illegal to use the program in the US.

You should be able to implement password protection using a one-way
hash function instead of encryption.  The idea is to store a digest (hash
output) of the password.  To verify a password, you hash it and compare the
digests.  This method differs from encryption in that there is no way
to retrieve the password from the digest.  I would recommend the
MD4 or MD5 hash functions, which (as far as I know) are public
domain, freely exportable, and haven't been broken in spite of wide use.

(I'm posting to solicit corrections if I'm in error).

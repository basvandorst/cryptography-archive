Remove the MAY from the above paragraph.  The correct statement is the 
the market IS developed and does flourish, and that the US is losing 
out on market share. Of course, until the rules are changed, and the 
nonsense about crypto is ended in the US, this will continue.

Incidently, the export controls also make it illegal to export 
anti-virus shareware, but NOT illegal to export anti-virus 
shrink-wrapped software sold over the counter (read them carefully to 
find the exemption). Another example of silly rules.  F-PROT or the 
McAfee suite of programs cannot be exported under these rules (F-PROT 
originates in Iceland, so the author does not care about these US 
rules) but CPAV, NAV and Untouchable can be exported. This makes about 
as much sense as the rules re export of Crypto.  Anyway, SCAN and 
CLEAN, etc., by McAfee are exported all over the world (or imported 
at the other end), ignoring the rules.  Take the bull by the horns and 
do the same for all of the Crypto material.

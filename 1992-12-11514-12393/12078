Shaen Bernhardt * It's real  hard for me  to understand why  this hasn't
                  been asked yet:
                                 = = =

  I'm afraid I  don't have the answer for this.  And doubt that we would
  find out either.

  The main reason  for my reply is that my  parents name is Bernhardt as
  well and your last name caught my eye..

  please reply via EMAIL  to jim.wenzel@grapevine.lrk.ar.us I would like
  to compare lineage.

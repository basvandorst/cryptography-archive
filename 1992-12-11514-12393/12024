In US law perhaps, but given the scope of the RSA patent it clearly has no
validity in Europe or any country which bothers to scrutinize patent
applications, even if mathematical patents were allowed in the first place.

If the US gave a patent away on the wheel (a British invention by the way) you
can imaging that people in Euriope would not be too interested in the
difficulties of wheel-less transport.

There is the question of copyright which may indeed have been infringed. However
patents are very different entities.

There are many standards the US does not take part in, if they tolerate a
patents system designed to generate easy money for large corporations rather
than to encourage inovation, that is their look out.

The big question at the moment though is, how does one connect a mail filter to
the VMS MAIL-11 system? presumably I could simply create a dummy mail system aka
IN% and drop the new "signature generator" in there. Has anybody tried this?
Probably a comp.os.vms query... might possibly be overdrawing my quota in that
area though of late...

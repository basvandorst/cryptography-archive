       Despite claims of "hazy" and "vague" wording, the Constitution
is a fairly well written, specific document.  As is evidenced by the way
it has been abused, there is *no* possible way you can write something
that won't be abused, if someone is prepared to twist the wording and the
rest of us let them get away with it.  (So many people are prepared to look
the other way as long as the "new" meaning supports their agenda.)
       It is not the Constitution which is at fault.  You *can't* write one
which wasn't open to abuse, if we let it.
       Beyond which, writing a new Constitution at this point would be a
*bad* idea.  Most of the Bill of Rights wouldn't survive.  And those which
would likely have a "convenient" loophole allowing the government to ignore
them for "pressing need" or somesuch.

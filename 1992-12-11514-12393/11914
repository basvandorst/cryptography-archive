Not quite complete.  (Paraphrasing the comments of another practicing
patent attorney on CompuServe.)  If PGP has a non-infringing use, and the
developers and distributors recommend only that use (in the US), then PKP
would have to go after the end users, or after third parties (such as
myself, actually) who recommend using it, for contributory infringement. 
(This assumes the letter or lawsuit has the purpose of getting legal
damages, as opposed to just making threats.)

Two rather highly respected members of the net have made this claim, so
let's for a moment presume it is true.  If a sympathetic congressman
could be convinced to place the source code into the Congressional Record,
would this not constitute publishing the work, and therefore divorce it
from any ITAR jurisdiction?  Furthermore, I think the congressman would
be immune from prosecution, by constitutional edict, if this indeed would
ever become an issue.

This would not, of course, in any sense address PKP's claim as a patent
holder, but it might lessen the chance of government interdiction.

Comments?

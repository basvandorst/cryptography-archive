Since I haven't seen this mentioned:

   All vessels in international waters should be registered in some 
country and are subject to the laws of that country. The U.S. Coast 
Guard routinely gets permission from other contries to inspect their 
vessels. The vessel must fly the flag of it's country. If the Coast
Guard sails up and says 'hoist a flag', either you do or you are
a pirate. Pirates are fair game for boarding.

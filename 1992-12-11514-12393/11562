      That's wierd.  Cashier's checks are commonly used in business
transactions, with amounts in the millions not that unusual.  
Tellers, though, have a "teller limit" on the size of a transaction
they can handle without higher management approval, and at some banks,
especially at small branches, there may be times when nobody in the office
has enough authority to do a big transaction.  But they may hate to admit
this.

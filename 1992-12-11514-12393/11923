(1) Repeat after me.  There is no such thing as a violation of a patent. 
People can infringe a patent.

(2) It seems the same to me.  You have to remember that PGP itself cannot
infringe on a patent, even in the US.  Only use of it can infringe, and the
use also would have to be in the US.  The question still remains, did PGP
1.0 have code derived from RSA code not appearing in the patent.

(As can PGP).  So it's in violation of ITAR.  (I've seen the license -- all
I NEED is an account at a US site, in order to get it, regardless of where
_I_ am located.)
>  2) The legality of PGP is not being seriously debated.  It's illegal. It
may be in violation of ITAR.  It may be in violation of PKP's patents (a
civil violation, at worst) to use it in the US.  It may have some code
"contaminated" with some RSA code, in violation of copyright and/or trade
secret.  Nothing has been proven.  Here, in the US, we have the concept of
innocent until proven guilty.

The RSAREF license seems to be revokable without cause.  (I did read it,
once.)

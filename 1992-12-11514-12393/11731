Thanks to all those who replied about my problem getting an uncorrupted
version of PGP 2.1.

What I did finally:

 1 got uuencoded file in five parts;
 2 joined them: cat aa ab ac ad ae >pgp.uue;
 3 edited out the mail headers;
 4 uudecode pgp.uue;
 5 downloaded it; (set fil typ bin - Yeah!)
 6 unzipped it.

What I did before:

 2-4 replaced by:
 - edit out headers;
 - cat aa ab ac ad ae | uudecode.

Is this different?  I don't get it.

Perhaps all you old usenet/unix hands are clanking your zimmers and
rattling your cocoa mugs and saying, "He! he! see what he did!".  If so,
I'd like to share the joke.

Thanks again for the prompt responses.

Hi, just wanted to mention a few points.  Someone mentioned 
that PGP was not legal in the US but okay to use elsewhere.

One person even mentioned that using PGP in the US was doing 
wrong against the pantent holders, but implied that doing so
outside the US wasn't.   

My response to these points.  

1) US patent law does NOT extend beyond US borders, right or
wrong, that is international law.  

2) While it is unlawful, technicaly speaking, to use PGP 
outside the US it is still wrongdoing against the patent 
holders, since by using a product that uses their patents 
without paying them for the liscence then they are losing out
on money that they would have gotten if the patents were 
respected.

3) There as been talk about PGP being, or not being a standard,
well, that may or may not be the truth, but it certainly is 
being spread around much.  I believe that the reason for this is
twofold.  a) A very good interface, b) because it is available.

4) There's been talk about RIPEM, about how it is legal to use
it, etc.  One question, if so, why is the distribution being
restricted?  I would like an honest and full answer to that 
one.

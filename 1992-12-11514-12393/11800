spc@pineal.math.fau.edu (Sean 'Captain Napalm' Conner) asks:

  (And on a related note: Is there any information as to the ORIGINAL
  specification for DES that IBM summited to the NSA that is 	available?
  Just asking ... )

To which  uri@watson.ibm.com (Uri Blumental) answers

  Sorry to disappoint you - those "original" specs aren't different from what
  you can get now from ANSI (:-).

Which is not entirely true.  There was a significant controversy over the key
size that would be used.  James Bamford's "Puzzle Palace" (a classic text, but
one that could use an update) has a fairly detailed description of the
wrangling.  I believe the original IBM proposal was for 128 bit keys, but the
final standard ended up with 56 bit keys (that's just off the top of my head;
my copy of Bamford is at home).

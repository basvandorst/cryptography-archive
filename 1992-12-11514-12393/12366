Where it was developed is not relevant to ITAR.  If it performs encipherment, 
it's covered--doesn't matter if it's foreign, domestic, PD or commercial.  
This is the principle manner in which ITAR presents a trade barrier to U.S. 
vendors who are trying to compete in international markets.

The Department of Commerce likes exports.  The Department of State doesn't.
That's the U.S. regulatory system for you.

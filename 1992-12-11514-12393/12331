Fine line?  That's a nonexistent line.  All source code is is a
description-- it doesn't DO anything.  Its not a device.  Now, if you
compile the stuff, there might be some grounds, but how can the source
itself infringe?

Of course, none of this will really be settled until someone makes a
Federal case of it.  Has PKP actually sued anyone, or is bullying and
threats the whole of their style?

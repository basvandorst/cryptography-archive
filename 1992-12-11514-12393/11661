I don't see how one would prove that the gov't "tipped" PKP in case
it happens. How about the following scenario: 

	1) A scapegoat is chosen.
	2) His traffic is monitored and some "cherry" is found
	   (like using PGP :-).
	3) A court order is received for some "chicken-shit" offense.
	4) That offense isn't proven and therefore doesn't stick,
	   but during the "investigation" a case of patent
	   infringement is opened.
	5) PKP sues the pants off the poor individual.
	6) Go to step 1).

Theoretically your're correct. Practically - "might is right". And you
can't even TELL whether your traffic is monitored...

So I wouldn't stake my life/freedom on how strictly FBI/NSA/??? are
observing the regulations supposedly governing them.


Somewhere in PGP docs there's a nice phrase: 
	
	"PGP is guerilla freeware....."

Well, guerillas who announce themselves publicly. don't
live long (physical law :-).

Why does PGP has those ugly lines "----BEGIN PGP...."
and so on? PGP-2.1 is much better than PGP-2.0. Let's
make it really good now -  GET RID OF THOSE BETRAYING
TAGS! NOW!

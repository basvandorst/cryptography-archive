University of Waterloo has some stuff going in crypto; it's not
publicized too much, but:

a) They took a lecture in 1st year algebra to explain RSA.  Some years
ago :-).

b) There's a course in the Combinatorics & Optimization group on
cryptology.  

C&O 437: Cryptography & Communications Security
"Conventional or single key cryptography from the Caesar cipher to the
US DES.  Public or two key cryptography.  Applications include
secrecy/privacy, user or message authentication, financial
transactions security."

I considered taking it, but didn't have space in my schedule.  Dual
majors does that.

c) There's some sort of spin-off company that was advertising about 2
years ago for staff to help design some RSA hardware.  Can't recall
the name :-(.

d) Some stories (possibly Urban Legends, but I faintly remember seeing
something in print) to the effect that some combination of
students/profs. wound up breaking some financial institution's cipher
system.  There was some sort of challenge; the institution claimed it
was "unbreakable," (famous last words of people that are ignorant of
cryptography :-)) and within a couple of weeks, some UWers had hacked
up a way to break it.

Does this actually amount to a REAL PROGRAM in cryptography?  I
haven't the faintest idea.  C&O certainly has a lot in common with the
sorts of mathematics that might be useful to cryptography.

Frankly, I'd be surprised if anyone that DID have a good program would
publicise it very heavily.  They'd risk having too many people getting
interested.  The bits that UW seems to have are about as much
"publicity" as is probably safe.  Would you want organized crime
interested in your university department?  Under certain
circumstances, government agencies could be considered to be a form of
"organized crime" ;-), in addition to Mafioso and the likes.

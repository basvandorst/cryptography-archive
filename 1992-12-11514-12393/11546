I agree with most of what John Gilmore (gnu@hoptoad.uucp) wrote, but I
must quibble at a couple of technical details:

: To develop good cryptography, one must understand good cryptanalysis.
: NSA could not have made DES resistant to differential cryptanalysis
: without understanding differential cryptanalysis in the first place.

According to Don Coppersmith, it wasn't the NSA that made DES
resistant to differential cryptanalysis, it was IBM:

: (Contrast how quickly FEAL and SNEFRU fell to diffcryp, versus how long
: it took to get a theoretical -- not even practical -- advantage over
: DES.)

I don't think that it's right to say that Snefru has fallen to
differential cryptanalysis.  When it was designed, the number of
rounds needed to make it secure was an open question; Biham and Shamir
have provided an answer, at least for one class of attack.

Even FEAL, with a sufficient number of rounds (32), is resistant to
differential cryptanalysis.  This makes it slower in use, but FEAL is
still a bit faster on many machines than DES, even with so many
rounds.

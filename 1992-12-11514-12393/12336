I am not a lawyer -- however, I believe these become subject to the RSA
patent -- and, for that matter, subject to ITAR rules -- only if those
equations and any machinery for computing them are used for communicating a
secret.  (For other claims, you'd have to read the patent and for other
prohibited behavior you'd have to read the ITAR.)  If the way they are used
doesn't help you communicate a secret, I doubt either of these (mutually
antagonistic) entities cares.


It is clear that I am totally free to verify the identity

	x = x^(1+k*phi(N)) mod N

with examples, including the two equations you gave, using any size
numbers, if I'm doing it as a class exercise in a number theory class.

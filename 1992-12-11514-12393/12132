It was the most reasonable interpretation, though I had a hunch it was
not what you meant.

Facts?  What facts?

If it's anti-anything, it's anti-US-gov-actions.  I don't like
governments aiming for totalitarianism especially when they're trying
to impose their worldviews on all of the world and it's a shame to see
so good a constitution being ignored.

You're right that it will probably not be the last time I voice my
opinion on this, but it will be the last time I'm directly commenting
on your articles, as you are now in my killfile.  Your articles -
though they have points once in a while - in general are just too much
noise to make them worthwhile reading.  Perhaps this will help you and
your need to take ad-hominem attacks on me will end.

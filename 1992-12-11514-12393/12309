excerpt from my local pgpnews-file :-)
pgp2.1:
- may specify Key ID instead of User ID by giving 0x<hex> as Userid.
- may keep the signed file in readable form, just adding an ascii-
  armoured signature:  pgp -ast +clearsig=on  <file> <userid>
  (Clearsig may also be set in config.txt)
- with -kvc you may disply a MD5 - hash of your keys, for key verification
  via phone-line ...

so -ast +clearsig=on does the job. I guess the 't' option is not needed.
using -fast instead of -ast and giving your text as stdin lets it work
as pipe. Or at least it should :-}

Friendly greetings,

   No, the purpose was not to start a puzzle league.  I was hoping to
   pentrate what has up to now been an invincible ignorance.  Erik, I've
   had about eight people bother to solve this puzzle, many with no prior
   actual experience with such ciphers.  Most have taken between 1/2 hour
   and 3 hours to do it, largely dependent on prior experience.  Most have
   done it entirely based on the information in the note!  There are many
   different ideas that work; it can even be done with paper, pencil, and
   a hex calculator.  A couple had _never_ solved a cipher before.

I'm one of the people who solved Larry's puzzle, using only squared
paper, writing implements of various colours and a hex-ASCII table.
My rustiness at mental hex arithmetic slowed me down so much that I
took 40 minutes or so to solve it.

Anyway, the point of this posting is: where should such puzzles be
posted for recreation, as opposed to make a point in cryptology?  The
obvious group is rec.puzzles, but no-one over there seems interested,
an observation made both from examining the group for a while and from
private email.  The volume of that group, rehashing the same old stuff
time after time, discourages me further.

Perhaps postings here could be made, subject to a couple of ground
rules.  I suggest:
	1) No monoalphabetic substitutions.
	2) No cipher text more than 1000 characters.

The first is to discourage postings which are too simple, or use too
contorted a vocabulary.  The second is just to keep the costs down.
If you have a puzzle which needs more than this, post a pointer to an
ftp site.

Any other information, such as system in use; probable text; language;
etc.  to be left at the discretion of the poster.

Comments?

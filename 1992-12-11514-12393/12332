Shamir held a talk near Brussels (Belgium) in spring 1992, where he
explained, how to break DES using a chosen plaintext attack.  You have to
make your opponent encrypt 2^47 data blocks, while changing his key at most
every 8192 encryptions.  Then you will break one of these keys with
probability very close to 100%, and you will get the key just after
it has been used, so chances are good, that it is still valid.
 The crucial point is that it is a chosen plaintext attack, thus unlikely
being of any practical value.

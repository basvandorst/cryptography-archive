Oh, but it IS a cryptographic issue.

With a public key system you can be ABSOLUTELY certain that a particular
ciphertext was created with one key if you can decode it with the other.
Therefore, if the keys are not compromised you can, with certainty,
prove whether or not it was written by the individual in question.

sometime ago, i came across a book called, i thing, "Computer ???, Beyond Decoder Rings" written by, again, i think, Karl Anderssen. it included a nice selection of programs for cryptanalysis, quite suitable for the budding amateur. these codes were however written in TRS-80 BASIC.

i'm sure that it would be a worthwhile project for someone to recast these in "c", but i simply don't have the time.

does anyone know of an archive site that might have a selection of such routines or does anyone have there own selection that they would share ? 

if all else fails, i will try to scan the pages in the book containing the programs and see if i can find a unix based BASIC that will run the things.

cheers,

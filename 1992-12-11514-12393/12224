Hi, crypto-men .

I am currently working on a hw/sw project where we need to use some crypto
stuff. My problem is that I dont know which cryptation algoritm to use.
It is very important that the cryptation is HARD (impossible) to crack,
otherwise our whole project is useless.
The following restrictions apply to this project :
1, Each message to encrypt is 10 to 15 bytes.
2, We can only allow about 5.000 assembler instructions to decrypt 
   each message.
3, Some messages will be sent to just one reciever, and be decrypted
   and interpreted in said reciever. Some messages will be sent
  to several (all) units and will be recieved, decrypted and interpreted
   by all these units.
   Thus we must keep the decryption algorithm in 'sync' on all units.
   To make things worse, we MUST also be prepared for that some units
   can be disconnected and thus miss some messages and still work
   (not be out of sync) when the uni9t is turned on again.
4, The chip will probably be built in the US but sold/used in
   europe. So I cant use an algorithm that may not be exported outside
   the US.

If anyone has any suggestions on which algorithm to use I would be 
very glad. If you know what cryptation algorithm to use, please let me
know, and if you also know where to get source and documentation to said
algorithm, GREAT!

Please do not respond by e-mail, my e-mail server is _UNRELIABLE_
at the moment and will probably not start working properly until late january.

I always assumed that the only reason the NSA could have for attempting
to suppress RSA while promoting DES would be that they've got DES
cracked, and they Know the Secret of the S-Boxes.  Recent research seems
to indicate that (1) the key is 56 bits because there's only 56 bits
worth of security in the algorithm anyway, and (2) the NSA S-boxes are
chosen to be more secure.  If they genuinely don't have the scoop on
DES, why should they promote it while suppressing RSA?

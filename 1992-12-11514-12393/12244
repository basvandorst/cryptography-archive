I do not believe that this is totally correct. Some of the standard
patent infringement defenses are latches and estoppel. If you can show
that the patent holder knew about your infringement, didn't
file suit, and you relied upon the failure, you can sometimes beat
an infringement claim. Some have said that all a patent is, is a 
ticket to the courthouse, so if your failure to sue and enforce 
can be held against you (as latches and/or estoppel), then
I would contend that that is a weakening of their patent rights.

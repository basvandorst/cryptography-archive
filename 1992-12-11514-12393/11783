Leaving aside the inflammatory language in "mathew"'s post (I still
can't figure out if that's his last name or what), his message
suggests that violation of the law by using PGP in the U.S. is a
form of civil disobedience analogous to the Black freedom struggle.

First, the analogy is odious; the two issues are not morally
comparable and anyone who cannot see this is in need of advice.

Second, since he writes from the U.K., it's like counseling someone
else to take the law into their own hands with no personal
responsibility-- a kind of let's you and him fight.

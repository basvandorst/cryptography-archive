It was allegedly illegal.  How do you know?  Perhaps an U.S. citizen
memorized the code, travelled out of USA, recited it aloud and someone
happened to overhear it and type the code in.  Or, perhaps ITAR really
talks about exporting cryptic labels on software packages because
someone can use them as munition by throwing them at people, and
everybody just has misunderstood the law.

Gee.  PGP is illegally exported munitions (sorry about the above
paragraph, by your astounding argumentation I now know you really do
know the Truth and are Right), and illegally exported weapons are
often used in wars, thus PGP is built on the blood of many many people
who have died in wars.  Also, as we have read here it has been used
(no, not just allegedly, it _Must_ be true, the Police say so) in a
child abuse case, thus PGP is based on sexual exploitation of
children.  Right?

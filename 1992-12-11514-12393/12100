No, it carries two separate thoughts: 1. PGP cannot be imported legally
since it violates RSA's patents. Patents cover copying, possessing,
or use, and where Vesselin got the idea U.S. patents cover only
use is beyond me.  2. PGP cannot be imported legally since
it violates the Munitions Act/ITAR, which requires a license for
importing, as well as exporting crypto, and PGP contains IDEA.

Next Vesselin claims U.S. users may obtain PGP legally from a number
of U.S. sites, which he lists. He is mistaken. It is on those sites
illegally, for reasons stated just above, and ftping them to other
U.S. sites is just as illegal. It does not matter who did the
importing; possession of illegally imported munitions is illegal.
Maybe in Bulgaria what is physically possible is equivalent to what is
legal, but not in the U.S.

	The only intelligence collection damaged by secure cryptography
	in the hands of citizens is intelligence collection that shouldn't
	be done.  You make it seem as if other governments would be deterred.
	Of course not.  Governments, which are the "legitimate" targets of
	our spies can use secure cryptography with ABSOLUTELY NO FEAR OF
	PROSECUTION.  It is the unfortunate citizens of our incipient
	police state that have to fear prosecution.  The war being conducted
	these days is not against foreign powers but against the citizens.
	Anything that gives the citizen an edge in that war is GOOD.

Patents are presumtively valid. However, this presumption can be, 
and often is overcome. In particular, some of the presumption is
lost if you can show lack of candor with the PTO (failure to disclose
material information to them).

However, note that just because you have successfully defended a
patent, doesn't mean that you are off the hook. A finding of validity
usually has no estoppel value against someone who was not a party to
the previous suit. This means that you have to reprove the validity
each time it is challenged. Lose once though, and the patent is 
invalid thereafter.

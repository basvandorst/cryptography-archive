Can someone explain how encrypted keys, used as protection against
unauthorized use of software, actually work?  I gather that in some
instances expiration dates are embedded in the keys; and that
also the keys succeed in keeping the software off of unauthorized
computers.

I would presume that these techniques could be overcome by a 
reasonably capable programmer and/or electrical engineer and that
they are simply enough of a hindrance that a company cannot get
around them informally and would have to overtly break the contract.

But he's a professor of LAW, not of ethics! And that message from Jim
Bidzos contained legal threats, it didn't just say "hey guys, you are
doing wrong things by unethically using out work, please don't"... I'm
glad that somebody with enough professional experience has clearly
showed that all legal threats from PKP & Co. are completely bogus and
should be ignored.

Fear, Uncertainity and Doubt. Hey, my job is to work with computer
viruses; I am Bulgarian (a former Eastern Bolck country) - just this
alone should make me damn much suspicious to the folks mentioned by
you, so I don't give a dime about what they might think about my usage
of PGP...

I probably have much less experience with lawyers than you, but I
certainly tend to believe a lawyer's oppinion more than yours...
Unless, of course, this is the laywer of the opposite side, that's why
I don't believe PKP's legal threats at all...

I see that he has "converted" you... :-)

Yup, he's doing that since three years... Read the docs of PGP
carefully. He's "thinking" and "considering" and "consulting his
lawyers" and the only thing that comes from this are legal threats.

They don't have petents outside the USA, so there's nothing wrong in
using it...

Ha, I would be happy to pay PKP $20 just for the right to use PGP to
correspond with people in the USA without problems... Note - I am
ready to pay -them- for a program they haven't written and that I have
both the legal and ethical right to use for free. Yet, I am ready to
do that. But naw, they don't want my money, they have even not
bothered to reply to my message...

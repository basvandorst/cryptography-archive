There is no such things about Turbo Pascal either, yet it is a de
facto standard worldwide.

Yes, it does, it is called a "de facto standard". If it is widespread
(and PGP 2.x gets more and more widespread with every day), somebody
will make it an official standard sooner or later. It happend to Unix
and C, so it may happen to PGP too...

Yup. But the original poster was saying that

You see? The main problem is that the USA citizens have problems with
using a widely available good public-key encryption software, it is
-their- problem and it is up to them to do something about it, so they
should stop making noise on the net about it. The universe does not
consist of the USA alone. We have enough problems with -our- stupid
laws and definitively do not want to worry about the stupid laws in
the USA. We do have a good public-key encryption program. It is called
PGP and we will use it. It is perfectly legal to do so here. If you
think that it is not legal for you to use it - too bad for you, but it
is your problem, not ours...

BTW, rumors are that the export-restricted RSAREF is freely available
for download from some BBSes in Bulgaria... :-)

Does anyone out there have a program to remove the encryption from a
Wordperfect 5.1 file?  I have the Bergen and Caelli paper, but was hoping
that someone had implemented it in a program.  Any information regarding
such a program would be greatly appreciated (by myself and my friend's
prof; gotta love those stupid finals week pranks....)

Thanks,

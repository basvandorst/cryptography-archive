 Thank you for the invitation, but I am no cryptologist, nor 
 cryptomancer, nor even an aspiring one!  I have no means to, nor 
 intention of, decrypting your cipher. That's for specialists like 
 you, not for simple members of the general public, like me.
 
 When I first posted here about an encryption program created by my 
 friend, my message was aimed at what looked like a group of 
 specialists whose members I thought seemed very proficient at 
 decrypting crypts. Now you turn around and challenge *me* to decrypt 
 a crypt of yours. I cannot do that!  I'm not a decrypter. 
 *You* are!
 
 Besides, who knows =what= the plaintext says in that cipher of 
 yours...  :-)  
 
 Oh, by the way: I was led to believe by Carl Ellison et al. that 
 this newsgroup was _not_ the place for puzzle-posting ("....but we  
 don't solve puzzles" - C.E.)  Now I see that the principal FAQ 
 producer here is posting puzzles - for me!  Was Carl Ellison wrong? 
 Looks like he was.  This IS a puzzle place, then!  I'm so glad to 
 realize I chose the right newsgroup.

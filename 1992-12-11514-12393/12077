Thanks for the flowers, but no, I have not done any work on PGP 2.0
(except reading the source), so I do not deserve that much extra
respect... :-)

You raised a few legal issues in the message of yours to which I
replied. This explains my reply. If you give up on the legal matter
and raise ethical issues instead, well, I don't want to argue on this
topic. I come from a country that even does not have copyright law on
computer software, so obviously our understandings of ethics are
different... (No, that country is NOT Germany; don't look at my e-mail
address. I am Bulgarian.)

You are not a lawyer, are you? He -is- a lawyer. Therefore I tend to
believe his oppinion, not yours. I wouldn't believe a lawyer's
oppinion on cryptography (unless he happens to be a crypto expert
too), but I do believe his oppinion in legal matters...

Vesselin

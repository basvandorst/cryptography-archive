Miller appears not to have read the RSAREF license agreement, which
has been posted at least twice in the past two days.

It permits speed-up recoding of RSAREF, as well as porting to
other machines. It requires permission to recode to change the
user interface of RSAREF, and says reasonable requests will
be granted.

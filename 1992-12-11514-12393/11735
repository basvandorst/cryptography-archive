Thanks to the many who clarified my understanding of the legalities
of this issue, both publicly and privately.

My latest state of understanding (but I'm open to even more) is that
DES was published. More than that, it's that there's a footnoted
exemption in the Export List (Commerce Dept.? State Dept.?) for
technological exports which have been published in scholarly
journals (the explanation I was given has something to do with
the conflict between the Munitions Act and the First Amendment).

It's also been claimed by one correspondent that a)IDEA has been
published and b)the above footnote exemption would mean that
the IDEA component of PGP wouldn't provide a basis for proceeding
against PGP under the Munitions Act.

Whether PGP as a whole could be construed as different from its
ancestral parts (RSA, IDEA) which have been published and are thus
presumably covered under the exemption footnote is as yet unclear
to me.

Finally, the issue of PGP being a violation of RSA/PKP's patents
remains, though the suggestion of an RSAREF version is certainly
an interesting one.

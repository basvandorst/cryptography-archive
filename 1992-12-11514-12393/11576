See my "temporary, independent FAQ" for a list of books.  No one book does
the job -- the subject, though specialized, is too deep for one treatment
to go from the trivial to the profound.

If you want to keep it to two, I'd suggest H. F. Gaines followed by
Meyer & Matyas' book.  If you're starting from scratch, the latter book
leaves the elementary stuff behind too quickly, in my opinion.  I find
most people need to hone their intuition on the old, well-broken stuff
before they understand the fancy modern stuff.

Even so, you'll still find a lot of it is "rule of thumb" and "your own
ingenuity".  It is very much a "war of specifics" and there isn't a lot of
general stuff that's very useful without your adapting it to the case
at hand.

As to university stuff, I leave that to others.  Is there anything?  I
imagine some Universities (Purdue?) might have a course or two on
cryptography in association with Data Security, but I don't know offhand
of any "U" that has a strong crypto deparment.  Can someone correct me?

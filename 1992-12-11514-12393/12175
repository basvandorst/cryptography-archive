I hope this is not a FAQ, but if so, please direct me accordingly, thanks.

Would multiple encryptions add to the level of security of, say, a PK system
like RSA or a knapsack scheme?  What I mean is to encrypt the clear text and
then encrypt the encrypted text, probably with a different key.  If encryption
of binary poses a problem, one could, say, uuencode the encrypted text.  This
could, in theory, provide an arbitrary number of successive encryptions which
would, as far as I can see (which ain't saying much anymore :)) effectively
offer the equivalent of encryption with very large keys (say, >10000 digits).

Would this work?  Would there be any difficulty in decryption?  It seems to 
me you could mutate the clear text with basically no limit, beyond, perhaps
eventually winding up with the clear text again.  Anyone have any thoughts on
this?

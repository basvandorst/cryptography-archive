The call for the creation of a (possibly) moderated sci.crypt.research
group seems to have stirred a real hornets' nest. And this is during
the Crhistmas break - I wonder what will happen when everybody returns
from their vacations?

Anyway, I have the feeling that _one_ reason this has caused so much
hot feelings is that people are afraid of being censored.

I know that _some_ people are in favour of making sci.crypt moderated,
and, yes, that would be some sort of censorship.

_BUT_

these people seem to be in a very small minority.

The actual proposition is something completely different: 

to create a *new* group for technical/scientific discussions about
cryptography, and to leave sci.crypt _as it is_.

Please note that this will not censor anyone. Sci.crypt will stay as it
is, and the discussion can continue just as before.

It's not even about building ivory towers, as somebody insinuated.
Even if a new group is moderated, and the moderator refuses to post
anything but technical articles, there'll still be sci.crypt, and most
of the "researchers" will probably still read it. If they don't want
to read it - well, they can unsubscribe even today, can't they, and
take their traffic to email. IMHO it's better to have the people who
can't cope with the volume of sci.crypt posting to a separate
newsgroup than to lose them altogether.

So there's no need to be so upset about things. If the new group is
created, and you don't like it, you can just go on posting to
sci.crypt. 

NOTE: I am *not* involved in any way with the proposal to create
sci.cryt.research (or whatever it should be called). The only thing
I've done is to express my support for the idea.

I have *no* interest in censoring anyone. In fact, I could manage
without the new group (but it would sure be more convenient if the
traffic would be sorted into different channels according to topic).

It is incorrect to say that according to PKP it is o.k. to use
PGP for personal use. Please provide a source for this statement.

You came in after the movie ended. PKP has a patent on work done
only partly with public funds. The agreement with the government
provided for free use by the government, and for patentablility,
and for exploitation by the patent holders for non-government
use. This is a very common arrangement that gave us the
digital computer and many other inventions.

Without such arrangements, many of the brightest people would
devote their attentions elsewhere, with concomitant impoverishment
of the invention base, particularly in areas of interest to
the government, such as computers, electronic technology, etc.

This has been discussed at great length in the relevant newsgroups,
over the past month or so.

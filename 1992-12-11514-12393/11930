Presumably this would be covered by the Merkle/Hellman patent.  But
would the fact that this is, I gather, isomorphic to RSA cause it to
be covered by the R/S/A patent as well?  Math patents raise tricky
questions.  If a reasonable argument could be made both that it is
"obvious to one versed..." and that it is not directly covered by the
R/S/A claims (I don't think you can control derivatives of your
patent's claims), it could be useful.

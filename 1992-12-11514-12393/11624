Roy Blaak asks if the message in Schneier's description of the attack,
being gibberish, won't make Alice suspicious. It might, but if the
message confirmation process is automatic, it will be too late. The
conclusion is that it's a bad idea to confirm messages in this way,
since it will allow anyone to read any message they intercept via
this kind of spoofing.

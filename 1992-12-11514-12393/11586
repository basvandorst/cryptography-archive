I have been following the security related groups for a while trying
to understand all the discussion going on about the Legality of
Crypto Tecniques, and I haven't been able to understand the following:

 (1) Is feeding public data or telephone networks with crypted data
     illegal or those who posted articles on the subject were just
     wishing it were made illegal ???

 (2) Is it illegal to crypt any form of communication (like regular
     mail) or, as above, people are just wishing it were ?

 (3) Are there any signs that legislators are going or will regulate
     the subject in the near or mid-term future.

All the above questions are for the USA and Canada. On my part I did read
carefully my contract with the Italian Phone COmpany and I haven't
been able to find any clause specifying I cannot crypt my voice or data ...

Post or e-mail your replies ...

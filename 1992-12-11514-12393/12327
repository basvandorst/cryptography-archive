A moderated mailing list might be more appropriate for specialized
cryptographers... (in which case, a CFV for a new newsgroup might be
superfluous) Are there enough people capable of doing actual crytpo
work to provide sufficient traffic for a sci.crypt.research
newsgroup?

I have no strong interest either way, my interest is as a user,
not as a person capable of writing bulletproof cryptographic algorithms
or software, I'm merely interested in using a reliable product.

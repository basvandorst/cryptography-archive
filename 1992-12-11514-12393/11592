	With loadable libraries this becomes almost too trivial.  You
	build an interface to the encryption algorithm, sell the software
	with a dummy loadable encryption library (one that the NSA 
	can't complain about) and give instructions on how to replace the 
	library with your own.  Then all that pirate DES and RSA code 
	floating around Kiev and Leningrad can be put to good use. ;-)
	But more pleasing than putting food in the mouthes of out-of-work 
	russian software engineers is the possibility of watching the
	NSA and the national security state simmer in its own juices.
	They have done enough damage to our nation already.

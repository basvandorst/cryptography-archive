Does anyone (the law, the regulations, a court case?) define "software" to
specifically include source code?  If not, one could make a good case that
well-documented source code more closely resembles "technical data" than
"software".  (Even if so, as you point out later, the law/regulations are
absurd, but, if not, there is no need to go further...the law doesn't apply
to the source code of a cryptographic program.)

For that matter, have there been any court cases related to ITAR and
software.

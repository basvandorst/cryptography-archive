I was asked to supply information re export control over anti-virus 
software, since I stated it was restricted in some cases.

The exact information follows:

Source: A Guide to Canada's Export Controls, January 1, 1992

Page 25, item 1150.Information Security

NOTE: The embargo status of "information security" equipment, 
"software", systems, application specific "assemblies", modules, 
intergrated circuits, components or functions is defined in this 
Category even if they are components or "assemblies" or other 
equipment.


Page 25, item 1154. Software

1154.a.c.3. "Software" designed or modified to protect against 
malicious computer damage, e.g., viruses.


Page 1, General "Software: Note

This List does not embargo "software" which is either:
1. Generally available to the public by being:
    a. sold from stock at retail selling points, without restriction,
       by means of:
        1. Over the counter transactions
        2. Mail order transactions
        3. Telephone call transactions _AND_
    b. Designed for installation by the user without further 
       substantial support by the supplier, _OR_
2. "In the public domain".

A check with Ottawa resulted in the statement that F-PROT was export 
restricted (controlled) as shareware did not meet the criteria of this 
general "software" note... Therefore SCAN by McAfee also would not 
meet the requirements.

I believe a similar restriction will be found in the US regs, as 
Canada's are based in good measure on the US regs, and this specific 
restriction was added at the request of the US gov't.

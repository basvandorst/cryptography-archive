	I was wondering if anyone knows the algorithm used in arj for
the encryption scheme.  It appears to XOR the compressed text with some
permutation of the password string (I suspect this is XOR'd with something
else as well).  If anyone knows, please email and I'll summarize, otherwise
I'll just figure it out myself.

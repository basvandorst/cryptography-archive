(1>) Do you have any basis for your premise that a computer program CAN
infringe a patent?  My understanding of the law (confirmed by some experts)
is that, as we don't have algorithm patents in this program, a computer
program alone cannot be covered by a patent.  The program must be RUNNING
on a computer before there is any infringement.

(2>) We've gone through this.  I haven't tracked the exception to the
exception to the exceptions in the regulations, but it is unclear whether
"public domain" (meaning essentially, published) crypto software is covered
by ITAR.

See (1>) above re patents.

Re ITAR, see (2>) above.  In addition, it is not clear to me that
possession of illegally imported "munitions" IS illegal.  It may be, but
the law is sufficiently unclear that it might not be.

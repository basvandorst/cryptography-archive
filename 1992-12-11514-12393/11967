Arthur Rubin claims anyone from a U.S. site can get ripem from the
server. He is wrong. Not everything that can be found with archie
can be accessed or downloaded.

When ripem is released, one can be sure that the formal process
for getting a copy will be consistent with ITAR and the Munitions
Laws.

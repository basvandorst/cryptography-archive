   My latest state of understanding (but I'm open to even more) is that
   DES was published. More than that, it's that there's a footnoted
   exemption in the Export List (Commerce Dept.? State Dept.?) for
   technological exports which have been published in scholarly
   journals (the explanation I was given has something to do with
   the conflict between the Munitions Act and the First Amendment).

   It's also been claimed by one correspondent that a)IDEA has been
   published and b)the above footnote exemption would mean that
   the IDEA component of PGP wouldn't provide a basis for proceeding
   against PGP under the Munitions Act.

If I'm the correcpondent you mean, I *didn't* say that the IDEA
component of PGP wouldn't provide a basis for government action against it -
I said there's a difference between algorithms 
(which the government doesn't seem to currently class as munitions)
and *implementations* of algorithms (which unfortunately they do),
and that if we wanted a legal-for-use-in-USA version of PGP,
we could use the IDEA algorithm but we'd have to implement it here.
(And, of course, we'd have to find out if the Swiss patent owners
have a patent in the US or would be nice enough to let us use it free.)


.... so we'll need to find a paper journal article, or have it posted
in alt.journals.scholarly.obscure from some site in Finland .... :-)

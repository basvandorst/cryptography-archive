I would too be extremely interested. I've started writing up a small 
introduction to cryptography (well more so computer encryption) but 
seeing as I don't have the strong mathametical background, or full 
theories/examples, its all just non-specific, but covers what everything 
is. 

I'd also like true books, or texts that I can refernce to. Reading the 
FAQ might be good too.

Vesselin Bontchev asks why I don't revoke my key. The reason is because
now that I understand the legal position I won't use PGP. To revoke
my key en clair would be insecure and many have argued about the
dangers of spoofing.

Besides, the key does no harm out there. Those who wish to delete it
are certainly free so to do. I see no reason why someone would
send me a PGP message, and if they were so to do, I could easily
ask them to retransmit it in clear.

I can't help feeling that Vesselin isn't really serious in his request,
but has his tongue in his cheek. If he IS serious, then he's attempting
to induce me to use PGP illegally, and I won't.

By the way, in a previous message, Vesselin argues that he comes from
a country (Bulgaria) without patent (or was it copyright) protections,
as if that is an argument that should carry weight.

Hardly. In the former Soviet Union many crimes were committed which
were not illegal, as, I warrant, in Bulgaria. That doesn't make them
right. I suggest that if present-day Bulgaria wishes to gain the benefits
of membership in the international economic community, or the EEC, it
will have to bring its intellectual property laws in line, and until
then, many of its actions constitute stealing according to international
norms, even if not under the laws of Bulgaria.

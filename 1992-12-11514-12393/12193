But as my post has pointed out, it is rather unlikely given US Civil
law that anyone could recover legal fees as they are not routinely
awarded to the winner. Dan Quayle's Council on Competitiveness felt
that this was the reason lawsuits occur so much more often in the US
and wanted statutory reform that would change our system to follow the
U.K. rule under which fees are awarded.

I may be wrong about this, but I seriously doubt it.

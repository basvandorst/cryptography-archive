There would be no legal or Munitions Act problems, as far as I can see
(in response to a message of Vesselin's), in writing a "new" PGP
in the U.S., from scratch, incorporating RSAREF. It could be written
to be file and message compatible with the version in Europe that
takes RSA's invention without compensation.

There would be certain restrictions, however. It could not be exported,
could only be used for private, non-commercial use, and if it used
IDEA, there would be certain questions that would have to be answered
about the Munitions Act--namely whether IDEA could be imported into
the U.S., say, as an algorithm rather than code, and whether the Swiss
owners of IDEA would be as happy with its inclusion in the U.S. version
as the European version.

Alternatively, the U.S. version could use DES and the European version
reprogrammed to use the a from-scratch programmed DES based on the
public description. (Using a version of DES code illegally exported
from the U.S. would not count).

The only other question is whether PKP/RSA would license RSAREF for
such a U.S. PGP. Though they have done so for ripem, they are not
obligated to do so for anything else. if they did, however, note
that the license allows for RSAREF modifications by the user,
so it could be tailored to PGP's needs.

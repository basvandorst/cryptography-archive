If you are speaking from the legal point of view, you must first
-prove- that PGP 2.0 is based on an illegally exported copy of PGP
1.0. I claim that it is not - it even cannot use the keyrings of PGP
1.0. It is a completely different product, developped independently
outside the USA, not exported illegally, and not based on any "stollen
goods". What is written in the docs simply doesn't matter; from the
legal point of view, you must -prove- your accusations.

Again, speaking about the legal point of view, there was a very nice
message from a law professor in sci.crypt, who clearly showed that all
those claims of PKP that they might sue the users of PGP are
completely bogus and anybody who is scared by them suffers of
paranoia...

I hope.

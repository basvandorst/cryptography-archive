While you're listing the politically motivated uses of the export control
system, don't forget to include Bush's approval of the F-15 and F-16 sales
to Saudi Arabia and Taiwan. They just happened to occur while he was
running for re-election, and were announced during campaign stops to
the companies that make them.

You fail to understand the true purpose of export controls. It's not
to keep dangerous weapons out of the hands of third world dictators.
No, the real purpose is to give a sitting president a way to buy votes
without having to use tax money (although he also exercised *that*
option, as in Florida and Louisiana.)

When you begin to analyze the export controls in the light of the
executive branch amassing as much political and economic power as it
possibly can, they start to make a lot more sense. They certainly
don't make much sense if you only look at their stated purpose.

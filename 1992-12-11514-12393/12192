I was ftp'ing some stuff from gatekeeper.decwrl.com, and saw an
interesting motd.ftp file:

     EXPORT CONTROL NOTE: Non-U.S. ftp users are required by law to follow U.S.
     export control restrictions, which means that if you see some DES or
     otherwise controlled software here, you should not grab it.  Look at
     00README.export-control (in every directory, more or less) to learn more.
     (If your the treaty between your country and the United States did not
     require you to respect U.S. export control restrictions, then you would
     not have Internet connectivity to this host.  Check with your U.S. embassy
     if you want to verify this.)

Since there's no U.S. embassy in New Jersey, I'll have to let someone else
check it out...

There have been a few anti-American distortions of my post that I need
to correct, in which people, in response to my comments about crypto
saving lives in WWII have said, "What about the Japanese dead?"  Some
have even attempted privately to accuse me of racism, but when
challenged have failed to support such nonsense.

Leaving aside that the Purple decrypts allowed the U.S. forces to
defend against Japanese ATTACKS, as in the Pacific Naval battles (so
the Japanese dead belong on the head of the Japanese, not the U.S,.
military), I also cited Enigma, which saved many British and other
non-U.S. lives.

It seems that some like to bash the U.S. (including some Americans)
at every opportunity, but please, it's really off the subject
of whether crypto has saved lives in wartime. The evidence seems
incontrovertible to me. 

And let's recall that the question of whether it has is really about
whether the government thinks it has. And let's recall that the
question of whether the government thinks it has is offered as an
explanation for why the government takes crypto more seriously than
the dimensions of a model airplane (which is what started this entire
subthread).

So getting back to the origin of this entire mini-tempest side
discussion, all the arguments above were sophistries attempting to
refute the obvious--that the government takes crypto more seriously
than the dimensions of model airplanes, which was my original point in
response to a question.

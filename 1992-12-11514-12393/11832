Well... it's not like I would necessarily be using it for work-related
uses, except maybe for protecting company proprietary data.  I was more
interested in crypt programs for protecting PERSONAL privacy (on my OWN
equipment).

Thank you for clearing this up.  Someone else on the net (I believe it
was David Sternlight) also mentioned this to me a while back, but since
so many recent posts recommended switching to RIPEM, it seemed to me
(and many others, I guess) that the program was now widely available.

I agree.  For those of us without access to RIPEM, it's quite frustrating
to be told we should switch to a program we can't even get our hands on
yet, and away from a program that works now (even though the legality of
use is still being debated).

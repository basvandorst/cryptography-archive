That is precisely the reason why I oppose the PEM RFCs.  There is no
way that a worldwide software distribution can be created that uses
RSAREF, without it violating export laws.

And how good is an Internet standard if it's US-centric?  The Internet
consists of more than the US.

Please RSADSI and PKP, consider that, too.  You might force all US
netters to use RIPEM, but the rest of the world will probably use PGP.

Have fun.

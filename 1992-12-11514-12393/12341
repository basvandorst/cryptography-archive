Could someone who knows how to create groups create talk.crypt so that
we can remove this load from sci.crypt?

I just returned from a 1 week vacation and am going through 300+ postings
-- and have seen the same 2 or 3 opinions stated over and over and over
again.

Once is enough per opinion -- unless it's a talk.* group -- at least IMNSHO.

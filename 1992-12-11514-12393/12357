I tried to keep quiet to get back to sci.crypt, but...

You are (a) confused on the laws, and (b) confusing patents, copyrights,
and trade secrets.

1. Publishing something NEVER places it into the public domain UNLESS
you publish is with a statement to that effect.

2. Various country's patent laws have different restrictions on when
and how you must apply for a patent.  For example, in the U.S., you can
publish something before applying for the patent -- but the clock
starts ticking to when you must file or it's too late.  In other countries,
if you publish before filing, you lose -- you can not file after that time.

3. Copyrights are VERY different from patents.  Too much to say here
except that basically patents protect the idea while copyrights protect
the expression of the idea but not the idea itself.

4. The Datapoint case mixes employment contracts, trade secrets, and
copyrights -- but we were talking about the RSA *patent*.

I suggest that you obtain a better understanding of intellectual
property issues.

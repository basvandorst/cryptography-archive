As most of you already know, I am in the middle of writing a cryptography
book for programmers.  It will be published by John Wiley & Sons sometime
in the Fall.

Some time ago I asked this newsgroup if there was anyone interested in
reading and commenting on the manuscript.  A number of people have said yes,
and I saved all of those responses.

The time has come to see which of those responses were serious.  By the end
of the week I will have finished my draft of the first main section of the
manuscript:  cryptographic protocols.  I am planning to E-Mail that section
and the introductory section to everyone who expressed interest last time,
and anyone who expresses interest now.

All comments, criticisms, additions, and complaints are welcome. 

Additionally, I am still looking for cryptography source code for inclusion
in the book and on the source code disk.  I am interested in C source for
N-Hash, SHA, DSS, and anything else you can think of.  I have code for DES,
Lucifer, MD4, MD5, LOKI91, REDOC-III (I think), Snefru, Khufu and Khafre (if
I can transfer it from the patent), RSA (I'm using RSAREF), and IDEA.  I am
also looking or code for pre-computer algorithms.

Anyway, if you have already responded to this request the last time it was
posted, you don't have to respond again.  I am hopeful that this book will
go a long way to bring cryptography out of academia and into the hands of
programmers.  Any help that would make this book better would be greatly
appreciated.

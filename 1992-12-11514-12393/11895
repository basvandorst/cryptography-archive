It seems to exist and work well here.  Perhaps it would help to
getting an alternate feed to cover for malfunctions or lack of
coverage of groups on the primary feed.

I don't know exactly what "the European backbone" is when talking
about Usenet (perhaps something to do with a company/organization
called EUNET?), but some hosts which might have something to do with
it via which a message in alt.security.pgp has passed are "mcsun",
"fuug" and "Germany.EU.net".

Hmm, also, perhaps your problem might have something to do with the
generic Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt about in some countries with
somewhat more less-than-perfect freedom with regards to cryptography
than most - I don't see the host "uunet" in the Path field of any of
the message which are only in alt.security.pgp.  Then again perhaps
not, it may just be the fact of Usenet that not all sites take alt
groups and thus the propagation is not always good.

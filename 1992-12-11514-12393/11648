    Thanks, Mr. Z.  This is an _outstanding_ update to an already great
piece of software.  I've been playing with it since I got it yesterday,
and I absolutely _love_ the enhancements.

    My _favorite_ enhancement!  This is something we've all wanted,
and its implementation is superb.  Just set up a 4DOS alias (or, if
you're still using COMMAND.COM, an analgous batch file) that reads
                  pgpc = `pgp -sta +clearsig=on`
and 'pgpc filename' will generate a signed cleartext message!  This is
the PGP we've all been waiting for!

    That's the truth!  Alas, though, they've even smoothed out the one
rough edge with which I scratched my itch for even _better_ security.
PGP 2.0 had allowed me to generate public/private key pair with up to
1136 bits; the 2.1 incarnation _draws_the_line_ at 1024 bits ("military
grade").  Thankfully, it still accepts my 1136-bit key with grace.
    So, if you're using a >1024-bit key, or plan to change to one, be
sure you keep a copy of your PGP 2.0 executable, to use for generating
1025- to 1136-bit keys after you upgrade to 2.1.

    OOPS!  Forget everything I said!  I was never here! ;-)

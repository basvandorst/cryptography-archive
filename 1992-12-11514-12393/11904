Whoever goes to court to test the patent claim had better darn well have
the resources and circumstances to mount a strong defense or else he'll
just get creamed and a precedent will be set in favor of PKP.  It's not
something for some random doofus to challenge without significant
backing and knowledge.  Making a frivolous violation and losing in court
does not help your cause; quite the contrary.

That was part of why Mark Riordan quietly withdrew RPEM when it was
challenged even though he didn't believe it infringed PKP's patent.  I
suppose you think him a wimp who does nothing but "talk talk talk"
because of that, but it may have been the right decision for the time.

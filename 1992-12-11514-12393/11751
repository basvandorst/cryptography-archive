It's important for a spy to not be obvious. A custom crypto program is more
obvious than one in "widespread" use. Mailing to boris@kremvax.Xussr is more
obvious than posting GIFs (as someone else suggested). You didn't comment on
this aspect. For a fictitious example, The Cardinal of the Kremlin disguised
his messages as diary entries. That way he could plausibly deny that they
were anything more than diary entries.

We (readers of sci.crypt) have a belief that PGP is secure because we believe
that very large numbers are "impossible" to factor, and that IDEA is difficult
to break given frequent key changes. Perhaps the NSA and its counterparts have
reached the same conclusions. In that case, it would be quite reasonable to
have lower level spies (perhaps only industrial ones as you suggest) use PGP.

I'm not really a student of bureaucracy but I'll suggest that Not Invented
Here would be a bigger obstacle keeping an agency from adopting PGP than any
weaknesses in it. There is a general consensus that real spooks disparage the
use of factoring based cryptosystems, but perhaps *that* is disinformation.

It's my name.

No, not at all.  You made a general statement that you did not support the
breaking of laws as a means towards getting rid of those laws.  I merely
mentioned the struggle for black freedom to show up how odious such a
position is.

I did not at any time state or imply that the struggle for black freedom was
analogous to the struggle for public key cryptosystems.  Take your strawman
elsewhere.

Since I believe the UK has laws prohibiting the sending of encrypted messages
over telephone lines, every time I use PGP I am risking arrest.

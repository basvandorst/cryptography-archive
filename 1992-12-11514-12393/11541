No, unfortunately, I don't know the country of registry.  But I may be
able to find out late this afternoon.  I'll try to stay abreast of this,
and if I hear any more, I'll let you know.  If you have a fax machine, I
might be able to send you a multi-page copy of the motion to dismiss
that was filed in federal court.  Will probably take me a few days to
get around to that, though.

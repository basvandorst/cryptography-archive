I started up rn today with the intention of unsubscribing to sci.crypt
because of the transmogrification of the newsgroup into a legal/political
forum instead of an academic one. I'm very glad therefore to see this RFD for
a new group. As for whether the practitioners should move to a new group
(sci.crypt.research) or the lawyers/politicians should get a new group
(talk.crypt), I don't have a strong preference. However, I would point out
that having the word "research" in the group name would be a stronger hint
as to the group's purpose than trying to infer the respective group agendas
based solely on the prefixes "sci" and "talk." But then again, USENET has
a large readership of UNIX users that are quite at home with terse word
fragments. Wdnt u agre? :)

If the two group names don't provide enough guidance to would-be posters,
then moderating the academic newsgroup might be necessary. Or would a weekly
"Welcome to sci.crypt[.research]" posting be enough to alert readers to the
respective group charters? I welcome responses from people with actual
anecdotal evidence.

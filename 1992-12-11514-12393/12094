I fail to understand how someone who constantly harps on ethics could possibly
have written the above message and expect anyone to pay attention to him.  Rude
name calling is never ethical.  And ethical behavior has consistency as a firm
basis.

discussion on cryptography, then perhaps we can settle for watching you discredit
yourself.

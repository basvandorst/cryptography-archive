This is a major piece of the problem.  The people I've met and
dealt with (librarians, examiners, up to commissioner) are very
sharp, and are quite competent!   One examiner I met had his
BSCS, four years out of school, four years with the PTO, one
of the most senior examiners, and was earning in the low $30s.
Maybe things are different here in silicon valley, but that is
VERY low pay for a BSCS 4 years out of school.

Remember, that these are government pay positions.  The PTO just
can't afford to hire and keep the people they need.  First, a
recent grad has a low salary to look at.  Secondly, after four
years (or is it five?) an examiner can leave and become a patent
agent with no exam needed -- this is a career path outside of the
PTO that can pay much MUCH more than does an examiner.

Of course, the other part of the problem is the lack of easily searchable
prior-art.  But that is, I understand, begining to be dealt with.

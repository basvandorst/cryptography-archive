Okay, I've had tons of mail from people saying "post it here!"  So
here goes, crossposted to alt.sources.  It comes in four parts:

	WPCRACK.DOC
	WPCRACK.C
	WPUNCRYP.DOC
	WPUNCRYP.C

It was written and compiled under Borland C, but I tried to make
everything as generic as possible, and it has been successfully
compiled on Unix systems (once I exchanged the non-standard "//"
comments for "/* */ comments).

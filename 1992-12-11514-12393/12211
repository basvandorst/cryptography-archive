I don't get this. If cryptographic SW or HW is illegal, how do you define
cryptography. If I invent another character set and translate from ASCII
to this new character set, will I be breaking French law? What is the
difference between another character set and a simple cryptographic system
with character-by-character replacement?

What about binary files? How can anyone tell the difference between a
binary file (containing, for example, a compiled version of a program)
and an encrypted text?

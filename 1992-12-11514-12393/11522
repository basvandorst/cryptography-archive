Well, another case with a current defendant about whom I am familiar has
to do with a ship that was 400 miles out on the high seas, transporting
cocaine from South America and on its way to Canada.  U.S. drug
marshalls were on the ship undercover trying to establish that some of
the coke was intended for the U.S.  But none of it was, and the captain
would not acquiesce to suggestions to land in the U.S. or enter its
waters.  Nevertheless, the crew was arrested for violating U.S. drug
laws in international waters.  The defendant I know of is currently
trying to quash the U.S. jurisdiction, but it doesn't look good.  The
penalty under mandatory federal sentencing for the crime he's accused of
is life without possibility of parole; versus several years (merely) in
Canada.  Yes, indeed, the long arm of the law has gotten a little out of
hand for our Uncle Sam.

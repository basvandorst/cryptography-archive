   ..like, you can't threaten the life of a policeman with an encryption
   program.  You can with an Uzi.(sp?)  

Sure you can!

	We'd have sent a postcard, but it might have fingerprints.
	And here's the mayor's passphrase we copied off the yellow stickynote
	near his desk to let you know we can stop your paychecks if you squeal.

   [To which the anti-crypto forces say: you can plot in secret behind
   the encryption program to ambush the policeman.]
   [To which I say: you can plot in secret in an open
   field or a Washington parking garage.]
	{ you mean - YOU! - were Deep Throat?!?!? }

You can also keep secret documents or child pornography in a safe deposit box
and refuse to tell the government where it is (or that you have one) --
only you and your co-conspirators know.  Or mail it to a post office box.
While the government CAN order all the banks in town to let them
search all the boxes, and can open everybody's mail-in-brown-paper-envelopes,
it's a major violation of everybody's privacy, and they can't get away
with it often, because the public recognizes it for what it is.
What we have to do is convince the public that cryptography is the same thing.

   I wish this analogy would get shot down once and for all.  It's incredibly
   stupid.  I realize that diplomats and then the military were the first
   to use crypto.  
Agreed.  They were also early users of postal services and safes,
and you can't run a major military without them.  
We'd better not allow Private Citizens to use those technologies, 
because the COMMIES and the MAFIA might use them too!

   The military was the first to use combat boots.
   Does that make combat boots weapons?
If combat boots were legal, why, YOUR MAMA might wear them  :-)

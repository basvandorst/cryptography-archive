Summary for readers with little time: Uri Blumenthal insists that
stripping the ----BEGIN PGP lines from PGP messages makes things more
"secure" by eliminating the "proof" that you are using PGP. In this
reply to his most recent message to me, I explain precisely why its
trivial for an eavesdropper to detect that PGP messages are going by
in EMail.

Please carefully re-read what I said, and what I say in this message.

The data is not "hexadecimal"; its in Radix 64 format.  I can readily
detect the presense of Radix 64 data -- a very simple regular
expression filter will allow one to detect candidate lines of Radix
64, and at a fast enough speed that one can sort through all the mail
going through even as high volume a gateway as, say, UUNet. Once a
regular expression has found such a line, its easy to check if
subsequent lines indeed contain more apparent Radix 64 data. One may
then assume that one is indeed confronting Radix 64 data, and
transform it into binary. Once turned into binary, one may attempt to
interpret the data as a PGP format file. PGP files are NOT random in
their first bits -- they contain magic numbers, file lengths, and
other such things that can be used to determine if the candidate file
is indeed a PGP file. As an example, I can check to make sure that the
first byte of the data contains the CTB for an RSA public key
encrypted packet, that the next two bytes contain the length of the
packet, that the fourth byte contains a "2" for version two, etc.

However, you insist that all of this is impossible, in spite of the
fact that your PGP program more or less does all of it every day.

How exactly does it make it "unprovable"? In the sense that anyone can
add those lines to any message they send, they "prove" nothing about
the contents, and in the sense that anyone can detect that a mail
message contains PGP data even without those lines, one would appear
in another sense to be able to "prove" that a message was created with
PGP even without those lines being present. Stripping the lines would
appear to do you not a lick of good -- it does not fundamentally
change anything.

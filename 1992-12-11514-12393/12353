Why do you believe that using PGP is illegal?  According to PKP, it is
clearly within the rights of an individual to use PGP for one's own personal
use, among other uses that are allowed by PKP and not considered infringements.
Besides, I am puzzled as to how someone can claim an exclusive monopoly on
technology invented while they were on the public payroll (the RSA algorithm
was developed at MIT).

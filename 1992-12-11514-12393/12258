>>Is there a published description of these algorithms anywhere? If not,
then does anyone know if software incorporating these algorithms has
actually been exported out of the US?<<

He explains this in the documentation, saying that any secure algorithm 
should be able to be distributed freely to enable others to study the 
algorithm. That way there is less of a chance that he is releasing a weak 
algorithm.

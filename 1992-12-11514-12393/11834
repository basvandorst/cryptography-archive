Lucio de Re asks if commercial products using RSA cannot be exported. That's
right. The version of Lotus Notes that uses it is an example.

I guess companies think there's a big enough market without it. Given
the notorious lack of ethics in some countries, leading to massive
software piracy (Italy and Taiwan come immediately to mind), they
probably aren't losing much anyway.

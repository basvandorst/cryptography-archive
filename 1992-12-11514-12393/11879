It's quite good.  The above observation is true, and of course, the reason 
it's not available yet.  Ironically enough, PEM with certificates would make 
it much easier to release a product like RIPEM.  There's just a bit of a 
catch-22 at the moment.

I don't think that anyone is under the illusion that RIPEM (or any other PD 
implementations of PEM) are not going to be smuggled out of the U.S. almost 
immediately.  The issue is simply one of putting enough safeguards at the 
distribution sites to ensure that said sites are not the ones that will get 
hit by any legal repercussions.

After all, if I give you the software and you smuggle it out of the country, 
that's your problem.  I just have to be able to show that it wasn't me that 
did the exporting, and that I didn't know you were going to.  This is not an 
intractable problem by any means; it's just slightly more complex than 
plopping a tar file into an FTP directory.  Working out those sorts of 
details is what is taking the time.

Additional safeguards will also help distribution sites cooperate with 
investigators if a U.S. attorney *does* decide to pursue the matter.

Examples of these safeguards might include:

 - detailed logs of all transfers
 - excluding non-US Internet domains and IP networks
 - requiring explicit requests for access, which would be kept on file

and so on.

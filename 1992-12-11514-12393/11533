One case is so widespread that many people don't think about it:
personal authentication information. You keep your password secret and
cryptography is often used to protect its confidentiality.  The Unix
password file is, of course, encrypted.  One time password systems
like Racal's WatchWord or Secure Computing's LOCKOut (plug) use
cryptography for secure personal authentication.

Some people argue that the FBI has some duty, privilege, or obligation
to collect traffic keys. Even so, is there any reason why they should
collect, say, the secret key half of the public key used by an
individual for authentication?  They might have a legally justifiable
need to know _who_ was authenticated, but they don't need the ability
to masquerade as that individual.  The courts could easily rule that
such usage is "entrapment" or "forgery" anyway.

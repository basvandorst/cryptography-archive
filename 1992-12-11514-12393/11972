and if my grandma had baytzim she'd have been my grandpa. Amazing
how many rationalizations are being invented by many here, not
just Rubin, to justify a wrong.

Surely there's no compulsion on a patent holder to license what they
consider to be a violation, after the fact. Both PGP 1.x and 2.x were
presented as faits accompli. There was no advance request or
inquiry about licensing. In fact, as I read it the notion of licensing
came up after PKP objected. Hardly clean hands, if accurate.

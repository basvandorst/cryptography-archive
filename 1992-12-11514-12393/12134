GSM has encryption algorithms for encrypting of both speech/data
and of signalling. The encryption is over the air (from user to
base station) and not between two users. If there is a call between
two GSM subscribers, the encryption at both ends is independent of
the other. The actual keys are NEVER transferred over the air.

Some of the algorithms used are specified in the GSM specs.
Some of them are (or can be) operator specific. This is because
each subscriber gets an intelligent card from the operator
which (and not the actual GSM phone) carries the subscriber
dependent info.

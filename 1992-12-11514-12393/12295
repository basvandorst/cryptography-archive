I fail to see your point.  Are you claiming that RSA was obvious?
I suggest you read

@article{Diffie88,
   author = {Whitfield Diffie},
   journal = {Proceedings of the IEEE},
   month = {May},
   number = {5},
   pages = {560--577},
   title = {The First Ten Years of Public Key Cryptography},
   volume = {76},
   year = {1988}
}

Believe me, it wasn't obvious to a lot of smart *and* educated people.

Yes, RSA is eminently comprehensible now, almost obvious, one would say.
Lots of brilliant inventions are obvious in retrospect.  So what?

To my way of thinking, RSA is about the best example there is of why
``software'' patents should be valid.  Apart from the technicality that
it can be (and often is) implemented in hardware, we have something that's
new (that factoring is difficult isn't new -- but a practical use is),
useful (or we'd be discussing this in sci.math, not sci.crypt), and
very definitely non-obvious.

Though Rubin is perfectly correct, the LPF position is not only a
minority one, but flies in the face of the law. It's not a relevant
argument in the main substance of this discussion, but rather a
passing point. It carries as much weight with respect to the issues
we're discussing as the position that phone service should be free
would in a discussion of why it's a bad idea not to pay your phone
bill.

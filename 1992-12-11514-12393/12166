Jyrki asks me to cite the law prohibiting the possession of illegally
imported munitions. I've already done so. Since possession of
munitions of foreign source requires an import license, the charge
would be possession of unlicensed imports, a felony. They might
even get you under the customs laws as well as the Munitions laws.

Moreover, it could be dealt with severely if it could be shown that
the possessor knew PGP wasn't licensed as, for example, those in this
discussion do. As I recall, there are even warnings about U.S. use of
PGP in the PGP documentation.

This response is probably going into thin air, with respect to Jyrki,
since he says he's put me in his kill file.

I've noticed that this discussion is degenerating into a lot of
nit-picking questions; I guess that means it's time to ignore them in
aid of moving on. Henceforth I won't answer such questions; my silence
won't denote assent. (Sigh of relief from some correspondents.)

I will, however, pick up on new issues that seem significant.

David

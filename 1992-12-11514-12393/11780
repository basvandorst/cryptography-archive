    Good news!  PGP has been ported to the Apple Macintosh (a nontrivial
feat)!  The following note is from Zig Fiedorowicz, the implementer:

    "A Macintosh port of PGP 2.0 has been placed in the
    /mac/util/encryption directory of mac.archive.umich.edu.  It has a
    modest Macintosh interface. It has not been tested extensively and
    should be considered a beta version. Bug reports are welcome.  More
    work on MacPGP is planned and later versions will be more widely
    distributed." --Zig Fiedorowicz (zigf@mps.ohio-state.edu)

    The Mac version has also been posted for anonymous ftp at the following
sites:

    plaza.aarnet.edu.au
        /micros/mac/umich/util/encryption/macpgp2.0.sit.hqx

    pencil.cs.missouri.edu
        /pub/crypt/macpgp2.0.sit.hqx

    wuarchive.wustl.edu
        /mirrors3/archive.umich.edu/mac/util/encryption/macpgp2.0.sit.hqx

    src.doc.ic.ac.uk
        /computing/systems/mac/umich/util/encryption/macpgp2.0.sit.hqx.Z

You can also get it at the following site by logging in as "iscabbs" (i.e.,
not as "anonymous":

    grind.isca.uiowa.edu  (128.255.19.233)
        /mac/macintosh/app/mac-pgp-20.dst

    America Online also carries the Mac PGP 2.0.  I do not know the exact name
under which is carried, but I imagine subscribers should have no problem
finding it.

    If none of these sites do it for you, let me know.  Film at 11.

    Best regards!

P.S.:  If you come across sites where it's posted -- especially FREE ACCESS
sites -- please drop me a line (info-pgp-request@lucpul.it.luc.edu).
I'd like to maintain a current list as part of a PGP FAQ list.  Thanks to the
many correspondents who have helped to contribute to this list on an almost
daily basis!

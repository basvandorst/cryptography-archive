Discussion of key registration (and prospects of crypto users
being compelled to reveal *some* plaintext-producing key) will
likely accelerate the study of multiplex encryption, of combining
several messages into a single ciphertext.  In the simplest 
scheme, ciphertext is derived from an intended message, its key,
a decoy message, and a pseudo-key.  The pseudo-key can unlock the
decoy, but the key is needed to extract the intended message.

One might suppose that a hidden message must be substantially
shorter than its decoy to avoid suggesting additional concealed
message.  A one-to-seven ratio is easy: a modern Bacon biliteral
cipher appends an extra bit onto each (7-bit) ascii character of
decoytext before superimposing a Vernam byte.

Decoytext need only be plausible enough to satisfy a decipherer
that it comprises the entire message.  Because it can be freely
chosen, a decoytext can contain words or phrases that appear in
the intended message; with this increase in total redundancy,
ciphertext based on a dictionary generated during (say) LZW
compression can easily contain both messages, yet be shorter
than either.

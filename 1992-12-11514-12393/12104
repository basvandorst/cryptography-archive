Ah, his message is mostly an oppinion? And what are all your messages?
Theorems maybe? I just pointed out that his message was an oppinion

That's why I tend to agree with his oppinions and not with yours.

It just means that you make the serious error to assume that all your
oponents think in one and the same way.

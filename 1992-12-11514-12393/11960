Arthur Rubin and others evade/dance around/avoid (I'm trying hard not
to give offense here--pick some other characterization if you like)
the issue by claiming a program is an algorithm and thus exempt. It
is not, and the law is quite specific on this point, no matter
what logical sophistry of a non-legal character may be argued.

While I've got your attention, folks, I'd like to say (nothing to
do with Rubin) that a lot of the discussion here amounts to extended
sophistry. What I mean by that is that someone comes up with a
conclusion (PKP are bad guys or some such), and then invents a
hypothesis (usually by mind-reading their motives) to prove it,
and presents the whole as if it were a logical argument.

This is usually exposed when the hypothesis is challenged and
the response is to offer a different hypothesis to prove the
same pre-conceived conclusion.

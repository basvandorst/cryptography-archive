This sounds like a great idea.

Is it possible to start a group as unmoderated and then change it over
later, if the nonsense traffic migrates to it?  If not, then I would
welcome a moderated group.  If so, I might try it unmoderated first
in order to see if the nonsense moves (hoping it doesn't).

Of course, if those engaged in flaming on sci.crypt were to just move to
another group (a talk.* group?), this might not be required.  As I remember
it from the past, sci.crypt was to have precisely the charter offered
for this group.

For that matter, can sci.crypt be converted to a moderated group?

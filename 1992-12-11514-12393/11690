I can't remember the name of it, but I remember seeing a program that was
floating around the net that could break files encrypted with WordPerfect.
I'm pretty sure that the version that was available publicly was intended
more as a demonstration of the weakness of wp's crypt algorithm rather
than as a tool for breaking into files.  It was limited to files encrypted
with passwords that were four characters or less in length.  I think that
there was a more powerful version available for a fee, but I might be
mistaken about that.

If it's important to get recover whatever's been encrypted, you might be
better off getting in touch with this company:

	AccessData
	87 East 600 South
	Orem, Utah  84508
	(800) 658-5199

It says in the documentation to PGP that this company seels a program for
$185 that will decrypt files locked with WordPerfect and a variety of
other programs.  According to the PGP docs, the program doesn't just guess
passwords -- which is what I *believe* the program I mentioned above does.
It uses more sophisticated techniques that are much faster.  You can read
about it in the docs for PGP2.1 (for FTP locations, check
alt.security.pgp), in the section on "Snake-Oil".

BTW:  If you do buy this program, will you post something about it?  I'm
curious about how well it works.

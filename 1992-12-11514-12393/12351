Anyone seen the article in the January 1993 Dr. Dobb's about LUC?  It's supposed
to be more secure than RSA, and it was developed in Australia (which means it
isn't hamstrung by the silly ITAR)...

I haven't analyzed the algorithms yet, but I thought I'd mention it here and
invite comment, pro or con.

No need to ask; most large banks have signs printed and posted in plain
view for you to see that the current reportable limit is (still) $10k.
Certainly the Tax Court has ruled that when multiple transactions occur
in such a way as to try to avoid the $10k limit (e.g., multiple $9k
transactions), they can be considered one transaction for the purposes
of the regulation.

But it has not "quietly" been changed to $2k.

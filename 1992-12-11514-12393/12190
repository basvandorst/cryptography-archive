Summary: Where, oh where, is this newsgroup?
X-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL6]

I've heard it said more than once that there is a newsgroup named
alt.security.ripem.  However, no such group has reached my site or
any sites I've probed via Gopher.  I've been hearing these rumors
now for a while; any ideas on what's up?

Thanks.

(The reasons for my interest in alt.security.ripem should be obvious.)

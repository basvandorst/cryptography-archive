I was wondering - my cable listings dont provive codes for
Comedy Central, channel 39. Drat. I always want to tape
Mystery Science Theatre 3000 on Friday Evenings and
Saturday Mornings.

I was furious when I called Gemstar and asked them how to
get to program the numbers myself. They told me to screw off.

So, I did a little figurin'.

I played for an hour with the box, and realized something.

Year (operater) code = Channel, Time, and Length
BUT! Many times, the DATE will USUALLY still be the same. Hm...

So, I was wondering if anyone WROTE a program that'll
let you input today's date, the channel you want, the time and 
length, and the VCR Plus code would be spit out.

Let me know, I am really curious.
I have never even attempted to crack any other code in my life,
but am willing to learn!!

Also, I did finally get the code out of the guy. It took 30 minutes of
badgering and pleading. But that code is only good for next week, unless
I say I want it EVERY week with the weekly button.

increase security? not if you're using PGP to sign your public
posts. all anyone who wants to prove you're using PGP has to do
is

 a) add their own begin/end lines like anyone else
 b) run it through PGP with your public key. if PGP correctly verifies
	your message then there's no way you can deny it. that's
	the whole point of digital signatures.

if they want to get you they'll do it with or without the begin/end
lines. anything the average reader can verify the Feds can verify.
by taking out the taglines you're just adding an extra step.

Since Arthur Rubin, in his latest message, calls PKP's attempt
to protect their hard-won patent rights to their brilliant
invention (without which there'd be no PGP or ripem or
any other such system)  "persecution", it's obvious
that he's writing from a different ethical universe than
the one I live in, and any attempt to reason further with
him would be fruitless.

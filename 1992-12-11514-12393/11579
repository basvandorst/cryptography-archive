   According to _Your Right to Privacy_ Hendricks, Hayden, Novik
   (An American Civil Liberties Union Handbook)

   Q:	Is the SSN a universal identifier?
   A:	Not technically...to be a true universal identifier, a label would have
   to be unique to each person, no more than one person would have a given number
   [1-to-1 mapping].  A person would carry the same number throughout his life,
   and it would not be reused after his death.  It would contain internal check
   features...The SSN does not meet these criteria.  [examples deleted]


Another counter example: I do not have a SSN.

USA != Universe.

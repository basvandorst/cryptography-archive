The Munitions Act?  Possibly, as it does seem (according to RSA) that the
Munitions Act forbids import of munitions.  Possession of PGP clearly does
NOT violate PKP's patents.  One might say that possession implies
incitement to use, but that does not seem likely.  (Of course RSA/PKP can
sue anyone they want to.)  Of course, anyone outside the U.S. can use it
unless the exporting site or the user has similar laws to the (U S)
Munitions Act.

Use of a patent later determined to be improper is and was always legal. 
It's risky, but legal.

Agreed.

It seems unlikely that US and foreign programs can be maintained in synch,
without violating the Munitions Act, unless the program being published
makes it not subject to the Munitions Act, which (as far as I know, and not
contradicted by RSA's statement) still open.

Patent law is self-enforcing; i.e. patent violations are (usually) not
criminal, but civil.  Hence you really can't say that people use PGP are
violating patent law, unless PKP (at their expense) makes that claim in
court.

Note:  I do not have PGP on any machines (I personally) have access to.

Another question would be - what are the likely and the worst
consequences of being caught with "illegal" PGP? Assuming
personal, non-commercial "home" usage? 

[Lots of people violate speed limit, some are caught... I'd assume
if everybody drove a bit below the limit - then every offender
going a mile above the limit, would be stopped.  In reality 
(luckily :-) one has to go faster than that to attract 
attention. By the same logic, if most of the people 
used PGP - it wouldn't be reasonable/possible to 
"stop" every user...

But  "selective enforcement"  could be used: if "they" don't 
like you - they'll stop you for going 56 on 55 limit,  while 
everybody else is happily cruising at 64...]

Well, RIPEM uses RSAREF, which PKP "licensed" for non-commercial use 
for free.  Am I sure PKP won't revoke this license?  Well, I would
not trust them as far as I can fly, and I can't fly at all! (:-)

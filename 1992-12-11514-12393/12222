Paul Leyland posts a good suggestion if the existence of my key in
Bontchev's key file were a crime to be remedied. It is not. It is an
inconvenience to Vesselin, according to his posts, and he thinks an
inconvenience to others. What is more, I did not export my key,
someone took it outside the US.

Using Vesselin's own arguments, there's nothing illegal about my key
circulating outside the U.S. As I read the section of the Munitions
Act I quoted much earlier, there's even nothing illegal about
exporting keys (though I didn't). It's the software, algorithms,
flowcharts that are mentioned in the regulation.

Thus for me to use PGP in the U.S. to revoke the key (which I assert
would be a violation), would be committing a violation in order to
cure an inconvenience that isn't illegal.

Anyone who wishes to remove my key from his key ring as a result of
this correspondence may do so. If they fear there's some 'real'
Sternlight lurking somewhere who is being spoofed by this message,
that's got to be their problem, not mine.

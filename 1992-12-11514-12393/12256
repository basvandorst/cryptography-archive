Well, it's 7 years till the RSA patent expires.  As for IDEA -- it's
patented, too, which certainly restricts the use of PGP for commercial
purposes.  And at least some of DES's secret design parameters are now
known to have strengthened it.  FEAL was *much* weaker than DES because
it didn't possess those secret attributes.  That you don't understand
something about a cryptosystem doesn't mean that it's necessarily weaker.
It just means that the designers know more than you do.

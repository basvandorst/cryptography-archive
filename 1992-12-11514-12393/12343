I, too, am more confident with triple-DES -- but why call it only 112 bits?

If each of the 3 DES stages does its own CBC and has its own IV, then
each stage has (56+64) bits of key -- so the ensemble has 3*120 = 360 bits
of key.

Meanwhile, there's still my favorite:

	compress|des|tran|des|tran|des

(where tran was posted here a week or two ago)

Correct, that is what they do.  That sounds a lot like a 'Bill
of Attainder":

   "No Bill of Attainder or ex post facto Law shall be passed."

Congress is forbidden from doing such a thing.

Of course by cutting funding to projects which the feds have sole
power to execute, they are not fulfilling their Constitutional
duties (a violation to their oath of office).  I think they could
be hosed over in court.

 Not everyone shares Sternlight's opinion that "RSA has patents on a wonderful
 invention and they are entitled to the fruits of their work."  See
 pesp. the FSF's position on algorithmic patents for an opposing view.

I think you're thinking of the position paper "Against Software Patents",
from the League for Programming Freedom, not the FSF.  Write to
league@uunet.uu.net if you want a copy.

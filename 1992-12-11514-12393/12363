Although "secure" wireless phones may exist, it would be impossible
for the general public to obtain one.  Strictly speaking, a "secure" device
would allow discussion or dissemination of classified material
over a non-secure link (i.e. phone lines, air waves) and thus
would be unavailable to the public. 
  As far as Motorola's offering, I suspect it doesn't use anything that
the NSA can't crack.  It may just turn speach into digital pulses that
can be reassembled at the receiving end.

It may not be right, but it certainly is legal as long as the contents
of that conversation are not disclosed.  Cellular conversations are 
"protected" from eavesdropping thanks to the fine folks on capitol hill.
But that doesn't mean anyone with a scanner or even an old TV which
covered UHF channels up to 83 can't listen in.

I agree with you, there *should* be devices available which would allow
a reasonable amount of privacy.  Law enforcement and
spy-catching would be hampered, however, if such devices were available to the
general public.  What's interesting though, is that the *real* spies
and criminals probably already use such devices.  They're not that hard
to build (at least I wouldn't think so).  Get a couple of A-D converters,
maybe a DES chip, and you're all set, more or less ( I don't know, I've
never built one).
  This lack of privacy is precisely why I *won't* purchase a cordless
phone.

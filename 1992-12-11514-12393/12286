	You are not alone.  Your struggle is everyone's struggle.  Those of
	us who are not gay realize that "first they came for the gays. . ."
	if I might paraphrase Pastor Niemoller.  And your alienation from
	the current system of "intellectual property" is shared by others too.

	I think that this act of yours is very useful.  Just like coming out
	it makes it "okay" for others and makes others who share your 
	alienation more courageous.  One thing leads to another and pretty
	soon it snowballs.  Even though each individual is limited in what
	he or she can do the collective action of many like minded people
	can move mountains.  Thank you.

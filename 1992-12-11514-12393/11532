   Well, another case with a current defendant about whom I am
   familiar has to do with a ship that was 400 miles out on the high
   seas, transporting cocaine from South America and on its way to
   Canada.  U.S. drug marshalls were on the ship undercover trying to
   establish that some of the coke was intended for the U.S.  But none
   of it was, and the captain would not acquiesce to suggestions to
   land in the U.S. or enter its waters.  Nevertheless, the crew was
   arrested for violating U.S. drug laws in international waters.  The
   defendant I know of is currently trying to quash the U.S.
   jurisdiction, but it doesn't look good.  The penalty under
   mandatory federal sentencing for the crime he's accused of is life
   without possibility of parole; versus several years (merely) in
   Canada.  Yes, indeed, the long arm of the law has gotten a little
   out of hand for our Uncle Sam.

A conclusion with which, despite my previous post, I would agree.
Please keep us informed about this.  I would think it a violation of
the treaty governing navigation on the high seas, but I don't know who
would complain except the country under which the ship was registered.
Do you know the country of registry?

This does indeed stink.

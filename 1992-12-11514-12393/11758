Nope.  With something like a cryptosystem, the very fact that it's wide-
spread makes it undesirable for really sensitive messages.  PGP, if
widespread -- and for that matter, DES right now -- are important targets
for NSA et al. simply because they could recover a lot of traffic given
a general solution methodology.

Realy?  From everything I've heard, the opposite is true, especially if
the numbers are large enough.

I believe you're using "cryptography" in the above statement where it
would be more accurate and appropriate to use "message concealment."
Cryptography is certainly one mechanism for message concealment, but
there are many others.  I hope you're not suggesting that all message
concealment should be discouraged.

Once you allow for message concealment, you should allow for _effective_
message concealment, by the "good guys" as well as the "bad guys."
Somehow the definitions of "good guys" and "bad guys" seem to be very
dynamic.

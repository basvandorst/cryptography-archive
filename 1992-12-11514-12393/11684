RSA is best because it provides for secure communication with a 
minimum of pre-arrangement.  

DES is best because it is public, thoroughly analysed, relatively 
fast, provides high security for a short key, and because its security 
is relatively independent of the choice of key (i.e., most of the keys
in the key space are good.)

DES is the mechanism of choice for most (non-defense) applications 
save key management where RSA is preferred.

The military will argue that secret algorithms are to be preferred for
all applications.  However, you may only use secret algorithms if you
have an entire stable of cryptographers.  The rest of us have no choice
but to use public and standardized mechanisms.

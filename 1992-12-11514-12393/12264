   is this an issue of ethics?  beyond a patent's lifetime, is it ethical
   to take an invention?  17 years: ethical; a day less: unethical?  

   i don't think so.  we're talking about laws here, not ethics.

David seems to be arguing that breaking the law is unethical, as he
disparaged the use of civil disobedience (or else he doesn't
understand his own arguments).  But then why argue that the use of RSA
is unethical in Europe??

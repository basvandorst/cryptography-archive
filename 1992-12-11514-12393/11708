I played with it for a while. Your right about the 143 byte period. It
appears that
  1) each byte gets encypted separately.
  2) it's not self-reversing.
  3) the substitution table changes from byte to byte but repeats
     every 143 bytes.
Probably the easiest thing to do is find the code that does it, but
BASIC is a *big* program.

Anyone know of one of those PC books that goes into this?

	I read about a week or so ago from USA Electronic edition of
"Telecomunication", that phones in Europe (Cellular) were going to have
encrypt/decrypt device in them.  I was wondering what the state of affairs
in US are concerning this possibility for us, and in particular, are there
legal devices to buy to encrypt/decrypt one's voice transmission via a 
normal phone line?  I thought this would be an appropriate place to post this.
Thanks,

Laws are made by the government.  The government *supposedly* represents
the public.  Cryptography is MEANT to keep things secret from the public
at large.  You might as well outlaw secrecy.  Oh, I forgot, they're already 
trying to outlaw privacy. :-(  Is only logical that *our* :-) government
would make it illegal/impossible to keep our files from being unreadable
by the public.

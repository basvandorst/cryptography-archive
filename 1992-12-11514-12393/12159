Does anyone have an opinion on RSA's announcement that they are
licensing their RC2 and RC4 encryption algorithms? They claim "these
algorithms have recently been singled out by the Department of State
for expedited export approval."

Does anyone have an opinion on the technical merits of RC2 and RC4?

It information also states that it is a "drop-in" replacement for DES,
does that mean it can be used with RIPEM?

I know that some of this information is available by ftp from rsa.com,
but I'm looking for third-party opinions.

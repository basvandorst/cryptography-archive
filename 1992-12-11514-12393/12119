You also shouldn't overlook that many consider the only crime
committed here to be the US Government's issuance of the software
patent in the first place.  Even the most die-hard supporters of
property rights, the Libertarians, do not grant that a government
has any moral right to create a monopoly supported solely by
force to prevent the free exchange of information.  Public Key
Partners, to whom the patent was issued, has consistently refused
all attempts by private parties to license the technology at any
price, thereby making it unusable in the US.  They do not produce
any software; they do not provide any service.  They are leeches
on society who keep people out of work and uninformed, and in my
mind, they and the US Patent Office are the criminals here.

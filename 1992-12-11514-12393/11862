I have a question concerning the atcual meaning of the word "algorithm" and 
the word "implementation" in regards to the discussion of the importation
of PGP to the US. A compiled binary program is obviously and "implemenation."
However,  is an uncompiled source code an "implementation"  or is it an
"algorithm?"  

	My question is is it possible to distribute a very 
accurate version of the algorithm for PGP that with a little work, here
in North America, could be developed into a real working implemenation?
What sort of modifications to c-code would be necessary to make it an 
"algorithm" rather than an implemenatation.

	Am I going off the deep end here?

	Good.  Let the tea party begin. ;-)  You sound like a patriot to me.

	Good, I wish it were obvious to more people how stupid the concept
	of a software patent is.  Imagine having to pay Newton for the 
	algorithm for calculating the derivative of a polynomial. . . 
	Utterly ridiculous.  It amazes me how many engineers fall for this
	foolishness.  I think it is because they harbor false hopes of
	profiting from it.  They seem not to realize that most inventions 
	aren't REALLY owned by the people who created them but instead by
	money men who own the ideas of the "kept" engineers that make up 
	the vast majority of working engineers and scientists in this
	country.

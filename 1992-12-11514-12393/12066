Bob (also posted to net):

This isn't exactly what you asked for, but the May/June 92 issue
of INFOSecurity Product News has an article entitled
"The rules for exporting encryption software".  It's written
by a lawyer and an export consultant, and is as in-depth as
you're likely to find in a magazine article anywhere.

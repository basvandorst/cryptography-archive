Perry Metzger makes the same ethical error many others have, of
looking at PGP2.0 in Europe in isolation. Both ethics and
the law don't do that--they look at the causal chain. There's
a well established principle about the fruits of a crime. The
law often confiscates the money gained, for example, from
insider trading.

PGP 1.0 was a violation of the RSA patents. Consider it having a label
called "fruits of a violation". That label isn't removed simply
because it passes over some wires to Europe.  Note carefully: a copy
of PGP 1.0 brought to Europe from the U.S. is NOT ethically equivalent
to a PGP 1.0 programmed from scratch in Europe.

I would agree completely that a programmed-from-scratch implementation
of RSA in a country where they don't have patent protection is
perfectly legal and ethical. I would not agree that a copy tranported
from the U.S., where it is not legitimate, somehow is washed clean in
the blood of the lamb (have I got the metaphor right?) as it arrives
at the other end of the phone line.

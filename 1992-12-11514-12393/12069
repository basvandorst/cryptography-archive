Besides which, creation and distribution of PGP source is not illegal in
any sense, any more than dissemination of any description of the RSA 
algorithm is illegal. It is only the use of the program within the USA that 
may be forbidden by US law.

I am really curious about David Sternlight's motivation in this bunfight. 
Does he have a financial stake in PKP, or has he simply painted himself into
a corner and is trying to salvage his honour?

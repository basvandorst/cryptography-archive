Suggested by Germano Caronni's message:

Wasn't it a Swiss firm, Hagelin AG, that (according to Bamford) sold
cryptographic devices for years while both cooperating with governmental
code breakers, and perhaps even knowing their system was broken?

I'm asking, not accusing, but it would be an amusing historical
footnote to IDEA being the product of a Swiss firm.

No reading between the lines, please. :-)

Oh really?!

Think about it!  DES is available Out There.  RSA is available Out There.
The PEM documents are available Out There.  All one has to do is send
a few RIPEM encrypted messages Out There for someone to figure out the
necessary glue for a RIPEM clone.  It's NOT that hard to reverse engineer.

Whoever does will have made a legal means of private mail exchange with 
subjects of the USGovernment, which could be worth the effort to someone
who needs same.

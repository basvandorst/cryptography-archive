 formal RFD is posted.]

Ah, here we are again. Back in the "hard" and "soft" group hierarchies. In
a way I like the idea. But, I'd rather have related groups close and in the
same tree. It's a fact of life that many branches of science have a political
sides. Gene research is one example, cryptology (or was that cryptography).

And, more important: If there were two groups `talk.crypt' and `sci.crypt',
which group do you think would receive the "Is DES in the public domain"
and "Can someone post a C implementation of RSA real fast" traffic?

A minor point is that it may satisfy some of the political posters to
have their flame-fast in a sci.crypt backyard rather than in some
faraway talk-group.  :-)

I guess the best thing to do is to make the smallest part of the group
make the move. The "get out of this group, we just created another one
for you guys" may not work. However, this is a rather pessimistic view.

To some people, the strongest hint should be the "sci" and "talk". I'm
not one of them. The word "research" may not be the best name however.
Maybe `sci.crypt.theory' is better. And, it should probably be a moderated
group. If moderator doesn't approve you can post in an unmoderated `sci.crypt'.

Finally, the name `talk.crypt' may be misleading. What's the purpose. A group
for posting encrypted articles???

Yup, but the same users usually can be really obsessed with strict
newsgroup charters and will interpret official guidelines as a court
order.

Anyway...
	NO 	to sci.crypt.research
	NO 	to talk.crypt
	YES	to sci.crypt.theory  moderated

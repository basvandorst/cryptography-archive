In addition to his other erroneous messages, to which I'm not going
to reply because I'm not repeating old substance--let Metzger read--
Metzger posts this bit of nastiness. Once more it shows
that he's not reading but just spewing forth. I acknowledged the
lapse in making a play on Jyrki's first name and expressed regrets
about a day ago in a public post, as well as privately to Jyrki.

But Metzger isn't interested in a serious discussion--just in making
himself right and others wrong. He can say what he likes-- I won't
respond further to such as he.

Thanks to all those who responded.  I was able to figure out how ARJ does 
it's encryption.  It was simpler than I suspected.  ARJ adds a single
byte constant to each character in the password and then does an XOR
with this new password to generate the encrypted, compressed file.
  I suspect that this constant is generated from the system clock, but
that doesn't really matter, since ARJ stores this constant in the
local file header at offset 0xb.

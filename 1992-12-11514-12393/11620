This is a question about nomenclature.  As you may or may not know, I am
currently writing a cryptography book.  Of course, I am discussing both
secret-key cryptography and public-key cryptography.  The problem arises
as to how to refer to the various keys.  For secret-key cryptosystems, such
as DES, I am calling the key K.  For public-key cryptosystems, I would like
to use a different single letter to refer to the public key and the private
key.  Unfortunately, the words "public" and "private" start with the same 
letter.  I thought about calling the public key P, for "public," and the
private key S, for "secret."  This works, but it may be confusing for
the S for private key to have nothing to do with secret-key cryptography.

I like the idea that a secret is something you share with your confidents,
like a shared secret key.  A private key, on the other hand, is shared with
no one.

Honestly, no solution is really satisfying to me.  Does anyone out there
have any ideas?


I would like to thank everyone who has volunteered to read and edit my
manuscript.  Be assured that even though I have not responded personally
to you all, I have your names on file.  I expect the introduction and the
first section (about protocols) to be finished within a couple of weeks.

The book is scheduled for publication in August, althogh it will probably 
be late.  Currently the title is Cryptography in C, which I hate.  I would
entertain other suggestions.  What's a good title for a cryptography book
aimed at programmers?  I like Applied Cryptography: Protocols, Applications,
and Algorithms in C.  (Of course, for maximum salability, I should use all
the buzzwords: Real-time Object-oriented Cryptography in C++ Using Structured
Analysis and GUI.)

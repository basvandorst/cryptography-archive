What are the extra properties, and how large should they be to be reasonable
secure?

Huh?  1 mod x =x, correct?  That is. modulus is the remainder of integer
division, and when you take 1 and mod it, you will always have a remainder
equal to your original.

I finally discovered, at the age of 21, what all of my friends had found out
at 12 or 13-that your parents are just as fucked-up and wierd as everyone
else.  Politically Correct:  Socially, Politcally, and Environmentally
concious to the point of nausea.  tsa%cellar@tredysvr.tredydev.unisys.com

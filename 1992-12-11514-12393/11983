Not really.  It seems to me what he said was that the patent is clearly not
legal; but that PGP probably infringes on the patent.  (Also, that
prosecution is unlikely, but the primary reason it is unlikely that it
would fail.)

It appears not to be violating the Munitions Act, only the regulations. 
The regulations are (in his specific opinion) contrary to the law.  If you
think the patent is valid, then ethically you cannot use PGP.

You said this already.  The only way to test a patent that you think is
invalid is to infringe and wait to be sued.  (Well, this is another way,
but it costs $2,000 - $10,000 filing fees in addition to legal costs.)

Fine.  Don't use PGP.

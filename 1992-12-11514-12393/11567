It seem to me that if the U.S. has the right to enforce its laws on the
high seas in this manner, then every country in the world, with the
possible exception of land-locked ones, have that right too.  Clearly, a
very ugly situation will result if any attempt is made by other
countries to begin enforcing their laws in this manner.  In fact, I
would be suprised if very many things remained legal in such a
situation.  A much better solution would be to let no country have
jurisdiction in international waters, perhaps giving the UN or some such
international agency enforce some set of applicable laws.

When I was a kid back in the seventies, I used to wonder why people in
the Middle East would protest against "American imperialism".  Now I
know that it's because we keep doing stupid things like this.  Just
because we are arguably the most powerful country in the world doesn't
give us the right to be the biggest asshole country in the world.

Well, we should rather avoid wars than avoiding use of cryptography.
Or would you prohibit the export of screws and nails?  Screws are surely
essential in building tanks, but the technology for manufacturing screws
is of course known outside of the U.S.

Isn't that equally the case with cryptography?  The algorithms and ideas
behind RSA, DES, MD5, etc. are known in europe, russia and - no doubt - iraq.
And all over the world there are programmers, who can implement RSA.  So why
should your government bother about letting americans export cryptographic
software?

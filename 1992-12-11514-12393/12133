I have been reading a 1988 paper by Miyaguchi, Shiraishi, and Shimizu in which
they describe an encryption algorithm they call FEAL-8.  I am interested in
this algorithm because it was designed to run quickly on computers.  I have 
never heard of it anywhere before and I have the following questions about it.
Can anyone help me?

1) Is FEAL-8 Secure (as compared to DES)?

2) Is C source code available for it anywhere?

3) Is it patented

4) Is it a good choice for a fast, secure private key method?


Thanks for any help you can give me.

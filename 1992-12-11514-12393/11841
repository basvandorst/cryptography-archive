Don't worry about it; first, it's our law and so our problem, and second
I really don't think that they would raise the whole embarrasing case to
stomp on the net.  Post away.  As it happens, I read Spycatcher anyway
when it first came out; our headmaster brought a copy across the pond
and it was briefly in the school library until the security services
started growling.

As a result, I learned that you can make more sense of a phone tap if
you simulate stereo with a delay in one ear, and that MI5 never found a
way to covertly open a letter sealed at every edge with clear sticky
tape.

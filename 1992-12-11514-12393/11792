	From what I understand, that's not totally true.  While the _specs_
might be the same, IBM also submitted a rationale for the DES method.  This
rationale document remains classified, and some wonder if it contains
information that severely weakens DES.  Some specific things that are
supposedly covered include the design of th S-boxes, i.e: why this
permutation and not some other?  For an interesting discussion of
research into the S-boxes, try "Cryptology for Mathematicians and Computer
Scientists."  I don't have it handy, or I'd give an author and ISBN.
The book is quite good, and gives Pascal source for DES and RSA
implementations.

See ya,
Heath

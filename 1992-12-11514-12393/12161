Steven Brewer's analogy between crypto and medical knowledge is
incomplete.  It's true that how to heal people in general is not on
the munitions list (but see below), but some aspects of how to make
them sick (i.e.  chemical and biological weapons) is.

So are some healing technologies, particularly some specialized
antidotes to the above.

Thus those aspects of medical knowledge having significant comparative
military advantage ARE on the munitions list, just as is crypto.

I'm not defending, just reporting. No flames about how bad CBW is,
please.

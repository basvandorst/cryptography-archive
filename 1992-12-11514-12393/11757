I've had a similar problem.  I don't know why, or if there are any other 
solutions.  But what I finally ended up doing was using a unix unzip
to unzip the zip file from funet, then rezip using a -ks option.
That archive I was able to unzip using PKUNZIP 1.1 on a DOS machine.

For some reason, implode type compression seemed to cause crc errors
sometimes, but for shrink compression seemed to work.

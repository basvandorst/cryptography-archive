Owen Lewis posts an interesting message in which he seems to think
that the genie is out of the bottle with respect to PGP. We shall
see.

Meanwhile, noting his Canute remark, this would be a good time to
point out that all my messages have been about the law as I
understood it, and ethics as I believe it.

In none of my messages have I taken a view on whether a legal
and ethical use of PGP would be a good thing or a bad thing. Those
with the wit to read between the lines will have understood that I
support legal public key cryptography.

Many of the attacks have taken  the form of attempting to demonize
my views, RSA, or other parties at interest. Some of the attacks
have been, uh, er, um, highly inappropriate.

Now that a new year is starting, I suggest we return to rational
discourse.

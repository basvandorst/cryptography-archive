German submariners and Japanese sailors may have a different point of view 
here...esp. in terms of 'lives saved' at Midway etc.   [Please note that
I'm an American as well...but death is death and cipher/codebreaking in war
often _causes_ it.  It's nice when it's the enemy's and not yours, but 
it's still death.]  And we did (rightly, I affirm) cause it to happen. So 
where is he wrong?  

My point is that you don't have to be anti-American to state that 
superior--often American--technology in war is a killer.  [Hell, 
ask Lee/Longstreet.  They'll tell you.]

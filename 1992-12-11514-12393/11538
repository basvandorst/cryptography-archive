The second sentence is a very good reason to question the first more
carefully; and not a conclusion that comes logically from the first 
sentence.  The fact that our liberties are eroding is a good reason to 
look and see if it *is* an "open-and-shut case."  It isn't, as 
follow-up posters noted.
 
Larry Loen (lwloen@rchland.vnet.ibm.com) stated the argument that
	others joined in as well when he wrote:

A closer example than the veil one somebody used is: stealing.  Most
civilized countries have criminalized stealing.  Does it therefore
follow that we should give jurisdiction on the high seas to the country
with the more Draconian penalty?  Should we let Saudi Arabia claim
jurisdiction over an incident of stealing on the high seas that might
coincidentally involve American citizens, when Saudi Arabia's penalty is
to chop off the defendant's hand?  Where is the nexus between the
criminal act and Saudi Arabia?  Similarly, the nexus is lacking in the
case I cited.  In fact, that is the legal issue that the judges seem
already to have decided in that case: that a nexus between the act and
the U.S. is not necessary for jurisdiction.

It seems much more reasonable to let the prospectively injured party --
Canada, in this case -- apply its own laws, without our inteference.

Btw, I was able to find out the registry of the ship.  It was somewhere
in the Caribbean.

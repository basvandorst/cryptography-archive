Wrong again.  Using PGP to read or send email appears to violate the
patent.  Using something made by a patented process (as opposed to the
object itself being patented) is not illegal.

Yes it is a fine line, and you are on the wrong side of it.  PGP is an
algorithm, so cannot be covered by a patent.  "Making" the patentable
process would be loading PGP onto a computer that can execute it, IF PGP
has no non-infringing uses.  "Useing" would be a specific infringing use.

That doesn't mean the Feds read the law.  I think we all agree that
exporting PGP, and probably importing PGP, is in violation of regulations. 
Whether the regulations are legal (consistent with the authorizing law and
the Constitution) is still open.

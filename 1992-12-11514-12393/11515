Eli Brandt * When I  bought my current  computer, I did  it by cashier's
             check. They wouldn't give me more than $2000 or so -- I had
             to  do  some  wierdness  involving  multiple banks. Several
             different  banks  had  the  same  limit,  so it's either an
             industry-wide convention or a Federal
                                 = = =

  I have  received and sent cashiers  checks well in excess  of $2000. I
  also know one individual who withdrew close to a mil with two cashiers
  checks  then  skipped  to  Europe  cashing  them  there.  Must of been
  something weird with your bank.

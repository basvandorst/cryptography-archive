Chris Burian speculates that the government looks for use of PGP
and then goes after people for patent infringement.

The government does not prosecute people for patent infringement, unless
the patent is held by the government. PKP would be the party at
interest here.

It is unlikely that the government would "tip off" PKP, since that
would be an acknowledgement that they're monitoring and using traffic
in general without a court order. It is, I believe, still illegal
for the NSA to monitor wholly domestic traffic, and the FBI cannot
do so without a court order showing probable cause for an individual
monitored. Though I'm not an attorney, I speculate that the FBI could
not get a general court order permitting monitoring of, say, domestic
Internet mail.

Of course PKP, if they had the time, could monitor newsgroups and public
posts, but it would be illegal for them to monitor private e-mail.

Thus unless someone provides a publicly posted reason for PKP to
believe (with enough legal conviction to get a discovery order from a
judge) that they are using PGP, there's probably little PKP can do.
(absent the possibility of an informant.)

Disclaimer: Nothing in this message should be read to imply I'm using
any system covered by PKP patents, in violation of such patents.

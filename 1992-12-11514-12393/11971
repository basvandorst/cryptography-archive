Arthur Rubin quotes a charge by another that PKP alleges Zimmerman
stole ideas from Mailsafe. This is a false rendering of what
Jim Bidzos said. (I notice that there's a lot of demonizing of
PKP going on here.)

In the Zimmerman telegram (sorry, couldn't resist) Phil says
he didn't take ideas from Mailsafe.

That's what Bidzos had claimed--that Phil took ideas. Bidzos' message
was explicit that such a practice wasn't illegal. Thus there was no
charge of stealing made by PKP on that matter.  What PKP did claim
(and Phil denied) was that Phil claimed (ready for another soap opera
sentence structure, boys and girls) PGP 1.x was all his own work, but
that Phil had Mailsafe and that a lot of ideas in 1.x were taken from
Mailsafe and thus those IDEAS weren't original with Phil. It was a
part of Bidzos message that I personally regret, in which Phil's
motives were being called into question. It seems to me we should keep
this, on all sides, to the facts, law, and ethics of the matter, but
not resort to imputing motives to people on any side of this issue.

Do you have evidence of this? How do you know that PGP wasn't produced
inside the US by anonymous people with fake outside authors being used
as fronts? You don't have any real evidence that any of the claimed
authors on the package even exist. Claiming a crime has been committed
without even having conducted the most rudimentary of investigations
seems hasty, especially for one so concerned with ethics and morality
and precision. Furthermore, according to what I have seen, the
criminals would seem to be the importers -- but you have no knowledge
of who actually imported the product, if it was indeed imported. Given
that the alleged criminals are completely unknown, and likely at this
point wholely unidentifiable, it would seem to be extraordinarily
difficult to conduct a prosecution.

Sounds like a good reason to switch from PGP to RIPEM.

More to the point, someone should publish an interface description for
PGP so that someone else can write a totally legal program which sends
and receives in PGP format but uses RSAREF and its individual license.
This way, those of us who would like to remain legally proper can participate
in the exchange of PGP-like mail.

Steve Gardner also ignores facts he must know in order to minimize
the seriousness with which the government takes crypto, by trying
to compare crypto to good boots (in order to make it appear silly
to consider crypto as munitions). Thousands of lives have been
saved by crypto, and several generals have referred to the 
Enigma and Purple decrypts as worth several divisions. Though
some may want universal secure cryptography, and make arguments
in support of it which are rational (though not without the
possibility of counter-argument), it is not possible to make
an argument that governments don't take crypto seriously,
and with good reason, because the data are incontrovertible.

P.S. I am not nor have I ever been a Jesuit, though I knew several
doing Ph.Ds in theoretical physics when I was at M.I.T., and
admired them enormously.

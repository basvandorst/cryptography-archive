	It is in principle by virtue of the fact that the SSN is *supposed*
	to be used *solely* for id in SS matters.  By law, it is illegal for
	a government or corporate entity to even ASK you for the number unless
	the purpose relates directly to SS issues.

	Now, in reality of course, all kinds of entities ask for this number.
	It seems that since the Social Security Act of 1974, certain other
	government offices have gotten legitimate access to the numbers.  Among
	these are the IRS who use this number as a (hopefully) unique 
	identifier for each citizen.

	When anyone (and I don't much care who it is) asks me for my SSN, I
	simply say "no can do".  When they tell me that I cannot be served or
	cannot this or that until They have my number, I tell them that to
	ask me for said number is agin' the law (which is true) and that they
	can be charged with serious felonies for doing so (which may be true,
	but I do not know, however it sure gets them off my back in a hurry!).

	The SSN is SUPPOSED to be different from a national id number, and
	in some ways it indeed is, but they are so badly abused that the legal
	protections afforded us under law seem to me to be worth less than the
	paper they are written on.  E.g., AT&T uses SSN as employee ID #, as
	does AT&T Employees Federal Credit Union.  Pisses me of like hell,
	but you don't say "no" when you are being newly hired.  Today, I'd
	tell `em to kiss off pronto, but of course the horse has already
	bolted out the door :(

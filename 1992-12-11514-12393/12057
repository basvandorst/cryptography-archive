Why do we need to get a member of Congress to do this? Last I heard,
we had a free press in this country. Except for some who have signed
away their civil rights in exchange for "sensitive" government jobs,
no American needs prior government approval to publish anything he/she
wants.

Cryptographic source code listings ("software") have appeared in many
widely published and internationally distributed books and magazines
over the past 15-20 years with nary a peep from the government. I've
been keeping a bibliography of these as I find them. I have something
like 7 or 8 entries for "DES source code" on my list now.  (I don't
count mere descriptions of the DES algorithm, as they're extremely
widespread. And as we all know, only Americans are capable of turning
them into C code anyway.)

As John Barlow has said, the best way to defend a right is to exercise
it. Often. I'm glad to see Bruce Schneier coming out with his book of
crypto code, and I'm happy to contribute my own public domain DES code
to his effort.

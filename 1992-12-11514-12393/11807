Actually, what comes to my mind is to get PGP 2.X on each and every
U.S. computer, net site, Usenet host, Fidonet, anynet - and then each
and every computer owner, net site, Fidonet, anynet could report
themselves to the Proper Authorities as illegal international arms
traders.

Is anyone familiar with the concept of "civil disobedience"?

Of course it's easy for me to say things like this.

If all the people who smoke marijuana would do it openly and not stop
smoking it openly even though put through the system, "they" would
either just have to simply swallow it and repeal the law or start a
civil war.  The problem is that after "they" shoot/put for life in
jail/fine $2M/hang/whatever a couple of those doing it openly the rest
will stop doing it openly.  Divide and conquer.

The reason, (which is down a few lines) is that no one knew *how* to effectively
do it.  Discovering that was extremely important.

This was, I believe, not in debate.

One can certainly "know" if it is invalid; for example, having knowledge of
prior art.

My claim was that PKP had not taken action against PGP.  I did not state that
PKP had never taken action.  This lends credibility to the theory that
PKP does not believe its case could stand up in court, inasmuch as
it leads to the question, why take action against others, but not PGP?

Laws are indeed not "invalid until ruled valid."  They are presumed valid
until ruled otherwise.  This, however, is not the same as being valid until
ruled otherwise.

As to your discussion of whether or not revocations of prior convictions are
retroactive, your points are reasonable, but seem a bit off the topic.

Other than to "vent your spleen", I'm not sure what purpose this posting had.
I have certainly come to the conclusion that those opposed to the use of PGP
seem reticent to discuss it calmly and rationally.  Face it -- name calling
and ad hominem attacks neither win arguments nor "win friends and influence
people".  Ironically, they tend to turn people against you.

P.S. -- Since there is little, if any substantive posting on sci.crypt, I am
        unsubscribing for the moment.  I would like to point out, however,
        that I have never even used PGP.

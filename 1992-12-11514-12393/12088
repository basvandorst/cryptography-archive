Mr. Sternlight:

Jyrki may not be an American native or citizen, but he has a grasp of U.S.
law and history that probably would put him in the 95th percentile of
U.S. citizens.  He is not at all anti-American, just anti-American government
-- a position which is both sensible and admirable.

You have just lost what little credibility you may have had with me.

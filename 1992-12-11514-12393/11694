I guess you

Ge, thanks for explaining! And I was sure they are there

And what sense would a hexadecimal number prepended to an
encrypted (hexadecimal) data make to an eavesdropper?

I do, since it can increase security via making it 
"unprovable" that the message is encrypted/created
my PGP. Yes, this will prohibit one from simply
piping the whole message through PGP and 
getting plaintext. Well, it depends
on which concern is bigger - to
have to strip head/tail off
the arriving e-mail,  or
fear to get caught with 
using "guerilla" PGP... (:-)

It depends. For me, PGP-2.1 is perfectly convenient and nice.
If only it didn't advertise itself so loudly with "---BEGIN"... (:-)

What was the significance of Coventry in cryptographic 
history?   It shows that an adversary can safeguard their 
secrets with the home team, long after the adversary has been 
totally compromised.  The German Luftwaffe was free to bomb 
Coventry and kill British citizens despite the British 
Intelligence Service's possession of a complete decrypt of their 
plans.  I wonder how many Coventrys are occurring today, even 
with knowledge of silicon warfare, value-based cryptography, 
and value-based normative empathetic warfare.  The greatest 
danger in giving new ideas to a secret organization, is that the 
new ideas will sit idle in some bureaucrat's file cabinet, 
gathering dust, while good people die in battlefields and dark 
alleys  across the globe.  The way to prevent this from 
happening is to make sure that the ideas are transmitted on a 
"risky" medium, so that the transmission is considered "hot", 
and the transmitter is never fully and completely investigated.  
If the British had had a fire under their collective behinds, and 
felt that despite allowing Coventry to be bombed, someone might 
tell the Germans all about the whereabouts of the missing 
enigma, then perhaps the British would have saved their fellow 
countrymen, on the grounds that the beans might be spilled 
anyway.   This is the tactic to use when presenting new 
technology to a secret organization.

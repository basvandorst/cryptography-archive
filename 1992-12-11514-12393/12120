As a few people have requested, here's my current bibliography of DES
source code listings found in various widely published books or
magazines. Note that I have explicitly excluded the dozens of books
and publications that merely *describe* the DES algorithm -- even
descriptions complete enough to use as a basis for implementation.
They don't count because, as we all know, only Americans are smart
enough to turn an algorithm description into C code (or so our
government believes.)

Additions or corrections to this list are welcome. Again, I'm only
interested in actual code listings.  --Phil

PS. Mr. Sternlight is welcome to call his local US Attorney and demand
prosecution of any of the authors or publishers listed here for ITAR
violations. Dave, please report back here on the success of your efforts.

I guess you never read the docs. Those "betraying tags" have a purpose
-- they allow the system to automatically find the beginning and end
of messages. You can feed mail messages into PGP without even
stripping the headers. Its all very well engineered, and the feds can
tell you are using PGP anyway by looking at the magic numbers in the
Radix 64 text. I don't think there is any point in stripping them,
since it adds no security for you and will make the program a lot more
inconvenient to use. Its inconvenient enough already....

Jyrki (apt name) posts another anti-U.S. screed in which he says that
I must have been referring to violence done by the U.S. government
when I talk about lives lost or saved by cryptography during the war.

I was not. I was talking about lives lost at Pearl Harbor, lives
saved at Midway, and lives saved by Enigma and Purple decrypts, among many
others.

This is not the first time Jyrki has ignored the facts in order to flog
his anti-American views, and it will doubtless not be the last.

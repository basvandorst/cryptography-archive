E(m) = m for as many as k messages where
   k = [1+gcd(e-1,p-1)]*[1+gcd(e-1,q-1)].

The smallest value k=[1+2]*[1+2]=9 as pointed out. This is because
   gcd(e-1,p-1) >= 2 
since p and e are odd numbers; p is prime, and gcd(e,(p-1)(q-1))=1 and
thus e is odd.

Thus, you want gcd(e-1,p-1) and gcd(e-1,q-1) as small as possible.

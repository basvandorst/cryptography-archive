Well, my asking for permissions to use four of internal
routines directly was sent to Mr. Bidzos yesterday.
When/if he responds - I'lllet you all know.

[Yes, I admit: I rather dislike PKP. And you, Mr. D.S.]

In one word - manure.

Again, I dislike RSADSI, but I will publicly apologize here,
if they will give me positive answer. Basically I asked for
three things from Mr. Bidzos:
	1) Permission to use different DES code (with longer
	   key - one realizes, that diff.cryptanalysis isn't
	   practical threat, while exhaustive key search is).

	2) Permission to call four internal routines from the
	   library "rsaref.a" (routines, which perform RSA
	   algorithm).

	3) Permission to add my own implementation of IDEA to
	   RSAREF.

[I expect no objections for 3, probably OK for 1, and likely
 a no-go for 2. Anybody wanna bet? :-]

I'll be happy to be proven wrong, and thus to contribute my
code/work to RSAREF/RIPEM. Condition 2 is a-must for it.

For this either 2.d from RSAREF license must go away, or PKP
must allow somebody (not necessariyl me :-) to access those
four nice routines. It's as simple as that. IDEA is easier
to write, than even to pick a fight with you. (:-)

Uri Blumenthal
RIPEM key wherever you can get it from (:-) [including server]
Any other crypto key - by mutual agreement with my prior permission (:-).
<Disclaimer> I disclaim EVERYTHING. Can I go now? (:-)

It's a substitution cipher with period 143, probably meaning that there
is an 11-byte key and a 13-byte key that get xored/added/etc in some
combintation, though after a ten-minute look at it wasn't immediately
obvious what steps were used.  It also looks possible that the plaintext
might be multiplied by an odd number as part of the encryption.

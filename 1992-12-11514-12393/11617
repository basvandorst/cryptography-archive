Oh, please get a grip.  The work these people are doing gets published at
CRYPTO and AUSCRYPT (among other venues).

Waterloo does have some cryptography work going on, primarily through Ron
Mullin and Scott Vanstone.  As I recall, both Paul van Oorschoot and
Luke O'Connor did/are doing some crypto work for their PhDs.  Interested
folks should write to
	Graduate Advisor
	Department of Combinatorics and Optimization
	University of Waterloo
	Waterloo, Ontario  N2L 3G1
	Canada
It may also be possible to pursue grad work in this area (with the above
people) through the Computer Science department.

Hmmm... I've heard it put this way several times, but I'm wondering...

Assume that they had a patent on the flying disk (aka frisbee).  Now maybe
I'm reading too much into the above statement, but it looks like it would
be ok for me to make something with the same characteristics but market it
as a dog dish.  Now if this were true, is it my fault that people discover
that they can throw my dog dish just like a frisbee?  Am I liable for _their_
use?  Are _they_ liable for _their_ use???  I mean hey, if I want to buy
a dog dish and toss it around like a frisbee, isn't that my right?

Now, what if I used RSA to simply encrypt files -- nothing more.  Is that ok?
If you as a user want to uuencode them and send them off, 
hey, that is your business... and your right (I think?)...
OK, so my program has an option to uuencode them on the fly, and attach
my public key and ...

Another thing that bothers me is that it covers a communications system...
What *exactly* do they mean?  What if I wanted to add RSA code to my kernel's
filesystem code and cause all data on the disk to be encrypted... Is that
a communications system?  Just about anything we do can be interpreted as
communicating...

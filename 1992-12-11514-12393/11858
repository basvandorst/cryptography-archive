Ross Anderson correctly points out that New Zealand isn't part of
Europe. Others have caviled at my use of the term "stolen goods."

These are all legalisms. The point i was making has to do with the
notion of "clean hands." If one creates PGP1.0 in the U.S. as
a violation of somebody's ownership/patent rights, it is 
"contraband" (like that word better for those who quibble to
make what is clearly unethical "right"?). The act of moving
that item to another country where the patents don't apply
(as distinct from programming from scratch in that country)
doesn't alter the fact that the item is tainted. Using that
code in the other country to create a later (2.0) version
(as distinct from programming 2.0 de novo) doesn't change
that the pro0duct is still tainted.

Clearer, now.

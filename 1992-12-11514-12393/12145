Someone mentioned that DES is freely exportable from the US if its
only purpose was for authentication (sorry, I don't have the article
saved).  The claim was made that crypt(3) in Unix parlance is not
usable as an encryption tool, only for password verification.

Anyone who believes this should probably download /etc/passwd by
anon-ftp from black.ox.ac.uk and, while they're about it, get hold of
/src/security/crack41.tar.Z

On my DEC5500, I can encrypt at 300 baud with DEC's crypt().  Using
Michael Glad's UFC code, written outside the US it is true, I can
manage 9600 baud.  Decryption is a bit slower.


In case this attempt at humour is too subtle for some of you, I
suggest you track down a copy of the Berferd paper, also available
from black.ox.ac.uk


Paul (who's in a silly mood because it's almost Xmas and is looking
forward to a two-week break)

Let's try this again.  Do you know they're guilty?  No.  The Government says
so, but last I checked this country allegedly ran its judicial system
_innocent_ until _proven_ guilty.  Thus "accused", or perhaps even "alleged
vermin", not "vermin" might be more appropriate.  Do you have kids?  If one
of them is screaming about something the other's done, do you shoot the "vermin"
in question with an Uzi as your first course of action?  Seems like you might...

No, no, no.  Against _pirates_.  Because there's a specific principle of
international law which holds that any country has jurisdiction to act against
_pirates_.  It's not an issue of expense, it's an issue of whether there's
jurisdiction or not.  Under the New World Order, though, it looks more and more
like there's noone big enough to tell us "no" anymore.  One day perhaps
reality will catch up with us.  I sure hope so.

So, if the Mexican police came and arrested you for violating the _Mexican_
traffic laws while driving quite legally around downtown NYC, that's perfectly
okay, too?  Do you even begin to understand the concept of jurisdiction?  Life
is much simpler when one ignores all the subtle points, isn't it?  All those
nice neat blacks and whites, and hey, you're always right.  How nice.  How
_convenient_.

Ooooooh, you're so manly!  Can I touch your biceps?  Please?

Two plus three is a long stretch from five, when you have no understanding of
mathematics.  So what?

Aww, shucks.  "When they came for the Jews..."; read some Niemoeller.

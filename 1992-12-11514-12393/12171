About his PGP key, essentially states, "I didn't know it was illegal when
I did it."  

As I am very sure you are aware, ignorance of the law is no excuse.  By
your own arguments and and admission, you are a patent infringer who
has probably been noted down in a number of government files which
"are forever," and in danger of being at the hands of some yippies who
are cleverer than you are. 

It has become clear to me that you should get a tall glass full of your
favorite beverage, a copy of Erik Satie's "Vexations," and should simply
cease posting and stare at a blank wall, as your arguments are so ill-
conceived, so poorly worded, and you are so closed to change yourself 
that asking anyone to accept your arguments as a basis for changing
their own beliefs or behavior is clearly laughable.  

ObCrypto: Is there an archive site for old copies of sci.crypt?  I have
been searching for one for two weeks without success.  I am keenly
interested in finding one, and it's not for big brotherish reasons, either.

PGP 2.1 key forthcoming...

Concerning the difficulties of CRC errors in PGP21.ZIP files - I too had the
same problem when FTPing from numerous sites.  PKZIP 1.10 would always give
CRC errors, and the files were corrupted when they were unzipped.  It
appears that version 1.93 Alpha of PKZIP was used to ZIP up PGP 2.1.  WHen I
used 1.93 to unzip it, it worked fine.  PKZIP 1.10 will *NOT* work with the
PGP 2.1 release ZIP files however.

	However, this is essentially blackmail.  Can a state legally refuse
to send money to the Fed in these instances?  Say, for example, Iowa
collecting state income taxes and telling its citizens to send federal income
taxes to a state address instead of to the fed?

	My perusal of the Constitution places little light on this.

Excuse me, but you just pushed one of my hot buttons. There are also
no ISO international standardization efforts for TCP/IP, but that
hasn't kept the Internet from becoming by far the largest packet
switched network in the world. And the supposedly "international
standard" OSI protocols are almost totally ignored, just as they
should be. (There *is* some justice in the world.)

A group of telco bureaucrats who couldn't write a line of C code to
save their lives may spend a dozen years and enjoy many fine lunches
and dinners in the great cities of the world while razing entire
forests to write an incomprehensible document they call an "official
international standard". But that doesn't mean anyone will actually
use it, or that it's even technically sound.

The computer industry has discovered a far more effective and
realistic way to set standards.  First you produce an experimental
product and get it out into the market. Then you revise it as needed
to meet actual customer needs. Once it has stablized and is in
widespread use, only THEN do you codify it as an "official standard".

What a novel concept.

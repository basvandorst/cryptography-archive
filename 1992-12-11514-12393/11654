Stephen G. * Note that the "child  molester" scenario is a non-argument.
             The gov't can always get a  subpoena for the key. The thing
             we are  worried about is  letting the gov't  have access to
             *all* encrypted data at any
                                 = = =


    I just  got off the  phone with the  'non-argument' "child molestor"
    scenario.

    According to  the detective involved in  the case, they have  had no
    luck  (naturally) breaking  the PGP  code. They  are going after the
    'contempt of  court' angle in order  to force the defendent  to give
    them the password.

    Other interesting note.  He spoke with the FBI  about the matter and
    they indicated that they have also run into PGP. Once case involving
    espionage.

    Now, I  do not know  for a fact  that this note  is true. However, I
    have reasonable  assurances that the  child molestor case  is indeed
    true and have no reason to doubt the second.

    I still post the question:

    Since laws will probably be drafted concerning the use of cryptology
    how would you want such a law  to read if you had the opportunity to
    shape it.

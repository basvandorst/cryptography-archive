It is true that I implied that David Sternlight has painted himself into a 
corner, though the sliminess in that post was my query about whether 
Sternlight had a pecuniary motive for his extraordinary stance.

But I have another slimey theory about Sternlight that may repair his
reputation in certain corners. I think that possibly Sternlight is Phillip
Zimmerman posting by another name, and that promotion of PGP is his aim 
after all. What better way to do it than this? 

But even if Sternlight is not Zimmerman I think he is to be applauded for
the service he has done in producing so many staunch PGP supporters. We
can only hope that he continues this ironic crusade, thank him and wish
him well.

Thank you David.

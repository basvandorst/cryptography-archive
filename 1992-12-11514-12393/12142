The law authorizing ITAR (which is not the Munications Act) specifies that
"public domain" technical data about munitions which has already been
published is exportable.  (The dimensions of secret aircraft, for
instance.)  A related law specifies that something "public domain" (defined
as generally available in the US) cannot be restricted material.  Whether
that law covers software for the purposes of ITAR is, indeed, unclear.

I'll ask my sources for details, and post (if this thread hasn't died by
then), probably around 5 January.

>First of all the language of the act I posted makes clear that

You were quoting regulations, not the law itself.  Regulations are
legally binding if they are consistent with the law, but the law did not
define software.  The question is whether the definition of
"restricted" software in a related law applies in the absence specific
language will get to the courts eventually, unless one of the laws is
repealed.

In terms of ITAR, the thread IS about Scientific American.  If the
algorithm description in Scientific American is sufficient to produce the
restricted parts of PGP, then ONLY Scientific American (or R) could be
prosecuted under ITAR.

So that explains why it was published in the US, then:

 Author:         Wright, Peter.

 Title:          Spycatcher : the candid autobiography of a senior intelligence
                   officer / Peter Wright.

 Published:      New York, N.Y., U.S.A. : Viking, 1987.

Having allies seems to be a good way to get secrets out in the open :-)

I have to disappoint you: the final RSAREF license makes it clear,
that in order to access it in any way other than the published
interface, you need a prior permission from PKP. And since
the set of published interfaces is too poor, PGP can't
be rewritten to use it, nor any decent program (SORRY, Mark! :-). 
Also, taking into account the fact, that the word "PGP" causes 
PKP react like a bull seeing red - I don't think it's likely 
PKP allows such a "modification"...

So, thanks to item 2.d of that new license - "their job" is just 
as easy now, as it was before, in one word - impossible.

I doubt those abroad would bother rewriting PGP... Who
would waste their time, and what for?

And you can't include IDEA into RIPEM, because it will require 
modification to RSAREF, and you need prior permission to do it.
So forget it.

Well, of course PKP patent will expire in a few years (:-).

Now, ITAR regulations... But you wouldn't believe how easy
it is to write a crypto code...   So I personally wouldn't
worry too much about ITAR.  Especially dealing with such a
simple algorithm as IDEA... (:-)

It's worth to thanks Mark for his outstanding work, and to ask him
to upgrade RIPEM.  Actually, some of the desired changes are under
consideration, so if y'all folks can convince him, that it's OK to
use some code from  PGP  (key management, message body compression
and such) - we might indeed come up with compatibility. I might do
IDEA for RIPEM (heck, I'm doing it anyway :-)...    But as long as
item 2.d is there - I see no use for RSAREF. [For their DES sucks,
the only thing I really need from them is  RSA implementation, and 
that only because of the patent, until it expires, of course).

The only question left is - what exactly is "reasonable", and
for who? (:-)

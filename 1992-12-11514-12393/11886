Ethically I don't have a problem.  If the government gets to use it for
free because tax-payers paid for the research, then so should I...

I'd be more concerned about your reputation.  I'm sure you've set off a flag
somewhere: "You know that group of no good Yippees that post to 
alt.security.pgp, well I think they have a new leader.  Some guy named
David Sternlight has posted 63 messages in the last 48 hours.  I think
something is going down!"

Agreed if they did it all themselves with their own capital, on their
own time....

So now we've come full circle.  The first post was from a guy that would
have loved to just send RSA(or PKP, whoever) $20.00 to be able to use
PGP "legally" What does he get for trying to be a nice guy?  A bunch of
legal double talk and one huge flame war.... :D

Merry Christmas!

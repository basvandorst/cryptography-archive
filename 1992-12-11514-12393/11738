Greetings.

     I am pretty comfotable with encryption, but I do not really
understand digital signatures.  Could someone reccommend a text to
me that might discuss this subject?  Or, if it is actually something
simple that I've missed, could you alternatively mail me some info.
directly.

     Thanks!

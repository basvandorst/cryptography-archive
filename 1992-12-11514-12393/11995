It's worth mentioning that some of us who use threaded newsreaders
such as trn don't realize how annoying excessive cross-posting is
to others, particularly if we have both the substantive groups
and the irrelevant ones in our active base.

It's more a matter of forming the correct habits than deliberate
offense in most cases. I'm just getting into the habit of checking
the headers when responding to a message, and I'm far from perfect
at it as, I assume, are many others.

Maybe the newsreader software writers should add an extra, optional
question to the dialogue, asking if the writer of a reply wants
to send it to ..... newsgroups, and giving him a chance to correct
the address list.

Or maybe trn and other groups have such a feature, and I just haven't
found it yet.

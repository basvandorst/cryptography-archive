This is the point.  Upper middle class Whites are raised to believe that
Mr. Policeman Is Your Friend.  Upper middle class Whites also make the
laws.  Anyone who is working class or non-White can supply many
counterexamples.

Anyone worried about Government abuse should look at the history of the
Watergate scandal, and see just exactly what President Nixon, Attorney
General Mitchell, and Special Counsel Coulsen *really did*. Breakins.
"Enemy lists".  Contempt citations.  Bribes.  Wiretaps.  "Dirty
tricks".  In the future, we will undoubtedly have leaders who are just
as bad or worse.  (No, this is not a comment on any current politicians
:-).

Note that the "child molester" scenario is a non-argument.  The gov't
can always get a subpoena for the key.  The thing we are worried
about is letting the gov't have access to *all* encrypted data at any
time without notifying the owner of the data.  This is equivalent to
legalized burglary.

Anyway, the best arguement that I can come up with on short notice
is based on the security of the data.

Security in the legal system stinks.  So they put in this big vault with
all the keys in it, and who has to fetch them out?  A minimum wage
clerk.

Note that when a key is fetched by the gov't, it compromises *all* data
encrypted with that key.  A person or business under investigation can
only assume that *all* of their encrypted data has been compromised.
The only solution is to go to "more primitive" ways of protecting data.

To summarize:

1.  The only reason for requiring key registration is to allow the gov't
    *undetected* access to encrypted materials.

2.  When the gov't accesses the information, all information encrypted
    with the registered keys is compromised.

3.  The only safe assumption is that all information encrypted with a
    registered key has been compromised.

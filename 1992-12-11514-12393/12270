If the "process" is encryption of plaintext by a public key, then wouldn't
the "product made by the process" be:

   o The public/private key pair, and
   o Text encrypted by the public key

To cover the code, I would expect the statute to say something like, "product
incorporating the process," or "product making use of the process".  Case law
may have (mistakenly, IMHO) extended the law to include this, but the statute 
listed doesn't seem to say that.

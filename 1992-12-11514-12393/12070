There's a fine line here, but basically, you're wrong.  Patent law
bars the *making*, *selling*, or *use* of the protected invention.
Writing source code, as opposed to writing a book or paper that describes
RSA, would be considered an infringement.  I know that that's a fine line.
That's part of the LPF's argument against algorithmic patents.  Besides,
courts are in the business of drawing fine lines.  And yes, they would
consider context and intent.  For example, if your intent was demonstrably
education and teaching, you'd be fine -- that's part of the intent of
patent law, that others learn of the invention.  If your intent is to
enable others to actually use the invention, you have committed an
infringment.

And no, I'm not going to attempt to rule on other hypothetical or
non-hypothetical situations -- there are lots of reasons I'm not a
lawyer or a judge.  Let's leave it at this -- my intention is purely
educational....  (Besides, we never patented netnews.)

Let's leave the personal attacks out of this.  It cheapens and weakens your
own arguments.

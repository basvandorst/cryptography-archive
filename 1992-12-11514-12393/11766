What's even neater is that the PGP-encrypted message (or
one-time-padded) message can be put into a GIF file, or sound sample,
as the least significant bits (LSBs), and then posted around the world in a
matter of a few hours. (I've experimented with this and it's trivial
to do....just use Adobe Photoshop, open a GIF or whatever, and
manipulate some of the bits. For any real world noisy images (noise
down near the LSBs), the message bits are indistinguishable from image bits.)

Nobody (except the sender and recipient) knows the LSB bits are
actually message bits, and nobody knows who's getting the News feed!
The perfect "digital dead drop." A single DAT audio tape can carry 80
megabytes of stuff just in  the LSBs.

The task of spycatchers is rapidly becoming hopeless. No more messages

 Hi there.  I just got a copy of the cbw program.  I really like it and
it seems to have have a lot of power, but it also seems to require a bit
of skill and experience.  I would be curious to hear from others who are 
using this and learn some techniques.  In addition, I would like to know
if there are other programs out there for breaking encrypted files.  (the
cbw program works with files created under unix crypt)

  Thanks...

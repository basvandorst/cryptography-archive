I would humbly submit that the amount of ethicizing and sanctimony on
the subject of the legality of PGP has exceeded all reason, that all
points have been made at least twice, and the level of discussion
now resembles the yowling of tomcats more than scientific or
even technological discussion.

All you people, take a chill pill.   Please.

ObCrypt:  Can anybody please abstract the meat of this Lucas article in Dobbs'?

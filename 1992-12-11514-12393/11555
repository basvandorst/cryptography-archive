Are there text books available on the subject of cryptography? I am
thinking of something that would start with the basics and work up to
modern day systems.  Something that would show both how to create your
own crypto systems and how to defeat a given system.  Things like how
do you analyze the algorithm, etc.

As a side, are there any universities with emphasis in the crypto area
in either math or computer science programs?  Or do most people just
read the literature and self-study?

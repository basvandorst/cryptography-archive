Ok so I understand now how the RSA system works, I am sure others have already asked
but what is the best way to attack it?

Lets say we were encoding only using RSA and I can get the source to encode any number
I like, and I know public key and modulus. What is the best line of attack? Getting it
to encode numbers such as 2,4,8 etc?

Also how long are the predicted times to break keys such as 256 bit or 1024 bit?

Does anyone have a reference or references for primitive polynomials
of order >40. Am needing very reliable burst-error detection. Also,
references on burst-error detection techniques would be useful. Esp.
interested in evaluating how effective a prim. polynomial of order N
is for burst-error detection.

Many thanks - George Bolt

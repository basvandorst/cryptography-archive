  'Secure' is relative.  DVP is 'secure' from me breaking it, 'secure' from
Willie the corner crack dealer from breaking it, but NOT 'secure' from the
Cali Cartel, or from a technologically sophisticated nation.
 
   For these reasons, DVP & even DES are stated to offer a level of
protection to sensitive, but unclassified information.

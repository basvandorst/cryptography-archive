Try the United States -- specifically, the 21st amendment to the United States
Constitution, which expressly makes it legal to manufacture, transport, and
sell intoxicating liquors in the US, except as restricted by state law. 
Suppose a ship carrying Kentucky's finest bound for Europe (with the newly
relaxed trade tariffs) were seized on the high seas by a Middle Eastern
nation wherein consumption of alcohol was strictly verbotem.  Now, further
suppose the ship's crew were taken back to that nation, tried, found guilty,
and sentenced to be jailed for life.

Is this justice?

How is this tangibly different from the scenerio that has been previously
reported here?

nobody@nowhere.mil (in other words somebody who's hiding--perhaps
because he has something to hide) calls attention to my PGP
signature floating around.

This signature was created when I first saw PGP, and before I
had a conversation with Jim Bidzos, who convinced me of the
illegality of PGP in the U.S.

I no longer use PGP and the signature is no longer valid. When
PGP becomes permissible in the U.S., perhaps through one of the
mechanisms I suggested in a recent post, I will have a PGP signature
again.

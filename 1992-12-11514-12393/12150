If they go after someone big, they have more of a risk of losing
everything.  In the case of the Feds, the entire ITAR restrictions on
software (as they apply to public domain software) are unlikely to survive
a Constitutional test.  In the case of PKP, they could lose the patent if
they go after someone with enough money to defend the case.

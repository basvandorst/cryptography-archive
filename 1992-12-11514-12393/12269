What a good idea! I'm tired of all this political trash, furthermore
I'm outside the US and I don't like listening all the time to the risks
of using a patented algorithm, to the risks of looking at a patented
algorithm, to the incredible risks of even messing with a patented algoritmh
when living in the US. ``Cryptography == Weapon == Illegal'' for some
people, but I cannot stand this  absurdity any more.

Regards,
David

PS:
	The correct equation would be:
	
	``Cryptography == Privacy == Lack of control by government''
		==>
	``Crypto must be declared illegal to discourage its diffusion''

	Let's not make things more complicated.

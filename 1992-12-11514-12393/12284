Well, David, I'm glad you feel I have integrity behind my statement, I
suppose it comes from a sense, in which I feel that my whole life is a
form of protest.  As a gay male living in this country, I feel like
every moment since I cam out 4 plus years ago has been a protest to get
the rights I deserve.

I wish that I had the financial capability to stand behind my position
here, but I don't at present.  But, that doesn't dampen my enthusiasm
or the integrity of my statement, it just means that I can't afford to
participate in the "system" which we are forced to live in.

A system, which I might add, allows my bosses in almost every locality
in the United States to fire me and use as a reason, "Well, I don't want
any faggots working here."   Bleahg.  I have too many battles which are
so deeply connected to my life to fight, but I see this as a related
one, the right to privacy is essential.  And by holding a copy of pgp, I
can voice my protest.

So, now, with all that lifted off my shoulder in an unloading of a year
of anger and hostility towards this country, I do feel better.  I would
however, love to help someone organize a challenge against the munitions
act and PKP patent.

-Erik

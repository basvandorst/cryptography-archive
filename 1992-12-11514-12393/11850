ripem uses an RSA-licensed version of RSAREF. The license is very liberal
as long as ripem is used for private, non-commercial purposes.

In their correspondence with me and others, RSA is encouraging use
of ripem for people who wish a private, non-commercial privacy-enhanced
mail system, as well as any other system that uses RSAREF under license.

ripem will be out very soon--my personal guess is by year-end, though
I don't speak for the programmer.

These remarks apply to the U.S. and Canada. ripem, since it uses RSA
and DES, will come under the same export controls that RSA and DES
do.

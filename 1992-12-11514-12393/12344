I don't remember hearing such an assertion.

My opinion is divided; it looks like it's SLIGHTLY stronger than RSA,
but not fundamentally so.

It beats ONE attack on a naive implementation of an RSA message
protocol.

However, from what I can tell, only a stupid implementation would be
particularly susceptible to such an attack.

It's been said time and time again here that it's not JUST the
encryption algorithm that's important; the WHOLE messaging system has
got to be strong.  And with even a half-hearted set of messaging
protocols, the attack shouldn't be effective.  All you need do is add
some random salt (or an MD5 signature) to the message before
re-encrypting, and the weakness is covered.

The "problem" with the Lucas system, from what I can tell, is that
it's not evident that it's FUNDAMENTALLY stronger than RSA.  It still
stands or falls based on the assumption that it is very difficult to
factor the product of two enormous prime numbers.

I would have been much more excited if LUC involved some OTHER
hard-to-reverse operation rather than prime factoring.

Supposing some prime-factoring algorithm comes out next week that
kills RSA, LUC would become similarly useless.  I don't foresee such
an algorithm coming, but certainly it WOULD kill 'em both.

I'd like to see other more fundamental advantages to LUC; there was a
claim in the article that it might be faster than RSA, which would
qualify.  There might be other advantages that make it harder to
break.  I'd love to hear about it.

Bull. I would gladly pay Public Key Partners for a license for their
patent so I can use PGP. They will not grant me or anyone else a
license, and I don't feel safe with any other software. I doubt that
their patent is valid, but I'm willing to part with $20 or $50 or even
$100 for a personal license to use RSA any way I like, if only so I
won't be in a legally ambiguous state. Thus, you can't argue that I'm
"violating the law for pecuniary advantage", as I'm willing to forgo
any pecuniary advantage. The issue here IS freedom, pure and simple.
Public key cryptography is one of the most important ways around to
protect your privacy, and I will not do without it. I suspect most
other people on the net feel the same way.

You doubtless intended your last comment sarcastically, but I believe it to
be actually true.  And we wonder why we Americans come off as imperialists.

The trouble is, not everyone agrees with either our laws or our methods.  It may
frustrate you that we ought to wait until criminals commit crimes in the US
against US citizens before we arrest them, but that is the practical reality,
if we want to be ourselves safe and secure on the high seas.

How about this one, written by your counter-part who is from any country 
that cuts off the hands of adulterers:

"  Of course, none of those adulterers going to the (country next door)
 will perform their evil deeds with our wives.  But wait!  If the penalties 
 are less in the (country next door), why should they not ship our wives there?  
 Less risk and surely worth the modest extra expense.

   I heard it said here, my neighbor's risks are not my own, so turn and look 
 the other way.  Protecting their wives' morality is not my job.  Hmph, I say; 
 cut off all of their hands and the devil take the technicalities."

I am not in favor of adultery.  I am pointing out that it is cloud-cuckoo
land to assume, world-wide, that justice, morality, and ideas of crime and
punishment is anything like uniform.  You are assuming a _lot_ about
the view outsiders have of our criminal justice system.  There are other
societies who think drugs should have smaller penalties and, say, adultery should
have much larger penalties.  It is the _penalty_ for the crime that is at issue
here.  People should not have to live in fear of a police force of a country
with _totally_ different ideas of punishment and crime if they never go there.  
There's over 100 countries, for heaven's sake.  That's the real world,
and only our drug histeria does not make this obvious.  Pick any lesser crime
you like.  It's probably 90 days for spitting in the street somewhere in this
wide world of ours.  That may sound mild, but there are also countries (sometimes
including ours) where people who are different from the majority group can expect
periodic beatings in jail.

Also, if you are not white
and male, and certainly if you are not a US citizen, I think you may have the
same view of US justice as many of us do of criminal justice systems that think
hacking off hands for adultery is just fine.

You are also implicitly willing to sacrifice an arbitrary number of your own
citizens to the tender mercies of foreign criminal justice systems for doing
things that in America are misdemeanors at best.  Many such systems are 
breath-takingly corrupt and unfair by American standards.  What goes
around comes around.

This is not a high morality position.  It is a practical position that is much
more likely to affect _those of us here reading the posts_ than it is to protect
drug dealers who, after all, have to come to the US sooner or later anyway.
(If you think on this long enough, the idea of grabbing folks on the high seas
is just another admission that we can't win the drug war at home).

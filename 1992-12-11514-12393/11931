     It may have some code
   "contaminated" with some RSA code, in violation of copyright and/or trade
   secret. 

I have never seen this claim before.  Could you elaborate?   PKP
alleges that Zimmerman may have stolen ideas from MailSafe because he
had a copy in 1986, but that is extremely debatable (and Zimmerman
denies it.)

pgp 2.x does contain RSADSI code for the MD5 digest algorithm.  This
code is licensed to all under very generous terms (you have to mention
that your code contains RSADSI's code or is derived from it.)

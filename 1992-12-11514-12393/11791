   This description sounds suspiciously like many MS-DOS viruses.  I suspect
   that it will be equally popular.
   If the CPU can execute it, it can be disassembled.

   ....
   So who says the OS lets the application do self-modifying code?  Or
   read its own code?  And the debug monitor can disable the checking code 
   when the program enters the "contact host & verify" routine, and put it 

You can *always* build self-modifying code -- use an interpreter,
and include the real program as data -- as long as performance
isn't too critical.  If you only need a couple of MIPS of CPU,
and you've got a RISC or 486/50 or DSP processor, you can write
the program as p-code or LISP or (shudder) BASIC or Forth,
or roll your own interpretive system which is more amenable to
running scrambled.  Still don't know if you can solve the problem,
but at least you've got another tool.

I can tell you about two countries.

The Netherlands:

	It is legal. There are also laws that protect individual privacy against  
(government) infringement. There is one person at the justice department currently  
researching the issue.

France:

	A law has been passed, stating you need a permit to use cryptohgraphic  
soft- or hardware. But the law is not in effect yet, because they still have been  
unable to think of a workable scheme to implement it. So currently, it is legal,  
but it might become illegal as soon as the implementation has been arranged.

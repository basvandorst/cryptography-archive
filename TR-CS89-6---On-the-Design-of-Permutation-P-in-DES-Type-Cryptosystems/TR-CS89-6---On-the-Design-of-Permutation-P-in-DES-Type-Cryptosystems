        This paper reviews some possible design  criteria  for  the
        permutation  P  in a DES style cryptosystem. These permuta-
        tions provide the diffusion component  in  a  substitution-
        permutation  network.   Some  empirical rules which seem to
        account for the derivation of the permutation used  in  the
        DES are first presented. Then it is noted that these permu-
        tations may be regarded as  latin-squares  which  link  the
        outputs  of  S-boxes  to  their inputs at the next stage. A
        subset of these with an extremely  regular  structure,  and
        which  perform  well  in  a  dependency  analysis  are then
        presented and suggested for use in future schemes  of  both
        current and extended versions of the DES.

    1.  Introduction

         The Data Encryption Standard (DES) [NBS77]  is  currently  the
    only  certified  encryption standard. It has achieved wide utiliza-
    tion, particularly in the banking  and  electronic  funds  transfer
    areas, and is an Australian standard [ASA85] among others.

         However at the time of its introduction, there was a consider-
    able  amount  of  controversy both due to the classification of its
    design criteria, and with the choice of a 56-bit key as  being  too
    small [DiH77], [Hel79].  However, on all other accounts DES appears
    to be an excellent cryptosystem. No short-cuts have been  found  to
    aid  in the cryptanalysis of DES other than by exhaustive key-space
    search. With the current significant  use  of  DES  (especially  in
    banking),  there  is  interest in designing and building a DES-type
    cryptosystem with an extended key length.

         In Brown [Bro89], the design criteria used in  the  DES,  both
    those  reported  in  the literature, and those noted by the author,
    were discussed.  This paper further considers  the  design  of  the
    permutation  box  P,  which  provides  the diffusion component of a
    substitution-permutation network in DES  type  cryptosystems.  Such
    systems  were  original devised by Shannon [Sha49], who termed this
    arrangement a mixing transformation. The S-boxes provided confusion
    of  the input, and the P-boxes provided diffusion of the S-box out-
    puts across the inputs to the next stage.  Two  key  properties  of
    such S-P networks are the avalanche property, identified by Feistel
    [Fei73]; and the  completeness  property,  identified  by  Kam  and
    Davida  [KaD79].  They ensure that every output bit becomes a func-
    tion of each input bit in as few rounds as possible. Meyer  [Mey78]

    (also  in  [MeM82])  has  quantified  this property for the DES, by
    showing that after 5 rounds, every output bit is a function of  all
    input bits.  The authors have used this form of analysis as a meas-
    ure of effectiveness  in  the  design  of  permutation  P.   It  is
    intended  that as a result of this work, the design of the permuta-
    tion P in an extended DES  style  scheme  may  be  performed  on  a
    sounder theoretical basis.

    2.  Current P-box Design Criteria

         The central component of the DES cryptosystem is the  function
    g.   It  is a composition of an expansion function E which provides
    an autoclave function, eight substitution boxes (S-boxes)  S  which
    confuse  the  input bits, and then permutation P which diffuses the
    outputs from each S-box to the inputs of a number of S-boxes in the
    next  stage.  A more detailed description of these functions may be
    found in [NBS77], [ASA85] or [SeP89].  For  the  purposes  of  this
    analysis,  it  is  convenient  to regard the DES as a 48-bit mixing
    function, as detailed in Davio et al [DDF83], which emphasizes  the
    analysis  of  the  functional composition P.S.E.  In Brown [Bro89],
    the following analysis of, and design rules for, permutation P were
    derived by analysing this S.P.E functional composition, which forms
    one round of the S-P network:

                  R(i) = L(i-1) O+ P(S(E(R(i-1)) O+ K(i))).


         The input of permutation P may be divided into  4-bit  outputs
    from the eight S-boxes, and the output from E is divided into 6-bit
    inputs to the eight S-boxes at the next stage.  Instead of express-
    ing  this  permutation in terms of bit positions, it may be written
    in terms of which S-box output is connected by P.E  to  each  input
    bit  of  the S-boxes at the next stage (see Table 1).  Provided the
    S-boxes fulfil their design requirements, it may  be  assumed  that
    all  S-box  outputs are equivalent, and that the inputs may be con-
    sidered as three pairs ab cd and  ef.

    From this the authors noted that permutation P ensures that:

    o+ 1  each of the S-box input bits ab cd ef come from the outputs of
         different S-boxes.

    o+ 2  none of the input bits ab cd ef to a given  S-box  S(i)  comes
         from the output of that same S-box S(i).

    o+ 3  an output from S(i-1) goes to one of  the  ef  input  bits  of
         S(i), and hence via E an output from S(i-2) goes to one of the
         ab input bits.

    o+ 4  an output from S(i+1) goes to one of  the  cd  input  bits  of
         S(i).

    o+ 5  for each S-box output, two bits go to ab or ef input bits, the
         other two go to cd input bits as noted in [Dav82].

         These rules all appear consistent with the  implementation  of
    the  avalanche and completeness effects by ensuring that every out-
    put bit becomes a function of each input bit in as  few  rounds  as
    possible.

         Permutations satisfying these criteria have been generated.  A
    total  of  178  permutations were found, from 96 possible exclusion
    sets (the mandatory wirings required by rules 3 and  4  were  arbi-
    trarily  assigned  to  bits c and e/a respectively).  Each of these
    permutations could generate a number of  possible  permutations  by
    swapping  the order of bits in each of the pairs ab, cd, and ef; or
    by rearranging the order of the four output bits from  each  S-box.
    However,  the authors believe these variations are not significant,
    and note that they do not  change  the  result  of  the  dependency
    analysis.   Davies  [Dav82]  and  Davio  et  al  [DDF83]  have also
    observed that a functionly  equivalent  S.P.E  combination  can  be
    formed  by rearranging the order of the S-box output bits (by rear-
    ranging columns), and by then altering permutation P to compensate.

         To provide a measure of the effectiveness of the derived  per-
    mutations,  Meyer's  analysis [Mey78], [MeM82] of ciphertext depen-
    dence on plaintext bits was extended for these newly derived permu-
    tations.   Briefly, following Meyer, this analysis may be described
    as follows.  To provide a measure of this dependency, a 64*64 array
    G     is formed. Each element G   (i,j) of which specifies a depen-
    dae,nbcy of output bit X(j) on inpau,tbbit X(i), between rounds a and b.
    The number of marked elements in G    indicates the degree to which
    complete dependence was  achieved 0,bry  round  r.   Details  of  the
    derivation  of this matrix, and the means by which entries are pro-
    pagated, may be  found  in  [MeM82].   The  authors  repeated  this
    analysis  for the current DES, and extended it by analysing each of
    the 178 empirically generated permutations, as well  as  the  worst
    case  P (see Table 2), with results as shown in columns 2, 3, and 6
    of Table 3.

    3.  Further Analysis of the Design of Permutation P

         On closer examination, it was  noted  that  these  empirically
    derived  rules  for the design of permutation P, when written as in
    Table 1, actually result in a latin square.  Note that the permuta-
    tion  P  used  in the current DES is not a latin square, however it
    may be transformed into one by selectively swapping some ab/ef  and
    cd  pairs  to align the highlighted values in Table 1 into the same
    columns.  This transformation makes no difference to the dependency
    result  obtained.   A  latin square is a square of numbers in which
    each number occurs exactly once in each row and  each  column  (see
    [DeK74]).   Such a result cannot be accidental, and must be related
    to the desired properties of permutation P, namely to provide maxi-
    mal  diffusion among the S-boxes. In order to explore this further,
    some possible permutations which could be used in a DES  type  sys-
    tem, and which form a latin-square when written as specified above,
    were generated. A sample space of  657096  such  permutations  were
    generated.  These  were  analysed  for  effectiveness using Meyer's
    ciphertext dependence on plaintext, with results as  summarized  in
    column 4 of Table 3.

         The P-box used in the current DES has  a  propagation  profile
    that  falls  fairly  close to to the median of the 178 permutations
    generated by my empirical rules.  It thus appears to  be  a  fairly
    representative  example  of  them.  In turn, these also fall within
    the range found for the permutations  derived  from  latin-squares,
    which  obviously  encompass the criteria needed to design them.  In
    conjunction with the substantially inferior profile  of  the  worst
    case P-box, this provides a strong indication that the design rules
    identified are comprehensive, at least as far as this aspect of the
    P-box design is concerned.

    4.  Analysis of the Best Latin-Square Permutations P

         From the sample space of 657096 permutations, those  resulting
    in  the  highest  percentage values in the dependency analysis were
    extracted, a total of 20.   When  examined,  half  of  the  columns
    (namely  the  ab/ef columns) of these permutations were found to be
    identical, with values as given in Table 4.  These columns  provide
    inputs  to  two S-boxes due to expansion function E.  Further, they
    were found to be nearly identical to the values generated by apply-
    ing a difference function of

        [-2 +1 c d -1 +2]       c, d arbitary                     (4.1)

    to the input S-box number, as shown in full in Table 4.

         From this, the authors  suggested  that  permutations  with  a
    fixed  ab/ef  column  structure whose values are those generated by
    difference function (4.1) may perform well.  Permutations  of  this
    form  were  generated,  a total of 264 being found.  The results of
    the dependency analysis on these permutations is given in column  5
    of  Table  3.  Those providing the best results were extracted, 100
    being found.  These were found to be grouped into pairs, with  only
    columns  c  and d interchanged. These pairs in turn were grouped by
    exclusion set (the set of values not used as inputs to each S-box).
    The  only difference between them is the swapping of some of the cd
    bits, a transformation which makes no difference to the  dependency
    results.   A  total  of 18 exclusion sets were found among the best
    permutations, and a sample from each is given in Table 5.

         The authors noted that among these permutations are two  which
    may be generated with difference functions

        [-2 +1 +4 -3 -1 +2],    and                               (4.2)


        [-2 +1 +3 +4 -1 +2]                                       (4.3)

    being the first and last entries in Table  5  respectively.   These
    would,  the authors believe, be a good choice for implementation in
    a practical scheme because of their regular structure.

    5.  A Regular Form for Permutation P

         As further confirmation of this  result,  all  permutations  P
    which  have  the  form of a difference function on the target S-box
    were constructed,  120  being  found.  There  cipher-plaintext  bit
    dependency propogation is given in Table 3. The 8 best of these are
    indeed the regular permutations formed using the  difference  func-
    tions  (4.2)  and  (4.3),  and their equivalents formed by swapping
    ab/ef or cd columns. They are listed in Table  6.   These  permuta-
    tions  would  thus seem to be excellent candidates for any reimple-
    mentation of the DES using 64-bit blocks.

    6.  Regular Permutations P in An Extended DES

         Permutations of this form were then generated for an  extended
    DES using 128-bit blocks. The 4 best of these were produced using a

    difference function

        [-2 +1 -7 +7 -1 +2]                                       (6.1)

    and its equivalents by column swapping, as shown in Table  7.   The
    cipher-plaintext  dependency  results  are  given in Table 8 (along
    with those for a worst case, and sample  permutations  given  in  a
    previous  paper [Bro89]).  These best permutations, and they alone,
    resulted in complete dependency of ciphertext bits on all plaintext
    bits  in  5  rounds,  the same as for the current size scheme. Thus
    these permutations would seem to be excellent candidates for use in
    our proposed extended scheme.

    7.  Conclusion

         A set of empirical design rules for the permutaion P in a  DES
    style  cryptosystem is descibed. It is then noted that permutations
    generated according to these rules are all  latin-squares.  When  a
    sample of these latin-square permutations were generated, they were
    found to span those generated using the empirical rules.  The  best
    of  these  permutations  suggested that permutations having a fixed
    column structure as generated by difference  function  (4.1)  would
    perform  optimally.   Permutations  with  this  structure were gen-
    erated, and the best of these analysed. They were found to  include
    the  permutations  generated  using  difference functions (4.2) and
    (4.3), which are suggested for use in practical  DES  type  schemes
    because  of  their  regularity. An extension of these results to an
    extended DES was  then  analysed,  and  4  permutations  formed  by
    difference  function (6.1) were found to result in complete cipher-
    text dependency on plaintext bits after 5 rounds, a result that  is
    the  same  as  with the current size scheme.  Such permutations are
    thus suggested for use in any extended schemes.

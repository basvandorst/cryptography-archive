Why would they want a truly random source?  Stream ciphers require that
the same "random" sequence be known at both ends of the link; something
not possible with a realtime hardware random source.

(I know, the chip collects a bunch of random numbers, compresses them,
encrypts (with seed values), and transmits them!  :-)

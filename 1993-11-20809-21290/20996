This ought to go in the FAQ. BTW, if you have bothered to review the
postings to this newsgroup just a few days ago, you would have found
the answer to your question.

To answer your questions:

1) Description. It is in the file APPNOTE.TXT that comes with the
PKZIP package. This file has been omited in the distribution of
version 2.04x, but is still available from PKWare - check on their
BBS. However, the algorithm is the same as in version 1.1, with some
minor implementation improvements to make a dictionaryy attack more
difficult.

2) Security. I have seen no serious cryptanalysis of the algorithm and
don't know anybody who can break it. According to some people who have
researched it, with some files and in some modes of compression, there
is enough known plaintext to make it weaker. NSA has allowed its
export from the USA, so draw your own conclusions about its
"security". There are several ZIP crackers available, but all of them
are limited to short and simple passwords. If you decide to rely on
this encryption algorithm, make sure that you select a password that
is at least 8 characters long and contains a mixture of upper-,
lower-case letters, digits and punctuation characters.

Vesselin

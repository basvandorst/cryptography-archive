  At a short talk to a user's group meeting on Wednesday, I reiterated the
  claim that PGP is the most secure encryption program available for
  users of pc that exists. I would love to have someone seriously dispute
  this claim, but continuing evidence such as Peter's {concerning Norton's
  [In]Diskreet} keeps strengthening it.
 
Given two PC encryption programs, each of which is assumed to generate
random-appearing ciphertext, how does one judge one of them "more secure"
than the other?
 
Even if full details of the encryption algorithms are known, how does
one decide which is "more secure"?
 
If one cannot provide criteria for determining when one program is
"more secure" than another then it does not make sense to ask which
is the "most secure".
 
Brute force attacks upon a cryptosystem can be compared since the
average time required by a brute force attack is half the size of
the key space multiplied by the time required to test each key.
But cryptosystems are not judged secure or insecure solely by this
measure.
 
I suppose that, in general, the security of an encryption program can
only be measured by its resistance to actual attempts to break it.
Those that have been broken are obviously insecure.  But since even
the allegedly amateurish cryptosystem of the Computer Shopper challenge
seems to have resisted so far the efforts of the sci.crypt readership
to break it, it's likely that, for most PC encryption programs (at
least those which do not implement DES in one of its modes), the levels
of security provided will remain largely unknown.

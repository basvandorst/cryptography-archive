   0 XOR 0 = 0   1 XOR 0 = 1
   0 XOR 1 = 1   1 XOR 1 = 0

or more generally,
                           _
   0 XOR ? = ?   1 XOR ? = ?

If the first bits above are your message bits, and the second are the
one-time pad (OTP) bits, then you can see that the output will be as
well-distributed as the OTP.  In other words,
                                        ______
   predictable XOR random --> random || random --> random

It really doesn't matter what the message looks like, the output will
appear random (as random as the OTP).

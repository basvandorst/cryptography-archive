I wrote to the person who's producing this and asked him if I could post his
reply, I've included his message below.  It sounds like an improved variant of
the noise-in-a-zener type generator I posted here some months ago (he uses two
of them and sends the output at 9600bps to a computer via its RS232 port).  It
seems to be a nice off-the-shelf solution to generating random numbers, even if
it is a bit expensive.

Random Number Generator
 
This new random number generator has a low power consumption which enables the
device to draw its power from any RS-232 port. The RNG produces random bytes
with a frequency of about 960 bytes per second.
 
The device consists of two analog random noise systems (thermal noise in an
electronic components) which are combined into a single stream of random bits.
These are fed into a shiftregister. A low cost / low power custom solution is
used to transfer the resulting random byte to the RS-232 port.
 
Each device is separately tested and comes with software for MacIntosh and
DOS/Windows systems.
 
Commercial price single unit: $195, -excl shipping (incl. software)
 
Reduction is possible for larger quantities.

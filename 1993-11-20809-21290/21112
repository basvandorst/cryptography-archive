Since when do you believe marketing claims? PKWare are the same folks
who claim that the -AV codes in PKZIP provide authentication
(actually, they can be broken in a minute), and who claim that the
"professional" version of PKLite produces files that cannot be
uncompressed (actually, many third-party decompressors for such files
exist). Just don't trust them when it comes to security.

Regarding the encryption, the situation is as I stated it. They
changed the verification number from two to one bytes, which makes
brute force attacks more difficult. This is the whole "significant
improvement" and it has been introduced only after the advice from the
folks who created Info-ZIP.

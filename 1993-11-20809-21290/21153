  No, there are several reasons for a combined system.  RSA is used to
provide a public key system, but it is (relatively) weak to known
plaintext attacks.  If I guess what the message is, it takes little
effort to confirm it.  But in PGP, the RSA encrypted message is
(relatively random) IDEA key.  IDEA, while not having a public key
capability, is faster than RSA and safer against known plaintext, so
encrypting the key with RSA and the message with IDEA makes for a
better system than either used separately.

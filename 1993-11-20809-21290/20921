Hello Kathryn.  I know that at The University of Western Ontario's
Law School, several courses in the law are taught with materials that
are compiled by the professor.  These compilations are usually 
photocopied just enough times for each student to have a copy, and
much of the explanation occurs only in class.

I'm pretty sure that most law schools have at least one course in
information and the law (I could be wrong), and whoever teaches
this course in a law school close to you is probably your best
resource.  At the University of Western Ontario, the professor
the course in 'information and the law' is taught by one
Professor M.A. Wilkinson.  She is a professor of law who is
currently pursuing a Ph.D. in information science at Western.
I don't know her e-mail address, but I believe that her postal
address is: Faculty of Law
            The University of Western Ontario
            London, Ontario
            CANADA  N6A 3K7

My impression is that you are looking for papers by legal
scholars.  She should be able to point you in the right direction.

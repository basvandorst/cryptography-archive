IDEA is a block cipher similar in spirit to DES but with 128 bit keys
and different internal operation.  The original paper by Lai and Massey
was in Crypto 90.  There is a less technical article about it by
(I think) sci.crypt's own Bruce Schneier in the current Dr. Dobbs.
You can find source code for it as part of PGP.

IDEA is patented and generally can't be used commercially without
paying off some Swiss company.  I haven't seen any technical arguments
that it's harder to break than triple DES, although carefully coded
IDEA implementations tend to run faster than even single DES.
Certainly, IDEA hasn't withstood nearly the amount of attempted
cryptanalysis as DES.  As to whether IDEA is really hard to break, no
one who knows is telling.  I currently think of triple DES as a more
conservative choice (as well as being patent free), but I'm not a real
expert.

I agree that replaying a password within one or two display intervals is
difficult if not automated. Will you agree that it is easy if it is
automated? I know how to automate it, and I'm sure lots of others do too.

The real point is that user accountability is lost due to the POSSIBILITY
of replay during the window of validity. It's called "plausible
denyability". Making up for this vulnerabily is near impossible if you
are relying on time-dependent authenticators on a large network.

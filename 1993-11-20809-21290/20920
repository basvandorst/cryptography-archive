i'm in the process of working on a project about the legal issues 
involved in using encryption technology to protect email and other 
electroic data for a graduate course in legal aspects of information 
handling.

i've been running up against a brick wall in my attempts to find 
_scholarly_ articles about the privacy rights and encryption; i can find 
tons of one-page editorials (which aren't gonna cut it as sources for a 
research paper) and lots of technical information (but the paper isn't 
about the technical aspects).  i've gone through the online materials at 
the eff gopher site, read the sci.crypt faq, scoured the library (things 
like _privacy journal_ don't deal with any of this in the depth that i 
need), etc etc etc, to no avail.

if any of you have any suggestions as to where i might find more 
scholarly information along the lines i need, please let me know.  i'm 
really excited about getting the project rolling, but i'm starting to get 
frustrated at the lack of resources available to me.

thanks bunches,
kathryn

Does anyone know how the S-boxes in DES were chosen? I can't seem to find
any information beyond, "They were chosen to introduce non-linearity into
the enciphering algorithm." Has anyone tried making up their own S-boxes
and what were the results? Also, is there any truth to the rumor that the
S-boxes were chosen to provide a 'trap door'? Lastly, can someone kindly
point me to where I can find the test cases to validate a DES implementation?
Many thanks in advance.

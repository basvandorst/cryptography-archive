mech@eff.org (Stanton McCandlish):
}This reminds me strongly of another recent proposal to have PGP use the
}headers, rather than the body of messages, for PG information in
}Internet/Usenet messages.

Yeah, I suggested that a year ago when I first tried out PGP
and PEM.  You want to sign not only the body but also a subset
of the headers, in particular Date and Message-Id.  People
raised the objection that this would be vulnerable to transport
damage, but clearsig messages are already almost as vulnerable.
The only kind of damage that clearsig protects against but
headersig would be vulnerable to is adding/removing blank lines
at the end, and less commonly at the header/body interface.
Well, there's a solution for that: the decryption script
tries a few combinations of adding/removing blank lines.

I'm in the middle of learning Perl, maybe I'll give this a try.

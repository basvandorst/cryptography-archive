I am ccurrently trying out the bebeta version on Penkknife.

The ciphertext shows acceptably high relative entropy and looks very
hard to break. A surface analysis leads me to believe that it would
require a "national-security-level-resources" attack to break the
Penknife cipher in a finite time with a ciphertext only attack.


I do not know whether a choosen plaintext attack would be much simpler.

My primary interest in Penknife is evaluating its ease of integration
into PC-bbased E-mail systems to provide user-controlled end-to-end
privacy for messages requiring a very high level of confidentiality.
So far it is loooking quite good for that purpose.

I will post more comments here after I have worked with Penknife more.

These are not exactly electronic checks, but there is a service called
CheckFree which allows users to enter electronic checks.  These
"electronic checks" are downloaded via modem to the CheckFree service
automatically.  The CheckFree service then mails real checks to the
bill holders, and bills the client the check amounts plus a handling
fee.

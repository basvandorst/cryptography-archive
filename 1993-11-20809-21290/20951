No, it is not fair because you already have a working idea of what the
algorithm is. He published an algorithm that is similar to the one used to
encrypt the two files he provided. In the real world of cryptanalysis, you
are not given the algorithm.

This seems to me to be an excellent opportunity to show that there is no
security through obscurity. :-).

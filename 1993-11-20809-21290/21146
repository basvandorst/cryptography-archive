My understanding was that the original poster was looking for a book to help
him out on the mathmatical side of cryptology....So it's kinda important
that the math part of the book be exceptionally good.

As for myself, I don't want a hand-wave and then jump into the different
cryptographic methods.  I earnestly want to overcome my mathmatical
deficencies and really "get it."  I gleaned only a thumbnail sketch of *why*
NP-complete problems are really hard to solve; I still don't understand why
they aren't vulnerable to...uh...some form of attack.  [massive parallelism
or some nifty factoring algorithm I don't know about]

It could be that I'm just not bright enough to get it.  However my ego won't
let me believe that, so I'll continue to hammer on finding people who *do*
get it, and have them explain it to me.  I just have to find the right
questions....

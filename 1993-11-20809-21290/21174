This is no more than using modular exponentiation in CFB mode to
generate a stream cipher, and as such is prior art.  I'm not surprised
that a patent has been awarded, as it seems that these days one can
get a patent for anything, no matter how obvious.  How this would
stand up if challenged is another matter.

The DES S-boses were chosen so that the resultant cipher would be highly
resistant to differential cryptanalysis.  It has been shown that these S-boxes
are about as secure as possible; chosing random S-boxes will almost always
result in a less secure algorithm.  NSA did not put a trap door in DES; they
made it stronger than they had do.  As for DES test data, I believe the NIST
documentation has some.

I am hoping someone out there can help me.  The library here has almost
no information about cryptology.  I am looking for ftp sites with
information in these areas: public key cryptograhy (particularly but not
exclusively RSA), the NSA, export restrictions on  crytography
(papers,editorials,anything), secret key cryptography (particularly but
not exclusively DES), and anything about clipper.  (If nothing else I
could really use a copy of the original RSA article.)  All help would be
greatly appreciated, thanks in advance.

Dave

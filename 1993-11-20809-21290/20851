Hi,

I have had a look through the FAQ but there is no obvious (to me that is) reference to an FTP'able source / executable for the IDEA cipher. Any pointers
would be appreciated. I only want to be able to run a few test
encryptions/decryptions through it to compare the resultant ciphertext with my
own algorithm implemented in hardware. (In case you were wondering this is
for academic reasons, no financial gain ... pity... :-)

Thanks,

Richard.

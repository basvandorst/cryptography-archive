Right after Ken Sheriff and Curt Welch (two of the
authors of the Cryptologia paper) posted articles here
on sci.crypt, explaining how/why the 6-digit code
was broken, David Sternlight posted a follow up.
D.S. said that, although 6 digit codes were a good
start, what the world really wants is the full 8-digit
algorithm, so he (David Sternlight) was going to
decipher the 8-digit codes himself.  Thus far he
has not revealed his results, if any.  All of these
messages appeared in January, 1993.

As to the reason for code numbers being 6 digits long,
one article from sci.crypt contained this passage:

 >     48 different start times (every hour and halfhour)
 >     10 different show lengths (30,60,90,120,150,180,210,240,270,300 min)
 >     64 different channels  {this is 2^6}
 >     32 days per month  {this is 2^5}

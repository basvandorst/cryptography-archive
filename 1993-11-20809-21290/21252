	Agreed. To get strong user authentication, you need to:

Combine something the user HAS with something the user KNOWS
------------------------------------------------------------

	That way, if the doo-dad is lost, risk is minimized (and
the user can't claim that they dropped their card and someone
else made the withdrawal). If the user gives away their "secret"
be it a PIN or password or whatever, then they haven't been
compromised unless they give up their card as well.

	The newer versions of the SecurID card have a PIN stripe,
which permutes the changing number (presumably with another encryption)
that can be mirrored at the server.

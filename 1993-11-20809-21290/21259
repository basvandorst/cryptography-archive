Rather than 1000 dimensions, you could be at best dealing with 2^56
dimensions regardless how long the message vector were.  Since as you
realize 2^56 < 2^1000, is could very well be that multiple applications
of DES will select a different 2^56 size part of the 2^1000(or whatever) space.

And DES was recently proven not to be a group, so this is apparently true.

But you are definitely right in the case of using a Vernam ("one time pad")
cipher where the key length = message length. Clearly the cipher space is
always 2^message bits meaning that there must be a single cipher composition for
any number of applications of the Vernam cipher. And it is the nice uniform
distribution in the powerset of the message space that give a OTP
perfect secrecy, that is, unlike DES no knowledge (except for message size!)
is leaked given an arbitrary ciphertext.

	Yeah.  There aren't any operational details.  Peter Wright's
_Spycatcher_ was a much better source of information.  (RAFTER & VENONA!)
As far as I can tell, the only "revelations" are the interception of
information from the Mediterranean US 6th Fleet, the universal use of
one-time pads (which he calls miniaturized ciphers, a reference to the
actual pads' diminutive size), and the stuff about U2 (the spyplane,
of course).
	I found the information about the Chinese Secret Service
a bit interesting.  There was a recent book about them but I forget
the title and the author.  Would anyone know it offhand?

	David Kahn's _Codebreakers_ is still tops.

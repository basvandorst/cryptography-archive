I'd like to get a copy of the FIPS pubs covering DES and SHS (actually I'm
mainly interested in SHS, but I thought if I get that I may as well go for the
DES ones as well), since the only SHS docs I've got are in electronic form and
therefore don't have the stamp of officialdom which a FIPS pub carries.
 
Does anyone know if there's any way of ordering these via email, or failing
that, phone (anything but snail mail)?  What's the charge involved?  Will they
take plastic?  Are they the sort of thing which your average books-by-email
place would carry, or is only the US govt allowed to distribute them?
 
Peter.

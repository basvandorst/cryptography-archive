Could someone explain just what test a 'cryptographically strong' random
number generator (e.g. Blum-Blum-Shub) passes, that an LCG fails?  To be
sure, in principle the LCG is not random, but then neither is any
algorithm for generating random numbers; and LCG passes every test I've
ever heard about.

That's not really true in this case.  Hybrid systems gain strength
from the fact that the DES key is randomly generated for every
message, and thus is never used more than once.  

Hybrid systems are _better_ in some ways than pure public-key
systems, which are vulnerable to a number of well-known protocol
failures if not used with great care.

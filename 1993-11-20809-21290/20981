Not being a cryptology expert, I thought I'd post the following to this
newsgroup.  Can someone give me a brief explanation of the relative merits of
DES-based (private key, 56 bit) encryption .vs. public key (using 512-1024 bit
keys)?  I'm more interested in how much more secure one is than the other (from
a cryptographic/mathematical perspective), rather than the administrative
or operational aspects of each.  Thanks in advance.

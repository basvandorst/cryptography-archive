Try calculating it another way.  The write-off period for computer h/w is
typically 3 years.  If your cracker runs continuously for those three years
then messages cost around $133 each to crack...

In a small country which doesn't do much DES cracking the machine would be
underutilized and messages more expensive.  A big country which sees a lot of
traffic might need several machines and costs would approach $133/message.

Some messages will undoubtedly be so important that the machine could be
justified just for them - any other traffic cracked using spare capacity
being an added bonus...

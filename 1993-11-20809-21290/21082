Mirrorshades & Prosody Release Cancelled
 
The scheduled release of Technosys' text composition program Mirrorshades
and text revision/encryption program Prosody has been cancelled because of
pressure from a governmental group claiming to be the National Security
Administration (NSA) wishing to prevent the release of Prosody as an
encryption program.
 
The "NSA" has expressed concern over the encryption method used by
Prosody. They feel that it may be using an encryption technology similar
enough to another method of natural language encryption that Prosody might
be able to be used to break that coding method. Therefore, they would like
Technosys to hand over all existing copies of the software, technical &
development notes, and software related to Prosody (i.e. Mirrorshades) for
their research.
 
Since the next step, if Technosys were to refuse, would be the seizure of all
of the above materials by search warrant and criminal charges, Technosys has
chosen to consent to their request and will cancel the release of these
programs.
 
However, THE MAN can't seize what's in our brain cells...
 
(Technosys is looking for good information law representation.
 Anyone interested?)

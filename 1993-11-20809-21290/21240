This is only true for irreversible operations.  Certainly today's computers
are full of such operations, but cryptographic operations, in particular,
are often reversible.  Thus any algorithm such as DES, where you run the
algorithm backwards to do decoding, can in theory be done with as little
energy as you please (although the less energy you use the slower it goes).
kT is NOT a limit in this case.

In practice, however, we have no idea (so far) how to build a reversible
computer with this kind of energy performance.  Even the most ideal 
computing technologies we can currently dream up have some non-ideal
dissipation (for example, superconductors have some losses when the currents
in them change, which they need to do for a computation).  Assuming we can
build a reversible computer that is within one part of 10^30 of ideal, then
this only adds another 100 bits to the search space.

So in practice you are right, but arguments from technical feasibility do not
have the the ring of certainty that the original kT argument did.  You could
also observe that the number of computers in the universe is limited to at
most the number of fundamental particles, and the fastest operation is the
time required to cross a small particle radius at the speed of light.  So
if we assume
   10^90 particles in the universe
   10^-35 seconds for light to cross an elementary particle
   10^17 sec lifetime of the universe
   ------
   10^142 possible operations total. = 473 bits

So 512 bits should surely be safe from exhaustive search.

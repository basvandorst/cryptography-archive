A while back, in Computers and Security, Volume 9 No 7 (Nov 1990) 
there was an article on block ciphers and stream ciphers. 
 
(     published by Elsevier Advanced Technology -
  Mayfield House,     |    Journal Information Center,
  256, Banbury Road,  |    655, Avenue of the Americas,
  Oxford,  OX2 7DH.   |    New York,  NY 10010.         )
 
On pages 613-619, John M Carroll (then a Professor at the 
University of Western Ontario) wrote an article called `"Do-it-
yourself" Cryptography'. 
 
The work was part supported by the Natural Science and 
Engineering Council, Canada under grant number 3172.  The block 
cipher "CRYPTO-MECCANO" was submitted  to the European RIPE/RACE 
Consortium as a candidate to replace DES.
 
In his summing up, the author suggests that the two ciphers, 
CRYPTO-MECCANO (block) and CRYPTO-LEGGO (stream), constitute a 
'kit' and in the following paragraph suggests that they do not 
come under the ITAR and COCOM regulations. 
 
Can anyone help with further information, ie:
 
1.  Where can I get a copy of the full report of the work?
 
2.  Does anyone know of any further work on the proposal, eg how 
    resistant is the block cipher to differential analysis? 
 
TIA & Best Regards,
 
Keith Lockstone.

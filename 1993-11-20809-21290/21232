Hi, Dennis.

Bet you never expected an answer from Sydney! :-)

I picked one up just the other day from somewhere. Haven't checked it
out yet, but the comments mention that the encryption is a very simple
scheme from which the key (not what the user enters) can be easily
extracted 'cos there's a whole heap of zeros near the beginning of the
file.

How can I get it to you?

Regards, FIM.

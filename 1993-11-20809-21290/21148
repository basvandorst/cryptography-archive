I had a slight problem getting mine, but a helpful staffer at the bookstore
made my November much better...

It appears that the distributor this bookstore uses was either slow in
getting the book or something like that because it was claiming that it
would not be available until December.  My bookstore contacted the
publisher directly to get me a copy.  If things are not moving at your
bookstores distributor you might try to get them to grab a copy from J.
Willey instead of waiting for the distributor...

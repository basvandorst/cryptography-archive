There are two reasons:  speed and security.  RSA is orders of magnitude slower
than IDEA (or DES, for that matter).  Also, because the encryption key is
public, an attacker can encrypt arbitrary messages at will and can attempt
to break your system that way.  There are also cryptographic reasons why it
is a bad idea to encrypt arbitrary message strings with RSA--the reasons are
too complicated to go into here, but are in my book.  In general, public key
encrpytion algorithms should not be used to message encryption.

The main pitfall is such a scheme can not be a product, widely used.

If Kibo can do it, anyone can.  Right Kibo??  (Just mention the guru
and you can usually get a followup...showing the great one is ominpresent :)

Of course, Kibo confines himself to just USENET, which is delivered
directly to his computer(s) via the net.  E-mail with paths totally confined
to the US *SHOULD* be immune to massive attack.  In this case, *they*
would need cooperation from intermediate routing nodes and comm vendors.

Some one posted a message about a study being done by the software
publishers assoication. The study was/is going to document the world 
wide usage of current crypto. IS  the study going to be available to the
public when it gets done?  

I talked with some well known experts in the field about such a study and
they said that without having access to highly classified information the
study will not be able to prove its point. What bothers me is the
closed-shop nature of the remark: only we (holders of highly classified
information) can make such determinations because we know and you don't. 

But the study should be interesting from the commercial point of view.

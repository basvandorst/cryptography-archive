Summary: i got em
Keywords: compuserve crypt problem

I run a public access internet system, and purchase a lot of modems.  I
just got 5 with 'Compuserve Free Membership' brochures, and they are very
suspicous --

  Temporary User ID Number is always	177000,625
  Temporary Password is always		EXPLORE/WORLD

Unfortunately, the agreement number and serial number seem to vary.  I
believe the 'agreement number' is a random number and 'serial' is just a
checksum.  My 5 are:

  (agreement)		(serial)
  ZF3471		25250523
  TS2316		25256819
  BL6942		25256834
  TW1254		25256843
  WF9724		25256929

There seems to be some correlation between the decial value of the letters
in the agreement number i.e.

 W (#23) + F (#6) = 29 (last # in serial)
 T (#20) + W (#23)= 43 ...
 B (#2) + L (#12) = 14 (almost last # in series)...

Can anyone provide more information?  Email me if possible and I will
summarize.

(Incidentally, I have nothing against compuserve at all.  Fine system.  I
really admire the way they rake in the $$.  $16/hr.  Wow.)

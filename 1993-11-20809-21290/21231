   For a history paper I'm writing I would very much like to correspond
   with members of the study group assembled at the end of World War II
   by William F. Friedman to work on the Voynich Manuscript (a.k.a. Roger
   Bacon Cipher Manuscript), about the activities of that group.  (This
   is the group mentioned on page 870 of Kahn's *The Codebreakers* and
   on page 168 of Clark's *The Man Who Broke PURPLE*.)

   I realize that the intersection of sci.crypt readers with the 1940's
   Voynich study group is probably empty.  But possibly someone who reads
   this is related to, or is acquainted with, an old study group member.
   If so, I would be grateful if you would pass my message on to him or
   to her.

I know this is not news to you, Jim, but if anyone else is thinking
"Gee, I can't help him, but I'd like to know more about this Voynich
Manuscript." here's a pointer to some info:

There is, or was recently, a Voynich study group which has a mailing
list and archives maintained by Jim Gillogly at Rand. A quick
excursion by anonymous ftp to rand.org:pub/voynich and maybe pub/jim
will get you a fair deal of data. This is a very serious effort, so
don't jump in just to kibitz ...

Since you're mentioned in the Welcome message for the list, I suppose
you've already tested (for n >= 1 someone on the voynich list (knows
someone who)^n knows someone on the Friedman group)?.

My impression is that there's just not enough data to crack the Voy.,
and it may stay that way unless related mss. are discovered. It is a
phenomenally tantalizing problem, so good luck! to anyone still
working on it.

Compression is a good idea for computer OPTs just because it decreases the
amount of data transmitted and therefore means less pseudo-random numbers
need to be generated, but it adds nothing to the security of the cipher.
The perfect security of a OTP is that any combination of characters,
significant to the actual content of the message or not (and overwhelmingly
on the _not_ side), is equally likely.  You are just as likely to have
parts of your message "show through" before compresion as you are likely to
have them "show through" after compression.

Just grab one letter at a time (using multiply if it occurrs multiply)
and playing with them. That is the same letters are used in both
cross and table - each letter being used no more, and no less, than it
occurrs in the other.

It's possibly only a noddy puzzle - I submitted here *just in case*
some bright spark spotted something else - if they did it could
possibly be of historical significance. However, apparently, many
have tried and see nothing else in it.

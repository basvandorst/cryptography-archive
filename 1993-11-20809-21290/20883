     You are probably thinking of the paper by Brian Wichmann and
David Hill in Byte (March 1987 pp. 127-128).

     It is somewhat better than the "minimal standard" 32-bit LCG of
Park and Miller (Comm. ACM V31, No. 10, October 1988), but not quite
as good as the 32-bit generator recommended by L'Ecuyer (Comm. ACM V31
No. 6 June 1988). I personally prefer the Wichmann-Hill generator to
the L'Ecuyer 16-bit generator, even though it is slower, but the
tradeoffs between the two are probably not of interest to this group.
Besides does anyone really care about algorithms for 16-bit machines
any more?

     There are also several families of RNG's that are, for
cryptographic and statistical purposes much less predictable than any
of these, and I am working on making them practical for simulation use.

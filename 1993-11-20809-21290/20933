In an earlier message in this newsgroup I promised to report what RSADSI/PKP
said about the idea of buying Viacrypt PGP (DOS version) and then using the
unlicensed Mac version of PGP (if one had a Mac  but not a DOS machine).

The answer, in brief, is no. Quoting from the response:

"Our position is simple: Products are licensed, or they're not. (It is
the right of the patent holder to grant licenses or not grant them.
Having paid a royalty for one product does not legitimize a
non-licensed product, however similar.) 

"The non-Viacrypt pgp software is NOT licensed, and therefore, in our
view, clearly infringes.  There are several other legal issues
regarding the Viacrypt situation, but I'm not at liberty to discuss
those.

"We have no current plans to offer patent licenses to infringing
products that exist unlicensed.  A license is required to make, use,
or sell any patented device. We insist on licensing those who wish to
do any of the above."

No flames, please--I'm only the messenger here.

Let's not start another argument about the above. It's their position, o.k.,
and one may agree or disagree with it, but that won't alter that it's their
position in the matter.

This message is intended to be informational, and not to start yet another
round of argumentation about this. It is about their position on the matter,
not "the truth."

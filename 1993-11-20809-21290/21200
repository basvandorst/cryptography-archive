I think you have a few things mixed up here. Just to clarify
things a little:

PES:  The output transformation and the input transformation
      of each round is the group cipher (.) (.) [+] [+].
      The involutary block permutation is (3 4 1 2) and occurs
      _after_ each round.

IDEA: The output transformation and the input transformation
      of each round is the group cipher (.) [+] [+] (.).
      The involutary block permutation is (1 3 2 4) and occurs
      _between_ each round.

|> I assume [g] is one round of either PES or IPES.

No, [g] is the involution in one round, and (X) is the group
cipher. Together they constitute one round. Z_A is subkeys
Z_1, Z_2, Z_3 and Z_4, while Z_B is subkeys Z_5 and Z_6.

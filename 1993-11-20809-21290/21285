I doubt this is a puzzle in our sense.  It's appeal is its cleverness.  
Also, are you sure about Pompeii.  It was buried in 79 AD, after all, and 
not excavated until the mid 18th century.

It is an acrostic and anagram, forms very popular according to William 
Friedman in the Renaissance.  They were usually pious and very clever.  
In _The Shakespearian Ciphers Examined_, Wm Friedman and his wife 
Elizebeth cite Lucas de Vriese who produced 3100 such things, and 
reproduce a tour de force on "Ave Maria gratia plena, dominus tecum".

Every line is a perfect anagram of Ave Maria without one extra or one 
missing letter.  Every line begins with its corresponding letter of the 
Ave Maria.  And the last word of every line ends with the next letter of 
the Ave Maria.  I have to take their word for it.  To give you the flavor 
of it:
  	Amacula ter munda, ita per omnia viges.
	Viges, enormi mulcta Adami pura enata.
	Enata Malis pura vige, ac merito Munda.
		. . .

Anything to pass the time, I guess.  This is from pg 111 of the book.

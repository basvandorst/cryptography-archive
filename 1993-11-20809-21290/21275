My father-in-law claims to have come up with yet another uncrackable
code.  I am not enough of a cryptologist to prove him wrong, which
(is my natural inclination anytime anyone says they have "the ultimate")
anything.  Would someone out there of higher calliber care to take
a "crack" at this?  Here goes:  The decoded message has only the
26 letters of the alphabet and the digits [0-9].  The encoded messages
is:

kith qyp1 kj0f bfhh
wk6x ilar 7mtf ppzp
b7ub 0yhc uikh ceeo
xy2g djib k4hs 1nvt
472h ahcz 66te z3fx
tjq8 a45a avt4 v4vu
p88e v5td 2lmc l

Note that the groupings are for legibility only.

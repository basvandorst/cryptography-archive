Hi,
Does anyone know about any banks providing facilities for electronic
checks? I remember watching something on CNN which mentioned this. But I
did not get to watch the whole show.
I am trying to find out about the type of security they use and how good it is.
I would also like to know what features they have available.

Thanks in advance

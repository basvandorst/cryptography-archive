One thought struck me. The original posting states that the two files
were produced on a scheme based on the July 1993 program. Now I assume
that it is the July 1993 program that is supplied with the article.

It strikes me that the scheme used could just be the fixed version of
the code, albeit fixed badly so that it still doesn't work properly.

Finding the bugs in the code may indicate where to start looking for
changes to make.

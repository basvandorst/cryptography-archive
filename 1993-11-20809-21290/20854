Triple DES can be several things.
The practice of Maytas and Meyers of repeating
the first and last key was solely done to be 
compatible with single-key systems. (if the last
key equals the first key, they cancel.)

Three separate 56 bit keys will probably be stronger.

But there are other variations such as increasing the
block size and so forth that may increase the
security as well.

If you want to play around with a high-performance
triple-DES implementation in C courtesy of 
Richard Outerbridge, et al. fetch:

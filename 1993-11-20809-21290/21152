Followups to poster.

One purpose of this exercise is to show that it is not necessary to moderate
sci.crypt:  people will start using talk.politics.crypto once it becomes
generally available (which apparently has not happened yet), and once they
hear about it a few times.  The people who favor moderation don't seem willing
to take the heat...

I have (so far) received one e-mail comment and one posted complaint about a
recent experiment in redirecting threads.  I received 10 replies to the earlier
straw poll from people who have no access to talk.politics.crypto.  People: 
you can still put t.p.crypto on the newsgroups line even if your site doesn't 
have it.  Perhaps your newsreader doesn't permit this... at least try.

I do not object to noise in sci.crypt, I read t.p.crypto and would like to
avoid the need to read sci.crpyt as well.  The articles in question were not
posted to t.p.crypto at all.  They should have been crossposted at least.

I apologize to the readers of sci.crpyt who saw the articles twice.  In
the future I will repost only to t.p.crypto and leave sci.crypt out of it.
This would be unnecessary if people would at least include t.p.crypto on
the newsgroups line even if they believe it should also be in sci.crypt.

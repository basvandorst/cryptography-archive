Revised versions of the Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS), the
informal intervendor standards developed in 1991 by RSA Laboratories
with representatives of Apple, Digital, Lotus, Microsoft, MIT,
Northern Telecom, Novell and Sun, are now available via anonymous FTP
to rsa.com or via electronic mail to <pkcs@rsa.com>.

Major improvements include the following:

     o    PKCS #7, the cryptographic message standard, now supports
          certificate-revocation lists (CRLs), "certificates-only"
          messages, and messages encrypted with only secret-key
          algorithms

     o    PKCS #10, a new standard for certification requests, is
          added. The standard gives compact formats for requesting
          key certification services such as those offered by RSA Data
          Security and other certification authorities.

Editorial improvements include updates to the references and the
addition of a revision history. PKCS #1 now gives a comparison of the
MD2, MD4, MD5 message-digest algorithms; the overview addresses
compatibility between PKCS and new work, including NIST's proposed
Digital Signature Standard, ISO/IEC 9796, and ANSI X9.30 and .31; and
the examples reflect new naming conventions.

Suggestions for further improvements are welcome.

Since its publication in June 1991, PKCS has become a part of several
standards and products, including Internet Privacy-Enhanced Mail, the
NIST/OSI Implementors' Workshop, BLOC F3 Forms Automation, Apple's
PowerTalk, Shana Informed, and Fischer International's Workflow 2000.

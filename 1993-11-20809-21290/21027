I have been having another problem with Diskreet. I set it up with the
device driver to create an encrypted partition. It works just fine on
2 of the 3 systems that I have tried it on. On my own system at home,
however, it fails. I am using an Adaptec 1542C SCSI controller and a
Maxtor 340MB drive. If ALMOST works OK. The problem occures on files
that are longer than 8KB. The first part of each 8KB segment of the
file is OK, but starting at offset 1FF1 I get glitched characters
that don't match the origional text when I run the DOS compare command.
The glitches extend for 8 bytes, then everything is OK again for the
next 8KB segment. I wrote to Symantec about the problem, but they
said that nobody had reported any problems with it. I was wondering
if anyone out there had had a similar problem.

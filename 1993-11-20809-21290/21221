Here is a factoring idea that you might want to check out.
To factor a number N that is a product of two primes and is itself
a pseudoprime, proceed as follows:
1.Select another prime,R, and form a new product.
2.Find an integer e, subject to condition (e,phi(M))=1 and construct
a dummy RSA system, (e,M,d) where d is a multiplicative inverse of e.
3. Using the procedure proposed by John M. DeLaurentis (Cryptologia,8(3),
pp.253-259,1984) attempt to factor M using (e,M,d) as inputs.
Chances are that a factor of N will be thus revealed.
To illustrate the idea here is a low-level example:
N=31417
R=941
M=N*R=29563397
e=3181
d=17731621
Using a randomly found base, a=78150, we readily find the factors of N.
Skeptical? Try your own example using as large numbers as you can find
or can handle and, please, let us know of your results.

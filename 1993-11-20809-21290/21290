I was just thinking last night about what if you wanted to make an Enigma
equivalent in real hardware, not using a computer program.  Which might
be in other words, what if you are in the 1930s and you need to make
an Enigma but you want to use off-the-shelf parts.  There were telephone
industry rotary stepping switches and they might have had as many as
26 positions.  (In fact the Japanese "purple" crypto machine was made
with such switches.)  You could use some 26-position manual rotary
switches wired to a bank on each stepping switch to model the ring
setting.  You'd need either pushbuttons or another set of 26-position
manual switches and another contact bank to set the switches to their
initial positions.  Ordinary plugs and jacks would do for the steckerboard
and also for modeling the ability to put the rotors in different order.

If anybody has a yen to do this sort of thing you might find stepping
switches at the surplus house Herbach & Rademan in Philadelphia.

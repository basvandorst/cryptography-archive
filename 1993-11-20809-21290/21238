Of course, you can always order it directly from the publisher.

For example, the number for Canadian orders is: +1 416 675 3580. (For 
those who are interested: the Canadian price is about C$63).

The toll free number for U.S. orders is +1 800 879 4539.

Of course, I have no connection with Wiley other than as a customer.

Each time you get a value from a card, you know how the clock on the card
has drifted, so you can keep track of each card's clock's drift.  A $3
watch keeps time to better than 30 seconds/year, so one use of the card
per year entirely answers any reasonable concern about clock drifts.  You
never need to accept more than the previous, current, and next valid values.

Any card that is not used at least once year, or more probably, not been
physically verified to be in the possession of the registered user should
be turned off.

If you have to worry about replay attacks within 30 seconds, you cannot
have a human in the loop, trying to type what is seen on the card fast
enough.  Instead, you need to talk to the card itself.  One use or burst of
packets per month from the card is enough to eliminate any clock drift
problems worse than a few seconds and so replay attacts slower than a few
seconds.

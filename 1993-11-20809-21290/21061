Try Dorothy Denning's _Cryptography and Data Security_ (Addison-Wesley,
ISBN 0-201-10150-5). It assumes knowledge of algebra and standard math
notation, but no more. In her first chapter, she does a thorough but
brisk job of walking you through the numkber theory and modulo arithmetic
that's at the heart of crypto. If you have trouble staying with her
you might want to supplement it with an elementary number theory text.

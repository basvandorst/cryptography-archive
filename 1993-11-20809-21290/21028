I am confused about the exact procedure at this point....

In light of there being 2 calculations of R, when I do the first one,
R <- 3.99 + (K[n]/100), do I immediately start using that R in the
confusor formulae before I procede to calculate X?

For that matter, do I plug in the just calculated X before I calc Y?
And then the new Y before calculating R the 2nd time,
R <- 3,99 + (K'(n+3)/100)?

Other than this small procedural ambiguity, I find this encryption
technique quite interesting.

Thanks in advance.

Has ANYBODY gotten Crypt Breakers Workshop to compile cleanly and run smoothly?

Preferably on SunOS 4.1.x or Irix 4.0.y or NeXTStep 3.z ?

THANK YOU!

(As soon as I decrypt an email message that contains my anon.penet.fi password,
I can send anonymous messages again.  Needless to say, I forgot the passwords
to the email message stored in a file.)

Thank you!

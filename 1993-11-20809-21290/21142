Off-charter postings are annoying.  This one was possibly off-charter.

However, reading THREE identical copies of the possibly off-charter
posting, because some butthead net.policemen want to intimidate people
into staying strictly on charter, is VERY VERY annoying.

Stop quoting entire articles and adding nothing, or you'll REALLY get
to see what a polluted newsgroup looks like.

It may suggest more than 'an implementation improvement', but it does not
deliver.

With Zip 1.x each encrypted file had a 2 byte password validation code,
so only 1 in 65536 passwords would appear valid.  The only change in 2.x
is that the validation code is reduced to 1 byte, accepting 1 in 256
passwords.  This makes it more likely that a mistyped password will be
accepted, giving rubbish output.   For people trying to break an archive
by using a dictionary, (or a password generator), it means many fewer
passwords are rejected - and must therefore be tested by trying to decrypt
and then decompress the data.

Using cryptanalytic methods the loss of data is disappointing, but has a
smaller impact.

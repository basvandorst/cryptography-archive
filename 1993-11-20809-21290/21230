To assist with research on Anglo-Dutch relations during World War II:

1.   I am looking for personal accounts and/or citations: 
        a) in support of the theory that the Englandspiel was SOE's 
           "Grand Jeu" or Triple Cross success, and (contrary to 
           official reports) a Gestapo Double Cross failure.  
        b) regarding the Englandspiel and the Dutch underground network 
           known as WIM.

2.   Does anyone know the title of the book published some time after 
     1989 by Leo Marks, SOE's chief cipher officer during the war, 
     that relates his experience with the Englandspiel?

Please e-mail.

Thanks very much.

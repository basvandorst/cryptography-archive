Subject: HEY, here's how to get PGP!
Lines: 14


Hey cutie, did you know your system operator has a crush on you and has been
reading your e-mail?  And that Big Brother is scanning internet e-mail for
keywords?  Take your privacy into your own hands, and hop over to
alt.security.pgp or comp.dcom.modems to find out how to get and how to use
encryption for your e-mail.  Got no secrets?  Get a life!  But first get
MacPGP.  Look for "Free Mac Encryption Program PGP Available!".  Got no Mac?
 Read it anyway for pointers to other versions.

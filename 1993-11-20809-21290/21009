I've been trying to get CBW to run on my Sun 4.1.3 system with little success.
It complains that it can't find some procedures that I know are in the Curses
library.

I gave up and just included /usr/lib/libtermcap.a in the list of object files.
It compiled with only minor warnings (duplicate procedures).

I tried running it and the screen looked horrible.

Does anyone have a correctly running/compiled version?

I'd like either a makefile or instructions on making a makefile.

Thanks in advance!

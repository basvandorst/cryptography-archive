Hello, hmmm i'll have to try this, I was not aware of this, I had problems
with the shift keys on a 386 and 486 for entering the pass phrases. The bios
was an ami bios and I was wondering whether this was a bug with pgp as well,
since you had to hit the shift key a couple of times to make the capslock light
go off and if you didn't then pgp would not accept your passphrases in the
decrtyption stage.
Is this another bug with 2.3a and when is the new version coming out??

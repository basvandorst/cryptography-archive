:But the "million bucks" is not the cost of recovering a single message,

:Of course, today not everybody has access even to that, and even those who

:3.5 hours just to crack your silly messages.  But these are 1993 prices
:and technology.  Think about the hardware you could get for a million dollars
:say, 10 years, ago and then consider what equivalent processing power costs
:today.  Even considering a slower technology/price curve due to the special-
:purpose nature of a DES cracker, one would be foolish to entrust single-
:iteration DES with anything the least bit sensitive.

If there is a common header this attack might be possible:

1. Collect plenty of messages, say 2^20.
2. put the messages in a hash table
3. for each possible key:
     encrypt the common header
     do a lookup in the hash table
     if match then do further tests for that message

This attack can easily be foiled by using the correct mode and
always starting the message with some random bytes.

For single DES this attack would yield one message in on average
2^(56-20) = 2^36 steps.

No I wasn't serious; it was a joke you might have got if you'd read back
a few days of this group instead of diving straight in with your posted
algorithm.  Have a look on rsa.com of rtfm.mit.edu for the Faq for this
group; you might find some good references to chase up on algorithms
like yours.  A day in the library would be well spent.

  You may FAX the publisher and they will return a FAX with the
  information you need to order a copy.  You can request airmail
  shipping for a little extra and the book will arrive in around
  a week or 10 days.  This is what the publisher told me on the
  phone.  They are becoming used to requests for this book :-)

Kathryn,

Get a copy of the ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Regulations).
A copy can be obtained by anonymous FTP from
SAMSARA.LAW.CWRU.EDU
(The file ITAR.ASC is a pure ASCII MSDOS text file, the file ITAR.WP is
the same except that it does not have any line endings except at the
ends of paragraphs.)

But you will find that the ITAR raises many questions.
So you may have to ask the people in State who administer it
how it works.  I am told that talking to them is a "damnably unpleasant
experience".

There is current pressure on congress to change the laws since many foreign
countries allow export of crypto stuff and we are losing business.  But
whether that will happen is an open question.

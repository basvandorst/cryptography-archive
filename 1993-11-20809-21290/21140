It's set up liker a textbook because it _is_ a textbook. I agree thqat the 
discussion of complexity theory is really confusing; fortunately, it doesn't 
seem to be terribly important to anything that follows--it's enought to know 
that NP-complete problems are computationally very difficult to solve.
On the other hand, I thought the disucssion of number thery and modular
arithmetic was quite thorough if a little fast-moving. And as you say, an 
answer key to at least some of the chapter problems would be very helpful.

It's more fun to search the *content* of the articles for a list of
regexps, since nobody uses appropriate "Subject:" lines anyway.
Unfortunately, nn can't search anything but headers.  NN's search is,
however, handy for those times when you only want to search the "Subject:"
or "From:" lines; it runs in about five minutes here, while a full
search of everything is several hours.

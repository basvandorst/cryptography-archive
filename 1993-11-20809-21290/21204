I got mine about two days after Bruce posted that it had been printed.
Bruce had previously announced the ordering info and suggested people
go to their local technical bookstore and order it.

I went, instead, to my local SF, Mystery, Cookbook and Travel
book store.  I like to support them because they try hard and are
across the street from a boring ordinary chain Waldenbooks (in
Lexington MA).

They ordered it direct from Wiley and it came in very quickly.

Your mileage may vary.

For a "sneak preview" of an article that I just submitted to the IEEE
Transactions on Information Theory, call my BBS at 303-938-9654 or 
anonymous ftp to csn.org and look in the mpj directory.  The algorithm
description is open to the entire public.  The sample program and 
source code for the algorithm is available to U. S. Citizens in the
USA only -- see README.MPJ at the ftp site above or read the 
[N]ewsletter on the BBS.  Any comments on the MPJ2 Encryption
Algorithm's strengths and weaknesses would be appreciated.

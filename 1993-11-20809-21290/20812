[Note: I am not bashing RIPEM or triple DES.]

And there is always the assumption that you know what level of security
you are going to need.  Maybe the folks who are interested in reading
other people's mail are counting on people making that assumption.

While it's true that security in general is not binary, there are some
methods of encryption that are *much* more secure than others, and the
tradeoff involved in using stronger encryption is negligible on any 
"decent" machine.  This is much unlike something like system security,
where extreme measures make the users jump through hoops or cripple the
system.

If someone can decrypt it without authorization, why bother encrypting it 
at all?  For me, encryption is binary -- I either use none at all (I don't
really care who reads it), or a strong cipher.

Hmmm.  So you're telling *all* of us to "get a clue?" :-)

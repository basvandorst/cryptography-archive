I I hope no one minds if a nonproffessional posts here.  I 
think this newsgroup is fascinating.  I have alwas been
interested in cryptalogy and I fond the FAQs to be very
enlightening.  Does anyone think
there is such a thing as a code that cannot be craked?  
Has anyone invented such thing?
In read read
in the FAQ that most codes are based on algorithms.  What are
some other ways to make good codes?  
I have a friend in Cincinnatti wo used to do code work for
different corporaton,

I was somwhat dis-appointed
that therem didn't seem to be a anything in the FAQs about the
psychiology of codebreaking.  I think that woud be very important
too.  Does anyone agree with me me?
How do you get into the code business?  
Do you have to be a mathemettician?   
Can you get a degrie in it, or do they just hire math majors?  
I am thinking of be going to colledge after I get my G GED.
I'me not sue what I want to study exacly, I might go to a
@2-years school.  what do yo suggest?re there a lot of jobs in this field?    I know you are all
professionals here, but I am just starting out nd I am 
intereste  to know how you m learned how to read secret
messages.   I don't know whether I want to study
psychiology or maybe somethig else,.  like scriptology.
I find it all very interrest.ing and I hope to
further my edu education.  SO THANK YOU!!!  I will
check this newsgroup tomorrow so goodbye till then.
Please respond, because this is a real project for me!

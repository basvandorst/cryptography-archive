     Actually, the day-to-day cracks were trivial, it was every ten
days that a new break had to be generated.  (The Japanese used each
key on ten succesive days by rotating the characters.)  This is one of
the reasons why in general all Purple messages that were intercepted
were read, while the English averaged about 30% of Enigma messages
read at best.

     Codebreakers by David Kahn will serve as a reference for all
this. (This is SCI.crypt after all.)

I called my local B&N right after your article appeared in DDJ and was told 
that the computer indicated that it wouldn't be shipped until the first week 
of December. I asked to reserve a copy and was told that their system had a 
tendency to lose orders that were placed more than two weeks prior to the 
release date.  They suggested I call back after Thanksgiving.

All in all it was fairly strange because B&N has been great for special 
ordering books in the past.  BTW, their system still showed the book at $39.95.

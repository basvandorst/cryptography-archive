	I've just started reading this book by Victor Sheymov,
an ex-KGB cipher and communications expert who defected more
than ten years ago.  Has anybody else read this book, or has
this been discussed already months ago?
	I'm curious to see no discussion of this because a lot
of people commented on the movie "Sneakers," about how some of
the things they did would or would not work.  This book shows
the techniques of the real thing.
	A summary of topics in the book that may be of interest
to this group will be forthcoming, as soon as I finish reading.

	Joseph

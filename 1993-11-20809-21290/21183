It seems there was an article in Scientific American sometime in the last
10 years explaining the intriguing and unexpected discovery that information
storage and processing are _not_ limited by thermodynamic or quantum 
constraints; i.e., computing can be done with essentially no energy input!
Seems counterintuitive and I didn't understand the argument, but I'm 
pretty sure that's what it said.

It sounds like these are transposition rather than substitution
ciphers, given the English-like frequency-count data.  (And congrats
to Ed Rupp for taking the time to do this check!)

As I read it, the program which produced the cyphertext is not being
made available.  It is supposed to be (in some way) "similar" to the
cipher.c program, but not the same.

My guess would be that the program reads in a block of text, and uses
the PRNG from cipher.c to do something like:

   for (i=0; i<BLOCKSIZE; ++i) {
	j = random(BLOCKSIZE);	/* 0..BLOCKSIZE-1 */
	<swap block[i] and block[j]>;
   }

(Yes, I know this is not the right way to get a random permutation of
the block, but the author of cipher.c is probably ignorant of this.)

The BLOCKSIZE would probably either be a power of 2 or the size of the file.

I don't know how one would go about cryptanalyzing such an algorithm.
Exhaustive search looks pretty expensive, since you wouldn't know how
a block began until you had processed the whole thing.

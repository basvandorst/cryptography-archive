 Des May now be breakable with exhaustive key searches- 56 bits ain't
 much these days. Triple DES ( 112 bit key) is apparently as secure as they come.
 Public key depends on how easy it is to factor a large (512 or 1024 bit)
 number. Believed to be strong enough right now, but advances in
 factoring algorithms may make it easier. ( Note 512 bit DES- what's
 that deca DES? is probably(?) much stronger than 512 bit public key)
 Of course the huge advantage of public key is precisely the public
 key!

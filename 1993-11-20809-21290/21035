   I am hoping someone out there can help me.  The library here has almost
   no information about cryptology.  I am looking for ftp sites with
   information in these areas: public key cryptograhy (particularly but not
   exclusively RSA), the NSA, export restrictions on  crytography
   (papers,editorials,anything), secret key cryptography (particularly but
   not exclusively DES), and anything about clipper.  (If nothing else I
   could really use a copy of the original RSA article.)  All help would be
   greatly appreciated, thanks in advance.

There's a bunch of crypto documentation and utilities for anon-ftp on
black.ox.ac.uk (129.67.1.165).  Take a look in the directories
/DOCS/security and /src/security.

Happy browsing.

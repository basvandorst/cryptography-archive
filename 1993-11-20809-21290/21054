The short answer is Yes.

Again, the answer is yes. The purpose is to make the generated sequence
diverge as rapidly as possible from the K[n] sequence to avoid
disclosing information about the K[n] sequence if the K'[n] key values
are compromised by any method.

This algorithm is scaled-down and simplified for use on a calculator of
limited programmability and a very limited number of storage registers.
The full algorithm has a more complex method for key management that is
less vulnerable to computer-aided attack with current generation
computers and mathematics.

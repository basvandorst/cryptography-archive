- What sort of cost does that tend to be?  For example, how much would you
- pay for an hour on $50M worth of Cray hardware?

Just doing some quick, simple math: assume that you can run the box 24hrs/day,
and the equipment is useless after only two years yields about $57 per
hour (this is the $1e6 DES cracker, not the Cray). You'd need to add
electricity to this (I'd be surprised if that was as much as $1 per hour)
and people to run and administer the hardware (call it $30 per hour).
This yields a total cost for one decryption of about $308 per message.
Let's even assume this is a profit-making venture, and the cost to you
is $500 per hour. This isn't enough cost to stop anyone with more than
an curious interest in breaking your cypher. I'm surprised it hasn't
already been done.

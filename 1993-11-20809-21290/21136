Fairness is relative.

The program is available to only one person; the algorithm has not been
published; a mere 20K of ciphertext (in two different keys) has been
published; we don't have known plaintext; the prize is a piddling $100;
and _still_ somebody's probably going to break it before time runs out.

According to Stafford, it isn't fair if the attacker gets to see _two
files_ encrypted with the same key.

Some published cryptosystems---IDEA, say---can be used by any number of
people and will still withstand chosen-plaintext attacks on a single
fixed key by an adversary with millions of dollars to spend.

When you're using IDEA, life becomes a lot more fair.

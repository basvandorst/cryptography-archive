PGP is available in source and you can see the implementation of IDEA
there. An alternative is the PostScript description of the cipher that
can be obtained from our ftp site - it contains a sample
implementation in C, but you'll have to type it in. The full reference
is ftp.informatik.uni-hamburg.de:/pub/virus/texts/crypto/idea.zip.

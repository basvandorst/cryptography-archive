IDEA seems to be stronger than DES - it uses longer keys (long enough
to make brute force impractical) and seems to withstand differential
cryptanalysis. As far as I know, no successful attack against it is
publicly known. It is probably as strong (or slightly stronger) as
triple-DES.

For an implementation, you can look in PGP's code. It uses IDEA as
symetric cipher.

Some information about IDEA (actually, Chapter 3 of the Ph.D. of the
person who created it) can be found on our ftp site:

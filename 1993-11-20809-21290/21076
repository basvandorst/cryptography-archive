You should have insisted on a search/seizure warrant, for several
reasons:

1. You have indicated uncertainty over who exactly demanded your
   material.  While this could be a legitimate government agency, it
   could have also been good actors hired by a competitor....

2. The constitutional guarantees mean nothing if you feel compelled
   to obey a government agent's *wishes*, rather than court orders
   (or certain lawful orders of emergency personnel, in the performance
   of their duties).

3. You've established a precedence that you will hand over material
   to the "government" on request.  This makes it *much* harder for
   you to refuse the next time, or the time after, or....  It's better
   to demand a court order now (and risk going out of business) than
   to be repeatedly kept from releasing products (and going out of
   business anyway).

4. The claim of "criminal charges" seems bizarre.  Had you handled 
   the material in question over to your lawyer, nobody could accuse
   you of knowingly spreading classified material because 1) you 
   no longer possessed it and 2) you don't *know* that it's classified.
   (because the agent would have broken the law to tell you so).  If
   a court order was produced, the lawyer could still hand the material
   over.  If the court order was not produced in a timely fashion (as
   determined by the lawyer), you would get your material back.

   But now, odds are your material has been shredded, burned and
   compressed into glass blocks (unless the "agents" were working
   for one of your competitors!).

5. The claim that "this is too close to something important" violates
   the input-only rule of security.  By insisting that your product
   was similar to a secret system, these agents are providing valuable
   information about that secret system precisely because it is close
   enough to warrant seizure.

   This is bizarre -- if someone's getting too close you don't shout
   it for the world to know; instead you keep *real* quiet (and
   perhaps quietly find a cushy job for the critical people in
   another company).

6. Finally, even if the worst came to pass and your material was
   seized and all employees where thrown into jail, there would be
   a tremendous amount of press coverage asking precisely what was
   going on here!  If someone with a security clearance spills the
   beans, arrest them.  If someone discovers something *similar* to
   a classified process *on their own*, that's the march of technology
   and the classified systems should already be several years beyond
   it -- but you *don't* arrest those people.

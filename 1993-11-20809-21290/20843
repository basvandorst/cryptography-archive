I'm a little confused here.  So a 135 or 136 digit would take 100 times
as long to factor as a 129 digit number?  Eg, what (roughly) are the 
multipliers for a table like this:

digits     time multiplier
 129        1
 130
 135
 150
 200

Also, on a different but related topic, I remember a news report of several
months ago trumpeting the discovery of the new largest prime number, but
I couldn't remember the application they said it had.  This application
would seem to be one of them.  Does anyone know what that number was (how many
digits did it have?) and whether, in this application, it would be useful
in creating private keys or merely (!) testing the time it would take to factor
a number of that size.  Are there any other applications for large prime 
numbers?

Forgive any FAQs/outside-of-the-field naivete,

If the pad is chosen well [i.e. randomly], then about half of the bits would
"fall through" unencrypted; similarly about one byte in 256 would fall through.
Which means that if I send the message
  "Meet me for coffee at 4:00pm.  You know where.  Hugs & Kisses.  XXX"
it would just likely appear as
  "Let's burn something. 4:00pm.  You know where.  Uh huh, uh huh. BnB"
or
  "Five kilos crack.  Meet me at fifth and seventh street.  Bring $10K"
or
  "3hlk4h2kDFSJH@#423rsASDGF @#4 rWDJFKSJ$@34ASD  qaweRJK@ fktj243k5j2"
[or any other given random string]

The fact that some information may "leak through" would tell nothing to the
attackers since they'd have no way of telling what seemingly suspicious
stuff was real and what was just the random interaction of the pad and the
cleartext.

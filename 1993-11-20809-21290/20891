Does anyone know a FTP site with the latest version of IRIS.
 
The following is the description of version 3.5
 
 
                                       IRIS
                                       ----
 
                          A Cryptographic Security System
 
                                   Version 3.5
 
                                   March  1989
 
    IRIS   implements  commercial  cryptographic  techniques  under   the   DOS
    environment:
 
              RSA public key cryptography
 
              DES cryptography
 
              VERNAM (XOR) cryptography
 
              PLAYFAIR cryptography
 
              CRC (checksum) generation
 
              Secure file erasure
 
    IRIS  is  intended  to be used by users with a need to  store  or  exchange
    sensitive information in a secure manner.

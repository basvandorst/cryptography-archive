Hello, everybody!

A Russian paper about information security I am revieing right now,
mentions a Russian standard algorithm for data encryption. As I get
it, it is a symmetric cipher. The paper mentions is as "the well known
algorithm" and states that it is standard number GOST 28147-89. If
somebody from that part of the world is reading this, could you please
provide some more information about this algorithm? Is it DES? If not,
could you post a description (should be publicly available, if it is a
standard).

Another point of interest. The paper says that on September 21st,
1993, Central Bank has began to use digital signatures of all
documents that are transfered in electronical form. As far as I
understand, they are using ElGamal, not RSA, and it is expected to be
accepted as a state standard.

There's some other interesting stuff; in particular they are
discussing TEMPEST. In Russian this abbreviation is "PEMIN", where the
"E" is the "reversed E", not the "regular" one.

Regards,
Vesselin

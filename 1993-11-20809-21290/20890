Christoper Galvin mentioned a product named CyberDesk in the Nov. 1993
article in Compuserve Magazine titled "The Digital Deadbolt".
 
Has anyone used this product and how do you contact CyberCorp?
 
Christopher's description of CyberDesk is as follows:
 
The Cyberdesk product gives users a single Windows interface to multiple
e-mail and public information systems, and has a seamless hook to third
party encryption programs of the users choice.  Those who wish to encrypt
a message simply click on a "lock and key" icon.  This feature encourages
encryption among users who have avoided it due to having to go back and
forth between composition and communications programs and the encrypting
utility.  Nan Atwell is sited and being a contact at CyberCorp.

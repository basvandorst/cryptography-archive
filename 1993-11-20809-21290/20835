yes, not even close.  They may use the same RNG but thats about it.

It is strange that the cyphertext has a close to asc distribution while
it has a weight of 125 (secrt2) or 126(secrt1) which is very close to a pure
RNG weight of 128, but a little on the low side.  So it would seem to me
that given the asc like distribution that they are not encripting all
the plaintext, just most of it.  If you were not to encrypt about 1/10th
of the plaintext it might account for this distribution and weight.  There
could be some rule like if the random number is between 90 and 115 then
don't do the xor.  i don't know I'm just speculating.

cypher.c produces cyphertext consistantly that has a weight of 127
or 128.

weight is the total value of all the characters divided by the number of
characters.

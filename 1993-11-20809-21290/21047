Piece of cake! Get hold of back numbers of Cryptologia and you will have
plenty of references. You may also get going with an elementary number
theory, say an easy text by Or on the History of Number Theory. That will
get going with algorithms such as RSA, factoring, primality tests, etc.
Of course, there is more to it but it should whet your appetite to pursue
the matter further. I have a package of PC programs at both the double and
multiprecision level addressing most of the currently relevant analyses of
the RSA algorithm. If you are interested, drop me aline. Ted Kaliszewski.

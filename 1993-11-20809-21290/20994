I would appreciate any information on how PKZip encrypts (the -s option 
for passwording) in DOS, and how secure it is, etc.  I looked at previous 
posts and the FAQ but neither had mention of this.  If this belongs in 
another newsgroup, please direct me there.

I'd like to compress and store some personal files but would like to be 
sure there isn't an accessible way to access them without my consent.

Thank you.

Seems like there should have been a bunch of them in the surplus markets
of the world after "The Ultra Secret" was published :)  But probably in
the more obscure surplus markets of the world.

As for building replicas, that's something that just can't be done

manual typewriters and Teletypes just aren't made anymore; the industrial
capacity no longer exists.  Anybody wanting Enigma functionality today would
use a PC.

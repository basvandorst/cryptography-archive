Try advertising in _The Cryptogram_.  Write to the Editor, The 
Cryptogram, 1 Pidgeon Drive, Wilbraham MA, 01095-2603.  I think the rates 
are real cheap.

There are several ACA members who collect crypto machines.  If anyone has 
an Enigma they might not part with it for any consideration.  But who 
knows.  Be prepared to pay a bundle.  It would be a prize collectors item.

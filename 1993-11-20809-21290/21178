To actually answer you: your system is one of a class of cyphers known
as polyaphabetic substitutions. These encode a string of characters using
a rule of the form:

    C[i] = f (K[i], P[i])

where C is the output cyphertext, P is the input plaintext, and K is the
message key; in each case, [i] means the ith character. In your case, 
f (a, b) means take element b of table a. You generate 4096 tables from the
master key, and then use it to seed a random number generator, which
then in turn generates the values of K.

It turns out that, with such a system, security lies entirely in the
ability to predict K[i+1] from K[i]. In other words, the exact form of
the random number generator is important. In the case of your RNG, given
any one value, all future and past values are known.

Now, to break the system, I need a piece of cyphertext and the
corresponding plaintext (either by guesswork ("it's 'Dear Clive'") or by
raiding your office). Suppose that the first letter of plaintext is D
and the first of cyphertext is X. Then entry 68 (ascii code for D) of
one of the 4096 tables must be 88 (X). This puts restrictions on the
seed to the RNG, because it must have generated appropriate values at
two places (building the tables, and encoding the D). Repeat this for
all the guessed characters, and you severely limit the seed value
(hopefully to one case, but if not, you now just try all the values
you've got and see which one generates sensible text).

Perhaps a sci.crypt expert can explain this better.

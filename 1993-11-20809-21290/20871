Summary: Request for comparative performance figures


I hope no one will argue with me regarding the NSA, triple-DES, etc.
as a result of this post.  I'm trying to get some information, not
voice an opinion.

Does anyone have figures on encryptions/second in software for some
of the big parallel-VLSI servers comercially available?  Figures for
CBC mode with multiple messages and multiple keys handled simultaneously
would be ideal, but even ECB figures would be useful for comparison.
Does anyone sell a box specifically for this, perhaps feeding multiple
dedicated chipsets?  What are the hottest DES chips out there and what
kind of performance do they have to offer?  BTW I have read Michael
Wiener's Crypto '93 paper, but I don't think building my own machine
is the way to go.  A really useful set of comparisons would include
(1) a $25 million massively parallel, pipeline superbox, (2) a more
realistically affordable/installable server with tight parallelism
(Would one of the new parallel servers for running relational
databases be a reasonable solution?), (3) a commercially available
DES or DES/SNA server, (4) whatever IBM is selling, and (5) doing it
in software on an HP Apollo.  If people send me some benchmarks on
individual machines via mail, I'll compile a table and post it.  Hope
this is of general interest.  Thanks in advance.

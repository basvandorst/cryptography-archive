The current _Business Week_ has an article, "Duking It Out for the 
Decoder Ring," that states "... US companies risk losing $6 billion 
or more a year in sales if customers switch to foreign sources of 
[encryption technology] software." This is according to the the Business 
Software Alliance. (Who they?)

The issue is Nov 22, 1993, page 2^7.

Also mentioned is the prediction that the Clipper chip will be used by 
the US government and companies doing business with it, "beyond that, 
limited use." And "export controls will be relaxed early next year but 
not nearly as much as industry wants."

Cheers,

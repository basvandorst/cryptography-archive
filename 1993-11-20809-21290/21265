avi rubin has written a tech report on his recent research into
analyzing cryptographic protocols that can forget things during
a run of the protocol.

the report is available by anonymous ftp from citi.umich.edu in

sorry about the long path name.

                                ABSTRACT

This paper presents a new method for specifying and analyzing cryptographic
protocols.  Our method offers several advantages over previous approaches.

Our technique is the first to allow reasoning about nonmonotonic protocols.
These protocols are needed for systems that rely on the deletion of
information.  There is no idealization step in specifying protocols; we specify
at a level that is close to the actual implementation.  This avoids errors that
might otherwise render a specification that passes the analysis, useless in
practice.

In our method, knowledge and belief sets for each principal are modified via
actions and inference rules.  Every message is considered to be broadcast, and
we introduce the update function to maintain global knowledge.  We show how our
method uncovers the known flaw in the Needham and Schroeder protocol, and that
the revision by the same authors does not contain this flaw.  We also show that
our method correctly handles protocols that are trivially insecure, such as
Nessett's noted example.

We then apply our method to our khat protocol.  The analysis reveals a serious,
previously undiscovered flaw in our nonmonotonic protocol for long-running
jobs; one that seems obvious in hindsight, but escaped the attention of the
authors and over 300 USENIX conference attendees.  In addition, our analysis
reveals a previously unknown vulnerability in phase II of khat. These are
stunning confirmations of the importance of tools for analyzing cryptographic
protocols.

    I think you are missing the special case nature of the BBS
approach.  Your statement is correct (AFAIK also) in the general case,
but remember that BBS select "special" primes which allows them to
make some additional assumptions such as those involving the Jacobi
symbol with respect to N.

     Having said that, the paper has a "note added in proof"
pointing to a paper by W. Alexi, B. Chor, O. Goldreich and C. P.
Schnorr in the IEEE 25th Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science.
The note says that paper allows replacing "modulo the QRA" with
"modulo the assumption that factoring is hard," but I haven't looked
at that paper. (The Blum, Blum, and Shub paper has enough open
questions for me.)

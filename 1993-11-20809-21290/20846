For a 4-fold increase in factoring time, you can increase the number of digits
by about 12, not 6. Increasing by 6 roughly doubles the compute time.

:I'm a little confused here.  So a 135 or 136 digit would take 100 times

No. Let me try to shed light on this, because the prior posts have not
been worded very well.

For composite numbers near 130 digits, adding 6 digits to the size of the
number to be factored approximately doubles the time to factor it. So, 135
digit numbers will take about twice as long to factor as RSA-129.

This factor of 2 drops (very) slowly to 1 as the size of the number goes
to infinity. Thus, near 200 digits, adding 6 digits to the size of the number
will only increase the factoring time by a factor *less* than 2. (say about 1.5)
Noone knows the exact value for numbers above about 150 digits. Up to 150
digits (or so) the value can be extrapolated from factoring efforts on
(many) smaller numbers. Near 150 digits, I expect run time to double when
about 7.5 digits are added (+/- .5 or so).


:Also, on a different but related topic, I remember a news report of several
:months ago trumpeting the discovery of the new largest prime number, but

M756839 = 2^756839 - 1.

:I couldn't remember the application they said it had.  This application
 
None, so far as I know.

:would seem to be one of them.  Does anyone know what that number was (how many
 
Nope. It is much to big to be useful for RSA.

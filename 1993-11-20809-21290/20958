                      Announcing: Cyberdesk
 
Now users can connect to and manage their electronic mail and public
information systems with just one package: Cyberdesk from CyberCorp,
Inc.  Cyberdesk's graphic interface gives users seamless and automatic
access to the information critical to them.  Cyberdesk helps them
manage CompuServe, MCI Mail, The Well, and cc:Mail.  At the end of 2nd
Quarter 1993, Cyberdesk starts shipping to Windows 3.1 users.  It has a
suggested retail price of $395.  CyberCorp is offering a 60 day
introductory price of only $179.
 
Cyberdesk opens up cyberspace.   In the past there were two ways for
people to reach cyberspace: 1) Buy a separate program for every
information system they use. 2) Or, buy a general communications program
that connects to a variety of places, but doesn't manage their data.
With Cyberdesk, users get the best of both options.  Users can connect
to multiple systems and manage the data available on those systems.
Cyberdesk lets users manage messages to and from MCI Mail, CompuServe
(both private e-mail and public forums), The WELL (both private e-mail
and public conferences), and cc:Mail (both on a local LAN or through a
remote access program).
 
Cyberdesk includes special agents that logon to each system and retrieve
public and private messages, and online files.  The built-in offline
reader and writer let users quickly read, reply, file, and delete
messages.  With Cyberdesk there are no scripts to write, and no special
programs or complex commands to learn.  Plus, users don't need to waste
money on expensive gateways because Cyberdesk transfers messages using
standard modems and phone lines.
 
Users can stop worrying about typos and misspelled words in their
e-mail, too.  Cyberdesk checks messages for spelling errors before the
world sees them.  And, their e-mail stays private.  Cyberdesk works
with third party encryption programs transparently.
 
Cyberdesk gives users a single address book for all the e-mail systems
they use.  Just ask an associate for their mailbox and e-mail system
name.  Then add their address, in its native format, to the address
book or enter it on the fly while writing a message.  Cyberdesk
translates the address to a format your e-mail system can understand.
 
Cyberspace is so vast that it's been difficult in the past to
comprehend how each system fit together. Cyberdesk helps users see
cyberspace.  A graphic image represents each system in cyberspace.
These images appear in a 3 dimensional hierarchy, similar to ordinary
file directories.  These images create the user's personal map of
cyberspace.   Users can build their map in minutes with Cyberdesk's
setup program.
 
Cyberdesk combines the advantages of e-mail, off-line readers and
writers for multiple systems, terminal emulation and file transfer
into one natural environment.  Cyberdesk's unique visual image of
cyberspace helps even the novice user navigate cyberspace with
confidence.  Call CyberCorp at 404-424-6240 or send e-mail to
CompuServe 76247,3722 for more information.

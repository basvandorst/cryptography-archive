My publisher has agreed to put the index to APPLIED CRYPTOGRAPHY on-line.
I will post it to this newsgroup, and will make it available to anyone who
wishes to put it on an ftp site.  I hope this to be a dynamic index. I
am going to add a number of entries; if anyone else wants to add entries,
please send them to me.

Additionally, I apologies for the large number of typos in the book.  I was
unaware of the magnitude of problems introduced by the copyeditor until I
tried to backfill her changes into my on-line copy of the manuscript.  I am
sickened by many of the minor problems.

There are some factual errors that I have found, and I am preparing an errata
file.  I will post this to sci.crypt at regular intervals, and also make it
available on ftp sites.  If anyone finds errors, please send me a note.

Otherwise, the book is recieving an excellent reception.  If we sell out, I
get to do a second edition.

Bruce

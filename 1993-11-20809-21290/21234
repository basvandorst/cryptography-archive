Could be - but a bit "cryptic" to mark a dead person - it's likely to
provoke questions, by its very nature, and thus draw attention to those
who may need to remain in secret. The fish was better - a wee bit
of graffiti to the uninitiated - "so Freddie liked fish so we thought we'd
put on on his grave". I would think something simple would have
been better.

Well - I'm sure someone will have fun with it anyway.

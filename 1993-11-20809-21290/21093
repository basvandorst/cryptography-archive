Did you really have to quote my whole article, just to add this 1 1/2
lines comment?

Well, I -am- sure about it. I have here a program that calls itself
PKCrack - and it is in C source. It performs dictionary attack. It can
be modified pretty easily to do brute-force instead. However, my main
point remains - all known ZIP ckarckers rely on weak passwords being
used to encrypt the archive. None of them actually breaks
(cryptanalyses) the encryption. They are all useless if a strong and
long password is used. Which does not mean, of course, that the
encryption algorithm is strong - it isn't; just nobody has
cryptanalysed it seriously yet.

Regards,
Vesselin

I attemped to go through Denning's book on my own, and got bogged down in
the first chapter.  I'd had math up through Calculus in high school, but
found Denning's work really requires a teacher who really groks the material
to flesh it out.  _Cryptography and Data Security_ is set up like a text
book, complete with chapter problems.  One problem I had was that I didn't
have the answer key to the end-of-chapter questions, so I couldn't verify
that I really did have the concept down.  Another was getting
bogged down in the notational mechanisms used for information theory and
NP-completeness. (I got stumped on NP-complete.  I still don't get it.)

Once you get past chapter 1, the book improves dramaticly.  I was able to
get a fairly good overview of some of the trade offs of different systems
and gain a new appreciation for the problems that cryptographers and
cryptanalysts face.  But I still feel like an outsider as far as the
mathmatical side of cryptology is concerned.

Unfortunately I can't suggest a better book for covering the math.  A number
of people have suggested pretty good number theory texts, but I didn't write
them down when they told me....(*sigh*).

The standard way that one time pads are presented is to exclusive-or the message
with a string of random bits.  While this is good in the limiting case, a little
arithmetic shows that a run of a significant number of zero bits is likely for a
long message.  The result is that some of the message is revealed.  How would this
be handled in practice?

Thanks, DL

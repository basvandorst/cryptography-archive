Sounds like politicans after losing an election.  "The voters didn't
understand the issues!"  Some of us know very well what debit cards
are and want nothing to do with them.  But when we close a long-term
account because they foisted a debit card on everyone, without asking
and simultaneously closing the standard ATM card, they record it as 
"lost business due to change of ownership" or some such nonsense instead
of "lost business due to incompetence of management."

(What can I say?  I'm still pissed that the bank sent me a debit
card, without prior notice, which if stolen would have had access to
my entire cash reserves.  Sure I would have gotten the money back,
*eventually*, but it would have been a financial train wreck.  Then
they had the gall to tell me that I was welcome to *apply* for a
replacement ATM card, but "so sorry, we already closed your ATM
account!").

While I'm sure they can print "real" (i.e, paper) checks on demand,
they probably have arrangements similar to direct deposit with the
more common companies.  For instance, utility companies, local banks
offering credit cards and local stores.

After all, would you rather get a large package with lots of separate
checks, different account numbers, etc., or an electronic transfer
(or at worst case, a single large check) with a computer-readable
list of accounts and payment amounts?  Naturally, many companies
will generously offer a discount to the check service due to their
reduced overhead costs....

There is generally no sure-fire, mechanical process by which a
cryptosystem can be proven to be "more secure" than another (though
certainly a system can be shown to be weak, e.g., by breaking it).
This is closely related to the issue of showing how "random" (or
pseudorandom) a sequence is, a la Kolmogorov and Chaitin's ideas.

Still, the many good crypto textbooks provided all sorts of guidelines
about what makes a good cryptosystem. Stuff about unicity distance,
diffusion and confusion, key space size, and so on. 

The many papers written about attempts to show weaknesses in DES are a
starting place you might want to look at. Clearly DES is "stronger" in
some sense for having withstood 15 years of attack (differential
cryptanalysis nothwithstanding).

The breaking of the special case of the knapsack system is another
case to look at.

Peter Davidson's metric is an interesting one, though. It matches our
intuitive idea that a cryptosystem that has just been proposed by J.
Random Hacker is ipso facto less secure than something that has not
fallen despite many man-years of attempts to break it.

I doubt this can be formalized, though, as there may always be a
"trick" which is suddenly discovered and which breaks the system (a
more clever compression is found, in the Kolmogorov/Chaitin sense).
And this can never be ruled out.

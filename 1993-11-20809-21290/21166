The following table has been found scratched in various geographically
distant sites such as Cirencester (England), Pompeii, and Dura-Europos
(Mesopotamia):

Latin       (English)
R O T A S  (the wheels)
O P E R A  (with care)
T E N E T  (holds)
A R E P O  (Arepo)
S A T O R  (the sower)

N.B.: This table reads the same from
several directions. When rearranged
the following cross can be drawn:

             A

             P
             A
             T
             E
             R
A  P A T E R N O S T E R  O
             O
             S
             T
             E
             R

             O

PATER NOSTER (Latin for "Our Father")
A for Greek Alpha
O for Greek Omega

Rev 1:8 "I am the Alpha and the Omega," says the Lord God,
"who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty." (NIV)

Question is this just a puzzle where the Pater Noster cross is the
solution or is there something else meant from the block of text?

It is not known whether this is a christian puzzle - but it does
seem convincing.

Have fun

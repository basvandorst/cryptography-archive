Along with FIPS PUB 46, "Data Encryption Standard," January 15, 1977,
you might also be interested in:

  FIPS PUB 81, "DES Modes of Operation", 1980 December 2.  (Available
	from National Technical Information Service, U.S. Dept. of
	Commerce, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161.  But I'm
	following up a post that said to "301-975-2816 and ask for 
	what....")

  Federal Standard 1026, "Interoperability and Security Requirements for
	Use of the Data Encryption Standard in the Physical Layer of
	Data Communications," August 3, 1983.  

  Federal Standard 1027, "General Security Requirement for Equipment
	Using the Data Encryption Standard." April 14, 1982.

  National Bureau of Standards Special Publication 500-20:  Validating
	the Correctness of Hardware Implementations of the NBS Data
	Encryption Standard," September, 1980.  (Superintendent of
	Documents SN 003-003-01861-9.)

These are all OLD citations.  NBS is now NIST.  Federal Standards were
available from GSA, Specifications and Consumer Information Distribution
Branch (WFSIS), Room 6039, 7th and D Streets S.W., Washington, DC 20407.

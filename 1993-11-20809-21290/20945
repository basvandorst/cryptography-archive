And as a another datapoint, an extremely reliable source
tells me that the previous strong 'NewDE' scheme used in
Mac Stuffit products prior to version 3.0 was replaced by
an XOR/RNG without any fanfare.

The reasons were the usual, according to Leonard Rosenthal
of Alladin: an export license was secured. Mr Rosenthal
decried the criticism that the new algorithm was trivially
weak with the reasoning now familiar to regular sci.crypt
readers: "Well, nobody has broken it yet!"

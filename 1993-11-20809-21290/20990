DES 56 bit key is insecure, if you are worried about anyone with $10,000,000
in 1993 compute dollars to spend...which, I guess, means governments and 
large organizations today and desktops the day after tomorrow :)

No sane person has suggested large key RSA encryptions can be broken at
anywhere near this level of effort.

One of the more cogent explainations of the differences and relative merits
is in a crypto faq available via ftp from  
rsa.com  in  /pub/faq

It is clearly the company line, but is still very informative.

BTW... beware of hybrid systems that use RSA to pass a key but then use
DES for the actual encryption ... like RIPEM :(  In encryption, you are
only as secure as your weakest link.

I found the following announcement on Compuserve and I thought some
of the users here might be interested.
 
 
 
Cyberdesk Gives You a Single Interface to E-mail and Information Systems
 
 
Now you can connect to and manage your electronic mail systems and public
information systems with just one package: Cyberdesk.
 
Cyberdesk's graphic interface gives you seamless and automatic access to
the information critical to you no matter where that information is.  You
can reach CompuServe, MCI Mail, The Well, and cc:Mail all from your Cyberdesk,
today.  There are no scripts to write; no special programs or complex
commands to learn; and no expensive gateways to maintain.
 
 
Ready To Fly You Anywhere
 
Cyberdesk opens up cyberspace to you.  Cyberspace is all the computer
networks and systems connected to them, including information systems,
BBSs, public mail systems, and other computers that contain the world's
online information.  Until now, reaching cyberspace was time consuming
and confusing.  These hassles are gone forever.  Now Cyberdesk lets you
fly through cyberspace with a click on your desktop.
 
Cyberdesk does all the hard work for you.  It automatically connects to the
different systems where you have accounts or mailboxes, navigates through the
areas of interest to you, and brings you the precise information you want.
Cyberdesk translates this raw data into a single, simple format.  Your connect
time is minimal.  Your headaches disappear.
 
 
Replace Multiple Packages with Cyberdesk
 
In the past you had two choices: 1) Buy a separate program for every
information system you use, or 2) Buy a general program that connects to a
variety of places, but requires complex scripts and then didn't manage the
data you got.
 
With Cyberdesk, you get the best of both.  You can connect to multiple
systems and manage the information available on those systems from your
Cyberdesk.
 
 
Relax While Cyberdesk Works
 
You can stop wasting time and energy figuring out the quirks of systems as
different as CompuServe's forums and local LAN-based cc:Mail.  Cyberdesk
navigates these systems for you.  After you provide Cyberdesk with the
sign-on information for your favorite places, sit back and relax.  Cyberdesk
connects to and maneuvers through each system, exchanging all your personal
mail and picking up public messages of interest.  Cyberdesk takes the mystery
out of finding and moving files in cyberspace, too.
 
 
See All the Dimensions of Cyberspace
 
Cyberdesk uses familiar concepts and extends them to help you see
cyberspace.  A graphic image represents each area and subarea in your
cyberspace.  These images appear in a 3 dimensional hierarchy, similar to
an ordinary file directory.  This is your personal map of cyberspace.
Cyberdesk even helps you build your map.
 
 
Never Miss a Message Again
 
To contact associates around the world, you usually need multiple
mailboxes on different e-mail systems.  You probably only took time to check
all your boxes on occasion.  From now on, Cyberdesk checks for you.  You get
all your mail in a timely fashion.  Messages from all the systems you use
wait for you on your desk until you're ready to read and respond to them.
 
 
Handle Dozens of Conversations with Ease
 
Cyberdesk keeps related messages together so you can easily follow any
conversation in cyberspace.  Click on the button bar to move through each
conversation.  You can see the next message or jump to the next conversation.
And, you can step back in time and see what you or someone else said just
as easily.  Then file or delete a message, or an entire conversation, with
one click.
 
 
Combine All Your Address Books Into One
 
Cyberdesk gives you a single address book for all the e-mail systems you
use.  Just ask an associate for their mailbox and e-mail system name.  Then
add their address, in its native format, to your address book or enter it on
the fly while writing a message.  Cyberdesk translates the address to a
format your e-mail system can understand.
 
 
Save Big Bucks with Offline Reader/Writer
 
Most large public systems charge for every minute, even while you plow
through messages that are of no interest to you.  Cyberdesk ends this
needless waste of money.  First, Cyberdesk goes online and gets hot topics.
Offline, you pick the ones you want, and then Cyberdesk gets the details on
those subjects at computer-to-computer speed.  You read and respond with no
dollars ticking away.
 
You can stop worrying about typos and misspelled words in your e-mail, too.
Cyberdesk checks your messages for errors before the world sees them.  And,
your e-mail stays private.  Cyberdesk works with encryption programs
transparently.
 
 
Locate Online Files without Hassles
 
Finding and retrieving the right public domain and shareware programs and
data files used to be confusing and frustrating.  Cyberdesk makes it easy.
 
Cyberdesk can pick up the descriptions of files available in your
cyberspace.  At your leisure, you can look at these summaries and choose
which files you'd like copied to your computer.   Cyberdesk downloads the
files you requested the next time it's online.  You also can copy your own
files to public areas in cyberspace through Cyberdesk.
 
 
Stay In Touch While You Stay On The Go
 
We're committed to helping you stay in touch while you stay on the go.  In
addition to free phone support, our support team uses the public networks to
give you timely responses.  So wherever you operate your Cyberdesk, you can
reach us effortlessly.
 
 
 
The Power of Many Products in One Package
 
Cyberdesk combines the advantages of e-mail, off-line readers for multiple
systems, terminal  emulation and file transfer into one intuitive environment.
You don't have to be an expert any more to gain access to the wealth of
information on public and private information systems.  So pull up a chair
to your Cyberdesk and explore cyberspace in comfort.

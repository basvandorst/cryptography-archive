Hello,

	I have a small software company and have recently discovered
that one of my competitors is taking my clients away by offering to
convert my data into their program.  What I would like to do is
encrypt my data on a record by record basis (encrypt and decrypt each
record as I read and write it).  I am looking for a routine which has
the following attributes:

	a.  executes quickly so as to not impact the speed of the system

	b.  doesn't take up a lot of RAM - I'm running on a PC

	c.  written in C

	d.  secure enough that another programmer who wants my data can't
	    get it

Any pointers on pre-written C code would sure be appreciated.  Please
respond by e-mail to blake@netcom.com      Thanks.

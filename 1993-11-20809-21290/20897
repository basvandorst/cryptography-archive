    There is a hardware RNG available which people might find useful.  Its
    features include:

	* Reasonably priced

	* Attaches directly to an RS232 (e.g., modem) port.

	* Small

	* Does not need a power supply (it is low power and uses the power
	  supplied by the RS232).

	* Noise resistant.

	* Excellent statistical properties.  Extensively tested.

	* Purely physical RNG.  Unlike many commercial units the good
          statistical properties are not due to "pseudo-random"
          manipulations applied to a statistically weak RNG stream.  You
          can use this as is, or manipulate it in software (such as DES
          encrypting its output) for added security if you wish.

	* Comes with the necessary DOS and Mac software.

    For details contact Dick Bierman <bierman@cc.ruu.nl>.  (Note, my only
    financial interest in this product is that if there are enough orders
    the price will come down even lower).

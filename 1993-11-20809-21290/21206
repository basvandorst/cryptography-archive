(Folk who do not know what the RSA129 project is, are invited to send
for further details to rsa129-info@iastate.edu -- if you have idle
cycles on a Unix box with more than 8Mb RAM, you will be especially
welcome 8-)

It is now very nearly a month since I last issued a progress report
for the RSA129 project.  On October 20, we had just passed the 1
million relations point and had been collecting about 24 thousand
relations per day.  We had 14 thousand fulls and 1679 cycles.

The latest complete statistics I have available date from 2 days ago.
Then, we had 1973206 relations, made up of 26230 fulls, 339431
partials and 1607545 double partials.  The latter two categories
yielded 6788 cycles.

As we have been averaging over 30 thousand relations per day, I can
say with confidence that we now have over 2 million relations.  We
have received more than 40k relations on several days (mostly Saturday
and Sunday) and on one exceptional day over 50 thousand.  It is very
easy to see the effect of weekends on available cpu time!

Although I have tried to extrapolate the growth in the number of
cycles as a function of the number of relations that have come in, it
is still much too early to extrapolate with any reliability how many
we will need before we have finished.  We need to extrapolate a
parabola from under 7 thousand, to about 400 thousand.  As an aside:
the quadratic growth in the number of cycles can be seen in the
figures above.  In the last month, we have doubled the number of
relations and quadrupled the number of cycles.

Consequently, the best I can say is that we are about one quarter of
the way to completion, and that a few months work remains to be done.
So far, we have accumulated something over 1000 mips years of compute
power, or around 4x10^16 machine cycles.  This comfortably exceeds
both the resources used by the present factorization record
holder at 3x10^16 cycles and the recent proof of the composite nature
of the 22nd Fermat number (2^2^22+1) which took around 10^16 cycles.

If anyone is interested in a few graphs, I have made available a
couple of PostScript files in black.ox.ac.uk:/math/rsa129 which show
the growth in the number of cycles and (fulls+cycles) as a function of
the number of relations received up to a particular day.  Each point,
by and large, corresponds to a single day's data.  It is fairly
obvious where several days' data have been accumulated into a single
point.  Credit must be given to Michael Graff for producing these
files; my part is only putting them for anon-ftp.


Many thanks to everyone taking part, and I hope that you will continue
to send in ever more relations.  As always, the more people that can
be persuaded to join us, the better!

Right again, but somehow you missed the point. As I said in my orinal posting,
you are vulnerable to replay on OTHER systems. THERE is your loss of
accountability. A user can always say "somebody must have captured my
password when I logged on to ANOTHER system, then replayed it (wherever
something bad occurred). Hence, time-dependent systems do not scale up
to Internet-size very well. You've got to be VERY careful to avoid this
vulnerability, _if_ you need user accountability.

Cheers!

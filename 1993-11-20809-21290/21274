It might be a good idea to think of a new name for this - DEA is the PC name
for DES (see, for example, ISO 8372:1987, ISO 10126:1991, and ANSI X3.92). This
could cause some confusion about what DEA 2.0 really is.

It would be easier to do this if it were made available via the internet.  Has
anyone got a copy of this they could post or put on an FTP site?

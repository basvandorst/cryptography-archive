In article <1993Nov7, sci.crypt, alt.security.ripem, alt.security.keydist>, 
mjohnson@netcom.com (Mark Johnson) 

had a problem using Maurer's "Universal Statistical Test for Random Bit 
Generators" [CRYPTO `90].

The problem was caused by an error in his implementation.

  [Maurer, CRYPTO `90, Lecture Notes in Computer Science 537, page 415]:
  "These two advantages are due to the fact that for the general class of 
  binary ergodic stationary sources with finite memory M <= L, where L is a 
  parameter of the test, the resulting test quantity is closely related to the
  per-bit entropy of the source."

For example is the size (M) of memory for the four tested random number 
generators:

  M = 31  for: x[n + 1] = (1 + (x[n] * 69069)) mod 2^32
  M = 30  for: x[n + 1] = (x[n] * 65539) mod 2^31
  M = 31  for: LFSR x^31 + x^3 + 1
  M =  3  for: LFSR x^3 + x^1 + 1

Since Mark set in his implementation L = 16, the test has been used 
correctly only for last random number generator (3 <= 16).

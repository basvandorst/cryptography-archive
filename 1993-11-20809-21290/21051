I've been reading the docs and source for SHA and MD5.  It's obvious that
these are irrevocably one-way by virtue of the amount of information they
throw away.  What's less obvious to a novice is the theory which assures us
that there is no simpler, more predictable function which could produce an
equivalent digest of a message.  Is there such a theory?  Can it be
summarized in simple terms?

A somewhat related question: is there a good book which brings together the
number theory and information theory necessary for a good mathematical
basis for cryptology?  

Thanks in advance.

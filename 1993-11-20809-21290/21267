My understanding is GOST 28147-89  is not DES.   It was formally a Type 1
algorithm and was classified.  It describes a USSR / Russian  encryption 
and data authentication algorithm.  It uses a 256 bit key with 3  key
levels:  A general key, a Secondary Key and a Data Key.

The General Key is akin to a System Key and is loaded at power-up.  The
Secondary Key is akin to a KEK.  The Data key is effectively an internal
Red Key used for the actual encipherment.  
There are both hardware and software implementations of it, although the
HW versions are not as fast as many DES silicon implementations.

Rumor has it is a "very good" algorithm.

Hope that helps.

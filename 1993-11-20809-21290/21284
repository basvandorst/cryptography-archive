For ciphers the best book easily available is Elementary Cryptanalysis by 
Gaines (see the FAQ).  But what you want is steganography.  There is some 
discussion by Kahn in The Codebreakers.  There's another by Friedman in 
Military Cryptanalytics, Part 1, Vol 1, available from Aegean Park Press 
(again, see the FAQ).  This latter is cute because the discussion itself 
is steganography and hides the signature of the author (well, at least 
one of them).

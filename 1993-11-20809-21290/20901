You're trying to say that you think the encryption function is a
group.  A group is a set with an operation such that the set is closed
under the operation, the operation is associative, there is an
identity element, and every element has an inverse.

For DES at least, this isn't true.  There are 2^64 factorial possible
bijective transformations on 64-bit block.  (This is the full
alternating group on 64 elements).  There are 2^57 possible
DES-transformations of one 64-bit block; 2^56 keys, times encryption
vs. decryption.

But there does not always exist a key Z such that the transformation
induced by some key X, composed with the transformation induced by
some other key Y, equals the transformation induced by Z.  So you do
have to brute-force-search the entire doubled keyspace to be sure of
finding the right transformation.

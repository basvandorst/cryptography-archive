Far as I know RSA only holds a patent in the US. PPL are free to use RSA
outside the US.  This has to do with the method the original inventers used
to get there invention out into the public.  They published first, received
a patent later.  USA is the only country (I assume) that allows this.

They were said to have published it first instead of trying for a patent
because the NSA might of stepped in at the patent office and force them
into giving up all rights (including publication) in the interest of
"national security".

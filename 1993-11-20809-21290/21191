Rabin's theorem showed that if you can extract square roots you can
factor.  The quadratic residuosity problem is a decision problem --
whether a number has square roots or not, not finding them.  AFAIK
they have not been shown to be equivalent, so if you have the ability
to predict quadratic residuosity, it still does not necessarily imply
that you can factor.

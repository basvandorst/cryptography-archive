Sounds like a bootstrapping problem:
how do you prove how many sales you've lost if
the State Department has bullied your publisher out
of selling them?

While I don't advocate lawless activity enough
power has been already leaked to the people through
newsgroups like sci.crypt and applications like PGP
that individuals are taking direct action to
protect their inalienable right to privacy
regardless of congressional committees, San Salvador
death squads, patent attorneys, CERT or
FIDO sysops.

The technology is simply too powerful, but nonviolent,
to remain in the hands of our government.

I am interested in this field and would like to be part of the information
exchange on this newsgroup.  However, I don't have enough background to
understand the technical discussions.  I was hoping that people could email
me their recommendations for good introductory texts so I can have enough
knowledge to understand and participate.

Please no flames....

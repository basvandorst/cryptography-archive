   No, the original Blum, Blum, Shub paper uses a proof by Goldwasser
and Micali to "amplify" any guessing strategy.  Once you can predict
anything about the next number in the sequence, say predict its parity
with a 51% chance of being correct, this can be used as a crowbar to
get a 99.99999...% reliable predictor of quadraticresiduacity.  And if
you can predict quadratic residuacity, you can use that to factor N
(Rabin 1979).  Of course if you have the factors of N, you can
deterimine whether or not a value is a quadratic residue mod N, so any
successful guessing strategy is equivalent to factoring.

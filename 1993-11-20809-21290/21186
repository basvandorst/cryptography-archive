Hi all,

I am doing my term project on authorization for distributed systems.
Can anyone kinldly let me know the ftp sites where I can get these papers.
And also I want to have a look at the proceedings of the 1st workshop of
Netwrok and Distributed Systems Security held in Feb. 1992 in San Diego.
And 1st ACM Conf. on Computer and Communications Security, because these
had papers on authorization.

Please reply to my e-mail address.

Thanks in advance,

Prasad

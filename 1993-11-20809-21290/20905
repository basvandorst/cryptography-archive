Hi there.

Does anyone know of an implementation of MD4 for the hp48 (HP's top
of the line programmable calculator)?

I find myself in a position where it'd be convenient to use my '48
as a ``smartcard'' for s/key authentication, and I'd rather not
reinvent the wheel.

If I don't get any answers, I'll cobble one together and post it,
however.

Thanks!

Followups to sci.crypt and comp.sys.hp48, please.

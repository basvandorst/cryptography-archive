But the "million bucks" is not the cost of recovering a single message,
but rather the cost of the (hypothetical) hardware that gives you DES
session keys in an average of 3.5 hours.  So the cost of a given message
is just the cost of renting a million dollars worth of hardware for 3.5
hours (plus electricity, etc).

Of course, today not everybody has access even to that, and even those who
do might not consider it worth using their million dollar machine for
3.5 hours just to crack your silly messages.  But these are 1993 prices
and technology.  Think about the hardware you could get for a million dollars
say, 10 years, ago and then consider what equivalent processing power costs
today.  Even considering a slower technology/price curve due to the special-
purpose nature of a DES cracker, one would be foolish to entrust single-
iteration DES with anything the least bit sensitive.

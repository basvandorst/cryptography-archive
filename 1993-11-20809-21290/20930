Subject: Crypto questions
Lines: 26


I'm new to this group, so please forgive me if some of these questions have
previously been covered:

1.)  What is known about the crypto method used in version 2.04 of PKZIP?  I
     understand that the method employed in the previous version has been
     compromised.  Is the nature of the new algorithm known, and is it
     considered a "strong" one?

2.)  Does anyone know about the implementation of DES in such commercial
     packages as Norton Utilities, PC Tools, etc.?  Does it use the ECB
     mode, or one of the stronger ones?  Do they use a sound algorithm for
     converting an ASCII "password" into a binary encryption key?

3.)  I understand that DES is NOT approved for use with classified infor-
     mation.  Is anything, of an UNCLASSIFIED nature, known about the
     crypto methods that are used for such purposes, such as in the
     STU III secure telecommunications unit?  Is that device publicly
     available, or is it considered classified hardware?

Thank you.

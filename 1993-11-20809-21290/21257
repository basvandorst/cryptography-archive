Hello, everybody!

Somebody who wishes to remain anonymous, sent me a list of suggestions
how to improve PKCrack and to add abilities to cryptanalyse the
encrypted archives in some cases. Unfortunately, I don't have the time
to implement all this, and am not particularly interested.

With his permission, I included those sugestions in the pkcrack.zip
archive, so anybody who feels like that can get them and implement
them. If somebody does, I will appreciate if they make the result
publicly available.

Just a reminder, the pkcrack.zip archive can be obtained from our
anonymous ftp site as

ftp.informatik.uni-hamburg.de:/pub/virus/texts/crypto/pkcrack.zip

Regards,
Vesselin

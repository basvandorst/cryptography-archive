Vernon, I think we're coming to pretty close agreement. You are right that
my main concern is the tendency to deploy time-dependent cards in networks
that are too dispersed to be controlled by a single point. And you are
correct that these problems can be compensated for by inconveniencing the
user. You are also correct that this inconvenience is not as bad as living
unprotected in today's networked world. A further point is that "having more
than one system honoring passwords from a single magic crypto card... is..
a very bad idea" is particularly true if that single magic crypto card
is time-dependent. The asynchronous challenge-response cards do not suffer
from this restriction, and thus can be deployed into larger networks. Maybe
you missed my earlier postings in this thread, where I said IMHO the
time-dependent cards are an ideal solution in small networks, while the
asynchronous cards are best in very large networks.

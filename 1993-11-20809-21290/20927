While it is true can you can make any arbitrary channel
or channels leakproof, you have to translate to clear
at some (perhaps within the CPU or at the IO bus or
at the disk controller or whatever) point.

I am lookng forward to every distinguishable entity
associated with a computer: io channels, cpu, coprocessors,
processor cache, video bus, ISDN lines, processes,
everything -- having individual public keys and using RSA
internally to decode instructions and logic.

You could have perfectly secure virtual computing behemoths
spanning continents perhaps using whatever resources it
needed and delivering results in perfect privacy.

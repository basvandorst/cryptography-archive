PCTools by Central Point has a password-based encryption feature.  If
you try to decrypt with a different password it tells you right away
(not after a decrypt/checksum exercise).  But the manual sez that CP
can't help you if you forget your password.

I think this BS. How can they know if your password is wrong but not
be able to extract the right one?

Anybody look at this?

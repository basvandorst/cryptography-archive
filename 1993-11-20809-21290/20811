Quite right.  I was just pointing out that your million bucks will
just get you a single message, rather than a useful key.  This makes
such an approach much less useful, but I suppose that if the message
were known to be really important it might still be worth doing.  The
best thing to do in this case is to use triple DES for high grade
material and conceal the encryption method used in the RSA header.

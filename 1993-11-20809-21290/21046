I have been reading and educating myself with references from this forum
and other ftp sites. It is apparent however that my remedial level of math
skills (algebra in high school, one year of calculus in college years ago)
are limiting my horizons. Any suggestions of texts that "walk" you thru
the math or teach it in an organized fashion as related to cryptology?
If not, any suggestions of math texts to start on?
thanks

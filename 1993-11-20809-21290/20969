Well, OK.  In the Riddle Game Bilbo Baggins played with Gollum, as soon as
Gollum started trying to answer Bilbo's question he in effect accepted the
challenge and acknowledged that it was fair.  What does Computer Shopper
have in its nassty little pocketses?  We don't know how close the new
algorithm is to the old one, which gave more superficially random-looking
distributions before it was fixed.

In the real world of cryptanalysis, you often <are> given the algorithm, or
one close to it.  Consider the way the Poles broke Enigma, starting with a
precursor commercial model and adding a lot of heavy math.  But after the
initial break (using a <lot> of intercepted material), the day-to-day cracks
had full knowledge of the algorithm, and the unknowns were the day's key...
After Friedman's team broke Purple, the day-to-day cracks were still not
trivial, even though they then knew the algorithm.  To be strong, a cipher
needs to resist cryptanalysis EVEN WHEN THE CIPHER ALGORITHM IS KNOWN.

To add a tiny note of cryptographic relevance, I note that in SECRT1 and
SECRT2 another beyond-three-sigma high-frequency character besides the
<space> and etaoins-type characters and the non-ascii D0 is 0A, the
newline character.

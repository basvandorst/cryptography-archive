     Try a power spectrum test.  Assign to each character its
approximate frequency in Englist text, then do a Fourier transform of
the resulting number sequence.  If the unencoded characters are
appearing in any regular pattern in the encoded messages, you should
get a corresponding spike (or more realistically bump) in the power
spectrum.

     You could also try a visual test. Take the sequence above and
display the message on screen (usually in a rectangular array) with
the intensity of each point corresponding to the character's English
frequency.  It helps to choose dimensions such that small periods show
as diagonals, like 61 across.

     Hope this helps, I decided that I don't have time to seriously
attack this one, but have fun.

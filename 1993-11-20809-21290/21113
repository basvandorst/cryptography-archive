Someone does, but they won't tell you, because the design criteria are
still classified.

Yes. Biham and Shamir (I think) have applied differential
cryptanalysis to some variants of DES with different S-boxes. In some
cases the cipher has turned out to be trivial to break - even on a PC!
The moral of the story is - if you are using DES and want it to be
secure - don't touch the S-boxes.

No, there isn't any. Just the opposite, the latest research shows that
the S-boxes seemed to be designed in such a way, as to resist
differential cryptanalysis. It seems that DES is as secure as a cipher
with a 56-bit key can ever be.

I would like also to know the answer of this question. Peter Gutmann
mentioned the NBS test data - does anybody know where to get that
from?

For an article discussing the current controversies about private use of
strong cryptography--Clipper/Skipjack, export controls, etc.--we are looking 
businesses that use cryptography to protect data and are willing to talk about
it. We understand that companies that are security-conscious enough to worry 
about strong crypto are reluctant to talk about such a sensitive subject and we
will certainly respect your security needs. However, we are attempting to give 
readers a sense of the stakes in the debate over crypto and we need real-world
examples.

If you can help, please e-mail me at wild@access.digex.com.

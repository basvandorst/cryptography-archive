The least significant byte of consecutive values taken from LCGs cycle
through all values from 0..255 in a particular order ad infinitum.
Needless to say, this is a bad thing. As for tests, there are several
described in Knuth's "Semi-numerical Algorithms" volume. I recommend
spectral analysis - the plotting of consecutive bytes as coordinate
pairs on a 256*256 grid. Non-randomness shows up as diagonal stripes and
lattice patterns. If you have a color or greyscale monitor you can plot
frequency of coordinates as different colors or shades of grey, this
makes the test much more sensitive. A good RNG should gradually fill the
grid with snow. Hope this helps,

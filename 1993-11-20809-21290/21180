I apologise for my countrymen; we're not *all* like that.  See what
happens when you let electricians and chemists near software :-(

(Is it worth the bother writing to the patent office with prior art,
prior patents, and testimonies to obviousness, or will they be thrown
out on their ears anyway?  Come to think of it, when did the UK pat off
start accepting software patents???)

(When was the last time someone posted a 'great new way' to turn a
block cypher into a stream cypher on this list?  Was it before last
august?  Anyone keep this group on archive or CD?)

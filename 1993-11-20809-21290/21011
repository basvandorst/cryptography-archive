Um, I think jebright was warning specifically against those hybrid
systems which use single-pass DES as the conventional cipher, not
against hybrid systems in general.  This is because DES's 56 bit key
space makes it vulnerable to brute force search.

I understand there is a version of RIPEM now that offers triple DES,
which is generally believed a lot stronger than single DES.

        ^^^^^^^

Sorry, Bruce, but all the stores I called are saying it lists for $39.95.
For everyone else's information, it is in paper back and noone has any
info on a hard back.  As of Monday night, most major book retailer's in
Chicago and the suburbs have it on order, but it is not in their warehouses
as of yet.  Soon.......

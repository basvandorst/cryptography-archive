Triple DES is usually implemented as an encrypt followed by a decrypt
with a second key followed by a I think a encypt again with the first
key. I may have this last stage wrong and would need to double check
to be certain. However, the net result is effectivey two 56 bit keys
and three DES transformations.

My understanding is that not everyone uses this precise sequence as
triple DES. Corrections to the above are welcome

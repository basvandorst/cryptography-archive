Does anyone know of any other hard problems, besides factoring
large primes which is suitable for encryption. It seems like
there should be many such problems. When I was in school, I
seem to remember many times that the professor would say that
it was not known if something could be done.

Would such a new problem for public key systems violate
any of the public key partner agreements?

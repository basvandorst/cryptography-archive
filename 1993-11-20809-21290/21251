I asked my publisher about this.  The book was originally priced at $39.95,
and that's how it got into some computer systems.  I know of one person that
managed to buy the book at that price; everyone else payed $44.95.  If you
feel like doing a little arguing, you may be able to get it for the cheaper
price.  But the book itself says $44.95, and sooner or later all the computer
systems will catch on.

BTW, would people out of this country E-Mail me when they get a copy of the
book from a store (or mail order through Wiley).  I want to be sure the
distribution channels are working.

Cheers,

Bruce

	Hi,

	I also have been playing with this challenge from Computer Shopper.  I'm
	a UCLA student with very little background in cryptography, but I figured
	I'd give it a shot.  My assumptions are as follows:

		1. The MULTIPLIER and INCREMENT given in the sample program is the
		multiplier and increment used to encrypt the sample files.

		2. The files were encrypted on a PC with 32bit longs and 16bit ints.

		3. The files are text files.

	It seems to me that although a long is used to seed the random number
	generation, only the lower 24 bits are significant in the encryption.  If
	one encrypts a text file with 0x11XXXXXX and with 0xF2XXXXXX, the same
	encryption will result (as well as for any other high byte prefix).  Given
	this premise, I attempted to decrypt the first 15 bytes of the text file,
	resetting the key as soon as I hit a non-printable character.  I assumed 
	that the file would be text and therefore this heuristic would:
		
			1. speed up the search.
			2. display only those lines which are possible candidates for
			my perusal.

	Well, I've gone through the 16M combinations several times now, trying
	"box" characters as well as printable characters, and found nothing...
	Does anyone have any suggestions for a curious novice?

	Thanks,
	carey

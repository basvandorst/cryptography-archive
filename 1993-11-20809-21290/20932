I just picked the book up at a local Borders bookshop... the book
looks excellent.  [I did note a very minor mistake in the computational
flow diagrams for IDEA where there are missing lines from the multiplication
mod 2^16+1 by 5 to the addition mod 2^16 box but the csource code is
correct.]

To answer your question, you can order an MS-DOS disk set from the author
from an address in the back of the book.  But some of the algorithms
are already ftp-able from the network, and source listings are in the
book for you to study.

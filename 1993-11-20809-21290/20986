It seems several people were offended by my posts of info about the
Cyberdesk Software Program.  I felt it was relevant to this group since
it supports encryption and decryption of EMAIL.  This product was
referenced in Chris Galvin's Compuserve Magazine article entitled
Digital Deadbolt which discussed encryption and decryption.
 
I send Chris Galvin Email and received further info and wanted to share
the results.  I have no connection with this company other than a user
interest in EMAIL encryption and decryption enabled products.
 
I feel there is a real need to give the average EMAIL user secure
encryption and decryption and to interface it to the popular EMAIL
systems such as Microsoft Mail and CCMAIL.  The average user is not
going to use products that require a drop to a dos command prompt
and require the use of difficult command line options.
 
Chris Galvin's article is significant because it brought encryption
and decryption information to the general public.

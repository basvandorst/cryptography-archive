Greetings,

A while ago Terry Ritter posted some announcements and a beta
offer for his secret-key cipher program for email called Penknife.
Has anyone looked at the ciphertext it produces to see how easy or
difficult it would be to break? There have been fairly comprehensive
statements on how the cipher works but no responses or discussion
that I've seen. Comments?

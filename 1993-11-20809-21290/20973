In this month's (Dec.93) issue of Dr.Dobb's Journal, there is an
article describing the IDEA encryption algorithm and why it is
much better than DES.
How secure is IDEA? What are the cryptanlysts views of this algorithm?
Is there any public domain software implementing it? Which ftp site?
Any additional information on IDEA ? Feedback from actual users is
much appreciated.

If this algorithm is old news to this group, please E-mail your
replies, and I will summarize to the net.
Thanks,..

Subject: Rice Paper?
Lines: 26


Sorry for the non-crypto question, but you folks are (as far as I know)
the most likely to know an answer to this one...

When I was in the US-Navy (as a peon-class crypto-clerk) I heard of a
form of "rice paper" used by some spies.

The concept was the same as flash-paper (quick emergency destruction!)
but instead of applying fire, you applied WATER.  Supposedly, this stuff
would then melt into an amorphous glob of rice pudding.  I'd guess that
it would come in most handy when the spy has no other recourse than to
*eat* their one-time pad or whatnot.

So what I'm looking for from you folks is this:

       Where can I *get* some of this stuff?

       ...or how would I *make* something similar to it?

(Sorry again for the anonymous business... it's the only way I can post.)

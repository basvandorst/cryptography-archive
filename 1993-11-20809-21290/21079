Well, let me answer this with a short story.  There were once three students 
sharing a flat (that's "apartment" for US people), a maths student, a physics 
student, and a chemistry student.
 
One evening the physics student came home, smelled smoke, and saw a fire in the
kitchen.  Grabbing a nearby fire extinguisher, he estimated the size of the
fire, calculated how much heat and oxygen he'd need to remove from it to put it
out, aimed the extinguisher, and put it out.
 
The next night the chemistry student came home to find a new fire.  He
calculated the exact composition of the fire, the chemical makeup of the
material in the extinguisher, and whether it could be used to neutralize the
fire.  Deciding it could, he used it to put out the fire.
 
Finally, the maths student discovered yet another fire.  He looked at it,
looked at the extinguisher, said "A solution exists", and went to bed.
 
You can regard me as the maths student :-).
 
The main problem with writing a program to automatically break Diskreet is
time.  I'd rather put effort into creating something which fixes the problems
Diskreet has than spend a lot of time further destroying it.  By the time I get
SFS (Secure FileSystem, the program I'm working on) kludged to work with 1001
strange pieces of hardware, then do a more user-friendly version, then make it
run under, say, HPFS, Linux, maybe NTFS, and so on and so forth, I won't really
have much time to mess around with Diskreet.  If there really is a great demand
for it I might work with someone like Access Data (the people who write the
decryption software for a whole host of other programs) so people can recover
files they've forgotten the password for, but beyond investigating its security
I don't have that much interest in Diskreet.
 
Peter.

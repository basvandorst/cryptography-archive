The best on-line reference to public key crypto is:

Which is a 300k file with overview, nut-and-bolts, the math,
you name it. Excellent.  Also available and readable is:

Is quite good too. Although is more RSA Data Security specific.
You can get the RSA faq from rsa.com and the NIST doc from your favorite
crypto ftp site.  Like nic.funet.fi or black.ox.ac.uk.

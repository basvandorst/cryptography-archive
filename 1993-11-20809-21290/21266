Here's my suggestion for a "Paper and Pen"  encryption scheme.  It's
not original but perhaps the implementation's fun.  (Do it at your local
creche or playgroup?)

A Jefferson Cylinder for 7-12 year-olds.
========================================

You will need:

	2 sheets of blank paper.
	a pen or pencil.
	1 cardboard tube (ex-kitchen roll; toilet rolls are out).
	a roll of sticky tape.
	a pair of scissors.
	a brown paper bag.

Step 1: Making the alphabets.
=============================

	From one sheet of paper cut out 26 identical slips; write the
letters of the alphabet on the slips (one letter on each slip; no letter
repeated :-).  Put the letter slips into the paper bag.

	On the second sheet of paper rule 36 columns.  The distance from
the first column to the last should be a little less than the length of
the tube.

	Start at the first column: shake the paper bag vigourously; stir
the contents by hand; shake again.  Now remove the letter slips ona at a
time, writing the letter selected in the first column.  The height of
the column should be the same as the circumference of the tube.  When
all the letters have been removed and the column full, put the letters
back into the bag and repeat this procedure until all columns are full.

Step 2: Making the Rings.
=========================

	Carefully wrap the paper with the letters on around the
cardboard tube and trim it so that there is just the teeniest overlap. 
Stick the two edges together with sticky tape.  (If there's no overlap
the atpe may stick to the tube; you do not want this to happen).

	Remove the paper cylinder from the tube and flatten it
carefully.  You can now separate the columns by cutting them apart with
the scissors.  As each one is freed write a number on it, inside.  The
numbers 1 to 36 in numerical sequence suggest themselves.  Selecting the
rings at random, open each one and slide it on to the tube, noting the
sequence of numbers.

Step 3: Using the Cylinder.
===========================

	To communicate with someone else, get a friend to copy your
cylinder.  To encrypt your diary just follow the instructions.

Encryption:
-----------

	1) Rotate the rings on the tube to spell out the first 36
letters of your message.  (Grip the leftmost ring firmly with your left
hand; slide the next ring round gently with your right.  Easier to do
than describe).

	2) From _any_ other row read off the ciphertext (and write it in
your diary or in your letter).

	3) Do the same with each block of 36 letters.

Decryption:
-----------

	1) Copy the ciphertext onto the cylinder as described above for
plaintext.

	2) Rotate the cylinder until you see a line that makes sense. 
Write it down or, for added security, don't write it down.

(Note: if you find _two_lines that make sense write at once to the
Guinness Book of Records :-)

Key Management:
===============

	You can give lots of copies of your cylinder away to your
friends, relatives, whoever and you can still communicate secretly by
changing the order of rings on the cylinder.  This is your key.  There
are 36! or 3.72x10e41 possible keys which is secure enough to keep Dad
out of your diary.  If he works for the NSA you could be in trouble
though.

Have fun!

To order FIPS PUBS, call 301-975-2816 and ask for what you want.  They
are free (to US citizens anyway, probably to anybody) so all you have to
supply is an address.  The SHS is FIPS PUB 180 and DES is FIPS PUB 46 (but
there are some other related ones, I don't have the numbers in front of me).
They come via snail mail, but I got mine 3 or 4 days after I ordered the
SHS and DSS (DSS is still draft, no number has been assigned yet).

They are very, very terse documents.  I got hold of the MD4 papers to
understand where this stuff is coming from and why it's set up the way it
is.

Hope that helps!

Patience, persistence, truth,
Dr. mike

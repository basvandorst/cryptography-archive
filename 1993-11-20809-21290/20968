The encryption method is the same as 1.1, with a little twiddle to impede
dictionary type searches: ie it is much harder to reject incorrect passwords.
Depending on the compression method used, and the data file types, many
archives will have some files that are 'crackable' without discovering the
password.

I think it depends on the version, and whether it is the US domestic edition
or the export edition.  Sorry, I don't know the details.

Sorry, I don't know anything about that.

Perhaps not. It depends:

Apparently QS requires RSA. I don't think they can get a patent on that
since it's already published.

On the other hand, if the net GATT rules are passed, depending on whether
they were retroactive or not, RSA might get worldwide GATT member nation
patents.

Note that the above are possibilities, not "the truth."

Summary: How to transfer a password from an ID to an other ?
Keywords: passwords, crypt method

To backup several Portable Netware servers to one, I need to transfer the 
users accounts, including passwords.

As I must re-create accounts, they cannot have the same Netware ID. It seems
that the algorithm to generate the crypted password is ID dependant.
So when I copy the crypted, I don't have the same clear password instead of 
Unix for instance.

Where can I find a description of the crypt algorithm used ? Or better, is 
there a method to generate the crypted for an other ID ?

Please answer by e-mail.

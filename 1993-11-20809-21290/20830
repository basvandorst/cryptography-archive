I only have implementation experience (forced on me by boss) with the Glenco
Engineering Hardlock. For that one forget it. It's a little crypto engine.
They also suggest that implementations use decrypted results from the dongle
during routine program calculations (instead of constants for example) so that
programs hacked to get past the dongle check, *still* dont work. The
dongle-less hackers have even been known to turn themselves in to software
manufacturers, calling to report 'bugs', which are in reality incorrect
calculations caused by running the (hacked) program with no dongle! They
offer a free book on the theory of the thing. I forget what it's called and I
don't have access to their number offhand (sorry).

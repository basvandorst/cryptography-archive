The article was in EUROCRYPT 90, not Crypto 90, and the article is obsolete. 
It deals with an earlier version of the cipher which was subsequently 
strengthened to resist differential cryptanalysis.  The definitive published 
article on IDEA, again by Lai and Massey, is in EUROCRYPT 91. A discussion 
of the use of IDEA to create a powerful hash function is described in 
EUROCRYPT 92, again by our friends Lai and Massey. A more detailed 
description can be found in the book, "On the Design and Security of Block 
Ciphers" by Lai, 1992, published by Hartung-Gorre Verlag in, I believe, 
Konstanz, Germany. I had a heck of a time getting that book and if you 
want it, you could try Quantum Books in Cambridge, Mass. at 
quanbook@world.std.com. Although after their experience helping me, they 
may not be so keen for a second go-round!. 

The paper by Bruce provides a nice short write-up, but does contain an 
error in the diagram.

PGP uses it to encrypt the message body. The 128-bit IDEA key is carried in the 
message header, encrypted with an RSA public key.

The patent hasn't been awarded.  The article says protected by
Patent *Application* GB ... A.

Perhaps British law is different, but as I understand it "Patent Pending"
has absolutely no legal weight in the U.S.  In layman's terms, it
means:

   Hey bub, if you copy this item *and* we get a patent, we can
   sue you to keep from continuing to manufacture or sell your
   copies of this item.

It does not mean that the "infringer" of the then non-existent patent
has to pay royalties, turn over profits, whatever.

As a practical matter, does RSA have a patent on their algorithm in
Britain?   If RSA doesn't have a patent, how likely is it that QS will
actually be awarded a patent?

For a history paper I'm writing I would very much like to correspond
with members of the study group assembled at the end of World War II
by William F. Friedman to work on the Voynich Manuscript (a.k.a. Roger
Bacon Cipher Manuscript), about the activities of that group.  (This
is the group mentioned on page 870 of Kahn's *The Codebreakers* and
on page 168 of Clark's *The Man Who Broke PURPLE*.)

I realize that the intersection of sci.crypt readers with the 1940's
Voynich study group is probably empty.  But possibly someone who reads
this is related to, or is acquainted with, an old study group member.
If so, I would be grateful if you would pass my message on to him or
to her.

I would, of course, abide by any conditions of anonymity or confidentiality
my correspondents imposed.

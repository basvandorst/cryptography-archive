Are you serious?  I have records (and witnesses) to attest to the fact
that I came up with this algorithm (and coded it) last November.

Not only that, but I haven't even read the Computer Shopper quiz, or
whatever.  I was going to ask what it was.

So either this algorithm is really simple, and they're putting it in
there as an example, or the algorithm is pretty cool, and I happen to
come up with a version on my own, or someone at Computer Shopper has
been snooping in ~mikeb/.

;^)

Honestly, I have not read the magazine; I thought of this random
look-up table approach last fall.

Mike

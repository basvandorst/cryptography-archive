It depends on the algorithm. If it is a group, then encrypting a file
twice could be equivalent to encrypting it only once, with a different
key.

DES has been shown not to be a group, so this is not a problem.

The usually proposed alternative is to use it three times - encrypt
with one key, decrypt the result with another key, then encrypt the
result with a third key (a variant of this uses the first key again).

It depends on the methods. Usually, using additional encryption
doesn't reduce the security of the message, but it might also not
increase it either.

PGP already uses IDEA, which is believed to be about as strong as
tripple-DES.

If applied to the plaintext, it could dissort the frequencies of the
characters and make a brute-force attack more difficult. Often a
simple transposition is recommended between the levels of triple-DES.

At least I don't see any, but I am by no means an expert in this
field.

It is certainly possible - not for the whole Internet, of course, but
at least on some critical gateways that see a lot of traffic.

That can be tricially done by the administrator of the ftp site. Doing
it by somebody else is significantly more difficult. I am not sure
whether it can be done, unless the attacker has root access to a
machine which is on the same subnet as one of the machines involved in
the ftp transfer.

Don't know about the availability of the DES description on the net,
but IDEA is available as Chapter 3 of the Ph.D. of one of its
creators. The file can be obtained in PostScript form from our ftp
site:

ftp.informatik.uni-hamburg.de:/pub/virus/texts/crypto/idea.zip

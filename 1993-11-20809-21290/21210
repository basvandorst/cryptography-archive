  Is there anywhere I could ftp text files on manual methods of encryption?
  The one that I know and use the most is using the words and letters of
  book to encode a written message.  Are there more unique, yet subtle
  methods?  Especially methods where it wouldn't be clear that an 
  encrypted message even exists..  My messages usually look like this:

  2-35
  5-32
  3-65
  11-3
  2-61

  But I really want a system that is almost undetectable..  For that matter,
  any files on espionage/communication/whatever would be appreciated.

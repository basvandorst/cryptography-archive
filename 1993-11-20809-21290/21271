I was reading about the use of simple xor as the crypto protection for
many ms-dos programs. A qualatative description of how to break this scheme
was given and introduced some concepts I do not understand (after all, I
am as beginning as a beginner can be). The procedure was :
1)discover the length of the key by counting coincidences.
2)Once that is done shift the key that length and xor it with itself.
This removes the key and leaves you with test XORed with itself.
What is counting coincidences?
What does number 2 mean?
How can one count anything in a file that when printed is mostly
non keyboard characters?
thanks one and all
bob

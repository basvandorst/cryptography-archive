The idea of "reversible computation" is probably what Spencer is
thinking of. Charles Bennett and Rolf Landauer of the IBM Watson
Research Center are the main developers of this idea.

The idea that at least kT of energy must be dissipated in every
logical operation, due to a Maxwell's demon argument, is now in doubt.
The idea is that many computations (_all_ computations?) can be
reformulated so that intermediate results are saved and the bits are
not "thrown away" (capacitors discharged into heat, etc.). The
"billiard table" thought experiments of Fredkin, Toffoli, etc. are
instructive.

Whether Paul Ciszek's calculations would be dramatically affected is
another matter. The computational complexity grows very rapidly, and
even computers built using reversible logic will not ultimately be
able to keep up (actually, they'll run out of steam rather quickly).

One avenue to pursue is how many intermediate results need to be
stored. The Universe contains about 10^70 particles of all kinds,
which is a rather small number, so the time-space tradeoffs implicit
in complex calculations may give us limits similar to what Paul
calculated. 

Interesting books include: "The Physics of Computation," "Maxwell's
Demon," and "Comlexity, Entropy, and the Physics of Computation,"
(edited by W. Zurek).

I have heard from people who purchased the book at bookstores, so I know it
is out there somewhere.  Near as I can tell, no Barnes & Noble is carrying
the book yet, not even the stores with large programming sections.  If
enough people ask about the book there, maybe they will.

Baker & Taylor, and Ingram, are the two biggest book wholesalers in the
country.  Neither of those two have any books.  I don't believe Ingram has
ever received any, and Baker & Taylor is out.  I have no idea why the John
Wiley warehouse is so incompetant; I have an order for 100 books that has not
been filled in weeks.

The publishing industry is screwed up; what can I tell you.

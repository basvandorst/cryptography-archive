When breaking DES encryption (for instance), how do you know that you
have found the key?  Seems like software is needed which a) recognizes
plaintext and b) identifies the correct plaintext.  Is it assumed that
an encrypted file and corresponding plaintext are already provided?  This
would seem pretty useless (and hard to get) unless it was known that a
large quantity of information was encrypted using the same key.  I've
read various approaches for breaking DES through rigorous key search, 
but I don't recall seeing the method of determining when the key search
is successful.  Any help would be appreciated.

If at first you don't succeed, try playing second.

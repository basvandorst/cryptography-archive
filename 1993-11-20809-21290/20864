Hi, for an algorithms class I am in I need to present some information on how
different encryption algorithms work.

I have figured out the easy ones like caesar, vigenere, and vernam. I have also
spent some time putting the rules to Playfair in plain english, all the books I
can find on the subject are aimed towards the math involved. 

What I am now looking for is any information in as plain english as possible
about some of the other crypt algorithms, particularly the Public key
algorithm since it is discussed in out textbook a little so I will probably be
expected to have something on it. 

Right now I understand a little about the public key algorithm, I know about
the use of a 200 digit number and two 100 digit numbers. But from there our
textbook doesn't seem to be of much help to me. Also I will gladly accept any
information on other algorithms as well.

Thank-you to anyone who is able to help me out.

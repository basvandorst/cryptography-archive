the XOR function) are 110010.  The first and last bits combine to
form 10, which corresponds to row 2 of the sixth S-box.  The
middle four bits combine to form 1001, which corresponds to
column 9 of the same S-box.  The entry under row 3, column 9 of
S-box 6 is 0.  (Remember, we count rows and columns from 0, and
not from 1.)  The value 0000 is substituted for 110010.

    SecuDE Tool 2.1   Alias Services

The Alias subtool of SecTool provides comfor-
table alias file maintaining functions.

User aliases can be installed, changed, and
deleted, System aliases can be displayed.

SecTool takes care of save access to alias 
files (thus it's not advisable to edit them manually) and performs several consistency 
checks. 

#

Alias type setting:

 - Choose one of four possible alias types
   of which aliases shall be displayed in the 
   AliasList.
 - If type is not available in the selected
   alias file (User/System/both), the alias
   is displayed as "???".
 - If both files are selected, User's aliases
   are printed prior to System aliases if a 
   DName has several aliases of the same type 
   in different files.

   is searched in all attributes of alias entry's 
   alias string.

   played (if entry's origination file is not
   the actual one, switch setting to see selec- 
   tion).

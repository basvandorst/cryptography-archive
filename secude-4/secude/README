 SecuDE-4.1             11.8.93             (c) GMD Darmstadt 1993



 INSTALLATION OF SecuDE
 ======================

 Preparation
 -----------
 To install SecuDE, first cd to the secude/src/config directory in
 order  to  make  an appropriate CONFIG.make file for your system.
 Some  templates  are  included  (sun3.make, sun4.make etc.) which
 could  give  a rough approach to what you need. Particularly, the
 selection  of the appropriate arithmetic routines for RSA and DSA
 by ARCH is important.

 SecuDE  contains  also  a  collection  of  ISODE-8.0  routines in
 secude/src/isode.   These  routines  are  needed  for  the  ASN.1
 processing.  Therefore it could be necessary to make some changes
 in secude/src/include/isode/config.h. If you have your own ISODE-
 8.0   installation,  you  can  switch  off  the  isode  stuff  in
 CONFIG.make  (unset  DISODE)  and  use  your  own ISODE libraries
 instead. Check LDL in CONFIG.make in this case.

 Compile Options
 ---------------

 X.500 DUA Functionality
 -----------------------
 SecuDE-4.1 provides access to  directory-stored  public  security
 attributes.  Either  access  to  X.500 directories or access to a
 non-X.500  local  substitute  can  be  selected  at compile time,
 controlled  by  DX500  in  CONFIG.make.  X.500  directory  access
 requires  a  full ISODE-8.0 QUIPU installation and, if used in an
 open distributed environment, public network connectivity.

 X.500 DUA with Strong Authentication
 ------------------------------------
 SecuDE-4.1  can also  provide  the use of  strong  authentication
 methods  when  accessing public X.500  Directories (make variable
 STRONG in CONFIG.make). In this case, a security-enhanced version
 of ISODE-8.0 is necessary.  This  is  available via anonymous ftp
 from ftp.darmstadt.gmd.de, file  pub/secude/isode8-secude4.tar.Z.
 It comprises a complete  ISODE-8  distribution with  security en-
 hencements for the libdsap library. 

 Smartcard Support
 -----------------
 SecuDE  supports  the use of the GMD/GAO STARCOS smartcard system
 for algorithmic processing and storing of personal security data.
 This  system  supports  RSA  and  DES processing in the smartcard
 reader. RSA/DES processing by software and by STARCOS can be used
 simultaneously.  You  can  decide  at  compile  time  by  DSCA in
 CONFIG.make whether to use this system or not.

 X based window tools
 --------------------
 The subdirectory src/sectool  contains a  demonstrator version of
 our Openwindow3 based tool sectool which provides the user inter-
 face to the  personal security environment  (PSE).  This is still
 under development and has most of the intended functions  yet not
 implemented.  It only provides you a feeling what you can expect.
 Sectool requires an Openwindow3  installation and  will therefore
 be executable only on SUN systems. The use of Motif is under con-
 sideration.

 The subdirectory secxlock contains an  xlock  version which locks
 and unlocks your local X display on the basis of strong authenti-
 cation (with digital signatures) instead of your login password.
 It requires an X11R4 installation on your system. 

 Shared Libraries
 ----------------
 If  you want to use shared libraries instead of static libraries,
 check   the   corresponding   section   on  shared  libraries  in
 CONFIG.make.

 Installation
 ------------
 Now cd to secude/src and say 'make'.  Don't  mind  warnings  when 
 assembling div.s in the case ARCH = sparc.

 PATH environment variable
 -------------------------
 Make sure that your  PATH  examines the  current directory first.
 If this is not possible, say ./make instead of make. You can also 
 say 'install_secude' to avoid any problem with your  environment. 

 For   more   specific  make's  you  can  cd  to  each  particular
 secude/src-directory (e.g. secude/src/af or secude/src/crypt/rsa)
 and say 'make'.  This  makes  the  current  src-directory and all  
 underlying   directories  recursively.  Again  you  have  to  say 
 './make'  if your PATH environment variable does not start with a
 dot or colon.

 SecuDE Libraries
 ----------------
 After  installation, the secude/lib directory contains the SecuDE
 library libsecude.a which  comprises all  functions of SecuDE. In 
 addition, if the use of shared libraries is selected, it contains 
 the corresponding .so file.  To reconstruct the libsecude library 
 from the src directory cd to secude/src and say 'make lib'.  This
 puts all SecuDE .o files into the library  regardless of the date
 of the last change.

 SecuDE Utilities
 ----------------
 The secude/bin directory will contain all executable programs. In
 order to enforce the capability of gen_pse to create  subdirecto-
 ries in user's home directories (see  vol.2  section 1  parameter
 [ -H dir ] ),  this  utility  must be  installed with appropriate
 set-uid or set-gid flags. 

 SecuDE Documentation
 --------------------
 The  secude/doc  directory  contains  all available documentation
 including the  .tex,  .dvi and .ps files. The currently available 
 PEM-RFC's and drafts are collected in secude/doc/pem.

 Known Problems
 --------------
 If you want to install SecuDE-4.1 on a  Sun/4 platform with SunOS 
 4.1.1 using the arithmetic SPARC  assembler programs (ARCH=SPARC)
 and shared libraries, you will either get a core dump or an infi-
 nite loop during RSA key generation.  The  problem does not occur
 when you use SunOS 4.1.2 or 4.1.3.  

 To  bypass  this  problem you  should replace the 4.1.1 generated 
 object file  arintf.o from the libsecude.a  library  by the 4.1.3 
 pregenerated  object file in secude/lib/IMPORTS/arintf.o.  Simply 
 decommenting the line 

 #LIBIMPORTS = yes

 in CONFIG.make does the same.

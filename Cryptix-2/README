Cryptix-Java V2.2
=================

Benefits over Cryptix V2.0
==========================

	The library includes the following improvements:

	  * PGP support is much broader
	      - automatic key retrieval
	      - improved support for clear-signed and armoured messages
	      - character set conversions. 
	  * MIME classes
	  * SPEED and DES block cipher algorithms in Java
	  * documentation
	  * examples on RSA, algorithms, PGP, ...

	Hooks exist for native libraries but they are still not tested,
	as we have found the speed entirely adequate for most purposes.



Notes
=====

	This is a Java V1.02-compatible release.  It should work
	with Java 1.1, and a Java 1.1-only release is forthcoming.

	The API has changed, especially in the PGP area.

	Blowfish is not yet ported to Java.

	The auto loading of native libraries (if they are present) has
	not been tested.

	The namespace has changed:

            Old Space          New - V2.2
            java.math          cryptix.math
            java.crypt         cryptix.security
            java.crypt.rsa     cryptix.security.rsa

	This marks a migration to an all-Cryptix space, along the lines
	of the security API.

	This release follows the original Cryptix API model.  Future
	versions may include elements of the Security API.

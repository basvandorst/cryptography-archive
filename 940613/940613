This is the first vote for allowing this.  I wonder what the others in
the discussion think.

If we did allow this, it means that the issuer name does not
necessarily match the subject name of the issuer's certificate which
is next "up" in the chain.  In this case, I would expect an
application to always choose subject names instead of issuer names
when displaying a chain, since it is the subject names which are
vouched for.

<H2>Using just conventional encryption</H2>
<P>Sometimes you just need to encrypt a file the old-fashioned way, with
conventional single-key cryptography.  This approach is useful for
protecting archive files that will be stored but will not be sent to
anyone else.  Since the same person that encrypted the file will also
decrypt the file, public key cryptography is not really necessary. 
<P>To encrypt a plaintext file with just conventional cryptography,
type:
<PRE>
    pgp -c textfile
</PRE>
This example encrypts the plaintext file called textfile, producing a
ciphertext file called textfile.pgp, without using public key
cryptography, key rings, user IDs, or any of that stuff.  It prompts
you for a pass phrase to use as a conventional key to encipher the
file.  This pass phrase need not be (and, indeed, SHOULD not be) the
same pass phrase that you use to protect your own secret key.  Note
that PGP attempts to compress the plaintext before encrypting it.  
<P>PGP will not encrypt the same plaintext the same way twice, even if
you used the same pass phrase every time.

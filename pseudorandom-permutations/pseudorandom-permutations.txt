It's worth pointing out that when used this way DES is always carried
out in the "forward" direction, even during decryption.  Because of
this, the "scrambling" function used in the "ladder" only needs to be
a pseudorandom function; it does not have to be a pseudorandom
permutation like DES.  A hash function with a 128-bit input and a 64
bit output could be used for this purpose.

:  Conclusion

:  DES operations can be arranged into a "ladder-DES" constructs which
:  are especially-clean and familiar and seem to resist known attacks.
:  These constructs seem potentially stronger than normal DES and are
:  demonstrably faster than triple-DES.  Thus, ladder-DES could be a
:  reasonable candidate to replace DES.

These schemes have been the subject of much research in recent years.
The classic paper is [1], in which it is shown that three rounds in
the structure above are sufficient to prove perfectness (polynomial
time indistinguishability from a truly random permutation), provided
that the random functions are themselves perfect.

There have been many papers on schemes to reduce the key space by
using one of the pseudorandom functions more than once; a few examples
are given here.

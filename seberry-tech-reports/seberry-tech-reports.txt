" Highly Nonlinear Balanced Boolean Functions
 Satisfying   High Degree  Propagation Criterion"

ABSTRACT
Three of the most important nonlinearity criteria for
cryptographically strong functions are
balancedness,  nonlinearity and propagation criterion.
In this paper we study systematic methods for constructing
highly nonlinear balanced Boolean functions
satisfying the high degree propagation criterion.
In particular, we present a method for constructing
highly nonlinear balanced Boolean functions
on $V_{2k+1}$ satisfying the propagation criterion with respect to
{\em all but one\/} vectors in $V_{2k+1}$,
and a method for constructing highly nonlinear balanced
Boolean functions
on $V_{2k}$ satisfying the propagation criterion with respect to
{\em all but three\/} vectors in $V_{2k}$.
We then show that the vectors where the propagation criterion
is not satisfied can be moved upward  in such a way that
the  functions constructed on $V_{2k+1}$
satisfy the propagation criterion of degree $2k$,
while the function constructed  on $V_{2k}$
satisfy the propagation criterion of degree $\frac{4}{3}k$.
The moving technique does not alter the balancedness
and nonlinearity of the functions.
The methods are illustrated by concrete constructions
of such cryptographically strong functions.
The algebraic degrees of the functions are also discussed.

"New Solutions to the Problem of Access Control in a Hierarchy"

ABSTRACT
The access control problem in a hierarchical organization
consists of the management of information among a number
of users who are divided into different security classes
according to their suitability in accessing the information.
Within the scope of cryptography
the problem can be reduced to
generating a cryptographic key for each security class
in such a way
that the key of a security class can be used to derive 
the keys of all lower security classes.
This paper presents a new approach to solving the problem,
based on pseudo-random function families,
universal hash function families
and in particular, sibling intractable function families.
The approach is illustrated by two types of solutions.
The first type of solution allows keys of lower security classes
to be obtained indirectly from that of higher security classes
through the calculation of the keys of
all intermediate security classes,
while the second type of solution
allows keys of lower security classes
to be obtained directly from that of higher security classes
without involving other security classes.
A formal definition of security for
key generation schemes is introduced
and
the security of the proposed schemes is proven.
Issues in key management are also addressed
and several possible polices are suggested.
The proposed solutions have theoretical significance
in that their security relies only on 
the existence of any one-way function,
and they also have practical applications
in that they can be easily incorporated into
existing information systems.

"Nonlinearity and Propagation Characteristics of
Balanced Boolean Functions"

ABSTRACT
Three of the most important criteria for cryptographically
strong Boolean functions are 
the balancedness, the nonlinearity and the propagation criterion.
The main contribution of this paper
is to reveal a number of interesting properties
of balancedness and nonlinearity,
and to study systematic methods for constructing
Boolean functions that satisfy some or all of the three criteria.
We show that concatenating, splitting,
modifying and multiplying (in the sense of Kronecker)
sequences can yield
balanced Boolean functions with a very high nonlinearity.
In particular, we show that 
balanced Boolean functions obtained
by modifying and multiplying sequences
achieve a nonlinearity higher than
that attainable by any previously known construction method.
We also present methods for constructing
balanced Boolean functions that are  highly nonlinear
and satisfy the strict avalanche criterion (SAC).
Furthermore we present methods for constructing
highly nonlinear balanced Boolean functions
satisfying the propagation criterion with respect to
{\em all but one or three\/} vectors.
A technique is developed
to transform the vectors where the propagation criterion
is not satisfied in such a way that
the  functions constructed 
satisfy the propagation criterion of high degree
while preserving the balancedness
and nonlinearity of the functions.
The algebraic degrees of functions constructed are also discussed,
together with examples illustrating the various constructions.

"On Constructions and Nonlinearity of
Correlation Immune Functions"

ABSTRACT
A Boolean function is said to be correlation immune
if its output leaks no information about its input values.
Such functions have many applications in
computer security practices including the construction of key
stream generators from a set of shift registers.
Finding methods
for easy construction of correlation immune functions has been
an active research area since the introduction of the notion
by Siegenthaler. 
In this paper we study balanced correlation immune
functions using the theory of Hadamard matrices.
First we present a simple method for directly constructing
balanced correlation immune functions of any order. 
Then we prove that our method
generates exactly the same set of functions as that
obtained using a method by Camion, Carlet, Charpin and Sendrier.
Advantages of our method
over Camion et~al's include
(1) it allows us to calculate the nonlinearity,
which is a crucial criterion for cryptographically strong functions,
of the functions obtained,
and (2) it enables  us to discuss the propagation characteristics
of the functions.  Two examples are given to
illustrate our construction method.
Finally, we investigate methods for obtaining
new correlation immune functions from
known correlation immune functions.
These methods provide us with a new avenue towards
understanding correlation immune functions.

"Improving the Strict Avalanche Characteristics of
Cryptographic Functions"

ABSTRACT
This letter presents a simple yet effective
method for transforming Boolean functions
that do not satisfy the strict avalanche criterion (SAC)
into ones that satisfy the criterion.
Such a method has a wide range of applications
in designing cryptographically strong functions,
including substitution boxes (S-boxes) employed
by common key block encryption algorithms.

"HAVAL --- A One-Way Hashing Algorithm 
with Variable Length of Output"

ABSTRACT
A one-way hashing algorithm is a deterministic
algorithm that compresses an arbitrary long message into 
a value of specified length.
The output value represents  the fingerprint or digest of the message.
A cryptographically useful property of a one-way hashing algorithm
is that it is infeasible
to find two distinct messages 
that have the same fingerprint. 
This paper proposes a one-way hashing  algorithm called HAVAL.
HAVAL compresses a message of arbitrary length into a fingerprint of
128, 160, 192, 224 or 256 bits.
In addition, HAVAL has a parameter that controls 
the number of passes a message block (of 1024 bits) is processed.
A message block can be processed in 3, 4 or 5 passes.
By combining output length with pass,
we can provide fifteen (15) choices for 
practical applications where different levels of security are required.
The algorithm is very efficient and particularly suited for
32-bit computers which predominate the current workstation market.  
Experiments show that HAVAL is
$60\%$ faster than MD5 when 3 passes are required,
$15\%$ faster than MD5 when 4 passes are required,
and
as fast as MD5 when full 5 passes are required.
It is conjectured that finding two collision messages
requires the order of $2^{n/2}$ operations,
where $n$ is the number of bits in a fingerprint.

"Systematic Generation of Cryptographically Robust S-boxes"

ABSTRACT
Substitution boxes (S-boxes) are a crucial component
of DES-like block ciphers.
This research addresses problems with previous approaches
towards constructing S-boxes,
and proposes a new definition for the robustness of
S-boxes to differential cryptanalysis,
which is the most powerful cryptanalytic attack known to date.
A novel method based on group Hadamard matrices
is developed to systematically generate S-boxes
that {\em simultaneously\/} satisfy a number of critical
cryptographic properties.
Among the properties are
the high nonlinearity, 
the strict avalanche characteristics,
the balancedness,
the robustness against differential cryptanalysis,
and the immunity to linear cryptanalysis.
An example is provided to illustrate
the S-box generating method.

"Amending Leighton and Micali's Key Distribution Protocol"

ABSTRACT
A key distribution protocol is 
a set of rules by which 
two users can establish a shared common key
between them and
then use the key in future secure communications.
We analyze a key distribution protocol
presented by Leighton and Micali at the CRYPTO'93 conference,
which is based on tamper-proof hardware,
and show that 
the protocol fails in that
a common key shared between two users
can always be obtained by a number of other
legitimate users in a system
where the proposed protocol is employed.
An interesting point is that
the legitimate users can derive the key
without opening a single tamper-proof chip.
We also propose a very simple identity based
conference key distribution protocol 
that frees of the flaw possessed 
by Leighton and Micali's protocol.
Furthermore, we employ ideas behind our protocol
to successfully repair Leighton and Micali's failed protocol.

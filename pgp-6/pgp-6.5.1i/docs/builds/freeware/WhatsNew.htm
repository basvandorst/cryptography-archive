<p><a NAME="NewFeatures"></a><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>NEW
FEATURES IN 6.5.1</font></font></b>
<ol>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>PGPnet. </b>PGPnet is a landmark product
in the history of PGP. PGPnet secures all TCP/IP communications between
itself and any other machine running PGPnet. PGPnet has been successfully
tested with Cisco routers(requires Cisco IOS 12.0(4) or later with IPSec
TripleDES), Linux FreeS/WAN, and many others.</font></li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>Self-Decrypting Archives. </b>You may now
encrypt files or folders into Self-Decrypting Archives (SDA) which can
be used by users who do not even have PGP. The archives are completely
independent of any application, compressed and protected by PGP's strong
cryptography.</font></li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>Integrated PGP Command Line.</b> This version
incorporates the popular command line version of PGP for Windows platforms.
This product provides you a convenient way to integrate PGP with other
Windows applications and automated processes on your desktop system. Please
note that this is intended for single user/workstation use. For use on
servers, customers are required to purchase the PGP Command Line/Batch
Server product. Please contact your local Network Associates Sales representative
for more information.</font></li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>Automated Freespace Wiping.</b> PGP's Freespace
Wipe feature now allows you to use the Windows Task Scheduler to schedule
periodic secure wiping of the freespace on your disk.</font></li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>Hotkeys.</b> The Use Current Window feature
has been significantly enhanced by the addition of Hotkeys. By pressing
the configured key combination, the Encrypt/Decrypt/Sign functions can
be automatically invoked in zero clicks without using PGPtray.</font></li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>Fingerprint Word List.</b> When verifying
a PGP public key fingerprint, you can now choose to view the fingerprint
as a word list instead of hexadecimal characters. The word list in the
fingerprint text box is made up of special authentication words that PGP
uses and are carefully selected to be phonetically distinct and easy to
understand without phonetic ambiguity.</font></li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>Support for Outlook 2000 and Outlook Express
5.0. </b>This version of PGP adds support for sending and receiving encrypted
e-mail in Microsoft Outlook 2000 and Outlook Express 5.0.</font></li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>HTTP Proxy Support.</b> If you are behind
a corporate firewall with an HTTP proxy server, PGP now supports accessing
HTTP keyservers through the proxy. To use this feature, you must configure
the proxy server address in your Internet Explorer preferences.</font></li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>Smart Word Wrapping.</b> The word wrapping
in PGP now automatically rewraps paragraphs and even quoted paragraphs
resulting in much cleaner signed messages.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><a NAME="SysReqs"></a><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>SYSTEM
REQUIREMENTS</font></font></b>
<p><b><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">To install PGP on a Windows 95, 98,
or NT system, you must have:</font></i></b>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Windows 95, 98, or NT 4.0 with Service Pack
3/4/5</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">32 MB RAM</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">16 MB hard disk space for the Client install</font></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<b><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If you plan to run PGPnet on the system,
you must also have:</font></i></b>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Microsoft TCP/IP</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">A compatible LAN/WAN network adapter</font></li>
</ul>
</ul>

<dir>
<dir><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Note: PGPnet functionality is not available
for users of Windows 95a (the original release of Windows 95). PGPnet supports
Windows 95b (OSR2), Windows 98 and Windows NT 4.0.</font></dir>
</dir>
<a NAME="Issues"></a><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>KNOWN
ISSUES</font></font></b>
<p><b><i><u><font face="Arial,Helvetica">PGP ISSUES</font></u></i></b>
<ol>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">The maximum size for RSA keys is 2048 bits.
This is due to limitations in the RSA libraries and our desire to remain
backward-compatible with previous versions of PGP. (Some previous versions
of PGP did function with large RSA keys, but creation of these keys has
never been supported.)</font></li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mismatching your keyring files can result
in data loss. Your public keyring file and private keyring file must be
kept in sync. If, for instance, you select a public keyring file that does
not contain the public portion of your private key and do not also change
the private keyring to the corresponding file, you and others will not
be able to encrypt to exported versions of your key after that time. In
most cases, simply updating your key from a public copy on a keyserver
will fix this. However, it is recommended that the keyring files always
be kept in sync. A future version is expected to correct this issue.</font></li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Some PGP Versions 6.0 and later features are
incompatible with previous versions of PGP, so we feature a "compatible"
export format that strips incompatible features such as Photo IDs and X.509
certificates from keys. Selecting "Include 6.X Extensions" in the Export
dialog enables these features to be exported. By default, we export in
compatible mode. You may change the default in the Advanced preferences
dialog. When sending a key to a PGP Certificate Server Version 2.0 or above,
Photo IDs always accompany the key. The default LDAP server in PGP 6.x
supports this.</font></li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">On Windows 95/98, the Free Space Wiper will
reset every time another program writes to your disk while the wiping process
is in progress. This is similar to defragmentation programs, and is required
by the Operating System. For optimal wiping, make sure to close all open
applications. On some systems with very low amounts of RAM, it may be advisable
to also shutdown Windows Explorer.</font></li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Windows Explorer provides PGP with information
only about the target of a shortcut and not the shortcut itself. If you
use the Wipe feature in the Explorer, the shortcut itself will not be wiped.
The actual target will be wiped. When using PGPtools, the shortcut will
also be wiped.</font></li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Hotkeys are for use with applications that
support general text editing. Using Hotkeys with some applications may
result in unpredictable behavior.</font></li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Versions of PGP later than 5.0 do not support
using Microsoft Word as an email editor.</font></li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">We strongly recommend that VirusScan users
upgrade to the latest version of VirusScan to take advantage of the newest
virus DAT file update features.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><br><b><i><u><font face="Arial,Helvetica">PGPNET ISSUES</font></u></i></b>
<ol>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Do not attempt to manually uninstall PGPnet.
It is very important that you use the PGP Uninstaller to remove PGPnet.
PGPnet makes extensive modifications to the registry and changes the bindings
on network adapters. The PGP Uninstaller can be accessed via the Add/Remove
Programs control panel.</font></li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">[Windows NT only] As a precautionary measure,
in the unusual event that there is a incompatibility between your network
card driver and PGPnet, you can create a "No Networking" hardware profile
prior to installing PGPnet on your system. The "No Networking" hardware
profile can be used later if an incompatibility occurs.</font></li>

<p><br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">To create a "No Networking" hardware
profile, right click on "My Computer," select Properties, and then select
the Hardware Profiles tab. Use the Copy button to create a copy of the
Original Configuration. Get Properties on your copied configuration and
click the Network tab. Finally, select the "Network-disabled hardware profile"
checkbox. Click OK to both windows and then you are done. (Due to a Windows
bug we recommend that you restart once and double-check that the "No Networking"
configuration is working before you install PGPnet.)</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">[Windows 95 only] You may experience a loss
of networking after resuming from standby mode. You must reboot your machine
to resume network activity.</font></li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">PGPnet 6.5.1 is not compatible with the Intel
EtherExpress 16 driver.</font></li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">This freeware version of PGP disables the
use of X.509 authentication with PGPnet, and also does not allow the use
of Secure Gateways for tunneling. Only the Personal Privacy and Desktop
Security versions support these features.</font></li>

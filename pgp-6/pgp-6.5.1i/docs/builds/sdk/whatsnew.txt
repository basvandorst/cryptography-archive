NEW FEATURES 

1. Expanded X.509 certificate support.
   X.509 certificate requests can be created for 
   existing PGP keys.  Additionally, existing X.509 
   certificates can be imported onto a PGP key ring.
   The PGPsdk recognizes X.509 certificate revocation 
   lists (CRLs) and incorporates the revoked certificate 
   information therein into validity calculations for 
   imported X.509 certificates.

2. X.509 Certificate Authority (CA) support.
   The PGPsdk supports performing online certificate 
   requests and retrievals, CRL retrievals from Network
   Associates Net Tools PKI 1.0, VeriSign OnSite PKI 4.0, 
   and Entrust PKI 4.0 (using the Entrust VPN Connector
   4.1).

3. X.509 TLS support. 
   X.509 certificates and certificate chains can now 
   be used to authenticate a PGP Transport Layer 
   Security (TLS) session.

4. X.509 private key import. 
   X.509 private keys created with other products (e.g.,
   web browsers, etc.) can now be imported into a PGP 
   keyring using the PKCS #8 or #12 interchange formats.

5. Low-level session key support.   
   The session key used to encrypt a PGP message can
   now be retrieved during encryption and a message 
   can be explicitly encrypted using a given session 
   key. This feature allows for decrypting a specific 
   message without explicit knowledge of the passphrase
   for the private key if the session key for 
   the message is known.

6. Random pool security enhancement.
   Additions to the random pool are bufferred
   internally to impede state-following attacks.

7. Miscellaneous.
   - DSS key sizes are now forced to be multiple of
     64 bits as required by the standard.
   - The internal limit on the number of outstanding
     key sets have been increased approximately five
     fold.

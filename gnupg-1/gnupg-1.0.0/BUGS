[  *] #3
    --list-packets should continue even w/o a passphrase (or in batch
    mode).  Maybe we have to move it to a separate program??

[  *] #4  1999-01-13 <ralf.stephan@fitug.de> 0.9.1
    v3 key 'expiration date' problem:
       1. generate a key, set expiration date
       2. <do other things, deleting etc.>
       3. edit a v3 secret key, try to set expiration date
       - output: "You can't change...
       4. save
       5. key has expiration date from 1. and gpg reports that pubkey
	  and seckey differ.
    The for loop the exp.date is set before v3 detection?
    [is this bug still alive? - can someone please check it]

[ **] #6 1999-02-22 <backes@rhrk.uni-kl.de> 0.9.3
    Bus error on IRIX 6.4: Crash while doing a keygen. I think while creating
    the prime.	Other bus errors are reported when doing a "gpg README"
    on sparc-solaris2.6.
    --> Solaris fixed.
    --> IRIX bug still there but someone should test this again!

[  *] #18 1999-05-27 <Steffen.Zahn@icn.siemens.de> 0.9.7
    rndunix hangs on hp/ux.  The problem is related to my_plcose which is
    not always called.	(I suggest to use EGD instead of rndunix.)

[  *] #22 1999-07-22
    Solaris make has problems with the generated POTFILES - seems to be a
    gettext bug.  Use GNU gmake as a workaround.

[  *] #23 1999-09-03 <todd.brooks@yale.edu> 0.9.11
    Only the first signature of a cleartext sig seems to be verified.
    Can't fix it in 1.0 because the code is semi-frozen.

[  *] #24 1999-09-05 <marcus@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au> 0.9.11
    Does not link libc and libz expect when removing all "-lc -lz" except
    for the last one.  This happens on some systems when not using the
    GNU ld.  This need to be fixed in libtool.


Next #25

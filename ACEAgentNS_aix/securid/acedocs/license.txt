AT THE END OF THE LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS STATED BELOW, YOU WILL BE ASKED TO ACCEPT OR REJECT SUCH TERMS.  BY INDICATING YOUR ACCEPTANCE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT.

This is a legal agreement between the end user ("You") and Security Dynamics Technologies, Inc. ("SDI"). This Agreement may be superceded by a previously agreed to and signed Software License Agreement

LICENSE AGREEMENT

1.	GRANT OF LICENSE.  SDI grants You a non-exclusive, non-transferable license, to use one copy of the following SDI software program in object form only (the "SOFTWARE") in accordance with the instructions contained in its user documentation.

2.	COPYRIGHT.  The SOFTWARE, its component parts and user interface, and associated documentation, are owned by SDI or its suppliers and are protected by United States laws and international treaty provisions.  Therefore, You must treat the SOFTWARE and SDI documentation like any other copyrighted materials except that you may  (a) make copies of the SOFTWARE solely for backup and archival purposes, and (b) make a reasonable number of copies of the user documentation for your internal use only, provided all copyright notices, trademarks and other proprietary legends contained on the original SOFTWARE are reproduced on the copies and that they are not removed from the original SOFTWARE itself.

3.	OTHER RESTRICTIONS.  You may not cause or permit disclosure, copy (except as permitted above), rent, license, sublicense, lease, disseminate or distribute the SOFTWARE, by any means or in any form, without the prior written consent of SDI. You may not modify, enhance, supplement create derivative work from, adapt, translate, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or otherwise reduce the SOFTWARE to human readable form.  

4.	LIMITED WARRANTY.  SDI grants a limited warranty only to You that the SOFTWARE will perform substantially in accordance with the accompanying documentation prepared by SDI for a period of 90 days from the date of receipt by You.  Any and all related and subsequent support issues shall be directed to the party you purchased this license from, unless you have entered into a separate support service contract directly with SDI.

5.	CUSTOMER REMEDIES.  SDI's entire liability and your exclusive remedy for breach of the Limited Warranty shall be at SDI's option, either (a) return of the price paid by You solely for the SOFTWARE and which is returned to SDI and determined by SDI not to be in compliance,  or (b) repair and replacement of the SOFTWARE which does not meet SDI's Limited Warranty.  Any replacement SOFTWARE will be warranted for the remainder of the original warranty period or 30 days, whichever is longer.  The Limited Warranty is void if failure of the SOFTWARE has resulted from causes other than normal use, including but not limited to, unauthorized repairs, maintenance or modifications to the SOFTWARE, accident, abuse, negligence, misapplication, or failure to use the SOFTWARE in accordance with the SDI user documentation. THE FOREGOING EXPRESS WARRANTIES ARE IN LIEU OF ALL LIABILITIES OR OBLIGATIONS ON THE PART OF SDI.  SDI AND ITS SUPPLIERS DISCLAIM ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, BOTH EXPRESS AND IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE, ITS QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE AND THE ACCOMPANYING WRITTEN MATERIALS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  The Limited Warranty specified above gives You specific legal rights.  You may have others which vary from state to state.  Some states do not allow limitations of duration of an implied warranty, so the above may not apply to You.

6.	LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  In no event shall SDI or its Suppliers be liable for any special, indirect, consequential, EXEMPLARY  or incidental damages whatsoever (including, without limitation, damage for loss of business profits, business interruption, loss, damage or destruction of data, loss of good will, or other pecuniary loss) whether based in contract or tort, including negligence, arising out of the use of or inability to use the SOFTWARE, even if SDI OR ITS SUPPLIERS haVE been advised of the possibility of such damages.  Because some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, the above limitation may not apply to you.

7.	GENERAL.  This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between SDI and You with respect to subject matter hereof.  Terms and  conditions of set forth in any purchase order or other extraneous documents (except for previously agreed to and signed to Software License Agreements) which differ from, conflict with, or are not included in this License Agreement, shall not become part of this Agreement unless specifically accepted by SDI in writing.

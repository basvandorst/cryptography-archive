&nbsp;Tokenholder Responsibilities </b></font></h1>

<hr>

<p><font color="#000000">You are responsible for protecting the
authentication factors entrusted to you. Keep your PIN secret and
protect your SecurID token against loss and theft. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">If an unauthorized person learns your
PIN and obtains your SecurID token, this person can assume your
identity. Any action taken by this intruder will be attributed to
you in the system&#146;s security log. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">For your own protection and that of the
system, always take the following precautions: </font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font color="#000000">Never reveal your PIN to anyone. Do
        not write it down. </font></li>
    <li><font color="#000000">If you think someone has learned
        your PIN, notify the security administrator, who will
        clear the PIN immediately. At your next login you will
        have to receive or create a new PIN to use. </font></li>
    <li><font color="#000000">If you have a PINPAD, clear the PIN
        from your card by pressing the <b>P</b> key as soon as
        your PASSCODE has been accepted. </font></li>
    <li><font color="#000000">Exercise care not to lose your
        SecurID token or to allow it to be stolen. If your token
        is missing, tell an administrator immediately. The
        administrator will disable it so that it is useless to
        unauthorized users. </font></li>
    <li><font color="#000000">Do not let anyone access the system
        under your identity or log in with your PIN and a code
        from your SecurID token. </font></li>
    <li><font color="#000000">It is essential to site security
        that you follow your system&#146;s standard logoff
        procedures. Failure to log off properly can create a
        route into the system that is completely unprotected. </font></li>
    <li><font color="#000000">Protect your token from physical
        abuse. Do not immerse it in liquids, do not expose it to
        extreme temperatures, and do not put it under pressure or
        bend it. Each SecurID token comes with care instructions
        that you should read and follow. </font></li>
</ul>

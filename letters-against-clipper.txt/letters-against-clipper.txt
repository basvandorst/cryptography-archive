Dear Senator/Congressman/President {fill in the blank}

I am writing you to voice my strong opposition to President Clinton's Clipper 
Chip initiative. This proposal to establish a secret government designed
cryptography chip with government key registration as the standard for voice
encryption is very disturbing. The idea that citizens must register their 
secrets with the government just in case they are trying to keep them secret 
is patently unAmerican. Additionally, the press release for this program
strongly implied that other forms of cryptography would be banned after the 
Clipper Chip standard is in place. This latest attack on our civil rights is 
deeply disturbing and is frankly a voting issue for me. 

The presidents press release stated that the plan strikes a balance between the
legitimate needs of law enforcement and a citizens right to privacy but this 
is not the case. The fact is that since other strong cryptographic equipment 
is avalible the criminals, drug dealers and terrorists mentioned in the press 
release will simply use non clipper cryptography. Meanwhile the average citizen
may gain no protection against warentless wiretaps by the government since the 
government escrowed key is derived deterministicly from the unit serial number
which is broadcast by the chip durring its opperation. This seems like an 
obvious back door for the NSA and law enforcement. If you still do nott 
understand my objection to key registration, consider the way J. Edgar Hoover 
blackmailed government officials like yourself; would you now use a phone to 
transmit personal details of your life that the NSA and FBI have the keys to?

The compuserve mailbox overflowed.  This one doesn't.

I don't know how often they print and carry mail but I have received
confirmation of receipt within 2 hours of each message I've sent.

They *do* print it on paper and carry it over, BTW.

I received a fax of a letter from Representative Markey (Subcommittee on 
Telecommunications and Finance) to Ron Brown (Secretary of Commerce).  Since 
encryption and the Clipper chip are raised in this letter, I felt it would be
of interest.  I understand that on 29 April, Mr. Markey will be holding a
hearing on the questions raised in this letter.  There may also be a follow-on
hearing dedicated to the clipper chip, but that's not definite.

I've typed in the letter, which follows.  Any errors in transcription are 
mine...

April 19, 1993

The Honorable Ronald H. Brown
Secretary
Department of Commerce
14th and Pennsylvania Ave., NW
Washington, DC 20236

Dear Secretary Brown:

   As you know, I have long been interested in the privacy 
and security of telecommunications transmissions and data in 
a networked environment.  Recent reports concerning the 
Administration's endorsement of an electronic encryption 
standard, based upon "clipper chip" technology, have raised a 
number of related issues.  The international competitiveness 
of U.S. high tech manufacturers and the software industry is 
a key factor that the government should consider when 
addressing issues of encryption and data security.  As the 
nation moves forward in developing the national 
communications and information infrastructure, security of 
telecommunications transmissions and network data will be an 
increasingly important factor for protecting the privacy of 
users.

   The "hacker" community can compromise the integrity of 
telecommunications transmissions and databases linked by the 
network.  The people and businesses that use the nation's 
telecommunications network and the personal computers linked 
through it increasingly are demanding that information be 
protected against unauthorized access, alteration, and theft.

   I am concerned that the Administration's plan may mean 
that to remain competitive internationally, U.S. companies 
would be compelled to develop two products -- one for U.S. 
government customers, and another for private, commercial 
users who may want a higher encryption standard.  This may 
inadvertently increase costs to those U.S. companies hoping 
to serve both markets.  To assist the Subcommittee's analysis 
of this issue, please respond to the following questions:

1. Has the encryption algorithm or standard endorsed by the 
Administration been tested by any entity other than NSA, NIST 
or the vendor?  If so, please identify such entities and the 
nature of testing performed.  If not, please describe any 
plans to have the algorithm tested by outside experts and how 
such experts will be chosen.

2. Under the Administration's plan, what entities will be the 
holders of the "keys" to decrypt scrambled data?  What 
procedures or criteria will the Administration utilize to 
designate such key holders?

3. Does the encryption algorithm endorsed by the 
Administration contain a "trap door" or "back door," which 
could allow an agency or entity of the Federal government to 
crack the code?

4. It is clear that over time, changes in technologies used 
for communications will require new techniques and additional 
equipment.  How will encryption devices adapt to the rapid 
advancement of telecommunications technology?

5. What additional costs would the proposed encryption place 
on the Federal government?  What is the estimated cost to 
consumers and businesses which opt for the federal standard 
in their equipment?

6. What is the Commerce Department's assessment of the 
competitive impact of the Administration's endorsement of the 
"clipper chip" technology on U.S. exports of computer and 
telecommunications hardware and software products?

   I would appreciate your response by no later than close-
of-business, Wednesday, April 28, 1993.  If you have any 
questions, please have your staff contact Colin Crowell or 
Karen Colannino of the Subcommittee staff at (202) 226-2424.

Sincerely,

Edward J. Markey
Chairman

The Honorable Dan Hamburg,
representing the 1st District
 
(attn: Paul Anderson, Legislative Aide,
Communications)

Re:  President Clinton's "Clipper Chip" wiretap proposal
 
On April 16, 1993 the Office of the Press Secretary for President 
Clinton announced an initiative to standardize communications 
privacy through encryption using solid-state technology developed 
by the National Security Agency.  This chip ("The Clipper Chip"), 
already proposed for inclusion by AT&T in several 
telecommunications products, has a built-in 'back door' that permits 
law enforcement agencies to monitor the messages undetectably.
 
The administration proponents argue that the "key" to the 
telephone can only be obtained upon warrant from trusted escrow 
houses and that this kind of monitoring capability is necessary to 
prevent criminal conspiracy from flourishing.
 
I disagree strongly with this initiative for several technical and
social reasons.
 
Privacy is indeed desirable and we need technical and social measures
that can assure it.  However, as historical events have shown we 
need protection from the government as least as much as protection 
from other citizens.  Illegal wiretapping of the Weathermen as 
revealed by Federal Judge Damon J. Keith (the 'Keith Case') in 
1971, Richard Nixon's 'watch lists', and the notorious NSA project 
Minaret and project Shamrock involving warrantless monitoring of 
domestic individuals and organizations supports the idea that the 
NSA deems its secretive national security mission more important 
than the law or our individual civil rights.  Nor is the NSA the only 
agency that has disregarded our civil rights in search for 'national 
security'.  For example, in December 1974 Seymour Hersh reported 
in the New York Times the details of Operation Chaos, an illegal 
CIA spying program directed against Americans.  The list is long of 
government wiretap abuses.
 
Technically, the Clipper chip proposal is flawed because the 
specifications for the chip remained classified, contrary to normal 
scientific peer review standards.  We citizens cannot verify the 
correct functioning of this technology nor its capacity for its abuse of 
our right to privacy.  We must trust the NSA to exclusively guard 
our civil rights, which we know is unwise.
 
Wiretapping now and under this new proposal can be done 
undetectably.  There is no technical means to assure us citizens that 
the government has a proper warrant.  The only means we citizens 
have of currently assuring privacy, even from government 
wiretapping, is through strong cryptography.  And this initiative 
explicitly questions our use of this strong cryptography in the 
passage: "We [the administration] are not saying that every 
American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an unbreakable 
commercial encryption product."
 
I disagree.  I believe that we individual do have the right to be 
secure in our papers and effects and our expressions of ideas 
telephonically, digitally, or by any other means.  I believe that the 
government ought to regulate our overt actions in our dealings with 
other people, not to regulate our private expression of ideas to 
ourselves or to others.
 
This initiative even goes further to erode our right to privacy 
because each encoded conversation will be tagged with a unique 
serial number that would allow collection of warrantless collection 
of conversations from the comfort of remote headquarters with just 
the flick of a switch.  This call 'tracking' is a potentially dangerous 
new capability that the government wants in monitoring its citizens.  
Under a recent Federal Court decision (the 'Steve Jackson Games' 
case), the judge ruled that mere collection of digital messages 
without a warrant was not the same as an 'intercept' which is 
forbidden by Federal Law.  This ruling coupled with the new 
'serialized message' Clipper chip technology means that all of our 
conversations can legally be collected and warehoused for use at any 
future time.  Although the initiative stresses that the inclusion of 
Clipper technology into phones, modems, and computer networks is 
purely voluntary (at this time), this serializing represents a dangerous 
new capability for government intrusion into our unencumbered 
expression of ideas.
 
And of course determined criminals can use technology developed 
outside the United States to evade this new initiative anyway.  The 
administration's suggestion that this technology will thwart terrorist 
or drug traffickers is grossly overstated and misleading.
 
We all don't want criminals to evade proper warrants with the new 
secure encryption technologies, but the danger to our civil rights of 
this new Clipper Chip initiative and the signs that the government 
will use its wide dissemination to justify outlawing truly strong 
cryptography 'to fight drug traffickers and terrorists' in the future, is 
extremely troubling to me.
 
I would much prefer a that some criminals have secure conversations 
than the bulk of our citizens having their constitutional right to 
privacy reserved by the fourth and tenth amendment to the 
Constitution eroded.
 
Funding for the Clipper chip initiative should be axed unless with 
some reasonable certainty we citizens can assure ourselves of its 
guarantee of due process and protection of our civil rights.  
Congressman Edward J. Markey has also questioned the wisdom of 
this proposal; you may want to contact his office to consolidate 
information.
						    			
Very truly yours,
 
Grady Ward

                         FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT

         The CAYLEY/MAGMA Conference on Computational Algebra

                     London, August 23 - 27, 1993

An instructional conference on Computational Algebra and the new MAGMA system
for Algebra and Number Theory will be held at Queen Mary and Westfield College,
London, August 23 - 27, 1993. The conference is being held to mark
the international launch of MAGMA and it will focus on the state of the art in
algorithmic algebra.

Building on a decade of experience with the CAYLEY system, the Computational
Algebra Group at the University of Sydney, with the generous assistance of
algebraists from many different countries, has designed the MAGMA system.
This system provides an integrated facility for solving hard computational
problems in the major families of algebraic structures, viz. groups, rings,
fields and modules.

MAGMA has a functional-style programming language in which the principal
data types are sets, sequences, structures (magmas) and mappings. The
kernel contains efficient implementations of many of the principal algorithms
in Module Theory, Ring Theory, Group Theory, Algebraic Number Theory
and Algebraic Combinatorics.

Each of the morning sessions of the Conference will consist of lectures on
current developments in one of the above areas of computational algebra, while
the afternoons will be devoted to instructional presentations of corresponding
features in the new MAGMA system.  Ample opportunities will be provided for
participants to gain hands-on experience with the system.

Papers are sought from intending participants describing:

(*) Algorithmic methods in Module Theory, Ring Theory, Group Theory, Algebraic
Number Theory or Algebraic Combinatorics,

(*) Research applications of CAYLEY or MAGMA, or

(*) The impact of computer techniques on research in algebra and related areas.

People who are interested in attending the Conference or who wish
to receive further announcements should contact

                         SECOND ANNOUNCEMENT

         The CAYLEY/MAGMA Conference on Computational Algebra

                 QUEEN MARY AND WESTFIELD COLLEGE

                London, August 23 - August 27 1993


An instructional conference on Computational Algebra and the new MAGMA system
for Algebra and Number Theory will be held at Queen Mary and Westfield College,
London, August 23 - August 27, 1993. The Conference is being held to mark the 
international launch of MAGMA and it will focus on the state of the art in 
algorithmic algebra. 

				MAGMA

Recent advances in Computational Algebra have strongly emphasized the growing
inter-dependence between the various branches of the field. Thus, the new
Holt-Rees technique for splitting KG-modules makes heavy use of factorization 
of polynomials over finite fields. Bosma and H.W. Lenstra Jr have recently used
the Groebner basis technique for polynomial rings to determine minimal systems 
of addition laws for elliptic curves. The Leedham-Green algorithm for computing
the order of a matrix over GF(q) depends upon the ability to factor integers of
the form p^n - 1. Up until the present, advanced algorithms for the various 
branches of algebra, geometry and number theory have tended to be implemented 
in packages designed for a very specific area: E.g. CAYLEY, COCOA, KANT, 
Macaulay, Pari, SAC, SIMATH. In order to provide mathematicians with the 
ability to write programs which may utilize the algorithmic machinery from 
these diverse fields, the Computational Algebra Group at Sydney University has 
designed a new system, known as MAGMA which provides a *unified enviroment* for
efficient computation in the principal structures of modern algebra viz. groups,
rings, fields and modules. This system extends the ideas of *structural 
computation*, successfully developed for group theory over the past two decades
in the CAYLEY system, to algebra generally.

MAGMA has a functional-style programming language in which the principal data 
types are sets, sequences, structures (magmas) and mappings. The kernel 
contains efficient implementations of many of the principal algorithms in 
Module Theory, Ring Theory, Group Theory, Algebraic Number Theory and Algebraic
Combinatorics.

			    The Conference

Each day will be devoted to one of the major areas of computational algebra 
with invited lectures, contributed talks and workshop sessions on the
corresponding MAGMA features. In each area, leading researchers have been 
invited to survey the key algorithms and discuss the most recent advances. 
Particular stress will be placed on the growing interactions between the 
various branches of Computational Algebra. Short submitted talks will provide 
an opportunity to describe recent progress on specific problems. The MAGMA 
workshop sessions will be designed to provide insight into the practical
implementation of the ideas covered by the talks and on how to use the 
available features. Ample opportunities will be provided for participants to 
gain hands-on experience with the system.

Intending contributors should forward an extended abstract to arrive before
1 June, 1993. If significantly more contributions are offered than can be 
fitted into the time-slots available, poster sessions may be organized.

It is planned to publish a proceedings for the Conference.

We have been fortunate to obtain excellent on-site accommodation for eighty
participants, at the very low price of 20 pounds a night.  Additional
places are available further away from the College.  We will allocate places
on a first come first served basis. (A queue rather than a stack.)
Planning the Conference will be greatly facilitated if applications are
received as soon as possible.

The registration fee for the Conference is 50 pounds sterling.  Please send 
your payment for this amount to the address below.  We regret that we will
have to raise the registration fee to 60 pounds sterling from June 1st
to cover the deposit for accommodation.  The price of 20 pounds per
night for College accommodation includes breakfast.  The rooms are
single.  Members of the Conference may book a second room, on the
payment of an extra 10 pounds registration fee.  If you wish for any
help in booking hotel rooms we will make the necessary arrangements.
It is reasonable to expect a charge of at least 50 pounds a night
for a double room.  There are no hotels close to the College.  Your
registration fee will be an adequate deposit on the accommodation;
please be prepared to pay the cost of your accommodation on arrival.
It is hoped that the registration fee will include a copy of the
Proceedings, which we intend to publish either as Queen Mary and
Westfield College Mathematical Notes, or with a commercial publisher.
If we choose a commercial publisher it is more likely that we will have
to make a charge.

We do not expect to be able to subsidise the Conference dinner.  This
may cost about fifteen pounds sterling plus wine.
We have not heard the result of all our grant applications; the
financial details should be clearer when we issue the third
announcement.

We may be able to offer support from the Royal Society for conference
members from the ex-Soviet Union.  Please inform us at once of any
applications under this heading.

We are grateful to the London Mathematical Society for a generous
grant.

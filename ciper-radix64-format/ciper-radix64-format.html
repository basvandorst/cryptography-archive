<H2>Sending ciphertext through E-mail channels: Radix-64
  format</H2>
<P>Many electronic mail systems only allow messages made of ASCII text,
not the 8-bit raw binary data that ciphertext is made of.  To get
around this problem, PGP supports ASCII radix-64 format for
ciphertext messages, similar to the Internet Privacy-Enhanced Mail
(PEM) format, as well as the Internet MIME format.  This special
format represents binary data by using only printable ASCII
characters, so it is useful for transmitting binary encrypted data
through 7-bit channels or for sending binary encrypted data as normal
E-mail text.  This format acts as a form of <I>transport armor</I>,
protecting it against corruption as it travels through intersystem
gateways on Internet.  PGP also appends a CRC to detect transmission
errors.
<P>Radix-64 format converts the plaintext by expanding groups of 3
binary 8-bit bytes into 4 printable ASCII characters, so the file
grows by about 33consider that the file probably was compressed more than that by PGP
before it was encrypted.
<P>To produce a ciphertext file in ASCII radix-64 format, just add the
<KBD>a</KBD> option when encrypting or signing a message, like so:
<PRE>
    pgp -esa message.txt her_userid
</PRE>
This example produces a ciphertext file called <VAR>message.asc</VAR> that
contains data in a MIME-like ASCII radix-64 format.  This file can be
easily uploaded into a text editor through 7-bit channels for
transmission as normal E-mail on Internet or any other E-mail
network.
<P>Decrypting the radix-64 transport-armored message is no different than
a normal decrypt.  For example:
<PRE>
    pgp message
</PRE>
PGP automatically looks for the ASCII file <VAR>message.asc</VAR> before
it looks for the binary file <VAR>message.pgp</VAR>.  It recognizes that
the file is in radix-64 format and converts it back to binary before
processing as it normally does, producing as a by-product a
<VAR>.pgp</VAR> ciphertext file in binary form.  The final output file is
in normal plaintext form, just as it was in the original file
<I>message.txt</I>.
<P>Most Internet E-mail facilities prohibit sending messages that are
more than 50000 or 65000 bytes long.  Longer messages must be broken
into smaller chunks that can be mailed separately.  If your encrypted
message is very large, and you requested radix-64 format, PGP
automatically breaks it up into chunks that are each small enough to
send via E-mail.  The chunks are put into files named with extensions
<VAR>.as1</VAR>, <VAR>.as2</VAR>, <VAR>.as3</VAR>, etc.  The recipient must
concatenate these separate files back together in their proper order
into one big file before decrypting it.  While decrypting, PGP ignores
any extraneous text in mail headers that are not enclosed in the
radix-64 message blocks.
<P>If you want to send a public key to someone else in radix-64 format,
just add the <KBD>-a</KBD> option while extracting the key from your
keyring.
<P>If you forgot to use the <KBD>-a</KBD> option when you made a ciphertext
file or extracted a key, you may still directly convert the binary
file into radix-64 format by simply using the <KBD>-a</KBD> option alone, without
any encryption specified.  PGP converts it to a <VAR>.asc</VAR> file.
<P>If you sign a plaintext file without encrypting it, PGP will normally
compress it after signing it, rendering it unreadable to the casual
human observer.  This is a suitable way of storing signed files in
archival applications.  But if you want to send the signed message as
E-mail, and the the original plaintext message is in text (not binary)
form, there is a way to send it through an E-mail channel in such a
way that the plaintext does not get compressed, and the ASCII armor is
applied only to the binary signature certificate, but not to the
plaintext message.  This makes it possible for the recipient to read
the signed message with human eyes, without the aid of
PGP.  Of course, PGP is still needed to actually check the
signature.  For further information on this feature, see the
explanation of the CLEARSIG parameter in the section <A HREF="../pgpdoc2/setting-conf-par.html">"Setting
  Configuration Parameters"</A> in the
Special Topics volume.
<P>Sometimes you may want to send a binary data file through an E-mail
channel without encrypting or signing it with PGP.  Some
people use the Unix uuencode utility for that purpose.  PGP can also
be used for that purpose, by simply using the <KBD>-a</KBD> option alone,
and it does a better job than the uuencode utility.  For further
details, see the section on <A HREF="../pgpdoc2/pgp-better-uuencode.html">"Using PGP as a Better Uuencode"</A> in the
Special Topics volume.

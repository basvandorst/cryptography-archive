# Premail configuration file
#
# This is the default .premailrc for premail v. 0.20

#
# To change a setting, remove the # before the $config, and edit the
# value after the = sign. For example, to set pgppath to
# ~/remailerkeys, change the line
#    # $config{"pgppath"} = "~/.pgp"
# to
#    $config{"pgppath"} = "~/remailerkeys"

# encrypt: Set this to "yes" if you want to use PGP encryption.
#
# $config{"encrypt"} = "";

# pgp: this is the filename where your copy of PGP resides.
#
# $config{"pgp"} = "pgp";

# oldpgp: this is where a version of PGP, other than MIT PGP 2.6,
# resides. If you are running, say PGP 2.3a or 2.6ui, then set both
# pgp and oldpgp to the same file. If you are running MIT PGP 2.6, set
# pgp, but leave oldpgp not set.
#
# config{"oldpgp"} = "";

# pgppath: This is the directory where the remailer keys are stored.
# Note: at the moment, premail will _not_ automatically put these keys
# here. To do so, run:
#    premail -getkeys
#
# $config{"pgppath"} = "~/.pgp";

# remailers: where to store the list of remailers. This is usually
# ~/.remailers . If you don't want to use the auto-finger capability
# (for example, if your machine is not on the net, or doesn't support
# finger), then you should get the file (it's posted weekly to
# alt.privacy.anon-server) and store it there.
#
# $config{"remailers"} = "~/.remailers";

# getmailers: This is the command used to get the list of remailers.
# If you don't want this, disable it by setting it to "".
#
# $config{"getmailers"} = "finger remailer-list@kiwi.cs.berkeley.edu";

# signuser: Set this to your PGP key user id if you want premail to
# sign your PGP-encrypted  messages. If you also set signpass, it will
# do it automatically, without asking you for a passphrase. If you set
# signuser but not signpass, then you can only use premail in contexts
# where you are running it directly from a terminal.
#
# $config{"signuser"} = "";

# signpass: Set this to your PGP key's passphrase if you are using
# signuser and want the signing to happen automatically. BE CAREFUL
# using this feature. Make sure that this file (.premailrc) is
# readable only by you. If someone else reads this file, then they
# know your passphrase, and your PGP key is compromised. Otherwise,
# enjoy the convenience.
#
# $config{"signpass"} = "";

# defaultpath: default path for routing mail messages. If most or all
# of your mail will go through the remailers, then this is a good one
# to set. It can be either a standard remailer path (such as
# kaiwan;wien;portal), or a number indicating how many hops. If you
# set this and want to send mail that is _not_ sent through the
# remailers, include the line 
#    Path: ;
# in your header.
#
# $config{"defaultpath"} = "";

# penetpass: If you want to send mail through penet, it is a good idea
# to use the penet's password feature. First, send mail to
# password@anon.penet.fi, with a one-line message containing the
# password. Then, set the value here. The same caution as pgppass
# applies here as well. Note: mail through penet is only guaranteed to
# work if it is the first remailer in the path.
#
# config{"penetpass"} = "";

# anon-from: This automatically adds a "Reply-To:" field to all
# anonymous outgoing mail. You can override it by providing your own
# "Anon-From:", or inserting a "No-Reply:" line in the header. If you
# want to remain anonymous, set this to a penet or vox-style alias.
#
# $config{"anon-from"} = "";

# sendmail: this is where the system's real sendmail is kept. It is
# almost always /usr/lib/sendmail, but if not, set it here. If you're
# installing premail as /usr/lib/sendmail, then it's a better idea to
# set it within the premail file itself, so that it doesn't depend on
# reading this ~/.premailrc file.
#
# $config{"sendmail"} = "/usr/lib/sendmail";

# storefile: where to store outgoing mail instead of using sendmail to
# send it directly. This is useful if your machine is usually not
# connected to the net when you use premail. You can send your mail
# later by just running csh on it (i.e. "csh storefile"). Delete the
# file after it is sent, so that you don't send the same mail more
# than once. This is also useful for composing mail on a different
# machine than sending it, in which case you would transfer the file.
#
# $config{"storefile"} = "";

# logfile: where to keep a log of mail sent through premail. A log can
# be very useful in tracking down problems, especially since it can
# help identify bounced mail.
#
# $config{"logfile"} = "";

# debug: you can set debug options here, although it is usually better
# to do so from the command line (i.e. sendmail +debug=y -t).
#
# $config{"debug"} = "";

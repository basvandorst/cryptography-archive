This diskette contains a demo version of News for Win32
systems (Windows NT and Chicago). It is currently only tested
under Windows NT on machines with Digital Alpha AXP and
Intel processors. It will not run under Win32s (uses Win32
Registery API).

This release may be freely copied and distributed world-wide.
If you do reproduce or distribute this material, all the files
included on this disk must be reproduced in their original form.

INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION

There is no installation procedure for this software. Simply
execute the .EXE file which matches your processor architecture.

By default, News will keep all the configuration information in
the Registery database. If you want to use an external  .newsrc
file to store information about your subscribed newsgroups, select
"Options->General" and change the settings. Make sure to make a
backup copy of your existing .newsrc file before doing this!

Before posting articles, you need to set up templates for
creating new articles. Select "Options->New Articles" and
enter your templates.

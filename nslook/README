To build nslook, edit the Makefile and type "make". 

BSD 4.3:
-lresolv not required (and not available).

Interactive 386/ix 2.0.2: 
Link -linet. 
When I mistyped an address and gave 188.1..1.1, gethostbyname()
returned NULL and h_errno was zero. Strange.

SunOS 4.1.1: 
Link -lresolv.
Since libresolv.a has to be linked with the shared library, it did
only work for me with gcc if I forced gcc to use Sun's ld.

DECstation, Ultrix 4.0:
Link -lresolv.

HP-UX 7.0:
No additional libraries required.

Nixdorf TARGON 31 TOS 4.0.12:
No additional libraries, but looks only in /etc/hosts.

Silicon Graphics IRIX System V.3:
No additional libraries.


nslook is a simple form of nslookup. It only gives you what you want
to see: The Internet address of a host, or the host's name for a given
Internet address.

Usage: nslook [-l] [-n] hostname
       nslook [-l] [-a] IP-address
-a forces interpretation of the argument as an address; -n forces
interpretation of it as a hostname.  Otherwise, it is converted to
a hostname if it looks like an address, and to an address if not.
-l and -v both mean "verbose output."

Some examples of use:

$ nslook ucbvax.berkeley.edu
128.32.133.1
$ nslook -l ucbvax.berkeley.edu
Official name: ucbvax.berkeley.edu
Address:       128.32.133.1
$ nslook 128.32.133.1
ucbvax.Berkeley.EDU
$ nslook -l 128.32.133.1
Official name: ucbvax.Berkeley.EDU
Address:       128.32.133.1
$ nslook -l ftp.informatik.uni-dortmund.de
Official name: walhalla.informatik.uni-dortmund.de
Alias:         ftp.informatik.uni-dortmund.de
Address:       129.217.64.63

This directory contains auxiliary files needed to build Q.
All the files on the Q-misc.tar.Z distribuation are available
from the FSF; but they are packaged here for your convenience.

You should make sure Q (from Q.tar.Z) is a subdirectory of Qroot:
	$ ls
	Makefile.in     config          configure.in    include
	Q               config.sub      glob            move-if-change
	README          configure       gmp             readline

Then you can:
	configure sun4
(or decstation or news or linux;  others systems are not yet supported
for Q, but should be straightforward to port).

To build with (extremely preliminary) InterViews support, instead:
	configure --with-iv

You should already have built and installed g++ (version 2.2.2 or
newer is recommended) and libg++ (version 2.2 or newer is recommended).

Then just:
	make

For more information about Q itself, look in ./Q/README.

This is a string packages that uses a tree-based representation.
See gc.h for a description of the functions provided.  Ec.h describes
"extensible cords", which are essentially output streams that write
to a cord.  These allow for efficient construction of cords without
requiring a bound on the size of a cord.

de.c is a very dumb text editor that illustrates the use of cords.
It maintains a list of file versions.  Each version is simply a
cord representing the file contents.  Nonetheless, standard
editing operations are efficient, even on very large files.
(Its 3 line "user manual" can be obtained by invoking it without
arguments.  Note that ^R^N and ^R^P move the cursor by
about half a screen.  It does not understand tabs, which will show
up as highlighred "I"s.  Use the UNIX "expand" program first.)
To build the editor, type "make cord/de" in the gc directory.

This package assumes an ANSI C compiler such as gcc.  It will
not compile with an old-style K&R compiler.

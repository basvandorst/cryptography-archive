Makefile bug seems to make everything build twice.  Spurious dep?

Make sure manual docs all mpf functions, and not lots of spurious functions.

Make _ui functions have type int, not long.

The build process need further work.  It is now halfway between using
configure and figuring out things by executing tests during the build.

mp_bases.o should be in gmp (and libmpn.a).

mpz_inp_str should handle 0x...  Input routines should skip leading
white space?

Merge Ken's GCD code.  A mpz_gcd_ui would also be useful.

Add tests to all subdirs, and add a check target for `make'.

No mpq input routines should normalize.  A new mpq_normalize routine
should handle that, and it has to be called explicitly by the user.

Users' request: mpq_set_zz (mpq, mpz_1, mpz_2).

Document new stuff, including the mpn layer.  In particular, document
incompatibilities (like mpq normalization, mpn_lshift and mpn_rshift,
and all other mpn functions' return values.)

Make BSD compat functions work.  mout should group in 10-digit groups.

Use TMP_ALLOC and TMP_ALLOC_CLEANUP instead of alloca.

Install the bug fixes made betwee 1.2 and the current 1.X sources.

Check out .Mail/inbox and .Mail/MP for more things.

Prepend _ to function names, make cross-calls use these names.  Make
stub functions for each user-callable function, just passing on the _
function.

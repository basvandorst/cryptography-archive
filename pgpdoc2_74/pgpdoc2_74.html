<H2>Reporting PGP bugs</H2>
<P>Bugs in PGP should be reported via E-mail to MIT, the official
distribution site of PGP.  The E-mail address for bug reports is
pgp-bugs@mit.edu.  MIT will forward a copy of your bug report to me. 
When you report bugs, be sure to specify what machine and operating
system you are using and what version of PGP you have, and provide
enough detail to reproduce the problem.  It would also be a good idea
to find out if you have the latest version of PGP, in case the bug
has already been fixed.  Also, it's a good idea to make sure it
really is a bug before you report it.  RTFM.

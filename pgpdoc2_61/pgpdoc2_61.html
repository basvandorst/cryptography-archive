<H2>Protecting against bogus timestamps</H2>
<P>A somewhat obscure vulnerability of PGP involves dishonest users
creating bogus timestamps on their own public key certificates and
signatures.  You can skip over this section if you are a casual user
and aren't deeply into obscure public key protocols.
<P>There's nothing to stop a dishonest user from altering the date and
time setting of his own system's clock, and generating his own public
key certificates and signatures that appear to have been created at a
different time.  He can make it appear that he signed something
earlier or later than he actually did, or that his public/secret key
pair was created earlier or later.  This may have some legal or
financial benefit to him, for example by creating some kind of 
loophole that might allow him to repudiate a signature.
<P>I think this problem of falsified timestamps in digital signatures is
no worse than it is already in handwritten signatures.  Anyone may
write a date next to their handwritten signature on a contract with
any date they choose, yet no one seems to be alarmed over this state
of affairs.  In some cases, an "incorrect" date on a handwritten
signature might not be associated with actual fraud.  The timestamp
might be when the signator asserts that he signed a document, or
maybe when he wants the signature to go into effect.
<P>In situations where it is critical that a signature be trusted to
have the actual correct date, people can simply use notaries to
witness and date a handwritten signature.  The analog to this in
digital signatures is to get a trusted third party to sign a
signature certificate, applying a trusted timestamp.  No exotic or
overly formal protocols are needed for this.  Witnessed signatures
have long been recognized as a legitimate way of determining when a
document was signed.
<P>A trustworthy Certifying Authority or notary could create notarized
signatures with a trustworthy timestamp.  This would not necessarily
require a centralized authority.  Perhaps any trusted introducer or
disinterested party could serve this function, the same way real
notary publics do now.  When a notary signs other people's
signatures, it creates a signature certificate of a signature
certificate.  This would serve as a witness to the signature the same
way real notaries now witness handwritten signatures.  The notary
could enter the detached signature certificate (without the actual
whole document that was signed) into a special log controlled by the
notary.  Anyone can read this log.  The notary's signature would have
a trusted timestamp, which might have greater credibility or more
legal significance than the timestamp in the original signature.
<P>There is a good treatment of this topic in Denning's 1983 article in
IEEE Computer (see references).  Future enhancements to PGP might
have features to easily manage notarized signatures of signatures,
with trusted timestamps.

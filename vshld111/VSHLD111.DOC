VSHIELD Version 5.56V111                                  Page 2


          SYNOPSIS

               VSHIELD is a virus prevention program for IBM PC and 
          compatibles.  VSHIELD prevents viruses from infecting your
          system.  When VSHIELD first loads it will search memory, the
          master boot record (partition table), boot sector, system
          files, and itself for known computer viruses before going into
          memory as a Terminate-and-Stay-Resident (TSR) program.

               VSHIELD checks for viruses by scanning programs as they
          are run for virus signatures and/or validation codes added by
          VIRUSCAN.  Infected programs are prevented from running and a
          a warning message is displayed by VSHIELD.  VSHIELD also stops
          soft boots from disks infected by boot-sector viruses.

               VSHIELD optionally checks validation codes added by SCAN
          to check if a file has been altered or modified.  This can be
          used to detect unknown (new) viruses.

               VSHIELD optionally check for viruses as files are copied
          or accessed.

               VSHIELD optionally provides access control functions to
          reduce the risk of virus infection from unauthorized software.

               Two discrete programs are available.  The first,
          VSHIELD.EXE, checks for viruses using virus signatures and
          validation codes added by SCAN.  The second, VSHIELD1.EXE,
          only checks validation codes added by SCAN.  Both programs
          monitor all program loads from all disks unless otherwise
          specified.

               The VSHINST program installs an icon for VSHIELD under
          Windows 3.x.  This icon can be used to toggle VSHIELD on and
          off.

               The VSHWIN program allows VSHIELD to display messages
          while Windows 3.x is running.

               The CHKSHLD program checks for VSHIELD in memory for use
          in network login scripts.

               VSHIELD will run on any PC with 256Kb and DOS 2.10 or
          above.  VSHIELD1 uses 6Kb of memory.  VSHIELD uses 46Kb of
          conventional memory if loaded normally, 25Kb of conventional
          memory if EMS is present, 5Kb of conventional memory if
          swapped-to-disk, and 1.5Kb of conventional memory if loaded
          into upper memory.

          AUTHENTICITY

               VSHIELD is packaged with VALIDATE, a program to ensure
          the integrity of the executable program files.  The
          VALIDATE.DOC file describes how to use VALIDATE.

               The validation results for the VSHIELD 5.56V111
          should be:

          FILENAME:     SIZE:      DATE         CHECK METHOD:

          CHKSHLD.EXE   S:8,171    D:08-17-93   M1: 7B3C  M2: 1B48
          VALIDATE.COM  S:12,197   D:03-24-92   M1: D5BB  M2: 166F
          VSHIELD.EXE   S:52,701   D:01-14-94   M1: 7DD2  M2: 09A6
          VSHIELD1.EXE  S:18,833   D:06-24-93   M1: F414  M2: 13F5
          VSHINST.EXE   S:9,780    D:08-11-93   M1: 44A6  M2: 1D0F
          VSHWIN.EXE    S:15,927   D:08-17-93   M1: 874E  M2: 0CB1

          If your copy of VSHIELD differs, it may have options stored to
          it with the /SAVE switch or been damaged by a virus.  Run
          VSHIELD with just the /SAVE switch to remove any stored options
          and then re-run VALIDATE.  Always obtain VSHIELD from a trusted
          source such as the McAfee BBS, CompuServe, or your local McAfee
          Agent. The latest version of VSHIELD and validation codes can
          always be found on our BBS at +1 (408) 988-4004.


          PKZIP AUTHENTICATION VERIFICATION


               All of McAfee Associates' programs are archived with
          Version 2.04g of PKWare's PKZIP Authentic File Verification.
          When unzipped with Version 1.10 of PKWare's PKUNZIP program,
          an "-AV" will be displayed after each file is unzipped and an
          "Authentic files Verified! # FZW807  McAFEE ASSOCIATES" will
          appear once all files are unzipped.

          NOTE:  If you do not receive the Authentic File Verification
                 messages, you may be using a different version of
                 PKUNZIP, such as V1.10 or V1.93A.  Use PKUNZIP Version
                 2.04g to unzip files if you wish to have Authenticity
                 Verification displayed as files are unzipped.

          WHAT'S NEW

          Version 111 of VSHIELD adds detection of viruses added
          in Version 111 of VIRUSCAN.


          WHAT'S RECENT

               Two new options have been added in Version 108 of
          VSHIELD, the /BOOT and /NOFLOPPY options.  The first
          switch, /BOOT, tells VSHIELD to check the boot sector
          of floppy disks whenever a diskette is accessed.  The
          second, /NOFLOPPY, disables the boot sector checking of
          floppy disks, and should only be used when VSHIELD is
          run with the /ACCESS switch in an OS/2 Virtual DOS Machine
          (VDM) session to prevent a problem displaying directories.

               Starting with Version 107 of VSHIELD, support for the
          Lotus-Intel-Microsoft Expanded Memory Specification (LIM-EMS)
          version 3.2 has been added.  If expanded memory is
          present, VSHIELD will automatically make use of it to
          store data in.  This will reduce the amount of conventional
          memory or upper memory used to 25Kb, with the remainder of
          the program going into EMS.  This can be disabled by running
          VSHIELD with the /NOEMS option.

               A new program, VSHINST, has been created.  This
          program allows the user to selectively toggle VSHIELD on
          and off in a Windows environment.

               The /LOCK switch now displays messages under Windows.

          For more information on viruses added in this release,
          please refer to the VIRUSCAN documentation, the accompanying
          VIRLIST.TXT file, or Patricia Hoffman's Hypertext VSUM.

















VSHIELD Version 5.56V111                                  Page 5


          OVERVIEW

               VSHIELD is a memory-resident program that prevents virus
          infection.  VSHIELD does this by checking programs as they are
          loaded by the computer.  VSHIELD will not allow a file to run if
          a virus is found, a program does not match its validation code,
          or a file is not on the /CERTIFY list--this prevents the virus
          from entering your system.  VSHIELD also checks for boot
          sector viruses during reboots and optionally checks for viruses
          during copy operations or whenever a disk is accessed.

               When VSHIELD is run from the AUTOEXEC.BAT, it is installed
          each time the system is turned on or rebooted.  VSHIELD checks
          memory, the partition table, boot sector, system files, and
          itself for viruses prior to installation as a Terminate-and-
          Stay-Resident (TSR) program.  It monitors all program loads
          for viruses.

               When a system is booted from an infected disk, VSHIELD will
          detect the virus the next time VSHIELD runs since VSHIELD must
          be in memory to detect the virus.

          VSHIELD has four user-selectable levels of protection:

          -    Level I protection, provided by VSHIELD1, checks validation
               codes added by VIRUSCAN's /AV or /AG switches [see
               VIRUSCAN's documentation for more information].  Programs
               failing the validation check will not be allowed to run.
               VSHIELD1 also checks the partition table and boot sector
               validation codes, if present.  Level I provides minimal
               protection only and is not recommended for normal use,
               VSHIELD is recommended instead.

          -    Level II protection, provided by VSHIELD, checks programs
               for virus signatures, the pattern of code unique to each
               virus. If a virus is found, VSHIELD will not allow the
               program to run.  VSHIELD will also prevent reboots from
               disks infected with a boot sector viruses.

          -    Level III protection, provided by VSHIELD /CF {filename} or
               /CV, incorporates both Level I and Level II protection.

          -    Level IV protection, provided by VSHIELD /CERTIFY,
               incorporates Level III protection with access control,
               specifying which programs can be run.







VSHIELD Version 5.56V111                                  Page 6


          Each level of protection has its advantages and disadvantages. 

               VSHIELD1 (Level I) requires the least system overhead,
          using 6Kb of memory.  It provides only minimal protection.

               VSHIELD (Levels 2-4) requires as much as 46Kb of
          conventional memory, this can be reduced to 25Kb by loading
          VSHIELD into EMS, or 1.5Kb by loading into upper memory.

               VSHIELD1 will add an average of one second to each program
          load.

               VSHIELD adds an average of one second to program loads and
          six seconds to reboots.  Using the /SWAP option adds an
          additional second since VSHIELD must re-load itself from disk
          prior to checking another file.

               VSHIELD will not degrade the performance of the system once
          programs have been loaded, except for programs which load other
          programs when the /ACCESS or /COPY options are being used.

          NOTE:  VSHIELD and VSHIELD1 should not be used simultaneously.  
                 Either one or the other should be used, but not both.

               CHKSHLD is run to see if VSHIELD is in memory.  CHKSHLD can
          look for the presence of any version of VSHIELD, or a specific
          version (a feature that can be used to update a workstation from
          its file server).

          OPERATION and OPTIONS


          IMPORTANT NOTE:  CREATE A BACKUP DISK BY COPYING VSHIELD TO A
                           BLANK FLOPPY AND WRITE-PROTECT IT 

               To provide optimal protection against viruses VSHIELD (or
          VSHIELD1) should normally be placed at the end of the
          AUTOEXEC.BAT.  However, if a menu program is run from the
          AUTOEXEC.BAT, VSHIELD should be loaded before it.  Popular
          menu programs include MS-DOS's DOSSHELL, etc.

               Loading disk cache or network driver programs after
          VSHIELD may disable it.  To prevent this from happening, re-run
          VSHIELD with the /RECONNECT switch.

               CHKSHLD should be run from the network login script.  An
          ERRORLEVEL is returned if VSHIELD is in memory.  This can be
          used for creating scripts to check and update VSHIELD.


          A NOTE ON VSHIELD'S SWITCHES

               VSHIELD is designed to provide a high degree of protection
          even when none of the switches below are used.  Placing VSHIELD
          in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file with no options provides sufficient
          protection for virtually all environments.  If available memory
          is at a premium, the /LH (Load High) or /SWAP (Swap-to-Disk)
          options can be used to minimize memory usage.

               Other options should be used only if required due to non-
          standard systems or special security needs.  VSHIELD provides
          many options for flexibility in meeting the needs of corporate,
          network, and secure environments but trade-offs in system
          overhead and user restrictions must be carefully evaluated.

          EMS USAGE

               VSHIELD offers support for the Lotus-Intel-Microsoft
          Expanded Memory Specification (LIM-EMS) version 3.2.  If
          expanded memory is present, VSHIELD will automatically make
          use of it to store data in.  This will reduce the amount of
          conventional memory or upper memory used to 25Kb, with the
          remainder of the program going into EMS.  EMS usage can be
          disabled by running VSHIELD with the /NOEMS switch.  The
          /SWAP and /CF {filename} cannot be used with EMS memory.

               The /ACCESS option tells VSHIELD to check for viruses
          whenever a program is opened, such as during DOS operations
          (ATTRIB, COPY, DIR, REN, and so forth) and file manipulation
          by menu, shell, and utility programs.  This option is
          intended for high risk environments such as open-use computer
          labs, help desks, and software developers.  It will slow down
          any program file accesses by approximately 15-20%, as such it
          is not recommended for use with the /CF, /CV, or /CG options
          for performance reasons.  This option will not work with the
          /BOOT, /COPY, or /SWAP options.

          NOTE:  /ACCESS must be used in place of /COPY for checking
                 COPY operations with 4DOS or the Windows File Manager.

               The /BOOT option tells VSHIELD to check the boot sector
          of floppy disks whenever they are accessed.  This options does
          not work from within Windows File Manager.  For virus checking
          within Windows, use the /ACCESS switch instead.  This switch
          does not work with the /ACCESS, /COPY, or /SWAP options.

               The /CERTIFY option prevents files without validation codes
          added by VIRUSCAN from being run.  For this option to work, the
          /CF {filename}, /CG, or /CV switches must be used.  This option
          is primarily for system administrators to prevent users from
          running programs that could introduce a virus.  An exception list
          of "trusted" files can be created to allow use of programs that do
          not work correctly with validation codes  attached.  For
          instructions on creating an exception list, refer to Appendix A.

          NOTE:  Running /CERTIFY without an exception list or validation
                 codes will prevent all programs except for DOS internal
                 commands from running.

              The /CF option checks recovery and validation data stored
          by VIRUSCAN's /AF option.  If a file or system area has changed,
          VSHIELD will report that a viral infection may have occurred.  The
          syntax is /CF {filename}, where {filename} is the name of the
          recovery and validation data file created by VIRUSCAN.  The /CF
          switch cannot be used with EMS memory and must be used with the
          /NOEMS switch.

               The /CG option checks recovery and validation data stored
          by VIRUSCAN's /AG option.  If a file or system area has changed,
          VSHIELD will report that a viral infection may have occurred.

               The /CHKHI option checks memory above 640Kb on 286/386/486
          systems for viruses.  This covers the Upper Memory Area from
          640 - 1024K, and the High Memory Area from 1024 - 1088K.  This
          option cannot be used with the /NOMEM option.



VSHIELD Version 5.56V111                                  Page 10


               The /CONTACT option is used to display a custom message
          when a virus is found.  The message can be up to 50 characters
          long and contain any character except for a backslash "\".
          Messages starting with a hyphen "-" or slash "/" must be placed
          into quotation marks.

               The /COPY option checks files for viruses during COPY
          operations and checks the floppy drives for boot sector viruses
          during COPY and DIR operations.  The /COPY option does not work
          with 4DOS or the Windows File Manager; to check COPY operations
          done by them use the /ACCESS option instead.  This option
          cannot be used with the /ACCESS, /BOOT, or /SWAP options.

               The /CV option checks validation codes added by SCAN to
          .COM and .EXE files.  If a file has changed it will no longer
          match its validation code and VSHIELD will report the file has
          been modified and a viral infection may have occurred.  For
          instructions on adding validation codes, refer to VIRUSCAN's
          documentation. 

               The /F option is required for using /SWAP under DOS 2.0.
          The /F option tells VSHIELD what path to swap from.  The
          complete path must be specified after the /F.

               The /IGNORE option tells VSHIELD to ignore program loads
          from specified drives.  Ignored drives will NOT be checked for
          viruses.  Up to 26 drives may be ignored.  /IGNORE is designed
          for use with LAN's that have virus protection and is not
          recommended for PC's or networks with no anti-viral software.

               The /LH option loads VSHIELD into upper memory.  For /LH to
          work, an expanded memory manager such as Microsoft's EMM386,
          Quarterdeck's QEMM, Helix' NetRoom, or Qualitas' 386^MAX should
          be used.  This option cannot be used with /SWAP.

               The /LOCK option halts the system if a virus is found so
          that infection cannot occur.  It is recommend that the /CONTACT
          switch be used to tell the user what to do when the system
          halts.

               The /M option checks base memory for all known memory-
          resident viruses before VSHIELD installs in memory.  By default,
          VSHIELD only checks memory for critical (stealth) viruses.  If a
          critical virus is found during installation, VSHIELD will stop
          and advise the user to turn off the PC, boot from a clean
          (virus-free) DOS system disk and scan the system for viruses.
          For a listing of critical viruses, please refer to the VIRUSCAN
          documentation.  This option cannot be used with the /NOMEM
          option.



VSHIELD Version 5.56V111                                  Page 11


               The /NB option tells VSHIELD to skip the partition table
          and boot sector check during installation and reboots.  This
          option can be used to load VSHIELD from a network server.

               The /NI6510 option prevents a conflict between VSHIELD
          Racal-Datacomm NI6510 network interface cards: when a PC was
          rebooted, a stream of corrupted packets would be sent across the
          network.  The problem and solution is specific the NI6510 and
          does not apply to any other product.

               The /NOBREAK option prevents Ctrl-C and Ctrl-Brk from
          stopping VSHIELD during the installation process.

               The /NOCONT option prevents the user from proceeding after
          the "Proceed Anyway? Y/N" message when running non-certified
          programs.

               The /NODISK option disables the boot sector and partition
          table check during installation.  This option can be used to
          load VSHIELD from a network server.

               The /NOFLOPPY option disables checking the boot sector
          of floppy disks from the A: and B: drives.

               The /NOEMS option prevents VSHIELD from using expanded
          memory.  It must be used with the /CF and /SWAP switches.

               The /NOMEM option skips the memory check for viruses during
          installation.  It should only be used when a PC is known to be
          virus-free.  This option cannot be used with the /CHKHI or /M
          options.

               The /NOREMOVE option prevents VSHIELD from being unloaded
          with the /REMOVE option.  This option cannot be used with the
          /REMOVE option.

               The /ONLY option tells VSHIELD to check program loads only
          from the specified drives.  All other drives will be ignored.
          This option cannot be used with the /IGNORE option.

               The /RECONNECT option is used to restore VSHIELD's link
          into DOS after another program has disabled it, such as a
          network driver or disk cache.  This eliminates the need to
          continually load and unload VSHIELD when logging on to a
          network.

               The /REMOVE option unloads VSHIELD from memory.  If other
          memory resident programs are loaded after VSHIELD, then VSHIELD
          cannot be unloaded.  This option can be disabled by installing
          VSHIELD with the /NOREMOVE option.


VSHIELD Version 5.56V111                                  Page 12


               The /SAVE option is used to store VSHIELD options for
          subsequent executions of VSHIELD.  Options are stored by
          modifying the VSHIELD.EXE executable file.  For example:

               VSHIELD /LH /M /NOBREAK /SAVE

          will set the VSHIELD defaults to /LH, /M, and /NOBREAK.  If
          VSHIELD is run with just the /SAVE switch, then all options are
          removed and VSHIELD executes with its original default settings.

               The /SWAP option tells VSHIELD to install a small (3Kb)
          kernel in memory and load itself on demand.  If a path is
          specified after /SWAP, VSHIELD will swap from that path instead
          of the path from which it is being executed.  The /SWAP option
          cannot be used with the /COPY or /ACCESS options.  The /NOEMS
          switch must be used if /SWAP is used.

          NOTE:  The /SWAP parameter should only be used if limited
                 amounts of memory are available for programs.  It is
                 recommended that VSHIELD be used without the /SWAP
                 option whenever memory permits for performance reasons.

               The /WINDOWS option allows VSHIELD to display messages
          under Windows 3.X in a Windows dialogue box.  It does this by
          copying VSHWIN.EXE file into the Windows directory and adding
          it to the WIN.INI file to run when Windows is started.  By
          default, VSHIELD searches for a directory named \WINDOWS on
          the currently-logged drive.  If Windows is not on the current
          drive, then a {pathname} may be specified telling VSHIELD where
          to install VSHWIN.EXE (and WIN.INI).

          NOTE:  This option now installs the Windows display program
                 and needs to be run once.

          NOTE:  For the VSHWIN program to display messages under
                 Windows, VSHIELD must be run with the /ACCESS switch.


          ERROR LEVELS 

                After VSHIELD has installed itself in memory, it will set
          the DOS ERRORLEVEL.  ERRORLEVEL's are used in batch files to
          pass along the results of a programs's actions.  The
          ERRORLEVEL's returned by VSHIELD are:

               ERRORLEVEL ณ DESCRIPTION
               อออออออออออุอออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
                   0      ณ No viruses found
                   1      ณ One or more viruses found
                   2      ณ Abnormal termination (program error)


VSHIELD Version 5.56V111                                  Page 13


          VSHIELD1


               Valid options for VSHIELD1 are listed below:

          VSHIELD1 /NB /REMOVE

          Options are:

                    /NB - Disable boot sector checking during install
                          and reboot.
                /REMOVE - Unload VSHIELD1 from memory


               The /NB option tells VSHIELD1 to skip the partition table
          and boot sector check during installation and reboots.

               The /REMOVE option unloads VSHIELD1 from memory.  If other
          memory resident programs are loaded after VSHIELD1, then
          VSHIELD1 cannot be unloaded.


          VSHINST

               VSHINST allows VSHIELD to display a status icon on
          the Windows Desktop which can be used to toggle VSHIELD on
          and off.  To run VSHINST, choose the Run command from the
          Windows File Manager and enter the full path name of VSHINST.

               The VSHINST program creates a Group named MCAFEE in
          the Windows directory and then adds an icon for VSHIELD to
          the group.

               For VSHINST to be installed and work correctly the
          Windows Program Manager must be the default shell; VSHWIN
          has been installed with the VSHIELD /WINDOWS; and Windows
          must be running in protected mode.















VSHIELD Version 5.56V111                                  Page 14


               Valid options for CHKSHLD are listed below:

          CHKSHLD /DEBUG /Q /V "xxxxx" /? /H /HELP

          Options are:

                  /DEBUG - Display version and ERRORLEVEL
                      /Q - Quiet mode (no messages displayed)
              /V "xxxxx" - Check for version "xxxxx" of VSHIELD in memory
             /? /H /HELP - Display help screen

               The /DEBUG option displays the version of VSHIELD resident
          in memory and the DOS ERRORLEVEL on the screen.

               The /Q option stops CHKSHLD from displaying any messages.

               The /V option tells CHKSHLD to look for a specific version
          of VSHIELD in memory.  For example, "5.4 V104" for
          VSHIELD 5.4 V104.

          NOTE:  Double quotes must be used if a space appears between
                 the release and version numbers.

               The /?, /H, and /HELP options display a help screen.


          CHKSHLD's ERRORLEVELS

               CHKSHLD sets the DOS ERRORLEVEL to the following values:

               ERRORLEVEL ณ DESCRIPTION
               อออออออออออุอออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
                   0      ณ VSHIELD is resident, or if /V is used, the
                          ณ      version specified is resident in memory.
                   1      ณ VSHIELD is resident  but does not match /V
                   2      ณ VSHIELD is NOT resident in memory
                   3      ณ Abnormal termination (program error)


          OPERATION

               CHKSHLD allows network administrators to check workstations
          for VSHIELD before allowing them to log on to a network.
          CHKSHLD is not recommended for home or non-network users.
               A sample login script for Novell NetWare is included in
          Appendix B.

          EXAMPLES

               The following examples show different option settings:

               VSHIELD
                    Installs VSHIELD (Level II protection)

               VSHIELD /CV

                    displayed.





VSHIELD Version 5.56V111                                  Page 16


          INSTALLATION

               For optimum protection, place VSHIELD as the last line in
          your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  If you are using a menu program, place
          VSHIELD before it in the AUTOEXEC.BAT.


          A NOTE ON VSHIELD AND NETWORKS

               If network drivers are loaded after VSHIELD, VSHIELD
          *MUST* be run again with the /RECONNECT option AFTER the network
          drivers are loaded.  This is because network drivers replace the
          normal DOS system interrupts so VSHIELD no longer recognizes
          program loads.

               It is recommended that VSHIELD be used in non-swap mode if 
          free memory permits.  Use of the /SWAP option will slow down the
          system and may cause conflicts with programs that fail to
          allocate memory properly from the system.  If conflicts occur,
          remove the /SWAP option and reboot the system.  If there is not
          enough memory to load VSHIELD in non-swap mode, then VSHIELD1
          should be used instead.

               Networks other than Microsoft LAN Manager with workstations
          running Windows 3.0 and printing to an HPLJ II (or compatible)
          printer over the network occasionally have problems with random
          blocks of memory being sent to the printer when VSHIELD is
          installed.  This is because other network operating systems may
          not redirect the printer correctly.  This can be fixed by
          changing all occurrences of the text "LPT1:" to "LPT1.PRN:"
          while leaving the "LPT1.OS2:" text alone in WIN.INI or upgrading
          to Windows 3.1.

               If VSHIELD is to be run from a network drive, it should be

          booted from a local drive, the /NODISK option should be used.
          If the PC is booted from a boot ROM on a NIC, the /NB switch
          should be used.

          VIRUS REMOVAL

               What do you do if a virus is found?  You can contact McAfee
          Associates for help by BBS, FAX, telephone, Internet, or
          CompuServe.  There is no charge for support calls to McAfee
          Associates.
               The CLEAN-UP universal virus disinfection program can
          disinfect virtually all reported computer viruses.  It is
          updated with each release of the SCAN program to remove new
          viruses.  CLEAN-UP can be downloaded from McAfee Associates'
          BBS, the mcafee.COM site on the Internet, the McAfee Virus
          Help Forum on CompuServe, or from any of the agents listed in
          the enclosed AGENTS.TXT file.
               It is strongly recommended that you get experienced help in
          dealing with viruses if you are unfamiliar with anti-virus
          software and methods.  This is especially true for 'critical'
          viruses and partition table/boot sector infecting viruses as
          improper removal of these viruses can result in the loss of all
          data and use of the infected disk(s).  [For a listing of critical
          viruses, please refer to the VIRUSCAN documentation.]
               For qualified assistance in removing a virus, please
          contact McAfee Associates directly or any of the Authorized
          McAfee Associates Agents in your area.  Agents may charge McAfee
          Associates normal support rates for their services.
               If you wish to remove a file-infecting virus manually, you
          can run SCAN with the /A and /D switches to erase all infected
          files.
               Before removing a boot sector and partition table-infecting
          virus, it is recommended that you cold boot the infected PC from
          a clean DOS disk and backup any critical data.

          APPENDIX A:  Creating an Exception List for the /CERTIFY Option


          NOTE:  The /CERTIFY option is for use in environments where a
                 significant risk of virus infection from unauthorized
                 software exists.  It is not for environments where new
                 software is introduced on a continuous basis.

               Exception List data files created with an editor or word
          processor must be saved as ASCII text files.  Be sure each line
          ends with a CR/LF pair.

                 When VSHIELD is used with the /CERTIFY option only files
          that have been validated by SCAN are allowed to run.  If
          /CERTIFY with an Exception List is used on a system with no
          files validated by SCAN then only the files listed in the
          Exception List will be allowed to run.

               The Exception List uses the following format:

          d:\pathnam1\filenam1.ext
          *comment
               .
               .
          d:\pathnam1\filenam2.ext
          *more comments


          Where "d:" is the name of the drive, "\pathnam1\" is the name of
          the path, and "filename.ext" is the name of the file, including
          the extension.  An Exception List can be up to 1,000 characters
          long.   Comment lines are preceded with an asterisk "*" and are
          ignored by VSHIELD.

               Running /CERTIFY without an exception list will prevent all
          programs other than DOS internal commands from being run.

          APPENDIX B:  Miscellaneous Application Notes

          SAMPLE NOVELL LOGIN SCRIPT AND .BAT FILE FOR VSHIELD AND CHKSHLD

               The following is a sample system login script for use by
          Novell NetWare system administrators.  The login script gets
          the ERRORLEVEL from Novell NetWare and then displays the error
          messages on the users' screens.  The script exits the user to
          a .BAT file that performs a logout if there is an internal error
          with CHKSHLD, VSHIELD has not been installed, or an older
          version of VSHIELD is present when a PC logs on to a network.

          __________ START OF SAMPLE NOVELL SYSTEM LOGIN SCRIPT __________
          CHKSHLD /V "5.4 V104"
                  IF ERROR_LEVEL = "3" THEN
                          FIRE PHASERS 5 TIMES
                          WRITE "A CHKSHLD internal error has occurred."
                          WRITE "Please contact the Help Desk."
                          #COMMAND /C NOLOGIN.BAT
                  EXIT
          ELSE
                  IF ERROR_LEVEL = "2" THEN
                          FIRE PHASERS 5 TIMES
                          WRITE "VSHIELD has not been installed on your PC."
                          WRITE "Access Denied.  Please contact the Help Desk."
                          #COMMAND /C NOLOGIN.BAT
                  EXIT
          ELSE
                  IF ERROR_LEVEL = "1" THEN
                          FIRE PHASERS 5 TIMES
                          WRITE "An old version of VSHIELD has been installed."
                          WRITE "Access to the network has been denied.  Please"
                          WRITE "contact the Help Desk to have a new version
                          WRITE "installed."
                          #COMMAND /C NOLOGIN.BAT
                  EXIT
              END
            END
          END
          ___________ END OF SAMPLE NOVELL SYSTEM LOGIN SCRIPT ___________

          _______________ START OF SAMPLE nologin.bat FILE _______________
          ECHO OFF
          REM Log the user off of the network
          LOGOUT
          ________________ END OF SAMPLE nologin.bat FILE ________________

          More complex login scripts can be created to send a message to
          the supervisor if an error has occurred, update the user's
          VSHIELD.EXE as he logs in to the network, etc.  For security
          purposes, the NOLOGIN.BAT file should be placed on the user's
          local hard disk.

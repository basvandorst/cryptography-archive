               Installation Procedures for WinPGP 1.0

Step 1 - UnZIP WINPGP.ZIP and put the files into a temporary diretory
         on your hard drive, or on a floppy disc.  (You must have already
         done this in order to read this file.)

Step 2 - Run SETUP.EXE from Windows.  This will prompt you for a drive and
         directory onto which to install WinPGP 1.0

Step 3 - Once the SETUP program has completed successfully, you may remove
         the files in the temporary directory.

Step 4 - Perform the validation routine as described in WINPGP.HLP to ensure
         that this is a valid, unmodified version of WinPGP.

Step 5 - Run WINPGP.EXE by double clicking on the icon in Program Manager.

Step 6 - Enjoy WinPGP and send copies of it to all of your friends.

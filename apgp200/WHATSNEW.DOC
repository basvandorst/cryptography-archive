What's new in AutoPGP version 2.00?

1. AutoPGP now allows you to encrypt a message to multiple recipients.
   If the message that is to be encrypted is marked as 'public', AutoPGP
   will let you use up to 10 different public keys (including your own).
2. If a message contains an Internet header, AutoPGP will use the 'To:'
   and 'From:' fields rather than the corresponding QWK fields.
3. The syntax of the [PGP ENCRYPT] directive has been extended in order
   to let you specify which public key to use: [PGP ENCRYPT userid]
4. AutoPGP now lets you use the following macros in the TagLine variable:
   %ver (AutoPGP version number) and %regno (your registration number).
5. Fixed a bug that would sometimes give runtime error 203 (heap
   overflow) when processing very large QWK messages (>60 Kb).
6. Fixed a bug that would not allow you to omit the log file.
7. Fixed a bug that would sometimes cause a sharing violation under
   DesqView or if AutoPGP was run from inside the mail reader.
8. AutoPGP now displays a warning message before attempting to execute
   a command line string of more than 127 characters.

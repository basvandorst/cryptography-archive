0. About this FAQ

   This document aims at answering some of the most common questions
   and problems posed to me by users of AutoPGP. Before you contact me
   with your questions, bug reports or other comments on AutoPGP, be
   sure to read this file. If you don't find what you are looking for
   here, then you can e-mail me at: staalesc@ifi.uio.no.


1. General questions

   1.1. What is AutoPGP?

        AutoPGP is a program that integrates PGP encryption into your
        offline mail reader. AutoPGP lets you encrypt, decrypt and
        sign e-mail messages, as well as to include and extract public
        keys and ascii armoured files in the messages. The operation
        is truly seamless, and all interfacing with PGP is carried out
        automatically, with only a minimum of interaction from the
        user. AutoPGP will run on any MS-DOS compatible computer and
        can be used with any QWK reader, as well as XBoard and
        Offliner, two popular Norwegian mail readers that use the MBBS
        grab format rather than QWK.

   1.2. What is the current version of AutoPGP?

        The latest version of AutoPGP is 2.00. It was released on May
        4, 1994 and replaced v2.0 beta 5 which had a few bugs.

   1.3. Where can I obtain AutoPGP?

        AutoPGP can be downloaded from most major FTP sites that carry
        PGP. In particular, you may try:

        ftp.dsi.unimi.it/pub/security/crypt/PGP/apgp200.zip
        ftp.gar.no/bbs/word/apgp200.zip

        Some BBSes in Norway and the US are also known to carry
        AutoPGP:

        SoundServer                  47-22-571600 / 47-22-571604
        Hieroglyphic Voodoo Machine  1-303-443-2457
        Colorado Catacombs           1-303-938-9654
        Group One                    1-312-752-1258 / 1-312-752-6528

        If you have access to WWW, you may even try the URL:

        http://www.ifi.uio.no/~staalesc/AutoPGP.html

   1.4. Is there a virus in DECRYPT.EXE?

        All AutoPGP .EXE files contain an internal CRC check to
        prevent hackers, NSA employees and other curious persons from
        tampering with the program. This CRC check will also easily
        detect if a file has been infected by a virus, and abort with
        an error message. If AutoPGP is running, it is not infected by
        a virus. However, some anti-virus utilities (Norton AntiVirus,
        Integrity Master a.o.) FALSELY report that beta 5 of
        DECRYPT.EXE contains a Mutation Engine (MtE) virus.

   1.5. Can I pay the registering fee using a credit card?

        No, at the moment you can't. If you live outside Norway,
        International (Postal) Money Order is the only way to pay the
        registering fee. Users in Norway may use POSTGIRO 0825 0719036
        or BANKGIRO 1627.31.82776. I will see if I can find other
        alternatives for foreign users, though.


2. Some common problems

   2.1. Why does not AutoPGP find the correct public key for
        encrypting a message?

        If you don't specify a userid for the [PGP ENCRYPT] directive,
        AutoPGP will look at the name of the recipient of the message
        to see if it can be deduced which public key should be used.
        Here is how AutoPGP finds the recipient's name:

        1.  First it will look in the recipient field in the QWK
            message header.
        2.  If the QWK recipient field says 'INTERNET GATEWAY@XXX',
            AutoPGP will look at the first line in the message body.
            If this line contains an Internet address, AutoPGP will
            use this name instead.
        3.  If the message body contains an Internet header, AutoPGP
            will use the 'To:'-field as the name of the recipient,
            rather than the name given in the QWK header.

        Now AutoPGP knows the name (or the Internet address) of the
        recipient of the message. Normally, this should be enough to
        find the correct key in your public key ring. There are,
        however, times when this is not possible:

        -   you don't have the recipient's public key in your keyring
            (obviously)
        -   you have accidentally misspelled the recipient's name or
            Internet address
        -   the name in the userid of the recipient's public key
            differs from the login name he is using on the BBS
        -   the recipient has several Internet addresses, and they are
            not all listed in his or her userids
        -   the name of the recipient has been truncated, because the
            QWK recipient field has a limit of 25 characters
        -   the recipient has more than one public key, and AutoPGP
            does not know which one to use

        If any of these situations should arise, then AutoPGP cannot
        figure out which public key to use. Instead, you will have to
        pick the correct key manually. You will also be prompted
        whether you would like to use the key you chose for later
        messages to the same person. If you answer Y(es) to this
        question, AutoPGP will update the KEYS.DAT file in your
        AutoPGP directory so that the next time you encrypt a message
        to this person, AutoPGP will know which key to use.

   2.2. The AutoEncrypt feature does not seem to work. Is this a bug?

        The AutoEncrypt feature works very well, provided that the
        following two criteria are met:

        a.  The message that is to be encrypted must be marked as
            'private'. Public messages will not be encrypted (unless,
            of course, you use the '[PGP ENCRYPT]' directive).

        b.  AutoPGP must be able to sort out that you have the
            recipient's public key in your keyring. If the name of the
            recipient differs from the name in the userid of the key,
            AutoPGP will think that you don't have the required public
            key. However, if you have previously told AutoPGP which
            key to use for this person (i.e. when encrypting
            manually), the KEYS.DAT file in your AutoPGP directory is
            updated and AutoPGP will know which key to use. (Also see
            2.1.)

   2.3. Why do I keep getting 'Bad signature' on my clearsigned
        messages?

        a.  If you are using version 2.3 of PGP, you should upgrade to
            2.3a. Version 2.3 had a problem with clearsigned messages,
            which has been fixed in 2.3a.

        b.  Most BBS systems have a limit on the number of characters
            allowed per message line (usually in the range 72-80). If
            you write a message that contains very long lines, the
            excess characters will either be stripped or word-wrapped
            to the next line. This may have consequences for
            clearsigned messages, because PGP will give you a 'Bad
            signature' error if the message has been altered by the
            BBS system (or anyone else, for that matter). If you use
            a line length of no more than 70 characters, you should be
            on the safe side.


3. Hints and tips

   3.1. What can I do to speed up AutoPGP?

        PGP encryption and decryption are very time-consuming
        operations, and usually there is not much you can do about
        that part (unless you buy a faster CPU). However, there are a
        few tricks that will normally reduce the running time of
        AutoPGP:

        a.  If you have a RAM disk installed on your system, you
            should set the TMP environment variable to point at it.
            This will cause both PGP and AutoPGP to use the RAM disk
            rather than the harddisk for storing temporary files,
            thereby reducing the overall running time. See AUTOPGP.DOC
            for details.

        b.  If your mail reader lets you specify the full command line
            string that will be passed to your archiving program, you
            should use the fastest (and simplest) compression method
            available. For example, if you are using PkZip, you should
            specify that the .REP files be packed using the '-e0' (no
            compression) option. Since the .REP files will be unpacked
            by ENCRYPT anyway, there is no point in vasting time on
            compression. When ENCRYPT is finished processing the
            messages, it will repack the .REP files using normal
            compression.

        c.  If you login to only one or a few BBSes, then it could be
            a good idea to modify your READ.BAT file so that AutoPGP
            will not start unless any mail packets are present. For
            instance, if you are only going to use AutoPGP on 'MyBBS',
            you should modify the lines that call DECRYPT and ENCRYPT:

            IF EXIST C:\READER\QWK\MYBBS.QWK DECRYPT.EXE
            IF EXIST C:\READER\REP\MYBBS.REP ENCRYPT.EXE

            This will save time, because then DECRYPT and ENCRYPT will
            not have to initialize themselves and read the AUTOPGP.CFG
            configuration file only to find that there is nothing to
            do.

   3.2. How can I use AutoPGP to review or re-edit outgoing messages
        that have already been encrypted?

        You can't. If the .REP files have already been processed by
        ENCRYPT, then the messages are encrypted and further editing
        is pointless. In order to alter the contents of an encrypted
        message, you will have to save it to a file, manually decrypt
        it using PGP, and then re-import it into the mail reader. With
        a little thought it is possible to avoid such situations,
        though. Here are two suggestions:

        a.  If your mail reader has a message base or 'folder' in
            which outgoing messages are stored, you should wait until
            the last possible minute (i.e. just before uploading the
            messages) before you export the messages to the .REP file.

        b.  Another way to postpone the use of ENCRYPT is simply to
            remove it from the READ.BAT file. Instead, you can create
            a new batch file that will call ENCRYPT and your
            communications program - in that order. In this way you
            can ensure that ENCRYPT will not be called until just
            before the messages are uploaded.

   3.3. How do I use AutoPGP under a multitasking environment?

        There are usually no problems involved in using AutoPGP under
        a multitasking environment, such as Windows, DesQView or OS/2.
        The only thing you should be aware of, is the fact that
        READ.BAT will only call DECRYPT once before starting your mail
        reader. If you are downloading new .QWK packets in one window
        while reading and writing messages in another, you will have
        to make sure that DECRYPT is run once again before you import
        the new .QWK packets into your mail reader. Otherwise the
        incoming messages will not be decrypted. This could be
        accomplished by running DECRYPT manually in a separate window,
        or by creating a batch file that will automatically call
        DECRYPT just after you have quit your communications program.
        Some mail readers will also let you define external programs
        that can be run from inside the reader itself.


4. Security issues

   4.1. Where does AutoPGP store my pass phrase?

        When AutoPGP needs your pass phrase in order to unlock your
        secret key, it will first look in the PGPPASS environment
        variable to see if the pass phrase is defined here. If it is
        not, or if the pass phrase found in PGPPASS is incorrect,
        AutoPGP will prompt you for the correct pass phrase. The pass
        phrase which you enter is stored in an internal variable
        inside the DECRYPT (or ENCRYPT) program in case the program
        needs to access your secret key more than once. It is NOT
        stored in the PGPPASS environment variable (unless
        KeepPassPhrase is set to 'Yes', see below), neither is it
        placed in a separate file on your harddisk or anywhere else
        where it could easily be found. Once DECRYPT (or ENCRYPT) is
        finished, the pass phrase will be erased from memory and
        overwritten by other data, making it impossible for other
        programs to scan the memory for anything that might look like
        a pass phrase. However, if the KeepPassPhrase option in
        AUTOPGP.CFG is set to 'Yes', DECRYPT (or ENCRYPT) will copy
        your pass phrase to the PGPPASS environment variable before
        exiting the program. Although this may seem convenient, since
        it makes it possible to run AutoPGP multiple times without
        having to retype the pass phrase each time, this option should
        be used with extreme caution! If your computer is connected to
        a network, or if there are other people than yourself that are
        likely to use your computer, you should leave the
        KeepPassPhrase option alone and NOT use PGPPASS to store your
        pass phrase.

   4.2. Once AutoPGP has decrypted my incoming mail, it is stored as
        plaintext on my harddisk. How can I protect these data from a
        potential intruder?

        This is one of the main hazards of using a program like
        AutoPGP. Although AutoPGP makes it very easy to send encrypted
        messages safely through e-mail channels, once the messages are
        transferred to your computer, they are decrypted and stored
        unencrypted on your harddisk, making it possible for anyone
        who has access to your computer to be able to read your
        private mail. Using a power-on password check built-in to your
        ROM or BIOS offers at least a minimum of protection, but if
        your computer is connected to a network, or if there is more
        than one person using it, this is usually not enough.
        Fortunately, there exists a number of programs which allow you
        to password protect parts of your harddisk. Some of these
        (such as Norton Diskreet) use very simple encryption (e.g.
        DES), but there are currently being developed more advanced
        harddisk encryption programs, some of which are highly
        recommendable. These include:

        þ SecureDrive v1.3c by Mike Ingle and Edgar Swank (not to be
          exported from the USA).
        þ Secure File System (SFS) v1.0 by Peter Gutmann, co-author
          of PGP.
        þ SecureDevice v1.2 by Max Loewenthal and Arthur Helwig.

        The programs can be downloaded by anonymous FTP from:

        soda.berkeley.edu/pub/cypherpunks/crypto/secdr13c.zip
        garbo.uwasa.fi/pc/crypt/sfs100.zip
        wuarchive.wust.edu/pub/MSDOS_UPLOADS/cryptography/secdev12.arj

        All three programs are freeware, and they all use IDEA
        encryption, the same algorithm as found in PGP. If you are
        truly concerned about your safety, you should consider
        obtaining one of these programs. With these you can encrypt
        the harddisk partitions where PGP, AutoPGP and your mail
        reader are stored, making it impossible for people who do not
        have the correct password to read your mail, although they
        have access to all other parts of your computer hardware.

   4.3. How can I be sure that AutoPGP does not contain any hidden
        instructions to give away my secret key and pass phrase and
        send them in an encrypted message to the NSA or anyone else?

        Well, to put it bluntly: You can't. Since AutoPGP is shareware
        and the source code is not publicly accessible, there is no
        way you can be 100% sure that I, the author, have not included
        any 'back doors' or other undocumented functions into AutoPGP.
        However, since all outgoing, encrypted messages generated by
        AutoPGP are also encrypted with your own public key, you have
        at all times full control of what goes out from your computer.
        If one of your messages suddenly contains any strange
        characters that you did not put there yourself, then you know
        that something odd is going on. Or similarly, if PGP one day
        refuses to decrypt your own messages because you do not have
        the required public key, it would certainly arouse your
        suspicion. In fact, the only possible way (at least that I can
        think of) in which AutoPGP would be able to include any extra,
        hidden information in your outgoing mail without you knowing
        it, would be if it generated TWO messages, one of which
        contained the actual message, encrypted with both the
        recipients' and your own key, and another, hidden message
        which was encrypted with someone else's key (probably mine or
        one belonging to the NSA). If these two messages were merged
        into one file, then an attempt to decrypt the file with PGP
        would only reveal the first message. This is because PGP stops
        after decrypting the first message, even if the file contains
        more PGP messages. (Maybe something to think about in future
        versions of PGP?) So in order to verify that the messages
        generated by AutoPGP does not contain any hidden information,
        you will have to check the files manually or write a program
        that does it for you. (The PGP file format is explained in the
        file PGFORMAT.DOC, which is distributed together with the PGP
        source code.) Of course, since you will not check every single
        message generated by AutoPGP, you cannot be sure that in one
        of every hundred messages, AutoPGP will not append your pass
        phrase, secret key or other information in a 'tail message'
        following the real message. But this is only theoretically
        possible, because if AutoPGP really contained such an
        instruction, then you could be sure that someone would
        eventually find out about it. (And just imagine what this
        would mean to me and my credibility!) In fact, the best
        guarantee you have that AutoPGP is not doing anything
        mischievous or dishonest, is the growing number of people
        using the program. The more people who use AutoPGP, the
        greater the chance that someone would find out about it,
        should the program contain any such hidden instructions.


5. Future releases

   5.1. Will there be a SOUP version of AutoPGP?

        Yes, there will. SOUP support is one of the features that I am
        planning to add in future versions of AutoPGP. I hope to have
        a SOUP version of AutoPGP ready this summer/autumn.

   5.2. Will my mail reader be recognized by the next version of
        INSTALL?

        If your QWK mail reader is not listed by the INSTALL program,
        or if you are using a newer version than the one which is
        listed, please let me know. I would also like a copy of your
        mail reader's configuration file (i.e. the file where the QWK
        and REP directories are specified). Currently INSTALL only
        recognizes DOS-based readers, but in later versions I will
        probably add some of the most popular Windows and OS/2
        readers.

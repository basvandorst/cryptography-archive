Thank you for trying WPGP. You may use this program only for evaluation
purposes for 30 days. Then you must either register it, for a fee of $35,
or you must stop using it. You can redistribute this archive, but only if
you keep it intact. You can obtain information on how to register by
pressing Order Info button on the initial shareware screen.

WPGP is an integration tool that will extract text from windows, process
it through PGP, and place the result back in the window.

In order to install WPGP, execute the program INSTALL.EXE from this
archive. Either run it from the FILE/RUN menu option of the Windows
3.1 Program Manager, or from the DOS command line. If you run this from a
DOS command line, it will load windows and begin to execute. WPGP will
create a new PM group and install itself there. The first time you
run, you will be brought to the Setup screen. There is a section in
the Help file called "Quick Start" that explains the minimum you need
to do to run WPGP. I've kept it quite short, and reading it will save
you lots of time and trouble.

Finally, please make sure the PGP is installed and working properly before
you try to use WPGP. WPGP depends on PGP working. If PGP doesn't work,
WPGP can't work.

After you get going, please spend some time with the help file. It
thoroughly cover the features of WPGP.

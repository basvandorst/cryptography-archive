                         -- Quick Start for FTPNuz --

If you want to use FTPNuz immediately, follow these instructions:

  - Select a directory from which to execute FTPNuz (e.g. C:\NEWS).  
    Copy all files into this directory and make it the "current"
    directory:

              C:
              MD \NEWS
              CD \NEWS
              PKUNZIP FTPNUZ10
              FTPNUZ

  - Execute the program.   The first time, you will be prompted for 
    the necessary setup information.   Note that *all* fields on the
    "Setup" screen are required for proper operation.   Here is the
    information you will need:

            * Domain name or IP address of NNTP server to which you
              have access.

            * Your EMail UserID and Host domain name.

  - After setup is complete, you have 2 alternatives.   If you know the
    exact names of groups you wish to read, use the "Subscribe" selection
    from the "Group" menu.   If you do not know the names, use the 
    "List All" selection from the "Group" menu to list all groups
    maintained by your server.   Select groups form this list which you
    wish to follow.

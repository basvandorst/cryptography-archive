What is FTPNuz?

  FTPNuz is a DOS client for accessing a Usenet news server.   It
  uses the FTP Software, Inc. PC/TCP kernel to provide the TCP/IP
  base.   This is not to be confused with the Packet Driver standard,
  also written by FTP Software.   To use FTPNuz, you need a kernel
  for your type of network connection (Ethernet, Token Ring, PPP, etc.)
  and access to an NNTP server.


FTPNuz is shareware.

  I wrote FTPNuz in my spare time.   If you find it to be useful, please
  register your copy by sending $10 (US) to the address below.   This
  will help to reduce my cost of development and encourage improvements
  and other useful programs.   I will notify registered users of fixes
  and new versions of FTPNuz as well as other programs I develop.

  To report problems with FTPNuz, send a detailed description of the
  problem to the address below or to my Compuserve ID:

      Gene Mangum
      7108 Stony Creek Rd.
      Ypsilanti, MI  48197

      Compuserve: 72357,3547
        Internet: 72357.3547@compuserve.com

  Please include the version of FTPNuz, where you obtained your copy,
  the version and type of FTP kernel, whether you're running under
  MS Windows, and your EMail address.   I also welcome suggestions
  for enhancements.



FTPNuz files:

  FTPNUZ.EXE  -  The executable program.
  FTPNUZ.DOC  -  This file.
  FTPNUZ.PRM* -  Parameter settings like your name, EMail address, and
                 NNTP server.
  FTPNUZ.GRP* -  Information about the groups you subscribe to and which
                 messages you have read.
  FTPNUZ.SIG  -  Optional file containing up to 10 lines of text for your
                 "signature".   These lines are appended to each article
                 you post or mail.

  * - These files are created if they do not exist in the "current
      directory".   This means that you should always start FTPNuz
      from the same directory (i.e. always CD \FTPNUZ before starting
      FTPNuz).   In a network environment, you can have multiple
      users share the same executable.   Just have each user point to
      his own directory for the parm files and d:\ftpnuz\FTPNUZ).


Using FTPNuz

  FTPNuz is a menu-driven program with hotkeys defined for most functions.
  If you have a mouse and a valid (not too old) mouse driver, it may be
  used.   The top line of the screen is the main menu.   The sub-menu for
  a main menu function may be "pulled down" using the "Alt" key plus the
  highlighted letter (e.g. Alt-S for the Session sub-menu).   A special
  case is the system menu (๐) which uses Alt-Space.   You may then type
  just the highlighted letter for the sub-menu function to select it.
  When using a mouse, just click on the item you wish to select.

  The last screen line is a status line.   This serves as a context-
  sensitive reminder for some hotkeys.   Using a mouse, you may also
  click on an item on the status line to select it.   Note that not all
  selectable functions are necessarily displayed on the status line.

  When a menu or status line item is "grayed" it is not currently
  selectable (not applicable).   For example, "Disconnect" is grayed if
  you are not currently connected to the server.

  In addition, the current time is displayed in the upper right corner
  of the screen (on the main menu line).   The amount of free memory in
  bytes (characters) is displayed in the lower right corner (on the
  status line).

  The area between the menu bar and the status line is called the
  "desktop".   It contains windows and dialogs which are displayed as
  needed.


Anatomy of a Window

  FTPNuz uses text-mode windows to display information such as article
  text.   A Window is a rectangular area surrounded by a frame.   A
  double-line frame indicates that the window is active and you may
  interact with it.   A single border indicates that the window is
  disabled.

  Near the upper left corner of a window is a small block enclosed in
  square brackets.   You may click the mouse on this block to close
  the window.   Some windows have scroll bars on the right and bottom.
  These may be used to scroll the information in the window.   Near
  the upper right of some windows is an arrow enclosed in square
  brackets.   Click on this to toggle the window between full-size and
  the (unzoomed) size you make it by resizing.

  If the lower right corner of a window has a segment of single line
  border the window is resizable.   You may drag this single line border
  to resize the window.   Windows may be moved by dragging the top edge
  of the frame using the mouse.   See the "MENU SELECTIONS" section
  for methods of window manipulation using the keyboard.


MENU SELECTIONS


  The System Menu (๐)

    About:  Displays program information.

    Calendar:  Displays a calendar.   Use the arrows to display a
      different month.


  The SESSION Menu

    The first time you execute FTPNuz from a given directory, you will
    be taken automatically into 2 setup screens.   The first allows you
    to specify required information as follows:

      Setup

        News Server:  The domain name or IP address of the NNTP server
          to which FTPNuz is to connect.

        Your Name:  Your name as you wish it to appear on the "FROM"
          line in the header of articles you post.

        Organization:  The name of your company/university/etc. placed
          in the "Organization" line in the header of articles you
          post.

        UserID and Host:  The UserID and Host portions of your EMail
          address.   These two fields constitute your address on the
          "FROM" line in the header of articles you post.   Do not
          include an "@" in either of these fields.

        TimeZone:  The time zone from which you are posting (e.g.
          EDT, CST)


    Preferences are options which control how FTPNuz operates:

      Preferences

        Connect to Server at start-up:  Check this box to automatically
          connect to the News Server when you invoke FTPNuz.

        Article List:  Specifies whether to show just the title of
          articles or title plus name of person who posted the article.

        Sort by:  Specifies whether to list articles in numeric order
          or by thread (grouping related follow-up articles).   Thread
          order actually uses the subject text to group articles.

        Screen Mode:  For an EGA or VGA, allows more lines on the
          screen.

        Max articles to list:  Useful for slower network connections or
          memory-constrained systems, limits the number of articles
          obtained at one time.


    Connect and Disconnect

      These selections allow you to establish and terminate a TCP
      session with your news server.

    Verbose Log/Terse Log

      The connection log is primarily for debugging.   The Verbose
      setting lists all traffic between the server and your session,
      while the Terse setting only lists connect/terminate messages
      and article number ranges when a group is selected.

    DOS Shell

      Allows you to escape to DOS temporarily without losing your
      session.

    Exit

      Exit terminates your session and returns to DOS.


  The EDIT Menu

    The "Edit" menu offers clipboard functions for reading and
    composing articles.   The clipboard retains its contents during
    a single execution of FTPNuz.

      Undo:  Cancels the last "Edit" function.

      Cut:  Removes the selected text from the editor and places it
        in the clipboard.

      Copy:  Places a copy of the selected text in the clipboard.

      Paste:  Places the clipboard contents into the editor at the
        cursor location.

      Paste File:  Places the contents of a disk file into the editor
        at the cursor location.

      Show Clipboard:  Displays the clipboard contents in an editor.

      Clear:  Removes the selected text from the editor.

      Search:  While viewing/editing an article, this allows you to
        search for a text string in the editor.   The search begins
        at the cursor location.

      Search Again:  Repeats the last Search forward from the cursor
        location.

      ROT-13:  Applies a simple encoding algorithm to the text in the
        clipboard.   This method is sometimes used in newsgroups to
        encode text.   This function both encodes and decodes the text.
        To include encoded text in an article first type the text, then
        cut it to the clipboard, encode it using ROT-13, and paste it
        back into the article.

  The GROUP Menu

    Subscribe:  If you know the exact name of the newsgroup, you may
      enter it into your subscription list.   The name is not verified
      until you select it from the group list.

    List All Groups:  Lists all newsgroups known to your server.   You
      may select groups from this list by double-clicking with the
      mouse, or using the arrow keys and the space bar or ENTER.   You
      may also position the list if you know the first few characters
      of the group name you want.   Press ESC to reset this prefix string.
      Click on the "Save List" button (or tab to it and press ENTER)
      to save the list of subscribed and unsubscribed groups to a
      disk file called "NEWSGRP.LST".   This file may be used to
      search for text in group names.

    Catch Up:  Allows you to mark articles as read without having to
      list them.   This function displays a dialog which asks how many
      articles you wish to retain.   For example, you can mark read
      all but the last 20 articles in the group.   Note that the number
      entered is subtracted from the group's highest article number to
      set the lower bound for articles.   If some of the articles in
      this range are missing you may actually get fewer than the number
      you specify.   You can also use this function to mark the last
      n articles unread if you are already caught up.

    Scan Groups:  Scans forward in the group list for the next newsgroup
      with unread messages.


  The ARTICLE Menu

    Read:  Displays the text of the selected article.

    Follow-up:  This options starts the editor with the text of the
      current article quoted (using ">" in front of each line).   After
      editing, the new article may be posted to newsgroups or sent to
      an EMail (SMTP) server.

    Compose:  Starts the editor to compose a new article for submission.

    Skip:  Marks the current article "read" without displaying the
      text.

    Read All:  Marks all listed articles as "read" without displaying
      the text.

    Read Next:  Displays the text of the next article in the list.

    Unread:  Flags a previously read article as unread so that it
      may be saved for future reading.

    Unread All:  Obtains a list of all articles which the server has
      whether or not they have been read.

    Save:  Saves the text of the current article to a disk file.

    Print:  Prints the text of the current article.



  The WINDOW Menu

    Resize/Move:  Selecting this option allows you to move any window
      using the keyboard.   Use the arrow keys to move the window, and
      press ENTER when complete.   To move with a mouse, simply drag
      the window using the top of the window frame.   Windows which
      are resizable (look at the lower right corner  of the window for
      a difference in the frame) may be changed using the SHIFT key
      plus the arrow keys.   Using the mouse, simply drag the lower
      right corner of the frame to resize.

    Zoom:  Makes a resizable window fill the screen area (except the
      lines for the menu bar and status line).

    Next:  This may be used to cycle through the available windows on
      the desktop.

    Close:  Closes the current window.



Miscellaneous

  Sending an article via EMail (SMTP)

    FTPNuz allows you to reply to or forward an article as well as
    compose and send a message via SMTP EMail.   After selecting
    "Compose" or "Follow-up", options for posting and mailing will
    appear on the status line.   For "Follow-up", the poster's
    User ID and Host are filled in as the default address.

  Signature File

    If the file "FTPNUZ.SIG" exists in the current directory, it is
    assumed to be a text (CrLf) file which contains up to 10 lines
    of text which are appended to each article you post.   This "sig"
    file commonly contains your name, company, and EMail address.

  Articles are limited to 64K

    The editor/viewer used to display articles has a document size limit
    of 64K (roughly 800-1000 lines) of text.   This is not normally a
    problem.   If you try to view an article larger than the limit, you
    are given the option to save the entire text to a disk file for
    later viewing.

  Why does FTPNuz do "x"?

    Some aspects of the programs behavior may be different from other
    newsreaders.   I am always open to suggestions, so please feel free
    to compare and contrast FTPNuz with other programs.

    One of my primary design goals was to make the program work well
    over slower network connections, so sometimes you have to select a
    command when the action could have been made automatic.   Since I
    often read news over a dial-up connection, I try to avoid unnecessary
    reading from the server.

    One area where you might have problems is memory (of course, you're
    running DOS!)   The available memory, in bytes (characters), is
    displayed in the lower right corner of the screen.   If this number
    gets too low, FTPNuz might crash.   Of course there is a trade-off
    between being safe - checking available memory before each allocation
    and performance (speed and code size).   I've taken the approach
    of checking sometimes, but not always, and then providing the
    display of free memory so that you can monitor it.

    Several beta-testers asked for the list of newsgroups to include
    an article count.   I have not yet decided whether to implement
    this feature, but if I do in a future release (based on user
    requests) it will be optional.   The problem is that to show the
    number of unread articles - articles which YOU have not read -
    requires a significant amount of network traffic.   For large
    groups and for many groups, the delay at startup would be
    prohibitive.   If you really want this feature, write and let
    me know.


  Common Abbreviations

    There are many abbreviations which are often used in Usenet
    messages as well as EMail.   Here are some of the most popular
    ones:

      BTW         - By the way
      IMHO        - In my humble opinion
      IMNSHO      - In my not-so-humble opinion
      OTOH        - On the other hand
      ROF,L       - Rolling on floor, laughing (not common, but I like it)
      RTFM        - Read the <fine> manual
      :-)         - A smiley (look at it sideways)
      ;-)         - Winking smiley
      :-(         - Frowny

    There are many, many more of these.   A huge list of smileys is
    regularly posted to "rec.humor", so if you're interested, just
    watch that group.


  Possible Future Enhancements

    - Separate program to edit GRP file list.   This would allow you to
      manually specify ranges of article numbers to skip, or to correct
      errors in these ranges.

    - Context-sensitive help.

    - Options to take advantage of extended server commands; for example
      to search for newsgroup names which contain specified text, etc.

    - A better editor (without the 64K limit).

    - Ability to UUDECODE/UUENCODE article text.

    - A Kill file to automatically exclude articles based on your
      selection criteria.


  Problems

    - I have seen some strange problems with FTPNuz running under MS
      Windows, using PC/TCP 2.1 and greater, and using Expanded Memory
      for the kernel (use-emm=yes in PCTCP.INI).   I *think* I've been
      able to work around them, but I haven't found a good solution yet.
      If you experience unexplained lock-ups under Windows, try changing
      use-emm to "no" and see if the problem clears up.   Please notify
      me so that I can get more information and try to get the problem
      solved.


  Acknowledgments

    I would like to thank all the beta testers who provided valuable
    criticism and ideas.   Special thanks to Scott Mills at S.F. Austin
    State University, who provided an ftp site and account for distributing
    the beta versions of the software, as well as the production code.
    Also, thanks to the tech support folks at FTP Software for their help
    and encouragement.

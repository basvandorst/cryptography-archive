A weary traveler (Ken Bass, kbass@radix.net) once wrote...

   : The new Pine  3.92 release doesn't include  integrated PGP support,
   : but it can be implemented fairly easily using the "display-filters"
   : and  "sending-filters" features.   I would  be suprised  if scripts
   : don't start showing up soon...

   By all means, send them my way!
   
I use these...which are based on those posted by someone on comp.mail.pine.

/usr/local/bin/PGP-Check
- ----
#!/bin/sh
/usr/local/bin/pgp
sleep 5

/usr/local/bin/PGP-Encrypt
- ----
#!/bin/sh
pgp -feast
- ----

/usr/local/bin/PGP-Sign
- ----
#!/bin/sh
pgp -fast

In Pine, I set:
display-filters=_LEADING("-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----")_ /usr/local/
bin/PGP-Check
sending-filters=/usr/local/bin/PGP-Sign,/usr/local/bin/PGP-Encrypt

Be happy...

  PGPShell can be ordered through VISA/MC or by check/money order.
  
  Ten-percent of all revenues from PGPShell will be donated to the
  Philip Zimmermann Legal Defense Fund in Boulder, Colorado, to assist
  the author of PGP in his long, expensive criminal investigation by
  the U.S. Customs Bureau.  I will personally send a letter to the
  defense fund's attorney, Phil Dubois (and forward a carbon copy 
  directly to Philip Zimmermann) and sign the names of all registered 
  users to the letter indicating the amount of the collective donation, 
  and include the donation in the form of a bank-certified check. 
  Notice of the donation will be posted prominently on at least the
  Hieroglyphic Voodoo Machine BBS and the Cypherpunks Mailing List 
  when it is made.

  To register use this order form, or you can use your VISA or 
  MasterCard to order by calling 1-800-333-HEAR (4327).  Please
  keep in mind that this is an orders-only phone line and that the
  person taking your order cannot answer questions related to User
  Support of PGPShell.
  
  If you would rather "crypto-register" PGPShell, fill out the order
  form, PGP-encrypt it (my public key is included as KEPLER.ASC) and 
  e-mail it to me.  Make sure you encrypt it!  You don't want anyone
  but me to see your charge card number....

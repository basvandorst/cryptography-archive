  PGPShell Version 3.2 License Statement    



                                   LICENSE

  PGPShell is Copyright (c) 1992-1994 by James Still. All Rights Reserved.

  PGPShell is not free software.

  The commercial, registered version of PGPShell may not be duplicated
  other than for backup purposes. A registered copy of PGPShell must be
  treated like a book, in that the same registered copy of PGPShell may
  not be used in more than one computer at the same time, just as a book 
  may not be read by more than one person at the same time in two
  different locations (unless an illegal copy is made!)

  Users are granted a limited license to use the trial version of PGPShell 
  for a limited evaluation period of up to 30 days, in order to determine 
  if it suits their needs.  Any other use of PGPShell or any use past this 
  period requires registration.

  All users are granted a limited license to copy the trial version of 
  PGPShell only for the purpose of allowing others to try it out, subject 
  to the above restrictions as well as these:

       PGPShell must be distributed in absolutely unmodified form,
       including ALL program, documentation, and other files.

       PGPShell may not be included with any other product for any
       reason whatsoever without a license from James Still.

       No charge or payment may be levied or accepted for PGPShell
       above a normal disk handling and operating expense not to 
       exceed $10 per copy, per disk.

  Bulletin Board system operators may post the unregistered, trial
  version of PGPShell on their BBS for downloading by their users
  without written permission only if the above conditions are met,
  and only if no special fee is necessary to access the PGPShell 
  files (a general fee to access the BBS is acceptable but placement 
  of PGPShell in the "free files" section of your BBS is preferred).
  
  Distributors of User Supported and Public Domain software MUST send
  company literature with camera-ready copy, a written letter of 
  notification stating your intent to distribute and your terms, or some 
  other reasonable method of informing me (in writing) that you plan on 
  distributing PGPShell and under what terms.  I'm not worried about pre-
  authorization concerning your choice to distribute, on the contrary I'm 
  flattered, but I must know of your intent to do so ahead of time. 
  
  The following section contains information on registration and 
  licensing.


                 PGPShell Ordering/Registration Information

  Registering (purchasing) PGPShell allows you to use the product after 
  the trial period.  Registered PGPShell users get the current version of 
  PGPShell on disk along with their own serial number, and priority when
  electronically mailing me for User Support (still@rintintin.colorado.edu)
  or on my BBS at +1 303 443 2457 (V.32bis N81).  I cannot guarantee
  User Support to unregistered users, but I will do my best.  To register
  PGPShell with your VISA or MasterCard, call 1-800-333-HEAR (4327).
  Please remember that this is an orders-only line and the person
  that takes your order will not be able to answer questions directly 
  related to PGPShell User Support.

  If you would rather "crypto-register" PGPShell, fill out the order
  form, PGP-encrypt it (my public key is included as KEPLER.ASC) and 
  e-mail it to me.  Make sure you encrypt it!  You don't want anyone
  but me to see your charge card number....


  Ten-percent of all revenues from PGPShell will be donated to the
  Philip Zimmermann Legal Defense Fund in Boulder, Colorado, to assist
  the author of PGP in his long, expensive criminal investigation by
  the U.S. Customs Bureau.  I will personally send a letter to the
  defense fund's attorney, Phil Dubois (and forward a carbon copy 
  directly to Philip Zimmermann) and sign the names of all registered 
  users to the letter indicating the amount of the collective donation, 
  and include the donation in the form of a bank-certified check. 
  Notice of the donation will be posted prominently on at least the
  Hieroglyphic Voodoo Machine BBS and the Cypherpunks Mailing List 
  when it is made.
  
  PGPShell registration costs $20 in U.S. funds, (includes shipping) and 
  a 'registered' copy of PGPShell on disk.  A commercial site license is
  available to government or company entities for a one-time fee of
  $199 in U.S. funds, which has no workstation restrictions.  A bound, 
  printed manual is available at an additional cost of $5 per copy, 
  including shipping charges.  An evaluation disk with the current trial 
  version of PGPShell on it is also available for a $5 fee (again in U.S. 
  funds). This is to be used to try out PGPShell, and does not include 
  registration (the right to use PGPShell after the 30-day evaluation 
  period). The fee covers the cost of the diskette and shipping and 
  handling charges.

  Payment may be in the form of check or money order that I can deposit
  in a U.S. bank.  I will also accept corporate or academic purchase orders 
  for the site license fee only and not the single-user license cost. 
  I must be able to deposit the check into my bank account or I cannot
  process your registration.  Alternatively, you may register PGPShell 
  with your VISA or Mastercard by calling 1-800-333-HEAR (4327).         
  


                     Quantity and Corporate Purchases

  
  A commercial site license is available to government or company
  organizations for a one-time site license fee of $199.  There are
  no restrictions as to the number of workstations your organization
  may use PGPShell on, but the distribution requirements of this
  license agreement still apply.
  
  Organizations which purchase a commercial site license, will be
  registered with a single serial numbered version of PGPShell.
  Additional bound, printed manuals are available under the same terms
  as the single-user license agreement above ($5 per copy, bulk orders
  of manuals are:

                   1  - 12 manuals   $5 per copy
                   13 - 24 manuals   $4 per copy
                   25+               $3 per copy   
                   
  
  Note: All prices are subject to change without notice.  You may be
  billed for additional shipping costs in the event that more than
  50 user manuals are ordered.

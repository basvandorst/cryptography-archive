`` Quantum Conference Key Distribution Systems ''

ABSTRACT
We develop cryptographic protocols for conference key
distribution systems based on the uncertainty principle
in quantum physics. The information theoretical limits
to the system correlation between users are demonstrated
to describe quantum-cryptographically protected multi-user
optical communication channels. An estimation of eveasdropping 
via ``intercept/resend" for each quantum system is given. 
It is shown that such attacks can be revealed from the
information and correlation formalism.

Key wards: Quantum cryptography, Conference key distribution,
Information, Correlation.

``The Relationship Between  Propagation Characteristic 
and Nonlinearity of Cryptographic Functions''

ABSTRACT
The nonlinearity of a Boolean function indicates the
minimum distance between the function and all the affine
functions, while the propagation characteristic of a
Boolean function forecasts the avalanche behavior of the
function when some input bits to the function are
complemented. Both nonlinearity and propagation
characteristic are regarded as critical indicators of the
cryptographic strength of a Boolean function.  A main
contribution of this paper is to reveal the relationship
of the two cryptographic criteria. In particular, we prove
that
(1)	if $f$, a Boolean function on $V_{n}$,
	satisfies the propagation criterion with respect to
	all but a subset $\Re$ of vectors in $V_{n}$,
	then the nonlinearity of $f$ satisfies
	$N_{f}\geq 2^{n-1}-2^{\frac{1}{2}(n+t)-1}$,
	where $t$ is the rank of $\Re$, and
(2)	When $|\Re| > 2$, the nonzero vectors in $\Re$
	are linearly dependent.
Furthermore we show that
(3)	if $|\Re| = 2$ then $n$ must be odd 
	and the nonlinearity of $f$ satisfies
	$N_{f}\geq 2^{n-1}-2^{\frac{1}{2}(n-1)}$,
	and if $|\Re| = 4$ then $n$ must be even
	 and the nonlinearity of $f$ satisfies
	$N_{f}\geq 2^{n-1}-2^{\frac{1}{2}n}$.
	In both cases,
	the nonzero vector(s) in $\Re$
	must be linear structure(s) of $f$.
(4)	there exists no function on $V_n$
	such that $|\Re| = 3$.
Combining (3) with results presented in~\cite{SZZ93p},
we conclude that $|\Re| = 2$ (or 4) if and only if 
$f$ is a two-(or four-)repetition of 
a bent function on $V_{n-1}$ (or $V_{n-2}$).

``Quantum Cryptographic Key Distribution Using An Optical Coupler''

ABSTRACT
We develop a quantum cryptographic key distribution protocol
based on two non-commuting quantum states by utilizing an
optical coupler at the receiver side. Each bit of a cryptographic
signal is encoded using quadrature phase amplitudes, which
cannot be simultaneously measured, according to the uncertainty
principle in quantum physics. Quieter light output can be achieved
in comparison to a conventional theoretical model based on
two nonorthogonal quantum states, when a squeezed laser is used
as incident light of the coupler waveguide.

``Further Comments on the Soviet Encryption Algorithm'' 
 
ABSTRACT
The paper analyses components of GOST Russian encryption
algorithm. First general algebraic properties are described
and the GOST algorithm is compared to the DES algorithm.
Avalanche characteristic of the adder used to mix keys
and partial cryptograms is examined. Cyclic shifts used
to diffuse changes of bits is considered.
A part of the secret key in GOST are S-boxes. Later we
show how users can generate S-boxes for the algorithm.
At the end we comment on diffrential cryptanalysis and 
linear cryptanalysis of the GOST.

``Soviet Encryption Algorithm ''

ABSTRACT
This report describes the Soviet (now Russian) encryption
algorithm.  The details of the algorithm were published
in 1990 as the Soviet Standard (GOST 28147-89) \cite{gost89}.
The algorithm provides a level of security of information 
that is flexible and which can be used to protect information 
in computer systems and computer networks.  The algorithm
can be implemented in both hardware and software.

``Linear Approximation Versus Nonlinearity''

ABSTRACT
Recently Matsui announced an attack on the DES algorithm.
The attack relies on approximation of S-boxes by linear
functions.  To find out the best linear approximation,
Matsui defines the linear approximation tables (LAT)
for S-boxes.  In this work we examine the relation between
Matsui's linear approximation tables and nonlinearities
of corresponding S-boxes.

``A Practical Electronic Voting Protocol Using
  Threshold schemes''

ABSTRACT
The paper presents a novel secret voting scheme which fully
conforms to the requirements of large scale elections.
The participants in the scheme are voters, candidates, an
administrator, and a counter. The scheme uses threshold encryption
to preserve the privacy and accuracy of the votes against dishonesty
of voters, candidates, the administrator, and the counter.
It also ensures verifiability, fairness, and soundness of the
voting process and hence neither administrator nor
candidates, or the counter is capable top produce false tally,
affecting the voting result, or corrupting/disrupting the election.

``GAC --- the Criterion for Global Avalanche Characteristics
of Cryptographic Functions''

ABSTRACT
We show that some widely accepted criteria for cryptographic
Boolean functions, including the strict avalanche criterion (SAC)
and the propagation criterion, have various limitations in 
capturing properties of vital importance to cryptographic
algorithms, and propose a new criterion called GAC to measure
the global avalanche characteristics of cryptographic functions.
We also introduce two indicators related to the new criterion,
one forecasts the {\em sum-of-squares\/} while the other
the {\em absolute\/} avalanche characteristics of a function. 
Lower and upper bounds on the two indicators are derived,
and two methods are presented to construct cryptographic
functions that achieve nearly optimal global avalanche
characteristics.

``Characterizing the Structures of Highly Nonlinear
Cryptographic Functions''

ABSTRACT
This paper studies the properties and constructions of nonlinear
functions, which are a core component of cryptographic primitives
including data encryption algorithms and one-way hash functions.
A main contribution of this paper is to reveal the relationship
between nonlinearity and propagation characteristic, two
critical indicators of the cryptographic strength of a Boolean
function.  In particular, we prove that
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(i)] if $f$, a Boolean function on $V_{n}$,
	satisfies the propagation criterion with respect to
	all but a subset $\Re$ of vectors in $V_{n}$,
	then the nonlinearity of $f$ satisfies
	$N_{f}\geq 2^{n-1}-2^{\frac{1}{2}(n+t)-1}$,
	where $t$ is the rank of $\Re$, and
\item[(ii)] When $|\Re| > 2$, the nonzero vectors in $\Re$
	are linearly dependent.
\end{enumerate}
Furthermore we show that
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(iii)] if $|\Re| = 2$ then $n$ must be odd,
	the nonlinearity of $f$ satisfies
	$N_{f}=2^{n-1}-2^{\frac{1}{2}(n-1)}$,
	and the nonzero vector in $\Re$
	must be a linear structure of $f$.
\item[(iv)] there exists no function on $V_n$
	 such that $|\Re| = 3$.
\item[(v)] if $|\Re| = 4$ then $n$ must be even,
	the nonlinearity of $f$ satisfies
	$N_{f}=2^{n-1}-2^{\frac{1}{2}n}$,
	and the nonzero vectors in $\Re$
	must be linear structures of $f$.
\item[(vi)] if $|\Re| = 5$ then $n$ must be odd,
	the nonlinearity of $f$ is
	$N_{f} = 2^{n-1}-2^{\frac{1}{2}(n-1)}$,
	the four nonzero vectors in $\Re$,
	denoted by
	$\beta_{1}$, $\beta_{2}$, $\beta_{3}$ and $\beta_{4}$, 
	are related by the equation 
	$\beta_{1}\oplus \beta_{2}\oplus \beta_{3}\oplus \beta_{4}=0$,
	and {\em none\/} of the four vectors is
	a linear structure of $f$. 
\item[(vii)] there exists no function on $V_n$
	 such that $|\Re| = 6$.
\end{enumerate}
We also discuss the structures of functions with $|\Re| = 2,4,5$.
In particular we show that these functions have close
relationships with bent functions, and can be easily
constructed from the latter.

<H1>Legal issues</H1>
<P>For detailed information on PGP(tm) licensing, distribution,
copyrights, patents, trademarks, liability limitations, and export
controls, see the <A HREF="../pgpdoc2/legal_issues.html">"Legal Issues"</A>
section in the <A HREF="../pgpdoc2/pgpdoc2.html">"PGP User's Guide, Volume II: Special
  Topics"</A>.
<P>PGP uses a public key algorithm claimed by U.S. patent #4,405,829.
The exclusive licensing rights to this patent are held by a company
called Public Key Partners (PKP), and you may be infringing the patent
if you use PGP in the USA without a license.  These issues are
detailed in the Volume II manual, and in the RSAREF license that comes
with the freeware version of PGP.  PKP has licensed others
to practice the patent, including a company known as ViaCrypt, in
Phoenix, Arizona.  ViaCrypt sells a fully licensed version of
PGP.  ViaCrypt may be reached at 602-944-0773.
<P>PGP is "guerrilla" freeware, and I don't mind if you distribute it
widely.  Just don't ask me to send you a copy.  Instead, you can look
for it yourself on many BBS systems and a number of Internet FTP
sites.  But before you distribute PGP, it is essential that you
understand the U.S. export controls on encryption software.

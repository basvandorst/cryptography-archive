Subject: RIPEM / RIPEM Mac compatibility


It is a design goal for RIPEM to be able to exchange messages well
with other PEM-compliant applications including RIPEM Mac, TIS/PEM,
TechMail (which I don't have), TIPEM-based applications, etc.

There is the question of what a user should do who wants not only
message interoperability, but also for different applications to be
able to make use of the same keypair.  I think the right way to do
this is to go with an interoperable "user info" which can be exported
from one application, such as TIS/PEM, and imported into another, such
as RIPEM.  This way a user can move their personal information around.
The PKCS developers are working on such an object (which is really a
bag containing an encrypted private key, a public key, etc.).

I don't think different applications can maintain the ability to cut
information from one internal database file and paste it into the
internal files of another application, since different applications
choose different formats and need to change them from release to
release.  This is even true of RIPEM and RIPEM Mac.  As RIPEM grows,
there is no assurance that the developers of RIPEM Mac will make its
internal database formats change accordingly.

Therefor, I hope I can provide more information soon on the upcoming
"user info export format" as being developed by the PKCS committees as
a way of allowing different applications to share private keys and
other user info.

That's a good description of the issue.

Ultimately that's accurate, but for the short term (probably the next year)
it would be helpful to have a "quick and dirty", perhaps as a stand-alone,
that would take a Mac Ripem private and public key file, uploaded or pasted
via an editor into UNIX files, perhaps limited to one's own keys but
including all certificates (easy to do since they're editable ASCII text),
and "do the right thing" to get them into RIPEM (UNIX) format. One could
require that the user have the same key file password on the UNIX side as
the Mac side to make life easy. My guess is that Mac owners won't mind (in
fact might prefer) generating their private/public key pair on the Mac
rather than on a Unix machine they might also use, so it wouldn't be
necessary to go the other way with the quick and dirty.

In addition you may wish to improve the RIPEM (Unix) file structure, to more
fully reflect the information transmitted in PEM certificates. Ripem Mac
currently carries all the key info--serial number, expiration date, full PEM
path heirarchy (CN, OU, etc), all in human readable form in its file
structure. RIPEM (Unix) could with great profit do the same thing.

My guess is that this will continue to move at the present glacial pace.

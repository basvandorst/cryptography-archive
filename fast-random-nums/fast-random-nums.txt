The generator you mention is of the form X[n] = X[n-c] OP X[n-d],
with OP = Xor.  If there exist a function f, mapping the range of
the generator to (0,1), such that f(x OP y) = f(x) Xor f(y)
        d   c
and if x + x + 1 is a primitive trinomial Mod 2, then the period of
                  d
the generator is 2 - 1.  This is of course the case with OP = Xor or
OP = Add with f(x) = odd(x), but also (eg.) with x OP y = x Xor Perm(y)
and f(x) = Bitcount(x), where Perm is any bitpermutation (eg. Rotate left).

I rather like the plain OP = Xor even though it may require a larger state
to achieve the same level of randomness as other generators, as i am more
comfortable that i know its weaknesses and i like its speed.
In my experience, the most sensitive statistical test for this type of
generator (plain Xor) is the Coupon Collectors test, in my implementation
collecting 8 bit coupons.
For trinomials with c smaller than 3 - 7 or so, the most sensitive test
gather the bits of each coupon as one bit (in the same position) from 8
consecutive numbers in the generated stream, otherwise taking all 8 bits
from the same number is more efficient (in CPUtime).

               250   103
The trinomial x   + x   + 1 (which is used in r250) was adequate in 1981,
i suppose.  However, in 1993 an efficient implementation of the test
mensioned above can prove nonrandomness beyond doubt in less than 3 hours
of CPU on a HP9000/730.  This means that you can't draw more than about
2e9 numbers from it and still be safe.  An efficient implementation can
generate that many numbers in 7 minutes of CPU.

To determine what it takes to be adequate on a HP/730, we have to make some
assumptions about the use of the PRNG.  Probably the most demanding use of
a PRNG is in simulation.  If we want to allow a simulation running for a
month and if the simulation spends 5% of its time on generation of raw
equidistributed numbers (a conservative estimate, it probably spends less),
then the generator gets 1.296e11 uS.  An efficent implementation (a macro
doling out numbers from a buffer, refilled by a routine generating d numbers
at a time) take 0.2 uS per number, so this correspond to a production of
6.48e11 random numbers.  To safely draw that many numbers from a generator
of this type, i estimate that a trinomial of degree 763 is required (but
possibly as little as 630 may be enough(*)).

To get adequate quality 10 years from now on a comparable machine (last
years hottest WS), assuming a growth in CPU power no greater than 50% per
year, my estimate is that a trinomial of degree 1300 is required, but
possibly as little as 1020 is enough).

                       1279   418
In my own PRNG, i use x    + x   + 1.

(*)  In the model i use, i am extrapolating beyond the data points i have.
These sag slightly below the fitted curve in the middle and vice versa for
the extremes, so i am probably underestimating the quality provided by
trinomials of large degrees.

           ^^^^^^^^^^^^----should be odd(Bitcount)

The idea is simply that f(X[n]) is a bitstream such that
                                                     d
f(X[n]) = f(X[n-c]) Xor f(X[n-d]), which has period 2 - 1.
Therefore X[n] must have a period at least as long.

I was just trying to generalize and tripped over my feet.

Which tests to use should depend on your knowledge.  If one is testing
that the output of a counter is adequately random, looking at the
relative frequencies of overlapping bytes will be an excellent way
of testing.  But if a pseudo-random number generator is used, this
can be totally useless.  For example, suppose that one is using
the word Tausworthe generaor

		x[n] = x[n-460] ^ x[n-607]

and seed it with 607 truly random words, it would pass any such test.

Extracting the S-Tools archive
------------------------------
S-Tools version 3.00 is supplied in the archive file S-TOOLS.ZIP. The file
S-TOOLS.SIG is a PGP signature of this file that you can use to check its
integrity if you so wish. To do this requires my public key which you can
get by either contacting me personally or fingering <asb@vulcan.nexor.co.uk>
You will need a version of PGP that can handle 2048 bit keys in order to
successfully check the signature.  MIT version 2.6.2 or greater is
suitable for this purpose.

As an added bonus, creating an uncompressed zip and then compressing it as
one file allows PKZIP to take advantage of redundancies in all the archive
files and hence you get a smaller overall distribution zip size.


Installing S-Tools
------------------
There is no special installation procedure for S-Tools.  Simply create a
directory for it and unzip the above mentioned S-TOOLS.ZIP file into this
new directory.  Then all you need to do is use the Windows program manager
to create a new program group for S-Tools and then add the ST-BMP.EXE,
ST-FDD.EXE, ST-WAV.EXE and S-TOOLS.HLP files to it.  Dead simple, one day I
might get around to writing one of those blue-screen setup type programs to
make it seem even easier :-)

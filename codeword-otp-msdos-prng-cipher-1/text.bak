Cryptology.

Cryptology (from the Greek kryptos "hidden," and logos, "word"), the science
dealing with disguised or secret communications, is concerned with the 
methods and devices employed to camouflage communications (or even their
existence), and to penetrate such communications contrived by others.
Cryptology today plays a major role in governmental and military affairs of
nations and a lesser role in banking, industry, and commerce.  Cryptology
has also played a part in the deciphering of lost languages, and even in
attempts to establish authorship of works, such as Shakespear's plays.
Although cryptology was concerned initially with secrecy of written messages,
its principles apply not only to enciphered or encoded messages (cryptograms)
but also to enciphered speech, enciphered facsimile, and enciphered television
transmissions.

Cryptology embraces the twin or complementary sciences of signal security and
signal intelligence.  Signal security is concerned with all the methods of
protecting one's own signals against interception and reading or utilization
by unauthorized persons (generally called "the enemy").  Signal intelligence
comprises all the methods employed in acquiring information or intelligence
by intercepting and solving the enemy's cryptosignals or nullifying his signal
security so the signals or information derived from them can be used against
him.

There are three important aspects to signal security.  Physical and personnel
security assures that physical arrangements, facilities and procedures for
safeguarding cryptomaterials (codes, ciphers, key lists, cipher machines),
are adequate and that personnel using codes and ciphers are trustworthy.
Transmission security embraces the means, methods, and procedures for assuring
that no information useful to the enemy is inadvertently disclosed either by 
indiscretions of operators or by equipment malfunctions.  Cryptosecurity deals
with the technical adequacy of the cryptography or cryptosystems employed.

Cryptography.

Cryptography (from the Greek kryptos, "hidden," and graphein, "to write")
deals with the methods involved in preparing cryptograms -- messages or
writings intended to be incomprehensible to all except those who legitimately
possess the means to reproduce the original plaintext.  Conversion of a
plaintext message into a cryptogram is called encrypting (or, more specific-
ally, enciphering or encoding); reconverting the cryptogram back into its
intelligible form, when done by a lelgitimate or authorized communicator, is
called decryption (specifically, deciphering or decoding).  Although in theory
no sharp line of demarcation can be drawn between code systems and cipher
systems, in modern practice the technical differences between them are
sufficiently marked to warrant their being treated separately.

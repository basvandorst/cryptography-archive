The 1/24/94 Washington Post announced the opening of the NSA crypto
museum.  The Post said it had actually been open to the public for a
little while but they didn't initially announce the opening to the press
for fear of their people's photographs being published.

The museum covers up to about 1974, with some exceptions like a 1983
Cray.  They have items such as Enigma machines and the bugged carved
plaque given to the US embassy.

It's in Fort Meade, Maryland: East on MD-32 from I-295, "behind the
Shell station", in a former motel.  9-3 m-f.

The front page of today's Washington Post (Monday, Jan 24)
has an article about the NSA's (relatively) new museum
located behind a Shell station in a defunct motel surrounded
by a chain-link fence just off the Baltimore-Washington Parkway.

Apparently, the museum "held the first opening in July and
didn't tell the public.  It held a second ribbon-cutting
last month for the public but didn't tell the press."  It's
open 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Mon-Fri.  Call 301-688-5849

The article is mostly fluff, but worth reading.

Yes.  It is an interesting museum. I stopped by there a month or so back
and checked it out. While it is small, it has lots of machines with a
history. Even some old books dating back to the 1500s. The highlight of the
museum (IMO) is a real working Enigma machine.

Actually it isn't exactly a FAQ, but it's interesting.

Q: Say what?  There is a NSA museum?
A: Yes.  The National Cryptologic Museum opened in December,
   and is located on Colony 7 Road, off Route 32 just East of
   the Baltimore-Washington Parkway.
   Hours are 9 AM - 3 PM, Monday - Friday.  Other hours by 
   appointment.  The phone number is (301) 688-5849

The museum was mentioned in a local paper (Laurel Leader) last
Thursday.  I'll probably visit it on Monday.  The article in the
paper mentions that the exhibit contains declassified cryptologic
material such as the german Enigma machine.  The repository also
includes a fascinating rare-book collection on cryptology that dates
back to the 16th century.  "We have the first edition of the second
book ever published on the subject," [curator Earl] Coates announced
proudly, "and the second edition of the first book ever published on
the subject."  The latter, called Opus Novym, was written by Jacopo
Silvestri, a citizen of Florence, Italy.

I dropped in at the NSA's crypt museum briefly the other day.  I've
seen pictures published of most of the crypto stuff there, in Kahn's
books, mostly.  It's essentially one large room, probably a converted
dining room from an old motel. Here's what I saw:

1) A display case of the oldest books on crypto they had in the
NSA libraries, mid 1500s to mid 1800s. You could see enough to
appreciate the age of the typography, but that's about it.

2) radio detection and interception stuff from WW I or II.

3) some photos and a few relics concerning NSA computers, including
what looked like a decommissioned Cray 1 CPU. It looked like a real
one with a couple of panels replaced by plexiglass to show the
innards, but it may have been a detailed product mockup.

4) enemy crypto machines: several German models, a WW II Russian
machine, and some Japanese stuff, including a fragment of a Purple
machine from the ruins of Japan's Berlin embassy.

The high point was probably the *working* Enigma machine they had on
display. You could change the rotor settings, type out messages, and
watch the encrypted characters light up. More fun than my Royal
typewriter, and about the same size.

The biggest advantage of *seeing* the stuff rather than looking at
photos is that I got a better idea of size for these things. Otherwise
the museum didn't do much to enhance my technical understanding. They
are planning to open expanded exhibits this summer that include
interactive displays.

I was also the zillionth person to ask "Why don't you have a gift shop
or book store or something?" They're looking into it.

I visited the National Cryptologic Museum the other day.  As others have
said, it's kinda small, but pretty neat.  Well worth an hour or so if
you're in the DC/Baltimore area (9:00 AM to 3:00 PM, weekdays).  Not
much technical material, and little that I haven't seen in pictures here
and there, but very interesting to see the machines all together there.

It's easy to find: the exit (Route 32 East off Route 295 Baltimore
Washington parkway) has a little brown "National Cryptologic Museum"
sign, and I think there are about five more of those signs in the mile
or so of driving after that.  It is, indeed, right behind the Shell
station at the exit.  It's about 10 minutes away from Baltimore airport.

It's one big room with a bunch of exhibits and some staff to answer
questions.  In approximately chronological order, these are the
exhibits I recall:

Assorted old crypto books, including Trithemius's Polygrafica
19th-century Jefferson cipher-disk machine
American Civil war cipher disks, miscellany
World War I radio monitoring station
Yardley exhibit: books, deciphered diplomatic correspondence 

American SIGABA machine
British TYPEX machine with SIGABA compatibility box
Japanese Coral machine
Japanese Purple machine fragment (one of 3 in existence)
German Enigma machines
  Army (3-rotor)
  Air Force (3-rotor)
  Naval (4-rotor)
  Commercial machine (4-rotor, no plugboard), several models
  Naval U-boat model (4-rotor with printer)
  A couple of disassembled units/components and spare rotors
  Plus:  a 3-rotor machine for hands-on use (neat!)
German Lorenz SZ-40/42 ("Tunny") machine
German Siemens T-52 Geheimschreiber ("Sturgeon") machine
Soviet copy of an electro-mechanical Hagelin machine
Photos of U.S. Bombes at OP-20G, but no pieces

Soviet exhibit: 1960-vintage spy radio, photos from KGB museum (no crypto)
Exhibit on U.S.S. Liberty (NSA monitoring ship accidentally attacked)
Exhibit on early NSA computer technology: tape drive from IBM Harvest, 
  assorted photos, plus a 1960-vintage analog (!) computer
Cray X-MP24 with windows to see the insides
Exhibit on NSA's IC fabrication lab
Plus a handful of picture/story plaques on notables in the field:
  (e.g., Safford, Friedman, Rejewski & crew)

The Museum will be adding 1200 square feet in May/June, including a
bunch of new hands-on exhibits.  It wasn't clear to me whether these
would be mostly real equipment or computer-generated demonstrations,
though one exhibit will be a pair of STU-IIs.  There's also a library
available on request "to serious researchers".

There was essentially nothing cryptologic post-WWII, but I was surprised
to see what seems like a current-day treatment of the IC fabrication
facilities.  The old crypto books are in amazingly good condition: they
look like ordinary (if somewhat aged) books except that they're mostly
in Latin.  Nothing about Bletchley, nothing about Hagelin (except the
copied Soviet machine)--the non-U.S. stuff is almost all from various
WWII enemies.  I also thought the exhibit on the IBM Harvest don't
really do it justice--I hope they'll add more on that in the future.

It was a surprise to me how BIG some of the machines are.  They're
beautiful examples of mechanical engineering, but many don't even look
suitcase-portable--and they must be pretty heavy, too.  The SIGABA
looked small enough for one strong person to move, but pretty much all
the others (except Enigmas) looked like hand-truck material.  Clearly,
the Enigma's portability was a big advantage operationally, and made up
for a good deal of inconvenience in actual use (which worked best with
three operators: one to read the message, one to press the keys, and one
to record the lights as they light up).

The staff was very friendly: one gentleman helped me use the Enigma,
showed me how to set the wheels and plugboard, etc.  It's a lot
different to actually use a real one than just to know how it works.
We had a nice chat about how the operators' bad habits and mistakes
made the thing much more breakable--and having played with the
machine, it's a lot easier to see how those habits came about.  He
also gave me a look at an M-209 machine that wasn't yet on exhibit.

Recommended.

My dad and I also visited the museum last week. Olin's description was
pretty complete so I won't duplicate what he wrote.

My personal favorite among the exhibits was the Enigma display,
especially the working, hands-on machine. Having read quite a bit
about this machine I had no trouble enciphering and deciphering a
message on the first try ("HELLO"). They even provide a pad and pencil
for your convenience!

I knew that the Germans had separate Enigma models for each military
branch, but I hadn't known about the special printing unit for use on
U-boats. Ordinarily it took three operators to run an Enigma machine:
one to read off the plain/cipher message, one to type it in, and one
to write down the cipher/plain message. (The exhibit included a
photograph of three German soldiers operating one.) This is
impractical in the close quarters of a submarine, so a unit with a
built-in tape printer was designed to allow operation by a single
person, who was presumably also the radio operator.

Right. Do *not* take the "NSA Employees Only" exit from the southbound
BW parkway, even though it seems to be on the opposite side of the
freeway from Rt 32 west. We did that and ended up lost (but not shot!)

|> Soviet exhibit: 1960-vintage spy radio, photos from KGB museum (no crypto)

The spy radio looked very much like a small homebuilt amateur radio
station from that era. I found it interesting that they always used
components of local origin, with labels written in the local language
(e.g., this particular transmitter used metal-cased 6L6 tubes, and was
labeled in English.)

|> Exhibit on U.S.S. Liberty (NSA monitoring ship accidentally attacked)

Including the large US flag that flew during the attack. I could easily
see how the Israelis might have mistaken it for an Egyptian flag...NOT!

I assume this was the room off to the side of the entrance hallway,
which was roped off at the time I was there. Peering through the
doorway to the left rear of the room I saw a very familar looking
PDP-11/70, complete with freestanding RP-06 style drives, Dectape,
etc. To the right of the PDP-11 was a series of desk positions with
telephones that appeared to be various models of the STU-III. From a
distance I think I recognized the Motorola and GE units, which I've
examined before.  I was momentarily surprised to think that they would
allow the public to handle Controlled Cryptographic Items.  I presume
that they are actually either Type III (DES) units or perhaps have had
all cryptography removed - after all, if you're just trying to
demonstrate to the public what talking over the STU-III is like, all
you really need are the vocoders.

Right. Except for the Cray and the microelectronics facility exhibits,
the displays stopped at the end of WWII. Not too surprising.

Right again. I was amused to see the TELETYPE CORP name plates on many
of the machines. In their construction, they really did resemble the
mechanical teletype machines of the 50s and 60s, which I remember well
from my early days in ham radio.

However you may have noted that the US machines had many more rotors than
their German counterparts; I think I saw at least 5 rotors on most of the
US machines.

Definitely. Small but very interesting. I took a roll of photos that are
currently being processed. If I can find a scanner when I get them back,
I'll put up some of the more interesting ones on the net.

The museum is only open weekdays.  It is near the intersection of
Maryland Route
32 and the Baltimore-Washington Parkway.  Exit the parkway onto 32 east
and follow
the signs.  Left toward the Shell station and along a narrow road that
leads
to what was the Colony 7 Motel.  It is small, but interesting.  Someone
else
will correct me if I am wrong about the weekdays thing.

The NCM is located just east of the BWI Parkway, north of the RT32
exit. This is roughly midway between DC and Baltimore. It is open
?10:00 am? until 3:00pm M-F, but Saturday hours may be available later
in the summer - tel 301 688 5849. Admission is free. There are
lots of signs, and an access road designed to discourage you.....

At present, the lobby has a fascinating D-Day photo exhibit. It includes
copies of documents allocating the deception troops that formed the
First US Army Group under Patton, pictures of the Group's famous rubber
tanks and jeeps, maps of Fortitude, and even a shot of Patton where he
was not supposed to be.....

In the main museum, several very old, very rare, books are on display.
(I'm rather surprised they are exposed to so much light, even within
their protective enclosures.)

There are a few items from the Civil war and Black Chamber eras, but as
befits NSA, most of the material is more recent. William Friedman is
well represented.

The Enigma area has several models, including two 4-rotor naval models.
One three-rotor machine is exposed and in running order; you are
invited to "give it a try" and record the results. The problems faced
in the field soon became obvious, as the unit had a burnt-old lamp in
the "V" position. (If there is a 'lamp-test' switch -- locating same
requires some German ;-)

In addition, there is a Sigaba, a Typex, a Tunny and a Sturgeon.  The
only fragment of a Purple machine is from the Japanese Embassy in
Berlin.

In many ways, the decisions behind what is _missing_ from the exhibits
are as intriguing as what is there. The USS Liberty has a large
memorial exhibit (it even admits the losses of NSA employees on board);
but the Pueblo is not mentioned at all. The KGB panel shows a Great
Seal replica, but not a word about the infamous Selectric typewriters.
The Zimmerman telegram is also absent. Contemplating these, one gets a
feel for the vast internal struggles the NSA must grapple with to have
a public exhibit at all.

There are several excellent handouts. One is on D-Day and another covers
Bombes. Both have suggested reading lists. There is already work under
way to expand into an adjacent room; I noticed a KY-71 and other
contemporary equipment in the back of that area.

If you have the hour or two needed, and are in the area, the Museum is
a worthwhile stop. It's rather doubtful, however, that any
non-crypto-enthused family members will share your interest.

The following story about the NSA museum appeared in the Washington
Post some months ago.....
 
 
 
By KEN RINGLE  WASHINGTON POST
 
 
 
   WASHINGTON--In the shadowy world of U.S. intelligence agencies, the
National Security Agency has always been the most clandestine.
 
   About 20,000 people work at the mirror-windowed complex at Ft. Meade
between Baltimore and Washington, but until 1989 there wasn't even a sign
in front of the buildings. The 1952 executive order that created the
agency was itself classified. For years it was a federal crime even to
say it existed.
 
   Therefore, as might be expected, when the *NSA* opened its own *museum*
recently, it did things a little differently. It held the first opening
in July and didn't tell the public. It held a second ribbon-cutting in
December for the public but didn't tell the press.
 
   When a reporter heard of the *museum* recently from a source close to
the *NSA,* he was able to locate it only after an extended series of calls
to the agency.
 
   "People tend to be a bit sensitive around here," said Stephen J.
McAnallen, a surprisingly good-natured man finally located under the
oxymoronic title of *NSA* public affairs officer. "It sort of comes with
the territory."
 
   With McAnallen's help, the National Cryptologic *Museum* was ultimately
discovered in a defunct motel at the end of a crumbling road behind a
Shell gas station just off Route 32 from the Baltimore-Washington
Parkway. It would be a highly anonymous location were it not surrounded
by a high chain-link fence with barbed wire on top.
 
   The *museum* is the latest step in the gradual demythologizing of the
agency--a process former director and until recently Defense
Secretary-designate Bobby Ray Inman started more than 10 years ago, said
David A. Hatch, 51, an *NSA* historian waiting inside.
 
   "Some fairly detailed books and articles" about the long-secret agency
had appeared by then and, although many in the agency remain almost
pathological in their passion for anonymity, "people have discovered the
world won't crumble if the words "cryptology' or "sigint' appear in
print," he said.
 
   Sigint--intelligence gleaned from the interception and decryption of
government and military signals--is, of course, what *NSA* is all about.
And, as exhibits in what once was the motel's bar indicate, its origins
are as old as coded writings and invisible ink.
 
   The *museum* displays two books on cryptography dating from the 16th
Century, as well as a small but elegant wooden cipher machine, found in
West Virginia and dating from around 1800, that may have originated in
the fertile mind of Thomas Jefferson.
 
   Other exhibits show how sigint multiplied during the Civil War, when
Union and Confederate signal corpsmen read each other's wigwagged
troop-movement signals and tapped each other's telegraph lines.
 
   But the bulk of the *museum* is devoted to sigint's boom years--those
between World War I and 1974, when publication of F. W. Winterbotham's
book "The Ultra Secret" finally disclosed the greatest and most closely
held secret of World War II.
 
   An improbable combination of Polish foresight, British genius,
American technology and German hubris permitted the Allied forces to read
German and Japanese radio signals for most of the war. It was so vital
that most historians now recognize it as the key ingredient in the Allied
victory, particularly at such crucial moments as the Battle of the
Atlantic against German U-boats; the Battle of Midway, which halted
Japan's advance in the Pacific; and the invasion of Normandy.
 
   At the heart of the code-breaking struggle was the storied Enigma
cipher machine, an ingenious electromechanical typewriter fitted with a
system of adjustable rotors designed to produce a cipher so complex it
would defy human solution.
 
   The Germans considered their Enigma-based codes unbreakable. And so
they might have been had not some Polish cryptographers managed to
reproduce an Enigma machine from documents sold to them by an embittered
German aristocrat whose fortunes had reduced him to a signal clerk.
 
   After the invasion of Poland, the replica Enigma was smuggled to
Britain, where British code-breakers managed to devise a pioneering
electronic computer called "the bombe," designed to exhaust and therefore
solve the mathematical possibilities of Enigma rotor settings. The rest
is, quite literally, history.
 
   *Museum* curator Earl J. Coates, 54, appears mildly miffed that *NSA's*
own bombe was loaned to the Smithsonian Institution's "Information Age"
exhibit before his own *museum* was up and running. The *NSA museum,*
however, is awash in Enigma machines--Luftwaffe Enigmas, U-boat Enigmas
and even an Enigma visitors can play with themselves.
 
   Also on display is the U.S. Sigma machine, the only cipher machine of
World War II whose codes were never broken.
 
   The National Cryptologic *Museum,* reached by exiting the
Baltimore-Washington Parkway at Route 32 and heading behind the Shell
station, is open from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Monday through Friday. Some at *NSA*
say you can reach it at 301-688-5849. Others at *NSA* deny that number
exists.

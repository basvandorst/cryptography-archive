     I am "the poster" referenced above and the statement is completely
false.  I suggested that people considering the purchase of one or more
copies of Dr. Denning's book also consider the ethical question of
financially enriching someone actively supporting the restriction of our
privacy.  I founded no organization, I made no call to arms, and I never
called for destruction of existing copies of her work.

     Mr. Sternlight's inability to distinguish between private, voluntary
acts and government force calls into question his reading comprehension
and his integrity.

I don't think that THAT is the case.  I believe that the Skipjack
algorithm is implemented in the chip design, and that the "unprogrammed"
chips are returned to Myko- for 'programming' with unit keys.  I say this
because Myko- designed the chip layout, and VLSI only manufactures them.

An unprogrammed chip is a Clipper Chip without a unit key.
A  programmed chip is a Clipper Chip that the Government wants you to use.

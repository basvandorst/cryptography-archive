Honestly, I don't know. The two page blurb which I received and
typed in a while back makes no mention of this. Of course, some
serial line protocols allow quoting and escaping, and clipper
might do the same thing for the LEF. If clipper can truly
do 16Mb/s and voice only requires 4800 baud, that's plenty of
room between the 4800 baud you need, and the 14.4k baud
that decent modems achieve now for playing games. In fact,
you could encrypt voice at 9600 baud, and use the balance
of the channel for "out of band" signalling.

Really? I'm completely ignorant of an RSA chip that I could
grab today and use to build something Clipper-like. Can you
supply us with the names of manufacturers who are willing
to sell these 4800 baud RSA chips in small quantaties? 
Like, lots of 100? 

It's beyond my technical expertise, but if any RSA chip can
be convinced to carry voice right now, I don't know why 
astute readers on this group or on the cyperpunks mailing
list haven't already published a circuit diagram.

I know I could write the firmware for such a device, and I'm
just a fly on the wall.

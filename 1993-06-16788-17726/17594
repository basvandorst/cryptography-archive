A good source, as close to the horse's mouth as Joe Public will get, is 
Dr R.V.Jones book 'Most Secret War' for those interested in scientific 
intelligence, deception and othe counter-measures, rather than cryptography, 
per se, it is excellent. Dr Jones's book is the story of British Scientific 
Intelligence 1939-45. His personal account of the handling of Enigma 
intercepts prior to the Coventry raid is c. page 200.

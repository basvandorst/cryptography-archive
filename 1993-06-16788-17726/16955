Today I went to the library to read the Denning book, they didn't have
it but instead I got Modern Cryptology a tutorial by Gilles Brassard,
Springer-Verlag, #325 of Lecture Notes in Computer Science. (1988)

It is a great book with 90 pages of easy-to-read text and a Bibliography
of 17 pages.

Brassard state that while RSA has not been proved to be as hard as factoring,
the Blum-Goldwasser probabilistic encryption scheme has been.
"Even should factoring be genuinely hard, breaking RSA is not known to
be equally hard." pg 30.

Thus Blum-Goldwasser ought to be considered more secure than RSA.
It might be faster too (when encrypting).

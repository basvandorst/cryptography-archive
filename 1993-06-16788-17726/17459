I am planning to use this algorithm for sending stuff through to
a friend of mine:

U(n+1)=pUn(1-Un) where p is near 4, and Un is a number between
0+ and 1. U(n+1) is the output of the function.

From what I know, this will give me a chaotic, nonrepeatable solution
that when normalized between 0 and 255 and XORed with data, will
be decent for encryption.  Am I deluding myself?  What is this algorithm's
main weakness?

Thanks in advance.

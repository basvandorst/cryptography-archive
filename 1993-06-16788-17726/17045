I consider all of this discussion of Dorothy Denning very distasteful,
reflecting great discredit on this forum.  Some posters have suggested 
that her unpopular views be punished with a boycott, others have suggested 
that she is incompetent to discuss politics, and another has suggested 
that most of her research has been politicaly correct and hence she 
should be gently nudged back into the correct line of thought.

Why does anything about her (as opposed to what she writes) matter to
the net?  How presumptuous for some nettie to try to nudge her research
career this way or that way because of his opinion of her politics!

If her ideas excite comment, please let that comment be addressed to the
ideas, and not to the person.

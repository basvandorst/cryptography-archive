Where do you get the idea that you can stop an ``active eavesdropper'' 
simply by reading half-keys out loud? What if he has been impersonating 
the other guy all along, including meeting you in person, reading 
half-keys over the phone to you, and all these other ``security'' 
procedures? What if the person you think you're talking to doesn't even 
exist? What if everyone you'd ever met was secretly working for the CIA?

No form of cryptography can defeat God. Whoever controls your eyes, your 
ears, is God. This is not a disadvantage of cryptography; it is the 
glory of God. Don't sweat it.

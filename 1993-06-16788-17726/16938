   Some time ago I used the encryption facility of FastBack to back up my
hard drives, then promptly forgot the password (very unlike me!).  After
spending a few hours with debug, I was able to find the subroutine that
(constantly, repeatedly) verifies that the password is valid and replace
it with a two-line subroutine that simply returned a 0, indicating a
valid password.  The people at Fifth Generation said they'd be glad to
decrypt it for me, but it would take weeks, etc., so I took my own tack.
This may or may not work for you; I'm not familiar with the internals of
PFS Write; but they probably use a similar mechanism.  Also, this has the
disadvantage of not allowing you to recover the password, but the advantage
that you become able to decrypt _any_ file encrypted by PFS Write, should
you find and nullify the mechanism.
   Epilogue: a friend with an earlier version of FastBack took the disks
and found that it, without the encryption feature in it, would just take
and restore the disks, no questions asked.  *sigh*

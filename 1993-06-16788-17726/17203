There a a whole bunch of engineering issues not addressed by the Crippler
proposal, such as low power sleep modes and the use of firmware space
in a single chip product instead of a dedicated crypto chip.  Hundreds
of specific problems like that which will never be solved as long as
the government monopolizes the standard.

But besides that, I was wondering when laptop manufacturers who 
build in cellular modems into their products will discover the
obvious security hole they are leaving: what if I log onto my
mainframe via unencrypted cellular fax?  The phone number is broadcast
in the clear, as is my username, password, and a neat demonstation
of how to use the system.  If their is a better-case scenario for
a hacker, I can't imagine what it could be!

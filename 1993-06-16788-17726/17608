How about a reply of :

  "We do not trust you to limit your use of this key to the stated
  purpose, however, we are concerned that your request may be legitimate.
  Please send us the clipper cyphertext via high speed data link, 
  and we will decrypt it if we get a warrant.  If the text contains
  any information of use for fighting terrorism or whatever, we 
  will give it out.  If it is commercial traffic, we will notify
  the transmitter and reciepient that the US government has, subject
  to warrant and under French request, decyphered your traffic."

None of this should be taken as a concession by myself that escrowed
key cryptography is reasonable, however, the situation of foreign
law enforcement access could be handled without compromising commercial
traffic (of course, this would require that other countries trust the 
US...or else, they could always buy crypto systems from our foreign 
competitors).

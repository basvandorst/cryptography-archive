The DNS can do almost all of what you propose, either using a new RR type,
or using specially formatted TXT RRs.  The hierarchy of co-operating but
autonomous servers is already deployed.

The format could be something like:
    username.mailingdomain. PUBKEY keytype,keyvalue
or:
    username.mailingdomain. TXT "PUBKEY keytype,keyvalue"

Obviously, the details need a lot of thought.

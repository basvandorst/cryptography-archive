Nowdays, the difference between hardware and software is kind of fuzzy.
For a secure voice unit, with data rates limited to 64 Kb/sec or so,
just about any DSP type processor could keep up easily with any
reasonable block-type cypher.  Note that DSPs are optimized for bit
shuffling operations.

The problem is cost.  The EEPROMs and such the we would need to make the
unit programmble might very well cost more than the processor and its
built-in program.

So we put in a socket.  Want a new algorithm?  Buy a new chip for $30 or
so.

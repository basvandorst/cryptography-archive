At the risk of inviting many flames, I have this question for each
person who opposes the Clipper proposal:

- For whom did you vote last November?

This is sort of rhetorical, but not entirely.  There seems to be an
assumption that the NSA and the NIST are making decisions on their
own.  Realize that ultimately both agencies must do whatever Congress
tells them, and that ultimately Congress does what voters tell it.  So,
who is *really* responsible for the Clipper proposal?

And knowing what you now do about Clipper:

- In what way will what you know about Clipper affect for whom who you
  will vote the next time around?

     As disingenuous and offensive as your comparison of my suggested
voluntary action to Hitler's book burnings?

     I suggested that people factor in Dr. Denning's support for
intrusive technology and legislation when evaluating the costs and
benefits of her book.  How does this in any way go beyond personal
action?  Have I used force?  Have I called for the use of force (either
government or private)?

     I called for consideration of all facets of the issue.  I have no
ethical problem in supporting a voluntary boycott, but I don't find
Dr. Denning's potential impact important enough to actively organize
one at this time.

     As for words failing you, one can only hope.

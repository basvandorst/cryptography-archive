And, another thread is revived. I welcome it, but will anything change?

Nope, the S/N ratio goes up and down, but still - it's not good.

Oh, please - no. Make the naming simple, and try to avoid a suffix that
really contradicts the `sci' prefix. A lot of people are somewhat touchy
about this.

Or, it's a few months since we had a quiet period...

I agree, and I'd be happy to se a moderated sci.crypt.research appear.
An unmoderated group would probably help somewhat, but it's very hard
to guess the S/N ratio for a group like that.

The sci.crypt group should be able to take what's rejected in the
research group, but shouldn't really have a charter that accepts
to much "noise."  However, some political issues should be relevant
foir the community. But the "old" sci.crypt group should be there
mainly for technical/scientific discussions.

I like the idea of a split, but I fear that this proposal will
end the same way previous attempts have ended.

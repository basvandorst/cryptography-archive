Time delay isn't important when a courier carrying a briefcase is actually
delivering a one-time pad.  A single briefcase can hold a large number of
optical disks, or high density magnetic tapes.  One could transmit a LOT
of secure data (many gigabytes) using the one-time pads carried by 
a single courier on a single trip.

Encrypted communications can be sent in realtime, assuming the one-time
pad has already been delivered.  I'd guess that the best way to avoid
compromising the pad (assuming a single bad courier) would be to XOR
the actual pad with yet another one or two pads delivered by other agents
on other occasions, and using the resulting combination so that a single
compromised delivery (actually, n-1 deliveries) won't compromise the
message.

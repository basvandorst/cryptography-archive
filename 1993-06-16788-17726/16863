Both Ripem and TISPEM are now available. Ripem Mac, in particular, is
designed to be interoperable with TISPEM. Thus we may expect many non-PGP
keys to be posted as well.  Given the institutional factors involved in
each, it is by no means certain that this will result in PGP "taking off".
Right now it has been the only "free" game in town for some, and
particularly for non-U.S. users. That will change.

At least for Ripem, using the key server is much simpler. One can, if one
wishes, access all keys and keep them, checking for changes, etc.

Both MacRipem (probably Ripem real soon now) and TISPEM involve
certification and certification authorities. That adds additional confidence
that PGP lacks, since what passes for certification is entirely ad hoc
there.

This is not an attack on PGP, but an observation that things are more
complex than some seem to think.

Though PGP has many fans, since non-commercial versions (developmental betas
that work fine) are now also freely available (at least in the U.S.) for
Ripem, Ripem Mac, and TISPEM, and since powerful institutional forces and
standards groups are behind them, it may be that a good analogy is that
between PGP and early home-brew PCs, vs. the alternatives and the early
Apple and IBM PCs.

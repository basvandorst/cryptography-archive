While some of us may disagree with a few of Professor Denning's
positions (I know I do), there is no doubt that she is a leading
cryptographer. Her textbook on crypto is getting a bit dated (1982),
but it is still one of the clearest introductions.

(The references above, in Mark Johnson's posting, are mostly in
"historical" cryptography--Kahn's "The Codebreakers," etc--and are not
what is generally called "modern cryptology." For that, see the
Proceedings of the "Crypto" conferences, the Denning book, Brassard,
and so on. These are usually found in good university libraries, or in
technical bookstores. I believe the Crypto FAQ, posted occasionally
here, mentions these books and journals.)

She has also been involved with the hacker community, and is described
in Bruce Sterling's "The Hacker Crackdown."

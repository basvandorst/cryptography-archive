IMPORTANCE NOTICE:

This thread is now officially over, as per the Codex of Usenet.  If
you will please turn to book 5, chapter 9, verse 13:

"The posting of an article containing a sentence of the form
'X belief is [like] the belief of (Nazis, Hitler)' is to Usenet
threads as EOF is to files and SIGKILL is to processes.  Do not
attempt further communication in the thread, as results will be
implementation-dependent and nonstandard in their return values."


This message has been brought to you by the Society of Concerned
Usenet Readers.

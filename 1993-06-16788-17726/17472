I've got a stupid-type question. I hope someone can explain it to me
without higher-order math, cuz it's been a few years since diffeq ;-{

If you have a long, NON-perfectly random number, and you are using it
as a OTP, is that really vulnerable to attack? My point is, to me, it
looks like there is a BIG middle ground between:

perfectly		inbetween	              perfectly		
predictable						random
ABCDABCDABCD ;}            ?                           ashjKaSG

Given that you only use a given digit once, what are the risks
of a given inbetween key?

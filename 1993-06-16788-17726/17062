    Let's see if I have this right.  We're discussing the morality of
organizing or proposing boycotts on sci.crypt, since one person suggested
that other people reconsider the purchase of a book written by a person who
favors a proposal written by other people to escrow cryptkeys in a cryptchip
to encode voice communication.

    Anybody care to discuss the use of kill files to eliminate articles
from people who espouse the proper method to discuss the ethics of posters
who disparage the familial lineage of the posters who debate the original
intent of the founding fathers when they created the process that defines
the structure of the government that gives rise to the campaign strategies
that impact voter's decisions to elect candidates who favor the restriction
of water rights to counties that grow a portion of the soy crop that goes
into the ink used to print the financial reports of the publisher that
produces the book written by the person who favors the proposal of the
other people to keep the keys used by the general people to encode their
telephone conversations?

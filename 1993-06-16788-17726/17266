: I cannot agree with that statement. The best public domain file compression
: program (according to my tests) is 'lha' and for compressed text with
: size of compressed data 600K I have measured entropy 7.998993/byte - 
: just 8-1e-3. Encrypted file of approx the same length, (my encryption program
: which is also posted here has been used) gives entropy 7.9997, which is
: 8-3e-4. It should be looked more on the difference from 8. On short files
: the differences are not so obvious. 

But Clipper never gets to see 600K blocks.  As far as I know, Clipper
encrypts short data blocks (8 bytes?), one at a time.  Clipper would
need to do a lot of computation and contain a lot of memory in order
to discover whether the data was compressed data, noisy audio data, or
whatever.  And it would need an unrealistic amount of data to do the
checking.  Also, it's easy for any encryption program to generate
output which looks decidedly nonrandom, at the cost of some expansion
of the ciphertext.  For example each ciphertext byte could be encoded
as an English word, and you could then compress the ciphertext; how
would you then be able to tell?

: Anyway, much better test for distinguishment of compressed and crypted file
: is chi-square test of occurencies of bytes (0-255), or also byte pairs.
: I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANY OUTPUT OF COMPRESSION PROGRAMS WHICH WOULD PASS

: THE OUTPUT OF MY (AND ANY STRONG) ENCRYPTION  PROGRAM PASSES THIS TEST.

That really isn't so.  A strong encryption program can easily be
written to _fail_ the pairs chi-square test.

We have won a round in the ATM litigation currently underway in the UK. The
Crown Prosecution Service has just dropped the charges against a lady who
was accused of theft after

(1)	A phantom withdrawal took place on a colleague's account while the
	colleague's ATM card was in her car

(2)	She had previously helped this colleague by getting money for
	her from an ATM and thus had once known the PIN for the card

Even Barclays Bank admits that 1 in 34,000 ATM transactions goes wrong; if
there are 3,000,000 transactions per day, this means over 32,000 bad
transactions a year in Britain alone.

The real number is probably a lot higher than this, as most banks' initial
response to a complaint is `our systems are infallible, so you must have been
ripped off by your family or friends'. This case shows that making such
accusations is not just wicked: it can cause very serious harm in the rare 
cases where the circumstances throw suspicion on an innocent individual. 

There is another case outstanding with somewhat similar circumstances, and
one documented miscarriage of justice (a teenager was convicted in 1985 of 
stealing 40 pounds from her father, and it then turned out that the bank 
had issued his account number to another person as well).

If this year's crop of two cases is typical, then during the twenty five 
years that ATMs have been in use, some fifty people may have had their lives 
ruined by them. The total worldwide is probably in the hundreds.

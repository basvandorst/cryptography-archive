Given that spooks are *very* prone to disseminating disinformation, then
there's also possibility 3: they *can* crack 128-bits, but not much higher,
so if they get the legal limit dropped to 64-bits people will incorrectly
assume that 128-bits is safe...

OK, the estimates of hardware capability that keep popping up on here make
this unlikely.  So maybe there's a back-door and they make the big fuss about
key-size so we think there isn't.

Hmm, while I'm feeling paranoid...  Several people have advanced the
hypothesis that PKP is an arm of the NSA and is tasked with making sure that
RSA is never used in combination with a strong encryption scheme.  If we
assume this to be true (this is a thought-experiment, not an accusation),
and also postulate that PGP is breakable by NSA (there is no evidence for
this either, just more thought-experiment), then NSA might well instruct PKP
never to license RSA to PGP precisely because they have found a way of
breaking PGP - make a fuss and people assume it's secure, make no fuss and
people assume it's worthless...

You can go recursively insane following this line of thought - little does
he know that I know that he knows that I know that he knows...

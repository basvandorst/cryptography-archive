What are you claiming to be false? That the ``Clipper proposal'' outlaws 
competing encryption technology, or that newspapers said so?

The White House Clipper Q&A sheet asked, rhetorically, whether the White 
House would consider outlawing such technology. The answer was that they 
would think about it. I don't think it's misleading to say that this 
constitutes a proposal to take such action---though not a very strongly 
worded proposal. In any case it's quite plausible that some newspapers 
said so.

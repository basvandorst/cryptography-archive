Why can't you just encrypt data before the clipper chip?

Two answers:

1) the people you want to communicate with won't have hardware to
   decrypt your data, statistically speaking.  The beauty of clipper
   from the NSA point of view is that they are leveraging the
   installed base (they hope) of telephones and making it impossible
   (again, statistically) for a large fraction of the traffic to be
   untappable.

2) They won't license bad people like you to make equipment like the
   system you describe.  I'll wager that the chip distribution will be
   done in a way to prevent significant numbers of such systems from
   being built, assuring that (1) remains true.

This use of consumer and marketplace pressure is a clever first for
the government cryptography community.

Someday, of course, it may become illegal to do what you describe.
One can guess that eventually it will be not be possible to send data
without a valid (checkable with the system key only) law enforcement
field, and that the only way to generate such a field is with a real
clipper chip, and that the only systems with such chips also will not
have the ability to encrypt data prior to transmission.  Of course,
this won't be enforceable, but that doesn't prevent them from dreaming.

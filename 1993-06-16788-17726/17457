Nope. The license is unenforceable because it contains no consideration 
for RSADSI. RSADSI is saying, in effect, ``We promise not to sue you for 
patent infringement''; under state law you cannot force RSADSI to keep 
a unilateral promise.

If you don't understand how this works, have your lawyer review the 
license. He'll tell you exactly what I'm telling you: as a user of 
RSAREF you have no recourse if RSADSI decides to terminate its 
``perpetual'' license.

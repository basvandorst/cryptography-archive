Kahn's descriptions of solutions of transposition ciphers
seem to contain a common thread (pls correct if I'm wrong):
multiple anagramming. Two ciphertexts, ideally of the
same length, are obtained.  They are written out, one above
the other, and the paper is sliced vertically so the Nth
slip of paper contains the Nth letter of ciphertext from
each message.  Then the slips are rearranged until
a sensible message appears FOR BOTH CIPHERTEXTS.

It seems to me that the simple expedient Kahn attributes
to the Soviets would thwart this approach: pick a random
location in the cleartext, cut the cleartext message there,
put the second half before the first half, then encipher
via transposition.  Take the digits that represent the
position in the cleartext where this fore-and-aft swap
occurred, encipher them by some other means, and place
at the front (or back) of the ciphertext.

Multiple anagramming, as described above anyway, fails
because now the corresponding characters in the ciphertexts
do not correspond in the plaintexts.

Undoubtedly this simpleton approach has been bettered by
other, stronger, methods.  I'd like to know, what are they?

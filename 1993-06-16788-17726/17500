   Ok... I do not have sufficient knowledge of all the mathematics behind
       the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm so I have a few questions ::


       Suppose I have a system  Ax = b

       1) suppose I generate a seq of 2n bits by performing 
          the dot-product between a random U vector and  A^i*b for 
          i = 0 to 2n-1

          feed these 2n bits to B-M

          then *IF* the polynomial returned by B-M has 0 as the const term
          does this imply   f(A) * b = 0  ??
          [I know it does if A is singular .... but I am also getting
            some polynomials s.t.  z|f(z)  when A is nonsingular ]
                                       

       2) Would anyone happen to have a reference to B-M besides the
          error correcting code book of Zierler ??
          [the alg given in there does not *seem* to be correct]

       3) If anyone has a working version of B-M could they generate some
          valid test data for me to test my coded routine from the Zierler
          book  (like say 20 trials of 8 bit sequences (valid sequences))

    [to whomever is curious .... I have coded routines to run Wiedemann's 
       algorithm (and will code Coppersmith's  Block-Wiedemann)
     everything seems to be working but for the algorithm I coded from
      Zierler's book]
          
  C++ya,
  Tom

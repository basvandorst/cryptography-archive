Our computer center has made an IDEA-based encryption program available
on all the UNIX machines it maintains, and they make a fairly strong
claim as to its security.  Here is an excerpt from the man page...

        IDEA, originally called IPES, was published in 1990.  It is
   relatively new but so far has proven to be resistant to all known
   attacks.  Since a 128-bit key is used, exhaustive key-space search
   attacks are not feasible.  IDEA appears to be the cipher of choice for
   the future.  Nevertheless, it has not been exposed to the same amount
   of scrutiny and attacks that DES has.  

How secure is IDEA?  Is it the "cipher of choice for the future?"

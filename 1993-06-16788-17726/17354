I find either of the first two unlikely, though imaginable.  As for
expiration, the patent on RSA won't expire until the next century.  On
a networking system which doubles in size in a matter of months, this
is effectively "forever"; we can only imagine what the net will be
like in 2001.  If PGP doesn't have a good, scalable key distribution.


By the way, when considering solutions, take any proposed solution
that starts out with "We just get all sites to run this new server..."
or "We modify the server for this existing service so it does this..."
and throw it out immediately.  Only a small handfull of sites will be
interested at first, so a system has to work with only a few
participants.

it is drowned in fatuity.		- Chomsky

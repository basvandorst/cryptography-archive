Could you post the license?  I get:

% ftp ftp.tis.com
Connected to AZALEA.TIS.COM.
530 Only DNS registered hosts in the US/Canada can use this server.

Sour grapes?  Hardly.  Anyway, seems you're right about the
information - looking at the dates I see that the message is from
April, the license agreement is from December 1992 and the TIS/PEM
which is being talked about is a beta version.  I'll quote some
restrictions which prompted me to recommend against using TIS/PEM:

"Reading the fine print of the announcement, however, we find that:

   o When the system is released for regular use, users must obtain
     certificates through the regular certificate issuing channels and
     pay whatever fees are required.  During the test period, there is no
     charge for certificates.  When a regular certificate issuing mechanism
     is in place you will be informed.

					(TIS/PEM beta invitation/license)

Furthermore, the licence agreement specifies that TIS/PEM can _only_ be
used with Certification Authorities which TIS authorizes:

   2. TIS/PEM is to be used only with certificates issued under a
      Certification Authority which is itself registered under a permanent
      or temporary Policy Certification Authority (PCA).  TIS is operating
      a PCA and will supply PCA services without charge during the beta
      test period."

There were also other restrictions, for example the software couldn't
be freely distributed to others.  I'd like to hear what the
restrictions are now.

>TIS/PEM is freely distributable software [1], just not to people
>outside the US and Canada...

And not to people not being U.S. citizens or having green cards?
An interesting definition of "freely distributable".

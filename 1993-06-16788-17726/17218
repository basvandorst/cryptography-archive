On the contrary, OTP use is very fast (2x the data, but almost no
computational requirements), and no more error-prone than any other
method of encryption similarly implemented (ie, automated use of OTPs
works as well as automated use of block ciphers). Furthermore, only
the pad itself needs to be hand-carried.   One pouch could hold enough
pads to encrypt several years' worth of diplomatic traffic, though I'd
advise against it.

Perhaps.  Perhaps it's because a slightly-educated group of people see
no reason to use anything less than unbreakable crypto, given that you
can protect the keys.  Perhaps it's because it provides such a
beautiful example of an easily-described crypto system that a child
could implement, so as to demonstrate the futility of limiting crypto 
in a free society.

   I don't think this is at all correct. Depending on the escrow agencies, they
   become YOUR agents, just as your bank is. Since you have prior knowledge
   that they are YOUR agents for holding keys (assuming you accept the
   voluntary Clipper deal), law enforcement still needs to serve specific
   subpoenas on your agents to get the keys.

All right, so what's the equivalent of a numbered Swiss or Panamanian
bank account?  Or cash?

   It would not be too far removed to suggest that an analogy with banks isn't
   inappropriate. To get a bank account, you have to agree to the Federal
   Reserve regulations as they affect that account, including any
   record-keeping requirements with respect to your transactions, just as to
   get Clipper you have to agree to the escrow regulations. The bank is your
   agent, and you haven't been subpoenaed without evidence just because the
   bank has your financial data. For law enforcement to get it takes a specific
   subpoena.

Oh, foo.  If I don't like the regulations of a bank, I'm free to shop
around for another bank, or to invest in a mutual fund, or to put my
money in overseas investments.

The bank is not my agent.  The bank borrows my money, and pays me
interest for the use of said money.  An agent of whatever kind
represents me in a certain situation (such as selling my house) in
return for a fee.  The escrow agency has no contract with me, and
provides me with no service whatsoever.

   David Sternlight         Great care has been taken to ensure the accuracy of

Humpf.  The truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth is more
satisfying, thank you.

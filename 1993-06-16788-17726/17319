	   As I've mentioned earlier, the biggest problem I see with the
   OTP is that the key is [I don't know the technical term] NON-memorizable.
   Suppose I have a 1Mb data file encrypted with a OTP. There's no way I
   can possibly memorize the 1Mb key/pad for my data - I have to keep it
   someplace. That means that if I lose it, I am hosed because my data *is*
   unrecoverable. That means that if I'm cavity searched and they find that
   8mm tape where I hid it (ouch!) then the data is compromised. Memorizable
   keys (IDEA keys, DES keys, etc) have the advantage that you don't *HAVE*
   to keep the key written down.

One-Time Pads don't have to be used in isolation - you could use one 
superencrypted with a standard symmetric-key algorithm for which
you've memorized the keys, which means that the Bad Guys still need
to beat the key out of you to decrypt anything, just as they do with your 
PGP passphrase.  Using the symmetric-key algorithm in CBC mode would
make exhaustive search difficult.

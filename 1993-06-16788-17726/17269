  The plural "people" appears to be inappropriate in this case.  The one
person who makes this claim has never provided any basis for the assumption,
and in fact has explicitily described it as an assumption (he appears to treat
it like a postulate in geometry: a statement that must be taken without proof
as a foundation for proving other statements).

"Thought by some..."  Can you name any person who has seen the
algorithm who thinks so?  If not, don't say this.

Ah, so it's not just "thought by some to be more secure" now- it
definitely is more secure.  In order to be able to make a statement of
this kind you must either have attempted an attack on the algorithm
yourself or know of someone (or some organization) who has attempted
one.

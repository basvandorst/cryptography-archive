  Another groundless assumption.  First, to draw favorable conclusions about
Clipper based on selected technical information released by its creators is
obviously unwise; it is rather like evaluating a computer system based solely
on the information found in its advertising campaign.  Second, there is no
available basis on which to rule out other explanations for the extra
complexity (e.g. concealment of a trapdoor).

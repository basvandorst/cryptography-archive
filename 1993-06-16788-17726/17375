:Given that spooks are *very* prone to disseminating disinformation, then
:there's also possibility 3: they *can* crack 128-bits, but not much higher,
:so if they get the legal limit dropped to 64-bits people will incorrectly
:assume that 128-bits is safe...

[etc].

:OK, the estimates of hardware capability that keep popping up on here make
:this unlikely.  So maybe there's a back-door and they make the big fuss about
:key-size so we think there isn't.

   To expand that, let's say that a 512-bit key is not decipherable.  256-bit
is barely decipherable.  128 is fairly simple.  64 is toothpaste.  Even without
the back-door, the proposal is doggie doo.
   Given a back-door, a 4294967296-bit key (2^32) is useless.
   Unfortunately, word from a friend is that the USG will find you if you're
good, give you two alternatives, one of which is to work for them and the
other is altogether untenable, so the _really_ good people (apologies to
those on the net who really know what they're doing) are subverted into
government service, with appropriate warnings about how painfully they'll
die if they reveal any information.  That leads me to believe that the
_REALLY_ good people are in NSA or CIA in crypto, while we here are left
to our own devices.
   (Friend was subverted into drug warfare.  Tells the story that one of
his compadres removed his respirator for a few seconds, scratched his
beard, put the respirator on, and was dead in 93 seconds.)

:Hmm, while I'm feeling paranoid...  Several people have advanced the
:hypothesis that PKP is an arm of the NSA and is tasked with making sure that
:RSA is never used in combination with a strong encryption scheme.  If we
:assume this to be true (this is a thought-experiment, not an accusation),
:and also postulate that PGP is breakable by NSA (there is no evidence for
:this either, just more thought-experiment), then NSA might well instruct PKP
:never to license RSA to PGP precisely because they have found a way of
:breaking PGP - make a fuss and people assume it's secure, make no fuss and
:people assume it's worthless...

   Altogether, an EXCELLENT analysis!!!!!!!!!!!

:You can go recursively insane following this line of thought - little does
:he know that I know that he knows that I know that he knows...

   I'm only paranoid because I know they're watching me (see previous post
if you think I'm kidding!)...

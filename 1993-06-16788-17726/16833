Subject:Implementations in C/C++ (High Precision, Eliptic Curve, Sparse Matrix)

I'm looking for C/C++ (or Ada) code to:
  Multiply (High) Multiple precision numbers (using infix) for RSA.
    Perhaps using Descrete fast fourier transform? (Add, mod, divide also.)
    (I'd like to be able to use my existing C RSA program with minimal change.)
  Implement state of art Factoring Algorithms (e.g. Lenstra's Elliptic
    Curve or Number Field Sieve)
    Perhaps using sparse matrix techniques?  Continued Fractions?

Was source code distributed in order to factor large numbers within the last
few years?  Where do I find it?  (Was distributed factoring done this way?)

What algorithms have implementations in C readily available (aside from DES,
RSA, Snefru, Dist-Hash and MD5)?  (I'm especially interested in
implementations of articles from "Cryptology" or FOCS/STOC.)

Code to crack simple classical ciphers?  Hints for techniques?  (I read the
FAQ, and have seen the relaxation method.  I'm interested in more details.
I also read [SP89] and Denning 1984.)

  Yep, the opinion that blacks should ride in the back of the bus should
have been left to sober intellectual discussion.
  (But, then again, in a democracy, where three wolves and a lamb get to

segregation so long as the majority approved of it.  Good thing we have
a republic instead of a democracy.)

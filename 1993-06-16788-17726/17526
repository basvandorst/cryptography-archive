[[The multi-level quoting in this thread have overflowed my personal
  stack, hence no specific attributions.  Sorry...]]

Several people in this thread have written comments of the form
(paraphrased)
"we [sic] don't trust <name of some country> government agencies
 not to spy on us."

From context, the posters all probably meant "we" to refer to the
USA's government and/or citizenry.  Err, uh, may I point out that
not everyone reading sci.crypt is American, or takes "we" to mean
the USA's government and/or citizenry?

If you really mean "Americans don't trust <name of some country>
government agency not to spy on us?", then why not say so?  Or,
if you really mean to say "People in general don't trust the
government agencies of *any* foreign country not to spy on us?",
then why not say that?  These have somewhat different nuances of
meaning; reading posts with the ambiguous "we" I'm sometimes not
sure just *what* the poster meant.

Yours for linguistic clarity and less parochialism,

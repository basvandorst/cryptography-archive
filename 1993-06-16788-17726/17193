I cannot agree with that statement. The best public domain file compression
program (according to my tests) is 'lha' and for compressed text with
size of compressed data 600K I have measured entropy 7.998993/byte - 
just 8-1e-3. Encrypted file of approx the same length, (my encryption program
which is also posted here has been used) gives entropy 7.9997, which is
8-3e-4. It should be looked more on the difference from 8. On short files
the differences are not so obvious. 

Anyway, much better test for distinguishment of compressed and crypted file
is chi-square test of occurencies of bytes (0-255), or also byte pairs.
I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANY OUTPUT OF COMPRESSION PROGRAMS WHICH WOULD PASS
CHI-SQUARE TEST!
THE OUTPUT OF MY (AND ANY STRONG) ENCRYPTION  PROGRAM PASSES THIS TEST.
Therefore it is VERY EASY to distinguish compressed and encrypted files.

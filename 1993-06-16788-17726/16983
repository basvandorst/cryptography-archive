Umm, David?  How does the Clipper chip in any way prevent "the bad guys"
from getting really secure communications?  Even if the government is also
planning to outlaw use of OTHER techniques, the Clipper chip has NO EFFECT
on the bad guys.

Mortimer: "Gee, we've got a 500 kilo shipment of coke coming in this weekend;
           we've got to let the folks at the drop sites know when to be there."

Snidely:  "Too bad secure communications are illegal... I guess we just have
           to cancel this shipment rather than break the law by using our new
           computerized RSA encryption equipment and that new narrow-beam low-
           power transmitter.  What a shame."

Not, shall we say... likely?

Now I completely understand why folks always compare crypto restrictions to
gun control... the argument is always "Let's keep this stuff out of the hands
of the criminals!"  But the criminals ignore the law (that's what makes them
criminals in the first place!), so the only lasting effect is a reduction in
the liberty and privacy of the law-abiding citizens.

No thanks.

Something I have been asking myself lately, in light of Clipper et. al., is
what does the government consider as "cryptography"?  Webster has his opinion

   cryp.tog.ra.phy  \krip-'tag'fe  n.
      1. Secret writing
      2. The enciphering and deciphering of messages in secret code or cipher

which isn't terribly specific.  Wasn't it during WWII that we (the US) used
Navajo indians speaking their native tounge make some radio transmissions
unintelligible by the enemy?  Could one then infer that speaking a language
that is "obscure to one's government" would fall into the cryptography
category?   How are these cases dealt with in terms of export controls?
Could I then not sell a cassette tape overseas that teaches people to speak
Navajo?  If doing that is acceptable, then where is the line about what is
acceptable and what is not?  Which of these are "exportable" methods of
encryption:

	. Speaking a foreign language
	. A Caesar cipher
	. DES, RSA, ...
	. [something I dream up myself]

Now one could argue that language is exempt because it is not necessarily
secret, but then you get to define what secret really is.  How many people
have to know before it is no longer secret -- or is it a matter that the
government has to know before it is no longer secret.

In any case, restricting the use of cryptography is about as silly as saying
that you can't speak a certain language because I can't understand you nor
can I find anyone that can.

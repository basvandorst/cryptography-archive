Did you have any specific telecommunications aspects in mind? While I have
no academic credentials, I do have eleven years experience as a U. S. Air
Force Telecomminications Systems Maintenance Technician/Supervisor that
I could use to answer some questions.

One of the problems with any cryptographic system is it's sensitivity to
transmission interference. Phenomena such as crosstalk, fading and
general line noise can cause some systems to "lose their place" and
hash any subsequent decryption. That's why many military secure nets
use double or triple transmission paths -- to insure a good receive
without requiring acknowledgements and retransmissions. Fast-response
mission orders cannot wait while someone says "How's that again? I
missed it the first time."

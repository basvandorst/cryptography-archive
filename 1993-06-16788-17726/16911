I've been unable to discover much information
on the *cryptographic* credentials of Prof. Dorothy
Denning, so I ask the Net for assistance.  I did
the standard things, namely look her up in Kahn,
look her up in Cryptologia and in its condensed book
edited by Deavours, and look her up in the Index
sections of each book in the "Cryptography" section of
the Silicon Valley bookstore, Computer Literacy.

I came up empty; no mention of DD.

Would somebody kindly post a summary of her (published)
work in *cryptography*?  I'd be grateful and I suspect
others might be too.

  [Please note, I'm less interested in her work in other
   fields (e.g. compilers, societal impacts of personal
   computers in kindergarden, cellular automata, layered
   network protocols, etc etc).  Perhaps she has a fine
   singing voice and plays an excellent game of Gin Rummy.
   But I'd like to know about her and *cryptography*.]

Thank You,
  MJ

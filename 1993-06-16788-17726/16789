Due to the underwhelming response to my last post on
this subject, I thought I'd try again and re-phrase
the question.

Will this work?

Using an RSA type encryption device, is it possible to
set up a secure "group key" by the following method:

1. All members of the group are trusted.
2. All members of the group have the device.
3. All members have individual public-private key pairs.
4. One of the members generates a new public-private key
   pair.
5. Distribute the group public key to the other members 
   (and everyone else.)
6. Encrypt the group private key and the password using
   each members individual public key, and send it to 
   them.

I came up with this scheme when I was trying to figure
out how a group using an email system with a bulletin
board feature could completely use encrypted messages.
When a new member joins the group. He/She is given the
device and generates a new key pair. All email to this
person would be encrypted. That is simple enough, but
the bulletin board feature is still quite usefull. So,
the group key would be given to them either in person,
or by mail (no need for a secure channel).

By secure I mean in as secure as RSA and DES/IDEA ect..
are secure. Or is the fact that you are sending the 
secret key and password, albeit encrypted, inherently
insecure?

Thanks,
Rudy

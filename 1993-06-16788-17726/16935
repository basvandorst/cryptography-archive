TIS/PEM uses the RSAREF code, but has a different license that allows
broader use than the normal RSAREF license.

My license agreement makes no such mention of me being a tester and/or
a test period.  The CHANGES files states that the release I have is
the ``first official release of TIS/PEM to the Internet community''.
Sounds to me like you have old information and are trying to use it as
sour grapes.

TIS/PEM interfaces nicely with the Rand Mail Handler (so the manual
claims - I haven't had time to install it yet) which is more than
I can say about PGP the last time I looked.  I use MH, so this is
an important consideration to me.

You claim that PGP is ``much less hassles'', but you can't even compare
the two BECAUSE:

TIS/PEM is freely distributable software [1], just not to people
outside the US and Canada...

I'm not trying to sound gloaty or anything, I have the same problem.
For example, you can use PGP whereas I feel that I cannot due to the
fact that I don't want to expose myself and my employer to a legal
problem in the US.  For me, PGP is a much bigger (legal) hassle.

In the end, I think that you and I agree on a few things.  TIS/PEM is
claimed to be an ``Internet Reference Implementation of Privacy
Enhanced Mail (PEM)'' yet it can't even be exported outside of the
US.  ``Internet Reference Implementation'' --- what a joke, the
Internet has long since encompassed areas outside the US.  TIS should
call their software an ``Internet Reference Implementation of Privacy
Enhanced Mail (PEM) for US and Canada Users of the Internet''.  Of
course that wouldn't quite have the same ring to it... :-)

I'm not sure if the current situation is funny or sad.

Regards,
Loren

order for them to obtain the software.  Not quite the GNU GPL or PD,
but it will do.

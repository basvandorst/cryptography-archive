The Acting Director of NIST, Ray Kammer, announced yesterday at the 3rd
CPSR Cryptography and Privacy Conference in Washington, DC that NIST was
going to release another Federal Register announcement on DSS in the next
week. The next FIPS will take into account the comments about key size,
compatability etc.

They also announced that the administration was slowing down their
internal review and now would not complete it until fall instead of
finishing it up quickly in June.

Sounds like the only logical conclusion to me also.  I saw quoted
somewhere that "Criminals wouldn't use Clipper," with the
implications that "honest" people would.  I guess it makes it
fairly easy then to spot the criminals, then!  Heck, maybe
they'll even publish a book about these dangerous villains!
  

On another note, I've been trying to figure out if this scenario
would work: run your message through RSA or whatever your choice
is, then send it through a Clipper chip.  Seems to me that there
shouldn't be any way to tell by the final encrypted message that
this was done, unless an attempt is made to eavesdrop.  

If the government then cracks down on you, wouldn't it be
conceivable to sue for illegal wiretapping?  Unless of course
they had a reason...in any case, they wouldn't know what you're
saying.  

I realize this is more complicated than it should be, and I don't
profess to be an expert on cryptography, but it seems like a work-
around that makes you look like a typical PC citizen, without
surrendering your privacy to the public good.

  Well, so much for protecting key American technological and economic
secrets....
  The Administration has put itself right behind the eight ball with its
own Monsters Under The Bed rhetoric.  Any foreign government (short of
a pariah state like Iraq) that wants to get our escrow records need only
make a plausible claim that they need them to fight Drug Dealers,
Terrorists, etc. and the United States must either hand over the keys or
make a mockery of the whole rationale for the Clipper project.

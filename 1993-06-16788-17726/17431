I know that Hampshire, England, is neither the Centre of the Universe or 
even close to Redwood, USA, but a little passenger pigeon told me that all
is *not* sweetness and light.

Though I have no first hand knowledge of the matter, it was widely reported 
(and not just on the Net) that at a recent conference in Redwood, Bizdos 
did say that PGP was in breach of the RSA patent because the authors has 
never applied for a licence. There was a clear implication that if they 
stood in line and applied for a licence, they would be treated as 'regular 
Joes', along with any other US applicant.

Well, PGP 2.3 was prepared with a view to using RSAREF rather than RSA and
a properly couched licence application was made for the use of RSAREF. Without
telling tales out of school, no licence was granted though no good reason was 
given for witholding one. PGP 2.3's release was delayed and, when it came, it 
was therefore without RSAREF and still in conflict with Bizdos's version of 
what is lawful. The difference is that now it is clear that the continuation 
of the conflict of interest is entirely at the behest of J.B.
 
Someone is being more than economical with the truth.

This is not an ad hominem attack on a CEO for the actions of his board. J.B. 
made the statements in Redwood; it was to J.B. that the letter of application 
was made; it is J.B. who has prevaricated on what should have been the routine
sanction of a licence application. 

Neither science nor technology, I know, but what are they worth without a 
leavening of ethics?

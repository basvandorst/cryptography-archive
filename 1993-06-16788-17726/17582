IMHO it's rather a pot-boiler.  (Like everyone else who reads it) I
was very impressed by "The Codebreakers", and bought KOK sight unseen.
There were a few mildly interesting pieces in it, but I was disappointed.
Most of the book consists of previously published articles by the
author, although footnotes and sometimes updates have been added.

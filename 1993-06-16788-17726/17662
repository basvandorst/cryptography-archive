I don't think this is true.  In particular, if you are referring
to RSAREF, it's not true.  In fact, the president of RSADSI
spoke approvingly of a secure rlogin written with RSAREF, and
that's clearly not an email application.  (The secure rlogin
was a project done outside of RSADSI & I don't know whether
it was ever released.)

I'd like to know more about HTTP.
If performance is an important consideration, Kerberos 
wins out over public key.

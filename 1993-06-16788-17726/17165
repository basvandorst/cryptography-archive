Wrong!  Marian Rejewski figured out the rotor wirings using group
theory.  He needed material to work on, which was obtained from a spy,
but the actual rotor wirings can be figured out if you have enough
instances of plaintext, a key, and the corresponding ciphertext.

The spy, whose name was Asche, supplied old key tables, some
sample ciphertext and plaintext for an older Enigma model, and the
operating instructions for the then-current military Enigma.

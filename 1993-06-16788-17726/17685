Legal challenge to the PKP patent in the US is limited to challenging the basis of
the original grant. Even according to the lunatic US rules the scope of the
patent is probably flawed. I was pointing out the flaws that would invalidate
it in Europe. By definition there is no point in encouraging publication of 
secrets by granting limited term monopolies for already published works. 

Unfortunately I don't see any real opportunity for a workable compromise. The
US laws in this area are simply to restrictive (ie re import/export). Rather
than cripple the European research effort in this area I suggest that we 
implement the best possible scheme and the guys in the US can pick it up
in 2000 once the patent is expired. Meanwhile they can use the best form
of protection their government feels is compatible with their role of
protecting rights in the world.

Note that W3 supports multiple authentification schemes via the authorization
field. I don't see any reson to omit usefull protocols from the spec because
of bogus patent grants that have only local effect. By definition authorisation
is a closed type of system where I am not too bothered if people from the
USA cannot access a server restricted to CERN main site for example.

Whatever system is adopted it will be illegal to export the code from Europe
to the US or vice versa under the US self imposed COCOM restriction. So 
effort will have to be diverted into separate developments in any case.

Certainly I see no point in using a form of encryption deliberately bongoed
so that it can be cracked (UNIX password scheme.. DES... etc).

	Probably the same thing as would happen if you send
encrypted paper mail, or paper mail written with vanishing
ink, or paper mail written in crayon that was illegible. The
folks who read citizen mail to gather input would scratch
their heads for a while and probably give up trying to
decipher it.
 
>(2)  What happens to them?  Do they waste $$$ trying to decipher it?

	The folks who read citizen mail are volunteers, just
like the folks who read paper mail and the mail from kids. I
suspect that unless any of them are bored cryptowizards, the
mail would not be deciphered. The Secret Service takes any
threats against the President very seriously, so if your
encrypted mail were somehow threatening (that would be a
trick), they might want to talk to you. Those folks take
protecting the President VERY seriously, and it's my
impression that NO threat, be it paper mail, email, or
carrier pigeon is ignored. I suspect that encrypted stuff
is more "crank mail" than "threatening mail."

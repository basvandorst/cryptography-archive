Paranoia still lives!  The whole purpose of Comsec is to focus an attack
*away* from a Communications Interception attack of clear data.  Many
methods for getting data *before* it gets to a Comsec device are well
known and documented.   It's pretty silly to think you have to put in
some special circuit to "help out" what high school kids have liberated
with an old tv tuner and $50 at Radio Shack.    You're still at a much
larger risk overseas than you are here.

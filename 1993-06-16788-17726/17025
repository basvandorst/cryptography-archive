Excuse me David - why cannot I, as an individual, choose *not* to purchase
the products of DD because I disagree with the policies she advocates?  And
why cannot I, as an individual, *urge* others not to purchase DD's books?
Yes, forcing people not to purchase her books would be wrong, but Patrick
wasn't advodating that.

> Why don't we just make her wear a yellow armband?

The difference between the two courses of action is obvious to anyone with
the intelligence of a lobotomised slug.  Forcing DD to wear a yellow armband
(with all the loaded connotations you clearly intended to imply) is an
infringement of her rights.  You implication that boycotting DD should not
be permitted would be an infringement of my rights to choose what I purchase,
from whom and for whatever reasons.

I know there's absolutely no hope of convincing you of the error of your
ways, so I've directed followups to alt.fan.david-sternlight.  Why clog up
a serious group with David's mis-directed ravings when there's a group
dedicated to those people who like to laugh at him?

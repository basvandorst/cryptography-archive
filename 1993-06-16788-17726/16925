Dunno about PEM, but PGP is not, as you know, freely distributable in the
U.S., and has been removed by university authorities from their sites on
which it has shown up. A more accurate statement is that the PGP authors
have no objection to free distribution, but others, claiming it is a patent
infringement in the U.S., do, and carry enough weight for whatever reason
that whenever they've asked for PGP to be removed or work discontinued on it
in the U.S., the recipients of such requests have complied.

PEM is also not clearly free in the U.S.--as I understand it, TIS/PEM is a
commercial product though the betas are currently free in the U.S. and
Canada for non-commercial testing.

(By the way, your use of PEM needs to be qualified--the situation is likely
different for RIPEM, TIS/PEM, Mac RIPEM, etc. etc. In this thread we're
talking about TIS/PEM.)

Factual responses only, please. I think most readers are tired of people
turning factual issues into flame wars.

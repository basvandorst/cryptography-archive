  Another reason for 
   bringing Clipper to market is that it could be too late to do anything 
   at all about the law enforcement needs if telephone security devices such
   as the AT&T device come to market and take off using something like DES.

   Even though I believe the chip should go forward, I also believe
   that we will be debating the issues and considering alternative
   policies & technical approaches for the indefinite future.  The only 
   thing that I can think of that might stop the debate would be a national 
   decision to stop all controls on crypto technology.  This would be a 
   giant leap from where we are now, so don't hold your breadth :-) "

  	Well, I think you are in the minority in most of your views.
Mainly, security agencies are interested in limiting the science of
cryptology.  I think we have lost perspective when we, the public,
allow the elected government to have the power to eavesdrop on 
"private" communications.  The government is in a position to abuse
their authority simply because they are entrusted with so much 
authority.  Watergate, for example.  And the Iran-Contra affair, for
a more recent example.  
	I do not deny the importance of law enforcement.  However,
it is a logical assumption that if a controlled technology like
the Clipper chip (which is assumed to have a backdoor, since the
algorithm that governs its operation has not been made available) 
becomes a legal standard, then someone who has good reason to keep
their information hidden from government agencies, will double encrypt
said information.  Where, then, is the benefit?
	A good encryption algorithm does not rely on the encryption
technique being kept secret.  You, Ms. Denning, know that.  Furthermore,
there are a number of encryption techniques that exist *de facto* in
the public domain.  The debate as to the best technique, and to the 
development of new techniques, will continue.  We need not hold our
breath.  The debate will continue regardless of the government's 
decision.

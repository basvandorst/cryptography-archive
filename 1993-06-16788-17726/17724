I have similar datapoints from the last few years which point to NSA hiring
outside expertise (read: catching up) in the fields mentioned.  Similar
conclusions could be drawn from the type of mathematics used in these
schemes, and the amount of time and manpower needed to develop
organizational expertise in the related fields, compared to the math used
in schemes like DES and RSA.  Check out e.g. Tsfasman and Vladut,
"Algebro-Geometric codes" -- it uses the whole machinery of scheme theory,
Drinfeld modules, and other stuff orders of magnitude more complex than
RSA and its relatives.  Or the Chudnovsky & Chudnovsky approach to fast
multiplication in finite fields, also based on algebraic geometry. Or any
of the massive literature on elliptic curves and modular forms (relevant to
factoring).

It's not surprising that NSA could smell the potential of these areas and
hire appropriate people, but that's very far away from having expertise
which outweighs what's available in the academic community, let alone
enough to translate the theory into practical ciphers and analytic schemes.

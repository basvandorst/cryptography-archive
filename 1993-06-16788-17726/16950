This isn't the 19th century, when a nomenclator was the summit of
security.  Amateur contributions to crypto are pretty much uniformly
junk, because amateurs haven't spent time breaking cryptosystems.

Who invented RSA?  Professionals.  DES?  Professionals.  FEAL, IDEA,
Snefru, Khufu?  Professionals.

(Who invented Enigma?  An amateur.  Was it better than anything else
available at the time?  Hardly -- and it was broken off and on over
its entire lifetime.)

In crypto, 'amateur' does mean 'incompetent'.  But amateurs never
believe this, and tend to think a system is secure if they themselves
can't figure out a way to break it.

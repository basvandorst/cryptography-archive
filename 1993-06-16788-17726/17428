Here's the simplest way.

The RSAREF license is unenforceable under California law, because it
contains no consideration for RSADSI. (It is also unenforceable by
virtue of being a shrinkwrap license. It will also not be accepted as
evidence in most courts, as it's electronic. Other than that it's fine.
[grin])

Jim Bidzos can simply send a ``cease and desist'' letter to every 
registered user of RSAREF and follow up a few days later with patent
infringement lawsuits. Unless his patents are struck down by the Supreme 
Court, there's no reason he wouldn't succeed.

The simplest mechanism is also the most secure, reliable, and obvious:
_Don't ask who owns a key_. If a message is signed with a key, it was 
sent _from_ that key. If a message is encrypted under a key, it was sent 
_to_ that key. If you must use names, treat them the way the French do:
instead of ``my name is'' (``mon nom est''---ugh) say ``I call myself''
(``je m'appelle''). If two people call themselves by the same name, who
cares? Duplicated names are a fact of life. All that's important for 
cryptography is that _keys_ are distinct.

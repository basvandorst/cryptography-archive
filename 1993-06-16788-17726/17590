   Mark Riordan (mmr@sccs3.cl.msu.edu) has a postscript image of a paper found by
   anonymous ftp - ripem.msu.edu:/pub/crypt/docs/des-break.ps.Z.  This
   appears to be where the $30M figure comes from.
       Using Content-Addressable Search Engines to Encrypt and Break DES

That was one of the two designs - the other one was a 1 Gbit/sec (I think)
DES chip built out of a Gallium Arsenide gate array by a guy at DEC;
it's in a technical report on decwrl but I don't have the reference
here at home (since the paper's in Postscript :-).  It would cost
about $16M for the DES chips plus some amount of support chips, I/O,
circuit boards, etc. to build a 1 DES/day machine, so $30M is close.
Given the size of the chip (I think it was about 15,000 gates),
it basically fit 1 round of DES on the chip (S-boxes, etc.) plus data,
so it cranked each item around 16 times to get the result.

It's nice to see the same costs appearing in two radically different designs!

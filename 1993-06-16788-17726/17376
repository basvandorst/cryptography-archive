   Excuse me, serious question, but are we talking about the NSA algorithm
or about the National Security Agency?

   Whether I'm right or wrong, I've said it before and I'll say it again;
a healthy dose of paranoia is part of the profession of cryptology.  Can
you prove it's baloney... is this your "healthy paranoia"... or do you know
something we don't?
   And furthermore... don't you know of any other software company where
greed is the deciding factor?  (Hint... ever heard of Bill Gates?)  In
my humble opinion (spelled out for the Microsoft-impaired), this company
is motivated by nothing but cash flow, and NOTHING will stop them.  Perhaps
the owners of PKP are motivated by the same motives.
   Note also that (IMHO) Microsoft has NEVER EVER EVER produced a bug-free
piece of code.  Ever.
   PKP greedy?  More the power to them.  You and I can come up with
better algorithms... wouldn't YOU like to make money with them?

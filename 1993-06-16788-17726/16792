Here's a footnote Peter Neumann just posted in comp.risks...

   [Incidentally, at last week's IEEE Symposium on Research in Security
   and Privacy, a rump group decided that because crypto falls under
   munitions controls, the right to bear arms must sanction private uses of
   cryptography!  PGN]

Hey, let's all go out and join the NRA and join the crypto lobby with
the gun lobby :) :)

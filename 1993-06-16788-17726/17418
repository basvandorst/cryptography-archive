From the precise definition of random, it is random, and would form a
one-time pad.  Of course, both parties would need a copy of the same.

But this does not make it a good one-time pad.  The meaning of "random"
for this purpose is that all possibilities are equally likely, and not
just the marginals, but the entire joint distribution.  I believe we will
find that modem connection noise is highly structured as well.

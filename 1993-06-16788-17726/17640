I think that 2.3 is a genuine release, though not a release in the form 
orginally intended as, had the request to use modified RSAREF instead of 
PRZ's implementation of the RSA algorithm been granted, that's how it would 
have come out - naturally as a N.America only release.

I don't feel qualified to nitpick such an important piece of work.
 Nevertheless, there may be signs, in 2.2 and 2.3, of over-rapid release 
before comprehensive testing was completed; there are compression problems 
in both. Seems a pity, as a reputation for reliable functioning is essential if
PGP is to become the accepted international standard that it should be.

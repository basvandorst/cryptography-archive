This MIGHT stop the probably rather unimportant abuses hinted at, but even
then not too much.  The very existence of hearings for search warrants 
usually remain secret until after the warrants are formally served, and
even then only the existence of the warrant is made known.  

The problem is not organized crime and foreign intelligence agencies, as
much as the enormous excesses by the government.  Since most judges now
are former prosecutors, it is the rights of the people to be secure from
the government which are in grave danger.  That "Every man's home is his
castle" was British legal philosophy before the US was formed.

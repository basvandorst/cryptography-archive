I would posit that the events of reality in government and "public
service" (especially the civil circus types...) favors the first 
interpretation, david.

Otherwise, why is the government SO intent on finding out what I and 
my fellow citizens is doing?  Altruism?  Oh, yeah, I forgot.  THEY know
better how I should live my life and what I should be thinking that I
do.   I get it.  

Government != rationality or civil rights.
Government = oppressive, venal, intrusive, useless interference.

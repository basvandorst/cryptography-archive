Why not just create sci.crypt.politics and leave sci.crypt alone?  I
do not have a copy of the original charter for sci.crypt, but just as
a guess, I suspect the ranting is rather off-charter.

If anyone has a copy of said charter, could you please post it?  That
would be a good starting point for discussions of a group split.

What do you mean?  You lost me here.  Is it:

1. "According to my assumptions Clipper will work as intended even without
    outlawing other encryption methods"

or:

2. "According to my assumptions Clipper will not die on the market because:
   (a) there are no international incompatibility problems
   (b) there are no international legal problems with Clipper"

All these statements are clearly (I thought) false:

1. No-one with a possible thing to hide will want to use Clipper -- that
   is obvious.  So what is Clipper going to accomplish if other encryption
   methods remain legal?  They _have_ to be criminalized or else the entire
   research and administrative effort that went into development of the
   chip would be wasted.
   Besides, criminals will continue using whatever cryptosystem they please,
   whether legal or not (that is also obvious, I hope).  The bottom line
   is: the looser (as usual) is John Q. Public, not a drug trafficer who
   couldn't care less about fine points of cryptographic law currently in
   fashion in Washington, D.C.

2. Aren't there European countries that already banned Clipper?  How is an
   American company going to communicate securely with a French affiliate?

Actually, IMHO both 1 and 2 really pale when compared to the system's
basic assumption that people have no right to secure exchange of
information.  I am sure such security makes law enforcement more difficult 
but so does freedom of travel, freedom of business ownership, etc.
At its very root the Clipper system is morally corrupt.

<I assume other methods to be less secure than Clipper. 

What if I assume other methods to be _more_ secure?  Why can't I just assume
that and why is my assumption any worse than yours?  The only way to decide
is to make the Clipper algorithm public.

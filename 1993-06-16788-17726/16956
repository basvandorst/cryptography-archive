What I know about Shockley's anthropological/intelligence theories comes
from the article some years ago in the Atlantic Magazine. Without in any way
defending or attacking it (this is not the place for that), my reading shows
that his work is based on an analysis of empirical data, and not, as those
who set out to savage him because they didn't like his conclusions, on any
racist opinions. Thus though your point may be perfectly correct, Shockley
is not the best example to demonstrate it.

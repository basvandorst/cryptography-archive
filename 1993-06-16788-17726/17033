I'm not too familiar with factoring algorithms, but I suspect that the
size of the problem is usually based on the number of bits in the
product.  If you can really factor an n-bit number in sqrt(n) time, I'd
better go learn how that is done.  Otherwise, you've got a problem that
can be solved in Order(2^(n/2)) time, which is exponential, not
polynomial.

The "nondeterministic" nomenclature refers to the hypothetical machine
on which an NP-hard problem can be completed in polynomial time, i.e.,
a nondeterministic finite automaton.  This lovely machine, which I
wouldn't mind having on my desk, clones itself at each decision point
and processes all paths.  Think of it as being able to sweep down the
breadth of a decision tree, no matter how wide it gets.

I used to know why it is called *nondeterministic*, but I have
forgotten, and my dusty textbook is at home.  Sorry, Dr. Ullman!

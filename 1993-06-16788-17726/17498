I like the idea of a mailing list.  Despite my occasional participation in 
discussion of political and commercial topics, the main reason I continue 
reading this group is in the hope for discussion of technical and 
mathematical issues: Bayesian analysis, differential cryptanalysis, topics in 
discrete mathematics and logic, related topics such as steganography & 
traffic analysis, and so on.

Hope springs eternal...

I think the above shows both the dangers of trying to argue from the
particular to the general, and that of overgeneralization.

The way to prevent small goods from becoming greater bads is not to oppose
the small goods, but to oppose the greater bads.

I don't accept the dissident/anarchist argument that it's a bad idea to
license drivers because it might lead to a national identity system and then
to concentration camps. I consider that to be specious and disingenuous
reasoning.

The error in oversimplifying Pastor Niemoller's logic is that it does not
draw the line between legitimate arrest of what he would agree to be
criminals, and the violation of civil liberties. To paraphrase what I
consider to be a correct position:

They came for the murderers and I said nothing. They came for the theives
and I said nothing. They came for the gypsies and I raised my voice.

One man's opinion.

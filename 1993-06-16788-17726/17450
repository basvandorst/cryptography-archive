This is interesting.

Now I give you some numbers, and ask you if the series is random.
The first number is '1'. So is the 2nd, and the 3rd, in fact, every
number I give you is one. Is this series random???

What if I then told you that I generated the series by rolling a
dice....  (pretty unlikely, but possible). and alternatively if I told
you that no matter what number you asked me for, it would always be
'1'. 

From a face reading of you definition you would the series random,
regardless of how it is generated because you can't be absolutely
certain of what the next number would be.

The problem (in my very limited reading) is that you can't look at a
series and say 'that's random'. The best you can do is look at a
process and say 'I can't predict the next number/event so I will call
it random'. 

In mail, rubin indicated that temperate readings are random. But even
enough information, it IS possible to predict the temperature. The
kicker is that prase 'enough information'. 

Take all my ramblings with a very large pinch of salt. Wiser + more
knowledgable heads are welcome to comment/inform.

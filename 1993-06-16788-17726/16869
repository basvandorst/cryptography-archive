No, all of the RSA crypt activity involving your private key should
take place at the palmtop.  You could, for example, have the palmtop
decrypt the per-message key and send it to the workstation over the
serial line, and the workstation would then perform the symmetric
decryption.  Only the per-message key would risk being exposed, not
your private key.  However, since public-key is usually the slow part,
this wouldn't be a major advantage.

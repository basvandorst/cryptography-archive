For details on oversight of Black Budget items read, for example "Blank
Check--The Pentagon's Black Budget" by Tim Weiner, Warner Books (paper).

Though Weiner "exposes" that the black budget items aren't revealed in any
unclassified details, he does acknowledge the auditing and review process
for such classified matters. His complaint isn't that it isn't reviewed or
audited, but that isn't done so openly and publicly.

[Rant about "fixation" on OTP ciphers deleted]

This attitude seems really strange, since my graduate cryptology class
introduced OTPs and stream ciphers along the lines of:

  Using a constant stream (all 0's or all 1's) is trivially breakable,
  but easy to produce.

  Using a OTP consisting of random bits is absolutely unbreakable, but
  a pain since you need to transport the OTP.

  Our goal is to find algorithms for generating bit streams which are
  hard to predict, but easy to transport.

In other words, he introduced a continuum and produced a constant value
as one extreme, and a (random) OTP as the other extreme.  Our studies
would be focused on the best ways to approach the OTP end without actually
having to hook up a geiger counter.  :-)

However, it was clear he was talking about communications with a narrow
"secure" channel, not the wide-open secure channel a diplomatic pouch
provides.

BTW, this doesn't imply that OTPs are the _only_ encryption used.  I can
imagine ways of combining OTPs and other ciphers to produce an even more
secure cipher -- one that won't be totally compromised if the cleaning
woman makes a copy of the OTP.

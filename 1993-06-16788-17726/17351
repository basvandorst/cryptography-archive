 Can someone comment upon whether the following type of protocols exist:

 An adaptive crypto-communications-protocol with the following properties:

 The protocol subsumes an EXTENSIBLE set of encryption-methods.

 The protocol is conducted so that SENDER and RECEIVER may initiate
 a negotiation for encryption-method change at any time.

 At a higher control level of the protocol, 
 SENDER and RECEIVER may (this is a session option, not a default
 behavior) agree to a time-series defining fixed times at 
 which the encryption-method will change.

 The SENDER and RECEIVER may negotiate 'aliases' for protocol commands.
 (e.g. for telephone convesation, some word such as 'however', may be identified
 as an alias for the protocol command: <switch to next encryption-method in
 prenegotiated sequence> .

 Genrally, I am just speculating about possible features of
 an adaptive, multi-encryption-algorithm crypto-protocol which could be
 implemented in a 'for-the-rest-of-us' alternative to the clipper chips etc.

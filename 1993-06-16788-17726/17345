Can you provide specifics?  RSA is running two PCAs that I know about (the 
Low Assurance CA and the Commercial CA), but there is nothing that I know of 
in PEM, or have heard from RSA, that mandates the use of a PCA in one of 
these hierarchies.  You just have to tell your PEM software that the 
independent PCA's self-signed certificate is valid by declaration.

If Jim (or RSADSI in general) has made statements concerning independent 
PCAs, I'd love to see copies.

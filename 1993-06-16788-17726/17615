You know, I keep reading about these ultra super duper DES crackers and
other (ficticious or otherwise) crackers for all kinds of other encryption
schemes, but there is still one thing I do not understand. No matter how
fast you can try different keys, how the devil do you know when you find the
right one?  I seems like all these analyses assume some sort of near
infinite speed pattern matcher that can tell if a given key has actually
cracked the encrypted data, but that seems very unlikely to me.

I suppose there are some forms of data you might be expecting, and you might
be able to recognize instantaneously, but I am not so sure that is generally
true, so how do these gazillion key per second chips help recognize the
right plaintext once they crack the cipher?

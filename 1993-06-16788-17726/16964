Saw this on the net, a great general-purpose quote for many US Federal
government issues.

 "You do not examine legislation in the light of the benefits it will
  convey if properly administered, but in the light of the wrongs it
  would do and the harms it would cause if improperly administered."
                                           -- Lyndon Johnson

-- 
"If everything had gone as planned, everything would have been perfect."
	-BATF spokesperson on CNN 3/2/93, regarding failed raid attempt in TX.

The password is permuted to become a  56 bit key.  Any noninvolved characters
result in 7 bits each being defaulted to logic ZERO.  Shorter allowable 
passwords implies that it is worth while to search the smaller key spaces
first, based on statistical distribution of passwords.

What is even more important is knowledge of the actual password length.

A couple of years ago someone challenged sci.crypt to break a password
and provided the length (4).  I wrote a little routine to generate
4 character passwords and brute forced it using a relatively low performing
crypt(3) (547 crypts/sec).  It took 18 minutes to find 'giap'.  None of
the code was particularly optimized.  I could have found a 5 char password
in a couple of days.

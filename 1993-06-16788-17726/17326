How can A be sure that the public key he/she got is the correct public
key of B? How if somebody substitute B's public key with his own either
by modifying the network file or injecting a replying packet on the
network?
If this cann't be sure, then the system isn't secure at all. Because
someone can just use his own public key to pretend to be B and get
and understand all the message from A.

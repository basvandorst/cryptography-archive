It's the numbers involved that interest me the most.  Specifically, how
difficult
is it to factor a RSA key.  On an earlier post, someone mentioned that
the RSA-120
had been successfully factored.  The investment involved was estimated at 830
MIPS years.  It just so happens that I got a e-mail the other day of a
preliminary
list of the 200 fastest computers in the world.  The list is labeled as being
from the Computing Center at the University of Mannheim.  Anway, you'll never
guess who has the fastest computer?  If you guessed the NSA, your half right.
They have a Connection Machine 5 with 1024 nodes.  So does Los Alamos National
Labs.  (Just what do they do there these days anyway?)  Two performance numbers
are given on the list, albeit without a good explanation of what they are.

The relevant numbers are:  R-max  59,700 MFLOPS
			   R-peak 131,000 MFLOPS

Using the VERY conservative estimate that 1 MFLOPS = 1 mips, along with
the lower
R-max value, we see that the NSA should be able to crack RSA-120 in 

830 mips-years / 59,700 mips = 0.14 years, or just over five days.

RSA-120 is approx. a 400 bit number, so it is safe to assume that the NSA
can break a casual grade PGP key (the 384 bit option) with ease.

It is also worth mentioning that the CM-5 they have only has 1024 processors,
the machine is designed to be easily expandable to a maximum configuration of
5120 processors.  And of course, God only knows how many of the things
they'll buy.  While this will eat up 400-bit numbers for breakfast,
there is a big
difference between 400-bit numbers and 1024 bit numbers.

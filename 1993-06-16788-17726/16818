The problem I see with the crypto/munitions/second ammendment argument is
that the government has clearly established the right to restrict the use
of
firearms, with heavy restrictions on private ownership of items such as
assault
rifles and field artillery.  (The NSA could always make the argument that
1024-bit-key RSA is roughly equivalent to field artillery.)

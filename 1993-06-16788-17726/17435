   Bill, it doesn't take elaborate vocal models to get down to a few 1000
bits/second.  I still have a plastic RECORD from the early 1970's that was
included in an IEEE Spectrum issue.  They play Bell Labs (and others)
low-bit-rate encoders vs. live voice with various delta-modulation, etc.
techniques.  Below 4800 b/s it sounded like BBC radio broadcasts from
some far-away country (the "barrel effect"), and below 1200 b/s it can
barely be labeled English.  But they do go down to 300 b/s, loosing all
inflection and power level changes; the WORDS can still be understood,
but it hurts to listen!

   Not bad for 20+ years ago -- live audio compression hasn't been able
to improve on the low-end numbers by much, but they have improved the
result at that low end.

Yes, yes, yes.

This needs repeating. I don't know why people consistently post ad-hominem
attacks against Ms Denning. I've never seen her flame anyone or be anything
but polite. For some reason, if people don't like the message the first
thing they do is attack the messenger.

On the other hand, it's okay to flame Rumpglow (or is that Sternlight?),
since he often participates at that level.

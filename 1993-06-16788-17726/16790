   Well PGP is available in Europe.  RSA is not patented outside the US
   so you don't need a license to implement it.

However, PGP doesn't use DES for secret-key, it uses IDEA, an
algorithm patented by a Swiss company, Ascom-Tech AG.
No license fee is required for non-commercial use,
but if a company wants to use it for business, they may need a license.

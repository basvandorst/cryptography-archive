Whoops, I thought I was posting in sci.math.  My choice of words
may be slightly too technical for the general public in sci.skeptic
and alt.privacy.clipper.

The idea of the definition is that an infinite sequence of numbers is random
if you may specify any subsequence of it and still get an equal
distribution of numbers.

The word 'specify' bears the formalized qualification of 'computationally'.

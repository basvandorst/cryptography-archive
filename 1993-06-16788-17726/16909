   Oh, forgot... the reason for the extra XOR with a randomly-chosen character
from the key is so that even if the algorithm becomes public (gee, didn't it
just do that?) and the RNG is reproducible and even if random seed values are
tried in a brute-force attack, they still only get gibberish even if they hit
on the correct seed value for the encrypted file.  If the key they choose isn't
_exactly_ the same, but close, they might be able to get started at cracking
it; but (I _think_), unlike solving a polyalphabetic cipher, it should be
pretty difficult to determine the key length and so make the job of cracking
the cipher kinda time-consuming.  (Then again, if their selected key is
close enough to produce _some_ plaintext, they've got the key length...
oh well, so much for that thought.)

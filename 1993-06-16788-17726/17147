I think that

@inproceedings{idea-i,
  author="Xuejia Lai and James L. Massey and Sean Murphy",
  title="Markov Ciphers and Differential Cryptanalysis",
  booktitle={Advances in Cryptology---EUROCRYPT '91},
  year={1991},
  pages={17--38},
  publisher={Springer Verlag}
}

addresses this problem, since they prove that some IDEA variants are
"invulnerable to differential cryptanalysis after sufficiently many
rounds".  So they must have a way to take this into acount.

Hope this helps.  Have fun.

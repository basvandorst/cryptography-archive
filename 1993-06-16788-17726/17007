    Good idea.  Let's restrict discussion and debate of these issues to
constitutional lawyers.  Normal people have no right to advance or defend
opinions if they lack a wall plaque with a law degree.

    You must be new here.  Usenet is an electronic forum through which
people speak as authorities on a wide variety of subjects which surpass
their competency.  I imagine that next you'll be sending the competency
police to barber shops and taxicabs.

Subject: Clipper: What happens when LEF is corrupted?

I posted something along these lines earlier, but sci.crypt was expiring so
fast here that I never saw any replies (if there were any)...

Didn't Someone (Someone being a member of "Them", the source of most
information of the form "I heard that" :) mention earlier that when the LEF
field is corrupted, Clipper just turns the key into 0's without informing
the users?  If this is true, wouldn't the following be a trivial way to
eavesdrop on any Clipper communication?

1) tap the communications channel (phone line, radio frequency, whatever)

2) when the Clipper chips exchange the LEF fields, corrupt the channel.
For example, throw white noise into the channel.  Alternately, pin the
channel to either 0 or 1 for the duration of the LEF.  [To any
phone/digital communications experts: would forcing the line to some
voltage would work here?  How about oscillation the voltage between two
values at the right speed so that the modems or whatever would stay
synchronized and "happy"?]  Or even better, just corrupt a few bits.  I
know there would probably be technical hurdles to overcome, but nothing
that any competent technical person couldn't figure out with a little time
and $$$, right?

3) now both Clipper chips are using keys of 0000..., while their user's
think they have a secure channel!

If my assumption isn't true (namely, Clipper doesn't do anything if the LEF
is corrupted), what's to prevent Joe Drug Dealer or Mary Molester (equal
rights, you know :) from corrupting the LEF to ensure their security?  This
ASS-U-MEs that Clipper has no back doors.  Or is this a good argument for
the existence of back doors?

If the above doesn't hold water, what have I missed?  (Like I said, the
news feed here was expiring stuff FAST - like in half a day...)  Does the
Clipper chip just not work without a valid LEF from another Clipper chip?
This would be a MUCH better way to deal with the problem, IMHO.

Thanks,
Dane

*** Soap Box On ***

Ps. I think this whole Clipper thing is moot anyways.  Even if the gov.
restricts all other crypto, it won't matter.  First, people that really
want to will just ignore the laws.  Second, it will put us at such an
economic disadvantage that the gov. will have to reverse itself in short
order.  In my opinion, economics motivate politics more than any other
factor in this country.

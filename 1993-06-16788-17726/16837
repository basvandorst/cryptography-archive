I don't see how this expensive solution will help unless all of the 
decryption is taking place at the palmtop.  ANYTIME you use a 
multiuser system you run the risk of advertising your pass phrase
and or message.  I can't see any other way to have security at the local
level unless 1. All crypto takes place at a your workstation, or 
2.  You have established an encrypted link between you and the host 
computer.  Isn't terminal connections going the way of the dodo bird 
giving way to client server.

I agree

For RSA, in the UK, definitely not (in as much as any non-lawyer's opinion
can be definite).  There may be licenses required for particular copyrighted
implementations, however.  You can always write your own, though.

For DES, I know not, but I've never seen a DES implementation which
mentioned any required licenses.  The DES spec doesn't (as far as I
remember) mention licensing either.

Export restrictions do not control use of things.  They control export of
things.

There are restrictions on exporting cryptographic software from the USA and
Canada to any other country.  Given that you have the software, though,
there's no restriction on your using it, other than that which may be
imposed by HM Government.

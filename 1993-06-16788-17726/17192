Neat piece of work. It detects my trapdoor using lattice basis reduction - 
a technique which was used in the early 1980's to attack knapsack systems. 
This shows the danger of forgetting any bit of theory, however old, obscure 
or irrelevant it may seem.

Incidentally, I am informed by a highly reliable source that your favourite 
US agency has been trying to dissuade people in receipt of US government 
financial support from doing research on lattice basis reduction.

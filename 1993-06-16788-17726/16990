Subject: RFC 1170 only talks about signatures; RFC 1421 is lying.

ISOC publishes RFCs, some of which are labelled as ``standards.'' In RFC
1310, ISOC places certain strict requirements on standards which use 
patented technology.

RFC 1421, one of the ``proposed standard'' PEM documents, refers to 
these requirements, and claims that PKP ``has provided written assurance 
to the Internet Society,'' namely RFC 1170, in satisfaction of these
requirements. The referenced article quotes this claim.

But (as has been noted before on sci.crypt) RFC 1170 refers only to 
``licenses to practice RSA signatures.'' It doesn't talk about RSA
_encryption_. To the extent that PEM allows _encryption_, rather than 
just signatures, RFC 1421 stands as a blatant violation of ISOC rules.
Its summary of RFC 1170 is simply fraudulent. (It's also historically 
inaccurate: ISOC was created after RFC 1170 was published.)

Attached are the relevant quotes. If the standards process weren't 
dominated by people like Steve Crocker of TIS, who has a financial 
interest in the success of PEM and RSADSI/PKP, then surely ISOC would 
not have allowed RFC 1421 to proceed.

  [ from RFC 1421; note the phrase ``authentication and encryption'' ]
> This version of Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) relies on the use of
> patented public key encryption technology for authentication and
> encryption.  The Internet Standards Process as defined in RFC 1310
> requires a written statement from the Patent holder that a license
> will be made available to applicants under reasonable terms and
> conditions prior to approving a specification as a Proposed, Draft or
> Internet Standard.
  [ also from RFC 1421 ]
> Public Key Partners has provided written assurance to the Internet
> Society that parties will be able to obtain, under reasonable,
> nondiscriminatory terms, the right to use the technology covered by
> these patents.  This assurance is documented in RFC 1170 titled
> "Public Key Standards and Licenses".
  [ from RFC 1170; note ``RSA signatures''---what about encryption? ]
> We assure the
> interested parties that Public Key Partners will comply with all of

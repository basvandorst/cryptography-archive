Now some have alleged that at some times the CIA and NSA have not acted in
complete conformance to ordinary citizens' expectations, which I guess is
what David means by "rogue outfits." We don't trust the French, who have
indicated their intention to commit commercial espionage (as has the CIA). 
They (the French, at least) "cannot be trusted, period." Are our agencies
actually more trustworthy?  

Is this a sign that David is softening his former position?  Is Gibraltar
crumbling?

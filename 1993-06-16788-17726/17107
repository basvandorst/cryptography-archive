Summary: What has happened to cryptography in sci.crypt?
Keywords: sci.crypt, noise, cryptography

Where is cryptography in sci.crypt theese days? It seems that the ratio
of politics to cryptography has increased to over 90%. Please please
split the group ( or have I not been receiving the
.sci.crypt.cryptography group where it is really going on?).
Or maybe it is all a big test and there is really a secret message
embedded in all this political %$&^&*%^ that we are supposed to
decrypt?

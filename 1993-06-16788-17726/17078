I would like to have an RSA implementation for the Macintosh in order to 
do some numerical experimentation for an honors project.  I have ftped the
code available from rsa.com, but it appears that I need the MPW C compiler
to use it.  (Please correct me if I am wrong.  I tried compiling with 
THINK C 5.0 but got errors with ANSI settings on or off.)

I would greatly appreciate any of the following:
1.  A binhexed application mailed to me.
2.  Advice on changes that must be made in order to compile with THINK C.
3.  A site to ftp an application from.

Thank you very much.

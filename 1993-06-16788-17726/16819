This was Samuel Johnson's version. In Ambrose Bierce's "Devil's
Dictionary", he takes issue with Johnson: "With all due respect to an
enlightened but inferior lexicographer I beg to submit that it is the
first."

And then there was Lisa Simpson's version: "Prayer - the last refuge of
a scoundrel". Both versions seem equally appropriate today.

While we're on the subject of famous sayings, has anyone ever
researched the writings of Thomas Jefferson to see if he ever said
anything about the politics of cryptography? He was a cryptographer
himself, so it would seem likely.

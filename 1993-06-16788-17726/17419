   To this I agree entirely.  The search order for keys should be private ring,
   system ring (file stored on the machine for all to look at) then server(s).

   A fast udp-based server shold be a peice of cake.  Integrating it into PGP is
   where I'll leave it to the others.  ;)


As the original poster, I should perhaps re-focus attention on what I
actually said.

A paragraph proposing a heirarchy of autonomous servers, with
communication methods unspecified and with built-in resilience:

] In my opinion, the problem of distribution of PGP keys needs to be
] addressed seriously and in the quite near future.  Again, IMO, there
] *must* be set up a heirarchy of co-operating but autonomous servers.
] The heirarchy *must* be connected through its members communicating
] with, at the very least, their immediate superior and all their
] immediate subordinates.  For resilience, a member should also
] communicate with several of its peers and several of the peers of its
] superior.  Also for resilience, it is necessary that peers be able to
] (but not necessarily required to) carry the same set of keys.  For
] efficiency reasons, a member of the heirarchy should hold not only the
] public keys for which it has direct responsibility, but also a cache
] of recently requested keys.  The size of this cache should be
] site-dependent and may be zero if required.

A requirement for an email interface:

] 
] Access to the distributed key service must be possible by electronic
] mail in a manner similar to that used by the present key servers.  Not
] all machines requiring PGP keys are capable of using other forms of
] access.

In addition to email, other mechanisms *may* be desirable; some of them
*may* enable PGP to perform a non-local real time search.

] 
] it may be appropriate, and further investigation is needed here, for
] other access methods to be introduced.  If it is possible for a
] program to interrogate a server in real time, as is possible for host
] name/address lookups to be performed, it would then be possible for a
] PGP implementation to fetch the public key as required.  Per-user
] public key rings would become unnecessary in this context, apart from
] their possibly greater efficiency of access or to override temporarily
] the global information.

Note, that per-user public key rings were described as unnecessary.
With a pedantic re-reading of the paragraph, I am convinced that what I
said was correct.  However, I phrased it extremely badly.  Although one
*could* rely solely on the global keyring; in practice one would
probably rather use a personal key ring under some circumstances.  I
hinted at my preferred ordering (personal, system, global) of keyrings
in the last phrase of the above.

] 
] To forestall certain attacks, it must be possible to create
] ex-directory public keys, with the ex-directory flag protected by the
] corresponding secret key to prevent unauthorized modification.  Such
] public keys would never be stored in a key server which adheres to the
] standard behaviour.


No-one, so far as I can tell, has commented at all on this final
paragraph.  Does no-one see the need for ex-directory keys?

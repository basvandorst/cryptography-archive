There have been a number of messages coming across the net referring to
problems with PGP v2.3.  Versions 2.0, 2.1 and 2.2 were all signed by
Branko Lankester whose key was certified by Phil Zimmermann whose key
I know firsthand is valid.

Before I switch to v2.3 I would have to know it was a bonafide release.
Perhaps someone could shed a little light on this subject for us all.  After
all, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.

Please post any comments you may have regarding this topic.

John

  Does anyone know of a general solution to the following
problem:
	Given a known plaintext, a known encryption algorithm,
and an unknown key, how would one simplify the process of trying
to
find examples of ciphertext from that plaintext in a large
quantity of data?  Assume that the encryption is a form of
polyalphabetic cipher.

This has piqued my curiosity...  Thanks for any answers!

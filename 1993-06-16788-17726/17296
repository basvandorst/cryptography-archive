For a historical note on one-time-pads for speech communications, 
refer to Project X in "A HISTORY OF ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE IN 
THE BELL SYSTEM:  NATIONAL SERVICE IN WAR AND PEACE (1925-1975)", 
M. D. Fagen, editor, ISBN 0-932764-00-2, LCCCN 75-31499.

Project X was a WW2 system which employed vocoders designed
using analog filter banks and relay A/D convertors.  The
digitized speech signal was modularly added to digital one-time-pads
cut into pairs of phonograph records using synchronized
lathes.  Radio modems were used to send the signals between
Roosevelt-Churchill and Roosevelt-MacArthur.  The records were
sent by courier.

Of note is table 5-5, page 297, which lists 32 patents filed
between 9/24/41 and 3/20/47 and issued between 3/6/62 and
11/9/76.  E.g. patent 3,991,273, R. C. Mathes, filed 10/4/43, issued
11/9/76 covers the system.  Makes you wonder what's still
on the shelf.

Using current technology, you should be able to replicate this
system for under $5K per end.  It would also take a lot less power
and be a lot easier to operate!

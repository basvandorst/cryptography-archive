There is another side to this.. If you just want to verify the signature on
a message then you need to have a cert for the sender signed by someone you
trust. In PEM there is a strict Hierachy that means that you only have to
have a few top certs to validate the sigs of all PEM mail (IPRA and PCA's)

PGP does suffer from this lack of structure.

To send encrypted mail then you do need a directory service. Whether it is
DNS or X500 depends on your local setup. (There are finger type accesses to
X500 directories appearing)

Be aware that it isn't quite as good as it might first look. There is 
nothing to say that you absolutely need to be able to compute d in 
order to be able to solve the cryptanalysis problem for RSA. 

i.e. You might still be able to compute the eth root of any ciphertext and
have no way to compute d (as far as I can see).

However, I think it is somewhat significant in that it might give one
a little more "faith" in RSA.

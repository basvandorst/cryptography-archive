   I'm a DES/Clipper novice also, but what prevents this scenario:

It appears to me that the two proposed "backdoor" codes to be embedded in
the Clipper chip / chipset would have no effect upon this artifice.  Of
course I assume that the originator's and recipient's computers are either
very fast or very patient, or both, but what's wrong with this scenario?
Am I missing something VERY basic here??

All I know about cryptology I learned from Arthur Conan Doyle's story 
"The Adventure of the Dancing Men."

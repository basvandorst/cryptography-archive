Quite true... but not *military* sytems surely :-)

Irony aside, this is the rub of it, isn't it? The theory and basic tools to 
construct a solid OTP system are quite accessible; nevertheless few use them
 if they can possibly get away with anything else. Perhaps its because, in 
practice OTP is a pain in the butt?

By my understanding of the language, the strength i.e. the security of an 
encryption algorithm, is entirely unaffected by physical security or the 
lack of it. The strength of the encryption algorithm is but one of a matrix 
of measures necessary to assure the secure transmission and storage of 
information. The matrix is only as strong as its weakest part and at any time.
With a proper OTP system the strength of the algorithm should be perfect, but 
it is the only part of the system that is. Physical security will always 
present a challenge, but will not necessarily be a system's greatest 
vulnerability.

I suspect you're right, but I regret it.

When they occur, I follow them humbly as best I am able. I drive the racing 
cars rather than build them :)

So, I hope, do most of us, Amanda,. It's why we keep coming back for more, 
isn't it?

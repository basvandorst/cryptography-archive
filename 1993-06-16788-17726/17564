Neal Koblitz's book, _A Course in Number Theory and Cryptography_,
includes a chapter, "Eliptic Curves" and a subchapter, "Eliptic
Curve Cryptosystems." A Fermat theorem is mentioned in the book,
but it is, alas, Fermat's Little Theorem. (a^p= a mod p if p is prime.)

I haven't read this chapter nor do I know much about the result
from Princeton, but if someone knows of any confluence between
eliptic curve crypto-systems and this result I would hope that
they would chime in.

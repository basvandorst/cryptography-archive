  Since there has been no "overt act" to boycott Dr. Denning's works, and
such an act would not be illegal or immoral even if it were to occur, you
violate your own criterion.

  In order for the State to achieve the purpose of Clipper (to maintain the
maximum possible ability to monitor people's communications), it -must-
lead to that.  One might as well object to an attempt to prevent a murderer
from pulling the trigger, on the ground that the proper time to act is just
before the bullet enters the victim's head.

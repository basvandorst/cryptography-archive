According to my oppinion, nowadays it is much easier to develop
strong cryptosystem than in 19th century. I believe it is difficult
to make fast system which can be easily implemented in hardware and strong.
But if you don't matter spending few billions machine operations on encryption
of file around 1MB, than I think, it's not very difficult to make
an algorithm based on pseudorandom generators, which is so complicated
that detailed mathematical analysis of it is enormously difficult and
the brute force search is impossible even with machines 10^20 times faster
than the today ones.
Well, I tend to think my program is secure. I have posted it
in sci.crypt approx. 2 weeks ago.
I would be pleased if you look at it and find a way how to crack it 
having few ciphertexts corresponding to different plain texts encrypted
each with a different password.
I would be pleased even more, if you don't find a way ...

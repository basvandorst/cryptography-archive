[ explaination of how the 10,000 CD pad is insecure ]

Wouldn't it be a lot easier and more secure to just generate your own
CD's with WORM technology, using some sort of thermal noise device to make
truely random bits, then give a copy to whomever you wanted to communicate
with?  A friend of mine outlined a strategy for doing this on a NeXT that
seemed pretty simple, even using it for voice messages rather than email

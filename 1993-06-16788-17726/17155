This is now public knowledge.  A member of the IBM design team for DES stated 
some time ago in this very newsgroup that they know about differential 
cryptanalysis at the time, and specifically constructed the S-boxes and key 
schedule in DES so as to render it no more effective than a brute-force 
attack.

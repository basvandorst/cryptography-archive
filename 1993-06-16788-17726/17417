   Let me elaborate: the only "problem" I have with PGP key distribution is the

   of the DNS.



Round and round in circles....


This last comment is exactly what started off this entire thread when I
posted the first article almost three weeks ago.


What we need, I believe, is to thrash out an equivalent of the DNS for
PGP keys.  This equivalent may, or may not, be layered on the existing
DNS according to its suitability.

Ideas, anyone?

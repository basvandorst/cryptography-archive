The message below suggests that even if the NSA is rather inefficient (and
from everything I've heard, as an analytic and technical organization they
are super-efficient), they'd have the funds to quietly hire a lot of boy
mathematical geniuses fresh out of school and train them in crypto R&D.
Given that, if (for example) a breakthrough in factoring is possible and
would vitiate (say) RSA, I would not bet my money against the NSA doing it.

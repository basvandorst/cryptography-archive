I know this discussion has died down so the point may be merely
academic, but I should relay a comment I heard at the CPSR
Cryptography conference in Washington DC earlier this month.

According to Dan Cook, of the US Department of State, Office of Defense
Trade Controls [who administer the ITARs], "There are currently no
restrictions on the permanent import of cryptography".

This was a direct quote, which we had him repeat to make sure we had
gotten it right.

I hope this settles this question. Eh, Dave?

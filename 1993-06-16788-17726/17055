Thank you all for answering my question, many by email.  Let me add a
response from Taneli Huuskonen <huuskone@cc.helsinki.fi> I found helpful:

"Nondeterminism can be thought of as an ability to make best possible
guesses: to factor a number nondeterministically, you guess the factors,
then multiply them together and check that the result is correct.  Put
another way, a yes-no-question is in NP if a proof of a "yes" answer can
be verified by a polynomial time algorithm.  Note that there is an
asymmetry here: it is irrelevant if there is a proof for a negative
answer, checkable in polynomial time."

Thanks again.

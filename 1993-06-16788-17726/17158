I must hasten to add that I do not personally suggest or endorse a
boycott of Dr. Denning's book.  My article was strictly in response to
David Sternlight's accusation of ``bookburning.'' I do not myself
consider boycotts on this level to be useful political tools, and
would suggest that your interests are better served by reading the
book and thus knowing your enemy (although the book is mostly
technical anyway).

In any case, David Sternlight's accusation that any legal political
action taken against Dr. Denning or any other individual because of
the opinions they hold and actively promote is tantamount to
bookburning and even Nazi-style persecution, remains ludicrous and a
prime example of the common observation that any Usenet discussion
which mentions ``Nazis'' or ``Hitler'' has sunk to the level of pure
noise.

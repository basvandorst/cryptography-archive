Finding the vertices of the convex hull of a set of n points in R^5.
A lower bound on the complexity of this problem is \Omega (n^4) time.
Maybe a crypto system could be based on Alice and Bob knowing where
not to look for extreme points or something.  The message could be
the number of vertices in the hull, or the "volume" of it, or whatever.

I think you'll find many problems in computational geometry whose 
complexities increase as the dimension of the space increases.

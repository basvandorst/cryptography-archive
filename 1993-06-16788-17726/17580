Dan Cook used to handle crypto for DTC. A few months ago DTC shuffled 
its employees around---something about ``diversity''---so he doesn't 
handle crypto any more. Whether his statement is ``authoritative''
depends on what you mean by authority.

(Cook is, in fact, right, and Bidzos is wrong; but does Sternlight care 
about the facts?)

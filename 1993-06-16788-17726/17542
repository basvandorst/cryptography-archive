Given the seriousness of this issue, I'd take it as indicative but not
authoritative until we know what Dan Cook's position there is, and if he
speaks with authority. The reason I'm nervous about this kind of hearsay
from someone I don't know is that Jim Bidzos told me the opposite.

Perhaps you could supply Cook's position and address. I'd be willing to
write him a letter, just to set my own mind at rest, and report the results.

If it's true, then there is no reason other than the work involved that we
can't have a "legal" version of "something" in the U.S. that would be fully
compatible with PGP. If the above report is accurate, there's no problem
importing IDEA. Bidzos has said he'd give permission for using RSAREF
provided the license terms were observed.

Who knows, perhaps we might end up with a version of RIPEM that speaks both
original Ripem (RSA+DES) and PGP (RSA+IDEA). Perhaps a separate and
non-infringing US-PGP package will make its appearance even sooner. One can
but hope. As I've said many times, I like PGP a lot (as I do RIPEM), and my
concerns have been about legal issues in the U.S.

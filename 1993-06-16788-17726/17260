   No.  Require that all surveillance warrants be published within one week
of their expiration OR within one year, except where to do so might jeopardize
national security; and present a list of topics explicitly naming what
subjects might jeopardize security, such as arms sales to foreign nationals,
items related to nuclear materials, etc; and present a list of topics which
explicitly do NOT jeopardize security, such as drug dealing, discussion of
cryptology, etc.  Ensure that the rules require that the warrants be
published in a widely-read newspaper or journal which is inexpensively
available to the general public in the area in which the warrants applied
(e.g., the Chicago Tribune, not the local paper that's read only by
attorneys and quite expensive and only available by subscription).  Require
that they be published for an entire week in a prominent section of the paper
(e.g., Legal Notices in the want-ads).  Require that FOIA requests for copies
of the warrants after expiration ALWAYS be honored, at reasonable cost.
   In short, do everything possible to make sure the information is available
to the party who was under surveillance, without his having to jump hoops to
get it.

   Chicago's big sting operation of a few years back showed that judges are
able to get away with fixing cases for years and years without detection.

   It's not inconceivable that such a system could be put in place here in
the States.

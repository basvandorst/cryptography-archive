1) The NIST announcement specifically states that Clipper
   looks for superencryption of the Law Enforcement Block.

2) This would only work for files. You would have to wire
   two RSA chips into your clipper-circuit for this to
   work with voice. If someone were marketing an RSA
   chip right now capable of the same bandwidth as Clipper, 
   we wouldn't be so pissed about Clipper. :-)

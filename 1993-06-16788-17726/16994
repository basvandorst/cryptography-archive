David Vincenzetti of Italy has been distributing PGP to many U.S. sites, 
ver U.S. networks, for free---no charge. Look for pub/security/pgp* on
ghost.dsi.unimi.it. He is not guilty of any crime, and nobody has sued
him for infringing copyrights or patent rights or any other rights. The
facts of this situation contradict Sternlight's claim.

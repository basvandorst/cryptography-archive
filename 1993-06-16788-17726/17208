My old communications textbook specifies a basic voice line as
having an attentuation distortion of:

  -2.5 dB from 500-2500 Hz
  -3.5 dB from 300-3000 Hz

and a envelope delay distortion of 1750 usec over the range 800-2600.
I don't want to bother computing the number of bits required to meet
this specification, but it is certainly much more that 4800/second.

I think you're confusing the Nyquist frequency (which applies to _analog_
signals) with ability to transfer _digital_ data.

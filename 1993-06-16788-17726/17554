	Depending on the leased lines, Cylink sells encrypting CSU/DSUs
that will handle speeds between 56k and T3. That's a pretty nice solution
because it doesn't mean you have to mess with applications or protocols,
as long as you own both ends of the leased line.

	Standard disclaimer: I don't work for Cylink, this is not an
advertisement. There may be other products out there that do this kind
of stuff, I'm just describing one that I happen to know about.

I fully agree. I make large use of PGP and I send and receive lots of
encrypted mails every week. Anyway I get somewhat annoyed when someone
sends me an encrypted message which contains no real confidential data
i.e. just to test my public key: by decrypting a single message I
potentially expose my secret key. I'm root on my system and I keep
a checksum for all binaries and all libries and all sensitive files
on all the systems I administrate, anyway there still to many ways a key
can be stolen on a multiuser system.

I got a 48SX. It's definitely too slow.

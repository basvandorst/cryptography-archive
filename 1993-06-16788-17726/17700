Documents may be subpoenaed, including encrypted documents.  This
certainly includes documents stored in electronic form on disk-drives,
backup-media, etc.  What may not be subpoenaed is something requiring
the testimony of an accused.  Basically, testimony is something said
or written on the specific request of prosecutors -- while anything
said or written previously, for other reasons, may be subpoenaed if a
record of it exists on some media (writing paper, tape-recording,
floppy-disk, etc.).  This is all pretty simple; but I just want to
make it clear.  For example, if the cops think you might have written
down your password somewhere, they can possibly get a warrant for a
search of all the written documents in your house -- but they can't
require you (short of rubber-hose methods) to testify to your
password, nor even to the location of its written version.

In another example of sorts:  If my PGP encrypted messages were
suspected of containing evidence of criminal activity, the cops could
subpoena and sieze my hard-drive, on which PGP is installed (actually,
they'd certainly take the whole computer, and probably all the
peripherals down to the surge suppressor and software manuals -- but
that's a different issue).  However, after this siezure, they could
not require me to testify to the IDEA password used to encrypt my
secret-key internally.  This siezure would do them some good,
actually, since like many PGP users (I'm certain), I'm foolish enough
to use english words as my password (But who could really remember a
password like "M/h7LPZumnjE18/hIU3DNIusCIgIqt7MD27"?).  Even assuming
IDEA itself is secure, this narrows down the keyspace quite a bit for
a brute-force attack.  But the cops would still be required to make
such a brute-force attack themselves, at whatever computation cost it
actually had.

While I certainly agree with you about the problems of key-escrow,
it's not encrypted files themselves which are covered by the Fifth
amendment, as discussed above.

While I agree that Gordievsky was referring to traffic using a stronger
encryption technique than DES, I fail to understand why you claim that
it was "more likely" this traffic used a version of Capstone (or Skipjack
or whatever the correct name is this week).

Unless, of course, you have a security clearance which not only allows you
to know what encryption technique is used for diplomatic traffic, but also
to reveal that knowledge to the general public.  :-)

(P.S., I'm ignoring the "or a one-time system" bit because while this
is a strong possibility, it has no bearing on the discussion of the
weakness of either DES or Capstone/Skipjack).

The almost universal response to the Clipper implementation programme has been
a fear that the government of the USA intends to prevent US citizens from
communicating privately to each other over the telephone.  My worry would be
that the US government plan to systematize keeping *all* *government*
communications secret from the *people*.

I live, and am a citizen of, the UK.  I do not commit any actions that I wish
to hide from from fellow citizens.  My government, however, *does*.  That is
why I do not really understand your reaction.  After all, if you *really*
had a secret, you wouldn't transmit it down the phone anyway would you?

If the CIA or the FBI or whoever want to know what you say (for example) they
need only mike up your house or listen in with directional microphones.

If you're so worried about it, why not discuss means of evading a blanket
ban on non-Clipper crypto?  Or do you, rightly, fear an investigation from
some agency if you do?  The fact that agencies probably read this forum
and whatch out for 'subversives' / 'un-Americans' or whatever would worry
me far more than some Clipper chip which on the face of it is better than
the current non-Crypto telephones.

Just my penn'orth

Tony.

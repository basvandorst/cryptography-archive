Don't know about Thomas J; but there's case-law on how George
Washington acted on cryptology issues in David Kahn's "the 
Codebreakers" (hardcover edition only). To make a long story
short, a senior Continental-Army officer was caught sending
encrypted mail to an address behind the British lines. He claimed
it's all innocent, but wouldn't decypher. The case was left
on hold until someone decrypted the mail, proving the guy
a traitor.

Hope this helps

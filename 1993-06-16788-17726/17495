I remember reading somewhere that Benoit Mandelbrot was looking into the
form of transmission line noise when he was first formulating his ideas on
chaos. IBM's typical response to line noise was to send someone out with a
screwdriver to fix it. Mandelbrot conjectured that the noise was inevitable
(and chaotic in form).

Does anyone have any further info on this?

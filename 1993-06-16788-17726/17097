.And so it appears that another patent jewel will be added to the crown
.worn by PKP, the de facto owner of cryptographic technology in the United
.States.  They will have an exclusive license to the DSA, as they already
.do to RSA and most other worthwhile encryption technologies.

I think this is quite rational act from PKP. Their RSA patent will
expire in January 2001. If they promote DSA and everyone starts using
it, they still exist after that time.

For whatever the datapoint means, I personally know one specialist in
algebraic geometry who left a faculty position to take an offer from the
NSA - in 1976 or so.  The NSA has been interested in this area for a LONG
time (from which one can reach the conclusion ... that they've been interested
for a long time.  Where they've gotten, who can say.)

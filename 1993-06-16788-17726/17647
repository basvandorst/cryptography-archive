Since any reference to my report have disappeared out of the
references to Niels Ferguson's article (I guess it must be a bug in
bibtex, so perhaps Niels should use a different version when he starts
doing his master's thesis), I hereby post a (modified) repost of an
article I posted almost two and a half months ago on sci.crypt.


	PRIVACY-PROTECTING OFF-LINE ELECTRONIC CASH SYSTEMS
        ___________________________________________________

I recently (Official date March 1993, appeared April 12 with a few
typos removed) published a new privacy-protecting off-line electronic
cash system as a technical report at CWI. I am a PhD-student at David
Chaum's cryptography-group, and our group has a long history of
research in the field of privacy-protecting cash systems.

The electronic version of the report is called CS-R9323.ps.Z, contains
77 pages, and can be retrieved from

ftp.cwi.nl   (192.16.184.180)

from the directory pub/CWIreports/AA.
The postscript-file is suitable for 300dpi laserprinters.

TITLE   :  An Efficient Off-line Electronic Cash System Based On The 
           Representation Problem

DESCRIPTION (modified): Many privacy-protecting off-line electronic
cash systems have been proposed over the last couple of years, most
building on the work of David Chaum and others. Systems have been
proposed that have a very high degree of PROVABILITY (e.g. the
signature scheme of the bank is secure against an adaptively chosen
message attack) but are (very) inefficient since they use theoretical
schemes for e.g.  multi-party computations.  These systems aim to
produce results similar to e.g. "a secure digital signature exists if
and only if trapdoor permutations exists" (a result of
Bellare/Micali). In this respect, I want to mention work of Damgard,
Pfitzmann and Waidner, De Santis et al., and Franklin and Yung.

Although it is important to know under what theoretical conditions
secure privacy-protecting off-line electronic cash systems exist, one
would want to have EFFICIENT systems. Recently, such a system was
proposed by Niels Ferguson (see his post). This system is quite
efficient, however it seems difficult to prove anything about its
security.

It is desirable to have systems that have both features, provability
and efficiency.  In my technical report, I describe a system that
indeed combines provable security (to a high extent) and efficiency.
It is based on a problem, called the representation problem, of which
little use has thus far been made in literature, in conjunction with
what I call a "restrictive" blind signature scheme. This approach
results in a cash system that not only can be proven secure to a very
high extend, but also is more efficient than the system described by
Ferguson. For example, storage space for a coin is 70 bytes (!), and
in order to make a payment, only two multiplications modulo a 140-bit
prime are required by the user, independent of the lengthe of the
challenge c of the shop -- in Ferguson's system, 250 bytes storage
space are needed, and more than 1.5 * |c| multiplications modulo a
512-bit composite are needed (e.g., over 45 for a 30-bit challenge)
for a payment.  In addition, our withdrawal protocol uses less
transmissions and only 4 numbers to be transmitted rather than 12 in
the system of Ferguson. 

Apart from provability and efficiency, there is one other important
feature one would like to have in electronic cash systems, namely
EXTENDIBILITY. In the inefficient but highly provably secure systems
mentioned above, this is very hard to achieve. The same holds for the
system of Ferguson. In addition, since the security of his basic
system cannot be proven, the same will certainly hold for any
extensions.  In contrast, the system I describe features the following
extensions:

* framing attempts of the bank (saying that a user double-spent a
  coin, whereas he did not) are prevented regardless of computational
  power, by a simple mechanism.  
* electronic checks; these can be achieved almost as efficiently as coins, 
  whereas they enable the user to spend any amount between, say,
  1 and 2^k dollars (for some arbitrary k).
* multi-spendable coins; coins can be spent k times (at the cost of 
  linkability but NOT traceability) in such a way that the storgae requirements
  of the user become k times as efficient.
* Anonymous accounts (i.e. in addition to anonymous payments). This level of 
  anonymity has not been achieved before. (not yet in report, but will be in 
  the Crypto 93 pre-proceedings)
* (perhaps the most interesting): The entire off-line cash system 
  (including all the extensions) can be incorporated in a setting based on 
  so-called wallets with observers (a user-module with embedded within it a 
  tamper-resistant module), which has the important advantage that 
  double-spending can be prevented, rather than detecting the identity of 
  a double-spender after the fact. In particular, it can be incorporated even 
  under the most stringent requirements conceivable about the privacy of the 
  user, which seems to be impossible to do with previously proposed systems.
  This important extension builds on the work of David Chaum and 
  Cramer/Pedersen. As a result, one can build an efficient, highly provably 
  secure off-line cash system with both security (prior restraint of 
  double-spending) and privacy (anonymous accounts) guaranteed to a higher 
  level than before.

In all the extensions, the efficiency is maintained (due to e.g.
vector addition chain techniques applicable to the representation
problem), and the proofs of security follow almost immediately from
that of the basic system. Moreover, a similar system can be based on
RSA; I will publish this soon.

I made a particular effort to keep the report as self-contained as
possible.  If you have any questions, please e-mail to me and I will
try to reply as well as I can. Any comments are also welcome!

   Could you define a "true" OTP system?  I've seen (in various books)
schemes like taking the first letter (or second, or third, etc.) of every
word in a certain book and using that as a OTP; random-number generators
with fresh seeds for each OTP; people sitting in a room and calling out the
first letter that comes to mind (a VERY bad scheme, IMHO, since it might
seem to generate digrams or trigrams); encrypting executable code with a
weak system to generate the OTP; taking a book on cryptology and using all
the cryptext shown anywhere as the OTP; all as methods of generating OTPs.
How exactly is a OTP really generated in a secure fashion?

I don't think this is at all correct. Depending on the escrow agencies, they
become YOUR agents, just as your bank is. Since you have prior knowledge
that they are YOUR agents for holding keys (assuming you accept the
voluntary Clipper deal), law enforcement still needs to serve specific
subpoenas on your agents to get the keys.

It would not be too far removed to suggest that an analogy with banks isn't
inappropriate. To get a bank account, you have to agree to the Federal
Reserve regulations as they affect that account, including any
record-keeping requirements with respect to your transactions, just as to
get Clipper you have to agree to the escrow regulations. The bank is your
agent, and you haven't been subpoenaed without evidence just because the
bank has your financial data. For law enforcement to get it takes a specific
subpoena.

Actually the situation with your bank account is worse--the bank must report
any deposit of $10000 or above in most categories to the Feds. You don't get
to do anything about that, and most people don't even know it happens. With
Clipper, the escrow agents don't have any role with respect to your
messages.

From my reading of both models, the PGP model is less extensive but more 
flexible in some ways.  I prefer the PEM model simply because it seems to 
automate more of the certificate-handling process.

Now, it is tautological that given any digital signature algorithm, you can 
construct certificates.  You could use a "web of trust" with PEM just as 
easily as with PGP.

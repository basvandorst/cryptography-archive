Yeah, I do.

I'm gung-ho for PGP, but the thought of crooks and political killers
using strong cryptography REALLY chills me.

Saddam can supply his little helpers in the west with hardware running
PGP type stuff that'll keep the FBI off their ass JUST long enough for
them to do something HORRIBLE.

Think of the world trade centre bombing. They're not ALL going to be
stupid, you know.

And when the kiddie diddlers get a grip on PGP they can lock their
boards up with it real good, youknowwhatImean?

Bikers run BBSs and trade drugs and strippers like cans of spam. They'll
lock THEIR boards up too.

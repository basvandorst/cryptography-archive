I think this is a misunderstanding - they're not detecting whether the
input data appears to have been encrypted, which isn't really feasible.

What the chip detects is whether somebody's messed with the wiretap block,
and the *eavesdroppers* can detect whether somebody's superencrypted it
for transmission (decrypting before feeding it back to the originating chip),
because they can decrypt the block using the Family Key and check its
internal checksums.

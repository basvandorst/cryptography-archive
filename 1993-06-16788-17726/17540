   Hmmm.  Even if no government but the US is able to access escrowed
keys in US-sold phones, the existence of foreign intelligence agencies
seems to endanger Clipper.  Surely, French intelligence, or even Abu
Nidal, can find *one* crooked police department/court, and get whatever
warrants are necessary.  Indeed, large criminal organizations and foreign
intelligence agencies are virtually *certain* to have people on the inside
of the FBI.  This seems *much* more theatening a weakness to me than
the threat of NSA leaving trapdoors in the Clipper algorithm.  (Probably,
this is true because I can't see the Clipper algorithm, and even if I
could, I doubt that *I* am going to catch the weakness that the whole
academic crypto community misses.)

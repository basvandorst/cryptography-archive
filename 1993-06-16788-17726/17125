Sorry about the cross-posting, but I did not know in which group this
would be most appropriate.

I'm have some questions regarding protocols for electronic meetings
over internet.

1) Is there an equivalent to _Robert's Rules of Order_ for e-mail and
networks?

2) Has there ever been a board meeting or shareholder's meeting held
over internet?  Are there any court cases regarding the legality of
such meetings?

3) How does one conducting voting over internet?  In particular (for
you sci.crypt folks) how would one conduct a secret ballot over
Internet?

Polynomial in  the size of the seed?  And for a given size problem, a
polynomial with large coefficients can be worse than an exponential with
small coefficients.  

Also, there is a problem with really long seeds.  Remember that to use
a one-time pad, both parties must have exactly the same one.  Now for
simulation purposes, I recommend really long seeds, in the tens of 
thousands of bits at least, but for those purposes, there is no secrecy. 
Thousand-bit secret seeds are quite fraught with danger; with a multi-
megabyte OTP, if a few bits are garbled, the encoding and decoding can
still be carried out, but if a few bits of the seed are garbled, the
next block can be hopeless.

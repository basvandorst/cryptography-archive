This is not true; a compression procedure to do this would be quite 
expensive.  If the characters under consideration have probabilities
around .4 and .6 of the mean, a compression procedure will leave it
alone, but its entropy of .97 is quite easily distinguished from 1.
My hasty calculations indicate that one would have a reasonable chance
of detecting this deviation in a 256 character set in 1000 characters.

And if we have a pseudo-random procedure of the form

	x[n] = x[n-460] XOR x[n-607]

there will be no information beyond the first 607 items, but I doubt if
a compression scheme will recognize that this has happened at all.  This
is an example of a type of pseudo-random procedure in general use.

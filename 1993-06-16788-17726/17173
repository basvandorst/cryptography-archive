... biggest, I think.  According to Gunter Ahrendt's survey, the NSA
has more Cray MIPS (uh, a little hand-waving here, I think the
benchmark was more weighted towards floating-point) than even Cray
has.  What do you suppose they do with all that horsepower?

Lessee...  A little image processing to enhance spy photos, a little
enhancement of captured sounds, a whole lot of classified weather
prediction?

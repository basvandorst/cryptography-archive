nic.funet.fi, or ftp.funet.fi.  I have been putting the crypt stuff
there, plus the ghost (in Italy) archive is mirrored to nic.funet.fi.

It looks like TIS/PEM has got something to do with RSADSI code, which
probably means it is not freely distributable.  Also a TIS/PEM release
notice I have seems to talk about a beta test period and "agreement"
between the tester and TIS.  TIS and/or RSADSI probably hold copyright
to the code, which means it's not a good idea for nic.funet.fi to
distribute it.  TIS is apparently using the US/Canadian Internet users
as beta test users for its commercial software.  I have no problem
with that, but I don't see much reason to be enthusiastic about
TIS/PEM either.

I'd rather recommend people to use freely distributable software like
PGP - much less hassles.  Hopefully there will be free PEM
implementations for those who want to use PEM.

   This is not a flame.  What do you mean by ex-directory?  I'm afraid I don't
   see the concept...

Sorry.  Perhaps I used a phrase which is common in Britsh English, but
not in American.

In this country at least, it is possible for a telephone subscriber to
specify that the number not be listed in the public phone books.  The
phone company knows the number but refuses to divulge it.  The subscriber
then must give away the number to those he or she wishes to receive
calls from.

At Oxford University, we have ex-directory email addresses, for those
folk who wish not to receive unsolicited email.

I was suggesting that it be possible for a key to be marked in such a
way that a standard-following keyserver would refuse to store the key or
to pass it on to other servers.

Of course, it is always possible for malicious users of any system to
publish any ex-directory information to which thy get access.

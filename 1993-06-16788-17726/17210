At some point in the next 30 years, we're going to have one of

	1) optical computers, where computation is a transform
	on lasers passing through the glass.  A window is a teraflop.

	2) some variety of nano-box, or slightly bigger but
	still scary

	3) ???

and security-by-takes-a-long-time-to-factor will suddenly be bogus.
All those tapes of encrypted comms that the NSA, FBI, etc. makes
will suddenly be evidence, acceptable in court.  

Comments?  Strategies?

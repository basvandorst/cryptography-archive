Crypto proceedings for at least the last 5 years or so have been published by
Springer Verlag - part of their "silver and red" series.  The delay until
publication has varied - it depends partly on who is doing the editing.  The
Crypto 88 proceedings didn't appear until 1991 or so!  On the other hand, I
think the Crypto 89 proceedings appeared at about the same time.

I wouldn't bet on them being available sooner than 6 months after the confe-
rence, an probably not for quite a bit longer than that.

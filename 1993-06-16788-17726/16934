I fully agree. Dorothy Denning's technical credentials in cryptography
are impeccable. If I were to teach a college course on cryptography,
I'd probably use her book.

But as we've seen many times in history, having world-class talent in
one's own scientific field does not automatically endow one with
equally formidable talent, extraordinary insights or even basic common
sense, in other fields such as politics.  William Shockley
(co-inventor of the transistor) comes to mind.

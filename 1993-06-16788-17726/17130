Hold it.  The newspaper coverage of the Clipper proposal said that the
proposal also outlawed the use of other encryption technologies in
competing uses.  In other words, I get to choose between Clipper
phones and no encryption; I don't get to choose between clipper,
something else, and no encryption.

Did the newspapers get it wrong, or is Sternlight's "pick something
else" a cruel hoax?

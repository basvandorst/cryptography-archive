I am not sure of the exact resilleance clipper has against LEF tampering.
But it sounds like if one can trap any law enforcement authoritie's LEF, and
substitute for his/her's during transmission, there is a significant chance 
that one may earn surveillance immunity (sort of diplomatic immunity!).

Next concern is a privacy issue.  Could not one adapt the clipper format to 
achieve caller ID reporting, even where prohibited otherwise.

Just for the brain feeder's.

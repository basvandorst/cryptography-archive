Yeah!  And what exactly do you mean by "IBM" and "Xerox"?  Are you implying
that all IBM and Xerox employees are cryptographers?

The guy from Berkeley is exactly right!  How dare you use an idiom
that everybody understands but which is actually logically wrong!

..Oh dear!  I should have said 'everybody who speaks English' ..I
mean, 'everybody who speaks English and reads sci.crypt' ..I mean,
'everybody who speaks English and understands idioms and reads
sci.crypt' ...I mean, 'everybody who speaks English and reads
sci.crypt and understands idioms and happened to read that particular
posting'...I mean 'most people who speak English and read sci.crypt
and understand idioms and happened to read that particular posting'...

;-)

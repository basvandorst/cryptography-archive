This seems self-evident to you (as it does to me). So why is it so
hard to also agree that it's also quite right for individual American
citizens to not trust the NSA to protect their interests? On general
political principles, the NSA's primary function is to protect its
own interests (i.e, existence, the first rule of any bureaucracy)
and those in power in the government. As long as these interests mesh with
those of the individual American, fine; but watch out when they don't.

The administration also uses France as an example of a government that
(theoretically) restricts the private, domestic use of cryptography,
apparently as some sort of precedent for doing the same in the US.
Hmmm...

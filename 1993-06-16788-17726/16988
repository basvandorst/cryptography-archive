Following is a copy of the current TIS/PEM license.  It is much less
restrictive than the old beta-test license that others have
referenced.

			     TIS/PEM (TM)
   Internet Reference Implementation of Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM)

		  Trusted Information Systems, Inc.
			     June 2, 1993


This document is copyrighted by (C) 1993 Trusted Information Systems,
Inc.  License is granted to reproduce, copy, post, or distribute in
any manner, provided that this document is kept intact and that no
modifications, deletions, or additions are made.


WHAT IS IT?

RSA Data Security, Inc., and Trusted Information Systems, Inc., are
pleased to provide TIS/PEM, a reference implementation of Privacy
Enhanced Mail (PEM).  In order to foster acceptance of PEM and
provide the community with a usable, working version of this
technology, TIS/PEM is being made available for broad use on the 
following basis.

TIS/PEM is distributed in source code form, with all modules written
in the C programming language.  It runs on many UNIX derived platforms,
including BSD, System V, NeXT, and ULTRIX.  It is currently integrated 
with the following user interfaces: Version 6.7 of the Rand MH Message 
Handling system, XMH, and MH under Emacs.

TIS/PEM is a product of Trusted Information Systems, Inc. and is made
available with the cooperation of RSA Data Security, Inc.


WHAT YOU CAN (AND CANNOT) DO WITH TIS/PEM

The license at the end of this note gives legal terms and conditions.
The following is the layman's interpretation, for information only and
with no legal weight.

1. TIS/PEM is for sending and receiving Privacy Enhanced Mail.  It is
   not to be utilized in any form or for any purpose other than to
   send and receive Privacy Enhanced Mail.  Other than the restriction
   that the code is to be used for Privacy Enhanced Mail, there is no
   limitation on the purposes for which it may be employed.  It is
   specifically intended that TIS/PEM be used to protect the full
   range of electronic mail transactions.  In particular, users are
   encouraged to use it for research, education, commercial, and
   personal transactions.

2. TIS/PEM includes RSAREF, a cryptography package supplied by RSA
   Data Security, Inc.  This license is granted by TIS with the
   permission of RSADSI and applices to the combination of TIS/PEM
   with RSAREF.  It does not extend to other uses of RSAREF or to
   RSAREF by itself.  This scope is broader than the license which
   covers RSAREF alone.  For other uses of RSAREF, contact RSADSI
   directly.

3. You can distribute TIS/PEM freely within your organization under
   the same terms and conditions as the TIS/PEM license.  You cannot
   distribute TIS/PEM outside of your organization.  This restriction
   is intended to avoid inclusion of TIS/PEM as part of a commercial
   offering.  TIS/PEM and its documentation may not be incorporated
   into any program, other product, or any service that is sold, or
   for which any revenue or other consideration is received.

4. TIS/PEM may be used with certificates issued within the Internet
   certificate hierarchy or with certificates outside of this
   hierarchy.  In either case, users are responsible for the trust
   invested in any certificate.  The mechanisms provided in this
   implementation support the trust model defined in RFC 1422 and also
   permit other trust models to be employed.  Similarly, this code
   supports the use of distinguished names as described in RFC 1422,
   but it also permits the use of distinguished names that are aligned
   with electronic mail addresses.

5. The certificate issuing facilities of TIS/PEM may be used to issue
   certificates within your own organization.  You cannot issue
   certificates to persons or entities outside of your organization.
   
6. You can modify TIS/PEM as required to port it to other operating
   systems and compilers.  Any such modification is subject to the
   terms of this license.  TIS requests, but does not require, that
   you give TIS a copy of the changes.

7. You can not send TIS/PEM outside the United States or Canada, nor
   can you give it to anyone who is not a U.S. or Canadian citizen and
   does not have a U.S. "green card."  (These are U.S. State and
   Commerce Department requirements because RSA and DES are
   export-controlled technologies.)

8. As with any system involving cryptography, there are certain risks
   which are inherent.  Users are particularly cautioned that the
   security of their mail depends in part on unpredictability of the
   keys and on the protection of private keys.  Both of these matters
   are dependent on the execution environment, which is outside the
   control of this code.  TIS assumes no liability for any flaws in
   the security of this system.  System Administrators and Users are
   referred to the documentation for further guidance.


USERS' GROUP

TIS maintains the electronic-mail users' group <tispem-users@tis.com>
for discussion of TIS/PEM.  To join, send electronic mail to
<tispem-users-request@tis.com>.

TIS/PEM technical questions, license issues, bug reports, etc. should
be addressed to <tispem-support@tis.com>.


CERTIFICATE REGISTRATION


Users or groups who wish to use TIS/PEM with certificates that are
part of the Internet certificate hierarchy should contact the
appropriate certificate authority.  Organizations wishing to issue
certificates to their users should contact a Policy Certification
Authority (PCA).  Both TIS and RSADSI operate PCAs.  For information
on TIS's PCA, please send mail to <tispca-info@tis.com>.  For
information on RSADSI's PCA, please send mail to <pca-info@rsa.com>.

Some people have been asking about the strength of two key triple DES.
Is it as strong as a version of DES with 112 bit keys?

The answer is no.  Oorschot and Weiner published a known-plaintext
attack on two key triple encryption.  It requires 2^(120-lg(n))
operations and n words of memory, where n is the number of available
plaintext-ciphertext pairs.  This attack is still impractical, though;
they estimate that given n=2^32, $1 billion worth of hardware (50
million chips) would take 2.5*10^12 years to produce a solution.  This
is four orders of magnitude better than brute force, though.

Andrew.

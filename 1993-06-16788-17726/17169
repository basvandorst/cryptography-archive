Yes, Mr. Sternlight, words do fail you -- as also, apparently, do
concepts.  You criticize Mr. May simply for expressing a political
opinion which is non-State-approved; without thereby apparently being
able to criticize its content.  There is simply no similarity between
Mr. May asking people to consider the effect of their purchasing
decision re. Dr. Denning's book, and any official gov't action
prohibiting the sale or existence of certain books.  Nor even is there
any similarity even if Mr. May and I were to form the "Committee to
boycott Denning's Books" (or whatever name you like).  A private group
does not force or compell anyone to follow it's political beliefs and
decisions simply by holding them (unless it resorts to extortion,
intimidation, and violence -- none of which Mr. May suggested doing...
I don't think he would advocate Operation Rescue type tactics of
screaming obcenities at buyers outside cryptography bookstores, for
example).  If Mr. May were to be elected to State office, then use
that position to boycott Denning, that would be quite a different
matter -- but it's also quite a BIG 'if'.

   In some very interesting messages, it has been suggested that shorter RSA

   keys are probably still safe.

   Are 1024 bit RSA keys practical for real-time speech? No cheating--i.e.
   vocoders that sound artificial, etc. Could AT&T market 1024 bit RSA phones
   as easily and cheaply as Clipper (assuming the $25 per Clipper chip reported
   earlier)? Would they sound "normal"? (I'm thinking of widespread use, not
   "special" high-security phones where people might be willing to put up with
   lowered quality.)

You're mixing up which encryption algorithms get used for which functions;
while it might be possible to use pure RSA with long keys for voice encryption
(since you only need ~10 kb/s throughput), it would take a lot of horsepower,
which means a lot of bucks, and you'd also have to do RSA key distribution.  
SkipJack-based systems also need to solve key distribution; 
the MYK-78 doesn't provide any, though Capstone does.

A much more reasonable design would use Diffie-Hellman for key exchange 
(though you could use RSA), and then do the actual encryption with a
software implementation of triple-DES for paranoids
(or IDEA if they want similar security and better performance.) 
(It's probably worth doing triple-DES instead of single-DES if you're
trying to design a standard that will be around for >10 years.)
Even triple-DES doesn't require significant horsepower at
voice-encryption speeds, compared to voice coding effort;
the crypto becomes a few percent extra load on the DSP and a bit more
firmware, but minimal extra hardware cost.


Diffie-Hellman offers a few advantages over RSA for phones and faxes -
there's no key distribution required, and there's no master key
sitting around to allow messages to be decrypted later.
It has one major disadvantage, which is that it can be spoofed by an
active eavesdropper sitting in the middle replacing messages,
unless you do additional work to verify that it's not being done,
like reading half-keys out loud for voice systems, or using separately
distributed keys to do some kind of signature.  The half-key business
isn't very useful for faxes, since they use standard protocols and
simple message formats which a computer can fake much more easily than voice.
Of course, your Diffie-Hellman keys have to be long enough also,
otherwise anybody who can afford to break DES can break them.

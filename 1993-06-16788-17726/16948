I took this book out of the library after I got my first copy of PGP
because it was listed in the PGP docs as a good place to start learning
about cryptography.  I found it to be a straightforward and accessible text.

I don't know if Prof. Denning is a brilliant cryptographic researcher or
not, but I think anyone who reads her book would have to concede that
she's got a pretty good handle on the subject.

I don't agree with her views on how much access the public ought to have
to cryptography, and I don't believe the kinds of restrictions people have
discussed imposing on crypto technology are practical or enforcable.  That
is to say, I don't believe that it is possible to prevent organized
criminals or drug cartels from getting access to crypto softare.  Think of
all the problems we have with preventing drugs from entering our country; 
it will be much harder to stop the flow of sotware products.  Crypto
technology is really just ideas, and I don't see how we can prevent people
from getting ahold of ideas, regardless of the potential those ideas might
have for facilitating crime.

I feel that we, as citizens of democracies, have the right to private
communications.  I use PGP for much of my own mail.  But that doesn't mean
that the concerns of people who worry about the effect of secure
communications on law enforcement are paranoid or right wing wackos. 

This technology *will* cause problems.  I just don't think there is very
much that government can do about it, and if that's the case, I don't want
to surrener my rights to privacy to a futile law enforcement campaign.

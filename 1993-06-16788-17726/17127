 Well (you can ignore everything I say if you like, me being British)
surely that must be their motive because surely no government would be stupid 
enough to think that criminals would use a communication system that was 
inherently unsafe, right? So in that case, there's no need for them to have a 
backdoor, right? So why *do* they have a backdoor? Are they intending to outlaw
other communication systems? Doesn't that violate one or two of your 
Amendments? Doesn't the whole thing seem inherently suspicious to you? Why not?

 Well, someone did mention 'back-to-back' cracking, ie:

Your Clipper->Unspecified agency Clipper placed in the line->Intended recipient
                   diverting signal,then re-coding it

 which an awful lot of cryptographic schemes are vunerable to (see RSA).

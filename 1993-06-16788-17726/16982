So the government gets to market test their schemes on a "voluntary"
basis, but acts to prevent others in the private sector who wish to do
the same?  Why is it that we cannot buy cellular phones with strong
encryption?  Not because industry doesn't want to build them.  Not
because there is no perceived demand by the cellular phone vendors for
such products.  Because they are not allowed to be built and exported.
Market oriented, indeed.

If the "test marketing" of the government's scheme doesn't work out so
well, then they just declare the rest of the market (and competition)
illegal?  (An option "we still have on the table.")  Voluntary?

You know, I really think that we should just leave this point out of
any arguments we make.  You make an a priori assumption that there are
"law enforcement needs", and most folks just don't agree with this
point.  I am still permitted to whisper when I have a conversation with
someone in private, aren't I?

The fundamental problem is the fact that the govenment, which works
FOR me is imposing unpopular policies and telling me that I'll just
have to live with it.  I think reaction to this "Clipper" proposal has
demonstrated that it is not consistant with needs and desires of many
folks.  How many?  I dunno; perhaps we can "hold our breath" until the
next election and see.

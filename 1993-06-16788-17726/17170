Hi there,

I am looking for an efficient algorithm to solve the congruence

       2
      x  = a (mod p) 

where "=" stands for the \equiv-symbol and p is an odd prime. If
p=3 (mod 4), things are easy:
                                             (p-1)/2
       a is a quadratic residue (mod p), so a        = 1 (mod p),

        2             (p-1)/2      (p+1)/2      2(p+1)/4
  =>   x  =  a  =  a a         =  a         =  a         (mod p)

             (p+1)/4             (p+1)/4
  =>   x =  a          or x = - a        (mod p).

What can be done if p = 1 (mod 4)?


Thanks in advance

   Stefan

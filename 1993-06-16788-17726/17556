It would be useful for this part to be elaborated. One of the beliefs I have
about Clipper is that it is designed, absent the key escrow aspect, to
frustrate current attacks by "determined and well-funded adversaries." Thus
alternatives for this purpose are of high interest to some. Is there some
way to describe, even impressionistically, what level of adversary this
proposal would be effective against in "real life situations."

Putting it another way, if I assume the French cryptologic service can break
PGP, does this proposal affect that capability in any way? (I accept the
assertion that it does not weaken PGP and thus is neutral or better in the
face of those who cannnot currently break PGP.)

Note that this is a technical, not a political question, and I'm asking for
a technical, not a political response.

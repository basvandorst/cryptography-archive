Huh? Can someone else explain to me where this came from????
How could he have found a contrary case when it was just proved that
there are none???? Who was this mathematician?? Where did you get the notion
that FLT had been shown to be false? What did you think all the current
celebration is about?


No insult intended, but you seem to be grossly misinformed.

:   The conjecture of Fermat that was confirmed has no real
:relevance to cryptography, as Mr. Silverman said.

How does this follow from your previous statements? Explain please.

	Sounds like the 3600. If we're talking about the same thing,
one phone jack goes to the telephone body and the other the handset.
So it acts as a "bump on the wire" with the phone in the encrypted
stream.
	I believe it uses Clipper. The prototype version apparently
used DES but had their firmware upgraded.  ;)

        Is this not specifically the point; that, for cryptographic
        purposes, what is needed is an unpredictable number generator?

        There should be little argument that a noise-source random
        number generator is unpredictable. Is the converse necessarily
        true? Must an unpredictable number generator produce random
        numbers?

        Suppose we use a "sieve" algorithm to generate a number series
        as follows:

        1.  Set up the half dozen or so most powerful tests of
            randomness and combine them to produce an "Index of
            Randomness" Ir, such that a high Ir would generally be
            accepted as very convincing evidence of a noise source.

        2.  Starting with a many-number key as an initial series,
            extend the series by selecting successive numbers so that
            the series Ir is maximised.

        Clearly, this could be used for cryptography, because anyone
        with the many-number key could regenerate the entire series.

        Pattern? What pattern? Nothing detectable as a pattern could
        get by the most powerful tests of randomness, else we forgot
        one. Add it to the list.

        Is this series random, unpredictable, neither, both, or ??

        Cheers,
                Marc

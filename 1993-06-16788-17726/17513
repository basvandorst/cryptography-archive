The length of the algorithm is well-defined only relative to some arbitrary
but fixed computing scheme, e.g. PASCAL or a universal Turing machine.  The
word "arbitrary" in the preceding sentence means that randomness makes
sense only for infinite sequences, as you could rig the computing
environment so that any *particular* finite string is described by a
program of zero length.

So the formal definition applies to any infinite sequence, under any
arbitrary but fixed computing environment: a binary sequence is random if
the length of the shortest algorithm to generate the first  N bits is at
least N+c, for some constant c depending on the sequence.  It is a theorem
of Kolmogorov and Chaitin that this definition is independent of the choice
of computing scheme, i.e. it is an intrinsic characteristic of the sequence.

Pi, e, gamma, sqrt(2), etc  are thought to be normal, but nobody is even
close to having a proof.  The Chudnovksy brothers (mathematicians who
have computed billions of digits of pi and proved various transcendence
theorems about pi and other numbers) claim that proving properties of the
decimal expansion of pi  may not be as hard as one might think, because
such problems are "linear", i.e. one could conceivably exploit the
similarity between decimal expansions and power series.

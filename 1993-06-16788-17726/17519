This may or may not be the case.  But in any case, it is irrelevant for
the purposes of cryptography.  If we replace the first 10^(10^10) bits
of the sequence by 0, it is just as random by that definition.  But at
least according to the current versions of cosmology, our universe
will not last anywhere near long enough to look at that many bits.

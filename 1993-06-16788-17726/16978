It is a public key system.
The public key is m=p*q, where p and q are distict primes equal to
3 modulo 4.
To encrypt, pick a random number r,
generate the series r, r^(2^1), r^(2^2), .., r^(2^(l-1)) mod m where l
is the length of your clear text. Then to generate the cipher text,
use the least significant bits of the numbers in the series as a one
time pad. Then send the result and r^l mod m.
Knowing p and q the inverse square can be calculated cheaply enough.

It it is described in AiC:Po CRYPTO 84, pp.289-299.

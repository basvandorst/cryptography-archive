This has been mentioned several times in these threads as 
a suggestion for criminals (and others) to follow, but it
just occured to me when reading this that this may be another
reason for not publishing the algorithm which has not been
mentioned here. 

I am no expert in cryptology, so some of this may be inaccurate, 
but doesn't the process of incryption _randomize_ the data stream?
WHat occured to me is that if I was a LEA considering some sort
of blanket _back door_ thru Clipper, one of the things I might
consider is some sort of statistical analysis of the input to the
chip, and place a flag of some sort (encrypted for me, of course)
in the output stream saying ... _this data hass possibly encrypted
input_.  Normal Clipper conversations would not set this flag,
thus I would immediately eliminate most of the traffic from needing
further processing.

Thus I could concentrate my back door attack, or court order
processing, on communications apparently using encryption in addition
to Clipper.

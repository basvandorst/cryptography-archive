Cliff Sharp suggests that wiretap warrants be published widely a week after
they expire, except for clearly defined national security categories.

Although I have considerable sympathy with the idea, since it will
discourage frivolous or "fishing" wiretaps if the tappers knew their
activities would be revealed, it has the disadvantage of publishing the
names of those who were once "under suspicion."

Though "innocent until proven guilty" is a core principle, many will react
to such names in ways that will not benefit those named.

"Uh, well, they didn't get anything on him, but if the FBI suspected him
they must have had SOME good reason." etc. etc.

On balance, protection of innocent individuals suggests that this idea needs
more work.

  There is the method commonly called "triple-DES", in which the data
is DES-encrypted with key A, DES-DEcrypted with key B, and DES-encrypted
with key A again.  This appears to have the basic effect of doubling
the effective key length from 56 bits to 112 bits.

  Actually, limiting the key length so that certain people -could-
break it was evidently the whole point of the excersize.

You didn't say RSA and DES, you said "the current systems" in a context
where it clearly meant "all current systems other than Clipper".  Anyway,
none of the information posted here gives one any reason to believe 
that RSA with medium-size keys (say 600 bits) is insecure, even under the
most generous assumptions about the opponent's capabilities.

Groundless speculation on the powers of shadowy government agencies, is in
essence a variation on the same sort of armchair conspiracy theories. 
So your theory revolves around NSA rather than Bavarian Illuminati or 
the Zionists; what's the difference?  It would be a very gerrymandered line
indeed that would somehow separate your speculations from the paranoid
variety, while conjoining them with those more respectable postings
on technical issues.

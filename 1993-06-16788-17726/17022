Rather than boyucotting someone who fails some political litmus
test, why not guide them into a mutually enriching path?

For example in Prof. Denning's textbook she has several fine
papers on how various large databases are not now secure
from 'trackers' and other statistical exploitations that
could be used to mine databases for, perhaps, data on _you_.

Since this kind of information-theoretic research protects
rather than compromises individual data it seems that we just
need to nudge her into continuing some of this fine research
that she started on a while ago in this area.

It seems a bit short-sited to reject a person's science because
their morality doesn't measure up to our norm. I'm sure
Galileo Galilei would agree.

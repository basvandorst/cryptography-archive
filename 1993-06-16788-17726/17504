This raises the most serious concerns about Clipper, and absent some
extremely strong safeguards (requiring the foreign organzation to present
specific evidence) could be enough of a concern to cause me to reverse my
position on key escrowed crypto.

The French and Japanese intelligence services are not some rogue outfits,
but part of their governments. The French, at least, have shown their
willingness to commit commercial economic espionage against us as an
official government matter. They cannot be trusted, period. I would not
believe some vaguely supported request from the Surete Nationale, even
though they are a separate agency. If it comes to a matter of trusting their
governments or no Clipper, I'd have to say no Clipper.

(Assuming the above report is accurate, of course.)

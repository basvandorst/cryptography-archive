True.  This means that the machines which can access via UDP (or other
protocols) can and should be able to do so.   Those which have or wish to use
email can continue as they currently do.

imho, other mechanisms are needed.  Real-time key retrieval is something I
would like and many others have agreed would be handy.

I would not support any method which destroyed my personal ring.  That would
make the whole PGP key signing useless.

This is not a flame.  What do you mean by ex-directory?  I'm afraid I don't
see the concept...

     I to am very gung ho about PGP.  We do however differ strongly
     regarding concerns about terrorists, child pornographer, and bikers,
     etc.

     With terrorists a few messages, say 100, should be the maximum required.
     This would amount to a handful of one time pads or a book cipher.  If a
     larger number of messages were used traffic analyses would eat these
     people up.

     As to the child pornagraphers locking up their boards/transmissions
     this could be a very good thing.  Fewer unknowns accessing
     those boards would mean fewer children accessing those boards. 
     This could very well cut down on the number of children and
     other unintended recipatants receiving pictures, offers to sell,
     etc. from the pornographer. 

      As far as the Waco incident is concerned, I don't see how it
      would have effected things one way or the other.  Communications
      security was never an issue with the non-governmental side. 
      Communications was.  So was the ability/willingness to think on
      the part of 'our' law enforcement agencies. 

      I never have had a problem with making the job of the
      enforcement arms of the government more difficult.  A large
      portion of the constitution is devoted to just this task. 
      Search warrants, rights to an attorney, no self incrimination,
      etc. are all directed towards making a case more difficult to
      develop and to prevent the individual suffering at the hands of
      government. 

      PGP and other strong crypto systems are just another way to say
      "May I see your warrant, please" when the cop knocks at the
      door.

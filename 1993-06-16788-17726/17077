     Let the record show that Mr. Sternlight has addressed one tongue
in cheek remark while ignoring every substantive point raised in my
post.  His initial attack I was willing to attribute to careless reading
of my comments.  Given his subsequent statements and mischaracterizations
of my position I can only conclude that he is either intellectually
dishonest or a fool.  Which is it, Mr. Sternlight?

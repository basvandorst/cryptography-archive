  There have been a few problems with PGP 2.3, mostly involving recognition
of ASCII-armored signatures.  This severely impairs the ability of PGP 2.3
users to authenticate e-mailed text, but doesn't seem to compromise the
encryption system itself.  As far as I've been able to tell, the signature
posted on the Net for the .ZIPfile, and the signature for the expanded .EXE
file check out.
  DOS PGP users should probably stick to 2.2, or 2.1 if the incompatibility
between 2.2 and some types of compression rears its ugly head in their
systems.

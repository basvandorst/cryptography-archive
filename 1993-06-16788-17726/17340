You could run PEM in a PGP way just trusting certs in an arbitary manner. You
can setup your own hierarchy and DN's can have certs signed by several 
authorities. If you don't trust a PCA, then use another one. (:->

But, the strength is that you DO trust the PCA's certs. PGP users could organise
and mimic this structure. Would anybody trust a PEM<->PGP gateway?

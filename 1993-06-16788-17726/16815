I've been told that the files are available directly as

  ftp.tis.com:pub/PEM/dist/pem-212796/p-6.0.tar.Z

I just tried the pipeline

  ftpget ftp.tis.com:pub/PEM/README | grep pub/PEM

which produces the same information. Check your system for something
like ftpget (ftpcat, ncftp, whatever...).

If you want to compare TIS/PEM to RIPEM, use alt.security.ripem; if you
want to compare it to PGP, use alt.security.pgp. If both, use both.

Have fun! Oh, and please don't violate any export regulations.

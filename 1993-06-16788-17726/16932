Dr. Denning the point some of us are trying to make is that it is
wrong for the federal government to be the initiator of this PERIOD.
If they wish to publicly announce that there is a need for standards
in this area, and fund research via the usual channels (NSF, DARPA, or
whatever floats your boat) then all is well and good. Or if they were
to use some existing method as a starting point and ask that future
methods be checked out as "safe" by the Feds, that's fine. A standards
committee with say ANSI or CCITT with well-know and respected members would
be the place to start such things, not the secret labs.

The odor of rotting mackerel is quite heavy around the Clipper proposal.

It is very common these days to try and compare the federal government
to business methods. Last I checked businesses weren't extorting my money
to spend on dams in someone else's state. Companies keep works in progress
secret so their competitors won't get the jump on them, not so that their
customers will be caught by surprise.

Count on me to use my financial leverage AGAINST any company adopting
something like the Clipper proposal in their products, and to urge others
to do the same. At the very least I'll make up stickers to put on people's
phones:

Type I for unencrypted phones: 
	This phone is unsecure, assume John Q. Public is listening.

Type II for unencrypted phones:
	This phone has a Clipper chip, add references to pot smoking and
	other victimless crimes to your ordinary phone conversations freely.
	This will waste the time of some revenue officer somewhere on a
	fruitless investigation should they intercept your call.

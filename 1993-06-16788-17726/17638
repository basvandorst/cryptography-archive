What EEPROMs and CPUs are you using?  Some kind of almost free 8035?

The 1Mbit EEPROM used in the board I currently know about (which has
nothing to do with cryptography) costs a lot less than the CPU, and the
CPU is a "low cost" 16MHz RISC.  I would have guessed that compressing
speech, if not the cryptography, would require some horsepower.

   I envision the widespread use of souped-up Clipperphones that can
   operate both in secure mode (for general use) and compromised mode
   (for talking to the government, and those sheep deathly afraid of it).

For export, this is unlikely - NSA and/or NIST has said they'd handle approvals
on a case-by-case basis, which can be assumed to eliminate Clipperphones
with escrow field masking, which is trivial to implement on a
programmable phone.  (Adding other encryption isn't hard either, but
it takes enough ROM space for the additional programming that it's
likely to cost more than a straight-Clipper phone, at least if you're
using flash eproms instead of cheapo-roms.)

For US domestic use, it's not clear what restrictions "NIST" will place
on access to the chips - will they be available to everyone, in which
case escrow-masked Clipperphones will become rapidly available,
or will they only be available under special contracts that require
you to obey lots of rules about no masking and either no programmability
or at least no public availability of programming information?
It would be possible for them to do that without legislation,
especially if they have Mykotronx put it in the contract instead of "NIST".

Since this is a rant rather than a technical discussion, I've set

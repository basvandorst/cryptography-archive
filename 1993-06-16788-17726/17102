Yes, it appears to be so.

By the way, some people seem to be saying that PGP is not freely
distributable in USA because of the patent on RSA.  This seems to be
based on the assumption that distributing software which can be used
to implement a patented process is infringing a patent.  Is there any
legislation and court cases to back this up?  My impression is that
software (especially in source form as PGP is distributed) is more
like instructions on how to perform a process, and the manufacturing
is when someone compiles the software and loads it to a machine for
executing.

Yes.  I think even closer would be if the public domain RIPEM code
would be distributed outside USA as well (I understand such is not
done currently - at least not openly - because of the wish of the
author of RIPEM), and there would be a free RSA package developed
outside USA which would be plug-compatible with RSAREF.

I think we're in this together whether in USA or some other country,
and should look at the whole picture.  I think it is a good goal to
make ordinary people able to communicate securely with people in other
countries even if the governments and intelligence agencies don't like
it.  Some day it may be vital.

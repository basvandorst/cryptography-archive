I have a few questions which perhaps some of you with some knowledge 
about cryptography and national security law can answer.  Maybe not.
 
(1)  What happens to me if I send some encrypted message to 
     anyone@whitehouse.gov but forget to include the key?
 
(2)  What happens to them?  Do they waste $$$ trying to decipher it?
 
(3)  About these export controls.  Why don't we all write piddly 
     little encryption programs (who cares if they work?) and flood
     their offices with formal requests to export them, so that the
     bureaucratic algorithm for reviewing them becomes "computationally
     infeasible."

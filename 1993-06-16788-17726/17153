Whoops, I just found out how they REALLY did it.  The story that I had been
working from (a field unit was captured) was disinformation.

Actually, the Poles bought an earlier commercial version of the Enigmia.  The
French turned a crypto clerk who supplied details on the rotors.  The French
supplied this information to the Poles.  The Poles built copies of the German
Enigmia as actually used by the German Army and gave copies to the British
and French.

Or so an article in Cryptologica says ;)

Is it any more unlikely to be a code than the BBC signals to the
underground during WW-II?

Of course...  It makes perfect sense to broadcast language, grammar, or
typing lessons on a VHF frequency allocated for forestry use, limited by
line of sight, over a directional antenna.  That increases the audience
greatly. And, of course, it COULD be a studio-transmitter link if it was
on a frequency allocated for STL, which it's not.  And it COULD be
something totally innocent and the change in operating characteristics
after Cliff contacted the Feds COULD be totally coincidental.

OTOH, it IS an interesting problem.

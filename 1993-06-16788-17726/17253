This has already been addressed recently on this group.  The short
answer is that this suggestion is no good because audio-CD's have a
very low entropy... and therefore make quite poor OTP's.  In addition,
the keyspace of such pads is diminishingly small:  a few tens of
thousands of commercial CD's exist in all, which makes exhaustive
search of the keyspace quite feasible.  Same goes for data CD's.

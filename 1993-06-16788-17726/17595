   When I invoke the following:

			pgp -ka pubring.pgp clark.asc

   I have verified that the pubring contains at least my own pubkey by
   using the following command:  pgp -kv pubring.pgp.

   The result is a listing of my key.

   Am I doing something wrong, or is pgp hopelessly broken?

Yes, if you read the help text (from pgp -k), you will notice it says:

   pgp -ka keyfile [keyring]

You are giving the filenames in the wrong order, so its trying to add
pubring.pgp to Clark.asc!  And this, of course, won't work...  

Hope this helps...

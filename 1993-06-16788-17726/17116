I oppose the Clipper chip in the VERY interests of holding the breadth -
and width, and height - of the US Government. It is entirely TOO broad,
wide, and tall for it's britches at the moment; and it's eating it's citizens
out of house and home.

Ms. Denning, if you want to sell this product commercially to anyone who
wants it, that's your perogative. I will not allow you or anyone else to 
shove it down my throat as the only legal, government-approved option. 

A giant leap from where we are now might just burn the bejeezus out of our
tootsies, if you catch my drift.

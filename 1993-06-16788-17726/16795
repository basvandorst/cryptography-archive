Well, I frankly don't care whether or not /you/ will go out and join
the NRA because you're supporting the right to private use of crypto,
but certainly the NRA /should/ be lobbying for it.  This is one of
those rare issues where Liberals and Libertarians happen to be on the
same side, and to ignore that fact just because you don't like the
others is just plain stupid, and a good way to lose political
momentum.

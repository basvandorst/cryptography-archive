   I have what's probably a dumb question.  The FEAL encryption scheme uses
a fairly weak F function, (applied to one half of the cipher block, the result
XORed into the other half), using only 16 bits of key per round.  However, the
Fk function used in key-scheduling uses 32-bits of key per round to randomize
32 bits of input.  Any guesses as to why they didn't simply use the Fk function
instead of the F function?
 
   You can solve directly for 2 of the 6 bytes of input into the FEAL F
function, but I don't think you could solve directly for any of the 8 input
bytes to the FEAL Fk function.

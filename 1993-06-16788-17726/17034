   Might be a stupid question, but what else available at the time was more
secure (besides lead-covered codebooks on submarines, at least one of which
was captured)?  Also, do you believe that Enigma could have been solved
without a copy of the machine (thoughtfully provided by a Polish national)?

   Very true, in most cases.  But in my own case as an amateur, I've really
never believed that anything I've come up with was _really_ secure against
attack by professionals.  It's possible I _am_ incompetent, but at least
give me credit for trying to become competent by studying everything I can
get my hands on.  (And, does the fact that I submitted my own algorithm
on the net rather than keeping it to myself bring me anywhere above amateur
status?  :-)  I can't figure a way to break it, but I'm submitting it to
scrutiny to see if anyone else can.)

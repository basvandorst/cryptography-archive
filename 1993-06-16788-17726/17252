So who else do we stop?  People with a taste for brown shirts?  People with
oddly-trimmed mustaches?

Sorry, but this attitude that a public call for a boycott is "antidemocratic"
and "Hitler-like" bothers me.  Nobody's being forced to agree to the boycott,
and those who do make the decision ultimately of their own free will.  Churches
that organize mass burnings of Rolling Stones albums go out and buy the records
then torch 'em; other than the air polution, I have no problem with it.  As
soon as they come knock on my door and attempt to coerce me to hand over my
copy of Sticky Fingers (or whichever one I own in my dusty LP collection), the
ball game changes and I fight.

(Of course, Mr. Sternlight, I wholeheartedly support your denunciations *as
such*; I would never agree to stifling your opinions a priori.  Let people
decide for themselves, as I did.)

I'd like to redirect follow-ups, but I have no idea where to send them.

    Please re-read that posting.  The post was composed "on-the-fly" so
its not as clear as I would like.  Note that I had no objection to Ms.
Denning expressing her opinion concerning Clipper.  I stated that she even
had a responsibility to do so, as we all do.  My objection was to her not
carefully prefacing her remarks as to the advisability of its
implementation with the admission that such issues were beyond her
'professional' competence.  It seemed to me that her comments dwelt
primarily on the 'need to implement the proposal' rather than the
technical merits of the proposal itself.  If she chooses to use a public
opportunity to address the technical merits of the proposal as a 'soapbox'
to defend its implementation, then it does tend to appear that she does so
based on her academic standing as a cryptologist; this is what I find
"abhorrent".  We may have been better served if she had discussed the
technical difficulties of law enforcement agencies' engaged in warranted
wiretapping should strong cryptosystems become widely available.  
For instance, if two parties are using cellular telephones equipped with
good cryptographic hardware, the executing a wiretap warrant would be
almost impossible if they are driving about.  Some cellular services
extend offshore and this would become a concern of the NSA.  Perhaps
Clipper is the easiest way to deal with these concerns, but only if strong
cryptotechnology is outlawed for civilian use.  If Ms. Denning were to
address these issues and their implications from a technical feasability
standpoint, then we would be greatly indebted to her.  However,  it seems
that her remarks avoid addressing the main question altogether, just as
the FBI and NSA did.  The main question is this: "What problem does
Clipper solve?", personal privacy or the government's ability to thwart
privacy protections, warranted or otherwise?  I tend to think that the
U.S. government has grown cozy with a technology that permits them to
readily eavesdrop on its citizenry, something that it couldn't do in the
18th and 19th centuries.  The technology has turned around and "bitten"
them.  I'm afraid that they are fighting a losing battle against
technology and that Ms. Denning publicly defends their efforts while
failing to voice their rationale for fighting in the first place.  As a
cryptologist, it would be natural for her to esteem the value of
cryptanalysis, that dreaded technospeak for eavesdropping, yet I don't
seem to recall that word passing her lips/typewriter.  All I would like to
see is a bit more openness.

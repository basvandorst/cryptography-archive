I have a slightly different perspective myself.  I see that I have a choice
to make between:

  - buy a "Clipperphone" with probably pretty good crypto, but obvious 
  "backdoors" in the form of tempting escrowed keys.  This, to me,
   seems too tempting to abuse in the name of expediency.

  - buy a "DESphone" with probably not quite as good crypto, but no obvious
  backdoors just tempting abuse.

I worry that legislation will prevent the latter choice, or that vendors
who might be tempted to offer the latter will not be able or permitted to
market them.

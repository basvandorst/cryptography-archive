Because the guy who started this thread set follow-ups that way (doesn't
make sense to me either).

It's a bit annoying, but you get used to it (maybe smart newsreaders of the
future will suppress the display of the sig and give you an option to
check it).  It's not necessary for the majority of postings, but those
postings outside a.s.p and sci.crypt that do use it will generate interest.

I also doubt it, mainly because the keyring would be upward of 400 Meg
(that's based on the typical number of sigs found on keys today - as PGP
grows that number is likely to increase).

Yes, by the time we reach a million keys we'll probably need a different
strategy for key distribution.  Maybe not, though - I think you could
manage with a selective strategy:

  1) Pick and choose the keys posted to a.s.k.  E.g., people you know,
     people who make informed postings on subjects that interest you.  Maybe
     just go for keys that have the most sigs on the basis of building up
     the web of trust.

  2) Grab individual keys from mail-servers as required for a specific use.

Hmm, maybe a fast socket server *is* needed - it's a pain waiting for a mail
server to process a request so you can check the authenticity of a posting.
What I don't think should happen is the original poster's idea of
removing any local key storage and handling it all by server.

It will indeed, though I suspect the mechanisms will change each time the
users increase by a factor of 10.  At the moment you need every key available
to stand a chance of finding a web of trust; by the time we reach a million
keys a random sample of a couple of thousand together with a request to
a key-server for the recipient's key will probably do the trick.

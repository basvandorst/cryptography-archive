But, what does that have to do with our government outlawing crypto?

Saddam is smart enough to start up his own nuclear program.  You don't
think that mindset won't lead to doing his own crypto, too?  If I were
him, I wouldn't use any _American_ invented crypto.  I'd do my own.  So,
what has this to do with Clipper or what we're allowed to use?

Fortunately for our law enforcement types, it is surprisingly often true
that most of them are rather lazy and stupid.  And, if they're not, there's
other things to do besides crypto to keep out of the way of the police.
The average Mafioso probably relies on his own memory for a lot of stuff--
that's still decrypt-proof, you know.

So what?  Look, the terrible people you worry about have been in
business for decades or centuries now.  I don't see a lot of evidence that they
use crypto today and I don't see any evidence that any more or less of
them will be in prison if we somehow outlaw private crypto.

The idea that law enforcement will cease if crypto is widespread and
legal seems like scare tactics to me.  Don't fall for Law Enforcement
fantasies.  If you listen to that stuff long enough, you'll end up trading
in the whole Bill of Rights.

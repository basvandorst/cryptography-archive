Apart from the export provisions, are there any controls on crypto
technology?  Am I committing a felony if I invent a new cryptosystem
or I implement RSA with 10,000 digit keys (assuming that I pay
PKP the required royalty)?

If so, then our rights are in greater danger than I thought, and
we NEED cryptography which cannot be read by the government.

Otherwise, a national decision to stop all controls on crypto technology
is no leap at all--we are already there.  What would be a great leap
in the right direction is a commitment by the government to not
criminalize privacy in the future.

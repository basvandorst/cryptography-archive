Arjen Lenstra, actually.

   had been successfully factored.  The investment involved was estimated at 830
   MIPS years.  It just so happens that I got a e-mail the other day of a
   preliminary

   ...

   The relevant numbers are:  R-max  59,700 MFLOPS
			      R-peak 131,000 MFLOPS

   Using the VERY conservative estimate that 1 MFLOPS = 1 mips, along with
   the lower
   R-max value, we see that the NSA should be able to crack RSA-120 in 

   830 mips-years / 59,700 mips = 0.14 years, or just over five days.

Minor nitpick -- 0.014 years, or just over 5 days.  Of course, it is not
quite so simple as that, as you still need the odd gigabyte of disk to
store the relations, and having gobs of physical memory helps as well,
but I think we can assume it's available.

   RSA-120 is approx. a 400 bit number, so it is safe to assume that the NSA
   can break a casual grade PGP key (the 384 bit option) with ease.

But of course.  384-bit numbers are straightforward to factor without
having to go to extraordinary lengths.  That's not to say they are easy
for the likes of us -- I can just about reach 320 bits -- but they are
accessible.  If you were to pay me enough to factorize a 384-bit number
(half the cash in advance) I could probably do it.

Unless the factorizers are not telling me something I'd very much like
to know, 512 bits are beyond current technology available to the likes
of Lenstra and his co-workers.  (To head off the well-meaning folk who
wish to tell me that Lenstra et al. factorized 2^512+1 a little while
ago, I'll remind you that they used an algorithm which exploited the
simple form of that number; I'm describing the factorizations of
"difficult" 512-bit numbers).

   there is a big
   difference between 400-bit numbers and 1024 bit numbers.

That's quite an understatement!

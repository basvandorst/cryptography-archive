I think a moderated group is a good idea, and I hope that 
well-researched posts on political and legal issues do get
onto that group.  Just splitting into tech and talk won't
work, as a LOT of stuff will just be posted to both, and
then we get to see it twice.

And I bet the "Assumptions obout NSA Capabillities" thread would
be put on the technical group.

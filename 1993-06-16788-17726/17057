Actually, a Polish Army unit working with the British on a mission specifically
aimed at acquiring an Enigma :)  It was a well planned and executed operation.

One of the basic tenets of secure crypto is the assumption the enemy, Big
Brother, Competitors, French Intelligence, etc. knows everything about your
process.... they just don't have the keys.  History shows this is a very good
assumption to make.  Enigma is such an historical example.

BTW, Clipper fails this test of secure crypto ;)

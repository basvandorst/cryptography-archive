Well, since most people already have "Finger for PGP Public Key" in their
sigs, why not create a new finger type program?  Then just pgpkey login@host
to get a key.  Distributes the load and keys, right?

Keyservers then could offer key retrieval for hard to reach hosts (offline 
nodes &c) and a sort of "reverse name server" to take KeyIDs and turn them
back into name@IP.numbers, returning this to your pgpkey program so that it
can query the propper host.

Then you've got total control over a .keyfile in your directory.

I am currently engaged in a project to create a UN*X gateway for
our Courier mail (later bought by Microsoft) Post offices.  I have
a general description of the system, and have been able to reverse
engineer some of the system.  

I heard that this was the topic of recent discussion on this newsgroup.

I am interested in knowing if anyone has any hints on the encryption
system used.  It seems to be based on an 8 byte key, where 2 bytes 
are taken from the message to be encrypted, some work performed on the
two bytes with the key, and so on.  It looks fairly simple.

I know it has been worked out before. I'd appreciate a point in the
right direction. 

I'll keep hounding around until I break it or I find some help.

Thanks,
Eric.

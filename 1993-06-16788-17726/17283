It turns out that the Net-2 cksum was based on the POSIX sample code,
which did not comply with the POSIX spec. My fptocksum matched the Net-2
cksum. Any vendors who obtained cksum from Net-2 (e.g., BSDI) will have 
to fix it. Beware!

The BSD 4.4 cksum will, I believe, comply with the POSIX spec, and hence
will be compatible with the GNU cksum.

(Ain't POSIX a great thing? [sigh])

A week or so ago there appeared an announcement for Crypto 93.  I read it
and didn't save it, 'cause I didn't think I could go.

Things have (maybe) changed, and I might get to go.  Unfortunately I can't
find the announcement with registration info, costs, etc.

I would be grateful if some kind soul who saved this could e-mail it to me.
Thanks in advance.

While raw audio requires much more than 4800 baud for transmission, compressed
_speech_ requires much lower rates, some as low as 4800 baud.  At rates this low
the speech quality is not good but still understandable.  One of the techniques
used to get rates this low is to model the vocal tract and send only the control
parameters, not the result.

In general, transmision of audio intended for a human ear can use quite high
compression ratios based on recent advances in modeling human hearing.  For
general "music", compression to rates in the 64-128 Kbit/S per channel range 
are considered transparent.  For speech, where both the generating and receiving 
systems are well know, parametric ("vocal tract") encoders can do enormously better.

What makes you think that _physical_ access to the phone would be
required?  Why not just program the chip so that the key can be changed
remotely just by a phone call? All it would take would be some logic
such as:

if(remote machine serial number = XYZABC) receive and store new key

i.e. can we be sure the key used is the one so carefully (or otherwise),
blown into the "unreeadable" PROM ?

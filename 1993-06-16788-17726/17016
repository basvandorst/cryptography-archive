Whilst testing my PEM on a PC implementation, I got some encrypted mail
sent to me. Due to a bug, the MIC failed. I allowed the program to
continue and decrypt the message anyway which worked fine.

What I think the question is... Should the PEM implementation force me
to have valid certs for the originator by using their PUBLIC key to
encrypt the IV which is other wise sent in plain? Thus without a valid
cert for the originator I would not be able to decrypt the message
easily..

Or do I say, well this didnt pass the MIC and because you don't have a
certificate for xxx, so don't beleive it..

Pete.

  Yes, but doesn't that "property" often include documents, which are
meaningful solely because of their informational content, not because of
any forensic significance of their physical composition?
  Maybe you need to spend years in law school to see how there could exist
a legal doctrine that would prohibit the subpoena of encypted files when
a court has been presented evidence that a specific communication is relevant
to a crime, while permitting key escrow which has the effect of a subpoena
served upon all users without any presentation of evidence whatsoever.

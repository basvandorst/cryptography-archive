Wait a minute.  Having qualifications as a specialist in constitutional
law, or ethics, has never been a prerequisite to having or stating an
opinion.  We must take Dr. Denning's opinion for what it is: the
opinion of an expert of one of the subjects at issue.  We must then
collect opinions of legal experts, authorities on business practice,
and any others whose advice we think germane.  We may even find
experts within one field who have conflicting opinions.  Or we may
solicit views from people whom we consider sensible or prudent.  Then
we weigh all these views within our own ethical framework to derive
our own opinions.  But don't say that an expert [or a neophyte] in one
field is forbidden to have thoughts and opinions in another area.

hypothetical possible reason for NSA keeping Skipjack secret,

   Probably true if you mean that a)Clipper-type algorithms are, at present,
   infeasible to crack and b) the NSA would keep any algorithm it couldn't
   crack secret to prevent the bad guys from using it.

Even if the NSA can crack DES through intelligent use of brute force
(e.g. differential crypt + big iron, as opposed to some still-hidden back door)
which they tend to deny in public, it appears highly unlikely that
they can crack Triple-DES, which is relatively well understood,
and unknown-but-unlikely that they can crack IDEA either,
but they have no control over them, since the algorithms are publicly known.
So instead they're trying to get the good guys to use a
weak cryptosystem based on a strong algorithm, so they can still spy on us.

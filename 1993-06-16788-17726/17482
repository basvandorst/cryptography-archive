    If one has a hardware generator of random numbers, based upon a 
    physical process (thermal noise, radioactive decay, etc.), then is 
    this device subject to export control?

    Are even the relatively simple software methods used to encrypt/decrypt
    using random OTP subject to export control?

    I can envision relatively complex implementations of some of the tests
    for randomness done in Knuth that would be of mathematical interest and 
    totally free of export control, and extremely simple XOR OTP software
    that *would* be subject to control.

    Recognizing that few posters are legal experts (but that's never stopped
    us before), what says sci.crypt?

What's to stop crooks and political killers from using PGP now?  NOTHING.
So, if these boneheads outlaw PGP and give me the clipper chip to use,
(which I won't), what's to stop crooks and political killers from using
PGP then?  The LAW?   I submit that if these guys had any respect for the
law they wouldn't be crooks and political killers in the first place.
I mean, anyone who is going to try and put a bullet into the President
is not really going to care about using an illegal encryption scheme.  I
probably should have encoded this message, since the words "bullet" and
"President" no doubt just set off about a billion alarms and NSA guys are 
now perusing this message wondering if I am a loony.  It's okay, guys, go
back to eating doughnuts...  Same argument as always:  outlawing X means
that only outlaws will use/have/bear X, and people who are already doing
outlawed things won't care, and so they'll have X and I won't.  In the case
of guns, it is something I can understand, though not approve of.  If you
make it illegal for people to have guns, and let cops shoot anyone with a 
gun, our inner city violence will probably drop.  (That violence due to guns,
anyway.)  This is, of course, only applicable if we choose to ignore the 
Constitution, which Clinton seems to be doing a pretty good job of.  So, if
we outlaw cryptography, except that which the government can crack, only
criminals will be using uncrackable cryptography.  (I use the term uncrack-
able here to mean "not easily crackable by the government.')  That means when
I use PGP, I will break the law.  So, even if I design and write my own 
software to implement my own encryption algorithm, if the government has
no back door I have broken the law.  Is it just me or does the Constitution
seem to be worthless these days?  Let's recycle the bloody thing!  It doesn't
seem to have much value other than that anymore.

Go, Clinton.

I'm glad I didn't vote for him.  

Raph

I have an alpha version of a public key system using LUC available.
I'm making it available by anonymous ftp to U.S. and Canadian users
from netcom.netcom.com. I'm distributing this at this early time
in the hope that people will grab it and send me comments. It is
not a "finished product".

So, to get it:

anon ftp to netcom.netcom.com
cd /pub/henderso
binary
get l3-0.3.6.tar.z
quit

The file is compressed using gzip.

Please do not export this outside of the U.S. and Canada or
give this to people who are neither citizens of the U.S. or
Canada nor permanent residents of the U.S.A.

I did this primarily to prove to myself that LUC is indeed
a practical system for public key cryptography. Of course, in 
some sense it is a new system, so you may decide not to trust
the security of anything based on LUC.

Source code is provided for Unix (Linux, RS6000, SUN OS 4.1.1).

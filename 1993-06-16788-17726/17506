   Sure.  Exactly as it is handled with PGP.

Cannot to it.  PEM certificates only have one signature (as I pointed
out in my last article)...

   Let me elaborate: the only "problem" I have with PGP key distribution is the 
   lack of centralized CAs, because this makes certificate handling more 
   unwieldy.  It reminds me somewhat of the "hostname problem" before the advent 
   of the DNS.

Wait!  Are you talking about Key Certification or Key Distribution.
PLEASE do not confuse the two.  They are totally separate issues.

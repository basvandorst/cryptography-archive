You ask?  I answer:  Patrick May didn't write what you say he did.
Patrick May said, and I quote:

I'm hard put to find a more legitimate, responsible if not positively
genteel exercise of political speech in the finest First Amendment 
democratic tradition.  Mr. May specifically invites thoughtful
reflection on the part of readers, and expresses his *own* intentions
in the matter.

Somehow or other, this has caused your head to fill with superheated
steam, and you're blowing it off here.  

*Still waiting* for an explanation of the connection between the above
statement and the tyrannical exercise of power that ruins lives on the
scale of A. Hitler, or even Joe McCarthy.

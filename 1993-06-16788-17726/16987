OK Everyone: 

Take a deep breath.
Close your eyes.
Repeat after me:

"I will not respond to flame bait."
"I will not respond to flame bait."
"I will not respond to flame bait."
"I will not respond to flame bait."
"I will not respond to flame bait."
"I will not respond to flame bait."

as many times as needed until the urge to flame Sternlight goes away.

Andrew.

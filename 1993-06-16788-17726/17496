Mandelbrot proposed (and empirically verified) a Levy-stable
distribution of line-noise.  Amongst other things, this hypothesis
means that increasing signal strength will decrease the frequency of
noisy intervals, but there will always remain a positive proportion of
intervals of given length of arbitrary noise density.  The practical
meaning of this is that making lines clearer is never quite sufficient
for lossless transmission; and therefore forms of error-correction
must be incorporated.  Mandlebrot writes about it in his _Fractal
Geometry of Nature_, which is a simply *wonderful* book in many ways
(for those not too faint of heart about a little higher mathematics).
He also gives citations for the original articles on the subject in
his book -- but I don't feel like looking them up right now.

Yours, Lulu...

Amanda is absolutely correct.  Quote from the TIS/PEM Certificate
Administrator's Guide:

  Users or groups who wish to use TIS/PEM with certificates that are
  part of the Internet certificate hierarchy should contact the
  appropriate certificate authority.  Organizations wishing to issue
  certificates to their users should contact a Policy Certification
  Authority (PCA).  Both TIS and RSADSI operate PCAs.  For information
  on TIS's PCA, please send mail to <tispca-info@tis.com>.  For
  infomation on RSADSI's PCA, please send mail to <pca-info@rsa.com>.

Note that the operative terms here are "should" and "a PCA", not "must"
and "the PCA".

Maybe there is and maybe there isn't a "problem" with PGP key distribution,
but for many of the purposes for which I would like to use authenticateable
signatures any scheme without a certification hierarchy is useless.  Yes,
I hate the fact that RSA is patented, I don't like the licensing terms for
TIS/PEM much (and the manuals STINK!  they're typical commercial-grade
garbage: targeted at morons they do nothing but repeat the prompts and
menus and provide a printed copy of the license) and so forth, BUT...
TIS/PEM exists, is free-of-cost for most purposes for which I have an
immediate use, it's use is legal, and certification hierarchy exists, etc.
Hopefully soon it will also be exportable outside of the U.S.  And finally...
in a mere 10 years the patents will expire... ;-)

For now, I believe that PEM is the answer to The Net's communication
security and authentication needs, and while somewhat unpleasant, PKP's
"free" licensing terms are workable (at least once export restrictions
are lifted).  If you don't like it, fight the patent office and work
for a future where such attrocities as patenting basic ideas and 
algorithms can't be committed.  Support the LPF.

	You *CAN'T* trust a OTP someone else gives you, unless you're
Mr. Sternlight and the NSA gave you the OTP.

	Seriously, though, the commercial OTP exists today. It's called
the floppy disk. If you get the NCSC's listing of computer security
products, there are boards you can get for the PC that produce random
numbers in bulk. I don't know if they come packaged with software, but
that's as close to a commercial OTP as you can get without having to
trust someone with your family jewels.

	As I've mentioned earlier, the biggest problem I see with the
OTP is that the key is [I don't know the technical term] NON-memorizable.
Suppose I have a 1Mb data file encrypted with a OTP. There's no way I
can possibly memorize the 1Mb key/pad for my data - I have to keep it
someplace. That means that if I lose it, I am hosed because my data *is*
unrecoverable. That means that if I'm cavity searched and they find that
8mm tape where I hid it (ouch!) then the data is compromised. Memorizable
keys (IDEA keys, DES keys, etc) have the advantage that you don't *HAVE*
to keep the key written down. I suppose if it merits it, you can dispose
of the key quickly with a .357 magnum.

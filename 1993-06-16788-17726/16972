  I've been skimming this thread.  I would be curious as to whether
Ms Denning's book includes contributions of her own to this field,
or whether research papers by her have appeared in the open literature.
(I think this was the intent of the original poster).

   It is, of course, possible that Ms Denning has made substantial
unpublished contributions, as I believe is the case with the designers
of DES.

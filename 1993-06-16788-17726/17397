Obviously.  You don't use RSA to transmit the data itself, you use it to 
transmit a key.  RSA is slow, but very secure *key control* --
 
You then implement some other algorithm to transmit the data, having 
used RSA to securely exchange unique keys for just that session.
 
Even a "weak" 2nd algorithm like DES can become quite strong if you limit 
the lifetime of each key to only a few minutes, thus denying the opponant 
enough material to crack the DES key.

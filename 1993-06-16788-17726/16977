Thank you for clearing this up. I must admit that at first I thought
this might be a frustrated reaction on your part to the baiting I and
some others have done lately by pointing out how each of the
government's initiatives to restrict privacy (starting with S.266 and
proceeding through Digital Telephony and now Clipper) have so far
backfired. The main effect of each has been to motivate the
"cypherpunks" to create and deploy freely available strong
cryptography much more quickly than it otherwise might have appeared.
Phil Zimmermann has specifically credited S.266 with inspiring him to
create PGP, and I'm sure you heard John Gilmore thanking Mr. McDonald
of the FBI at the CPSR meeting the other day for his part in
encouraging these efforts.

"A giant leap from where we are now"? Please explain. At present,
patent issues aside, there are no significant US government controls
whatsoever on the import or domestic use of strong cryptography
generated by the civilian sector.  There are only export controls,
which are largely meaningless given the widespread use and
international availability of public domain packages like PGP and DES.
As the FBI is so fond of saying, all we want to do is to maintain the
"status quo".  :-)

   Hmmm.  Sometimes, in crypto literature, the term "pseudorandom number
generator" is taken to mean an algorithm that expands a seed to a long
sequence of bits that is indistinguishable from a truly random sequence
of bits by any polynomial algorithm.  I believe the general idea is that
you have to find a one-way function that doesn't work badly when applied
to its own output an arbitrary number of times.
 
   Presumably, if you had a method of generating a stream of bits long
enough to use as an XOR pad for your message from a seed small enough to
use as a key, you'd have a workable stream cipher.  If there is no way
to differentiate in polynomial time (polynomial in the size of the seed,
I assume) between the pseudorandom pad generated and a truly random pad,
then that would mean that your message was secure against polynomially
bound attackers.  (Suppose a chosen-plaintext attack exists which will
allow some leakage of information about the seed.  Then, this could be
used in an algorithm to determine that the sequence came from the seed,
thus was not random.  Right?)

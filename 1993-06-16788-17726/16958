The people who invented RSA were professional MATHEMATICIANS, but not
professionals in cryptography.  I have not read their paper, but from
what I have read I presume that their work on the problem of factorization
led the to the conclusion that their public-key system is quite possibly
as difficult as factorization; I do not believe that this has been proved.
The related "Rabin" system is known to be as difficult.

A one-time pad with pure uniform random numbers is absolutely uncrackable,
and proving this does not require any knowledge of cryptography, but 
merely knowledge of probability.  The entire proof is that the probability
of any received message given the original message is the same independent
of the original message, so that there is no information available, except
possibly the length of the message.

  The usual implementations of public-key cryptography (RIPEM, PGP, etc)
encrypt each file via a randomly-generated session key, and then encrypt
the session key via the user's secret key.  The session key is used for
only one message; the secret key is used for many messages.

  Let us assume for now that the government's attempts to foist key
escrow schemes upon the citizenry find their deserved resting place
in the dustbin of history.  The government will then need to fulfil
the legitimate needs of law enforcement honestly (i.e. by establishing
its case that the contents of certain encrypted messages constitute
needed evidence, and obtaining subpoenas [subpoenae?] requiring that
the decrypted messages be produced).
  My question is: Is there a way to verifiably provide the decrypted
messages without compromising the secret key, which has probably been
used for many other messages which need not be disclosed?  The most
likely possibility at first glance is some way of allowing the government
access to the session keys of the specific subpoenaed messages -- can
this be done with verification for both sides, and would that information
seriously weaken the overall public key in any case?

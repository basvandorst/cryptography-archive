He is intelligent and sophisticated. Thus, one would not expect a crude,
ham-handed approach. Leaving aside that the above quote is out of context,
it is philosophically what I said. He distorts her position
propagandistically and inaccurately into having "no respect for human
rights" and having slid that false premise in, says, in effect, 'you
should consider whether you want to buy from such a person.'

It's a very nice example of sophisticated, but I think highly pernicious
propaganda, and among those who speak softly, is a call for a boycott.

One, I think, must show such things for what they are. Otherwise, the velvet
glove soon becomes the iron fist.

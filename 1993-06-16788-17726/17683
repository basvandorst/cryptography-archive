They are developing the machines themselves.  So sometimes they might
say, "Well, I'm not sure which memory board works best, so we'll try
the six best ones in different machines simultaneously."

Or maybe they're sitting there saying to themselves, "Well, the pastel
pink one is simply faaabulous next to that Navajo planter... but the
cream-white one just HAS to GO!"

Seriously -- they MANUFACTURE the things, so of course they're going
to have lots of them hanging around for testbeds and software
development.  At the very least, the people developing the OS kernel
pretty much have to have a few separate machines; you can't share time
when you're rebooting once every couple of hours to check your kernel
mods.

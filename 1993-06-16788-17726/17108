Actually, Denning's book is a rather good technical review of cryptology. 
This basic point has been somehow obscured in clouds of political
invective. While I don't necessarily agree with what is alleged about Dr.
D's alleged right-wing positions, I haven't actually seen them from her. 
(Unless last week's post was a forgery, she certainly is aware of this
debate.)  

I do have the book, and only regret that it takes a rather good
understanding of mathematics to understand all of it.  It doesn't seem
political at all, which is as it should be. 

Strongly recommended regardless of politics.  And as I recall, not too
expensive.

The following is my reponse to Science News, mailed today.

Dear Editor:

I found your article on the encryption policy controversy (SN: 6/19/93,
p.394) to be mostly accurate and fair, but I must take exception to the
closing thought. Lance Hoffman is quoted, repeating a popular
misconception: "For the first time in history, we have a situation in which
individuals can use cryptography good enough that even governments can't
read [the encrypted messages]."

This statement is false. Worse, it is misleading: suggesting that
governments might be justified in taking "first time in history" steps to
control individual use of cryptography.

Rather than evaluate a cryptosystem's strength based on what governments
can break (especially since that information is kept secret), we should
compare strength of systems used by individuals to those used by the
military.

David Kahn's book, "The Codebreakers" [Macmillan, 1967], gives the history
of cryptography for the last 4000 years. In all of this history, it is the
rule rather than the exception that cryptographic systems were invented and
used first in the private sector and that individuals have had and used
strong cryptography -- that is, cryptography as strong as that used by the
military and diplomats of the time. Cryptography is clearly a dual source
and dual use technology and always has been.

This misconception is understandable. Cryptography seems to develop
spontaneously whenever privacy is threatened. As Welchman points out in his
"Hut Six Story", the emergence of radio permitted the German Blitzkrieg and
at the same time demanded high volume use of encryption by the military. In
our lifetimes, then, we have come to associate stories of encryption with
the military (by volume of use) and with spies (by excitement of the
story). It is natural to overlook private individuals' invention and use of
cryptography. The same recent history leads people to think of cryptography
as somehow being the property of the NSA and similar agencies of other
governments, even though the NSA is a very recent creation. Now that the
private sector is using radio heavily (wireless and cellular phones,
cellular modems, etc.), our need for encryption is picking back up and we
should soon again have volume parity with the military.

This misconception may be understandable, but it is vitally important to
correct it, or else we may find ourselves having given away the right we
have always had to use our own strong cryptography for our own privacy even
from the government just when we start to need it most.

Sincerely,

Carl M. Ellison

P.S. DETAILS FROM KAHN

[Page references from David Kahn's "The Codebreakers".]

(p.77) Old Testament scribes used a cryptosystem called "atbash" - a
stronger system than the one Julius Caesar used for military communications
perhaps 1000 years later. "Atbash" used a reversed alphabet while Caesar
used a direct alphabet for substitution.

(p.126 ff) Alberti (b.1404), Trithemius, Belaso and Porta (b. 1535)
invented and published cryptosystems superior to those in use by the
military of the time (nomenclators). The military did not switch over,
furthermore. Methods for cracking these new polyalphabetic systems were not
generally known until 1863, but methods for cracking the nomenclators were
known in the 1500's.

(p.394 ff) Vernam invented the first provably secure system and made it
public on or before 10/21/1920. The military uses it today, but so can the
public. In the same time frame (1910-1940), a number of private inventors
created and sold electromechanical cryptosystems both to governments and to
individuals.  These include machines by Hebern and Hagelin but also the
famous Enigma system (modified for use by the German military).

===========================================================================

There are many more examples, but I didn't want to overwhelm the poor
editor.  It's time we in sci.crypt, however, start to gather this history
and cite it, IMHO.

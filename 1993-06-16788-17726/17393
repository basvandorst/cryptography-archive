	DNS is not a good choice, but might not something much like
the DNS work? In fact, the DNS code might serve as a good working
platform to start with. Unless I'm missing something, something like
named, but with the ability to accept key info that has been signed
by someone it trusts, would do the trick. Then, add signatures to
zone transfers, create a few zones for the uucp and bitnet folks,
and refine as necessary.

I've created an implementation of Michael Rabin's cryptosystem for the
graduate operating systems class I'm taking this quarter.  Its meant to
act as a replacement for the RSA toolkit (found at rsa.com).  However, I've
been unable to find a method for implementing authentication with Rabin (since
the encryption and decryption functions are too different from each other),
which makes the emulation of the RSA toolkit imcomplete.  Can anyone point me
towards any sources on implementing authentication with Rabin?  Thanks.

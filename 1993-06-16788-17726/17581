"Kahn on Codes" is pretty good.  Same publisher (Macmillan?) but don't know
the year.  Has anyone seen the kid's series "Ghostwriter" on PBS?  I saw it
for the first time last night.  The kid's were breaking concealment, trans- 
position, and substitution ciphers as part of catching some criminals.
Ghostwriter is this invisible being who does "funny things" with words and
helps them do the cryptanalysis.  Could it be Friedman from beyond the grave!?

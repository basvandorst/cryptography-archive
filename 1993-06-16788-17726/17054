I don't read his post that way.  All I see him saying is that there is a 
difference between bookburning and exercising a right not to buy a good that
is perceived as against one's interest to buy.  His definitions seem sound.
The difference is profound, because bookburners use active social pressure
to _take books out of the hands of those who, in their private hearts, would
wish to keep them_.  Patrick May is acquitted of that, surely.  The only question
is whether it is somehow moral or unethical to organize, rather than make the
decision one on one.  He hasn't even asked for an organization.  He merely
pointed out one measly fact that some may find salient.  There is a difference
between a "boycott" and a "bookburning".  By your lights, are we all inhibited
from speaking our mind, lest it cause economic injury to someone, somewhere?

Is it a boycott to say "I think product X is unsafe" on Internet or reveal any
reason whatever not to buy something?  Even if it is by your lights, what's
wrong with that kind of boycott?  If you can't see the difference between
that and bookburning, your lack of historical understanding of the latter is
showing.

No one is obligated to buy something they don't like.  He merely pointed out
an added factor to consider as to whether one would "like" a particular book.
The political views of an author on the subject of cryptography, whether an
eminent person, or a duffer, are fair game in a subject as politicized as
crypto.  Do you buy the autobiographies of the candidates you oppose in an
election year (knowing, by the way, that the money will support the campaign)?

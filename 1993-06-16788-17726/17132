The original release _suggested_ that outlawing other forms of encryption
might be considered in the future.  So far I don't believe that there has
been any attempt to resubmit the FBI-sponsored legislation from last
session -- which I believe may have permitted this.  That bill was
defeated.

Thus strnlght is right (at this moment) on this one topic, that one could
"pick something else."

Or maybe more to the point: don't buy her book because she *acts* on her
opinions in such a way as to actively promote the restriction of our
personal freedom and privacy.  *Nobody* boycotts anybody else for their
opinions alone... or wages war against them, say.  The West didn't bomb
Iraq because Saddamn Hussain *opined* that Kuwait is properly a part
of Iraq, we bombed him because he acted on that opinion in such a way
as to conflict with our (perceived) interests.  (No endorsement of the
Gulf war on my part is implied.)

Dr. Denning is not only holding opinions, she is actively promoting
policy which is in direct conflict with what I perceive to be my
interests, and extremely important interests at that.  Anyone who
suggests that it is unethical to take, and encourage others to take,
action (i.e. economic boycott, denouncement, etc.)  against some
person or group which in turn is acting on their opinions in such a
way as to be in conflict with my interests, is either completely out
to lunch or a Saint.  Are you a Saint, Mr. Sternlight?

Indeed.

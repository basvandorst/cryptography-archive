about the need for RFCs to define key distribution for PGP.

Dear Mr. Leyland,

I encourage you to hasten to read RFC 1422, which
is the third generation RFC in a continuing effort to
establish a public key
distribution hierarchy for the Internet.  This probablly
will lead you to
also read RFC 1424, and they 1421 and 1423.

Members of the Privacy-Enhanced Mail Working Group of the
Internet Engineering
Task Force will be in Cambridge, UK, the week of July 5,
and of course will be
at the IETF meeting in Amsterdam the week of July 12.  (In
fact, a member of WG
in on the staff of Cambridge University and has been
active in setting up
a key distribution system in the UK for Internet mail.) 
Perhaps we could
meet informally sometime in one of those weeks.

Attached are details on the RFCs, as well as the Executive
Summary for 1422.

Regards, -Rob-

1.  Executive Summary

   This is one of a series of documents defining privacy
enhancement
   mechanisms for electronic mail transferred using
Internet mail
   protocols.  RFC 1421 [6] prescribes protocol extensions
and
   processing procedures for RFC-822 mail messages, given
that suitable
   cryptographic keys are held by originators and
recipients as a
   necessary precondition.  RFC 1423 [7] specifies
algorithms, modes and
   associated identifiers for use in processing
privacy-enhanced
   messages, as called for in RFC 1421 and this document. 
This document
   defines a supporting key management architecture and
infrastructure,
   based on public-key certificate techniques, to provide
keying
   information to message originators and recipients.  RFC
1424 [8]
   provides additional specifications for services in
conjunction with
   the key management infrastructure described herein.

   The key management architecture described in this
document is
   compatible with the authentication framework described
in CCITT 1988
   X.509 [2].  This document goes beyond X.509 by
establishing

RFC 1422           Certificate-Based Key Management       
February 1993


   procedures and conventions for a key management
infrastructure for
   use with Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) and with other
protocols, from
   both the TCP/IP and OSI suites, in the future.  There
are several
   motivations for establishing these procedures and
conventions (as
   opposed to relying only on the very general framework
outlined in
   X.509):

       -It is important that a certificate management
infrastructure
           for use in the Internet community accommodate a
range of
           clearly-articulated certification policies for
both users
           and   organizations in a well-architected
fashion.
           Mechanisms must be provided to enable each user
to be
           aware of the policies governing any certificate
which the
           user may encounter.  This requires the
introduction
           and standardization of procedures and
conventions that are
           outside the scope of X.509.

       -The procedures for authenticating originators and
recipient in
           the course of message submission and delivery
should be
           simple, automated and uniform despite the
existence of
           differing certificate management policies.  For
example,
           users should not have to engage in careful
examination of a
           complex set of certification relationships in
order to
           evaluate the credibility of a claimed identity.

       -The authentication framework defined by X.509 is
designed to
           operate in the X.500 directory server
environment.  However
           X.500 directory servers are not expected to be
ubiquitous
           in the Internet in the near future, so some
conventions
           are adopted to facilitate operation of the key
management
           infrastructure in the near term.

       -Public key cryptosystems are central to the
authentication
           technology of X.509 and those which enjoy the
most
           widespread use are patented in the U.S. 
Although this
           certification management scheme is compatible
with
           the use of different digital signature
algorithms, it is
           anticipated that the RSA cryptosystem will be
used as
           the primary signature algorithm in establishing
the
           Internet certification hierarchy.  Special
license
           arrangements have been made to facilitate the
           use of this algorithm in the U.S. portion of
Internet
           environment.

   The infrastructure specified in this document
establishes a single
   root for all certification within the Internet, the
Internet Policy
   Registration Authority (IPRA).
**CHANGED TO Internet Certificate Issuers Registry (ICRA)**
                                   The IPRA establishes
global policies,
   described in this document, which apply to all
certification effected


Kent                                                      
     [Page 2]

RFC 1422           Certificate-Based Key Management       
February 1993


   under this hierarchy.  Beneath IPRA root are Policy
Certification
   Authorities (PCAs), each of which establishes and
publishes (in the
   form of an informational RFC) its policies for
registration of users
   or organizations.  Each PCA is certified by the IPRA.
(It is
   desirable that there be a relatively small number of
PCAs, each with
   a substantively different policy, to facilitate user
familiarity with
   the set of PCA policies.  However there is no explicit
requirement
   that the set of PCAs be limited in this fashion.) 
Below PCAs,
   Certification Authorities (CAs) will be established to
certify users
   and subordinate organizational entities (e.g.,
departments, offices,
   subsidiaries, etc.).  Initially, we expect the majority
of users will
   be registered via organizational affiliation,
consistent with current
   practices for how most user mailboxes are provided.  In
this sense
   the registration is analogous to the issuance of a
university or
   company ID card.

   Some CAs are expected to provide certification for
residential users
   in support of users who wish to register independent of
any
   organizational affiliation.  Over time, we anticipate
that civil
   government entities which  already provide analogous
identification
   services in other contexts, e.g.,  driver's licenses,
may provide
   this service.  For users who wish anonymity while
taking advantage of
   PEM privacy facilities, one or more PCAs will be
established with
   policies that allow for registration of users, under
subordinate CAs,
   who do not wish to disclose their identities.

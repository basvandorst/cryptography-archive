True, but...

Why was the public kept in the dark about the development of a "key
escrow" system?  It would appear to me that this was done so that the
"standard" could be offered as a fait acomplit, rather than offering
it up for public discussion and review BEFORE the investment was made.

  "Gee - we want to discuss this publicly and will do so.  In the mean
  time, the chips we developed in secret are going to be hitting the
  marketplace and (we hope) gaining market acceptance.  In fact, we 
  are going to begin shipping chips to AT&T while the public review
  is going on".

Maybe NASA should work this way.  They would have a much easier time
building that space station if they could spend the money in secret, 
then open the issue for public review & discussion once all the 
components are built and ready for launch.

this "escrowed key" nonsense established, as a standard.

Was the concept of "Key escrow" classified.  This could be discussed
without disclosure of technological details.  When your paper on this
topic first came out, I was amused and thought that this was an interesting
concept, but one that was not applicable in the US because I live in
a free country - or at least thought I did.

Are you saying that it was not possible to present a proposal of the
concept of the key escrow, administration thereof, etc. until after
years had been spent developing the algorithm & chip?  Where I come
from, the specification preceeds the project.

>With respect to the length of the review, I was responding mostly to

I would also advocate aborting any program for governmental review
of newspapers prior to publication, no matter how much $$ was invested 
in it.

This statement seems to be predicated on the gov't precieved need to 
monitor communications, an assumption many of us do not accept.

I submit that we could have public disclosure of the algorithm, and
an implemenation without a LEF field, of the same alorithm within 6 
months.

Then what is meant by the White House announcement something line "we
do not intend to interefere with the development of other systems with similar 
secure key escrow procedures".  (close but not exact on the quote).  The 
implication is pretty obvious to me...

It's not "market oriented" if a major player is rigging the game by
funding a project using tax dollars.

How about a "non escrowed" equivalent (same algorithm) and let the
market decide.

It has NOT been established that law enforcement NEEDS to be able to 
monitor communications any more than it NEEDS to be able to bug your house
without you detecting it.  Maybe phones need a "open microphone for room
bug remotely" as a mandatory feature for "law enforcement purposes".

The gov't should be free to develop its own crypto systems for classified
use without restriction.  The civilian sector should enjoy the same
rights.

Dorothy - please answer the following to we all know what you mean :

   Do you believe that citizens have the right to communicate with
   each other in a manner that the government cannot monitor or decrypt?

   This is a yes/no question.

   I still say that the problem with Clipper is *much* less that Clipper may
be a weak algorithm than that the cost to break the system will be too low.
By that, I mean that, assuming that all the precautions taken to keep anyone
from getting access to the escrowed keys are successful, and that the
algorithm is secure, it will still cost relatively little to break the system.
Some estimates put the cost of a DES keysearch machine around 20 million
dollars, to read an encrypted file in a few weeks.  Does *anyone* think that
20 million dollars can't buy a few Federal judges?  Does *anyone* think that
major organized criminal figures and foreign intelligence agencies don't
*already* have Federal judges on the payroll?
 
   Like the analog scramblers on the market now, the Clipper chip will raise
the cost of eavesdropping on you.  Unfortunately, it won't raise that cost
nearly enough for many sensitive conversations.
 
   Anyone want to discuss how to avoid "rubber-stamp cryptanalysis?"  I can
see ways to make it less attractive, but anything done in that direction will
also make wiretapping unattractively difficult, which is exactly the opposite
of what Clipper is intended to do.

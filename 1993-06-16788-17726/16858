Along the lines of joining the NRA because crypto is munitions, I've
actually done that.  Somewhat indirectly though: someone had
anonomously posted an offer where the NRA would sponsor memberships for
people who could write up an essay explaining why they should get it.
I wrote essentially that without access to weapons people can not
overthrow an oppressive government.  Last week I got the membership
anouncement, sometime in the next month I should get my card and
"American Rifleman" zine.

To maintain our freedom we need strong crypto.  If the government wants
to nail my ass for illegal activity, they can go thru due process and
get a legal wiretap/phone bug/surveillance system to watch me based on
probable cause.  Today I have lots of problems convincing people to
join the IMI (Illinois Marijuana Initiative) because they think a) it's
a government front, b) they will be watched by the cops more closely,
c...) other paranoia I haven't heard yet.  To help eleviate these
fears, the IMI mailing list is encrypted using a 64 bit DES.  This is
*nonstandard* and would take several million dollars to crack.  This
fact alone is beginning to get a few more people to sign up to help
legalization.

I also happen to be a member of the ACLU.  I certainly don't agree with
everything that the ACLU pushes, but I can tolerate their opinons
because they tolerate mine.  The NRA tends to be a little closed minded
on some aspects of gun control, but in the main, I agree with their
stands.  The fight against the Skipjack/Clipper forced encryption
standard is one that both of these groups should join forces on, because
freedom *is* the issue.

When I hear people tell me they are afraid to join a group that is trying
to get government to end it's amazingly stupid lies about a plant, it's
pretty obvious that there is a much bigger problem here.  When people
*know* their communications are secure from government intrusion, freedom
is enhanced simply because people can speak their minds without fear.
Today, they know they can't do that.  The American people are smart enough
to know they should fear their government, but they haven't figured out
(yet) what to do about it.

I'll bet the NRA doesn't even know that cryptography is a weapon.  I promise
I'll let them know once I get my membership card!

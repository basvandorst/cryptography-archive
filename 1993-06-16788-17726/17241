Below is the announcement of an RSA chip from 1986.  IC technology has
progressed since then.  A later chip from France (for which I've
misplaced the reference) could do 1024-bit en/decryption for arbitrary
exponents at 1kbit/second.

I said "arbitrary exponents" since 3 is sometimes used as the encryption
exponent, and is about 100 times faster than a general (~1024-bit)
exponent.

1kbit/sec is not fast enough for voice, but it could be used for key
exchange.

A Fast Asynchronous RSA Encryption Chip

G. Orton, L.E. Peppard, S.E. Tavares, Queen's Univ., Kingston, Ontario,
Canada

This RSA key encryption chip uses asynchronous modulo multiplication
to improve the throughput by a factor of 40 relative to a synchronous
implementation.  The chip is capable of an average throughput of
40 Kbit/sec for 512 bit encryption with a 2-micron CMOS process and a
1 square cm die area.

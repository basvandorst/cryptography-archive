Substitute "FBI" for "NSA".  Replay the arguments.

The FBI was run by J. Edgar Hoover for 40 years.  He was a homosexual,
which was apparently widely known in the Gay community and which made
him a subject for blackmail.  At the same time, he was
in charge of domestic counter-espionage.  Interesting to see what
is in the KGB files on their use of such information.

The FBI did nothing on organized crime.  Mr. Hoover apparently
gambled heavily, always collected winnings, never paid debts.

Mr. Hoover took expensive gifts from private individuals.

Mr. Hoover maintained his position by keeping files on public officials.
(It is an interesting sociological problem what percentage of the leaders
in gov, edu, and media you need to control in order to prevent such
information from leaking.)

Trust the the government?  Don't be ridiculous.  It is a certain way
to lose a democracy.

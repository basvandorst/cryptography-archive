Who's distorting who here?  He isn't distorting her position.  He's
stating his opinion, an opinion based on some fact.  Her support for
both clipper and the FBI wiretap law show a certain lack of respect
for privacy, something some of us consider an "individual right".
All he is doing is advocating personal responsibility.

Even apart from the transition of "individual" to "human", you distort
his position.  He never called for a boycott and it is not reasonable
to compare his statement to organized, government supported oppression
as you have done.

This incessant and unjustified personal attack by you on Patrick May is
rather strange, considering the number of times i've seen you voice your
opposition to personal attacks in these discussions.  Maybe you only
disagree with it when it's people who agree with you who are being
attacked?

You should look in a mirror sometime.  Based on what i've seen
here of your posts it seems clear that you know much more about
sophisticated and highly pernicious propaganda than most.

Velvet glove -> iron fist :: clipper, FBI wiretap -> ???

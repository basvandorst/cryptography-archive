Sounds reasonable to me, though I'm not sure I know what you mean by 
"conventional" military encryption. The phraseology implies a background 
knowledge of current military cipher systems in general that enables a 
distinction to be made between conventional and unconventional(?) systems.

I do also wonder why your information implies that military type encryption in
civil hands should be limited to "routine traffic". As one supposes at least 
some military ciphers are sufficiently strong, fast and flexible to 
secure the launching of Armageddon, one might allow that the same cipher 
systems are capable enough to secure rather more than an Ambassador's 
re-order of Jack Daniels/Laphroaig/whatever-the-national-poison-is?

True. But as many of us know, the literal OTP continues in use to this day.
As has been posted elsewhere, since the bare *concept* of an automated OTP 
is a simple one - and the system 'unbreakable' - wouldn't it be fun if 
someone produced one for common use?

Yes; of course. But since automated systems are not known to be widespread, 
perhaps the particular disadvantages outweigh the advantages for most purposes?
Come to think about it, perhaps physical security is not always the greatest 
vulnerability in a fielded OTP system?

Let's agree on a metaphorical local store, through which any book with an 
ISBN number can be ordered. In my case, at least, I'm still reading them :-)
(albeit not as avidly as once I did). They can be fine for theory - none 
better than some - but most of them are a little thin on the detail of 
practice, don't you agree?

That's interesting. Why would you not post about discrete mathematics and 
information theory in which you are trained, have first hand experience and 
may well be contributing original work, when you do post second hand 
derivations from the words of those who, if they truly shared their heart's 
knowledge with you, neither they nor you would post even as readily as you 
might with the first category?  

I have no wish to carp. I posted in response to two categoric statements 
made. The first was that the bulk of the major nations's diplomatic traffic is 
processed by OTP. The second was that the product is transmitted by 
diplomatic pouch. Your reply disposes of the first; perhaps we should take 
the second to e-mail?

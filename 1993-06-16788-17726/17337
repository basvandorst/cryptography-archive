	The 1989 NSA budget was actually nearer $14 billion.

	I think that you might be confusing the executive order
	with the charter of the NSA.  It was made public by being read
	into the Congreesional Record using Congressional Privilege (I
	forget by whom.).  If I remember correctly (no guarantees), the
	charter is available from a company called FOIA Press.  I'll
	check over the weekend.

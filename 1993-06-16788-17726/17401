As I've explained in many other messages, I assume that the NSA assumes
powerful and rich foreign adversaries may be able to break commonly used
commercial systems, such as vanilla DES. I further assume that perhaps 
RSA and other systems may be weak, particularly with shorter keys (there was
an extensive discussion of this on one of the other crypto-related
newsgroups).

If other systems are weak, NSA need not make them illegal.

I further assume that things are exacly what they are claimed--that Clipper
is a strong system designed to protect U.S. commercial traffic. Thus I
assume the only way to read Clipper is with the escrowed keys.

This explaines not only the above,  but also why the Clipper algorithm must
be kept secret--not because it's weak, but the opposite--if a "bad guy" got
hold of the algorithm, he could produce a non-key escrowed version for his
malfeasance, and it would be considerably stronger against legitimate law
enforcement efforts (say with a court order) than current commercial crypto.

This is, of course, a subject of some disagreement here--some are quite sure
that longer-key RSA and triple DES are, for all practical purposes secure
even against the NSA. But my view is better safe than sorry, so I don't
assume that.

I said, "given my assumptions." Recall that I assume that publicly available
non-Clipper crypto isn't secure and Clipper (excluding the escrow feature)
is. There has been some disagreement on part of this (some think RSA and
triple DES secure right now, though they acknowledge DES to be weak against
current technology). Nevertheless, since nobody who can say knows what NSA
can actually do, I make that assumption.

Thus I'm assuming Clipper is secure absent key escrow, and alternatives
publicly available, I'm assuming, may not be. Now the bad guys don't know
anything more than I do about the inside workings of the NSA, so they might
assume the same thing for safety--they have a lot more at risk than I do.

Thus if Clipper were thought secure, and available without escrow either
through publishing the algorithm, or making the chips reverse-engineerable
(again a subject of speculative disagreement here), the bad guys would grab
their own version of Clipper without the escrow, and have a putatively
secure system.

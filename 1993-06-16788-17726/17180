   Someone was asking about the FEAL encryption scheme a while back.  I
just ran across an article in the Crypto 91 procedings.  I don't have the
article title here, but the results were:
 
   A known-plaintext attack on FEAL-4 requiring 1000 known-plaintexts.
   A known-plaintext attack on FEAL-6 requiring 20000 known plaintexts.
 
   Biham and Shamir also worked out that FEAL-4 could be broken using
I think 8 chosen plaintexts.  (I haven't read that article closely, because
I'm trying to work out a differential attack on FEAL-4 on my own.  It's
surprisingly easy to trace differentials through multiple rounds of the
FEAL F function.)

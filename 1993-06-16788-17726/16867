DON'T call for PGP toys from my system any time this week, and likely next.
The system is DOWN, due to a motherboard video-related problem (among others).
Serves me right for buying mailorder, with a 1yr warranty (it's been 1
year and 2 months.  Of course.)  NitV should be up and running and all
the crypto files available again within a couple weeks.  Blagh.  
Of course, what REALLY must've happened is the SS sneaked into my house in
the middle of the night and ran a magnet over my BIOS...  >;)

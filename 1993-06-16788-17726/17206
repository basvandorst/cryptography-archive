You sound very sure. On what is that assuredness based?

If you think about it for an minute or two, it has to be most unlikely, 
mustn't it? OTP use is slow and error-prone. Hand carriage is also slow. Do 
you REALLY believe that the world's diplomatic traffic could rely mainly on 
such methods? Do think about it.

Would someone care to post why this fixation with the use of OTP surfaces 
again and again? Is it because those who, perforce, have to gain any 
information on governmental ciphers and cipher practice from books that can 
be bought in the local store believe that all that is written is the whole 
truth. Is it because of an unwillingness to conceive that natural intellect 
and a good academic education are insufficient, in themselves, to provide a 
adequate information base in every area of expertise?

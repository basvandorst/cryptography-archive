Yes David, let's be clear.  If you had quoted the original posting (and of
course you haven't because it does not back up your claims), everyone would
be able to read that the original poster mentioned that he *personally* would
not be buying DD's books because he didn't like her opinions and that he
urged others to *consider* whether or not they should do likewise.

The original poster most emphatically did not advocate an organized boycott
(and he is no position to enforce such even if he had proposed such).  You
are, yet again, willfully mis-interpreting other people's postings to your
own ends.

The only thing on this echo that resembles Hitler's book burnings is your
own pathetic attempts to railroad opinion using ill-conceived, emotive and
irrational arguments.

to laughing at this misguided individual.

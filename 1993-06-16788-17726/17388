       At least for now, this is so.  There is no published way to break
DES that is significantly faster than brute force (trying all 2^56 keys)
and no off-the-shelf computer, even existing supercomputers, is fast enough
to do this by that approach.  No one has ever published a DES break of
even a single message that I know of.

       But it's possible to build a special-purpose hardware machine,
one about the size of a mainframe computer, that can break DES in a day
or so.  It's generally assumed that the major government players in the 
cryptographic business have done so.

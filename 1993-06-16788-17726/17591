This assumes that phones cannot be easily reprogrammed or modified to
do "nonstandard" things. As Tsutomu Shimomura and friends have shown
with the ROMs in various cellular phones, this is not a good
assumption.

Remember that Clipper is just a digital encryption chip. The actual
encryption task is not a big deal anymore for most modern
microprocessors or even some microcontrollers. A secure phone requires
much more than encryption.  The real problem is getting the voice data
rate down to what an ordinary phone modem can handle.

This requires a good vocoder, which is not (yet) a cheap mass-market
technology. Digital cellular is about to change this, as would a
mass-market Clipper phone. Eventually they'll make it much easier to
build *good* (non-Clipper) secure phones, either by adding real
encryption software to a Clipperphone, or building your own out of the
same parts, perhaps on PC option cards to keep the costs down.

I envision the widespread use of souped-up Clipperphones that can
operate both in secure mode (for general use) and compromised mode
(for talking to the government, and those sheep deathly afraid of it).

This is it.

If the RNG is good enough, (say, DES in CFB mode with an IV that's
derived from the key) then all you'd need to do would be to XOR the
output with the plaintext.

If the RNG is lousy, then the algorithm is lousy.

If your RNG is a LFSR, it's going to be breakable.

If you don't understand the acronyms I'm using, then you should get
the Frequently-Asked-Questions list for this group and look in the
bibliography; there are some good books there.  Most university
libraries have a 'courtesy borrower' program, where you pay $50 for
borrowing privileges.  You're apparently in Chicago; hardly a hick
town.

It's not a system called 'X Windows', it's a window system named 'X',
after the owl on "Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood".

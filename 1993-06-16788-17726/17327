There's a lot of radio signals in the air that are usually attributed to 
diplomatic services. Embassies often have some antennas which don't look 
as if they were used for the purpose of entertaining the guards on night 
shift with satellite-tv. And newspaper reports (which are, of course, as 
unreliable as all the information which was related in this thread) 
have described the efforts of the former Soviet Union et al. to deploy 
antennas and receivers vis-a-vis some embassies in order to catch up as 
many radiowaves as they could get ;-) . 

OTP's and agents with black briefcases handcuffed to their wrists might 
still exist in the diplomatic world, but I'd guess the capacity, the 
time delay, the cost and particular vulnerabilities of this channel are 
good enough reasons to use cryptography and radio signals (via satellite 
and also conventional short-wave as a fallback).

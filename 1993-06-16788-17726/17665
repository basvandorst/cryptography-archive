I'd also be willing to co-moderate. A "filtered" version of sci.crypt
would have considerable value for those without either the time or
inclination to wade through all of the political discussion.

As for more unmoderated newsgroups, people will just crosspost.
Witness all of the articles crossposted between sci.crypt,alt.privacy,
alt.privacy.clipper,comp.security.misc,alt.security,alt.security.pgp &c.

At least one moderator should reside outside the U.S. and Canada
in case any sort of source code postings are contemplated. (I don't
think that source is really the most appropriate thing for 
sci.crypt.tech, but on the other hand, I see no reason not to
leave the option for short and particularly important postings of 
source or pseudocode).

We are all indebted to Mr. Sternlight for sharing his views.  Could
he possibly help us by sharing the sources of his beliefs, i.e. the
sources and facts requested by Mr. Dupree?  Particularly about charter,
legal authorities, etc.  We'd also be fascinated if Mr. Sternlight could
tell us a few of the things that he has gotten from the NSA's public
information office.  Most of us have never contacted it.

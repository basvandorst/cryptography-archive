I don't INSIST, and I didn't once mention DES.  Various guesses of the cost
of systematically cracking DES have been posted here, and even the more
conservative upper bounds put the task well within NSA's range.

The notion that the current unclassified non-Clipper systems are insecure
against NSA  ***AND*** it's counterparts, has appeared here more than once,
without a shred of evidence.  I presented one (1, uno, single, mono) bit of
evidence which suggests that at the very least, the "and" in this this
assumption is suspect. (And this is all that's necessary to cast doubt on
Sternlight's "unrefuted" working hypothesis about the US government's
motivation for introducing the Clipper chip).

Comparability of NSA and KGB (or rather, KGB+GRU), and estimates of NSA
capabilities, are separate issues.  I don't have sufficient information to
make any serious claims about these points.  However, lacking any other
evidence, which assumption would *you* prefer?   That the NSA is, or isn't,
in any way comparable to similarly constituted organizations of similar
size and (in manpower anyway) resources?  WHAT is it about the NSA that
should have us assume that adding some extra bits to one's crypto keys
would not stymie them, in the face of all publically available evidence
(theoretical and otherwise) which suggests that it would?  Something in the
water perhaps??

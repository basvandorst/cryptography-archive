Is there a theory of administrative domains around?  By this, I mean the
kind of thing that digital signatures and encryption and access control
lists are supposed to be modelling at a more abstract level.  I suspect
that someone has modelled entities and permissions in (say) an algebra
or something, but I've never heard of such a thing.

I'm looking for ideas on how to handle privledges and permissions as
part of a language, other than a capability-based system (which just
pushes it back onto the programmer).  

Thanks in advance for any info/references!

I agree with both you guys.  And so does the Senate - remember the
demo of cell-phone hacking that was shown to congress a month or so
ago?  They got a special disposition for the kid to do it without
being arrested; they *didn't* bother to get one for the demo of importing
DES code from Europe by ftp, because it wasn't needed.  If crypto
import *is* illegal, then one of your senators is guilty of doing it...

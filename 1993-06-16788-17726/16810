Not certain of the exact operation, but the method outlined above is the one 
used by the British Army for encryption of field communications. Every night in
a CommCen the FOS (Foreman of Signals) issues new card sets to the operatives
of the secure data encryption vehicles. The cards in the racks are replaced and
the old ones returned to the FOS who is accountable for them - and their 
destruction. 

	The cards operate in sets of SIX inside VERY bulky equipment sealed
with allen bolts and the wagon permanently locked tight and the operatives
armed with sub-machine guns.

	The operatives sign the cards in and out, and loss of a card is an
immediate court-martial offence.....

	I worked on these vehicles and eqipment for 3 years in the forces.
(Ten years ago I might add - just so the O.S. bozos don't start jumping up
and down!)

Well I don't own a copy, but I did read it at the library and enjoyed it.
If you keep up with the crypto literature you wouldn't appreciate it as
much because it is mostly an anthology of previously-published stuff.

One thing in it I found especially significant - and I should have copied
it to use in future debates - is his information about the bombing of
Coventry, and refuting the allegation that Churchill deliberately sacrificed
Coventry to protect the Ultra secret.  This comes up from time to time in
various historical and military newsgroups.

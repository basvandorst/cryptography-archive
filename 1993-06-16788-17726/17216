  Barring some really fundamental -mathematical- breakthrough, shaving off
a few orders of magnitude from the time it takes to factor large numbers won't
make any real difference.  Factoring a 1024-bit number using the best available
methods with the fastest available computers might be speeded up from 1 billion
years to a mere 1 million years -- both of which are plenty of time to keep
a secret.
  Also, faster computers will allow encryption users to use longer keys;
again, barring some fundamental mathematical breakthrough, increasing one's
key length slightly adds only a slight burden to one's own computer while
adding orders of magnitude to the burden on anyone trying to factor the key.

NP stands for ``nondeterministic polynomial'': it is the set of
existence problems for which any ``yes'' answer has a polynomial-time 
proof.

There is no reason to believe this. ``Polynomial-time'' has to do with 
asymptotics; the speed of a real-life computation has nothing to do with 
asymptotics.

There is no mathematical evidence for any of the following statements:
factoring is hard, factoring is easy, P = NP, P != NP.

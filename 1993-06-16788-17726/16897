I have a file that was created using PFS Write, and then password
protected.  The software encrypted the file when the password was
assigned and now cannot be read.  The creator of the file has forgotten
what her password was and contacted PFS.  The told her that it would
take 2 weeks for them to un-encrypt her file.
Does anyone know of a utility that might do this for her.

Any help would be appreciated.

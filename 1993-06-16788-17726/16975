I second the opinion.  Whatever you think of Dorothy Denning's
opinions about government, cryptography control and law enforcement,
she has shown herself to be very capable of polite discussion (not to
mention writing good education material on cryptography).  Personal
attacks on her are not useful and will serve only to alienate and make
reasoned discussion harder.

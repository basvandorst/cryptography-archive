Wrong.

The algorithm has not been revealed, so it can't be evaluated.

If you make the wrong choices for the S-boxes, DES can be weakened.
How can we tell for ourselves that Clipper hasn't been weakened in an
analogous manner?  We can't.

Anybody could cook up a summary that would make the algorithm look
good.  We need to see the actual algorithm to tell if it's any good --
and we would need to see an actual clipper phone to tell if it's any
good.

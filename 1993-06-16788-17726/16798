     Then you need to read it again.  Look, we have ~25,000 students
on this campus.  There is no way anyone can vouch for the behavior of
each and every one of them being ethical.  Add to that the fact that
non-students can walk into the labs and sit down in front of a networked
pee cee.  We do not see the point of having an armed guard checking
photo I.D.'s or any such nonsense.  What I wrote simply states that it
is the university's responsibility to do at least a minimal amount to
restrict access to the Internet via the university's facilities to
legitimate users.  Let me say it again another way.  We don't want
people, especially unidentified people, using our facilities to launch
attacks on other organizations' facilities.

     I doubt they have been using the Internet for twenty years.  Also,
there have been plenty of well documented cases of corporate systems
invaded by way of their connections to the Internet.
     Let me check something here...hmmm...I see that tanda.isis.org.
has no A RR's in the name server data, so it probably is not on the
Internet.  Perhaps that is why you don't seem to get the point of what
I wrote.

     I have no idea why you feel that my credentials as a pilot would
say anything at all about limiting access to the Internet at large to
authenticating and/or secured hosts.  If your comment is meant as a
personal attack of some peculiar kind, please take it to email.

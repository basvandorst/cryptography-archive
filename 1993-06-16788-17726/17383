I have a friend visiting Zurich in the next few days and I'd like
him to get hold of some IDEA encryption chips for experimentation.
If it is at all possible, I'd like somebody from ETH to mail me
details as to the availability of these chips, their price, and
where in Zurich (or elsewhere) they can be got hold of.

There may be some difficulty importing these into South Africa (lots
of paranoia still around), but I'm willing to risk losing them, I
just hope that doesn't get anybody out there into trouble...

Thanks.

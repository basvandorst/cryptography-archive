As a thought experiment, I've heard the same story most others have
that DES was intentionally weakened by being given a 64-bit key, instead
of 128-bits, or more.  Now while it's hard to change a silicon implimentation
(i.e. re-wire a chip), can DES be extended to 128-bits in software
implementations, or does the method not allow for this type of extension?

And if it doesn't allow for this type of extension, how could it ever
have been considered in the first place?

Just my random thoughts.

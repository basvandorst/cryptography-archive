PGP 2.3 is now available.  This is mostly a bug-fix release, with the
most notable bug being in the MS-DOS version of PGP 2.2.  The compression
code freed a bad pointer, resulting in memory corruption with unpredictable
effects.  Mostly, nothing happened.  Sometimes, PGP produced a bad file.
Sometimes it would crash.  This has, of course, been fixed.  Other bugs
that affect all platforms have also been fixed. 

See doc/newfor23.doc in the release for the full details.

Availability

Thinking of the U.S. Defence Trade Regulations' (formerly International
Traffic in Arms Regulations) phrasing "available from libraries open to
the public," I have placed PGP (MS-DOS format) in the Canadian Broadcasting
Corporation library.  Contact Max Allen at +1 416 205-6017 for assistance.

The archive files are pgp23.zip, pgp23src.zip, and pgp23.tar.Z.  The latter
two have identical contents, except that the .zip file has CRLF line endings
for text files.

They are available now from:
src.doc.ic.ac.uk:computing/security/pgp
ghost.dsi.unimi.it:/tmp, will be moved to pub/security
nic.funet.fi: has been uploaded, awaiting a permanent home
ftp.uunet.ca:/tmp, awaiting a permanent home
ftp.cs.toronto.edu:/tmp

The signatures on the PGP distribution files follow.

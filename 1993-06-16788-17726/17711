I recommend that you look at an LZ encoded file.  The compression
doesn't kick in effectively until some amount of plaintext is
encoded inefficiently.  The entropy of the first few bytes of an LZ
file is very low for typical text.

If you were designing a compression algorithm from scratch to cause
the data to look random, even from the beginning, you might want to
preload the dictionary with some known similar plaintext.

Last but not least, the headers of standard compressed data formats
are *VERY* predictable.  ZIP files will always begin with:
[50] [4B] [03] [04].  If you're trying to break data you believe may
have been encoded with ZIP, just look for those bytes.

The key to using compression as a means of obscuring your data from
an attack would be to design the format yourself, and do it right.
Both LZ77 and LZ78 contain obvious redundancies in the initial output.

Keep in mind that if an opponent has both encrypted file 'a', and
unencrypted plaintext 'b' (even if 'b' is compressed in some cool
format) then an attack doesn't require any cleverness.  A good
encryption format should be able to withstand an attack when a
sample of the encrypted data and plaintext are both available.

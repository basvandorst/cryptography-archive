No, it's paranoid baloney. Jim Bidzos, president of PKP, has said that one
could use RSAREF (RSA's software routines for executing their patent for
non-commercial purposes) to write a "legal" version of PGP. According to
several posts a group is hard at work doing just that, with his blessing.

There is also a non-commercial version of RSA called RIPEM, using DES. It is
written in such a way that you could drop in IDEA instead of DES if you
wanted to do the work. All PGP is is RSA+IDEA.

Note that the above comments apply to U.S. and  Canada only.

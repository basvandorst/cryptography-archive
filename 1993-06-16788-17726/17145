Require that all surveillance warrants be published after a period of one year.

I suggested this in an earlier post, and the same idea was floated in the
`Sunday Times' yesterday. There is no reason why applications for surveillance 
should be the only legal hearings whose very existence remains secret from the 
accused for all time.

Publicity will not stop all abuses, but it will raise the cost enormously: you
won't be able to use the same tame judge more than once or twice without landing
him in trouble and thus risking that he'll give you away.

Here in the UK it's slightly different as these warrants are signed by the Home 
Secretary himself. Thus if someone has nobbled one of the officials who advise
him, there is no obvious recourse as these officials are never identified,

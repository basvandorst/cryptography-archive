Arrrgh.  Once more with feeling.  You need not use ONE CD as the one
time pad -- you can XOR *many* CDs and use the result as a one time
pad.  If you do so, your keyspace becomes approximately <number of CDs
in print> to the Nth power.  The keyspace can be substantially larger
if you use the relative timing of different CD selections as part of
the key, which will provide 15 to 20 bits or so of additional keyspace
for each additional CD used.

If you use the least significant bits of the data, the entropy, after
XORs will be acceptably high -- or you can use reduce the data rate
and increase the entropy using a variety of well known techniques.

Of course, you don't really have a one time pad when you are done with
this, but you do have a very secure encryption system, and one which
requires no custom manufactured CDs or random number generators.

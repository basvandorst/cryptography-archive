Get real.  Nobody's advocating banning Dr. Denning or restricting her
behavior.  He's just talking about thinking about the social consequences
of one's personal decisions.  Fortunately for me i bought her book a few
years ago, so i don't have to worry about that particular moral quandry.

Now, back to Dr. Denning's credentials.  Last night i was downloading
information about Computer Professional for Social Responsibility from
the Well and i saw the name "Dorothy Denning" under one of the board
members or advisors lists.  Could this be the same Dorothy Denning?

What conspiracy is going on here?  Is Dr. Denning secretly working to
advance the causes of CPSR by pretending to be believe in the Clipper
chip proposal?  Is she really working to sabotage the governments efforts
by making them more visible?

Or is CPSR a CIA front organization?  Does Dr. Denning advise them in
order to weaken their positions so that the public will think that
a fair debate on the Clipper chip occurred, when in fact only bogus
anti-Clipper chip argues were ever put forward?

Or could it be that reasonable people sometimes disagree?  Nah, that's
too uninteresting.

I disagree.  It is, however, much easier to obtain and use strong 
cryptography than in the 19th century, to be sure.

The design and implementation of cryptographic quality pseudorandom number 
generators is quite difficult for amateurs, actually, unless they have a very 
strong background in discrete mathematics and information theory (in which 
case they're not quite amateurs any more).

[shell archive deleted...]

Of course, if you don't use a UNIX machine, then the shell archive is
probably worthless.

ROT-13 encryption/decryption is simply a 13 step caesarian cypher.  This
means that every letter is shifted forward by 13 letters, so 'a' goes to
'n', 'b' goes to 'o'...'m' goes to 'z', 'n' goes to 'a'...'z' goes to
'm'.

This has the advantage that encryption is the same as decryption, so
decoding a ROT-13 message is as simple as reencoding it.  It has the
severe disadvantage that it is useless for encrypting anything secret.
The only thing it is used for is keeping people from accidentally
reading what they might not want to read.

Here is a table accurately describing ROT-13.  YOu can use it to write
your own program...

plaintext:  abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
ROT-13   :  nopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmNOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLM
                 All other characters passed unmodified.

Hope this helps...

  Later,
    BP

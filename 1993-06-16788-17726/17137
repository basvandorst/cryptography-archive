   I've been working on how product ciphers work (in information-theoretic
terms) as part of studying differential attacks on them.  I've been trying
to figure something out.  Is there a maximum number or rounds / subkeys
such that any more rounds won't increase security (for a given round function)?
 
   It seems like there would be some limit, in the sense that you'd eventually
be unable to add anymore uncertainty about the input to the next round of
encryption.  But I can't see how to prove it.  I also seem to recall seeing
something about this regarding DES--something along the lines of the DES
S-boxes not being able to add anymore entropy beyond 16 rounds.
 
   If this isn't true, why wouldn't it make sense to work out an extended
key-scheduling algorithm for a 128-bit key for DES, and then have it run
through enough rounds to use up all those additional subkeys to increase
the difficulty of differential attacks beyond that of 128-bit keysearch?
 
   If it *is* true, then how would triple-DES add significant amounts of
security?

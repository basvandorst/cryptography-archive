We know this is untrue. One-time pads are theoretically more secure, just
for one example. RSA is, as has been described here, breakable with public
knowledge for shorter keys. We don't know about 1024 bit keys if there's a
breakthrough in factoring at the NSA.

Probably true if you mean that a)Clipper-type algorithms are, at present,
infeasible to crack and b) the NSA would keep any algorithm it couldn't
crack secret to prevent the bad guys from using it.

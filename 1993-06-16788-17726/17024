More generally, this raises the questions:

1. Who, if anyone, do you trust?

2. Who, if anyone, _must_ you trust?

I don't have general objections to systems based on trust, provided _I_
can select whom to trust.  For instance, a key escrow account system
where I could deposit my keys with Amnesty International and the ACLU.

(BTW, this sharply restricts the use of trust in large public systems.
Finding a group that everyone trusts is probably impossible).

I do have general objections to systems where I must trust someone
identified by a third party, and to a large extent I refuse to partici-
pate in these systems.  (There are exceptions, e.g. a creditor dealing
with a credit bureau).

Clipper clearly falls in the second category.  They do not offer a
selection of chips/algorithms offered by different groups, they offer
_one_ chip/algorithm.  They do not offer a selection of key escrow
account administrators, they specify both administrators.

Even this would not be a problem -- I would simply choose to not use
anything based on Clipper technology -- but there are hints we may be
forced to choose between Clipper and nothing.

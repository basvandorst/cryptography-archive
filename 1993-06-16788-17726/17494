I'm not an expert in this, but I thought the definition of "random" was that
a sequence is random if it cannot be generated by an algorithm shorter than
the sequence itself.  By this definition, the sequence generated by rolling a
die is random, but if we're told it's always 1, it isn't random.

I was told this in contrast to "normal", which means all sequences of any
given length occur equiprobably.  For example, the decimal expansion of \pi
is certainly not random, but (I think the speculation is that) it is normal.

BTW, can anyone confirm this speculation?  How about for e, etc.?

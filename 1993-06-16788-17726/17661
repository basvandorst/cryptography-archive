Correction: PEM isn't an option inside of the United States and
probably some other countries.  (Same result, unfortunately.)  If you
live outside of the reach of PKP's lawyers, there's nothing stopping
you from writing, distributing, and using your own PKE software.

So Kerberos is a good option for within a site (i.e., to decide if a
user is local, and if so to find out who they are) ; I seem to
remember a version 4 library call that would turn a (ticket,
authenticator) into an ASCII blob that could be safely transmitted
without worrying about zapping an unsuspecting entity on the other
end.  However, one must keep in mind that it /is/ trusted-third-party,
with all the advantages and disadvantages that such a scheme has.
This has certain serious implications for using it to verify remote
users in realms you possibly may never have heard of---the technology
isn't there yet.(*)

(*)Yes, I know that you can do inter-realm authentication.  The
problem lies in choosing and validating the inter-realm path to verify
wollman.@emba.uvm.edu to http.info-server@cc.podunk.edu.au.  I'm
certain that this is nothing new to the Kerberos people...

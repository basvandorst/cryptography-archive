I agree that sci.crypt has gotten to be a -much- noisier newsfroup.
By all means, if somebody wants to do a real vote counting, I'd
certainly go for it.

See books on Kolmogorov/Chaitin complexity for one interesting
definition of randomness, and also

as a starter.  In security related work, what is important is whether
a poly-time adversary can guess the next bit in a sequence with a more
than 1/2+epsilon chance of success.

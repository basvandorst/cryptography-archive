  That hardly seems likely; targets of legal prosecution are comeplled to
produce evidence in various forms all the time.  It just has to be done
under certain legal limitations, and in the light of day, and hence protects
the 4th and 5th amendment rights of suspects better than a secret algorithm
with an escrow system which can be abused in secret.

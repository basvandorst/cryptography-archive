Hello!

I have been reading this forum for some time now, and as I did
not find this question in your FAQ file I hope someone would take
their time to answer this question:

How safe is the password protection built into ZIP (also ARJ, etc)
file compression utilities? Are they safe enough for "normal"
security, or are they so easy to break you can find utilities that
unlocks ZIP files like there are for WordPerfect?

Does anyone know how they work (Xor with password, etc)?
Answers would me much appreciated (mail and/or news). Thank you.

Regards
J. S. Haugland

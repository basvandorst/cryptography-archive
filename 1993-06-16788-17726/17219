The original post made reference to the NSA having tapes lying around of
(currently) unbreakable encrypted comms.

It seems to me that since faster computers would only enable bigger keys
that RSA itself will not be compromised. What *will* be compromised is
something that the NSA may have gathered now that uses a smaller key. What
is unpractical to waste 10yrs breaking today, will be worth 10hrs five years
from now.

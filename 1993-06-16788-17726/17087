Let me ("the 'other' May" in this thread) point something out: it is
not at all illegal in the United States to organize a boycott of a
product, or a business, or a service.

True, there are some disturbing trends in the RICO laws
(Racketeer-Influence and COrrupt practices Act..the painful name was
picked to suggest Latin drug dealers), which may allow aggressive
prosecutors to claim "conspiracies" exist. The Founding Fathers will
spin in their graves!

And the government may block companies from complying with the Arab
boyucott of Israel, for example. 

But aside from these situations, the KKK is free to advocate the
boycotting of books by blacks, the Muslims are free to advocate the
boycotting of Salman Rushdie's novels, and blacks are free to advocate
the boycotting of Denny's. 

(It's a sad commentary on the American system that a large black group
which *did* publically advocate the boycotting of Denny's would
probably face various legal and regulatory pressures to halt this,
even though the basic right is clear. The problem is that we have
granted "organizations," different rights than individuals have. Most
of these issues end up court, which should not be the case.)

The essence of free speech is that folks in this group not be censored
by the government and that they be free to advocate pretty much
anything.

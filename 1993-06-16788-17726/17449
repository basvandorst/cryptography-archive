I understand from a colleague that NetWare from Novell now includes a
security and encryption scheme. From what I can gather from him this
uses a combination of both public and private key algorithms.

Can anyone enlighten me (and the rest of the group?) with more details
of the security scheme employed?

Thanks in advance

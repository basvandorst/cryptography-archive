While waiting for Herman Rubin's informed answer, I'll give you mine,
specialized to the case of a time series.

A time series is random (for me) if, at any point in the series, I don't 
know what the next thing in the series is going to be.  Period.  A similar 
definition could be given for "randomness" of any other kind of mass 
phenomenon.

It doesn't matter how good a bet I might be able to make about the next thing 
in the series; if I can't be certain, then it's random (to me).

Note that (unlike Rubin) I don't make my living by knowing what "random" should 
mean.  I've adopted this usage after a casual reading of deFinetti, and am 
ready to be chastened.

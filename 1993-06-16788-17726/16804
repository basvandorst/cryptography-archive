Is it possible to decode the password in the passwordfile on
UN*X systems. If i don't remember all wrong there is the two first 
characters in the password that are used as the random value fed
into DES.
Is it possible by just going backword trace the password ??
Is it also possible to try all possible combination starting with
aa ab ac .... zy zz and then check for words.

If these are silly questions or this is information that are 
secrets, just ignore it  all, and forget it.

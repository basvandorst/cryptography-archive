Not exactly an oxymoron.  I believe that there is a distinction between
pseudo-random and unpredictability.  Unpredictability is the prime
cryptographic requirement for a successful one-time pad.  Pseudo-randomness
is merely a vehicle normally used to achieve that unpredictability.

As an example, the Russians  (KGB & GRU) used one-time pads that were
prepared by armies of typists just banging away at their keyboards.  The
resulting pads were distinctly unrandom, however they were sufficiently
_unpredicatable_ that they fulfilled all the cryptographic requirements
of a one-time pad  (I believe that the source of this information was
one of Kahn's books).

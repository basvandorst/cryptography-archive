There are two federal standards for compressed voice, LPC-10e and CELP.
The vocoders operate at 2400 and 4800 baud respectively.  Additionally
tactical secure voice systems (KY-57/TSEC) operate at 16 KB or w/NATO
12 KB using Continuously Variable Slope Delta (CVSD) modulation.  Adaptive
Delta Pulse Coded Modulation (ADPCM) is supposed to produce toll quallity
speech using 32 KB.

Codebook Excited Linear Prediction (CELP) is gaining wide acceptance.

Voice compression schemes take advantages of statistical properties 
and/or redundancy in speech.  The major difficulty is that there is
a inverse correspondence between the baud rate and the amount of
processing required for higher rates of compression.  Qualcomm in
San Diego offers their QCELP chip which will operate as low as
4800 baud or can operate at a variable rate for compression/storage
purposes.  The cost is prohibitive for the average hobbyist.  For
lower quality digitized speech try CVSD at 9600 baud.  It would
require little power, little hardware and the modem costs are fairly
low.

Philco Ford used to produce the KY-585, a vocoder that would operate
at either 1200 or 2400 baud.  In 2400 baud mode it was HY-2 compatible.
The form factor was 1/4 ATR (avionics package).  The speech quality
is slightly inferior to LPC-10.  CVSD at 9600 baud provides better
voice quality than the HY-2.

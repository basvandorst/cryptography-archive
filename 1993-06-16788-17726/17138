Please forgive me for including all of the publication list again.
However I think it is illuminating. The Clipper proposal and the
FBI Digital Network proposal will have major effects on the shape
of telecommunication networks in the US (and through that the rest of the
world). There is nothing here in Denning's publications showing that she has
anything more than a layperson's knowledge of telecommunications.

Clipper and the Digital Network proposal can if implemented, impose severe
restrictions on network and telecommunication technological progress.
The impact of these proposals on the RBOC's , CPE providers, private
networks etc should all be analyzed closely. They can have significant
economic impact on these industries.

Dr. Denning is apparently well qualified to discuss the cryptographic
aspects of Clipper. I wish tht there were others as qualified to discuss
the telecommunications aspect.

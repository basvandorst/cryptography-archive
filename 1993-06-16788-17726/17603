I apologize for referring to the political discussion as "ranting".
Personally, I find it very interesting myself.

However, while the "context" of cryptography may be political, the
science itself is not.  I think it is eminently reasonable to want a
low-volume group for discussion of research issues alone, and I think
"sci.crypt" is an eminently reasonable name for that group.

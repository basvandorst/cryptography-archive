No, my reading of Denning is that if it's not brought to market now, the
need for some security will cause DES to be used instead, with much weaker
security for our private business. I think most people agree that DES is no
longer secure against determined adversaries--one estimate here is that a
special purpose device would cost $25 per message to break. That will drop
sharply in the next year or two--we're now seeing very cheap RISC chips
becoming mass market items.

Some here think triple DES might be more secure. Though I've read their
arguments, since I have no idea what goes on at the NSA technologically, I'm
not inspired with confidence.

Let me cut right through here to the core of SOME of the disagreements about
Clipper. I consider it to be MY government, and I trust it a la Mark Twain's
"Trust everybody and always cut the cards." Thus I take at face value the
government's implied statement that alternatives known publicly aren't
secure and clipper is. Others may disagree, or at least raise questions, as
is their right.

Given my assumptions, the problem becomes preventing the bad guys from
getting really secure communications. Hence the secrecy of the algorithm,
the protection of the chip, and the key escrow with court order.

It seems to me the government is trying to go pretty far in giving us the
NSA's better stuff, and riding on my assumptions, I'll take it. You don't
have to, and shouldn't be forced to.

Even if all other systems are less secure, this is not necessarily the
case.  The reason is that one can combine many systems.  It will cost
more, but in many cases, the cost of the cryptography is well worth it.

We know that one-time pads give perfect security, but require a secret
key as long as the message.  However, a 1008-bit secret key will power
18 DES processes, and if a Shamir or other equally strong pseudo-random
number system is used with it to generate a pseudo-one-time-pad this is
going to be quite hard to crack.  And if this is not strong enough, add
another stage.

There is nothing intrinsically difficult in using another system with
Clipper.  This is what should be done, instead of relying on the government
to provide security.

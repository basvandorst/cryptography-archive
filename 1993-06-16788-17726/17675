To emphasise the point, outside the US the patent is void on almost every
count :-

1) It consists entirely of a mathematical method, these are specifically
	excluded from patent protection.

2) The patent was only applied for after the method was published.

3) The patent has expired ! (first published in 1974, thus any patent
	would have expired in 1988).

4) The patent is broader than the work of the patent holders, specifically it
	has a claim for *any* public key encryption system. 


Since CERN has international institute status and staff are covered for
their actions as parts of their job by diplomatic immunity PKP can't
even run a nuisance suit. It seems to me that situations like this where a
patent has been granted in order to prevent work in the field is precisely
the area for which the special status was created.

Remember that WWW allows more than one authentification scheme to be used.
However it is obviously a good idea to ensure that there is consistency.
Ie we don't want two incompatible implementations of a kerberos scheme.

Currently I desperately need an authentification scheme for my code
management system server. Currently I am writing a "put" server but in
order to use this one has to get the security right!!!

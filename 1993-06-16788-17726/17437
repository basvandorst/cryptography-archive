Naively one might assume that a 64 bit key is cracked 2^64 times
faster than a 2^128 bit key.  A 64 bit is probably being cracked not by a 
dumb search but it is probably reasonable to assume that the number
of operations to crack a 128 bit key is at least 
  (number of operations to crack a 64 bit key) ^ 2.
If the encryption algorithm is not one where this relationship between
key length and number of computations to break is not true then the 
encyption IS weak. IMHO.
So lets think about these numbers 
128 bit -> 2 days
64 bit  -> 1/2 hour  ratio 48. Thus it takes 48 computation to crack
a 64 bit key. Sorry no banana.

If it takes ONLY two days to crack a a 128 bit key then it will take
about 1.728e13 operation on a 100 mip machine. Surely NSA has at least
on of them. Sqrt of this is 4.157 e6 On a 100 mip machine this takes
41 ms.  
Moral  64 bit keys are sort of safe    32 bit keys are probably garbage
breakable with an abacus.

Reverse. 64 bit key 1/2 hour. 100 mip machine . 1.8 e111 operations.
=> 128 bit key 3.24 e22 operations = 10 million years :)
adavnces in tech knowlegy optical computers etc = 9999 GIP computer
(100 000 times faster than a 100 mip computer)
time to crack  102 years.   Guess what the patent ran out first.

The point is where an encryption takes Bits ^ N time to crack
doubling the key size from 64 to 128 bits is not just a bit of
extra security. It is a whole bundle.

If anyone has a cracking method for an encryption method where
it does not take Key Bits ^ N time then the encyption method is
not any good for anything except a false sense of security.

Left as as exercise for the reader gues the approximate volume
of  2^38 grains of sand Work it out.
guess the volume of 2^76 grains of sand  work it out :)
Look up how many molecule of h20 there are in 18 grams of water.

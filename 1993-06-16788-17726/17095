Yeah, and maybe they'll be able to get the space station up... Notice
how well the current system is working. :)
But, really - how much of a say do you or I have about the space
station, anyway? (And now its a $5 billion waste)

But I think a better comparision would be SDI ("Star Wars" for the
stupid) Most of that was secret - but it was known to the public, which,
for the most part, seemed to consider it a waste of money.  In that
case, I think that a system could have been developed "behind doors"
better than in the public eyes. (Well, SDI was just supposed to be the
tech vehicle for the future defenive system, but that went unrecognised)

Uh, no, we do not intend to throw you into the briar patch. :)
When the gov't. *denies* that they're going to do something.. before the
question comes up, that makes me a little suspicious....

Yeah, well, remember quite a lot of things that we take for granted were
done in the same fashion..... The Govt. using tax dollars to develop
stuff that later trickled down to the public..

Sure it does! If I knew that they were, I'd do my best to complicate
things.. Even totalitarianers want to make things *easy* for themselves.

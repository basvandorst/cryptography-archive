Who he? Not me!

The post to which I responded was pretty categoric, both on the universal 
use of OTP for diplomatic traffic anf the use of the diplomatic pouch for 
transmission of the product. Both of which statements do not stand up well 
to examination from first principles.

There ought to be some award for creative thinking here :)

My frustration lies in those postings that either state or imply that OTP, 
so simple and perfect in theory, is a fine, useful cipher system for 
general use. AFAIK, it ain't. If it was, why ever does the world choose to use 
almost anything else whenever it can?

Theoretical discussions, whether about OTP or the number of angels 
that can stand on the head of a pin, are perfectly fine, so long as wish is 
*made* reality and is not simply stated to be so.

I have a few minor additions to that; the Borland makefile has the
same problem.

the file src/makefile.tc was not updated completely; if you make pgp23
by renaming "makefile.tc" to "makefile" and than running "make all" in
the Turbo C environment, you will note that "rsaglue.obj" is not produced.

Adding "rsaglue.obj" to the lines with the 

OBJ1 = pgp.obj crypto.obj etcetera     definition solves the problem.

Should you now or in a future version of pgp decide to change makefile.tc
you might also change some initial comment lines to reflect Borland's
change of the productname Turbo C into Borland C. I suggest something like:

# makefile for PGP (Turbo C and Borland C)
# For Turbo C 2.0 type "make all"; for Borland C 3.0 first change the line
# "CC = tcc"  into  "CC = bcc"
# Make sure there are no non-pgp .obj files in this directory.


Another insignificant change proposal concerns the file src/idea.c
It contains a testdriver for idea encryption, normally commented out
of the compilation by an #ifdef TEST. The procedure void main(void)
at three locations uses the number "64", reflecting the number of
iterations necessary to encrypt a kilobyte of testdata. IDEA encrypts
64-bits in one block; so not 64 but 128 encryptions are necessary for
one kilobyte? Of course this in no way affects PGP's security; it just
suggests IDEA is twice as fast as it really is in the timing results of
the testdriver.

I'd like to obtain a simple substitution-cipher solver which will use a 
dictionary to come up with possible solutions that match the input letter
patterns.  I've got a few ideas about how to program one, but before I do, I'd
like to make sure that there isn't one out there already.

(If this is on the FAQ please beat me electronically as is appropriate.)

Thanks in advance.

You need a set of one-time pads for _each_ of your correspondents, and
they likewise.

Assume you need secure communications with 10 people.  You need 10
_different_ OTPs, and there will be (10 C n) different disks when
you account for all permutations, where n is the number of people holding
"conference" conversations.  For n = 2, this is 45 disks for 10 people.

Increase that to 100 people, and you're talking about 4950 disks.

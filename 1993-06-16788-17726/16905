OK, having read the sci.crypt FAQ, I'm still wondering:  Is
there any good reason to believe that "triple-DES" via (e.g.)
the FIPS E(K1,D(K2,E(K1,x))) has some special flaw which makes
it less secure than some optimal product cipher with a 112 bit
key?  (This question is not well-phrased, but hopefully the
intent is clear.)

(Obviously, the reason I ask is that, if not, then even if the
"PowerPC" takes only a day to brute-force break a DES message,
it should take o(2^52) ~= o(10^15) days to brute-force break a
FIPS triple-DES message.  Thus, I'm not too worried about the
obtaining any hypothetical extra security of Skipjack against
brute-force attack.)

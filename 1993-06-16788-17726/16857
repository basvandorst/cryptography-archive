I am told that the instructions which I previously posted for picking up
TIS/PEM by ftp are out of date. Apparently TIS is using security through
stupidity as a way to encourage people to read the unenforceable TIS/PEM
license.

To get around the s-t-s, I am told, you grab ftp.tis.com:pub/PEM/README
and pipe it through

  sed -n 's+.*\(/pub/PEM/dist/pem-....../......tar.Z\).*+\1+p'

to get the pathname to pick up TIS/PEM. Of course these instructions are
valid only so long as TIS continues to offer TIS/PEM by ftp in the same
way.

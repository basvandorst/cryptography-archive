There is the theoretical possibility that your "zillion bit trapdoor
encryption scheme" which may or may not be any good on its own may be
accidentially weakened by using it with Clipper!  This isn't very likely,
but you can't be sure until you can analyze both ciphers together.  Which,
of course, the government proposal would not let you do.

There is also the distinct possibility that your "zillion bit trapdoor
encryption scheme" may become a felony offence to use.  Not so today, but
the Washington Post claims someone in the administration would support such
a proposal.

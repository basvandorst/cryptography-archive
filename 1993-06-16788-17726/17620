Announcing the availability of RIPEM 1.1.

RIPEM is a public key encryption program that uses the RSAREF
toolkit, licensed free of charge from RSA Data Security, to
implement a subset of Internet Privacy Enhanced Mail.

Version 1.1 of RIPEM implements Triple-DES, which uses a 112-bit 
key in Encrypt-Decrypt-Encrypt (EDE) mode.  This was added in response to
numerous requests from users seeking an encryption algorithm
that did not suffer from DES's smallish 56-bit keyspace.
Note that EDE is not a recognized DES mode under Internet PEM.

There are a number of lesser modifications in 1.1; see the list
below.

Version 0.8 of Ray Lau's Macintosh implementation of RIPEM 
also includes Triple-DES.

RIPEM can be FTPed from the site ripem.msu.edu, but you need
to apply for an account.  See the document GETTING_ACCESS
at ripem.msu.edu:/pub/crypt.  Both source code and executables
for selected platforms are available.  The source code will
also be available on rsa.com in the near future.

The following lists the changes made between successive releases of
RIPEM.  The most recent version is 1.1.

Changes between 1.0.7 and 1.1:

+++ Enhanced RSAREF to include DES-EDE-CBC as an encryption
algorithm.  This is currently double-key DES: encrypt with key1,
decrypt with key2, encrypt with key1.  This new encryption mode
is specified by including the value 1 in bits 15-8 of the
"algorithm" parameter to certain RSAREF functions.  (Mark Henderson)

+++ Implemented triple-DES in RIPEM.  Added the -A option which
can take values des-cdc and des-ede-cbc.  (Mark Henderson)

+++ Added processor detection and 386 assembly code to double the
speed of the generic MS-DOS version when running on 386 or higher CPU's.
(The 386-specific version is faster, but does not run in the DOS
box of MS Windows, nor with EMM386.)

+++ Updated the RIPEM User's Guide to include a discussion of
the -A option and the previously-implemented ability to have 
multiple public key files.

+++ Included modifications to RSAREF to use the faster GMP
(GNU Multiple Precision) library.  This is not integrated into
RSAREF because of possible conflicts with GMP's GNU license.
See rsaref/test/gmp-hooks-for-rsaref.tar.Z.  (Mark Henderson)

+++ Made static the variable "entry" in GetUserRecordFromServer.
(Rob Spellman)

+++ Made minor revisions to again support the Macintosh Command
Line Interface version.  (Richard Outerbridge)

+++ Ported to MIPS RISC/os.  (Rob Spellman)

+++ Removed the now unnecessary main/ddes.c and ddes.h.
(Suggested by Uri Blumenthal)

+++ Ported RIPEM to Turbo C++ 2.0.  Changed adduser.c, getsys.c,
list.c, and ripemmai.c, and added project files.  (Edgar W. Swank)

+++ Added "version.h" and modified util/man2code to use it.

+++ Modified rsaref makefile to work with AIX/ESA and AIX/386.
(Uri Blumenthal)

+++ Modified RSAREF's rdemo.c to work with additional parameter
selecting mode on certain RSAREF calls.  (Uri Blumenthal)

+++ Added incomplete documentation file ripemfmt.doc, to describe
RIPEM file formats.

+++ Modified server/rkeyserv.c to run under NeXTStep 3.0.
(Louie Mamakos)

+++ Added "repnoh" utility to aid in replying to mail messages
from mailers that include headers in replies.

+++ Changed "generic" entry in rsaref makefile to not include
USE_BIGNUM, which causes problems on SGI machines.  (chk@alias.com)

+++ Changed a #if in bemparse.c to satisfy HP's cc compiler.
(Richard Johnson)

+++ Sped up Perl scripts util/send-ripem and util/display-ripem
by increasing buffer size in subroutine "clobber".  (Louie Mamakos)

+++ Fixed digitas.c and ripemnt.mak to work properly uder Windows NT.

+++ Put NN_2ModExp into RSAREF's nn-386.s, fixing an oversight in 1.0.7.

+++ Ensure that the minimum keysize when generating keys is 512 bits.

+++ Fixed adduser.c so that NRecip, the number of recipients, is
correctly updated.  (This affects only a debug message.)

+++ Allow multiple public key files, either via multiple -p's on
command line, or multiple filenames in the RIPEM_PUBLIC_KEY_FILE
environment variable.  (Suggested by Ron Rivest)

+++ Added RIPEM Beginner's Guide (ripembeg.*) and RIPEM Internet Key 
Server Guide (ripemsrv.*).  (Gary Ratterree)

+++ Added makefile entry for AUX with gcc 2.3.3.  (Phillip Porch)

+++ Removed extra "extern" declaration of usage_msg.

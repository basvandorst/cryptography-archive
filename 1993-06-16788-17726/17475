Could it be you? There is no such thing as an RSAREF license for PGP. There
is only an RSAREF license, the terms for which have been widely published.

A special permission from RSA is required if one is to modify RSAREF's
internals. This is apparently needed for an RSAREF-based version of PGP. Jim
Bidzos of RSA has said he'd grant it if the other conditions in the license
were met.

He is, however, understandably unwilling to grant permissions to those who
violate PKP's patents, and has said this would also apply to the Internet
PEM/Signature products which practice such patents. One of the conditions
for receiving such a license is that the requestor not be in current
violation of PKP's patents. U.S. and Canada only--RSA is not exportable by
PKP, so the situation of foreign "users" is a separate matter.

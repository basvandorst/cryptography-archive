        What I hear being said is that NIU's computer security is so
        sloppy that even the staff in charge of it don't trust it.
        This is very disconcerting when you consider that timesharing
        service bureaus have been functioning for twenty years without
        recorded losses. Has their turn not yet come up, or is it that
        they don't use Unix?

                         Maybe this says it all.
        
        Cheers,

Normally I set stuff like this slide, but I've seen it repeated often
enough...

A certification hierarchy is not "imposed" by RSADSI.  It is suggested
by RFC1422 (which was written by an employee of BBN.)  The "root" is
the Internet Policy Registration Authority (IPRA), under the Internet
Society, which registers PCAs with CAs under them.  You might want to
consider reading the RFC.

That clause no verb.

Under PGP at present, there are no PCA structures; every individual
sets her own policy for what to require before signing a key.  I don't
really see how it could be any other way.

The decentralized web, of course, also has some significant
disadvantages.  I don't consider it suitable for secure business
transactions without prior arrangement, for example, since the
certifiers are just ordinary people and not institutions with deep
pockets.

More serious to the truly paranoid is the fact that whatever bad guys
are trying to violate your privacy, by checking out keyrings they can
get a quick and easy listing of "known cohorts."  Who you've met and
dealt with is not necessarily information you want spread that widely.

Don't get me wrong, I think a decentralized certification system has
some significant advantages.  But it's not all roses.

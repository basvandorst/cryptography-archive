None of which I am aware.

The important aspect of Professor Wiles result is NOT Fermat's Last
Theorem. What is important is the (partial) proof of the Taniyama-Weil-
Shimura conjecture .
 
This conjecture also implies a number of other important conjectures
about elliptic curves.

I can not see that it has any relevence to cryptography.

Please enlighten me. To which problems do you refer? Why does
the Fermat equation having no integer solutions mean that one
cannot reduce the complexity of other problems. What do you also
mean by "this technique"? To which technique do you refer?

   Yes, but not in reasonable time.  The definition I gave was that you could
not differentiate between the pseudorandom sequence and a truly random one
in polynomial time (polynomial in the seed length).  In other words, even
given the whole sequence but one bit, there is no polynomial-time algorithm
to give you a better than 50/50 shot at predicting that bit.  So, a known
plaintext attack would have to fail, as a chosen-plaintext attack would,
assuming our definition holds, and assuming that the seed length is long
enough to make differentiating between this sequence and a really random
one computationally infeasible.

Just because one piece of PEM literature doesn't mention PKP's patents, 
you think the patents have gone away? We've already seen how the PKP 
fan club tried to play down PKP's monopoly by fraudulently summarizing 
RFC 1170 in RFC 1421; why do you think the ``TIS/PEM Certificate 
Administrator's Guide'' should be any different?

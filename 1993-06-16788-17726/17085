The people who claimed the TIS/PEM software is freely distributable
were obviously wrong.  First, TIS claims you have to agree to a
contract to even get the software.  Second, the list of permitted
things to do with TIS/PEM does not include distribution outside one's
own organization and the explanation of the license explicitly says
such redistribution is not allowed.

Although it doesn't appear to have as many limitations as the beta
test version, most of the arguments from my earlier post still stand.
TIS/PEM is not freely distributable, there are many limitations on what
you can do with, TIS and RSADSI probably hold copyright for the code
and don't allow redistribution (so it can't be distributed via
nic.funet.fi even if the software would happen to appear to a site
outside USA), and TIS appears to be using the Internet community to
help making a profit.  And again I'll stress I have no serious problem
with any of this - except perhaps them calling TIS/PEM an "Internet
reference implementation" which is highly misleading - but I don't see
much reason to be enthusiastic about TIS/PEM either.

And I still recommend people to use freely distributable software like
PGP and still hope there will be free PEM implementations available in
the future for those who wish to use PEM.

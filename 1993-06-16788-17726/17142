Nonsense.  All details of the algorithm (except that it is a block
cipher with an 80 bit key) are secret.  If there has been any hard
technical information about the core algorithm I haven't seen it.

That's true for single DES.  It isn't true for multiple DES, or in the
case where DES is used as part of a hybrid public-key cryptosystem,
where a randomly generated key is used for every message.

You're not helping very much.

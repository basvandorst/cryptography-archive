  I don't know of anything specific.  In Jefferson's time, the same level
of cryptography was routinely available to all, military and civilian alike,
and Jefferson certainly didn't seek to make his own invention (the Jefferson
multiple wheels) into some sort of state secret.  Based on those facts, I
would assume that it never occurred to Jefferson that the government might
claim to have any authority to restrict cryptography (other than the obvious
need of government agencies to keep their own crypto keys secret).

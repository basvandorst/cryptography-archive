I believe I posted this a few months ago, so sorry for the repetition, if
you notice.

About eight years ago I paid lawyers lots of $$ to research this very subject.
We were considering making crypto products for the DEC market.

What I was told by a reputable law firm (or at least an expensive one!) was
there are NO CONTROLS on the IMPORT of crypto stuff.  There are LOTS of
controls on the EXPORT but none on the import.

So if we built it here in the US of A, we could only sell it here.  (Makes
sense from a World Trade view, eh?)

We decided off shore production was necessary...  actually, we had a good
way around the export/import laws.  We had a general purpose board which
was a sub-assembly.  We could export it to  a foreign subsidiary.  The foreign
subsidiary could add the crypto stuff and export it back to the US parent
who could then sell it in the US.  Subsidiaries/agents located in other
countries could also get the completed modules from the foreign subsidiary
and sell it in their respective countries.

This requires a country which will not interfere with the export of crypto
gear.  You can't use a NATO country... so go to Switzerland!  (They have an
active crypto export industry... mostly military, but when I looked, they
appeared to be good products.)

We never got beyond the planning stage, but the above business plan should
work.  I hope lots of folks find it useful.

I'm not sure what write-once CD-ROM drives cost; the cost per disk is $40-50.
Unfortunately, while it's useful for data and maybe for key exchange,
it's not very useful for voice encryption, where "useful" involves
economics and convenience.

A typical audio CD gets maybe 1 hour of music, using un-compressed high-res audio; 
data CD's hold about 600 MB of data, which can encrypt 166 hours of 8 kbps voice.
I suppose that's half an hour per day for a year, which should be
adequate for most paranoids, but then you've got to distribute half a
pair of CDs to every paranoid you talk to :-)

This is a big pain - I suppose you could start a business selling
pairs of one-time-pad data CDs, but the FBI would presumably respond
by wanting an escrow copy, or pair of escrow disks.

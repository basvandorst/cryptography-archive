I think this is absolutely correct, not only because the literal
interpretation suggests it, but also philosophically.  The reason
that U.S. citizens are constituationally guaranteed the right to
bear arms is so that the /people/ can defend their freedom against
external as well as internal threats.  Being able to communicate
securely is just as essential to this objective as being able to
kill the enemy.

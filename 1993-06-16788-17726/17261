I know for a fact that military communications don't go by hand-carried 
diplomatic pouch...  Too !@#$%! SLOW.  Why should sensitive diplomatic
messages concerning ongoing negotiations have to wait for a fly-over-some-
ocean time lag (even the Concorde takes over 4 hours round trip, doesn't it?)
when a radio or telephone message is *much* faster.  Besides, a one-time pad
for each of our bases, ships, and strategic weapons systems?!?  Hmph.
They use an encrypted message and authentication codes.  It's not perfect,
but even people with military experience (except high-security radio folks)
don't have the details, and even they can't do anything without the stuff
in the safe- locked- behind a locked door- in a place guarded by people with
guns- and trained Weapons department guards as backups- you get the idea.
Now you see why the Russians had the embassy in Moscow bugged?  It was so
much easier to do than break the encryption of the radio messages.  Bribes
will get you *everywhere*.

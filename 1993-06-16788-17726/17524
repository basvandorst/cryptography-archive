In fact, a similar generator, using a continuous, piecewise linear
function was proposed in some CRYPTO or EUROCRYPT conference.  Adi
Shamir, seemingly with a yawn, wrote a paper on how to break it and
published it *in the same proceedings*!  (That guy seems to have a
real knack for cryptanalysis!)  If you want to check it out, look at
the proceedings from the CRYPTO and EUROCRYPT conferences from 89 to
92, and look in the "Impromptu Talks" section for a contribution by
Shamir. 

Have fun.

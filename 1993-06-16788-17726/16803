Latest is PGP 2.2, it's been out for a while actually.  Try garbo.uwasa.fi,
or oak.oakland.edu, they should have it (probably in something like 
pub/msdos[or pc]/security).  It's already ported to Unix, DOS, Amiga, Mac, NeXT,Acorn Archimedes RISC, and OS/2.  Beware a lot of the Mac versions. I had to get
about 5 of them before I found one that was a valid MacBinary file. For the
Amiga, Archimedes, and Mac version, try various German and UK sites, such as
Demon.co.uk and ftp.uni-freiburg[?].de  Sorry I can't be more specific, but helluse archie, that's what it's for.

For those who have trouble with 2.2 for DOS, there is a "2.21" (just a recomp-
ilation of 2.2 with a minor adjustment in the code to handle some system 
goofiness or other.  Contact me if you need a pointer on where to get it. Note 
that you should only use this "version" if you HAVE to.  Stick with the real
thing otherwise.  For access to possibly the largest collection of UTILITIES forPGP that there is anywhere, including Fido-tech net tools and docs, plus NeXT
patches, and menu/shell programs for PGP for DOS, Unix, and 4DOS, try the BBS
listed in the .sig!  NOTE: as many of you are aware, NitV-BBS received a legal
threat from RSA, so I do not have PGP itself, you'll have to get that elsewhere
if you need it. 

Cheerio,
S.McC.

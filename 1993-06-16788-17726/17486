Summary: Pads don't seem to be subject to export control

In my reading of the ITAR regulations, there is nothing that appears to 
control the export of collections of random numbers.  But it would be an 
export of technical data (and thus subject to licensing) to publish how they 
can be used with OTP software or, at least, how they can be used with 
_specific_ OTP software.

Not only that, but the regulations also subject technical data about such a 
program to export regulations (i.e., the technical data itself is included 
in the Munitions List) and the define the export of technical data as 
publishing it, or talking about it to a non-US citizen or permanent 
resident, within or without the United States.  It is even possible that the 
OTP software is technical data about itself!

I know about these matters because I have written OTP software for MSDOS 
machines that occupies only 114 bytes of code, but is near industrial 
strength.  I have come to the conclusion (i) that I cannot publish the 
source code for this program--which can be loaded into the machine with 
DEBUG--without technically violating the export regulations unless I first
get a license from the State Department and (ii) that the regulations 
that lead to this result are a blatantly unconstitutional violation of my 
First Amendment right of free speach.  I have not yet decided what action to 
take.

That seems to be exactly the way it works.

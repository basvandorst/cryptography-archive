It'll probably have to be moderated though - comp.compression.research is just
going through the process of becoming retroactively moderated (no, not ARMM'd)
because, even though it was meant for research postings, it tended to attract
the usual "Where's the latest Pkzip" and "How do I decompress a .Z file"
postings.

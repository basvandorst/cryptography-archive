It was already known (i) that any counter-example would have to have
n > 1000000 and (ii) a > n^(3n-4) and b > n^(3n-1) / 2.  So any counter-
example would have had to have at least 18 million digits.  I suggest
that the purported disproof belongs to alt.folklore.science (which is
a polite way of saying it never existed).

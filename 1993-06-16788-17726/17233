Let's step back a moment and take a closer look at what the clueless one is
saying here, shall we?

He's saying that if Hitler had been stopped early on, the "holocaust" could
have been avoided.  Fine so far.  But he applies this parable to...who?

That's right--to an innocent and effectively powerless sci.crypt poster who
stated that he was personally going to boycott DD's book to register a
protest against her involvement in the key-escrow developments.  He didn't
even put out a call for a widespread boycott, not that that would have been
so terrible or even successful

The Hitler parable was *not* used as a metaphor for Clipper/key escrow itself,
an analogy that would have been absolutely perfectly appropriate, as hundreds
of more lucid sci.crypt posters have been pointing out for months.

No, never mind that the USG wants all data and correspondence you transmit for
the rest of your life to be readable by them with almost no effort--the real
danger here is someone threatening to boycott a cryptography book.  Yup, let's
stop him now before he gets too big.

Just wanted to make sure that this was clear to everyone.  I will now go back
to studiously ignoring everything this thought-control victim posts.

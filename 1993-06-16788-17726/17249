I posted a one-time pad program to alt.sources a month or so ago.
It's written in C, runs on Unix, simply, boring, and mostly portable.
Jim Gillogly sent me a reply pointing out that some systems
(e.g. DOS) require that files be opened "rb" and "wb" to read and
write binary, instead of simply "r" and "w", which may lead to 
data being munged into some text mode, so change the fopens if your
system does this.

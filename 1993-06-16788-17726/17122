This is a subject of some disagreement. In particular, Clipper is thought by
some to be more secure than current DES (excluding the key escrow feature).

It's not clear what you mean by this. If you mean with a court order getting
the keys--yes. If you mean otherwise--no.

It is not a standard but rather a more secure system than the one currently
used by most people--DES.

This does not follow--see above.

This is the speculation of some, but does not follow as a logical syllogism,
since it has not been demonstrated that the USG intends to standardize only
on Clipper for public use. Nothing in current proposals prohibits
alternatives.

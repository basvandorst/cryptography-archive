        Why? There are a maximum of fifty or a hundred people any
        individual is likely to want to correspond with privately.
        This is a very manageable size of keyfile.

        The "sheer number of keys in existence" is a problem only for
        collectors and, like stamp collectors, these folk will
        undoubtedly invent the appropriate electronic "album" in which
        to keep a great lot of keys.

        If you are initiating a conversation and only want "manilla
        envelope" security, a message requesting their public key, or
        a grep of the news for their name will suffice. If you have
        real secrets, a separate channel is required. There's no
        particular value in a key server for either of these cases,
        except for the mother of all key servers: Usenet.

        Cheers,
                Marc

The new edition of Science News, just out, has a 2.5 page article
on the Clipper/Capstone proposals and the resulting controversy.

Pretty much all sides of the debate are mentioned, and there are
quotes from most of the major players.

It's good to see the subject being aired in more and more places.
Check it out.

Why do you assume that a system we know next-to-nothing about is
cryptographically more secure than a system we know a good deal about?

*** ANALOGY TIME (you have been warned) ***

We have two bags.  One is see-through, the other isn't.  You seem to
be saying, "I'll take the bag I can't see through, because somebody
told me there are cookies in it.  I can see the cookies in the clear
bag, but they may be stale."  This position is patently absurd.  And
we're not even getting into possible motives of the person who told
you about the cookies in the opaque bag.

It's only an analogy, but it seems to hold water to me.

The NSA is now funding research not only in cryptography, but in all areas
of advanced mathematics. If you'd like a circular describing these new
research opportunities, just pick up your phone, call your mother, and
ask for one.

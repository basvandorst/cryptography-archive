     The book ciphers I'm referring to were popular during the
American Revolutionary War.  Take a book which both parties have an
identical copy of.  Encode by replacing each letter in the message
with page/line/letter in the line of a "random" occurance of that
letter in the book.  Usually the word containing the letter was marked
and never used again.

     If a book cipher was used properly, and your opponent did not
have a copy of that particular printing of that book, it is/was almost
as good as the one-time pad.  Much better than anything else available
at the time.  Especially since, at the time there was nothing
particularly noteworthy about an individual who had a (locally) unique
edition of a well-known book such as the bible.

     I think there are still some well known book cipher messages from
that period which have not been decrypted.  Also worthy of note is
that Major Andre', a British spy during the Revolution, used such a
cipher.  I think Kahn's _The_Codebreakers_ has details.

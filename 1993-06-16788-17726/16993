There have been several breakthroughs in factoring since RSA was 
published: the quadratic sieve, for instance, and the elliptic curve 
method, and the number field sieve. The talent responsible for these 
developments isn't exclusively, or even primarily, from the United 
States. John Pollard is from England, for instance, and the Lenstra
family is from Holland. Even if there weren't any social factors working
against the NSA's success in ``quietly hiring a lot of boy mathematical
geniuses fresh out of school,'' the NSA would be at a huge disadvantage
in the factoring business, because _the NSA can't hire John Pollard_.

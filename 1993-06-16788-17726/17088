Unfortunately, between licensing/patent restrictions and everything
else, it is at present fundamentally impossible to generate an
implementation of RSA (PEM or PGP or whatever) which is both freely
distributable (as I understand your definition of the term) and
useable in the U.S. without violating patents.  RIPEM is about the
closest it gets to both; the non-cryptographic portion of the program
is public domain (not just freely redistributable) while RSAREF has a
few restrictions (though the restrictions imposed by the govt are much
stronger than any that RSADSI has.)

There's a genuine tradeoff between "can be used in U.S." and "can be
freely redistributed" to be considered.  Before you reply with the
refrain of "That's your problem, the net is not just in the U.S., blah
blah" note that well over half of Internet *is* in the U.S., at least
for now.  Of course, if PGP had been designed with some kind of
interoperability with PEM in mind, none of this would be much of a
problem.

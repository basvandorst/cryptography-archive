You must have missed the traffic, including a technical summary of Clipper
posted in one of the crypto groups. Enough was revealed about the nature of
the Clipper algorithm to make it clear it was much more secure than DES.
Check with one of the local experts here for details.

As for DES, it's been the consensus of others here that it's now easy to
break by brute force with special-purpose chips well within the budget of
most governments or rich companies. One estimate here was $25 per solution,
and that will doubtless drop over time.

None of the above is from my own knowledge--I'm simply repeating what others
more knowledgeable than I have posted here to help catch you up on the
discussion.

i wrote something proposing splitting up keyfiles along the lines of DNS
here about a month ago. i agree strongly that something like this is
needed.

}PGP implementation to fetch the public key as required.

i think we need to implement real-time key lookups on the internet right
from the outset, if for no other reason than because the thousand or so
current users on the internet would probably just ignore it and keep
thier big keyrings rather than tolerate a 15+ minute roundtrip email
lag. there are also a very large (and rapidly increasing) number of
hosts that are only one or two hops by modem from the internet. thus a
large number of people would have "almost real-time" lookups. it is
certainly feasible, as demonstrated by Sun's "Secure RPC" (implemented with
RSA keys & DES session keys). real-time lookup shoud be the preferred
method, with e-mail lookups required as a fallback strategy.

}Per-user
}public key rings would become unnecessary in this context, apart from
}their possibly greater efficiency of access or to override temporarily
}the global information.

they would still be needed in order to maintain personalized trust
information, and keys for for people who lack e-mail access but still
receive encrypted data by exchanging disks, etc.

the size could be greatly reduced by modifying them to contain (in most
cases) only keyids, userids, and trust info for their trusted or
distrusted users/servers, and get everything else from the servers as
needed.

Please could somebody explain why some people seem to think that PGP
lacks key certificates, or that the PGP model of key certification is a
"problem".  (I thought that it was just David Sternlight, but I see
that Amanda Walker is saying the same kind of things.)

It seems to me that the hierarchical tree of certificates supported by
(some implementations of?) PEM is simply a very restricted special case
of the web of key certificates supported by PGP.

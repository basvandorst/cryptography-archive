A couple of weeks ago, Michelle and Lisa Taylor were acquitted (on appeal) of
the murder of Alison Shaughnessy. This judgment freed them from serving life
imprisonment.

An automatic teller machine transaction (since believed to have been a fraud
or a processing error) placed the sisters near the scene of this murder. The
police did the rest; the appeal court found that they had framed the sisters, 
and in particular had deliberately suppressed a witness statement which
cleared them (this witness had stated that one of the two suspects seen 
leaving the scene of the crime was black, while the Taylors are white). Thus 
Michelle and Lisa were convicted of murder in the lower court.

During the appeal, their counsel did not raise the issue of the bogus ATM 
transaction which caused the trouble, as he was already accusing the police of 
lying about the evidence and did not want to complicate matters by accusing the 
banking industry of lying too.

Nonetheless the story is now out, and it shows that the risk of poor bank
security is not limited to losing the money in your account.

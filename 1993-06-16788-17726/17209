I have just started read about this debate with the clipper chip.  As I see it
The only reason the goverment would try to invlove it self with PUBLIC crypto
is the need for easy evesdropping.  I also see that the secrets of the clipper
chip will be reversed engineered very quickly after the wide spread use, which
in turn will create black market secure copies.  With as much indivudal work
that would go into the cracking of the chip.  the goverment would lose its edge.
The good that would come out of it would be the basic equipment that would incorperate the "clipper" and the ease of changing out the original for the black
market chip.  I my self would want a chip hat has a programable key.

The only business that would support the clipper would be BIG MONOPOLIES.  So lets let them make the equipment and replace the clipper chip with a more secure one.

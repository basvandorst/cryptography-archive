Wow! The great man has spoken with doubts about the Cripple scheme.  I
guess now we can finally feel comfortable believing what those of us
who are able to understand this thing believed all along.

Honestly! Mr. Sternlight.  Do you really think anyone *cares* what
your opinion is for the sole reason that it's *your* opinion (as seems
really strongly suggested by your tone).  You'd do a lot better
actually expressing *arguments* for positions, rather than simply
speaking from your self-perceived position of importance.

Yours, Lulu...

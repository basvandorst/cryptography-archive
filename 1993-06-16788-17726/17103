: And what of the technical objections to DSA/DSS raised in earlier
: documents by officials of RSADSI, such as in the recent CACM?  No doubt
: those objections are now moot.

If RSA Data Security Inc.'s technical objections _are_ now moot as
a consequence of their collaboration with the U.S. government, then
any further research from RSA is certainly flagged as market posturing
rather than necessarily having any truth content.

I surely hope Rivest, Adelman, and Shamir clarify this new coloration to
their academic credentials.

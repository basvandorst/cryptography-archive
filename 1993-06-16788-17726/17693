   Since fecund speculation about clipper runs rampant here, perhaps I may be
   forgiven for adding one of my own--that we will end up even worse off than
   heretofore--namely no clipper AND no secure crypto.  That is--a non-escrowed
   Clipper will be made available to large corporations for internal use in
   their communications centers, with the responsibility for insuring that the
   plaintext is "legal" being left to them, while the rest of us get not only
   no Clipper but also are prohibited from, say, Triple DES, etc.

In case it's not COMPLETELY obvious, it's PRECISELY the latter that we
don't want.  I think it's fair to say that the large majority of people
here believe that there should be no restrictions whatsoever on the use
of cryptography of any form, and any attempt by the government to
mandate, either by law or by market penetration, the use of compromised
crypto is flatly wrong.

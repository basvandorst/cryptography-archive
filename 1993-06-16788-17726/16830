Properly designed ciphers give no hint of "closeness" to a solution,
that is, you can't "converge" on the solution, as in conventional
landscape-learning approaches. (By landscape-learning I mean
hill-climbing approaches, such as simulated annealing, genetic
algorithms, neural nets, etc.)

Like "NP-complete" problems, the correct solution looks like a sharp
spike (Dirac delta function) in an otherwise flat landscape....there
is essentially no landscape to learn. (I'm not saying ciphers *are*
NP-complete, just noting some similarities.)

This is not to say that AI techniques may not be useful. Perhaps they
can post-process the crunching, try to guess passphrases (based on the
user's personal situation), and so on. Probably the NSA has at least
af few folks working on this.

But there's no evidence that DES or RSA can be defeated by turning
loose a "thousand monkeys," even with AI, neural net, genetic
programming, or evolutionary techniques.

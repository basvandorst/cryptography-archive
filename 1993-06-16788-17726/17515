Definitely - and that's especially a problem for things like cellular
phones where you need to be compatible with the Phone Company.

With enduser-to-enduser communication, the problem of compatibility is
also important, and they do want to flood the market to discourage
competition by people with better security, but someone who wants to
compete with them can do so by offering a *better* phone, 
such as one with higher-quality audio or any reasonably-priced video;
the free-market folks have some real advantages here because users of
the various wiretap chips will need to go through government
authorization and design approval processes to be allowed to use them
(since it's easy to avoid key escrow otherwise), while people who don't
have to get permission can work faster.  On the other hand,
I'd guess that approved wiretapped products will probably be exportable,
but products using software encryption can be made overseas and imported,
or made in the US with Flash-EPROM firmware, and export products
shipped to Switzerland or Bulgaria to get written-there-to-US-specs
firmware installed, so the free-market encryption products still do ok.

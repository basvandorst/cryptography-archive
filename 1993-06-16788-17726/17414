Adi Shamir did the famous differential cryptanalysis attack on DES, which
is the strongest known attack to date.  According to his findings, an
attack on 16 rounds of DES is about as much work as searching a key space
of ~53 bits, using a very large amount of plaintext/ciphertext pairs. 
From this information, we can conclude that the key length in DES is not
too small, since it would not enhance the security significantly. 
Presumably, the NSA knew about this attack while DES was designed.

Triple DES uses 3*16=48 rounds, and can therefore be expected to be much
more expensive to break.  Shamir has (as far as I know) no numbers on
this, but the amount of work to break triple DES is probably much more
than searching a 112 bit key space.

Therefore, we can conclude that triple DES is definitely a more secure
cryptosystem than DES.  I would recommend to use triple DES in any
application that is worth more than $1000 per DES block.

Of course, RSA is still the better system!

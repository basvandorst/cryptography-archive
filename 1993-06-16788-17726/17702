Can someone give me a short sketch of the cryptoanalytic techniques
which could be used to break even simple encryptions of compressed
files.  The reason it occurs to me to ask is simply because it is
apparently the nature of compression like Lempel-Ziv to eliminate
recognizable plaintext features like character frequency distributions
and digram, trigram, etc frequencies.  If I understand things
correctly, LZ'd text should be "normal" in the distribution of all
strings (i.e. all sequences equally probably and/or occuring with
equal frequency in infinite strings).  If this is true, how could one
go about breaking a compressed file, even which uses something so
simple as sigle-letter substitution (obviously, exhaustive search
isn't difficult for a "Ceasar cipher" -- but for pretty much anything
harder than this, it's no longer possible.  With something like DES or
IDEA, even a brute-force search of the keyspace would seem 
ineffective, since there's no way to know whether a given key produces 
plaintext or gibberish (since they both have the same stochastic 
properties).  All of this leaves to the side the known plaintext which 
generally occurs in the headers of most encrypted files, but those can 
simply be encrypted seperately or left as plaintext, in order not to 
comprimise the encryption of the compression block.

Yours, Lulu...

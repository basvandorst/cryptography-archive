A negative proof of an assertion means that you cannot use
that assertion as a tool in cryptography (nor in anything else),

A^N+B^N might represent a set of discoverable weak keys of
a crypto system.  If the set of keys were characterizable
as being in C^N then it might derail efforts to characterize
the weak keys of crypto system since A^N+B^N <> C^N, N > 2.

But I am asking blue-sky thots of people from people who know and
don't just need to use (probably faulty) intuition.

Autodidacts need not be defensive about my ignorance --
as Curley says: "I try to think but nothing happens!"

After talking with the people who deal with those requests, I am sure that 
they would be delighted to have an excuse not to grant any licenses--except 
to their friends who probably don't have to wait very long now.  As to who 
those friends are, I don't have the slightest idea, except the suspicion 
that they are members of the military-industrial complex.

There is also the danger that those who have licenses would be just as happy 
if no licenses would be granted to their competitors.  It is not only NSA 
that wants to preserve the status quo by making it hard to export 
crytographic programs.

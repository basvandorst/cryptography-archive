The quadratic sieve algorithm, usable on the large numbers used by RSA,
requires time L(n)^(1 + o(1)), where L(n) = exp (sqrt (ln n ln ln n)).
(That it, the L(n) term is raised to a constant power greater than one).

[_Algorithms_, CLR, pg 852].

I believe I read about a more efficient algorithm recently developed,
but it is still in the same ballpark.

I assume RSA-n refers to a n-digit product.

L(10^120) = 1.307e17
L(10^180) = 5.081e21
L(10^240) = 4.519e25

This assumes an exponent of precisely 1.  Assume the exponent is actually
1.2, just to make things a bit more realistic and normalize by the first
result:

time RSA-120 ~ 3.464e20 -> 1
time RSA-180 ~ 1.115e26 -> 3.218e5
time RSA-240 ~ 6.110e30 -> 1.764e10

Using these figures, RSA-180 would require 4474 years to crack.  Still
rather weak, considering technology and improvements in algorithms. 

This definitely indicates that a 500-bit key is probably too weak.
(Quick calculations: 500 bits = RSA-150, 34.28 years).

RSA-240 would require 245 _million_ years.  This seems rather safe.  :-)

120 digits = 398+ bits.
180 digits ~ 600 bits
240 digits ~ 800 bits

I think you can go as far as 1024 bits in most PK software, which is
quite safe.

Definitely.

It will interwork with other PEM implementations.... At the moment PEM
implementations cannot be exported outside the USA. But this will allow
PEM messages to be exchanged across the border..

I was under the impression that PGP could not be used legally in the USA.

Then we could setup outside the USA a PEM->PGP->PEM relay that could allow
limited inter-working.

If you are happy to break the law then just forget I said this...

Pete.

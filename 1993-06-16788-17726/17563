It would be breakable by known-plaintext attack. The trouble with
pseudo-random number generators is that each number in the sequence is
*uniquely* determined by those that came before. If some of the plaintext is
known, then part of the sequence can be determined. With knowledge (or
guesswork) of the algorithm used to generate the sequence, the rest of the
sequence can be trivially generated and your plaintext recovered.

   I believe that the Truman executive order was declassfied a couple of years 
   ago, in response to a FOIA request by John Gilmore.  I believe he
   then posted it to the net, in sci.crypt.

   Since news that old has long since expired, however :), I could be mistaken.

Another person has sent me mail who has a similar impression, so
perhaps things really have changed at the NSA.  As Bamford says,

    ...in its defense against a 1976 lawsuit seeking access to the
    memorandum, the NSA argued successfully against the release of
    even one word...  Even a congressional committee was forced to
    issue a subpoena in order to obtain a copy of the directive that 
    implemented the memorandum.

So if they're releasing it on an FOIA request (or is it "a FOIA
request"? :-), when they used to refuse it to Congress, there's been
at least some improvement.  (Do you know whether the FOIA request got
the memorandum itself, or the directive that implemented it?)  

I appreciate both of your responses (the mail and the followup
posting).  If anyone happens to know where a copy of the memo or the
directive might be found, I'd appreciate hearing about it.  Thanks!

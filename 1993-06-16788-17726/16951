Even if P = NP the work factor of a cryptosystem
might still be great enough to provide a useful
cipher.

And if the opposite is true, P <> NP, this does not
ensure a cipher does not have (1) implementation faults
or (2) behavior which is *usually* in the realm of P.

I think most researchers believe that P <> NP, though.
(_I_ think so because Godel and Cantor got together to
show that supersets of foo (that is, sets with 2^foo
members) are not enumerable in foo.

It's hard enough to find the bread-crumb path when
they ran out of bread crumbs...

Since the succession of cardinality promises that
we can always invent crypto systems that cannot
even be described in a lower-cardinality system,
we can always stay a step ahead of the cryptanalysts.

But of course the cryptanalysts know this too, so
like applying the integral rather than actually summing
up little rectangles they seek to describe a
cryptosystem in terms of a special case of a higher-
cardinality space -- which may very well have a
'simple' solution.

In other words, Godel was probably a 'full employment'
act for crypto people. Fun!

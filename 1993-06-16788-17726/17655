This might sound rather far fetched, so forgive me.  :)

I'm looking for encryption software for an HP48GX.  Basically, what I'd like
is to spit in encrypted data and read back unencrtpyed data using the serial
port.  Any examples are welcomed, especially those which do what I'm looking
for.  :)

Trivial encryption schemes (xor, etc) are ok, DES would be nice, and IDEA
would be even better.  RSA would be dreaming.  :)

Please reply via mail since encryption is a touchy topic.  ;)

Thanks,
--Michael

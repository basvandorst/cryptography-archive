A mild twit from the twit that started the thread:  "True" is false. It's
a semantic issue introduced by an earlier poster.  A random source is an
"efficient" or "optimal" or "most secure" OTP.  Any data source that is
used only once as a key (or to generate a key), and is not reused, is _in
fact_ a one-time pad (read "true OTP"), regardless of the snotty comments
by an earlier responder.  If it is highly ordered, however, it is
insecure, as has been pointed out by respondents both rude and cultured. 

"Insecure" is of course relative to the degree of secrecy required.  I
don't really care if the NSA knows that I am offering #4500000 for the A
property; all I care is that my competitors Otherguys, Ltd. don't know
till Saturday afternoon.  (In principle I don't want the secret police
listening to _anything_, but that is a different thread.)

Only a couple of responders commented on the original question, regarding
the practicality of using commodity objects to serve as or to generate
keys for one-time-pads, and that was never followed up.

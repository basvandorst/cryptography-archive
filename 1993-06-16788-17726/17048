it was Indiana, and no, that's not what the law said.  The law enumerated
some geometric equations (some of them nonsense) and stated that 
state universities within Indiana were permitted to use such formula
without payment of royalty.  This, and a host of other interesting
topics, are covered in the most excellent book "A History of Pi", bt
Petr Beckman.

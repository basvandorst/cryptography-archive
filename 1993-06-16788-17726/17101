Hmmm... and here I thought a significant part of the idea behind
creating a DSS was to make a standard unencumbered by patents.  I
could see granting PKP royalties until such time as the patents which
it claims cover the DSA expire, but filing a new patent is something
else entirely...

Don't you love sentences that a totally devoid of meaningful content?
Particularly ones that are in the passive voice.  "This was waived
because someone (we don't say who) decided (we don't say why) it was
best."

Note that they say "sublicensing rights", not "exclusive sublicensing
rights" which would be more conventional.  Not sure what, if anything,
this means.

Does this mean RSADSI's technical objections are now just so much
fluff?

Note that patent No. 4,405,829 ("RSA") is not in the above list.
Interesting.  If licensing of DSA et al is to be separate from
licensing of RSA, it becomes in PKP's interest to encourage DSA over
RSA (through pricing and the like) since those patents last longer,
regardless of the technical merits of each method.

It isn't clear here whether that means anybody will be allowed to make
a "Pretty Good Authentication" package for noncommercial use or
whether some kind of "DSAREF" package will be made available by RSADSI
and only it will be licensed.  At least DSA shouldn't be hampered by
export restrictions...

Yup; DSA may be licensed separately and thus can be encouraged over
other mechanisms.

Curious.  I would have expected verifying signatures to be available
more cheaply (or free) to encourage availability.

Perhaps you would like to be a little more explicit?  In particular:

How exactly could Jim Bidzos destroy the entire PEM communications
system?  You don't say.  I am guessing that what you mean is that
RSADSI (or any other TLCA) could start issuing certificates to
imposters who are not who they claim to be.  Please correct me if I'm
wrong.

Under the PEM RFCs, perhaps you would like to discuss how this kind of
action would be handled, what mechanisms exist for revoking the
pertinent certificates, what legal means of recouse exist, and the
like.

While you're at it, you might want to suggest an alternative
mechanism.  I'm guessing you'll suggest PGP's "Web of trust", in which
case I'd be interested in knowing how the system would withstand a
similar action by, say, Phil Zimmermann.  Suppose he started signing
bogus keys, and people generally trusted anything he signed without
question.  Once detected, how would the situation be corrected?  What
legal recourse would exist?

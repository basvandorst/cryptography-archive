	They couldn't avoid it if they ever intend to allow Clipper wiretap
evidence to be used in law enforcement or ever made public. Obviously
if the LEF had been a covert feature of the chip the fruits of wiretaps
could never be made public in court without also disclosing that it
was possible to wiretap Clipper.  Once that came out it would have been
very hard not to disclose at least some aspects of the LEF mechanism,
particularly if the validity of the evidence was challenged in court.

	A covert mechanism, or a weakness in the overt one (LEF) is what
many of us are so afraid of.  If the key escrow access mechanism
proposed by the White House was really the only mechanism used or that
could be used in the (perhaps darker - (Perot fascism ?)) future by all
branches and agencies of government for all Clipper access purposes we
might be less upset about it.  But many of us realize that the current
government has a long history of invading communications privacy to
further what it sees as its essential interests ("national security")
with little or no regard for what an ordinary citizen might feel is a
fair interpretation of the laws on books or the constitution.  And while
most of this has been done by honorable men for honorable purposes (the cold
war was very real once) the possiblity of less honorable men (and it has
happened - witness the Nixon White House) doing so for much less
honorable purposes frightens us.

	There is no question that there are other (worse) glaring holes
in the COMSEC used by most people.  But I remind you that the FBI has
found it necessary to publically press for access to digital
communications systems and for Clipper and that this clearly indicates
that they do not feel that these holes are so universal, so broad and
easily exploited that they don't need to worry.  And most of these holes
can be plugged by taking reasonable precautions available to most
intelligent and informed people, whereas the Clipper hole is unpluggable
if Clipper encryption is mandated and other types of encryption banned
(which "is an option" to todays White House).

	No doubt (See my comments about honorable men).  But this could
change (and such changes have happened in lots of places and times in the
past) and my Clipperphone may not change to keep up, particularly if
such technology is banned and its used made illegal.

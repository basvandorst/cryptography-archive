As long as the file isn't extremely short (some single digit number of
bytes or so) the chances of being able to produce a second plaintext
from an enccrypted file by decrypting it with a different key are rather
insignificant.  If you look at the unicity distance of the plaintext
when using a 56 bit key, you'll see why this is so.

(See any good information theory book for a discussion of unicity
distance and the like)

   How about a moderated group (or even a mail-list)?

Moderated: yes please.  (If a good moderator can be found)
Mail list:  Definitely not.


   Sometimes I enjoy the political talk (and sometimes I participate) but I
   can certainly sympathize with people who don't have time for it.

   I think splitting the groups is a good idea.


I personally would like to see a sci.crypt.puzzles or its equivalent.
It would be for posting challenges, analyses and solutions.  Further
specifications, such as moderation status, acceptability of classes of
postings, etc, is open to discussion.

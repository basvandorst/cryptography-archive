I believe those motives are secondary to the government's primary
motive, which is to ease the tasks of law enforcement and preserving
national security at the expense of introducing the potential for
unlawful intrusion by the goverment into the privacy of its citzens.

I believe that most of the goverment actually believes that it would
not abuse that potential.  They are fooling themselves, because there
are always those in goverment who will abuse such power.

This may be true but what's wrong with trying to understand where all this
is leading to?  It is patently clear that Clipper will work as intended
only assuming all other crypto schemes are made illegal.  If, say,
triple DES remains legal, Clipper will die the natural death on the market
because of international compatibility problems (not to mention potential 
foreign law violations).

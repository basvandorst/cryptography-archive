	Er, Mark?  Clipper was announced to us as a "Classified" algorithm
already on a chip, courtesy of the good folks at the NSA and Mykotronx of
Torrence California.  The document we'd like to see is at the bottom of the
locked filing cabinet.  But the purpose?  It is to give law enforcement much
wiretap capacity, while you encrypt to your hearts content, the FBI or friendly
law enforcement agency will be decrypting.

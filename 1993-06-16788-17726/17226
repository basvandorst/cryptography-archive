In some very interesting messages, it has been suggested that shorter RSA
keys are likely easily crackable with a Connection Machine, but 1024 bit
keys are probably still safe.

Are 1024 bit RSA keys practical for real-time speech? No cheating--i.e.
vocoders that sound artificial, etc. Could AT&T market 1024 bit RSA phones
as easily and cheaply as Clipper (assuming the $25 per Clipper chip reported
earlier)? Would they sound "normal"? (I'm thinking of widespread use, not
"special" high-security phones where people might be willing to put up with
lowered quality.)

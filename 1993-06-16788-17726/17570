Actually, both the U.S. and Canada have prosecuted individuals and
companies for violations of export control laws, of which ITAR is but
one set.  One fellow, whose name escapes me at the moment, dealt with
our firm -- buying very high resolution film recorders and selling them
to people he had promised us he wouldn't.  Or so the allegation went.

The case was an embarrasment for the Attorney General of the State of
California.  Seems there was an extradition hearing to "export" said
individual to the U.S., and part of the evidence was an affadavit signed
by the AG claiming to have read and authorized a 2nd, police affadavit
the day before the 2nd affadavit was completed.  Couldn't read a
calendar, or something.  Anyway, the fellow was extradited to the U.S.
Don't recall if he ever got convicted.

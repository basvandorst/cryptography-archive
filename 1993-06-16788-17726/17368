My belief is that if I use Norton's DISKREET (Norton Utilities 5.0)
in DES mode, use at least 8 bytes of key, and keep that key safe, that
any data I protect this way and/or send over the internet will be
safe from anything  but the most determined (and well financed) attack.
Since it is unlikely that the NSA cares anything about what I'm doing
(they'll find themselves awfully bored otherwise), I've likely got
complete security.

Am I right, or wrong here?

Thanks!

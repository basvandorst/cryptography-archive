   Does any body knows if license is required for the commersial use of
   DES and RSA algorithms ?

It depends.  If you write your own DES or RSA code, no licensing is
needed in the UK.  If you use other people's code, you have to follow
their rules.  Some implementations are under GNU Copyleft.

   Also is there any export control restrictions for the use of those
   algorithms outside the USA ?


Again, it depends.  Your mail address is clearly outside the US.  The UK
authorities might be able to stop you from exporting your code outside
the EC, but I suspect they'd have a hard job preventing transmission
within the EC.  However, if you want a legal opinion, consult a lawyer.
What you got from me is worth at least as much as you paid me for it.

If, however, you mean "Do the US export control restrictions affect my
use of the encryption?", the answer is "No, not directly".  They might
give you hassles should you export something to the US and then want to
bring it back again.

I am helping a company to connect their offices which are in different
cities of the US. I was asked to investigate the possibility of having
secure communication over the leased lines we are getting to connect
their computer systems.

I am interested in finding out a rather less complicated solution to this
yet it should be reasonably secure. So, my question is, are there such
companies that manufacture hardware or software solutions for this problem?
Such as a device that we can stick into our PC and do encryption/decryption
in real-time. Or a software that we can run on our documents before we
transmit them?

Any information will be greatly appreciated..

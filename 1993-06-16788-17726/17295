I would think that using a CD would also leave you wide open to a known
plaintext attack.  Then there's the problem that commercial CDs are *not*
the same across the world (or even pressings). For example, I've heard at
least three different versions of New Order's "Brotherhood". Two were
from the UK (but were different pressings) and one from the USA.

However, I think that the brute-force approach is becoming increasingly
infeasible -- there are thousands of commercial CDs released across the
world every month (in the music industry alone)! Perhaps the NSA will become
the best CD library in the world :-)

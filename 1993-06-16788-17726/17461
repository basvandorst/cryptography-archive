The main weakness of this algorithm is that it is NOT non-repeating -  
the run-length of the generated pseudo-random sequence is limited, partly due 
to rounding errors in the floating point arithmetic.

There is a detailed discussion and analysis in Cryptologia XV #2: 
"Supercomputer Investigations of a Chaotic Encryptor Algorithm" by
Daniel Wheeler and Robert Matthews, along with a follow-up Letter to the
Editor in volume XVI #2 "Chaos and Random Numbers" by Ross Anderson.

There is also a related patent (unfortunately I don't have the patent #, but
I believe it was issued in 1991) that describes a more convoluted use
of the Logistic Equation for encryption.  Unfortunately, it suffers
from even worse pseudo-random sequence run-length limitations.

However, you shouldn't feel discouraged about pursuing chaotic functions
as a source of pseudo-random one-time pads.  There is a very simple approach
which uses multiple-parameter pseudo-random functions (including, but not
limited to, chaotic functions) to generate arbitrarily many (> 10**40)
one-time sequences that seem to satisfy the cryptographic requirements
of unpredictability and pseudo-randomness.  The technique seems to be
applicable to both substitution and transposition ciphers and also seems to
solve the problems of global key management and global synchronization
of one-time pads.

So far it has passed the basic test of robustness of being evaluated by
the NSA and being _strongly_ (almost vehemently) rejected for export
approval.  (although there is a modification that would permit an exportable
version).  Obviously, this technique / methodology requires extensive
and detailed analysis by other, non-NSA cryptographic experts before
one can assert that it is truly robust. 

The method that you propose  (ie, the Logistic Equation) is more robust
cryptographically when use to drive a pseudo-random transposition cipher
than when driving a substitution cipher simply because transposition
ciphers are much harder to cryptanalyze  (ref. "The Use of Genetic 
Algorithms in Cryptanalysis" by Robert Matthews, Cryptologia Vol. XVII
# 2, April 1993).

Posting put us above most amateurs.

The idea I posted would be very weak if used the way I suggested as
one known clear text block would allow you to get all clear text from
the cipher text. I am working on strengthening it though; you can
expect to get an implementation in C soon.

I think strong conventional crypto should be easy to do in software.

Most of the common crypo systems like DES and IDEA are not optimized
for modern computers, rather they can be implemented in a small amount
of dedicated silicon. It might cost more than 1000 times more to do DES
on a general purpose computer than on a dedicated machine. This would
correspond to 10 key bits for a brute force known plaintext attack.

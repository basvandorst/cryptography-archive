I think DH has the definite advantage for key exchange, assuming you
have an interactive channel. If you merely encrypt a key with your
correspondent's RSA public key and send it, you are vulnerable to
subsequent attack if the secret key matching that public key is ever
compromised.

But if you use DH to generate a key, once you destroy it after use
there is no way to ever recover that key, or the data encrypted with
it. And you can still use RSA to *sign* the DH exchange (to protect
against the man-in-the-middle attack) without risk even if the RSA
secret keys used to sign the exchange are later revealed. The rule
is to use RSA only for signing, not for encryption.

The NSA's STU-III secure telephone *has* to work along the lines that
I've just described. There's a rule with the STU-III that says the
phone is classified only when the crypto ignition key is inserted and
turned; once the key is removed, the phone becomes unclassified again.
Since there is still semi-permanent keying information (presumably RSA
or DSS secret keys) in the phone and the CIK after the CIK is removed,
the protocols must make it impossible to recover a session key even
with this information -- otherwise the phone could never become
unclassified again without totally zeroizing it.

	   As I've mentioned earlier, the biggest problem I see with the
   OTP is that the key is [I don't know the technical term] NON-memorizable.
   Suppose I have a 1Mb data file encrypted with a OTP. There's no way I
   can possibly memorize the 1Mb key/pad for my data - I have to keep it
   someplace. That means that if I lose it, I am hosed because my data *is*
   unrecoverable. That means that if I'm cavity searched and they find that
   8mm tape where I hid it (ouch!) then the data is compromised. Memorizable
   keys (IDEA keys, DES keys, etc) have the advantage that you don't *HAVE*
   to keep the key written down. I suppose if it merits it, you can dispose
   of the key quickly with a .357 magnum.


What you are saying is yet another version of:

	OTP's are superb for *communicating* secret information between
	physically secure sites. The pad *must* be truly one-time, that
	is, it must be destroyed after use to prevent reuse by an enemy.

	OTP's are not particularly good for *storing* information.

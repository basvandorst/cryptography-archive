D. Knuth has a discussion of random sequences in his
"Seminumerical Algorithms".
One of the  definitions he discusses is the following:

Definition R6 in the section "What is a random sequence?"

A b-ary sequence <X_n> is said to be "random" if, for every
effective algorithm that specifies an infinite sequence of distinct
nonnegative integers <s_n> as a function of n and the values of
X_s_0, ... X_s_{n-1}, the subsequence <X_s_n> corresponding
to this algorithm is "random" in the sense of Definition R5.

A [0,1) sequence <U_n> is said to be "random" if the b-ary sequence
<[bU_n]> is "random" for all integers b \ge 2.


Definition R5 states that
A b-ary sequence is said to be "random" if every infinite
subsequence defined by a computable subsequence rule is 1-distributed.


"1-distributed" means that Prob(u \le U_n < v) = v - u for
all real numbers u,v with 0 \le u < v \le 1.

The remaining undefined terms in these quotations are quite exactly defined in
Knuth's work or elsewhere.

Even Definition R5 is quite a good definition, however Knuth raises an
objection it; hence definition R6.


DK adds "The author contends that this definition surely meets all
reasonable requirements for randomness, so it provides an answer to the
principal question posed in this section."  
He has a footnote which says that at least he did in 1966.

I believe it's a fairly good definition in that it doesn't
use any non-elementary concepts.  It uses the concept of
effective computability; hence it may prove
to be slightly impractictical for deciding whether something
exhibits random behaviour.  In that sense it's not a very good definition.

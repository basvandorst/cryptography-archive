This really is silly.  Any well compressed data has entropy almost
equivalent to random data- ie it's almost impossible to distinguish it
from encrypted data.  Is the Clipper spec going to say that it will
fail for entropies above x?  So if you attempt to send a JPEG file it
will fail?

Voice requires 4800 baud.  Any RSA chip can do that.

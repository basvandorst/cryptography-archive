   From my reading of both models, the PGP model is less extensive but more 
   flexible in some ways.  I prefer the PEM model simply because it seems to 
   automate more of the certificate-handling process.

What do you mean by "certificate-handling process"???? Please define
this term.

   Now, it is tautological that given any digital signature algorithm, you can 
   construct certificates.  You could use a "web of trust" with PEM just as 
   easily as with PGP.

No, this is not true, since the PEM certificates specifically state
who can sign whose certificate, and you can only have a single
signature on your certificate, whereas PGP allows you to have any
number of signatures on your certificate.  Granted, there are some
problems with the PGP model, (one which could be very problematical,
as someone pointed out to me recently), however it is much more
flexible, as you mentioned, and the certificate hierarcy is a subset
thereof.

Theoretically, you could place the PEM certification hierarchy within
the PGP trust model, but the reverse is not true.  With PEM, you are
locked into your name and site on your certificate.

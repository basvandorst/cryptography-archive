Does anyone know exactly what the status of the Clipper "interagency 
review" is? The CSSPAB and a zillion others have forcefully asked that it 
be extended (considerably?) to make sure of a thorough review. The only 
comment I've run across that indicates those pleas might have been heard
is 
the following that showed up in conjunction with reporting on the CPSR
June 
7 conference: 

       "At the Third CPSR Cryptography and Privacy Conference on
Monday, June 7, the Acting Director of NIST, Raymond Kammer, announced
that the implementation of the proposal will be delayed and that a more
comprehensive review will be undertaken. The review is due in the fall.
Kammer told the Washington Post that 'maybe we won!t continue in the
direction we started out.'"

Does anyone know for sure whether a) the deadline for the review has been 
extended (to when?) and b) whether Kammer or anyone else has amplified on 
the statement quoted from the Wash. Post?

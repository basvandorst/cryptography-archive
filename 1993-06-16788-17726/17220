On my personal experience so far with diplomatic communication.  I admit that 
this is limited, and I have been informed in response to my article that most 
routine traffic is indeed conducted using conventional military encryption 
(such as the KG series of encyptors).

Is it?  Only if your pad is a WWII-style piece of paper that is used by hand.

At a guess, because OTPs are in wide use, and depend solely on physical 
security.  In cases where that security can be maintained, this is an 
advantage.

Not at all.  None of my knowledge of cryptographic theory and practice has 
been obtained from "the local store," at least after the age of 14.  On the 
theory side, most of it stems from my study of discrete mathematics and 
information theory (which I don't post about); on the practice side, most of 
it derives from personal discussions with people in the aerospace, 
intelligence, and data communications industries (which I occasionally use as 
a basis for posting).

Not at all.  Mere aptitude and a good academic history are, rather, quite 
*insufficient* to providing an adequate background in the theory and 
application of cryptography.

  New electronic cash system: report available by FTP.
  ---------------------------------------------------

Electronic cash is the equivalent of paper cash in an electronic form.
It has all the same basic properties as ordinary cash: It carries
value, can be used to pay other people without contacting any central
organization and is completely anonymous.

Recent work at the CWI has resulted in significantly improved
protocols for electronic cash. The following CWI technical report is
now available by FTP:

Title:    Single Term Off-Line Coins
Author:   Niels Ferguson
Report:   CS-R9318
Site:     ftp.cwi.nl
directory:/pub/CWIreports/AA
file:     CS-R9318.ps.Z (compressed PostScript file)


                             Abstract
                             --------
  We present a new construction for off-line electronic coins that is
  both far more efficient and much simpler than previous systems.
  Instead of using many terms, each for a single bit of the
  challenge, our system uses a single term for a large number of
  possible challenges. The withdrawal protocol does not use a
  cut-and-choose methodology as with earlier systems, but uses a
  direct construction.


This report is slightly more extensive than the version that appeared
in the pre-proceedings of EuroCrypt '93.

If you are interested in this report, you might also be interested in
a report by my colleague Stefan Brands entitled "An Efficient Off-line
Electronic Cash System based on the Representation Problem". It can be
found under the name "CS-R9323.ps.Z" in the same directory.

Note: Followup set to sci.crypt

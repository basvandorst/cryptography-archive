   Years ago I put together a little simple algorithm for encrypting DOS
files, and I've been using it ever since.  I've been wondering ever since
how one might go about attacking it, especially knowing the algorithm.
   I'm no expert, but no novice either, at cryptanalysis; it's a hobby since
I was ten (42 now).  Been all through Helen Gaines' book, etc.  But I have
found NO sources of info on computer encryption at all, which is apparently
another whole ball game, so in that respect I'm a total tyro.
   Also, just out of curiosity, can anyone point out the weaknesses (there
MUST be some) in the following algorithm...?

1.  Get a key (7 to 128 characters, anything but ^X, ^?, ^H and ^M legal).
2.  Seed the random number generator from certain characters in the key.
     (Random number generator is "borrowed" and stands up to my meager
      tests as being VERY random.  64-bit number generated; I use the
      low-order 16 bits.)
3.  For each character in the file being encrypted:
	A.  XOR the character with the low 8 bits of the random number.
	B.  Compute (same-random-number modulo keylength); use that
	     as an index into the key, take that key character and XOR
	     the result of (A) with it.

   This has the effect of generating an "infinite-length" key (I think).
   It seems to generate relatively random output; I encrypted a file of
100,000 "a's" with a key of ten "a's" (61H) and looked for duplicated
strings; maximum length of any repeated string was 3.  (Of course, that
means the key was kinda out of the picture and only the random number
generator was being tested.)

   Any good books readily available on the subject of computer encryption?
I have virtually no access to journals.

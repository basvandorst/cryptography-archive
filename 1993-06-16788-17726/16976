A valid point; I agree. The key server should provide several ways to
actively zeroize all secret key information. These might include:

1. A user configurable interval has elapsed since the user typed his
passphrase to decrypt the secret key.

2. The user strikes a "panic" key or keys (e.g., both shift keys
simultaneously, as in Norton's DISKREET).

3. A user-configurable number of secret key operations have been
performed.

4. The serial connection between the palmtop and the host is cut. It
may not be practical to continuously exchange keep-alive messages
across this link, much less full-blown crypto challenges (considering
the non-multitasking nature of the machines likely to be on both ends)
but one could at least look for certain modem control lines to be
asserted. This would detect the common case of simply disconnecting
the cable.

In each case, the key server program would immediately overwrite all
plaintext copies of the user's secret key and prompt him again for his
passphrase.

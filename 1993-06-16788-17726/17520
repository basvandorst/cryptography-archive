Here is a shortened version of my 6/23 letter.  I sent this one to Science
News today for their letters column, since I doubt they'd publish anything
as long as the original letter.

------------------

In your article on the encryption policy controversy (SN: 6/19/93, p.394),
Lance Hoffman is quoted, repeating a popular misconception: "For the first
time in history, we have a situation in which individuals can use
cryptography good enough that even governments can't read [the encrypted
messages]."

Various authors, from Alberti (b.1404) through Porta (b. 1535) published
polyalphabetic cryptosystems for which the first recorded method of attack,
by a government cryptanalyst, is dated 1863. In or before 1920, Vernam (of
AT&T and later IT&T) published the first provably unbreakable cryptosystem.

In the 4000 year history of cryptography (c.f., David Kahn,"The
Codebreakers") it is the rule rather than the exception that strong
cryptosystems have been invented and first used in the private sector,
where I call a system "strong" if it is as strong as the strongest used by
the diplomatic or military services of the time.

If this is true, then we refute the basic assumption upon which the
form of government in the U. S. is based. If educated people aren't
essentially competent to address such issues, then they aren't
competent to judge the capabilities of legislators and senior
government executives (governors, presidents, etc), and thus
shouldn't be trusted to vote on choosing them.

Personally, I think issues of public policy (domestic and foreign) in
general deserve public discussion. There are very, very few cases
where it's appropriate for big issues to be resolved by unilateral
decisions of "experts."

Key escrow has some interesting parallels with the safety policy
issues of nuclear power.  Both depend on proper application of
procedural and technological controls by people in specialized
organizations over a long period of time. It's not a foolproof
situation.

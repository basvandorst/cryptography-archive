Perhaps Noriega and the Achille Lauro terrorists - among others - could
elaborate on this statement.  The United States government has taken a
position, supported by the Supreme Court, slightly contrary to the one
you offer.

Essentially the position is if (1) it's illegal in the US and (2) you do it
and (3) it has an effect in the US or affects a US national then (4) you
can be prosecuted in the US, absense of extradition treaties notwithstanding.
Point (3) can be waived if you are a sufficient annoyance.

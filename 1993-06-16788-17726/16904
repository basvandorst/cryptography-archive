Commercial and shareware encryptors are notoriously poorly done;
the few that were done well (for example, Stuffit with NewDE version
of DES) are often changed -- for the worse.  Stuffit 3.0 and above
quietly will _decrypt_ the old, more secure NewDE but only _encrypt_
under a much weaker algorithm (a short-key XOR I'm told).

The only programs to trust come in source: PGP is the best of the lot.

PGP also does a ZIP-like compression, too.

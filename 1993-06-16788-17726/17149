This is most certainly not a dumb question, and has been seriously
proposed and stoutly defended in email correspondance.

   a key is not much different from an IP address.  So PGP keys could be
   distributed by creating a new class and storing them in the existing name
   server databases.

The mechanism already exists in the DNS.

   One difference: a different means of inserting a key into the database would
   have to be found.

That is the $64k problem.  How does jruser insert a key in the DNS
without superuser privilege?  What happens if the site management
refuses to support PGP keys at that site?  Can another, friendlier site
step in?  If so, how?

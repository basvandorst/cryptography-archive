Not being a US/Canada citizen, if I have software that does encryption
and email it to another person also not in US/Canada and it happens to
get routed via an email relay in the US, are the export laws being broken
in the US?

Unless you are actually using PEM or PGP to send email, can they legally
prove that you are the one who sent email? Can it stand up in court even if
you ARE using PEM or PGP.

Are the export restriction laws more like speed limits that most people 
ignore at various times or like murder laws that most people feel should
be obeyed?

Pete.
P.S. Can someone using RIPEM send me a CRL?

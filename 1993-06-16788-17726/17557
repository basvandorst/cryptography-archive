Since the recent alleged Wile's proof of Fermat's Last
Conjecture deals with principally in abstract algebra
(the elliptic curves and Galois groups, etc.) we've
known to love in modern day crypto, are there any uses
for this work or implications to crypto obvious to the
mathematicians out there?

It would seem to be a *positive* result in the sense that
to have no integer solutions to these kind of equations means
that this technique cannot be used to *reduce* the complexity
of certain related crypto problems and thus be able to break them --
i.e., the encryptors are still ahead of the decryptors.

Any other blue-sky implications?

Why make it so difficult? A few paragraphs later, you indicate a much 
simpler way to achieve the same result:

If some Three-Letter Agency gained physical access to your clipperphone, 
they could as well replace the clipper chip by another one whose unit key 
they know already. This could be one from a confiscated phone where the 
escrow agencies produced the keys on a legitimate request (with warrants 
etc.), or a sample from a special production run whose keys have never 
made it to the escrow agencies. 

Since the individual key and serial number of the chip don't seem to be 
involved in the actual encryption, you won't notice that the chip has 
been exchanged.

Wouldn't this be much easier than implementing a secret way to read out 
the key? I shouldn't be surprised if all clipper chips had to be mounted 
in sockets by governmental order ...

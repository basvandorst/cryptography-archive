	Real easy.

	Don't use DNS. Use something just *LIKE* DNS but on a different
port. Start out with the named code that's already out there but allow
updates if they are PGP signed by someone the nameserver trusts. Permit
"nameservers" that trust eachother to do *signed* "zone transfers",
etc, etc.

	The reason not to use the DNS is because it only works well
if you're on the Internet. Using a service that is parallel to the
DNS [and which may share code] means you can "break" certain things
you wouldn't want to "break" in the real DNS - such as adding a
new top-level "domain" or a fake domain for the folks who are
trapped on BITNET.

	*Opinion: It's not necessary to overload certification management
into some existing structure. Yes, they are similar activities, and have
similar problems. This does NOT mean that the two problems should be
conflated. Certainly the similarity of the problems is to our advantage
since it leaves code that can very easily be adapted.

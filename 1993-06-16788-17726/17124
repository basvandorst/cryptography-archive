Just to throw another issue on the discussion, have people noted that RSA's
terms for free use of their digital signature patents, and the one licensed
to them from the USG, include the condition that the licensee not currently
be infringing any of RSA's patents.

That does not bode well for U.S. users of PGP, particularly those who have
flaunted such use in public.

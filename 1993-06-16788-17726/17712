Not true of the UK; it is possible to get a UK patent on an algorithm
if it has what is known as "techincal effect".  There's a NCC
publication which (rather confusingly) explains this.

That's true of the RSA patent.  Is it true of Diffie-Hellman?

US patents last 17 years from the date when they were granted.  As
far as I know, the Diffie-Hellman patent is still valid.  The RSA
patent was granted in 1982 even though RSA was described in print in
1977.

The work of Diffie and Hellman _was_ public key encryption in
general.  Now clearly such a broad patent is silly; that doesn't
mean, unfortunately, that it's not legally enforceable.

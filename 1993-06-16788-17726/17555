Hi, 
there are no dumb questions - only dumb answers....so never fear to ask.
As far as I know the Unix crypt uses a modified version of the Enigma code
used in WW2. The original version had a flaw, which made it possible, that
the code could be cracked by the Brits in only some years and not some
iceages. But the code now used is fairly safe. The brute force method of
sending everything from aaaaa to zzzzzzzz (not to mention ctrl chars)
would take forever. I wrote a program for my 486 66Mhz that checks 3000
words per second. A password with 5 letters (aaaaa-zzzzz) would
take (26^5)/(3000*60*60) =1.1 hours. From there it becomes more and more 
timeconsuming. If you use lower and uppercase chars it would take 1.5 days.
So everything depends on the stupidity of the human who chooses the password....
and that you get hold of the passwd file.
Bye.

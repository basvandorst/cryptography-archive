No, that's not good enough. STU-IIIs can communicate without having to
go through a key management center each time; this strongly implies
the use of public key cryptography. Furthermore, all of the crypto
keys for a STU-III are stored in hardware (either the CIK or the phone
itself); the user doesn't have to memorize anything. That means the
phone must have (or be able to re-create) all of whatever
semi-permanent secret keying information is needed each time it places
a new call. (At the very least this must include a secret key used for
authentication, since each phone displays the other user's
identification.)

However, the STU-III must NOT be capable of re-creating from this
semi-permanent secret information the session key for any prior calls;
otherwise the phone could never become unclassified once it had made a
call without being completely zeroized (which would render it useless
for future calls). Presumably this would have to be true even if a
prior call had been completely recorded, and even if an attacker with
knowledge of the protocols (but not the secret key information) had
been able to place himself in the middle.

The only algorithm I know of that meets all of these criteria is this
authenticated DH key exchange. I think Whit Diffie calls this scheme
"perfect forward secrecy" because of its ability to prevent a recorded
call from ever being deciphered once the session key used to encrypt it
has been destroyed, even if the semi-permanent keys used to authenticate
it are later seized.

By the way, this particular scheme could render completely moot the
arguments about whether a criminal suspect could be forced to divulge
an encryption key, at least as far as two-way communications are
concerned.  There would be nothing he could divulge except the secret
RSA/DSS key he used to sign his DH exchanges, and this would be
useless for decrypting prior recorded conversations. (The police
*could* use it to impersonate him in future calls, unless the suspect
is able to get the word out that his key has been compromised.)

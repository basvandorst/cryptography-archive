Silly question - since a OTP will generally be used only between two
parties, is is feasible for the parties to agree (in a secure manner) to
use two copies of some commercial audio or data CD?  Presumably they are
identical (within manufacturing tolerances). 

Could they, for instance, use "the fourth band of the Von Superbo
performance of Beethoven's Ninth by Overpriced Records, catalog number
CD-12345" ?  This assumes some simple method of reading an audio CD
bitwise (or at least bytewise) in a consumer computer. 

Alternatively, use a common and mutually-agreeable data CD, e.g. "the DAK
discount CIA Fact Book, 1984" or such ?

Certainly cheaper than unit production of OTPs, and for music, has the
advantage of entertainment while it hides in plain sight, like the OTP
books of spy novels.  

Think of the NSA machine built to counter it - a million-hole CD changer
... boggles the mind...

The whole idea of any outside entity having access to a secure key is anathema
to us over
here.

    The UK govt. could try something like clipper and we would boycott it,
expose their motives and ultimately depose them by the same methods they depose
their predecessors.


    This country may not have a 'Bill of Rights' etc., but it has people
who HATE being dictated to, and whose normal reaction to any
infringements of their freedom is take action - very loudly!

    The idea of your NSA having legal access to cipher keys is sick!
You'd think the USA would have learned its lesson after MacArthy huh? I guess
people have short
memories....

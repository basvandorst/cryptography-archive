I assume that:

(1) Clipper is not significantly more secure than other crypto-systems now
available.  In other words, security considerations will not lead people to
choose Clipper in preference to, say, RSA.

(2) Clipper provides a secure cryptographic standard that can be legally
eavesdropped.

Given the above assumptions, what could be the purpose of Clipper?  If it is
solely to provide a cryptographic standard to the public, then the Skipjack
algorithm could be provided by itself; the keys could be supplied in some
tamper-resistant package along with each chip.

So the provision of a cryptographic standard cannot be the sole purpose of
Clipper.  Its ability of being legally eavesdropped must be the main
motivating factor.  But by the first assumption, people will not adopt Clipper
by choice if they only want secure communications, negating the ability to
legally eavesdrop their communications.

The conclusion: people must be forced to adopt Clipper.  Hence Clipper must be
the opening step in a legislative program that would eventually restrict
public access to crypto-systems.

I know that nothing in the above argument is really new, but I hadn't seen it
succinctly followed out to the conclusion I reached.  Can either my
assumptions, or the steps in my argument, be refuted?

I'm wondering if anyone out there can point me towards the
specifications of IDEA?  I would prefer the location of an
FTP site which has both a functional definition and source,
but even a reference to a published article would be appriciated.
Please respond via e-mail, and thanks in advance.

P.S. Count me in for a yes vote for sci.crypt.tech (moderated)

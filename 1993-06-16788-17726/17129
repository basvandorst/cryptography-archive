(I expect even professional patent attorneys would have some
disagreement about exactly what each of the patents covers...)

Most of them were mentioned in the root article for this thread.  The
patent I believe you mean is #4,405,829, Cryptographic Communications
System and Method ("RSA").  It was granted in 1983, I don't recall the
exact date offhand.  If I recall correctly, the patent which PKP
claimed the DSA infringed was either Diffie-Hellman or Hellman-Merkle,
probably the former, but I'm sure someone else can answer more
authoritatively than I.

Patriotism is, in fact, the *first* refuge of the scoundrel.

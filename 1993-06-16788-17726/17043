This is going to sound like a dumb question, but why not simply extent the
existing name server system to include provision for public keys?  In my mind,
a key is not much different from an IP address.  So PGP keys could be
distributed by creating a new class and storing them in the existing name
server databases.

One difference: a different means of inserting a key into the database would
have to be found.

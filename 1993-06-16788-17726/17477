I've put together three common hash functions---Snefru-8, MD5, and
CRC-32---into a small package. The highlight of the package is my
fingerprint program, which reads a file and prints a readable 76-byte
word containing all three hashes. There are helper utilities to convert 
the word into formats compatible with the snefru, mddriver (or md5sum),
and POSIX cksum programs. There's also a uniform set of libraries which
you can use to calculate hashes in your own programs.

The package is easy to set up: you just unpack and make and that's it.
I've probably assumed UNIX and 32-bit ints somewhere, but maybe not.
Certainly long ints have to be 32 bits.

If you're willing to look at the package and give me some constructive 
criticism, let me know and I'll send it to you. The shar file is 99K.

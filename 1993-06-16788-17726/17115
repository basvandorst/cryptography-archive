A secure cryptographic standard, to protect you from foreign governments,

How do you see 'Skipjack by itself' being supplied?

Nop argument here.

What do you mean 'people'?  A number of people have openly said that they
feel Clipper is 'secure enough', protecting them from eavesdroppers with
a system developed by cryptographic experts.

I can't see this.  The US government certainly seems to keen to ensure
that Clipper is available and working, hoping it will be a de facto
standard, but I see no indication of the coercion you imply.

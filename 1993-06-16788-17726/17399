True, but look at the subject line - it says `*impending* PGP key
distribution logjam'.  We're on the knee of the curve where we can see
that problems will arise using existing systems.  One such problem is
that at the moment most sites don't have many users interested in a.s.k -
this will change as PGP becomes more popular, hence a.s.k may well figure
in the solution to the logjam.

True of any alt group, but most sites include or exclude the alt heirarchy
in toto.  Of the few that don't I would expect that any site making a
deliberate choice to receive a.s.pgp would also choose to take a.s.k.  Again,
a problem whilst PGP users are thin on the ground but one which disappears
when there are enough to make the distribution logjam a serious possibility.

It was my understanding that at least one of the servers does scan a.s.k,
though this may have changed, or I may simply be confused.  It certainly
makes sense for servers to scan a.s.k.

I know that servers operate as peers, but if servers *were* to post to
a.s.k it would simplify matters if only one designated server were
responsible for posting keys.  Yes, you could design a message format so
other servers didn't re-post, but there's less traffic if only one server
posts.

Yeah, I learnt about this command shortly after my original post.  Now it's
been implemented (and PGP 2.3 has been modified so the multiple keys don't
crash DOS PGP) many of my original reasons for suggesting a.s.k are no
longer as valid.

I think something has to be done.  You see problems with the implementation,
I see problems with the user interface, but if nothing is done PGP will
become unacceptably slow as the number of keys grow.

True, but I have a lot more confidence in a keyring *I* maintain than one
which is remotely accessed.

It might be easy, but is it a good idea?  If, as the original poster
suggested, the UDP server supplants personally maintained keyrings then I
would say it is a bad idea.  If the UDP server supplements personally
maintained rings when a key cannot be found then it might be worthwhile.

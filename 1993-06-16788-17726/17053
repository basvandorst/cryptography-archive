 Having been peripherally involved in some crypto circuit developments, I
have less than complete confidence in the quality/integrity of hardware
designed by some government agencies. I should emphasize that this is 
personal opinion, I guess. See disclaimer. 

 I guess it'll be up to the Japanese to develop the hardware implementation
of bug- and hole-free crypto algorithms for personal communications. The
wireless communication systems will require it. Japan already has a pretty
advanced satellite direct wireless phone constellation either up or close.
I doubt any Iridium customers will want to have their conversations monitored
by hams, scanner buffs, police or spooks either. When the wireless telecom
mass market explodes you can bet the real commercial solution will supersede
this cold war bureaucratic power play. In a few years this "Clipper" will be
obsolescent anyhow, I expect. The progress of the free world has little to
do with Washington posturing, which is why there is progress.

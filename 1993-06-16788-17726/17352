  I expect that after the legal obstacles to PGP clear up (as it surely will
one way or another: either PKP will make their peace with PGP, or their patent
will fail to stand up in court, or their patent will expire), there will be
various central keyservers, which each user will selectively incorporate into
his web of trust.

  The issue of whether foreign governments could obtain copies of people's
Clipper keys seems to resolve into one of three possibilities:

  1. Foriegn governments (at least, the governments of all countries that
are "respectable" by the standards of the world community) have equal access
to the Clipper escrow database.

  2. Foriegn governments are shut out of the Clipper database, and therefore
do whatever they can within the contexts of their own legal systems to keep
Clipper out of the regions they control (since, from their perspective, it
would be strong crypto with no government back door, which is an idea
universally loathed by People In Power).  This would result in a hodge-podge
of national encryption standards, with all the obvious disadvantages to the
global economy.

  3. Foreign governments decide that they don't really mind having to get
permission from a couple of American escrow agencies every time they want
to listen in on domestic Clipper traffic.

  I include possibility 3 for the sake of completeness, not because I think
there is a snowball's chance in Hades that it can happen.  I would not want
to be the one to suggest this policy to the head of the Surete. ;-)

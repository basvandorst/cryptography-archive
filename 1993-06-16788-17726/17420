Paul, maybe I am missing a point (or two, sic) but in the nonPGP world 
the idea of key certification is being based on X.509 standard. BTW the
X.509 is a part of X.500 suite, which is the basis for the building of 
directory services (quite a big effort within the RARE group of academic 
networks in Europe). The directory service also needs what is called 
strong binding to the person's ID.

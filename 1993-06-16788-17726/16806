Is it exportable?  The site maintainers on ripem seem to think not, as
they have not made it accessible to all:

-rw-r-----  1 mrr      ftpsec      19079 Jan 22 04:28 nist-secure-hash-standard.c

Actually, in the same directory we find the completely ridiculous

-rw-r-----  1 mrr      ftpsec        336 Oct  8  1992 rot13.c

(ditto for crc) so obviously they are just playing it safe.  But md4
and md5 *used* to be exported all over the world, and I think they
still do, in the form of RFCs if nothing else.

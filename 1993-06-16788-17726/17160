Which brings me to a question i've wanted to ask - would it be necessary to
outlaw other forms of encryption or would something such as the RICO laws
be sufficient?  Would it be possible for law enforcement agencies to simply
asume that the use of non-Clipper cryptography is sufficient evidence of
criminal intent to subject the user to civil forfeiture?  If this is
true then non-Clipper cryptography could disappear simply through
intimidation.

A separate group to protect against USENET idiocy may have precedent,
but it seems like an inelegant solution to me.  "sci.crypt" makes
perfect sense as the name of a group devoted to the science of
cryptography.

By the same token, "talk.politics.crypt" makes perfect sense as the
name of a group on which people talk about the politics of
cryptography.

Nothing will eliminate political posts from the research newsgroup.
As has already been pointed out, however, a thorough (but polite)
e-mail campaign will go a long way toward that goal.

Anyone care to write a proposal?

Unless I misunderstand something, I find the post below to be rather less
than candid. RSAREF is not licensable outside the U.S. and Canada as the
author well knows, and the version of PGP that I spoke of is one written
entirely in the U.S. (and/or Canada) to use RSAREF in the U.S. (and Canada)

The last posting I read about the U.S. version said it was in preparation,
and that RSA had given permission to make the necessary modifications to
RSAREF (which is the only thing that needs to be licensed) so that it would
work with PGP.

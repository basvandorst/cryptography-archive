Summary: Is this Clipper?

In today's _Wall Street Journal_, page B6, there's a half-page
ad:  "HOW TO TRAVEL WITH A SENSE OF SECURITY [..] And you never
know who might be listening to the conversation.  That's why you should
find out more about AT&T's new portable Surity(TM) Telephone Device.
Designed by AT&T Bell Laboratories, it's one of the smallest security
solutions available anywhere, just 4 inches x 7 1/4 inches.  [..]
Just plug it into any phone and your conversation is instantly
protected.  [..]"

The ad has a little photo of a device which seems to have two telephone
jacks; presumably you connect one to the phone and one to the wall.
It's not clear whether it needs any other power source.  If it
doesn't, presumably this kind of function will shrink to cigarette-pack
size soon, like modems..

Does anyone know whether this is a Clipper product?  I assume so, but
I was under the impression that the big push for Clipper would be as 
something built into phones.

  This policy stipulates that Clipper will be a USA-only standard.  Any
foreign government faced with this policy would tell the manufacturer to
stick their chips where the sun don't shine, treat Clipper as an
unbreakable system outside its control (i.e. discourge or even prohibit
it, depending on the level of freedom guaranteed by local law and custom),
and start pushing its own standard.

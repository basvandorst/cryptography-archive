   How would we know, outside of being involved heavily in every major
investigation in every country on the planet, what phone conversations
were relevant to an ongoing investigation?  Virtually *every* major
company has *someone* doing *something* at least legally questionable--
simply because of ignorance, ambiguity of laws, etc.  (Not to mention
employees who use the company's resources to help along their own criminal
enterprises.)
 
   Also, wouldn't the French/UK/whomever government also be concerned about
national security being harmed by encrypted phone links they couldn't break?
Maybe the CIA's running an operation in France, and they don't want to talk
to the French government about it.
 
   And, this still doesn't deal with the rubber-stamp crypanalysis that's
sure to go on in the US and elsewhere....

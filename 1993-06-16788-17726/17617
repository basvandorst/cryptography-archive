Once the clipper (key escrow) chip has been manufactured, it is returned
to Mykotronx. You can (according to some documents) buy the chip at this
stage. It is completely unprogrammed. Mykotronx loads the keys *and*
the microcode to implement the Skipjack alogorithm onto the chip. 

Thus, once the microcode leaks out (as it probably will do), and given 
the fact that there is a supply of blank chips, it seems highly likely
that there will be a supply of non-escrowed chips (pin compatible)
available. Note that reverse engineering the chip is not required,
it is just a small (?) amount of (classified) software that is required. 

How could this be smuggled out of the secure facility? I assume that
the Clipper chip is programmed, and then verified. At this point a
security fuse (as in a PAL) is blown to prevent further readout. If
an engineer modifies the programming instructions to *omit* the 
security fuse blowing, then each clipper chip will contain the
internal microcode in a readable form. The standard procedure
will now ship these chips out of the secure facility. The engineer
merely need obtain one of these chips to read out the microcode.

Of course, the test procedures will probably verify that the security
fuse was blown, but ........

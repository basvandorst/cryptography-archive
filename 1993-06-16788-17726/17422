As others have pointed out, any system with a one-time key as long as the
message to be transmitted is a one-time pad. The only secure one-time key is
a *truly* random one. Which leads on to...

Bad idea, as the key will have the same letter frequencies as English text.

>random-number generators
>with fresh seeds for each OTP;

Bad idea. With a little known plaintext, the cryptanalyst can identify some
of the key. All the common pseudo-random number generators have identifying
characteristics, so the cryptanalyst can probably identify the algorithm
used to generate the key. And since each member of the pseudo-random 
sequence depends uniquely on those that came before...

Bad idea. Humans seem to be very bad at generating random seuquences (try it!)

I could continue, but...

>How exactly is a OTP really generated in a secure fashion?

From something truly random. Two common examples:

1) Sampled radioactive decay
2) Sampled, amplified quantum noise from a resistor

You can also use the least significant bit of any microphone input to your
system. The sci.crypt FAQ suggests, on a SPARCstation,

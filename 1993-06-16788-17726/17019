Because I know enough about the NSA's technical skills from the public
record, and as I said many messages ago, in this case the government's
motives are to protect our economic traffic against adversaries--that makes
the background of shared interests one that I believe I can rely on.

Finally, I think it paranoid to suggest that the key escrow is an elaborate
hoax and that Clipper is crackable without it by the NSA.  Thus I believe
Clipper to be secure if the keys are protected. Since escrow agencies
haven't been named nor protections spelled out, and they'd have to be before
the scheme would be accepted by anyone sensible, I'm keeping an open mind on
that one.

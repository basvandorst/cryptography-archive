Hi.  I am new to data encryption using DES.

Could anybody tell me if I encrypt a plain text P1 with key K1 using DES,
 then I use key K2 to decrypt the encrypted text, will it be possible for me to get back a different plain text P2? Or will it always be a non-printable string as long as I did not use back the same key to decrypt the encrypted text?

Thank you.

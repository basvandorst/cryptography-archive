as a kick, i added my pgp key as a txt rr to citi.umich.edu's dns
database.  check it out.

i don't suggest this approach, though, since it will bloat the dns
database (not a major concern) and requires administrative access
for maintainance (fatal flaw).  

i prefer advertising my pgp key in my .plan file, making it available 
to internet colleagues via finger.  

for email access, the  key servers are doing an adequate job now, with
their  listserv/netlib/however-you-want-to-think-of-it approach.  and
when that fails, an email message requesting your correspondent's pgp
key seems reasonable.

describing the keyserv protocol in an internet rfc seems to me to be of
marginal utility, except perhaps for the positive p.r.  ("see what good
net citizens we are, we write rfc's.")

summary:  if ip-connected, use finger, o.w., use the key servers.

ps:  i agree, btw, that thousands of folks maintaining "universal" 
personal pgp key files is unproductive.  even though i do it myself ...

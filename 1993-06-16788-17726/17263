Perhaps we're asking the wrong question.  If Clipper contains an
entropy detection algorithm, one only needs to binhex encrypted
data for Clipper to believe it's plaintext, and pass it through
with a green light.

I doubt any hardware based solution that can encrypt data as
quickly as Clipper can do more than a *very* rudimentary test of
entropy.  Decoding binhex and measuring the entropy of the
resulting output might be among its suite of obvious tests, but
it can't be THAT difficult for a clever person to make encrypted
data look more like plaintext (with the resulting loss in data
transmission/storage efficiency, naturally) without giving away
any hints on the original encryption method used.

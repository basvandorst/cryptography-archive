(Why is this only in sci.crypt and not also alt.security.pgp?)

I personally find PGP-signed messages (and PEM signed messages) sort
of annoying for most USENET postings; it has useful application for
some important messages, for cancels, for moderated groups, postings
where security is important, people who have been forged before, etc.
but I hardly think it necessary for everything for the moment.  I
spent several hours hacking up my newsreader to allow me to trivially
sign news postings with RIPEM, but I almost never actually use that
feature.

Really?  So, if PGP were to have a million users, you would be willing
to maintain your own personal copy of a million different keys which
would probably have well over a thousand modifications, additions,
revocations, name changes, various irregularities, and the like per
day and keep it up to date?  And so would everybody else?  I doubt it.
Just the time to verify a thousand signatures per day would keep your
computer busy for quite a while.  An effective system would fetch
needed keys, cache recently-used ones, have key revocation lists (or
CRLs), and the like.

However, it doesn't seem to me that DNS is the best model, given that
the original posting suggested a batch-oriented server (i.e. one that
responds to mail requests rather than socket attachments.)  A batch
server doesn't have the real-time response requirements that DNS does,
and thus doesn't need to be as widely distributed.

It will be interesting to see how these things develop.

Such targets are all the time required to turn over *property* which
may be used as evidence against them; but they are never *legally*
required to testify against themselves. (Of course, they're quite
frequently subject to "rubber-hose" testimony... but it's never quite
legal).  If an physical item reveals a password or secret key, then
that item might be subpoenaed, but *testimony* about a password or key
cannot be required.  The moral here:  *remember* your password, and
don't leave written copies around.

Yours, Lulu...

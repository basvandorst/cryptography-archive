I have one of my HD paritions compressed with Feal encryption. Unlike stacker,
the whole partiotion isn't joined together in one file, but every file is
encrypted for itself. (I have to type in the PW whenver I want to use this
partition.)

Say somebody get's their hands on all of my data and has a file that exactly
matches one of the files I have on the HD. (For example a text file.)

I suppose it would the be QUITE easy to find the find the pw and decrypt the
rest of the partition?

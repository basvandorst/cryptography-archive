Making an encryptor *fail* any particular test is easy.
Just add, say, bytes whose value is 0.

More interesting is the problem of making the stream pass
or fail any given test without adding superfluous bits,
i.e., not decreasing the signal data rate for the channel.

It of course can be done (for example just keep trying different
DES keys for your message until you fail by Gaussian bad luck
any particular test).  But this is rather slow and probabilistic.

Sorry but my "gerrymandering" the boundaries is based on messages by others
about possible weaknesses of RSA and DES. I am not sufficiently expert to do
such analyses myself, but rely on those posting here who seem to be so
expert.

As for "paranoid rantings" those I question are not about the security or
lack of security of a particular cryptographic system, but about conspiracy
theories, evil back-room plots, etc. etc. I do not consider such messages in
the same domain as messages about the technical security of cryptographic
systems.

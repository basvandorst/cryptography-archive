   Wait!  Are you talking about Key Certification or Key Distribution.
   PLEASE do not confuse the two.  They are totally separate issues.

They are separate issues, but they can be solved together, as they are
in Domain Name Service - that's why it works so well.
In DNS, if you're managing a domain foo.bar.com, you get to assign the
names and addresses, and you provide a nameserver so that people who
want to talk to splat.foo.bar.com can find the address you assigned.
The can also find the address other ways, and caching goes on, and
such, but the nameserver is a well-defined easy-to-locate service.

Similarly, if you wanted to do a hierarchical key certification system,
one way to do it would be to have each certifier provide key distribution
for the addresses it certifies.  Names might or might not parallel the
DNS names; you could have splat.foo.bar.com certified by foo.bar.com or
   person1@splat.foo.bar.com;keymaster@host2.hoople.usnd.edu;pca@rsa.com

In the latter approach, there's nothing to prevent foo.bar.com
from *also* distributing keys for machines in its domain,
but keymaster@host2.hoople.usnd.edu would have the primary responsibility
for person1@splat.foo.bar.com.  It also (at the cost of ugly names),
solves the problem of deciding *who* at foo.bar.com is certifier -
is it keymaster@foo.bar.com, or the DNS, or some new  well-known-port-number,
or Joe.Administrator@foo.bar.com?  

As other people have pointed out, you probably want to support
multiple distribution mechanisms, including email and something
udp-based and/or tcp-based.

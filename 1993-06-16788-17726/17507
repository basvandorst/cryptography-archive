If you are not a citizen of a country and you are not in that country then it
is difficult for that country to actually enforce any laws that it feels you
are breaking.

In this example I would feel that unless you specifically intended it to go
through the US you had not broke any laws.

However whoever did knowingly route it had.

This is why the airline reservation system between Canada and Cuba was
recently cut by a US company.  They felt that if they didn't they would be
prosecuted.  No one is suggesting prosecuting those Canadian travel agents
booking flights to Cuba.

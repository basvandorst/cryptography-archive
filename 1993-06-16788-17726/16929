I've been studying the Defense Department's "black budget" (classified
spending on research & development). Using info from the National Defense
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993 (House of Representatives report
102-527) my guess is that DOD by itself (not counting the military services)
spends roughly $1 billion per year on crypto R&D. This number is arrived at
by simple arithmetic for listed intelligence programs in the group that
includes crypto R&D. It includes $1.273 billion for classified programs
including communications security (COMSEC) and crypto. My sum of one billion
dollars is my estimate of Defense Program Elements 0301011G-Cryptologic
Activities & 0305885G-Tactical Cryptologic Activities. This doesn't include
operational costs of the NSA or other spooks. (If you glance through the
budget documents NSA, the National Reconnaissance Office, and the CIA don't
cost the taxpayers a cent because they aren't mentioned. Whoops - forgot the
unclassified amount of $169 million for the CIA pension and disability fund).

The NSA would have a coronary if American industry spent $1 billion year
on crypto R&D!! Just to put the numbers of Ms. Denning's employers in
perspective -- Mattel Toys typically has about $1.5 billion in sales in
a good year. By the way - don't count on Congress to cut the funding of
NSA -- although the actual amounts spent on crypto are classified, the
House Armed Services Committee voted to give the spooks another $33.5 million
more for crypto R&D than they requested...

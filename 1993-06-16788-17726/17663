Since fecund speculation about clipper runs rampant here, perhaps I may be
forgiven for adding one of my own--that we will end up even worse off than
heretofore--namely no clipper AND no secure crypto.  That is--a non-escrowed
Clipper will be made available to large corporations for internal use in
their communications centers, with the responsibility for insuring that the
plaintext is "legal" being left to them, while the rest of us get not only
no Clipper but also are prohibited from, say, Triple DES, etc.

What I'm trying to suggest is that in a situation requiring a compromise
between conflicting policy interests, being intransigent can often backfire.

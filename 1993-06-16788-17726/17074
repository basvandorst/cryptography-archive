:   I consider all of this discussion of Dorothy Denning very distasteful,
:   reflecting great discredit on this forum.  Some posters have suggested 
:   that her unpopular views be punished with a boycott, others have suggested 
:   that she is incompetent to discuss politics, and another has suggested 
:   that most of her research has been politicaly correct and hence she 
:   should be gently nudged back into the correct line of thought.
:   Why does anything about her (as opposed to what she writes) matter to
:   the net?  How presumptuous for some nettie to try to nudge her research
:   career this way or that way because of his opinion of her politics!

	Well, most of the arguments have attacked D.Denning's ideas,
and not her personally.  I do hope my own arguments were interpreted
that way (as was my intention when writing).  However, the net is very
large, and a great number of people are allowed to express their views.
Some of them will be acerbic.  
	When one expresses strong opinions, strong responses may result.
	If readers view the enforcement of an encryption method as 
being against their own interests, then the boycott of products that
use that encryption method is a reasonable response.

   Dunno about PEM, but PGP is not, as you know, freely distributable in the
   U.S., and has been removed by university authorities from their sites on
   which it has shown up.  A more accurate statement is that the PGP authors
   have no objection to free distribution, but others, claiming it is a patent
   infringement in the U.S., do, and carry enough weight for whatever reason
   that whenever they've asked for PGP to be removed or work discontinued on it
   in the U.S., the recipients of such requests have complied.

PGP *is* freely distributable in the US, even though the RSA algo is patented.
There's a difference between possessing PGP and using its RSA functions
for key exchange.  Dorothy Denning's book, which describes the RSA algorithms
in reasonable detail, focussing on the mathematics behind it, doesn't
violate the patent**, because it isn't performing the functions described,
it's only describing them.  Similarly, PGP describes RSA in considerable
detail, focussing on implementation techniques, with examples.

*Running* PGP and using it for key exchange presumably violates the patents,
though nobody's clearly established whether the violation occurs at
the time you generate a public key, the time you use somebody's public key 
to send them a session key, or the time you use your private key to
decode the message somebody sent you encoded with your public key.

Just because something *is* freely redistributable doesn't mean
somebody can't try to sue you for doing it, and most universities
presumably would take the conservative approach of avoiding the
lawsuit by complying.

**(yeah, you can quibble about publication vs patent award dates, but
she also describes Diffie-Hellman, which was awarded by then.
And the book is, of course, not freely redistributable because she's
copyrighted it and choses to charge money for it :-)

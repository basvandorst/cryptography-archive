Remember the importance of informants in gathering evidence. It may be
more to the advantage of law-enforcement to get the recipient of an
encrypted signed message to decrypt it voluntarily (as in, if you
don't do this voluntarily, we'll send you to the gallows). The issue
of verifying Henry's public key in order to link him to the signed
message, ``I'd sure be glad if that annoying archbishop would sleep
with the fishes.'' would make for an interesting case.

And maybe you don't really want to sign everything you send to the net.
It could kinda ruin your plausible deniability.

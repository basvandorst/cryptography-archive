   Article in Crypt '88 procedings:  "Speeding up Secrte Computations with
                                      Insecure Auxillary Devices," by Matsumo,
                                      Kato, and Imai.
 
   This discusses various ways of splitting up the processing of some task
that requires some information remain secret.  For RSA, they propose:
 
   (Public key (e,N), secret key d; N = p*q; phi(N) = (p-1)*(q-1)
 
1.  Generate an array of integers X and an array of bits F such that
      X_0*F_0 + X_1*F_1 + X_2 * F_2 + ... + X_k*F_k = d (modulo phi(N))
 
2.  Submit the message, C, and the array of integers X, to the insecure
    device.  That device calculates Z, an array of integers, so that:
       Z_i = C ** X_i mod N
 
3.  Calculate the decrypted message, M, from Z and F by calculating:
       Y_0 = 1
       For i = 1 to k:
            If F_i = 0 then Y_i = Y_(i-1)
                       else Y_i = Y_(i-1) * Z_i mod N
 
   There is an improved version of this scheme to allow use of the Chinese
Remainder Theorem to speed up the RSA decryption, with the smartcard knowing
p and q.
 
   My only problem with this is that it's going to require a really large
increase in the insecure device's computing power, since we're multiplying
the workload for RSA decryption by k.  (k is the number of elements in our
arrays above.)  Also, k needs to be pretty large for this scheme to remain
secure.  (Also, the minimum number of F_i bits set to one shouldn't be too
small.)  This might mean that you'd use an EFT terminal that contained
a PC with one or more specially designed RSA accellerator chips.  This would
make the terminals pretty expensive, I'd guess.  On the other hand, on slow
days, maybe the terminals could farm out further processing to one another.
 
   Has anyone else seen this article?  Comments?

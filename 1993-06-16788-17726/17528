Really?  Hagelin has been selling a variety of cryptographic
equipment from Switzerland since 1959.  Some of it used to be
deliberately weakened by US request, indeed Hagelin supplied rotor
wirings to the NSA on at least some occasions.  However, Hagelin
also sold (and I presume still sells) what certainly appear to be
(unbreakable if used properly) one-time-pad systems, to a rather
broad range of customers.

Kahn p.432-434 describes the author's interview with Hagelin, his
tour through the factor, and some of the machines Hagelin sold as
of ~1966.

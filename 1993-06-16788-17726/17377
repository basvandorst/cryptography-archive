   Privacy?  Let them get your Clipper key ONCE.  Say, tomorrow.
How do you prevent them from decrypting ALL your telephone conversations
from tomorrow until eternity?  How would you even KNOW?
   Personally, I make sure that I include the words "plutonium", "arms
sales to Iraq", "secret missile fuel", "bomb sight", etc. into EVERY
telephone conversation.  (Usually it's in the context of "Don't say
anything about the Plutonium stash, the arms sale deal to Iraq, etc.")

   As far as I'm concerned, someone who knows much more about sophisticated
and highly pernicious propaganda is someone who has a VERY large role in
a group such as sci.crypt.
   Paranoia is paramount.  How secure are YOUR cryptexts?  Presumably, you bave
NO paranoia about your encryption method.  God bless you.  You've achieved
what none of us in the discussion group have managed.
   I've posted my algorithm to the net; presumably, the NSA and CIA have
it.  Where's YOUR encryption system??  Or are you so self-aggrandizing
that you presume YOUR system is unbreakable?

   So very true. So VERY true.

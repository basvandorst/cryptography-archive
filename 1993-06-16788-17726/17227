With respect to one-time pads, one wonders what it would cost if a
mass-marketed system were available? I have in mind the cost of two
magneto-optical disk drives (maybe $1200 each now, and coming down), the
software to use the disks which would contain the one-time pad, and a
program to write pairs of disks with random info (perhaps with a special
purpose device that listens to cosmic rays or some such). Are there cheaper
ways to do it "electronically".

We've come a long way from the laborious hand use of real, physical one-time
pads.

Still, it's hard to imagine it could be remotely as cheap as Clipper or some
similar non-escrowed system--at $25 per chip we're talking about $50-$100
per pair. 

Perhaps more importantly, any such chip can talk to any other without third
Clipper phones (assuming non-escrow) being able to listen in--not possible
with one-time pads without a big security risk. Either each pair of
correspondents has a different shared one-time pad, or people with a common
pad can read each other's traffic with a little effort.

One-time pads are probably only economically feasible for extreme security
specific two-party links, but likely don't make much sense for much of the
target "Clipper" audience.

This summarizes the problem of civilian review of highly classified matters
very nicely. At some point you have to trust someone, and it can't be every
Tom, Dick or Mary or you lose the security you're trying to preserve.

I think this was an attempt to separate the classified crypto community from
the civilian one. It couldn't, and didn't work because NIST and others need
the best expert advice they can get and that is, at least in part, at the
NSA. The reason for this is that our crypto adversaries don't make such nice
distinctions, and thus our civilian crypto is vulnerable not to their best
civilian crypto, or what is known in the open literature, but to their best
classified crypto. The French and Japanese governments are but two examples.

I don't agree all that the NSA is a very dangerous agency. It's a bunch of
technicians, tasked by the intelligence community, and with a strong
civilian review board responsible to the civilian Secretary of Defense and
to the President.

Again, in classified matters you have to trust some ultimate authority, and
in our system it's the President and the appropriate oversight committees of
Congress.

I believe this to be flat inaccurate. Check your facts before writing. I
suggest a letter to the Chairman of the appropriate Senate and House
intelligence committees.

I believe this to be untrue. The black budget IS hidden in the unclassified
materials for obvious national security reasons, but is not hidden from
the appropriate Congressional oversight and budgetary committees, nor from
the Office of Management and Budget. Specific program authorities need
review and approval--the NSA is very far from a "loose cannon." Again,
before writing this up and embarassing yourself, check with the appropriate
Congressional sources of info. You may even be pleasantly surprised at what
you get back if you also check with the NSA's public information office.

This is a concatenation of misinformation. Shamrock, as I understand it, was
in aid of the NSA's monitoring of conversations with a foreigner on one end.
That's legal if that end is overseas. (For details write Congress). 

There is no evidence I'm aware of that the NSA monitored political targets.
I think that to be flat untrue and before repeating such a calumny you
better check your info.

Oh come on, I doubt that "Using DES is like sending in the clear as far
as the NSA is concerned". 

What is more likely true is that "Using DES means that the NSA can crack
the message in question at not too great a cost". It isn't clear that
they have enough computing power to crack all of the DES messages
they capture.

Note that RSADSI gave the RIPEM developers permission to put triple
DES into RIPEM. Triple DES is also due to be part of TIS/PEM, once 
the right people agree on what the phrase "triple DES" really means.

Given your belief that PKP and RSADSI are NSA stooges, you must believe 
that the NSA can crack triple DES but not IDEA. 

Triple DES with either a 112 bit or 168 bit keyspace, isn't 
vunerable to the sort of brute-force attack that DES is. 

You can speculate all you want that the NSA can crack triple DES
but not IDEA. I certainly won't buy it, without some other evidence.

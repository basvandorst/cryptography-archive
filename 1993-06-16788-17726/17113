This seems to be an extreme position to take, I haven't seen Dorothy Denning
say that Clipper is *the solution for all secure communication* [tm].
It seems that she is drawing on her knowledge of cryptography and her other
experience, to say that Clipper can give personal security yet not hamper
law enforcement agencies investigating 'organised crime'.  Whether Clipper,
key escrow, etc.. will work in this way is clearly open to debate, but
I see no inherent technical reason why it can't.

I hesitate to mention the perceived weaknesses, (the NSA's design criteria,
'backdoors', ...), but they are all poltical rather than based on the
available technical information.  Politics is about discussion, disagreement,
compromise.  But all the personal attacks on Denning because she defends the
technology are (IMHO) spurious.

BTW, anybody who wants to understand Denning is advised to read her book
    (not in the 1993 Addison-Wesley catalogue, but available on request
    ISBN 0-201-10150-5), and perhaps read about her (eg she receives a
    little coverage in Bruce Sterling's 'The Hacker Crackdown').

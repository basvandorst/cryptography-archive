  Fermat's Last Theorem states that, for any positive integers a,b,c, 
and n, and n > 2 (or maybe 3, I can't remember offhand which) there
is no solution for the following:
a^n + b^n = c^n .
  A couple of years ago, a Japanese mathematician found a contrary
case, thereby DISproving the theorem.   
   The conjecture of Fermat that was confirmed has no real
relevance to cryptography, as Mr. Silverman said.

   Someone proposed the idea of XORing the data from two different CDs.
Doesn't sound bad to me, especially with different pressings of the same
CD (with presumably different "serial numbers").  Which pressing of
"Brotherhood" was being used to generate the OTP?  Sure, they can try them
all, but if other recordings are done the same way (multiple pressings),
just two CDs os that sort can generate 9 permutations.  Include another
and run that up to 27. One more, 81.  And so on. It could conceivably tax
the power of the Crays at NSA eventually.

:However, I think that the brute-force approach is becoming increasingly
:infeasible -- there are thousands of commercial CDs released across the
:world every month (in the music industry alone)! Perhaps the NSA will become
:the best CD library in the world :-)

   Perhaps... perhaps they'd find it infeasible in light of the sheer number
of permutations of XORing three or more CDs as a OTP.  Especially if you make
sure that your CDs are not susceptible to raids (borrow some, keep some at
a friend's house, etc.).

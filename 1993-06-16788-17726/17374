A "true" one-time pad is a random (as opposed to pseudo-random) number
stream that is combined with the message, i.e. a stream of random bits
that is XORed with your ASCII message.  This requires a key of the same
length as the message, and each key can be used only once.  If a key is
reused, then it's no longer a one-time pad.  All of the schemes that you
described are not one-time pads.  Choosing letters from a book is not
necessarily (or even very likely to be) random.  Consider the differing
frequencies for e and x for example.  The "random" number generators
that are implemented in software are deterministic, although if designed
well they will not show an obvious pattern.  If you want a truly random
source, you have to get away from software solutions and actually
construct something that will record numbers based on truly random
events such as radioactive decays.  

For a description of some systems similar to the schemes you described
and why they are no longer in use, see Kahn's "The Codebreakers"

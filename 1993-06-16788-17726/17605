Not by any meaning that I can discern.  Cryptography is a discipline
which draws on mathematics, statistics, complexity theory, computer
science, electrical and computer engineering, and physics.

Cryptography has nothing to do with understanding politics, which is
what 'political science' means.  You are confusing the application of
the science with the science itself.

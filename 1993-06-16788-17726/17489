I'm interested in cryptography sources that may be available via the net
which:

o	Are reasonably secure

o	Compile on MSDOS systems

o	Produce programs which are useful in a practical sense.

I'm interested in learning more about the mathematics of cryptography, and
I'd like to start digging through some software that's a little bit easier
to wade through than PGP.

I've found tangle, which seems to fit my criteria perfectly, except that I
don't know what algorithm it's based on or whether or not it's considered
to be a solid program.

Ideally, I'd like to be able to get ahold of sources, get them to run, and
then look up the algorithms somewhere (such as in Denning's text) to get a
better understanding of how they work.

If anyone can point me in the direction of anything like this, I'd be
grateful.

Thanks,

	Alex

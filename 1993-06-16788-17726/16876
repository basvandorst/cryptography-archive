The effect of adding one comsec on top of another "zillion bit trapdoor
encryption scheme" layered on ( or under) Clipper is called Tandem-ing. 
The strength of the end message is the same as that of the *strongest* 
system (not the weakest, however you define that).   It is very difficult
for one tandem-ed system to interfere with another.  The data out of one
should look like  *random* data into the next, and if a system is "good"
it shouldn't care what the data in looks like.  It becomes an onion
problem to the outside world.  You can't get to the center (message)
until you get through the toughest layer.  

One of the more obivious features from tandem-ing is the ability to "keep
the courier from peeking".

Re "shortcuts" in decoding messages:

I recently read Steven Levy's new "Artificial Life" and a related book
with sample programs from the Waite Group called "Artificial Life
Playhouse" which explore "cellular automata" and other computer-based
"life" models.  One of the examples was a "world" in which code-based
"agents" interbred and mutated, and were selected based on their ability
to perform a "target" task: sorting data.  In an amazingly short time,
this "code soup" evolved short and efficient algorithms, and soon after,
had matched the shortest, most efficient algorithm discovered to date.

In short, coding through "evolution" does an amazing job of making the
"thousand monkeys at a thousand keyboards" far more efficient at
reaching a desired goal -- the same concepts could be applied, I'd
think, to the task of decoding messages.  Hmmm...

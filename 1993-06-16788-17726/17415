That they want people to use shorter keys reveals *NOTHING* about their 
capability:
 
Suppose they can crack a 128 bit key in only 2 days work, but they can 
crack a 64 bit key in just under half an hour.  Now, if everyone used a 
128 bit key they could listen in on about 180 conversations a year.  On 
the other hand, if everyone was using a 64 bit key they could listen in 
on over 17,000 conversations a year.  
 
Reducing the ease with which something can be cracked simply expands the 
scope of their listening power.  With a 128 bit key under the above 
scenario they would be limited to snooping in only on things that were 
*really* important.  With a 64 bit key, with the above, it can become 
almost a routine thing.

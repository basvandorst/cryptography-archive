which shows us once more that paranoia is its own punishment.
You can't trust the French, period ? I can't trust NSA for anything. Could
you ?

I hope that now that Mr Sternlight has seen the real danger (French spys
covering as law enforcement agencies), he will actively campaign against
the whole Clipper thing.

Why am I interested ? Because unfortunately, if US citizens have at least a
say in the final decision, we Europeans won't really discuss the matter
before
long. Now, if the US have already adopted this horrible scheme, the
military
establishment and other adversaries of civil rights will have an easy time
imposing us the same sort of SoftJail.

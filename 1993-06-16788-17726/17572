I know about both and they have NO relation to them. The elliptic
curve crypto systems are simply the discrete log problem applied to
the Mordell-Weil group on elliptic curves.  This has nothing to 
do [well, nothing in a cryptographic sense] with the Taniyama-Weil
conjecture.

I did not say that elliptic curves were irrelevent to cryptography.
Only that the proof by Prof. Wiles had no real relevence.

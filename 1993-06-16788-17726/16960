Actually, I recall that NP stands for Nondeterministic Polynomial.
NP-hard problems of size N can be completed in O(N**x) (i.e.,
polynomial) steps if executed on a hypothetical computer with an
infinite number of processors, where at each decision point, processors
are spawned to track down each possible decision path, ad infinitum (a
nondeterministic finite automaton).

Yes, they exist. I have seen a board demonstrated on a PC. The crypto chip was
roughly a square inch in size. The marketing man claimed it could run a
single block through RSA using a 1024 bit key in less than 20 ms.

The demonstration took place at a security seminar organized by Digital here
in Holland. The chip/board was not developed at DEC; if I remember correctly
at a site of Philips that is no longer part of Philips but of Digital.

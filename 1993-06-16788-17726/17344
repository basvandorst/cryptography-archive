I think the phrase "superencryption of the Law Enforcement Block"
refers to an attempt to encrypt just that portion of the *ciphertext
output* of the Clipper Chip that carries the Law Enforcement Block in
an attempt to use the high speed of the chip without opening yourself
up to a wiretap. This could be done by somehow scattering the LEB
throughout the ciphertext in such a way that you'd have to
super-encrypt *all* of the ciphertext, presumably in relatively slow
software, in order to be sure of getting the LEB. And in this case you
might as well superencrypt before Clipper, in order to avoid drawing
attention to yourself. I can't imagine that even a Clipper chip would
refuse to encrypt data with "too much" entropy, however you might
define that.

BTW, one additional serious practical drawback to Clipper that hasn't
been widely mentioned yet is the redesign burden it places on many
existing communication systems, especially those that operate
synchronously (like digital voice).  For example, our CDMA digital
cellular system is built around a particular vocoder, with particular
frame sizes and data rates, and a radio modem designed specifically to
support those exact rates. It is simply not possible to "drop in" a
Clipper chip because there's no bandwidth left over for the LEB.

Encryption that would not increase the data rate is not a problem, but
we didn't do that either (even though it would have been easy to
implement in in software using leftover CPU cycles) due to
behind-the-scenes NSA pressure on the cellular telecommunications
industry standards process.

A great quote, but you really have to hear Kallstrom in person to get the
full effect.

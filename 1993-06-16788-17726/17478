I have a better idea: let's all write our ELECTED officials and make it
"computationally infeasible" that they will ignore our hue and cry and
actually DO something about the controls.

: After talking with the people who deal with those requests, I am sure that 
: they would be delighted to have an excuse not to grant any licenses--except 
: to their friends who probably don't have to wait very long now.  As to who 
: those friends are, I don't have the slightest idea, except the suspicion 
: that they are members of the military-industrial complex.
: 
: There is also the danger that those who have licenses would be just as happy 
: if no licenses would be granted to their competitors.  It is not only NSA 
: that wants to preserve the status quo by making it hard to export 
: crytographic programs.
Agreed.

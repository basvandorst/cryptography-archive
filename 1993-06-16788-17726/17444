   than candid. RSAREF is not licensable outside the U.S. and Canada as the
   author well knows, and the version of PGP that I spoke of is one written
   entirely in the U.S. (and/or Canada) to use RSAREF in the U.S. (and Canada)

I suspect that you misunderstand something.  So far as I can tell, there
is no reason whatsoever why RSAREF cannot be licensed for British use.
Agreed, the code may or may not be legally exportable (legally under US
law), but that does not in itself prevent a license from being granted.
If we hypothesise that PKP applies for an export license to provide me
with RSAREF and receives it, it follows that I may then use RSAREF under
the terms of the RSAREF license.

Bidzos' position seems to be that although the RSA patent is not valid
in the UK, RSAREF is protected by copyright in this country.  The
international copyright legislation, which the UK has ratified, assures
PKP of adequate protection should anyone in the UK wish to use RSAREF. I
have asked Bidzos by email about UK use of RSAREF.  Unless *I*
misunderstand something, I have summarized his response, above.

   The last posting I read about the U.S. version said it was in preparation,
   and that RSA had given permission to make the necessary modifications to
   RSAREF (which is the only thing that needs to be licensed) so that it would
   work with PGP.

I cannot say what the position may be with regard to a British version
of PGP with RSAREF.

What I can say is that copies of RSAREF are swilling around Europe (as
are copies of RIPEM, come to that).  Several months ago, rsa.com put
both RSAREF and RIPEM up for anonymous ftp and failed to make any
effective check for non-US or non-Canadian machines downloading it.  Not
being an expert on US law, I refrain from speculating whether that act
constitutes either export or placement in a public library.

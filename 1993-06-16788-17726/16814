For verification, fingerprint < SHS.asc produces the following:

H0b4DsvMCztV3Dm2dryrQetldtf5r0rpKrc0Wz.mjb6mW25X/apO6BxU.iNdkWAi0eJGwv0ckjvR

Oh, wait a minute. Nobody's got the fingerprint program yet, and if
they did, why would they want SHS? Hmmm.

Well, piping the above fingerprint through fptocksum, we get 3336853267
22294; piping it through fptomd5, we get 09bf4316e0f659a7d0c98dd449dbc7d4;
and piping it through fptosnefru, we get this:

 ebf2ed43 29368db3 313a60c0 fe196e54 d766d4b8 58a662e1 b4fea8ee f413fa98

There. Now if you've got cksum, mddriver (for the revised MD5), and/or
snefru 2.5 (with security level 8 and output block size 8), you can
check that you received the same file I did.

Aren't you glad we now have a Secure Hash Standard?

   Nonsense.  All details of the algorithm (except that it is a block
   cipher with an 80 bit key) are secret.  If there has been any hard
   technical information about the core algorithm I haven't seen it.

There's a little more information than that, though not much.  
The Mykotronix blurb says that the algorithm uses S-boxes, and takes
64 clocks to do the encryption; I think someone said it's 32 rounds of
S-boxes, which would correspond well with this.

On the other hand, we don't know if the S-boxes are strong or weak,
which affects the ease of use of differential cryptanalysis,
or whether there are special structures to it, or whether there are
few or many weak keys or how to generate good keys.

My personal speculation is that it's probably about 24-key-bits
stronger than DES, but I don't have a good guess on the weak keys issue.

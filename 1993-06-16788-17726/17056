I think the Hagelin M-209 (used by the US) was stronger than the
Enigma.  (More convenient, too -- it wasn't electric, it was more
portable, and it could be operated quickly and easily by one man in a
foxhole rather than requiring three people (one who reads, one who
types, one who writes down the letter that lights up).

Also, the Germans did not use the Enigma as well as they could have.

Yes -- since the Poles were able to reconstruct the wiring of the
military Enigma machine without being given a copy.  They had an
example of the commercial version.  Enigma decryption was going on
before anybody got a copy of the military Enigma.

Also, you have asked an unfair question -- the fundamental assumption
of cryptography is that security must reside solely in the keys.
You're not allowed to say, "This method is secure as long as nobody
gets a copy of the cipher machine".  Somebody's going to get a copy,
count on it.

A practical cryptosystem must retain its security under multiple-round
adaptive chosen-plaintext chosen-key attack.

Sure!

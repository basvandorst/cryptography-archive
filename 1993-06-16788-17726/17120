  Perhaps you should try to come up with a new reading of Denning, based on
the actual words of the statement rather than something you invented from
Ghod knows where.
  "Law enforcement needs" has nothing whatsoever to do with private business
security against industrial espionage; if that were the object of discussion,
the phrasing would refer to the needs of business rather than the needs of
law enforcement.  In fact, "law enforcement needs" is code language for the
desire of the government to obtain and maintain the ability to monitor private
communications.

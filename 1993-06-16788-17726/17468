Well, however it is found to be by Mr Sternlight, candid it is. Where  
code is written in not relevant. It is clearly understood that PGP 
incorporating RSAREF can only be legally distributed in N.America.

No "US version" requires to be written. All that is necessary is modification
of bindery extant in as well as out of the US, to use RSAREF rather than PRZ's
code for implementation of the RSA algorithm. There would seem to be no candid 
reason why an RSAREF licence for PGP to be distributed only to users in the 
N.America should not have been granted. 

I say again, someone is being more than economical with the truth.

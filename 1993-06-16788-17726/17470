I haven't actually seen the charter either, but I for one find the
political discussion the most interesting part of this group.  I don't
necessarily oppose splitting the group; but I do think it definitely
needs a better reason than just calling the politically-oriented
discussion "ranting."  'Sci.crypt' isn't a particularly high-volume
group, so I hardly think it's getting swamped by political discussion
-- and furthermore, I think it rather naive (or even dangerous) to
wish completely to divorce the political from the technical issues in
cryptography.  As I've said, this isn't necessarily to oppose a split
-- but I'd really like to see someone give some clearly reasoned
arguments for such a split before I'm convinced.

Yours, Lulu...

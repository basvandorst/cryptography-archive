"Stop em when they're small" means when there's a small overt act, not when
you think there might be one someday. So far the government hasn't tried to
ban non-clipper crypto.

I didn't read it that way. In any case, the way to oppose a proposal is to
oppose it, not to oppose some other proposal that's perfectly proper because
it might lead to a second proposal one doesn't like.

In this context I recall an experience I had when I was Chief Economist of
the Atlantic Richfield Company. We bent over backwards to meet
environmentalist's objections to the Alaska Pipeline, even building Caribou
underpasses (which were seldom used--they have photos of Caribou routinely
crossing OVER the pipeline). Each time we met one objection, new ones were
raised. Finally, a major environmental organization admitted that they were
well satisfied with the pipeline design, but the reason they continued to
object to the pipeline design was that they didn't want all that gasolene
coming into the Los Angeles market. They also told me they knew they would
lose the direct discussion on limiting gasolene in LA, so they were trying
to get their way via the back door.

In my view, if that's the objection, one should address it directly and
honestly, and not try to achieve that result by misdirection or disingenuous
argumentation.

Just so with Clipper. If one's problem is that one doesn't want non-Clipper
crypto to be outlawed, one should make the strongest possible case about
that, not fight Clipper because it might maybe lead to that.

This is a major philosophical point which has illumined many policy
debates--it's not new with Clipper. One should, wherever possible, choose
direct policy instruments for achieving results, not try to get them
indirectly. The latter approach results in high social costs and poor policy
instruments.

The debate illumines, for example, much discussion about tax policy as a
revenue raising instrument vs. tax policy as an economic management
instrument.

I don't agree. If Clipper is indeed secure (without the escrow) even against
the NSA itself, then the choice is for the bad guys to use Clipper with
escrow, or to use weaker non-Clipper which might be broken. This is the
subject of vigorous discussion here on technical grounds (a recent post
pointing out, for example, that RSA with 300-odd bit keys was probably NOT
secure against the Connection Machine). It is not "obvious for crying out
loud" by any means.

   technical information about a widely distributed cryptographic program,

Sorry, I cheated.  I hope they treat you leniently.  8-)

   Assignment:  Write a non-interactive program that reads a message and
   writes the rot13 encrypted form as output.  This program must replace

   ...

   form.  Once you compile your program, the following command should
   decrypt this file and list it on your screen:

     % a.out < ~jones/public/rot13

   ...

   Grading criteria:  This problem is worth 5% of your grade.  If you get
   your assignment to work perfectly, you will earn only half of credit.
   The other half will depend on the style of your code and commentary.


You mean that you expect your students to have the current directory in
their path?  If I said that I had to run

"% ./a.out < ~jones/public/rot13"

would I get extra credit?

Yes, I have been bitten by a Trojan.  Some cretin installed a version
of ls(1) as a joke.  It did serious damage.

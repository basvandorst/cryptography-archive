# If this file exists as /etc/skeydconf then local /etc/skeykeys is no
# longer used; a remote TCP connection to <skeyserver> on port
# <skeyport> is attempted. This configuration file should be set
# on all clients; it is safe to set it on the server too.
#
# Distribution of /etc/skeydconf to client sites is left as an
# exercise for the reader.
#
# The <skeypwd> field defines a password for DES encryption/authentication.
# All data transmissions are DES/CFB encrypted.  <skeypwd> can be any length
# and should be the same for all parties, that is, clients and server.
# It is higly advisable to use lenghty pass phrases, since they are
# digested through MD4.  <skeypwd> can not contain spaces, that is, spaces
# are considered field delimeters.

# An example:

skeypwd: this_is_a_strong_passphrase_9243857xckjvhxc,mnbdlkfjhds92840923
skeyserver: 192.168.1.1

.SH NAME

steld \- Secure TELnet server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B steld [
.IR options
] 

.SH DESCRIPTION

.IR steld(8)
is a daemon program for
.CR stel .
.CR steld
accepts and serves connections from clients.  It can be run
standalone or invoked by
.CR inetd . 

When run standalone,
.B steld
listens to port
.B 10005
or the one described by the
.B stel
service by default.  
.B steld
is intended to be run as root; however,
it can be run by a non-privileged user, despite the fact that
the daemon will only be capable of providing remote sessions for
users with UID equal to the UID the daemon is running with.

When invoked by
.CR inetd ,
the
.B inetd.conf
and
.B services
configuration files should be edited accordingly.  For example:

.B "stel stream tcp nowait root /some/where/steld  in.steld -t 28800"



.SH OPTIONS
.B steld
recognizes the following options:
.RS

.TP
.B "-p port"
Use a non standard
.IR port
number.  If 
.B -p
is not used,
.B steld
binds and listens to the standard STEL port.

.TP
.B "-t timeout"
Set idle
.IR timeout
value.  By default, idle time out is zero (disabled). 
.IR timeout
is expressed in minutes.  If set, logged-in user are
disconneted after 
.IR timeout
minutes of inactivity.  This option is useful 
when users have a tendency to forget active connections
unattended, or stay logged to sensitive systems
forever (a bad habit).

.TP
.B -k
Do not
.IR kill
IP options.  Killing of IP options is the default, for security
reasons.  Many attacks, in fact, rely on IP options such as
source routing. This option can be exceptionally useful in
some circumstances.

.RE

.SH DIAGNOSTIC

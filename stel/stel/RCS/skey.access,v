@# This file controls whether UNIX passwords are to be permitted.  Rules
# are matched in order, and the search terminates when the first matching
# rule has been found.
#
# Each rule has the form:
#
#       permit condition condition...
#       deny condition condition...
#
# Where "permit" or "deny" may be followed by zero or more conditions.
#
# A rule is matched when all conditions are satisfied. A rule without
# conditions is always satisfied.
#
# Examples of conditions are:
#
#       hostname wzv.win.tue.nl
#       internet 131.155.210.0 255.255.255.0
#       port     ttya
#       user     root
#       group    wheel
#
# The old S/Key form (permit/deny netnumber netmask) is still supported.
#
#permit user uugiga      # uucp login via modem or internet
#permit port ttyb        # local
#permit port console     # local
#hostname idea.sec.dsi.unimi.it
permit user root port console
permit user root port ttyp1
deny                    # anything else

frissell@panix.com says:
Anyone who wants a book like "Codebreakers" should employ someone who does
OP (out of print) book searches. You give them the title you want, they
get back to you with a quote.  I got my copy of Codebreakers via Leo
Lowenthal (201) 328-7196 (if he hasn't retired) for quite a reasonable
price.

albinali@news.cs.columbia.edu says:
Anyone who wants to order "Codebreakers" should contact the publisher
(Macmillan Publishing Co.) and just order it from them. Their phone
number in the USA is 800-257-5755. I got it in under a week. It cost
me US$60.

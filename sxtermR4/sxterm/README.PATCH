To partially protect from the over-simple XHack of keyboard monitoring, undr this patch keyboard is secured when password is typed.

This tiny patch will scan for the password prompt.  When such arrives,
xterm will kick into "secure Keyboard" mode.  The search string can be
modified outside the code (resource pwdPrompt).


If you get the error
"ld: Undefined symbol
    _strncasecmp
 *** Error code 1" or if basically you machine has stricmp() instead - replace
it.


There is a loop in screen.c that handles the case of keyboard cannot
be grabbed.  This loop attempts to grab it 4 more times with a delay
of 3 seconds between them.  After that period it just continues
without blockking the keyboard.  These values (4 times with sleeps of
3 secs) are completely arbitrary - maybe they should have been
command-line-modifiable ... oh well ...

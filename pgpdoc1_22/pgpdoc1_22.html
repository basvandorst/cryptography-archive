<HR>
<H3>Revoking a public key</H3>
<P>Suppose your secret key and your pass phrase are somehow both
compromised.  You have to get the word out to the rest of the world,
so that they will all stop using your public key.  To do this, you
will have to issue a <I>key compromise</I>, or <I>key revocation</I>
certificate to revoke your public key.
<P>To generate a certificate to revoke your own key, use the <KBD>-kd</KBD>
command:
<PRE>
     pgp -kd your_userid
</PRE>
This certificate bears your signature, made with the same key you are
revoking.  You should widely disseminate this key revocation
certificate as soon as possible.  Other people who receive it can add
it to their public key rings, and their PGP software then
automatically prevents them from accidentally using your old public
key ever again.  You can then generate a new secret/public key pair
and publish the new public key.
<P>You may choose to revoke your key for some other reason than the
compromise of a secret key.  If so, you may still use the same
mechanism to revoke it.

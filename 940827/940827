This still gives the "You are not listed as a recipient in this message."
error when decrypting messages from Ripem Mac in PEM format with
certificates.

In addition, it's not clear how to set up the preferences file in the Unix
version.

Although my public key carries an RSADSI Persona certificate, as well as
being self-signed, I get the following from 2.0b1:

The selected user is:
  CN = strnlght@netcom.com, OU = Persona Certificate, O = RSA Data Security, 
Inc., C = US
This is your own self-signed certificate.
It has a certificate status of REVOCATION UNKNOWN
  with a validity period from 04/20/94 to 04/19/96 GMT.

Why isn't it VALID instead of REVOCATION UNKNOWN, and how do I fix it?

David

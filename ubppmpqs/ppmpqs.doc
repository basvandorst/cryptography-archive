PPMPQS.DOC

  PPMPQS is a prime factorization program for the numbers of 
over 40 digits(especially for over 80 digits).  The method is 
the double large primes procedure variation of the multiple 
polynomial quadratic sieve.

* Notice
  PPMPQS is the last resort to factor big integers.  It's very wasteful
to use PPMPQS from the first stage.  Try to remove the small factors 
beforehand.  At least use rho method(=Monte Carlo method) for a few hours.

* Warning!! 

  This pogram is very dangerous because this program uses heavily 
                      ---------
the 386 protect mode machine codes in a non standard manner.
Do not run if your machine does not have 386CPU or extended memories.
Run under the native DOS without adding any accessories such as
EMM386, QEMM, SMARTDRV, etc.  It does not run on Windows DOS-BOX, OS/2
nor Windows/NT.
  For DOS5, DOS=HIGH is allowed, but UMB is not allowed and also EMM386 
and SMARTDRV are not allowed.  Please check your CONFIG.SYS and 
AUTOEXEC.BAT files.  DOSsetup program installs some of them automatically.
Please remove them if any.

  Recommended CONFIG.SYS is:

    BUFFERS = 20
    FILES = 20

without any other term.

  Recommended AUTOEXEC.BAT is the empty file.


* Machine spec

  CPU    : 80386(SX,DX),80486(SX,DX),...
  MEMORY : 640Mbytes main
           + extended memory(=protected mode memory)
             1Mbytes for <= 70 digits
             2Mbytes for  80 digits
             4Mbytes for  90 digits
             6Mbytes for 100 digits

  HDD    :   5Mbytes for <= 70 digits
            15Mbytes for  80 digits
            45Mbytes for  90 digits
           120Mbytes for 100 digits

  CPUTIME :  4hours for  60 digits
            40hours for  70 digits
           360hours for  80 digits
          3400hours for  90 digits
         32000hours for 100 digits
         (using 80386SX-16MHz)


* Notice
  You cannot use FREEZE-MELT.


* Break and restart PPMP2.

  It takes over 2 weeks for the factorization of the numbers of
 over 80 digits.  You must break and restart the program many times.
 But you cannot use FREEZE-MELT because these programs run in the
 protected mode.  Do as follows:

 Break
 1) Break PPMP2 by pressing CTRL+C repeatedly.
 2) Return to MS-DOS by SYSTEM.

 Restart

1) Run PPMP2

* Parallel processing by many machines

  You can separate the work into many parts running on independent
machines.

1) Run PPMP1 on the host machine and return to MS-DOS.

2) Copy PPMPDATA.UBD into many floppy disks of the satellite machines.
   Also copy the following files:
      UBIBM32.EXE
      UBCONST7.DATA
      PPMP2.UB
      PPMP2.UBB
      PPMP2P.UBB

3) Run PPMP2 on the host and the satellites.

4) When a floppy disk of a satellite becomes almost full, do 'print done' 
   and memo the result.  This value means you have just got the data of 
   this quantity.
   Return to MS-DOS and Repeat from 2) with a new floppy disk. 

5) If the total of these data exceeds the 'FB size' then the sieving 
   is finished.  Do the following:
    a) Break the host and run "PPMP2A".
    b) Select 'Read data' in the MENU.
    c) Read all the fllopy disks made by the satellites.
    d) Run "PPMP3A"

* Using 2 HDDs in PPMP4B, PPMP5 and PPMP6.

  You can use 2 HDDs for the matrix files.
  Rewrite  Drv1%,SZ1,Drv2%,SZ2 at the top of PPMP4A.

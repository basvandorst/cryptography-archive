<H2>Physical security breach</H2>
<P>A physical security breach may allow someone to physically acquire
your plaintext files or printed messages.  A determined opponent
might accomplish this through burglary, trash-picking, unreasonable
search and seizure, or bribery, blackmail or infiltration of your
staff.  Some of these attacks may be especially feasible against
grassroots political organizations that depend on a largely volunteer
staff.  It has been widely reported in the press that the FBI's
COINTELPRO program used burglary, infiltration, and illegal bugging
against antiwar and civil rights groups.  And look what happened at
the Watergate Hotel.  
<P>Don't be lulled into a false sense of security just because you have
a cryptographic tool.  Cryptographic techniques protect data only
while it's encrypted -- direct physical security violations can still
compromise plaintext data or written or spoken information.  
<P>This kind of attack is cheaper than cryptanalytic attacks on PGP.

The Freedom Remailer's features were inspired by those contained in Matt
Ghio's remailer but it was written independently and with no code
borrowing, excepting the statistics code which was pretty much outright
copied with few changes.  All credit for the statistics code is given to
Matthew Ghio (mg5n+@cmu.edu).

It supports Type I (Cypherpunks) message remailing.  Its features include:
 * anonymous remailing, recognizing a variety of remailing headers
 * PGP support
 * Hashmark Header Pasting
 * Double-Colon extra-header recognition
 * sends help, pgp key, and statistics on request
 * source, destination, and subject blocking
 * Anonymous posting to usenet
 * ignores messages remailed to "null"
 * Cutmarks: header
 * Encrypt-Key: header
 * Latent-Time: header

For information on compiling and installation, see the file "INSTALLATION"
provided with this distribution. 

The Freedom Remailer was developed under Linux.  However, it is also known
to run under SunOS and Ultrix.  If you get it working elsewhere, please
let me know; if it required patches, please submit them to me.

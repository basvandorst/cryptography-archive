Compilation & Installation of the Freedom Remailer
--------------------------------------------------

1. Take a look at the Makefile.  Change the values of CC, STRIP, CFLAGS,
   and LFLAGS according to your system if you need to.

2. Take a look at config.h.  You *will* have to change this file.  Below
   is a description of what each definition means:

USE_STATS
	This option will enable the statistics-keeping in the remailer.
	If you are running this remailer as the Type I remailer under
	Mixmaster, this is unnecessary since Mixmaster keeps its own stats.
	Set to YES if you want it, NO if you do not.
ALLOW_POST
	Define this if you want your remailer to be able to post anonymously
	to Usenet.  Set to YES if you want it, NO if you do not.
USE_PGP
	Define this if you have PGP support.  This will enable messages
	encrypted for the remailer to be decrypted and will enable
	the Encrypt-Key header.  Set to YES if you want it, NO if you do not.
DEBUG
	Define this if you want the remailer to spit comments about what it
	is doing to stdout.  I used this to watch it as it ran; you probably
	want to set it to NO.

REMAILER_DIR	The base directory of your remailer installation
QUEUE_DIR	The directory to use to hold queued latent messages
PGP_DIR		The directory where your remailer's PGP keyrings are stored
MAIL_SPOOL	The mail spool or log file where you want non-anonymous mail
		to be dumped
SENDMAIL	The path to your sendmail program
PGP		The path to your PGP program
INEWS		The path to your inews program
PASS_PHRASE	The PGP pass phrase for your remailer's secret key
HELP_FILE	The name of the helpfile that resides in REMAILER_DIR that
		describes the use of this remailer
STATS_FILE	The name of the statistics file that resides in REMAILER_DIR
COUNT_FILE	The name of the count file that resides in REMAILER_DIR
		(currently unused)
SOURCE_BLOCK	The name of the file that contains addresses from whom
		anonymous mail should not be accepted
DEST_BLOCK	The name of the file that contains addresses to whom
		anonymous mail should not be sent
SUBJ_BLOCK	The name of the file that contains subjects/partial
		subjects that you want to block
PGP_KEY_FILE	The file containing your remailer's PGP public key
REMAILER_NAME	The "long name" of your remailer
REMAILER_ADDR	The e-mail address of your remailer
(mail from your remailer will say:  From: REMAILER_NAME <REMAILER_ADDR>)
COMPLAINTS_TO	The e-mail address you want complaints about your remailer to
		be sent to
ORGANIZATION	What to put in the Organization: line on anonymous usenet
		posts

3. Type 'make'  This should build a program called "remailer".

4. Make sure that all the files and paths you defined in config.h exist and
   are where you said they would be.  If you listed any directories that
   do not exist, create them.

5. Create a file called ".forward" in your home directory that contains a line
   like:
"|/users/me/freedom/remailer"
   where, obviously, you substitute the full path to the remailer program you
   just built.

   You can direct output of remailer to a file if you want.  There
   shouldn't be any output except possibly from PGP unless you defined
   DEBUG to YES, in which case the remailer will print some stuff.  
   To do this, you can put something like:
"|/users/me/freedom/remailer >> /users/me/remailer.messages"
   in your .forward file.

6. Create a PGP key for your remailer (pgp -kg) if you have not done so
   already.  Be sure to use the same pass phrase you compiled into the
   remailer.  Extract the key into an ascii file with whatever name you
   put in PGP_KEY_FILE so it can be mailed to those who request it.

7. Modify the help file as you see fit, add addresses/subjects to the block 
   files, etc.  If blocking is acting problematically, (ie it is blocking
   EVERY message) make sure there are no blank lines in the blockfiles.

8. The remailer will run the latent message queue every time it is run.
   However, in case traffic is low, you might want to have cron run the
   queue every once in a while (perhaps every ten minutes).  To just run
   the latent message queue, you invoke "remailer" with the "-q" option.
   A sample crontab entry to run the latent message queue every 10 minutes
   looks like:
	10,20,30,40,50,0 * * * *        /your/directory/remailer -q

9. Run some tests.

10. Hopefully it passed the tests.  Yahoo.  You have a remailer.

If you encounter any problems in installation or operation or you have any
other comments or questions on this piece of software, please send them to

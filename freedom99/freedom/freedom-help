This message is being sent to you automatically in response to the message
you sent to this remailer with the subject "remailer-help".

There is an automated mail handling program installed on this account
which will take any message with the proper headers and automatically
re-send it anonymously.  

You can use this by sending a message to remailer@wherever, with the header
Anon-To: <address>, the address that you want to send anonymously to.
(Only one recipient address is permitted.) If you can't add headers to
your mail, you can place two colons on the first line of your message,
followed by the Anon-To line.  Follow that with a blank line, and then
begin your message. For Example: 

> From: joe@site.com
> To: remailer@wherever
> Subject: Anonymous Mail
>
> ::
> Anon-To: beth@univ.edu
>
> This is some anonymous mail.

The above would be delivered to beth@univ.edu anonymously.  All headers in
the original message are removed.  She would not know that it came from
Joe, nor would she be able to reply to the message.  However, there are a
few ways that the true identity of the sender could be found.  First, if
many anonymous messages were sent, someone could compare the times that
the messages were sent with the times that 'joe' was logged in.  However,
this can be prevented by instructing the remailer to delay the message, by
using the Latent-Time header: 

> From: joe@site.com
> To: remailer@wherever
> Subject: Anonymous Mail
>
> ::
> Anon-To: beth@univ.edu
> Latent-Time: +1:00
>
> This is some anonymous mail.

The message would be delayed one hour from when it is sent.  It is also
possible to create a random delay by adding an r to the time (ie +1:00r),
which would have the message be delivered at a random time, but not more
than an hour.  It is also possible to delay the message until a specific
time.  For example, "Latent-Time: 18:00" would delay the message until 6 PM,
Pacific Daylight Time.  Times must be in 24-hour format.

Another problem is that some mailers automatically insert a signature file.
Of course, this usually contains the senders email address, and so would
reveal their identity.  The remailer software can be instructed to remove
a signature file with the header "Cutmarks".  Any line beginning with the
same text at in the cutmarks header, and any lines following it will be
removed.

> From: sender@origin.com
> To: remailer@wherever
> Subject: Anonymous Mail
>
> ::
> Anon-To: recipient@destination.com
> Cutmarks: --
>
> This line of text will be in the anonymous message.
> --
> This line of text will not be in the anonymous message.

The remailer can also be used to make posts to usenet.  To do this, use
Anon-Post-To.

> From: poster@origin.com
> To: remailer@wherever
> Subject: Anonymous Post
>
> ::
> Anon-Post-To: alt.test
>
> This is an anonymous message

You can add additional headers to the output message by preceding them
with ##.  In fact, you MUST use this to add a subject header to anonymous
posts since the remailer strips all original headers and usenet posts will
not be accepted without a Subject: header. 

> From: chris@nifty.org
> To: remailer@wherever
> Subject: Nifty Anon Msg
>
> ::
> Anon-To: andrew@where-ever.org
>
> ##
> Subject: Hi there!
>
> A Message with a pasted-in header.

By separating messages with cutmarks, you can send more than one message
at once: 

> From: me@mysite
> To: remailer@wherever
> Subject: whatever
>
> ::
> Anon-To: recipient1@site1.org
> Cutmarks: --
> 
> ##
> Subject: message 1
> 
> Message one.
> --
> ::
> Anon-To: recipient2@site2.org
> 
> ##
> Subject: message 2
> 
> Message two.

The two messages will be delivered separately. 

For added security, you can encrypt your messages to the remailer with
PGP. The remailer software will decrypt the message and send it on.  Here
is the remailer's public key: 

-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----

put your key here

-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----

To utilize this feature, create a message with two colons on the first
line, then any other headers such as cutmarks or latency, then the
Anon-To: or Anon-Post-To: header, then a blank line, and then the message. 
Encrypt this with the remailer's public key.  Then send it to the
remailer, adding the header "Encrypted: PGP". If you forget this, the
remailer won't know that it needs to be decrypted. 

> To: remailer@wherever
> From: me@mysite.org

> Encrypted: PGP

> -----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----

> =da+F
> -----END PGP MESSAGE-----

Any unencrypted text after the PGP message is also remailed.  This is to
allow sending to someone who is anonymous.  If you create a PGP-encrypted
message to yourself via this remailer, and then you give it to someone,
they can send you a message by sending the encrypted message to the
remailer.  The remailer will then decrypt it and send it to you.  The
message gets anonymized in the process, so the sender will need to include
a return address if he wants a reply. 

Messages sent this way can be encrypted using the Encrypt-Key: feature.
Any text following a line beginning with ** will be encrypted with this
key.  For example, if you put in your PGP message:

> ::
> Anon-To: you@yourhost.org
> Encrypt-Key: your_password
> 
> **

The appended message after the ** will be encrypted with the key 
"your_password", using PGP's conventional encryption option.  

Abuse Policy:
I consider the following to be inappropriate use of this anonymous remailer,
and will take steps to prevent anyone from doing any of the following:
- Sending messages intended primarily to be harassing or annoying.
- Use of the remailer for any illegal purpose.
- Spamming

If you don't want to receive anonymous mail, send email to
remailer-admin@wherever, and you will be added to the block list.

Change Log for the Freedom Remailer

Version 0.99.1b:
Changes since version 0.99b:
* retslower() removed.  it was horrid.  program now gets further before
  memory faulting
* scan_message returns NON_ANON if the message can't be opened.  this is
  because when processing cutmarks leftovers, there IS no message in that
  file.  As long as trimmings is checked before NON_ANON in remailer.c
  (it is) this fixes it.  This did not mess up on Linux, but caused seg.
  faults on other systems.  Those should be solved now.
* README updated
* TODO updated

Version 0.99b:
Changes since version 0.98b:
* setenv() and unsetenv() calls replaced by putenv()

Version 0.98b:
Changes since version 0.97b:
* decent help file added to distribution
* some debugging info can be turned on at compile-time
* #ifdefs removed and replaced with if (...) 's
* scan_message changed so the anon-to: header does not have to come last
* help file rewritten to reflect changes in the header processing
* README and INSTALLATION updated

Version 0.97b
Changes since version 0.96b:
* Subject blocking added.
* Bug fix version?  Kinda.  Mostly changed the way certain things are done
  so that they are more versatile and avoid problems if someone does
  something wrong:
* the way Cutmarks: and Encrypt-Key: headers are stripped was changed so
  that it is not case-sensitive, causing infinite loops if the user does
  not type them in the proper case. A stupid problem that I knew of when
  I wrote the code but did not feel like fixing.  Its time for fixing has
  come.
* Changed usage of strstr() to strncmp() when looking for headers in
  scan_message.  Probably doesn't matter practically, but seems more
  correct.
* Stupid bug that was documented in the README (up until this point) that
  made it impossible to use uppercase in encrypt-keys and cutmarks was
  finally fixed.
* There was a stupid bug that caused the remailer to leave out the first
  line of mail it was dumping to spool.  Fixed.
* took out all the extraneous printf's I was using for debugging
* added some #defines in config.h and #ifdefs in remailer.c files to
  enable/disable posting, pgp support, and statistics-keeping
* Typo in CHANGES (this file) that said queue could be run by giving
  "-r" when in fact the argument is "-q".  Changed.
* README updated in a few places
* INSTALLATION file updated
* TODO updated
* Makefile changed a bit

Version 0.96b
Changes since version 0.95b:
* bugfix! was reusing cfilename for encrypt-key so if there were more
  cutmarks to process after encrypt-key was used, all was lost; now
  a new tempfile is used for encrypt-key

Version 0.95b
Changes since verson 0.94b:
* now supports Encrypt-Key: header

Version 0.94b
Changes since version 0.93b:
* now queues messages with latent-time header, recognizing XX:XX,
  +XX:XX, and +XX:XXR
* runs latent message queue each time it is run, after recursion is done
* ONLY runs latent message queue if called with argument -q

Version 0.93b
Changes since version 0.92b:
* now mails remailer's key if subject remailer-key is received
* now dumps mail sent anonymous to "null"

Version 0.92b
++ First betatesting version
Changes since verson 0.91:
* GNU public license added
* README, INSTALL, TODO, CHANGES (duh) updated appropriately
* Source files updated to include pointer to the GNU public license

Version 0.91
Changes since version 0.9:
* added support for x-anon-to: and anon-send-to:
* added Organization: line to usenet postings
* added updatestats(STATS_MESSAGE) to usenet postings, at least until I
  modify stats to keep usenet stats separately
* somehow I missed the line in mailstats() that showed how many messages
  were queued with latency.  I added it back.

Version 0.9
Changes since version 0.8:
* <string.h> added to remailer.c  Oops!
* support for cutmarks: header added

Version 0.81
Changes since version 0.8:
* :: headers handled differently & more properly.  they are only considered
  if the :: appears on the first line of the body of the message.
* code to separate headers, remove the first :: header, and paste ## headers
  rewritten but has the same functionality

Version 0.8
Changes since version 0.71:
* support for remail-to: header added
* pgp messages handled differently; now, any unencrypted text after the pgp
  message is also remailed, whereas before, only the unencrypted pgp message
  was remailed

Version 0.71
Changes since version 0.7:
* made remailer check for anon-post-to in real headers as well a :: headers
  silly oversight the first time around
* made remailer only cut out the first :: header to allow chains
* made remailer paste in the ## headers only if last in chain
(I'm half-surprised the damn thing still works at this point)

Changes since version 0.6:
* usenet posting added via anon-post-to: header

Version 0.6
Changes since version 0.5:
* source blocking added
* destination blocking added

Version 0.5
Changes since version 0.4:

* fixed bug in mailstats() which printed *'s to stdout instead of pipe
* mailstats() now puts a To: header in, just for looks
* added INSTALL and README file to distribution (in anticipation of release)

Version 0.4
Changes since version 0.3:
* PGP support added
* Stats code reformatted

Version 0.3
Changes since version 0.2:
* statistics code added
* now mails statistics if sent a message with Subject: remailer-stats

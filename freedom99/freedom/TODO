TODO + 6/8/95 + jfleming@indiana.edu
-------------------------------------

Little things I'd like to change:
* do checking on file-opens so it won't bomb if certain files don't exist
  (although they SHOULD exist if the operator put them in the right place)
* comment the code enough so that people other than me can follow my thoughts
  (and thus, correct how they are flawed *smile*)
* write my own statistics code, and have it keep track of usenet postings
  and help & stats requests as well as the other stuff (I think I've
  decided against doing this.  I really don't think it's necessary).

 INTRO

  MPI.EXE is freeware!

  MPI.EXE provides a menu driven interface for dos based offline mail
readers to  use pgp.  It saves having to remember the various pgp
command line  options, and provides for selecting which keys to use,
from a a list of the keys on your keyrings.  MPI may be used with any
mail reader that supports an external editor, or spell checker.

  The distribution should include the following files ...
MPI.EXE     - the program (obvious eh?)
MPI.DOC     - take a wild guess!<g>
MPI.SIG     - The pgp signature of MPI.EXE, made using keyid 0x9E670369
HODGINS.ASC - My pgp public key, which when added to your keyring, should
              show a valid signature from Peter Gutmann <pgut1@cs.aukuni.ac.nz>,
              whose key is included with the pgp distribution files.


  INSTALLATION

  First add my key to your public keyring using ...

PGP HODGINS.ASC

  If the signature from Peter is not present, or invalid, you may get a copy
of my public key from any of the public pgp key servers, or directly from me.
(See below for how to contact me).

  Check the signature on the exe file using
PGP MPI.SIG
and entering MPI.EXE when prompted.

  If the signature doesn't show as valid, contact me directly for a good copy.

  Copy MPI.EXE to a directory on your path.

  If you're going to execute mpi in place of a spell checker, set up your
reader to execute mpi.exe, passing the name of the message file as the
first (and only) parameter.  If you want to still be able to use an external
spell checker, create a file called spellchk.bat, and put it in the same
directory as mpi.exe.  When selected, the batch file will be executed,
passing the name of the message file, as the first parameter.  Note that
the batch file name must be spellchk.bat, and must be located in the same
directory as mpi.exe, or the option will not be displayed on the mpi
menu.

  If you're going to use the option for an external editor, create a
batch file that executes the external editor of your choice, followed by
mpi, making sure that the parm passed to mpi is the message file.

  The options on the main menu are pretty self explanatory.  Help is available
on the various selection screens, by pressing the f1 key.

  NOTES

  The environment variable PGPPATH must be set, so mpi.exe can find your
key rings.  MPI will look the the directories in your path, and in the
directory pointed to by PGPPATH, for PGP.EXE.

  If the message file does not exist, or is empty, only the options to
post a key, or append a file will be shown.

  I'd like to thank John Schofield for writing ez-pgp, which I used until
I switched to windows 95.  When ez-pgp wouldn't work under 95, I decided
to write my own interface, and decided this would be a good project to
teach myself c.  As this is my first c program, the code is rather messy,
so I'm not including it in this distribution.  I will send a copy to
anyone who'd like to check it out.

   Of course I'd also like to thank Phil Zimmermann, and all of the people
involved in creating/distributing pgp.

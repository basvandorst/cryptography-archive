README File for the Multiprecision Package and Translator Papers

Update as of May 26, 1993

The following files are included in the "shar" file accompanying this file:

Name            Description

mpfun.tex       LaTeX source for the MP package technical paper
transmp.tex     LaTeX source for the MP translator technical paper

Most users rely on the translator exclusively and do not write code
that directly calls the mpfun routines.  Such users do not need to
read the mpfun paper.  Assuming LaTeX and Postscript software has been
installed, a typical Unix sequence to process the transmp paper is

latex transmp
latex transmp
dvips -o transmp.ps transmp.dvi
lpr transmp.ps

As you can see from this sequence, latex must be run twice.  The
second run resolves bibliographic references from the first.

If you wish to cite one of my papers as a reference, I ask that the
following be cited, which is a combination and condensation of the
mpfun and transmp papers:

D. H. Bailey, "Multiprecision Translation and Execution of Fortran
Programs", ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software, to appear.

If you do get some results and write them up, I would appreciate a
copy of your paper, or at least a brief note describing what you did.
This helps me sell my efforts in this area to NASA management.

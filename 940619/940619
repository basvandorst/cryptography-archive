Subject: certification terminology


I'm getting pretty far along in the cert chain code for RIPEM and need
some advice on terminology that the user will see.

To go beyond direct trust, you must tell RIPEM that a user you have
certified may certify another through a chain of N certs.  For
example, if I only trust you to directly certify other people, I set
your "certify extent" to 1.  I might trust chains from the Low
Assurance PCA to be plenty long, so I might set its "certify extent" to
6.  The default is zero unless otherwise specified - that is, I don't
trust this person to certify others, I trust only them directly.

This term "certify extent" is what I'm asking about.  Does it sound
good to say "You can set someone's certify extent to 1 if they may
certify one other person" ?  Perhaps "certification authorization
extent" is more clear but this is too long.  Ideas?

Certification chain length.

By the way, you don't want to set the LAPCA to 6. You don't know anything
about the certification policies of its users.

You might want to set the chain length of the IPRA to 3, though, since they
only certify certifiers, who in turn certify individuals.

There is the problem of conflicting lengths. Thus you might set IPRA=3, but
know that RSA, who is certified by IPRA, has a high-assurance authority that
certifies, say, IBM, who issues its own certificates. In such a case IBM
might be 1. This would mean the chain from IPRA to IBM would be 4, not 3.
Thus any conflicts should be resolved in favor of the higher number ON THAT
PATH, and you need to check down (actually up) the specific path in each
case.

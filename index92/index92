`` Immunizing Public Key Cryptosystems
   against Chosen Ciphertext Attacks''
 
Abstract
This paper presents three methods for strengthening public key
cryptosystems in such a way that they become secure against
{\em adaptively\/} chosen ciphertext attacks.  In an adaptively
chosen ciphertext attack, an attacker can query the deciphering
algorithm with any ciphertexts, {\em except\/} for the exact
object ciphertext to be cryptanalyzed.  The first strengthening
method is based on the use of one-way hash functions, the second
on the use of universal hash functions and the third on the use
of digital signature schemes. Each method is illustrated by an
example of a public key cryptosystem based on the intractability
of computing discrete logarithms in finite fields. Security of
the three example cryptosystems is formally proved. Two other
issues, namely applications of the methods to public key
cryptosystems based on other intractable problems and enhancement
of information authentication capability to the cryptosystems,
are also discussed.

OVERVIEW
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

   Offline AutoPGP is a fully automatic e-mail encryption package for use with
   PGP and an offline mail reader. It enables you to write encrypted messages
   and read decrypted messages from within your favourite mail reader, using
   the highly secure and widely acclaimed Pretty Good Privacy software package
   originally written by Phil Zimmermann - the new standard in public key
   encryption. AutoPGP combines the ease and comfort of reading and writing
   e-mail in an offliner with the security of public key encryption. You don't
   need any previous experience with PGP or any other encryption software, as
   AutoPGP will handle all interfacing with PGP automatically. If you are
   already familiar with the concepts of offline mail reading, you will soon
   get acquainted to AutoPGP, even if you have never used PGP before.

   Features of AutoPGP v2.10 include:

   ş Support for all the most popular mail readers. You may use AutoPGP with
     any mail reader that conforms to the QWK or SOUP specifications. Readers
     that use PCBoard and MBBS capture files (e.g. XBoard and Offliner) are
     also supported. In addition, you may use AutoPGP on ordinary ASCII-files.

   ş Easy installation. An intuitive, easy-to-use installation program will
     configure AutoPGP correctly for the first-time user. The installation
     program will automatically detect many popular offline readers, and
     configure AutoPGP for use with these readers. It will also find the
     correct paths to PkZip, Arj, Lha and PGP, set DOS environment variables
     and update your AUTOEXEC.BAT file if necessary.

   ş Support for the latest PGP versions. AutoPGP has been successfully tested
     with PGP 2.3a, 2.6, 2.6ui and 2.6n, and will probably work well with all
     PGP 2.x versions except 2.5 (the MIT beta-release). AutoPGP lets you read
     messages created with any 2.x version of PGP, even if you are using PGP
     2.3a after September 1, 1994.

   ş Automatic, seamless operation. When correctly set up, AutoPGP will
     automatically decrypt, encrypt and sign messages, verify signatures and
     add new public keys to your public key ring, all with a minimum of
     interaction from the user.

   ş Advanced functions not found in any other PGP front-end utility. AutoPGP
     lets you:

     o  encrypt a message to multiple recipients
     o  encrypt and/or sign only part(s) of a message
     o  insert your own or other users' public keys anywhere in a message
     o  include PGP ASCII armoured files in a message
     o  decrypt incoming messages
     o  verify signatures on incoming messages
     o  add new public keys found in incoming messages to your keyring
     o  extract PGP ASCII armoured files from incoming messages
     o  choose which public keys to use from an alphabetic list of userids
     o  and much more!

Limited licence 

   Offline AutoPGP is distributed under the ShareWare principles. This program
   is not free. You are granted a limited licence to evaluate AutoPGP for a
   period not to exceed 30 days. After 30 days, you must either pay for and
   register your copy of AutoPGP, or immediately discontinue its use and remove
   it from your computer.

   You are also granted the right to share AutoPGP with other users (and in
   fact encouraged to do so). You may freely copy AutoPGP, give it to friends
   and upload it to BBSes, as long as the following conditions are met:

   1) All the files in the original distribution archive APGP210.ZIP are
      distributed together.
   2) The files are not modified in any way.
   3) No fee is charged for copying and distribution other than a minimal fee
      covering the cost of the copying medium.
   4) REGISTERED USERS MAY NOT DISTRIBUTE THE SEPARATE REGISTRATION
      CERTIFICATE FILE AUTOPGP.REG.

   Also note that AutoPGP makes use of a number of external programs, such as
   PGP, PkZip and others, some of which may require separate licensing in order
   to use legally. It is in your own interest to make sure that you are not
   infringing any patents or copyrights by using these programs, even if they
   are required by AutoPGP for proper functioning. In particular, you should
   notice that the use of PGP may be restricted or even prohibited in some
   countries. The RSA algorithm employed by PGP is patented by a California
   company called Public Key Partners (U.S. patent #4,405,829), and you may be
   infringing this patent if you use PGP v2.3a or earlier in the USA.



Registering Offline AutoPGP

   You are encouraged to try the program for up to 30 days to determine if it
   meets your needs. If you want to continue using AutoPGP after this time, you
   will have to register it. You will then receive a registration certificate,
   a special key file, with your name and registration number. This certificate
   is signed with the author's public key, and thus cannot be forged. Only
   those who have a valid registration certificate will be able to use AutoPGP
   after the evaluation period has expired.

   IF YOU DO NOT REGISTER AutoPGP AT THE END OF THE EVALUATION PERIOD, IT WILL
   CEASE TO WORK. YOU ARE ALSO OBLIGATED TO DELETE ALL COPIES OF AutoPGP FROM
   YOUR SYSTEM AND NEVER USE IT AGAIN.

   To register AutoPGP, run the program REGISTER.EXE and follow the
   instructions. The registering fee is currently only US $10 (or NOK 80,
   whichever is most convenient). Preferred modes of payment are: credit cards
   (Visa, AmEx), US cash or international postal money order (in that order).
   But please do not send cheques, US money orders or other forms of payment
   that are not valid in Norway. When we have received your payment, we will
   issue a registration certificate and send it to your e-mail address. If you
   do not nave an e-mail address and want to register by snail mail, please add
   $5 for postage and diskette costs.

   As a registered user, you receive the following benefits:

   ş The right to use your copy of AutoPGP for an unlimited period of time.
   ş No more nagging ShareWare reminder notices.
   ş Free upgrades to all future versions of AutoPGP.
   ş Personal e-mail support. See 'Bug reports and technical support' below
     on how to contact the author.

   A large amount of work has gone into the development of AutoPGP, and the
   program is constantly improving. By registering AutoPGP, you help supporting
   further developments and enhancements of the program. Later versions will
   have new functions and support for more offline readers, but this depends
   on how many will register the program.



SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

Hardware requirements

   AutoPGP will run on any 80x86 compatible PC with at least 450K bytes of
   available conventional memory (approx. 180 Kb for AutoPGP + 270 Kb for
   PGP.EXE). You will also need a hard disk with enough space for all the files
   needed to run AutoPGP (see below), as well as the temporary workspace needed
   by PkZip/Arj/Lha and PGP.


Software requirements

   In addition to the files included in the APGP210.ZIP archive, you need the
   following programs in order to be able to run AutoPGP on your computer:

   o MS-DOS, PC-DOS, NDOS, 4DOS or OS/2-DOS (almost any version will do)

   o One of the following PGP versions:
     - PGP v2.3a : distributed in the file PGP23A.ZIP
     - PGP v2.6  : distributed in the file PGP26.ZIP (USA only)
     - PGP v2.6ui: distributed in the file PGP26UIX.ZIP
     - PGP v2.6n : distributed in the file PGP26N.ZIP (Norway only)

   o An archiving/unarchiving program. Currently supported archivers are:
     - Pk(Un)Zip: latest version distributed in the file PKZ204G.EXE
     - Arj      : latest version distributed in the file ARJ241.EXE
     - Lha(rc)  : latest version distributed in the file LHA255.EXE

   o A communications program, such as Telix (TLX321*.ZIP)

   o An offline mail reader. AutoPGP will work with any mail reader that uses
     one of the following formats:
     - QWK  : RoboMail, 1st Reader, Speed Read, Blue Wave, OLX etc.
     - SOUP : Yarn, RoboMail 1.4+ etc.
     - ASCII: Almost all readers may use this format
     - PCBoard/MBBS capture file: XBoard and Offliner



HOW DOES AutoPGP WORK?
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

   AutoPGP is actually three different programs, all working together in order
   to make PGP e-mail encryption as easy and painless as possible:

   ş DECRYPT.EXE is to be run after you have collected your incoming e-mail
     and quit your communications program, but before you enter your mail
     reader. DECRYPT will unpack the mail file(s), decrypt any PGP messages
     to you and collect new public keys which will be added to your public key
     ring. It will also extract ASCII armoured files included in the messages.

   ş ENCRYPT.EXE is to be run after you have written your replies and quit
     your mail reader, but before you start your communications program.
     ENCRYPT will scan through your outgoing messages, searching for any
     AutoPGP directives instructing ENCRYPT to encrypt and sign messages, as
     well as to insert public keys and ASCII armoured files into the messages.

   ş <READER>.BAT is a small batch file which calls DECRYPT, your mail reader,
     and ENCRYPT in the correct order. (<READER> is the name of the mail
     reader you are currently using with AutoPGP.) Feel free to modify this
     file yourself, to suit your own needs. If you are using an offline reader
     with a built-in communications program (such as 1st Reader), or if you
     want to decrypt or encrypt a single message at a time, you may want to
     call DECRYPT and ENCRYPT from inside the reader program, rather than
     using <READER>.BAT. For example, if your mail reader stores replies in
     the file REPLY.TXT, then executing 'ENCRYPT.EXE REPLY.TXT' from your mail
     reader will encrypt your reply.



INSTALLING PGP
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

   Before you install AutoPGP, you must have both PGP and a mail reader
   installed on your hard disk. If you have not yet installed PGP, now is the
   right time to do it. Although we recommend that you read the full
   documentation and installation guidelines for PGP, here's a short list to
   get you started:

   1.  Unpack the PGP distribution archive (e.g. PGP26UIX.ZIP) on your
       harddisk, preferably in a separate directory (e.g. C:\PGP).

   2.  Set the PGPPATH and TZ environment variables in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file,
       using a text editor, such as EDIT. PGPPATH is the path in which your
       CONFIG.TXT, PUBRING.PGP and SECRING.PGP files will be found (e.g. SET
       PGPPATH=C:\PGP), whereas TZ ("time zone") ensures that MS-DOS gives you
       correct GMT timestamps, and will handle daylight savings time
       adjustments for you. Here are some sample lines to insert into
       AUTOEXEC.BAT, depending on your time zone:

       For Los Angeles:  SET TZ=PST8PDT
       For Denver:       SET TZ=MST7MDT
       For Arizona:      SET TZ=MST7
          (Arizona never uses daylight savings time)
       For Chicago:      SET TZ=CST6CDT
       For New York:     SET TZ=EST5EDT
       For London:       SET TZ=GMT0BST
       For Oslo:         SET TZ=CET-1DST
       For Moscow:       SET TZ=MSK-3MSD
       For Aukland:      SET TZ=NZT-13

       NOTE: If you do not set the PGPPATH and TZ environment variables when
       installing PGP, the AutoPGP installation program will prompt you for
       the correct settings for these variables. AutoPGP will not run unless
       both PGPPATH and TZ are set. If you are not sure about the correct TZ
       setting for your country, just use "GMT0" or the setting for a
       neighbouring country.

   2a. If you have a RAM disk installed on your system, you should also
       consider setting the TMP environment variable. Normally, PGP and
       AutoPGP will use the current directory for storing temporary files, but
       if the TMP variable is set, the directory specified here will be used
       instead. Setting TMP to point to a RAM disk will substantially reduce
       the time taken to encrypt and decrypt messages. For example, if your
       RAM disk is drive E:, you should add the following line to your
       AUTOEXEC.BAT:

       SET TMP=E:\

       If you don't have a RAM disk, set TMP to point to the fastest of your
       hard disks, and one which is not compressed with DoubleSpace, Stacker
       or another disk compression utility that may slow down the effective
       disk transfer rate.

   3.  Generate your own PGP key pair. This is done by entering "PGP -KG" on
       the command line, and following the instructions.

   4.  Start spreading your public key to other users. The easiest way to do
       this, is by using the [PGP MY KEY] directive with AutoPGP as described
       later in this manual. ENCRYPT will then automatically insert your
       public key into the message, and the recipient can later use your key
       to encrypt secret messages to you.

   5.  Read the PGP User's Guide! PGPDOC1.DOC should be compulsory reading for
       all users of PGP, whereas PGPDOC2.DOC is for more advanced users.



INSTALLING AutoPGP
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

   AutoPGP is extremely simple to install, provided that you have already
   installed a mail reader and that PGP is properly set up. All you have to do
   is to carry out these few steps:

   1. Unpack the file APGP210.ZIP using PkUnzip 2.x (which you have probably
      already done, since you are reading this file now).

   2. Run the batch file CHECKSIG.BAT to check the signature certificates of
      ENCRYPT.EXE, DECRYPT.EXE, INSTALL.EXE and REGISTER.EXE. If the signature
      check fails for any of the files, it could mean that they have been
      tampered with.

      IF THIS HAPPENS, DELETE ALL THE FILES FROM THE APGP210.ZIP ARCHIVE, AND
      TRY TO OBTAIN A NEW COPY FROM A DIFFERENT SOURCE. DO NOT INSTALL AutoPGP
      BEFORE YOU GET A VERSION WITH A GOOD SIGNATURE!

      In order to check the signatures, you will need the author's public key
      (keyid 0xFEB0FBDB). If you do not already have this key, CHECKSIG.BAT
      will extract it from the file KEY.ASC and add it to your public keyring.
      It is, however, strongly recommended to obtain this key from a source
      other than the distribution archive itself. If you have access to a
      public key server, send the command "GET 0xFEB0FBDB" to get the correct
      key.

   3. Place all the files contained in the distribution archive in the
      directory where you want AutoPGP to be (e.g. C:\PGP\APGP). If you are
      upgrading from an earlier version of AutoPGP, simply replace the old
      files with the new ones. Do not erase your old AUTOPGP.CFG file, as
      INSTALL.EXE will use this file when upgrading to version 2.10.
   
   4. Once all the files are copied to the correct directory, change to that
      directory and enter "INSTALL" on the command line. You will then be
      asked which mail reader you want to use with AutoPGP, which secret key
      to use for signing messages (in case you have more than one) and so on.
      Filling in the different fields should be pretty self-explanatory
      (INSTALL will fill in most of them for you), and you can abort the
      installation at any time by pressing ESC.

   When finished, INSTALL will create a configuration file, AUTOPGP.CFG, in
   your AutoPGP directory which you can later edit manually using a text
   editor. INSTALL will also create the batch file <READER>.BAT, where <READER>
   is the name of the mail reader currently set up for use with AutoPGP.
   AutoPGP is now installed on your system, and all you have to do is to enter
   '<READER>.BAT' on the command line to start your mail reader. If you are
   planning to use AutoPGP with more than one mail reader at a time, simply run
   INSTALL once again for each additional mail reader. You will then get one
   batch file for each mail reader.



HOW TO USE IT
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

   When you start <READER>.BAT, DECRYPT will first search through your incoming
   e-mail, decrypt any PGP messages to you, and (if you want to) add new public
   keys to your public key ring. The only thing you have to do, is entering
   your pass phrase and answering 'Y' or 'N' from time to time. When DECRYPT
   is finished, <READER>.BAT will start your mail reader, and you can read and
   write messages as usual. Entering messages within the reader is done exactly
   as you are used to, but in addition to ordinary text, you may include a
   number of special AutoPGP directives. When you quit your mail reader and
   <READER>.BAT calls ENCRYPT, these directives will be recognized by ENCRYPT,
   instructing it to encrypt and sign messages, or to insert public keys into
   the text.


AutoPGP directives

   AutoPGP directives must all be written in CAPITAL letters, and on separate
   lines with no leading spaces (trailing spaces are allowed). Otherwise,
   ENCRYPT will treat them as ordinary text. There are two reasons for this:
   (1) it speeds up the search algorithm employed by ENCRYPT, and (2) it
   enables you to include the directives within your text, e.g. when quoting
   messages, or when writing about how to use AutoPGP. Here is a list of valid
   directives in AutoPGP version 2.10:

   Directive                     Action

   [PGP ENCRYPT userid]          Instructs ENCRYPT to encrypt the following
                                 text block with the public key for the
                                 specified userid. If no userid is specified,
                                 ENCRYPT will take the name of the recipient
                                 of the message and use his/her public key
                                 instead. If the message is marked as
                                 'public', ENCRYPT will let you choose
                                 additional public keys, so that the message
                                 can be read by multiple recipients. 

   [PGP SIGN ARMOUR] or          Instruct ENCRYPT to sign the following text
   [PGP SIGN ARMOR]              block with your own secret key, using ASCII
                                 armour mode.

   [PGP SIGN CLEAR]              Instructs ENCRYPT to sign the following text
                                 block with your own secret key, using
                                 cleartext mode.

   [PGP SIGN]                    Defaults to either [PGP SIGN ARMOUR] or [PGP
                                 SIGN CLEAR] depending on the setting of the
                                 ClearSign variable in AUTOPGP.CFG.

   [PGP ENCRYPT userid SIGN] or  Instruct ENCRYPT to both encrypt and sign
   [PGP SIGN ENCRYPT userid]     the following text block. If no userid is
                                 specified, ENCRYPT will use the public key
                                 belonging to the recipient of the message.
                                 If the message is marked as 'public',
                                 ENCRYPT will let you choose additional
                                 public keys, so that the message can be read
                                 by multiple recipients. 

   [PGP ON]                      Defaults to either [PGP ENCRYPT SIGN] or
                                 [PGP SIGN] depending on whether the
                                 recipient of the message is a single person
                                 or ALL, respectively.

   [PGP OFF]                     Terminates the text block started with one
                                 of the above directives. If the whole
                                 message is to be signed and/or encrypted,
                                 this directive may be omitted, as it is
                                 automatically assumed at the end.

   [PGP KEY userid]              Inserts a public key into the message. If no
                                 userid is specified, ENCRYPT will prompt you
                                 for the correct key to insert.

   [PGP MY KEY]                  Inserts your own public key into the
                                 message.

   [PGP FILE filename]           Inserts a file into the message. The file
                                 may contain ASCII (text) or binary (program)
                                 information. It is neither encrypted nor
                                 signed (unless, of course, you place it
                                 inside a [PGP ENCRYPT]-block), but will be
                                 converted to PGP ASCII armour format,
                                 ensuring that no data is lost when
                                 transferred through e-mail channels. If the
                                 filename does not contain a path, ENCRYPT
                                 will look for the file in the upload
                                 directory specified in AUTOPGP.CFG.

   NOTE: The userid is the name of the person whose public key you want to use,
   consisting of as many characters as necessary to make it unambiguous. It
   does not have to be written in capital letters. For instance, if you want
   to include John Q. Smith's public key in your message, you simply write
   '[PGP KEY john q]' on a separate line. If you want to specify a key id
   rather than a user name, you should use the '0x' prefix, e.g. '[PGP KEY
   0xfeb0]'. If the specified userid is ambiguous, then ENCRYPT will prompt you
   for the correct public key to use.


Sample messages

   Here are two examples of what a message might look like, as seen inside your
   mail reader's text editor. Notice that all AutoPGP directives are written
   on separate lines, and that they can be referred to inside the message text
   without confusing ENCRYPT:

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------

   Dave,

   [PGP ON]

   Just checking if AutoPGP really works the way it should. It's quite simple
   to use, just add '[PGP ON]' at the beginning of the part that is to be
   encrypted, and AutoPGP will do all the work for you. Since the rest of this
   message is encrypted, I don't even have to include the directive '[PGP OFF]'
   at the end. 

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------

   Hi, Paul!

   Here is the public key you asked for:

   [PGP ENCRYPT SIGN]
   This text block is encrypted, in order to ensure that the public key has not
   been tampered with. Here it is:

   [PGP KEY Robert]

   The key was handed to me personally, so I have certified it and can
   guarantee that it is genuine.

   I also include a small program I wrote which might interest you:

   [PGP FILE C:\PASCAL\MYPROG.EXE]

   Please don't give it to other users, as I am not yet finished with it.
   [PGP OFF]

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------



CONFIGURING AutoPGP
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

   ENCRYPT and DECRYPT use a special configuration file, AUTOPGP.CFG, which 
   enables you to customize AutoPGP in various ways. If you perform an ordinary
   installation of AutoPGP as described in 'INSTALLING AutoPGP' above, you will
   normally not have to worry about the settings in AUTOPGP.CFG, as they will
   be set automatically the first time you run INSTALL. But if you have any
   special preferences as to how AutoPGP should be set up, you may find this
   configuration file useful. Here you can specify the values of a number of
   AutoPGP system variables. All assignments take the form <variable> =
   <value>, and all variables are case insensitive. Lines that start with '#'
   are treated as comments.


   Variable         Value

   MyName,          Your name and address. In version 2.10, these are only
   MyAddress and    used when registering AutoPGP.
   MyTown

   MyCountry        Your country. If set to 'Norway' or 'Norge', AutoPGP will
                    handle Norwegian names specially, and REGISTER.EXE will
                    generate the registration form in Norwegian rather than
                    in English. 

   MyKeyID          The key id of the secret key which will be used for
                    signing PGP messages, and inserted with the [PGP MY KEY]
                    directive. If you only have one key in your secret key
                    ring, you will not have to worry about this variable.

   PGPPath          Full path to the PGP.EXE program. Note that the directory
                    in which PGP.EXE resides is not necessarily the same
                    directory where CONFIG.TXT, PUBRING.PGP and SECRING.PGP
                    will be found. The path to these files is controlled
                    through the PGPPATH environment variable.

   DownloadDir      Path to the directory where the incoming mail files (.QWK
                    and .SUP files) will be found.

   UploadDir        Path to the directory where the outgoing mail files (.REP
                    and .OUT files) will be found.

   InPackets        Default search patterns for incoming mail packets,
                    separated by semicolons (e.g. *.QW?;*.SU?). If no
                    filenames are specified when running DECRYPT, AutoPGP
                    will search DownloadDir for mail packets that match the
                    search patterns in InPackets.

   OutPackets       Default search patterns for outgoing mail packets,
                    separated by semicolons (e.g. *.RE?;*.OU?). If no
                    filenames are specified when running ENCRYPT, AutoPGP
                    will search UpLoadDir for mail packets that match the
                    search patterns in OutPackets. If you are using XBoard or
                    Offliner, you should add the following strings to the
                    list of search patterns:

                    @XBOARD=<path to XBOARD.EXE>
                    @OFFLINER=<path to OFFLINER.EXE>

   ZipPath          Full path to PkZip archiver.

   UnzipPath        Full path to PkUnzip unarchiver.

   ArjPath          Full path to Arj (un)archiver.

   LHarcPath        Full path to Lha(rc) (un)archiver.

   LogFile          Name of logfile to use with AutoPGP. The logfile provides
                    detailed information on what AutoPGP is doing 'behind the
                    scenes', and is an invaluable tool when trying to locate
                    problems and errors. Leave this blank if you don't want
                    a logfile.

   MaxLogSize       Maximum size of the logfile (in bytes). When the logfile
                    grows bigger than the size specified here, it is deleted
                    and a new, empty logfile is created. If MaxLogSize is
                    zero, the logfile will never be deleted, no matter how
                    big it gets.

   EchoPassPhrase   'Yes' or 'No', telling DECRYPT and ENCRYPT whether to
                    echo your keystrokes to the screen when you type your
                    pass phrase, making it easier to avoid misspelling. Note
                    that when set to 'Yes', AutoPGP will not echo the actual
                    characters you type, only ' ' (space) and '*' (all other
                    characters).

   KeepPassPhrase   'Yes' or 'No', telling DECRYPT and ENCRYPT whether to
                    keep the pass phrase in the PGPPASS environment variable
                    between AutoPGP sessions. The default is 'No', which
                    means that you will have to re-enter the pass phrase each
                    time ENCRYPT or DECRYPT is started. NB! This option
                    should be used with caution! See 'Security Issues' in the
                    AutoPGP FAQ (APGP-FAQ.DOC).

   ShortHeader      'Yes' or 'No', telling DECRYPT whether to remove most of
                    the Internet header from incoming messages. When you
                    import messages from Internet mail or Usenet newsgroups,
                    you may find that the first 15-20 lines of the message
                    body contain information of little or no interest.
                    Setting ShortHeader to 'Yes' (default is 'No'), will
                    remove the Internet header, except the most important
                    lines ('To:', 'From:', 'Subject:' etc).

   MarkPGPUsers     'Yes' or 'No', telling DECRYPT whether to mark PGP users
                    within the mail reader. The default setting is 'Yes'.
                    This means that if, for example, you receive an
                    unencrypted message from a person called 'John Doe' whose
                    public key is in your keyring, then AutoPGP will insert
                    the text '(John Doe uses PGP)' at the beginning of the
                    message. This makes it easy to see that replies to the
                    message may be encrypted with PGP.

   AddNewKeys       This variable tells DECRYPT what to do when it finds a
                    new public key in a message. Possible settings are:

                    Yes    = All new keys will be added to your keyring
                    No     = No new keys will be added to your keyring
                    Prompt = DECRYPT will ask the user what to do for
                             each new key (default)

   SaveFilesToDisk  'Yes', 'No' or 'Prompt', telling DECRYPT whether files
                    included in messages with the [PGP FILE] directive (i.e.
                    ASCII armoured files) should be extracted and saved as
                    separate files in your download directory. Normally this
                    option only applies to binary files (but see
                    SaveASCIIFiles below). The default setting is 'Yes'.

   SaveASCIIFiles   'Yes' or 'No', telling DECRYPT whether ASCII-files
                    included in messages with the [PGP FILE] directive should
                    be extracted as separate files, or just converted to
                    plaintext inside the message (default). If set to 'Yes',
                    the value of SaveFilesToDisk determines if the files will
                    actually be saved on your disk.

   ShowRecipients   'Yes' or 'No', telling DECRYPT whether to list all
                    persons (apart from the sender and yourself) who are able
                    to decrypt a message. The default setting is 'Yes', which
                    means that you will always know whether the message you
                    are reading was encrypted to multiple recipients and thus
                    can be read by other persons.

   MakeNDXFiles     'Yes' or 'No', telling DECRYPT whether to recreate the
                    index (.NDX) files in the QWK packet after the messages
                    have been processed. If your mail reader doesn't need the
                    .NDX files (most new readers don't), then you should set
                    this variable to 'No'.

   SkipAreas        This variable allows you to specify message areas,
                    conferences and newsgroups in which PGP messages will not
                    be processed by DECRYPT. This is particularly useful if
                    you don't want to waste time checking PGP signatures in
                    alt.security.pgp and other large newsgroups. If you
                    specify more than one message area, they should be
                    separated by commas (no spaces).

   ArmourVersion    By setting this variable you can make all your outgoing
                    PGP messages look like they have been created with a
                    different version of PGP than the one you are actually
                    using. This is particularly useful if you are using PGP
                    v2.3a and want to post your public key to a key server
                    that only accepts keys marked as v2.6 or later.
                    ArmourVersion does not have to specify a legal PGP
                    version, in fact it could be any text string ('2.3a',
                    '2.8', '5.0 beta', 'My version' etc.) If you leave
                    ArmourVersion blank, then ENCRYPT will not change the
                    version number on your outgoing messages.

   AutoPrivate      'Yes' or 'No', telling ENCRYPT whether messages that are
                    only encrypted with two public keys (your own + another
                    key) automatically should be marked as 'Private'. The
                    default setting is 'Yes'.

   AutoEncrypt      'Yes', 'No' or 'Prompt', telling ENCRYPT whether it
                    should attempt to encrypt messages that are private and
                    do not contain any [PGP ENCRYPT] or [PGP SIGN]
                    directives. The default setting is 'Prompt'.

   Greeting         This variable tells ENCRYPT to insert a greeting at the
                    top of each message. The contents of Greeting is in fact
                    a macro which is expanded according to the name of the
                    recipient of the message. Some examples:

                    Hello, %fname!
                    Dear Mr %lname,
                    In a message, %name wrote:

                    If Greeting is not set, or if the message already
                    contains the name of the recipient on the first line
                    (e.g. if your mail reader has a built-in greeting
                    function), then ENCRYPT will not insert the greeting.

   ClearSign        'Yes' or 'No', telling ENCRYPT whether to send signed
                    (unencrypted) messages as cleartext or PGP armour files
                    respectively. This variable only affects the function of
                    the [PGP SIGN] directive, and can be overridden by using
                    the [PGP SIGN ARMOUR] or [PGP SIGN CLEAR] directives when
                    signing messages. If you are not sure about the
                    differences between a clearsigned and an armour-signed
                    message, see the PGP User's Guide for details.

   QuoteSymbol      This symbol replaces the quote symbol used by some mail
                    readers with limited quoting options. Normally, you
                    should leave this blank.

   TagLine          Your own, personal tagline/sigline which will be added at
                    the end of all messages for upload, replacing the tag
                    generated by your mail reader. The following macros are
                    recognized in the TagLine string:

                    %ver    AutoPGP version number (= 2.10)
                    %regno  Your registration number (e.g. #073)

                    If TagLine is not set, ENCRYPT will not replace the
                    original tag.

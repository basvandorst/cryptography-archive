0.  About this FAQ

    This document aims at answering some of the most common questions and
    problems posed to me by users of Offline AutoPGP. Before you contact me
    with your questions, bug reports or other comments on AutoPGP, be sure to
    read this file. If you don't find what you are looking for here, then you
    can e-mail me at: staalesc@ifi.uio.no.


1.  General questions

    1.1. What is Offline AutoPGP?

         Offline AutoPGP (AutoPGP or APGP for short) is a program that
         integrates PGP encryption into your offline mail reader. AutoPGP lets
         you encrypt, decrypt and sign e-mail messages, as well as to include
         and extract public keys and ascii armoured files in the messages. The
         operation is truly seamless, and all interfacing with PGP is carried
         out automatically, with only a minimum of interaction from the user.
         AutoPGP will run on any MS-DOS compatible computer and can be used
         with any SOUP or QWK reader, as well as XBoard and Offliner, two
         popular Norwegian mail readers that use MBBS/PCBoard capture files.

    1.2. What is the current version of AutoPGP?

         The latest version of AutoPGP is 2.10. It was released on June 19th,
         1994 and replaced v2.00.

    1.3. Is AutoPGP compatible with PGP v2.6?

         Yes. AutoPGP v2.10 has been successfully tested with the following
         PGP versions: v2.3a, v2.6, v2.6ui and v2.6n. Note that AutoPGP v2.10
         is NOT compatible with PGP v2.5 (the MIT beta-release).

    1.4. Where can I obtain AutoPGP?

         AutoPGP can be downloaded from most major FTP sites that carry PGP
         and related programs. In particular, you may try:

         oak.oakland.edu/pub/msdos/offline/apgp210.zip
         ftp.dsi.unimi.it/pub/security/crypt/PGP/apgp210.zip
         ftp.gar.no/bbs/word/apgp210.zip
         ftp.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/pub/virus/crypt/pgp/tools/apgp210.zip

         Some BBSes in Norway and the US are also known to carry AutoPGP:

         SoundServer                  47-22-571600 / 47-22-571604
         Hieroglyphic Voodoo Machine  1-303-443-2457
         Colorado Catacombs           1-303-938-9654
         Group One                    1-312-752-1258 / 1-312-752-6528

         If you have access to WWW (the world wide web), you may even try the
         URL:

         http://www.ifi.uio.no/~staalesc/AutoPGP.html

    1.5. Is there a virus in DECRYPT.EXE?

         All AutoPGP .EXE files are signed with the author's public key to
         prevent hackers, NSA employees and other curious persons from
         tampering with the program. Checking the signatures regularly will
         also help you detect if a file has been infected by a virus. If
         CHECKSIG.BAT gives you good signatures, then AutoPGP is not infected
         by a virus. However, some anti-virus utilities (ThunderByte,
         Integrity Master a.o.) FALSELY report that earlier versions of
         DECRYPT.EXE contains a Mutation Engine (MtE) virus.


2.  Some common problems

    2.1. Why does not AutoPGP find the correct public key for encrypting a
         message?

         If you don't specify a userid for the [PGP ENCRYPT] directive,
         AutoPGP will look at the name of the recipient of the message to see
         if it can be deduced which public key should be used. Here is how
         AutoPGP finds the recipient's name:

         1.  First it will look in the recipient field in the QWK message
             header.
         2.  If the QWK recipient field says 'INTERNET GATEWAY@XXX', AutoPGP
             will look at the first line in the message body. If this line
             contains an Internet address, AutoPGP will use this name instead.
         3.  If the message body contains an Internet header, AutoPGP will use
             the 'To:'-field as the name of the recipient, rather than the
             name given in the QWK header.

         Now AutoPGP knows the name (or the Internet address) of the recipient
         of the message. Normally, this should be enough to find the correct
         key in your public key ring. There are, however, times when this is
         not possible:

         -   you don't have the recipient's public key in your keyring
             (obviously)
         -   you have accidentally misspelled the recipient's name or Internet
             address
         -   the name in the userid of the recipient's public key differs from
             the login name he is using on the BBS
         -   the recipient has several Internet addresses, and they are not
             all listed in his or her userids
         -   the name of the recipient has been truncated, because the QWK
             recipient field has a limit of 25 characters
         -   the recipient has more than one public key, and AutoPGP does not
             know which one to use

         If any of these situations should arise, then AutoPGP cannot figure
         out which public key to use. Instead, you will have to pick the
         correct key manually. You will also be prompted whether you would
         like to use the key you chose for later messages to the same person.
         If you answer Y(es) to this question, AutoPGP will update the
         KEYS.DAT file in your AutoPGP directory so that the next time you
         encrypt a message to this person, AutoPGP will know which key to use.

    2.2. The AutoEncrypt feature does not seem to work. Is this a bug?

         The AutoEncrypt feature works very well, provided that the following
         two criteria are met:

         a.  The message that is to be encrypted must be marked as 'private'.
             Public messages will not be encrypted (unless, of course, you use
             the '[PGP ENCRYPT]' directive).

         b.  AutoPGP must be able to sort out that you have the recipient's
             public key in your keyring. If the name of the recipient differs
             from the name in the userid of the key, AutoPGP will think that
             you don't have the required public key. However, if you have
             previously told AutoPGP which key to use for this person (i.e.
             when encrypting manually), the KEYS.DAT file in your AutoPGP
             directory is updated and AutoPGP will know which key to use.
             (Also see 2.1.)

    2.3. Why do I keep getting 'Bad signature' on my clearsigned messages?

         a.  If you are using version 2.3 of PGP, you should upgrade to 2.3a.
             Version 2.3 had a problem with clearsigned messages, which has
             been fixed in 2.3a.

         b.  Most BBS systems have a limit on the number of characters allowed
             per message line (usually in the range 72-80). If you write a
             message that contains very long lines, the excess characters will
             either be stripped or word-wrapped to the next line. This may
             have consequences for clearsigned messages, because PGP will give
             you a 'Bad signature' error if the message has been altered by
             the BBS system (or anyone else, for that matter). If you use a
             line length of no more than 70 characters, you should be on the
             safe side.

    2.4. Sometimes AutoPGP displays an error message when encrypting messages,
         but it flashes by so quickly that I cannot read it. Is this
         important?

         No, this is simply PGP giving you a warning that the key you are
         using is not certified with enough trusted keys. This only means that
         it's probably a good idea to verify the authenticity of the key. If
         it was anything important (e.g. if PGP could not encrypt the
         message), then AutoPGP would have stopped and prompted you to press
         a key in order to let you read the message before proceeding.


3.  Hints and tips

    3.1. What can I do to speed up AutoPGP?

         PGP encryption and decryption are very time-consuming operations, and
         usually there is not much you can do about that part (unless you buy
         a faster CPU). However, there are a few tricks that will normally
         reduce the running time of AutoPGP:

         a.  If you have a RAM disk installed on your system, you should set
             the TMP environment variable to point at it. This will cause both
             PGP and AutoPGP to use the RAM disk rather than the harddisk for
             storing temporary files, thereby reducing the overall running
             time. See AUTOPGP.DOC for details.

         b.  If your mail reader lets you specify the full command line string
             that will be passed to your archiving program, you should use the
             fastest (and simplest) compression method available. For example,
             if you are using PkZip, you should specify that the .REP files
             be packed using the '-e0' (no compression) option. Since the .REP
             files will be unpacked by ENCRYPT anyway, there is no point in
             vasting time on compression. When ENCRYPT is finished processing
             the messages, it will repack the .REP files using normal
             compression.

         c.  If your mail reader doesn't need the .NDX files in the QWK packet
             (most new readers don't), then you should set the MakeNDXFiles
             variable in AUTOPGP.CFG to 'No'.

         d.  If you login to only one or a few BBSes, then it could be a good
             idea to modify your <READER>.BAT file so that AutoPGP will not
             start unless any mail packets are present. For instance, if you
             are only going to use AutoPGP on 'MyBBS', you should modify the
             lines that call DECRYPT and ENCRYPT:

             IF EXIST C:\READER\QWK\MYBBS.QWK DECRYPT.EXE
             IF EXIST C:\READER\REP\MYBBS.REP ENCRYPT.EXE

             This will save time, because then DECRYPT and ENCRYPT will not
             have to initialize themselves and read the AUTOPGP.CFG
             configuration file only to find that there is nothing to do.

    3.2. How can I use AutoPGP to review or re-edit outgoing messages that
         have already been encrypted?

         You can't. If the .REP files have already been processed by ENCRYPT,
         then the messages are encrypted and further editing is pointless. In
         order to alter the contents of an encrypted message, you will have
         to save it to a file, manually decrypt it using PGP, and then re-
         import it into the mail reader. With a little thought it is possible
         to avoid such situations, though. Here are two suggestions:

         a.  If your mail reader has a message base or 'folder' in which
             outgoing messages are stored, you should wait until the last
             possible minute (i.e. just before uploading the messages) before
             you export the messages to the .REP file.

         b.  Another way to postpone the use of ENCRYPT is simply to remove
             it from the <READER>.BAT file. Instead, you can create a new
             batch file that will call ENCRYPT and your communications program
             - in that order. In this way you can ensure that ENCRYPT will not
             be called until just before the messages are uploaded.

    3.3. How do I use AutoPGP under a multitasking environment?

         There are usually no problems involved in using AutoPGP under a
         multitasking environment, such as Windows, DesQView or OS/2. However,
         if you are using DesQView, you should make sure that you have the
         following settings in the DV window setup:

         Close on exit (Y,N,blank)......: [N]
         Allow Close Window command.....: [Y]

         This will ensure that the <READER>.BAT file is executed properly, and
         that the window is not closed after DECRYPT.EXE is finished.

         Another thing you should be aware of, is the fact that <READER>.BAT
         will only call DECRYPT once before starting your mail reader. If you
         are downloading new .QWK packets in one window while reading and
         writing messages in another, you will have to make sure that DECRYPT
         is run once again before you import the new .QWK packets into your
         mail reader. Otherwise the incoming messages will not be decrypted.
         This could be accomplished by running DECRYPT manually in a separate
         window, or by creating a batch file that will automatically call
         DECRYPT just after you have quit your communications program. Some
         mail readers will also let you define external programs that can be
         run from inside the reader itself.


4.  Security issues

    4.1. Where does AutoPGP store my pass phrase?

         When AutoPGP needs your pass phrase in order to unlock your secret
         key, it will first look in the PGPPASS environment variable to see
         if the pass phrase is defined here. If it is not, or if the pass
         phrase found in PGPPASS is incorrect, AutoPGP will prompt you for the
         correct pass phrase. The pass phrase which you enter is stored in an
         internal variable inside the DECRYPT (or ENCRYPT) program in case the
         program needs to access your secret key more than once. It is NOT
         stored in the PGPPASS environment variable (unless KeepPassPhrase is
         set to 'Yes', see below), neither is it placed in a separate file on
         your harddisk or anywhere else where it could easily be found. Once
         DECRYPT (or ENCRYPT) is finished, the pass phrase will be erased from
         memory and overwritten by other data, making it impossible for other
         programs to scan the memory for anything that might look like a pass
         phrase. However, if the KeepPassPhrase option in AUTOPGP.CFG is set
         to 'Yes', DECRYPT (or ENCRYPT) will copy your pass phrase to the
         PGPPASS environment variable before exiting the program. Although
         this may seem convenient, since it makes it possible to run AutoPGP
         multiple times without having to retype the pass phrase each time,
         this option should be used with extreme caution! If your computer is
         connected to a network, or if there are other people than yourself
         that are likely to use your computer, you should leave the
         KeepPassPhrase option alone and NOT use PGPPASS to store your pass
         phrase.

    4.2. Once AutoPGP has decrypted my incoming mail, it is stored as
         plaintext on my harddisk. How can I protect these data from a
         potential intruder?

         This is one of the main hazards of using a program like AutoPGP.
         Although AutoPGP makes it very easy to send encrypted messages safely
         through e-mail channels, once the messages are transferred to your
         computer, they are decrypted and stored unencrypted on your harddisk,
         making it possible for anyone who has access to your computer to be
         able to read your private mail. Using a power-on password check
         built-in to your ROM or BIOS offers at least a minimum of protection,
         but if your computer is connected to a network, or if there is more
         than one person using it, this is usually not enough. Fortunately,
         there exists a number of programs which allow you to password protect
         parts of your harddisk. Some of these (such as Norton Diskreet) use
         very simple encryption (e.g. DES), but there are currently being
         developed more advanced harddisk encryption programs, some of which
         are highly recommendable. These include:

         * SecureDrive v1.3d by Mike Ingle and Edgar Swank (not to be
           exported from the USA).
         * Secure File System (SFS) v1.0 by Peter Gutmann, co-author of PGP.
         * SecureDevice v1.3 by Max Loewenthal and Arthur Helwig.

         The programs can be downloaded by anonymous FTP from:

         soda.berkeley.edu/pub/cypherpunks/crypto??????/secdr13d.zip
         garbo.uwasa.fi/pc/crypt/sfs100.zip
         wuarchive.wust.edu/pub/MSDOS_UPLOADS/cryptography/secdev13.arj

         All three programs are freeware, and they all use IDEA encryption,
         the same algorithm as found in PGP. If you are truly concerned about
         your safety, you should consider obtaining one of these programs.
         With these you can encrypt the harddisk partitions where PGP, AutoPGP
         and your mail reader are stored, making it impossible for people who
         do not have the correct password to read your mail, although they
         have access to all other parts of your computer hardware.

    4.3. When AutoPGP extracts ASCII armoured files from my incoming messages,
         they are copied onto my harddisk. How do I know that these files do
         not contain any viruses?

         Although the [PGP FILE] directive makes it easy for you to include
         files in your outgoing messages, it makes it just as easy for other
         AutoPGP users to send files and programs to you, programs that may
         contain viruses, trojan horses or other things that you don't want
         to have on your computer. Of course, AutoPGP will never try to
         execute any of these programs, but the thought of just having such
         files lying around on your harddisk is certainly not a very
         comforting one. Thus you should always be just as careful with files
         that are sent to you in ASCII armoured messages, as you are with
         files that you obtain from other sources. Always check the programs
         with an anti-virus utility, and never try to run a file that comes
         from someone whom you do not trust. You should also consider setting
         the SaveFilesToDisk variable in AUTOPGP.CFG to 'No' or 'Prompt'. Keep
         in mind that you can always go back and use PGP manually on your old
         messages (provided, of course, that you have not deleted them) and
         extract ASCII armoured files that you did not extract with AutoPGP
         when you first got them.

    4.4. How can I be sure that AutoPGP does not contain any hidden
         instructions to give away my secret key and pass phrase and send them
         in an encrypted message to the NSA or anyone else?

         Well, to put it bluntly: You can't. Since AutoPGP is shareware and
         the source code is not publicly accessible, there is no way you can
         be 100% sure that I, the author, have not included any 'back doors'
         or other undocumented functions into AutoPGP. However, since all
         outgoing, encrypted messages generated by AutoPGP are also encrypted
         with your own public key, you have at all times full control of what
         goes out from your computer. If one of your messages suddenly
         contains any strange characters that you did not put there yourself,
         then you know that something odd is going on. Or similarly, if PGP
         one day refuses to decrypt your own messages because you do not have
         the required public key, it would certainly arouse your suspicion.
         In fact, the only possible way (at least that I can think of) in
         which AutoPGP would be able to include any extra, hidden information
         in your outgoing mail without you knowing it, would be if it
         generated TWO messages, one of which contained the actual message,
         encrypted with both the recipients' and your own key, and another,
         hidden message which was encrypted with someone else's key (probably
         mine or one belonging to the NSA). If these two messages were merged
         into one file, then an attempt to decrypt the file with PGP would
         only reveal the first message. This is because PGP stops after
         decrypting the first message, even if the file contains more PGP
         messages. (Maybe something to think about in future versions of PGP?)
         So in order to verify that the messages generated by AutoPGP does not
         contain any hidden information, you will have to check the files
         manually or write a program that does it for you. (The PGP file
         format is explained in the file PGFORMAT.DOC, which is distributed
         together with the PGP source code.) Of course, since you will not
         check every single message generated by AutoPGP, you cannot be sure
         that in one of every hundred messages, AutoPGP will not append your
         pass phrase, secret key or other information in a 'tail message'
         following the real message. But this is only theoretically possible,
         because if AutoPGP really contained such an instruction, then you
         could be sure that someone would eventually find out about it. (And
         just imagine what this would mean to me and my credibility!) In fact,
         the best guarantee you have that AutoPGP is not doing anything
         mischievous or dishonest, is the growing number of people using the
         program. The more people who use AutoPGP, the greater the chance that
         someone would find out about it, should the program contain any such
         hidden instructions.


5.  Future releases

    5.1. Will my mail reader be recognized by the next version of INSTALL?

         If your QWK mail reader is not listed by the INSTALL program, or if
         you are using a newer version than the one which is listed, please
         let me know. I would also like a copy of your mail reader's
         configuration file (i.e. the file where the QWK and REP directories
         are specified). Currently INSTALL only recognizes DOS-based readers,
         but in later versions I will probably add some of the most popular
         Windows and OS/2 readers.

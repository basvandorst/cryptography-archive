       pgp.cfg - Format of the configuration file used by ppggpp(1).

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The default location for this file  is  ~/.pgp.   You  may
       specify  another location by setting the environment vari­
       able  _P_G_P_P_A_T_H.   SH  COMMAND-LINE  SPECIFICATION  All  PGP
       applications  accept  these  options as command-line argu­
       ments, as well.  Command line  arguments  always  override
       the configuration file.  Options are specified with a dou­
       ble-dash (--) or plus (+), followed by an equal  sign  (=)
       and  the  value,  if appropriate.  For example, to specify
       the public keyring to use on an encryption operation:

       _p_g_p_e _-_r _f_o_o_@_b_a_r_._b_a_z_._c_o_m _-_-_p_u_b_r_i_n_g_=_~_/_f_o_o_r_i_n_g_._p_k_r

       To turn on text mode, in an encryption:

       _p_g_p_e _-_r _f_o_o_@_b_a_r_._b_a_z_._c_o_m _-_-_t_e_x_t_m_o_d_e

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       The following configuration options are supported, both in
       the  _p_g_p_._c_f_g  file and on the command line of PGP applica­
       tions.  Case is not important in specifying  the  variable
       names,  but  may  be in specifying filenames, depending on
       your operating environment.   Immediately  following  each
       option  is  a  description of its type:  Boolean is either
       "1" or "on" or "0" or "off"; String is a string; and Inte­
       ger is a number.

       Armor  Boolean.   Turns  ASCII  armoring  on  or off.  The
              default is off.

       ArmorLines
              Integer.  Specifies the  maximum  number  of  lines
              that  may be contained in an ASCII armored message.
              Messages longer than this number of lines  will  be
              broken  up  into multi-part ASCII armored messages.
              A value of zero indicates an  unlimited  number  of
              lines.  The default is zero.

       AutoServerFetch
              Boolean.   If on, when adding keys with ppggppkk(1), if
              a specified key file is not found, it is assumed to
              be  the name of a key to retrieve from your default
              key  server  (see  _H_T_T_P_K_e_y_S_e_r_v_e_r_H_o_s_t  and  _H_T_T_P_K_e_y_­
              _S_e_r_v_e_r_P_o_r_t,    below).     Some   intelligence   is
              attempted; even if this is on, if it is  obvious  a
              file  was  intended  (if  the  first characters are
              either "/" or "./"), a fetch will not be made.  The
              default is on.

       Compress
              Boolean.   Specifies  whether  messages  should  be

              compressed prior to encryption.  The default is on.

       EncryptToSelf
              Boolean.   If  on,  automatically encrypts all mes­
              sages to your  default  key,  as  well  as  to  the
              intended  recipient.  Intended to allow you to read
              encrypted mail you've sent.  The default is off.

       FastKeyGen
              Boolean.  Utilizes pre-generated prime numbers  for
              certain  initial  operations  on DSS/Diffie-Hellman
              key generation.  This only works for "standard" key
              sizes  (1024,  1596  and 2048).  The default is on.
              To turn this off, use: _p_g_p_k _+_f_a_s_t_k_e_y_g_e_n_=_0 _-_g

       HTTPKeyServerHost
              String.  The name of a keyserver to use in  default
              lookups  (see _A_u_t_o_S_e_r_v_e_r_F_e_t_c_h, above).  The default
              is pgpkeys.mit.edu.

       HTTPKeyServerPort
              Integer.  The port to use for  connections  to  the
              default  key  server as specified in _H_T_T_P_K_e_y_S_e_r_v_e_r_­
              _H_o_s_t, above.  The default  is  11371,  the  default
              port for the Horowitz Key Protocol.

       Language
              String.   The country code of the language you wish
              to use.  The default is "us."

       LanguageFile
              String.   The  file  from  which  to  load  runtime
              strings.   The  default is "language50.txt" in your
              .pgp directory.  If this file does not  exist,  PGP
              will use internal defaults.

       MyName String.   The  key  ID  you  wish to be default for
              signing operations and  the  _E_n_c_r_y_p_t_T_o_S_e_l_f  option,
              above.   There  is  no default; however, if none is
              specified, the first  secret  key  on  your  secret
              keyring will be used for most operations.

       NoBatchInvalidKeys
              Boolean.  If True, batch mode will fail if the user
              attempts to encrypt to a key that is invalid or not
              completely  valid.   If  false, batch mode will use
              invalid keys.  Note that this option  only  applies
              to  batch  mode; normally, PGP will ask the user to
              confirm prior to encrypting to in an  invalid  key.
              The default is on.

       PubRing
              String.   Your public keyring file.  The default is
              "pubring.pkr" in your .pgp directory.

       RandomDevice
              String.  Entropy-generating device.  If present, it
              will  be  used in favor of asking the user for key­
              board input.  The default is "/dev/random."

       SecRing
              String.  Your secret keyring file.  The default  is
              "secring.skr" in your .pgp directory.

       WarnOnMixRSADiffieHellman
              Boolean.   Warns the user if encrypting to multiple
              keys, one or more of which is RSA and one  or  more
              of  which  is  DSS/Diffie-Hellman.   The reason for
              this warning is that most RSA key owners will still
              be  using  2.6.2,  which  will not properly decrypt
              such messages.  The default is on.

       WarnOnRSARecipAndNonRSASigner
              Boolean.  Warns the user if encrypting  to  an  RSA
              key,  but  signing  with  a DSS/Diffie-Hellman key.
              The reason for this warning is that  most  RSA  key
              owners  will  still  be using 2.6.2, which will not
              properly decrypt such messages.  The default is on.

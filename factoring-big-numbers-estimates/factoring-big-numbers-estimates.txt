Here is a message that I posted on alt.security.pgp outlining some recent
computations that I have done:

 ---

Btw. I did some computations to determine how long it should take to
factor different length keys using the best technology available today
(mpqs).  Using the fact that rsa120 was factored with an effort
equivalent to 830 MIP-YEARS I computed that:

rsa129 (429 bits):	4,600 MIP-YEARS (this is currently being worked on!)
a 512 bit key	      420,000 MIP-YEARS (safe for a little while!)
a 700 bit key	4,200,000,000 MIP-YEARS (seems pretty safe to me!)
a 1024 bit key      2.8 x 10^15 MIP-YEARS (Wow!)

Nothing like exponential processes.

There are factoring algorithms which may prove faster then mpqs when
applied to larger numbers (i.e., the gnfs algorithm). However these
are still exponential algorithms and I doubt if they will do any
better then knock a few orders of magnitude off the work required to
factor that 1024 bit key!

Of course if a polynomial time algorithm is discovered, all bets are
off, regardless of your key length!

John Kelsey suggested subject titles more accurately describe the thread
as opposed to "DES is Dead".  So noted.

Clarification:  The US distributor of "Germany's Excellent DES chip"
comply with  ITAR for US based shipments.  Sales from their home office
in Germany complies with Cocom. (Thanks Colin)

understand, Mr Barney?

Mike
Sure, and 120.10 (Tech Data), and 121.8(f) "Software", and ... , as well
as having received comodity jurisdictions and formal opinions.  Webster
and the latter two contextually clarify "publish".    

The    "*if*"   ("And *if* source software...") in the second sentence
above  appears to be the significant point of contention.   Many 13b
exporters would be happy to see you prevail.  Few expect you will.  

If it were that easy, ("publish" around ITAR/Cocom)  Cylink, Datotek,
Cycom, TCC, TRW, ATT....... wouldn't  submit for, or wait on licenses.

It's unlikely either of us will change our positions.

I don't disagree "source" in and of itself can't encrypt.  We sincerely
disagree on whether or not it requires a license.  I believe the USG is /
will raise the same issue. 

I do wish you the best in your endeavors.

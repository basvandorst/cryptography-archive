Ok, i've already received two replies telling me they couldn't
gather anything from what i said (i was too vague).  Well, the
vagueness stems from the fact that i don't know that much about
the subject, just hearsay from some buddies...  I don't know 
the name of the device (if it indeed is a particular device)
nor do i know the company name or any individuals involved.  My
post was intended just to generate some responses like:

	"Well, i don't know if this is what you were referring
to, but CompanyX just developed ..."

With such responses, i could have several places to begin a more
detailed search, or if i don't hear much, i may have to abandon
the idea altogether.  Anyway, when i first saw sci.crypt and
talk.politics.crypto i assumed that if i could find anyone who
was on top of the subject and the latest news, they would be here.

Thanks again-
T. Smith

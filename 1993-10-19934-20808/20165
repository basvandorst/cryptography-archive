Does anyone know of the whereabouts of some software similar to
Symantecs Diskreet out there that has the source with it.  It does
not have to be fancy, just customizable.  We don't particularly
need a fancy encryption method, just a few specialized features
(like the ability to have multiple passwords access the same
drive.)  For those who don't know the dos world software too
well, diskreet makes a virtual drive on your hard drive, encrypts
it, and requires a password before you can access it.  

Thanks, 
Dave

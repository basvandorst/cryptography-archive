one day last week i caught the tail-end of a news piece (on ABC) about
a group of granny's in the UK raiding a nsa listing post and walking 
away with classsied documents.  i looked on cnn and other networks and 
prusued the nytimes, but to no avail.  did anyone catch this piece ?
it sounds too funny to miss, share it with us, svp...


cheers,
        paul

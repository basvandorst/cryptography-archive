Lots of stuff deleted.

More good stuff deleted.

I also know of very little literature on solving double transpositions
other than for the simple cases (several messages in the same key and of
the same length).

Perhaps someone could post several realistic examples of ciphertext, so
we could get a feel for how difficult it really is and hone our skills
at cryptanalysis.  I'd suggest messages varying in length between 50 and
500 characters, with a variety of keys.  Some messages would be flagged
as probably sharing the same keys.  Some would have background
information attached (so hinting at probable words).

Anyone fancy doing this?

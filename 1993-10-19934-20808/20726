How do you get this?  I haven't done *exhaustive* testing, but I came
up with a laughable 2^9 keyspace.  If you encrypt a file with any huge
nasty number, try taking the modulus of that number and encrypting
again.  The results of both encryptions are identical.  This led me to
conclude that the key space was 2^8 (from the modulus) * 2 (could be
positive or negative) = 2^9 or a massive 512 keys!

I also tried replacing the huge long nasty looking multiplier with its
modulus ( a not so nasty 53 ) and got the same results.

I had such a good laugh when I figured this - was I wrong?

You mean READ access to the system startup script?
You could put the password in a read-by-root-only file and use
startserver -passwd 'cat /etc/mysecretpasswd'
to start it as the rc file is executed by root.
Perhaps read-protecting the rc file would be too simple?

Preventing someone with root priviledges to get hold of the password
is probably more than just tricky.

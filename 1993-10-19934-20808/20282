It's always a bad idea to write this sort of thing--one might end up with
egg on one's face. 
 
That both Dentists and Shoemakers are listed in the classified directory
does not make a Dentist into a Shoemaker. The phone company doesn't have
separate directories for each.

That plumbers and economic consultants both have to register for a business
license and are kept on a single list of those registered for a business
license (at least in Los Angeles and Pasadena) doesn't mean that the plumber
is being forced to register as an economic consultant.

That munitions makers who don't export and international arms dealers both
have to register on the ITAR-related list does not make a non-exporting
maker into an international arms dealer, nor is it requiring registration of
him as such.

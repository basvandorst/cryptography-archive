Well, IBM, in the US, owns the patent rights to the DES algorithm since it
was derived from their LUCIFER algorithm.  Anyways, I recall that IBM has
extended free and royalty free rights to use the DES algorithm with
the conditions that it be used INTACT and un-modified.  Thus, I suppose it 
would be a violation of IBM's patent on DES if someone were to market or use
a modified version of it.

I believe this law in question was rejected due to overwhelming protest by
civil liberties groups and the phone companies (complaining of excess expense).
But, the newspaper said that the FBI intended to have the bill resubmitted 
in an amended form.

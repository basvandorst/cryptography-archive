I agree with this.  Don't bother abandoning sci.crypt.  Install a moderator
(or two) and reclaim it.

I agree about the D.S. problem.  For example, it does not take exceptional
brilliance to assume that the EFF would talk to Phil Zimmermann before
announcing that they are supporting his case, contributing money to his
legal defence, and providing the address of the fund.  Where do you think
they *got* the address of the fund?  Nancy Reagan's psychic?

I would like to read you a famous bit of U.S. culture: "You have the right
to remain silent.  If you give up that right, anything you say can be used
in a court of law."  (Apologies if it's not exact, but you know what I mean.)

It seems that shutting up and not leaking clues is often beneficial to the
defence's case in a trial.  This might explain the lack of news from Philip
directly.

Ob. technical: has anyone looked at the MPJ encryption algorithm?
It's a 128-bit block length and key, with 8 rounds of 16 8->8 bit
key-dependent permutation S-boxes interleaved with 7 rounds of a fixed
permutation that makes each S box's 8 inputs come from different S boxes
in the previous round.

The S-box generation is done by repeating the 16-byte key indefinitely,
and taking 128 8-bit values, the 64 7-bit values, etc. and multiplying
by n/255, n/127, n/63, etc. as n goes from 255 to 0, and then putting
n into the resultant-numbered unoccupied slot in the S-box.

First, the values taken from the key stream will be the same for equal
n modulo 16 in the first 128, and the n/255 rounding introduces a bias
towards zero in the choices.

But does anyone know anything about attacking the cipher directly?

With all due respect to Phil Karn, I wish those making this claim would
post the specific FCC reg that mentions this list and the restrictions imposed.
There is simply no such thing as "regulations not in use" -- all regulations
must be published and all published regs are in effect.
I couldn't find this list mentioned in the prohibited section of the current
regs, which go like this:

97.113 Prohibited practices
 (a) Commercial and third-party traffic
 (b) Compensation
 (c) Broadcasting
 (d) Music, codes, cyphers, obscenity
 (e) Non-repeater retransmission
97.115 Third party communications allowed
 (a)(1) To any US station
 (a)(2) Any foreign country having arranged for TPT with US govt

So where is the reg specifying a country list? Even the FCC tells me it
isn't there. There is a reg under 97.111_Authorized_Transmissions allowing
a foreign country to give notice that it objects to US transmissions, but
the FCC simply publishes those as public notices -- communications are not
prohibited by this reg. 

And 97.115 (a)(2) talks about third party traffic as being allowed ONLY
WHEN PRIOR ARRANGEMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE BY THE FOREIGN GOVT WITH THE U.S.
This is the exact inverse of a prohibited list, and doesn't apply to amateur
communications, only third party traffic.

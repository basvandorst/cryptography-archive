>Wouldn't this method be open to a known plain text attack?

	The set of individuals with the knowledge, equipment, and
motivation to launch a known-plaintext attack on DES is much
smaller than the set of individuals with access to etherfind and
perl.

	As long as that's the case, using something like a Racal
Watchword or a Digital Pathways or an Enigma Logic is a win.

	Part of the fun game you get to play when you're dealing
with security is asking yourself "what's the risk?"   You need to
determine how much you have to lose, how high-level an attack you
may come under, how much the solutions cost, and so forth, then
factor them all in and decide if it's worth it, first. I'd hope
that if your computer contains nothing but CS undergrads' home
directories you'd put less effort into securing it than if it
was the launch control system for a 100Mb nuke. Please.

	It's like the "$10 helmet for your $10 head" approach
to motorcycling. If you value it, it's worth protecting if there's
a reasonable chance it'll get hurt.

I'm just curious what good a function like this might be.  The
"brute-force" attack on it (1024 searches) seems sufficiently trivial
that an enemy should have no trouble computing the reverse function.
I suppose if the issue were simply of who could compute the reverse
function *first* then it might differentiate the encoder from the
enemy (some kind of time-dependent game, for example).  But even then,
for a given key, an enemy could generate a lookup table from the
brute-force search, and subsequent lookups would be very "cheap".

As to an answer, I suppose an easy way to make such a function, where
keys of (more than) 32-bits are used would be:

	Define f(M) --> C	; 8bits --> 32bits

	for M=m1...m8; C=c1c2...c32; K=k1...k32; 
		X=MMMM=x1...x32; I(intermediate)=i1...i32
	define c0 and i0 as you like, i.e. zero or one.

	Let i(n) = i(n-1) xor x(n) xor k(n)
	Let c(n) = c(n-1) xor i(n) xor k(n)

I'm pretty sure that gives you the desired properties.

Yours, Lulu...

The purpose of course, is to be able to send secret messages
without having a computer with you.  While you would not want
to do it all of the time, I can certainly see advantages to
having such a system available.

Perhaps I good compromise between paper and pencil algorithms
and full computer implemented schemes would be some sort of
calculator encryption scheme.  It would be simple to use on
computers, not to difficult with a calculator, and possibly
doable by hand in a pinch.  Has anyone ever heard of such a
scheme?

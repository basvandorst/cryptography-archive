there is not really a problem. moving sectors aroung is nothing but reading
and then writing, which the device driver that will do the encryption can
handle, just like it can handle reading or writing files. encryption would be
transparent to any software that mess with the disk, unless they are run when
the device driver is not present, or read/write directly thru hard disk
controller i/o ports.

yes, this *is* a problem.

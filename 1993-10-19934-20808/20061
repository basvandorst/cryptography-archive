Yes, we all must be very careful of not just what we DO, but what we
MIGHT POSSIBLY do in some bureaucrat's opinion.  And whenever we
communicate with the government, we must remember to express everything
in the most servile terms humanly possible.  To do otherwise costs one
thousandss of dollars, in "expensive lessons", designed to 'put us in
our place', and maybe gets one thrown in 're-education' centers.

It is a sad commentary that one must even THINK in terms such as that
in dealing with a "government of the people by the people".  One would
think it is a government of the serfs by their lords and masters.  The
people in the USG definitely do.

Something is VERY out of kilter here.  Somehow, I don't think that was
what the people who wrote our Constitution and Bill of Rights had in
mind.  Methinks our government should be as concerned about rights here
at home as they are about them on other continents.

And we have an administration that has no intention of changing it, if
press releases and past behavior are any indication.

Keywords: unix,crypt


Does anyone know what the limit of characters you can give crypt,
standard unix crypt, as a key ? Can you give it a file to use as your
key ?

Also, is there a better crypt, one that is nearly impossible to crack
that is public domain software ? Possibly available on an ftp server ?

Is crypt harder to crack if the files are first tar compacted then
compressed ?

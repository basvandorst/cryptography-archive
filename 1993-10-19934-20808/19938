It is by now an open secret that last year, DEC shipped a freeware
CD-ROM containing a DES implementation.  They no longer do so.

The real irony is that the DES code shipped was part of Crack, and
written in Europe.  DEC had had to import the code to the US (or use
someone else's import) before they could re-export it on the CD-ROM

I have no idea whether DEC had their wrists slapped for this action.

The following is from: A. Ekert, J. Rarity, P. Tapster, and G. Palma, Phys. Rev. Lett.
				vol. 69, p. 1293.

....We have performed a preliminary experiment where one beam propagated 
over 170m through a *multimode* optical fiber before the interferometer, 
but here the measured correlation coefficient was low, partly due to poor 
time resolutio in the detectors.

....Maintaining polarization in optical fiber (without in effect measuring 
it) is not possible using present technology.  Using standard low-loss, 
*insensitive* interfermoters out system may be capable of key sharing over
long (~10-20 km) distances.

	Both of these statements make me think that this method may allow for
multi*node* optical cables.
	The second statement seems to say, whereas polarization can't use
long cables, interferometry may be able to because that property which is
important (the phasing) won't be disturbed because they are using
*insensitive* interferometers maybe?

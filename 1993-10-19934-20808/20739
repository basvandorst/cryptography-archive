A search for various magic numbers ("MZ" for .EXE, "PK",0x03,0x04 for
.ZIP, "GIF" for .GIF, 0xE9 is popular among my .COMs) at the head of the
file might be helpful.  The challenge does state that "... if you
succeed in decrypting them you should have no trouble identifying them."
which says to me that they are either in a well-know format or are ASCII
text.

But I suppose you have already considered this.  :)

I understand that the Privacy Enhanced Message text line signifies that
it's supposed to be an 'official' PEM; but still - so what?  If one put
"privacy enhanced message" (foolish to wave a red flag, but....) it
_could_ mean "privacy enhanced message" - _literally_ - without being
'official' PEM.

For 'official' PEM, agreed.

We're talking circles, here - presupposing I've already made an arrangement
with another party that we're going to use some combination of
cipher/password to exchange keys (FedEx each other a list, tell each other
over the phone, by snailmail, flashing signal mirrors from a
hilltop at high noon, whatever). First message I send, I encrypt it, and
send it off with a text header of "Here's the stuff you wanted." followed
by what looks like a UUENCODEd executable. Why on earth would I want to
tell any eavesdropper what cipher I used, or even IF I used a cipher?

"Here's the stuff you wanted.

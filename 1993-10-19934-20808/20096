What don't YOU understand about the following arguement:

PGP is clearly exempt public domain technical data, as defined in ITAR,
hence, not subject to ITAR, by the relevant section of the definitions. 
(As I recall "public domain technical data" appears earlier in ITAR, and
says that such is not subject to State's jurisdiction.  As ITAR only
describes State's jurisdiction, you seem to have a comprehension problem.)

If PGP _source_ is also encryption _software_, as defined in ITAR 13b, then
then ITAR is self-contradictory with respect to PGP, hence void.

If PGP _source is not encryption _software_, it is still not covered by
ITAR.

(In any case, lawyers from the State Department have said that ITAR is
probably an unconstitutional restriction of speech.  I would hope that if
Grady and/or Phil Z. go to trial, they will subpeona the lawyers who have
publicaly said that.)



>The primary point:

Perhaps true (and unconstitutional); I have suspect that _source_ IS
covered by the First Amendment.  But also irrelevant; Public Domain
Technical Data is not subject to ITAR restrictions.

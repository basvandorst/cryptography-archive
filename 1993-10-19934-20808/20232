Sandia also did most of the bomb security, the "permissive action
links" (PALs) that arm/disarm bombs. Lots of crypto in that, and Gus
Simmons (editor of the recent "Contemporary Cryptology" book of
course) was a top-notch researcher and main moving force in the PAL
business.

There were/are probably many formal links between NSA and Sandia,
which is a contractor for various government agencies.

Although I'm not a fan of software patents, the IDEA cipher used in
PGP is patented, for example.  Most good ciphers available to civilians
are invented by university professors.  Although Xerox has done some
work, Bell Norhtern Research has recently made its name, and, of course,
IBM originalted the DES.

Oh, they *attempt*, but they rarely *succeed*.  See Biham and Shamir's
book to see how the most trivial changes to DES, that appear harmless
without knowledge of differential cryptanalysis, seriously weaken the
cipher.  One of the ciphers they attacked in their book, which was a
serious attempt to design a strong cipher, can be broken with six (6)
chosen plaintexts.

You are supposing that you have 10 good ciphers.  It takes several
years of cracking attempts by good people to put a cipher in the "good"
category.  I can't wait that long.  And remember it will take more
than 10*3 years, since people have to wade through the not-good ciphers
as well.

To repeat my main point: designing a good cipher is EXTREMELY difficult.
Proving it's good is even harder.  Your bland assumption that we'll have
10 good ones is where my reality check fails.  Furthermore, if we have
*one* good one, that's all we really need (just use DES three times,
at 168 bits, or whatever, and forget about the piddling 10 bits).
Our effort is better spent trying to attack it and prove it good than
diluting it working on others.

Brian Snow, chief cryptographer of the NSA, says he wouldn't
trust a cipher designed by anyone who hasn't "earned their
bones by first sepnding a lot of time cracking codes."
The fact that virually nobody outside intelligence agencies has
such experience "makes our job at the NSA so much easier."

I say yet again: good ciphers are *extremely* hard to come by.

I didn't say I was any damn good at cryptanalysis.  I just said that
most of the ciphers I've encountered were so amazingly weak even I could
see how to break them.  Lots of state does not a good cipher make.

Did anyone attempt to break your cipher?  Unless several someones have,
it's not trustworthy.

No, I don't.  I don't release ciphers I design.  PGP uses IDEA, which
better cryptologists than I have pounded on quite hard.

I do the cryptosystem - the impedimentia of protocols and formats,
key management and framing.  The core algorithms I take as sacred.

Oh, I read the literature and, IMHO, IDEA is the best conventional
cipher I know of.  That's why I use it.  But I had less to do with
its design than the NSA had to do with DES's.  I'll claim that PGP
is a good cryptosystem.  But I am totally incompetent to design
a cipher.  I looked on the shelf and picked the best I could find.

It depends on how hard I've tried, on big-league scales.  I'd certainly
advise investors that, if I and others have failed for 5 years, it's
unlikely that others will succeed in the next 5.  (This is assuming
I'm good at what it is I'm attempting.  For the real world, and
ccryptanalysis, my failure is not worth much, although others' is.)

No; it attests to the difficulty.  It proves that the problem defeats
at least some talented people.  This is evidence for the claim that it
will defeat all talented people, and even all people.

Unfortunately, it's the only kind of evidence we can get, barring
a complete theory of cryptanalysis being developed.  People can
demonstrate that certain kinds or classes of attacks are fruitless,
but to prove a cipher secure requires trying all possible attacks.
Do you think it's possible to enumerate them all?

It's the best evidence we can get.  Certainly it's better evidence
than exists for a cipher nobody has even tried.

The big thing with DES is that now the design decisions make sense.
Which means that it's less plausible that the decisions were made in
order to insert a back door.  That, and 15 years of determined civilian
attacks, is why I have some faith in it (as far as 56 bits of key
will go, of course).

A cipher can be attacked without being used, although there is indeed some
catch-22 in there; one motivation for an attack is the value of a
solution, and that only happens if a cipher is used in the real world.

As for the possibility of a secret solution to a cipher, if it is
breakable, then there is a chance that someone will break it NOT in
secret.  It is this chance which I rest my faith in ciphers on.

As I have repeatedly said, there is nowhere that I can get better
evidence, so I go with what I can get.

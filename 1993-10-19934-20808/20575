I'm hoping to get a sample of English text in machine readable form
to make trigraph and tetragraph frequency tables.  I could use ftp
or mail to get it.  It is important that the text be reasonably
'normal', that is, that the frequency of abbreviations and un-English
sounding proper names be fairly low.  It would be good if the text
was on more than one subject and not unusually redundant.

I currently am using the U. S. Constitution, but it is much too small
at around 50 KB.  It also is on only one subject and has a somewhat
resricted vocabulary.  The Caxton Foster book, _Cryptanalysis for
Microcomputers_, was compiled using the Brown Corpus, about 5MB of
text.  This sounds ideal.

Piecing together a sample from various net.sources would be fine, but
FAQ's of newsgroups and man pages are too full of abbreviations and
special terms, unless you expect to be solving cryptograms whose
plaintexts are of that sort.

I'm hoping to avoid copyrighted material.  I would also prefer to
stay away from anything likely to be offensive.

Hints of any kind would be appreciated.  Thanks.

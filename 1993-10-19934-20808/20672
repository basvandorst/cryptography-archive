A while back I was inquiring why there was no more voice
communication on my local police frequency. I was informed that they
must be using the MDT's much more than they used to. However we are
apparently able in Canada to apply to purchase them. There is
supposed to be a bit of red tape but it is apparently possible. I
was told this buy a local police officer.

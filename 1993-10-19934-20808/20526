     I know PGP when used with its RSA half if (virtually) unbreakable. But,
   how secure is the conventional half ( PGP -c )?

An analysis I posted a couple of weeks back shows that PGP's
conventional encryption is much, much more secure than its RSA half.
Many orders of magnitude more time is needed to break IDEA by exhaustive
search than is required to factorize even 1024-bit keys.  The RSA moduli
would need to be around 3100 bits to give comparable security, using the
best known algorithms.

All this assumes that dictionary attacks on the conventional key are not
feasible.

One thing I'd like to see is a zero-knowledge-type authentication
system which could be done mentally.  In the future, we will all
carry smart cards and pda's which will do our crypto protocols for us.
But how will we authenticate ourselves to them?  A 6-digit PIN?
I don't think so.  We need something that an eavesdropper/
overlooker can't break, but it has to be simple enough that it
can be done mentally.

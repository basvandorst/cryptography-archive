This is the second RFD for the sci.crypt reorganisation, which summarises 
the debate so far and provides an updated proposal.  The original RFD 
proposed the creation of a new group, sci.crypt.research, aimed at allowing 
the discussion of cryptography and cryptographic issues in an environment 
free of the type of noise which has been plagueing sci.crypt for the past 
year or two.  
 
The response was in general favourable, but a number of people thought that 
sci.crypt should be moderated instead of creating a new group.  However 
others (me included) were of the opinion that moderating sci.crypt would 
leave nowhere for postings which one person summed up as:
 
>    Does anyone have a Playfair cracker around?  My daughter has just
>    encrypted my grant application and won't decrypt it until I double
>    her pocket money!
>
>That is scarcely anything to do with state-of-the art research, cryptography
>politics, computer security or any of the other categories already catered 
>for.
 
The general consensus seems to be that we need some sort of moderated group, 
but not everyone agreed on sci.crypt.research.  A suggestion was made that a 
better solution to the problem would be to moderate sci.crypt, and to create 
a new group, comp.software.crypto for handling the traditional "Where can I 
get a free DES implementation/Is there a cracker for my WordPerfect file/
etc" type postings.  This seems like a workable compromise between the 
"Moderate sci.crypt" crowd and the "Create a new moderated group" crowd, 
since it creates a noise-free sci.crypt as well as leaving an open group for 
crypto-related messages which don't have any place in talk.politics.crypto 
or comp.security.misc.
 
The proposal therefore is:
 
 - Change the status of sci.crypt from unmoderated to moderated.  As I've 
   mentioned before I'll offer to act as one of the moderators, if anyone 
   else wants to help with this, let me know.
 
 - Create a new unmoderated group comp.software.crypto for general discussion 
   about software and all the other things which would probably be answered 
   anyway by reading the FAQ :-).
 
OK, flame away.... if anyone's got a better solution (I'm sure you all do 
:-), don't hesitate to let us know.
 
Peter.

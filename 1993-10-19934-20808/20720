It seems to me that pgp and other encryption programs leave individuals open
to suspicion by association.  E.g. ANY communication with a bank in Luxembourg
will trigger an IRS audit, etc.  Using a privacy/anonymity server will cause
suspicion in some government agency, and looks real bad in court.

So, we need to combine standard-file scripts and public key crypto, and provide
services which insulate sender and receiver.  This is an extension of the
privacy/anonymity server, with the advantage that any machine can
be used by any group which trusts each other.

The basic idea is to establish a public key for the crypto-relay service.  Then
fill out a form, including your encrypted message:

DESTINATION ADDRESS:  your_sensitive_target@somewhere.xxx
CRYPTO:				PGP		/* or any other public key crypto program */

DELAY:		4		/* 4 hours delay to foil traffic analysis */

/* now more spoofing of traffic analysis */
SPOOF ADDRESS:		your_friend1@his_address1.com
SPOOF PUBLIC KEY:	/* your_friend1's public key */
SPOOF ADDRESS:		your_friend2@his_address2.com
SPOOF PUBLIC KEY:	/* your_friend2's public key */
SPOOF ADDRESS:		your_friend3@his_address3.com
SPOOF PUBLIC KEY:	/* your_friend3's public key */
SPOOF ADDRESS:		your_friend4@his_address4.com
SPOOF PUBLIC KEY:	/* your_friend4's public key */
NUMBER OF SPOOFING MESSAGES:	4
/* the above cause 4 spoofing messages per address, filled with variable-length
   garbage, to be sent at random intervals */

MESSAGE: /* public-key encrypted message fills the rest of the file.  It
            is copied out by the script and relayed after the delay ends.
	      */

END:

You wouldn't want large, established relay/ cutout services, because they
would cause suspicion in the same way that the anonyity services might.
Also, the overhead of decrypting the script file, sending spoofing messages,
etc. could overload systems.

However, any group of friends could establish the service on any machine
connected to internet.

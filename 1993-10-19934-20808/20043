While it is true that obscurity itself does not provide adequate security,
it is not without its benefits.  As William Freidman states in his works on
cryptanalysis, the key to successfully breaking a message is to end up with
the plaintext message AND a set of logical assumptions which explain why the
message found is in fact the true message.

If I am given a 1K set of data and told to make sense out of it, it is going
to be a VERY difficult problem.  The hardest part is that I have to make
guesses about what encryption scheme is being used.  The guess I make is
going to determine the plaintext I end up with.  If I cannot justify the
first guess, I have not solved the cipher.  On the other hand, if the
ciphertext starts out ---DES-ECB---, I not only know exactly how to
proceed to crack the message, but when I get a plaintext, I will have a
much easier time justifying its correctness.

Of course, even more fun could be had by following Prop. II, and then
prepending the message with the name of a random cipher.  I.e, encrypt
with IDEA, and then stick ---DES_CBC--- on the front of the message.
Should be good to burn up a least a few MIPS out at Ft. Meade.

The slowness is just a side-effect of its design for chip densities
and architectures of the 60's and 70's. If the designers had room
for bigger tables and had optimized for software architectures
available (word rather than bit permutation, for example) then
it might very well be faster than another slower yet less secure
algorithm.

Conversely fast algorithms do not mean 'less security'.
For example, take an RSA system that computes the modular cube
of a value.  It is not easier to find the discrete logarithm for
that than a modular of a much higher number of a value.

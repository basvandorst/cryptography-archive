I recently bought a copy of Network Security Secrets, by David Stang and
Sylvia Moon (IDG Books, 1993, ISBN 1-56884-021-7).  Besides containing
a disk with a DES program, which is in flagrant violation of (and, according
to the editor I spoke with, in complete ignorance of) the IDEA, it is a
1200-page massive tome about security.  I have not read it all yet, but my
initial reactions are very mixed.

There is a lot of bad information here.  The stuff on public-key   
cryptography was lifted right out of RSADS's faq file.  As such, it is very
biased.  The discussion of access control and access control products only
looks at a few products, and it doesn't really analyze the security of
these products.  When I wrote my article on Mac security software for the
Feb 93 MacWorld, I tried to break all the programs I had.  The authors
didn't do anything like that.  There is also a lot of good information here,
though.  And the two high-density disks that come with the book are filled
with some really nice utilities.  I just wish there was some way to flag
the bad and misleading parts and steer people clear of them.

At $49.95, the book is a better deal than my book.  (I have to have a talk 
with Wiley:  500 more pages and two high-density disks for just $5 more
than my book.)  Look at the book at a bookstore before you buy it, but on
the whole I am glad I bought it.

Stream ciphers are studied much more intensively in Europe than in the United
States.  I have no idea.  Eurocrypt proceedings usually have a whole 
section of articles on the topic; Crypto proceedings sometimes have one.
Ranier Rueppel's ANALYSIS AND DESIGN OF STREAM CIPHERS (Springer-Verlag,
1986) is an excellent place to start.  (He's from Switzerland.)  Rueppel
also has a chapter on stream ciphers in Gus Simmons's CONTEMPORARY
CRYPTOLOGY (IEEE Press, 1992).  My book covers stream cipers to a limited
extent, but they get shorted in favor of block ciphers.

And the really odd thing is that stream ciphers are much more common in
military encryption products.  Go figure.

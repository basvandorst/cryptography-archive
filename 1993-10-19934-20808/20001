This is circumcising the mousquitto, Dave. A Grand Jury is mostly a rubber
stamp for the DA -- nobody seriously doubts this or expects a GJ to go against
the wishes of the investigating DA. All the real fact finding has most certainly
already been done -- the GJ testimonies are simply to try and get incriminating
testimony on the record.

I'm sure that when Phil Dubois asked the DA if his client was the target
of the investigation, the DAs answer didn't rule out Grady also being a
target. I'm even more of the opinion now that this entire action is an attempt
to harass PGP and Grady out of business. After talking with Dubois, who
has created a legal defense fund for Phil Z., I have a new appreciation
for the costs just to comply with subpoena's! Do you, for example, happen
to have an extra $100,000 lying around for legal fees? That's the minimum
that seeing this through will cost. I'm sure the DA knows this.

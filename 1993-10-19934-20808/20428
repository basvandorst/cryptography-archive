Hi gang,

A couple people have asked me if I'm speaking at a 
computer underground gathering in Austin this December.

No.  I won't be there. 

I will be speaking at Harper College in Palatine, Illinois 
on the evening of October 19th (it's near Chicago).
I'll also speak at a benefit for the Kensington Library
(just north of Berkeley, CA) on November 4 at 7:30.  
These talks are free & open to the public.  A splendid time
is guaranteed for all.

I'll also try to attend the Hacker's Conference at Tahoe as well,
but I'm uncertain if I can make that one.

You can finger my account stoll@ocf.berkeley.edu to confirm
these dates.

Cheers,
Cliff Stoll   stoll@ocf.berkeley.edu

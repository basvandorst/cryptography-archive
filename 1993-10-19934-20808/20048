   I'm looking for the documentation, but it's in a zillion boxes and my
bad back (myelogram yesterday) keeps me from searching.  However, it was a
question on my Novice class test; I had to identify the four countries on
the prohibited list at the time.
   Docs when I can get to them.  (Any ARRL people care to check the
archives on the prohibited list circa 1967?)

:at hand, in any case, was whether there are any such restrictions _now_.

   No, none at the moment; most of the countries that were on that list
now don't even allow ham radio any more.

:Obviously there may be restrictions in the future, if the appropriate regulations
:are created. Regulations banning virtually anything by any agency are always
:a future possibility. But those regulations DO NOT EXIST TODAY (if you think they
:do, please identify them). CURRENT regulations are the only thing germane
:to the analogy between supposed ham radio "restrictions" and restrictions
:on encrypted communications (which is where this all started).

   I lost my computer copy of Part 97 in a disk crash some time ago, so I
can't look there.  However, Phil Karn has already explained that the
regulations exist and are just not in use right now for lack of countries
to put on the list.

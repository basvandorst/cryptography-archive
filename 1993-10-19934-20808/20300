It depends on C. If C is a group, then C(...C(C(D))...) is equivalent
to C(D). Also, with some weak cyphers (or with some weak keys) C(C(D))
might result in the plaintext.

Which reminds me to ask the following question.

Is there a special name for the class of cyphers, for which encrypting
the cyphertext twice with the same key results in the plaintext? For
instance, the Unix crypt(1) is such a cypher, while DES isn't. The
cyphers that don't belong to this class require a special indication
of the mode they have to be run - encryption or decryption. Rot-13
belongs to this class, but the other Caesar cyphers on the Latin
alphabet don't.

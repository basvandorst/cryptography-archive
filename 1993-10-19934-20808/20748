         Cyberspace Democracy at the White House?

Jock Gill, the White House's communications expert in charge of
online services, declined to install eVote, software for voting in
cyberspace.  Mr. Gill called eVote "dangerous to democracy".

With eVote embedded into a newsgroup or other groupware, 
when a user enters a new topic, s/he is asked, "Would you like to
take a vote here?"  The user decides the details and eVote handles them.
At eVote's heart is an object-oriented vote-server and API.

Marilyn Davis, eVote's author, suggests that eVote be used for a 
"Tell Bill" conference in which we, the public, submit, discuss, and
judge our own compositions.  President Clinton responds to the
top scorer of the month.

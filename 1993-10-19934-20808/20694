Mooo.

	I am well aware that various gov't regulations prohibit users
	from outside the US from obtaining the DES algorithm from within
	the US, but I'm wondering that it includes Canada or not?

	I seem to recall reading various documents here and there that
	mention that Canadian users are allowed to obtain this, although
	my memory is well known for it's failures... :-)

	I'm living in the US currently, but if I move back to Canada, I'd
	like to know whether or not I'm allowed to take the security
	portion of my OS with me....


	Merci.

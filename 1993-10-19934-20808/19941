If a sequential search ALWAYS started with a specific guess and a
specific search sequence, say "aaaaaaaa", then the last logical
keyword, say "zzzzzzzz" would be best. Of course, nobody using an
exhaustive search attack will be so cooperrative. Consequently,
"aaaaaaaa" and "zzzzzzzz" are equally resistant to an exhaustive
search. Also, note these are clearly bad keywords in that they are
easily guessed patterns.

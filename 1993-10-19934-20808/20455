Most companies that handle classified information *do* take better
care of it that they do of standard corporate financial-statement stuff,
corporate phone books, etc.  I'd be *very* surprised if a company that
size could get caught being careless with classified information
and still get significant contract work; they'd get their ticket
punched pretty heavily.  But their own financials aren't the NSA's concern...

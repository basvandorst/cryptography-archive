      I have written a program that will perform a brute force search
      of the keyspace in 35 seconds on my 25MHz 486SX.

   I've written one which takes a 512-byte sample from the ciphertext; xors
   that with the rng's output and calculates the IC.  My prog. was written
   quickly, rather than written to run quickly, but it still takes only 4
   hours on a DEC 5000/25.  I could probably go several times faster if
   I tried hard,

      It seem that neither text is 7bit ascii.

   I agree with that.  Nothing spectacular in the IC output either.  Yet;
   my run is only 15% complete at the moment.

   Wonder what this stuff is.  A MessDOS FAT perhaps?  A GIF of the
   magazine's logo?  The compiled binary of his program under 2 different
   PC C compilers?

Maybe some sort of compressed archive format (zip/arc/what have you)..
which is why the IC tests didn't show anything useful..

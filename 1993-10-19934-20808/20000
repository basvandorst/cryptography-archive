If Dubois is his attorney, the legal defense fund is for his fees, so he is
not exactly a benefactor here.

All you have to do for the grand jury is show up with the requested files.
Since an attorney isn't permitted there, all you are paying for before an
indictment is some general advice. My guess is that most decent attorneys
will give that advice free, in anticipation that they will be retained IF
there is an indictment.

I still don't see that any case can be made that this is harassment. We DO
have munitions laws and the ITAR, and this is a legitimate grand jury
investigation. Even Phil himself knows, and has said in the PGP
documentation that the legal status of PGP is questionable in many cases.

If you don't like the laws, the path for change is Congress or the
administration, not complaints about a fact-finding investigation by those
charged with enforcing the laws we have.

Despite the enthusiasm of some, this is no Zenger case. In fact, it's not
yet even a case.

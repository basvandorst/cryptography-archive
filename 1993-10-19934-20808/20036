The problems with one-time pad is that :

1. you have to produce enormous amounts of keys  to all the messages you'll
encrypt,

2. you have    to have a   secure channel   to   distribute them  to   your
correspondent as it is a private key system.

PGP  (IDEA and RSA in fact)  are very far IMHO  from being easily broken as
you say... Look at what the NSA (and the US government) is  trying to do to
those who want to use strong crypto systems...

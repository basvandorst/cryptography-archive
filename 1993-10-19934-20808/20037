   Just as a sideline, any encryption program that uses a password to
generate a key should have a part that changes for each new message
(a "salt," though that's not the technical term for it), and the key
should be generated by a one-way hash like SHA or MD5.  This means that
even if the bad guys can break your key today, they get only one message
or file out of it, even if you use the same password every time.  (This
also keeps the attacker from getting too much ciphertext under any one
key, and also keeps the attacker from being able to make a one-time
huge dictionary of all likely password-generated-keys.)

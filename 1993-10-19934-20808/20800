I tend to think that you didn't quote it, because it proves you
wrong.

Wrong. What you said was:

As you can see, you said that it is being charged with Treason, not
that they are thinking about it.

First, it's not the three letter agencies, it's the Customs - at least
officially. Second, they are investigating him not for importing the
program, but for letting it being -exported-. I agree with you that
the US export laws on publicly available crypto software are
ridiculous, but those are the laws of your country - if you don't like
them - fight to change them.

If you have bothered to quote the message(s) you are replying to, you
would have seen that nobody claimed that DES is the best out there or
that it is unbreakable. You claimed that it is outdated, we said that
it is not. I maintain that it is not outdated, regardless that it is
within the current technology to build a DES cracker and regardless
that there are better cyphers out there.

Of course. But just because there are better languages than COBOL and
FORTRAN does not mean that they are outdated - exactly because they
are still widely used.

Partially, yes. The reason why they stick with it is because it is
*standard*. But, yes, it all boils down to money, because changing a
widely used standard is a costly operation.

It is significantly cheaper to switch to triple-DES instead to to
other cipher, and this is probably what we are going to see in the EFT
world in the near future.

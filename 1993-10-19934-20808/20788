I did and RSA confirmed that ViaCrypt has a license to their patent. They
mentioned something vague about problems with PGP but weren't more specific.

Now for the Mac version. Hope they do at least as good an interface as Ray
Lau did with MacRipem.

Now if ViaCrypt, Mark Riordan (Ripem) and Ray Lau, the Techmail people, and
RSA would only get together with the PEM types and standardize keys and
certificates we'd be all set. Right now MacRipem will take Apple's AOCE
(RSA) keys, but that's the only key compatibility I'm aware of.

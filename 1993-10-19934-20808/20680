Yes, it is a good one-time pad, since it is a one-time pad.  However,
the problem is that specifying "a random irrational number" requires
an infinite amount of information.

Asssume (without loss of generality) that your number is in the range
0 < x < 1.

Then it can be described by a digit sequence: (for example)

.0975483975840378017384765789435328754075238475904...

or a bit sequence:

.010001011111010101101010101101110101010001111110101...

Just put it in the same radix as your message and do an
addition-mod-radix on a digit by digit basis.

Hmm, sounds like a pretty good definition of a one-time pad to me.
The problem is that, in fact, even an arbitrary *integer* requires
infinite information to represent.  What you really want is a compact
representation; but whenever the key you have is shorter than your
message, you *will* reveal cryptoanalytic information.  Experts have
debated for years which way to minimize this leakage.

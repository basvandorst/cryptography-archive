Possibly a very good analogy but not a good argument for it.  In reality,
at least in California, the speed limits ARE supposed to be set by those
driving 80.  The law states that every so many years a given road is
required to be surveyed.  The results of this survey are supposed to
set the speed limit at the nearest 5mph increment to the 80th percentile
of the cars surveyed.  Now of course there are quite a few deviations from
that but in my opinion they fall into the same category, the Govt. is
being unjust for whatever the reasons may be.  The net result SHOULD be
that if that many people belive that speed limit is WRONG then perhaps it
should be changed.  I think that follows with what the Govt. is trying to
do and I think people need to do what they can to bring that to the
attention of enough people so the law gets changed or those in power get
changed.

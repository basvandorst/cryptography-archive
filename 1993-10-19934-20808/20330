I have just been reading Sir Harry Hinsley's new book `Codebreakers'. This
contains a lot of new material about Bletchley, including the first account
(so far as I am aware) of how the Colossus and its predecessor, the `Heath
Robinson', actually worked.

The idea was to do a correlation attack on the Schlusselzusatz, a stream
cipher device which was used with teleprinters. A large number of Boolean
functions of the keystream were calculated and accumulated, to see where
correlations would emerge. From these correlations, it was possible to
reconstruct the settings of the pinwheels which generated the keystream.

The book takes the form of a number of reminiscences by veterans. Some of
these are technical, and others relate to the organisation and effect of
the enterprise.

Sir Harry, who worked at Bletchley from 1939-46 and is the official historian 
of British intelligence in WW2, has kindly agreed to speak at our security 
seminar next Tuesday (19th October), which will be held at 1615 in room TP4, 
Computer Laboratory, Pembroke Street, Cambridge.

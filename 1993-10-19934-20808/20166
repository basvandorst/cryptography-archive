I have two Intel i860's each rated at 40MHz (PGA packaging.)

That's about it...I don't have any supporting electronics, just the chips.

I would like to sell them just to get rid of them, but I was hoping I could
somehow, and inexpensively I might add, utiltize their processing
capabilities. What boards are out there that could use both chips at once?

The only application I have for these (and i'm not even sure if they're
suitable) is encrypting strings for use in analyzing our password files.

If I can't find a use for these chips, I would like to sell them for any
reasonable offer. 

Please respond to 'torin@atitech.ca'.

Torin...

Your problem is orthagonal to the problem of distributing signed messages
across unsecure channels (all channels!). By distributing a verifier with
the script, you are vulnerable to a strip-and-re-sign attack. Forget
dissasembling your verifier--someone could substitute their own verifier!

My suggestion is to find a trustable (it likely won't be secure) way to
have end-users check signatures with *you*. Then you could go ahead and
publish the verifier's source code and algorithm!

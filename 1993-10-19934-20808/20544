I don't know if it is unduly paranoid, but certainly parts of it are just
plain wrong.

The only thing which is secret is the design principles NSA applied to the
S-boxes (the encryption tables you mention). There is absolutely NO evidence
that there is a trap-door in DES; all research (including my own) seems to
indicate that NSA modified DES to make it _stronger_, not weaker. No
modification of the tables has ever been found that significantly strengthens
DES; indeed, the S-boxes seem to be the best possible. Also, it is not and
has never been illegal to use DES or any modified version of DES (e.g.
triple DES, which is effectively a longer key). It is just that NSA gets
edgy when you try to sell or export something that does this. You can use
any encryption system you want, at least for personal use.

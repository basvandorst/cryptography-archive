One way comes to mind. Use a 32 bit Galois Field GF(2^32) using a 32 bit SR
with a dense primitive polynomial or the field of 32 bit unsigned integers.
Raise a fixed (or keyed) primitive element to the power given by the
byte modulo 2^32 using the binary algorithm. This is very cheap using
the SR for 32 bits. Then encrypt this 32 bit number using your key and
favorite encryption algorithm.

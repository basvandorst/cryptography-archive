Very true.

However, one could use RSA as the encryption method in much the same way
IDEA/DES is used (synchronous key).

Instead of :

	* generate a random IDEA key
	* encrypt content with IDEA key
	* encrypt IDEA key with recipient RSA public key

one could :

	* generate random RSA key pair
	* encrypt content with random RSA private key (block)
	* encrypt random RSA public key with recipient RSA public key
	
Recipient could then decrypt the random RSA public key with his/her RSA 
private key then decrypt the content with this.

This could be a very lengthy process though, depending on the size of the
random RSA key, the type(s) of primality testing done during the key pair
generation, the size of the content, etc...

Actually this assertion is arguable, if you merely mean coming up with
a strong cipher.

Consider encrypting blocks of 64 bits; this is equivalent to defining
a secret permutation of a deck of 2^64 cards, and there are on the
order of (2^64)^(2^64) of those.  In fact, there are on the order
of exp(sqrt(2^64)) equivalence classes of permutations with the same
cycle structure here.

Considering this staggering space of possible ciphers, the examples we
have of even "strong" ones are almost laughably simple in terms of their
internal state and key space.  For heaven's sake, DES has *fixed*
internal S boxes!  While it gets an impressive amount of bang for the
buck out of these, (and was equally clearly designed with planned
obsolesence in mind), it is not hard to believe that schemes
involving large key-dependant S-boxes and key-dependant bit permutations,
with absurd numbers of rounds would be quite secure.

And slow, and difficult to implement in fast VLSI...

Crypto research is not going to involve merely strong ciphers,
it will be directed at making very fast - but still secure - ones
and at adding functionality like "law enforcement fields" and other
special "features".

Which is all academic since the government will probably see to it
that the average citizen will not be legally entitled to any real
privacy in their communications anyway.

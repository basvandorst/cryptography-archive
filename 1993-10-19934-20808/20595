-> Does anyone know how to open a Quattro Pro for Windows file that
-> was saved with a password?

-> I have an old file that I do not remember the password to anymore.

A company by the name of AccessData sells a product that can recovery
the passwords for Quattro Pro locked files.  You can reach them at
1-800-574-5199 (or 801-224-6970).  They also sell password recovery
products for WordPerfect 4.2-6.0, Lotus, Excel, Paradox, MS Word,
Novell NetWare, and some others.

Hope this helps,

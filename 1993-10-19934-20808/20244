I asked this question in this group months ago and never got a response.
So I skipped over to a telcom group and got lost of responses :)

A5 is the crypto system used by GSM, the latest European DIGITAL cellular 
telephone standard.  Eventually, almost all EuroCellular will be encrypted 
with A5.

A5X is a degraded version which is alleged to be a lot easier to decrypt.
It was designed for 'export' to non-Nato countries.

BOTH ARE SECRET AND ARE AVAILABLE ONLY TO TELCOMS WHICH WILL SIGN
NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS.  The major US telcom supplier, for example,
had only a couple of programmers who had been allowed to see A5's internals.
It was believed none of their crypto aware people had been allowed to
see A5 (!!). (Steve?? you there??)

I suspect A5 will keep scanner builders from listening but I would bet
Richard Nixon's nose the NSA, GCHQ, KGB, JSA, Panasonic, etc. can all 
listen if they want.  It can't be too good as it doesn't have much resource 
to work with (ie. the GSM phone which contains no crypto-specific parts).

My nSWAG, non-Scientific Wild Ass Guess, is it is a pad which is xor'd.  
That would be easy to do and Telcom people might think it is secure.

(I wonder if A5X sends the pad as part of the message??? ;)

Hey folks, this is the kind of crypto Big Government will let us have without
sending grand juries on witch hunts :(

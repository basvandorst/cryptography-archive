There's nothing really _wrong_ with making your own do-it-yourself
private superencipherment that you share with a few friends.  There's
nothing very interesting about it either -- the interesting stuff is
protocols that can be used WITHOUT previous secure prenegotiation.

Of course you wouldn't want to tell them.  

Just don't go around assuming that they don't already know.

And don't go around assuming that you can design a cryptographic
protocol that doesn't mistakenly leak information, any more than you
should go around assuming that you can design a cipher that's
resistant to real attacks.

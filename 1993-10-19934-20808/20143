Okay, it'd be slow. Damn slow. But I'd like to see a switch to use RSA
encryption in place of the fast IDEA encryption. For that really
really secret note you want to pass.

Are there any plans to do this? Could you pass this on to someone
who'd know? (I don't have access to alt.privacy.pgp) Or, if anyone is
familiar with the code, how hard would it be to do? I'm a fairly
proficient C hack.

   Or am I missing something?

I think you may be missing something.  There are many ways of searching
a space sequentially.  It is not clear, in general, that you as a victim
will be able to predict the order in which keys will be tried by an
attacker.  For instance, suppose that I have a number of DES key search
engines which is relatively prime to 2^56.  To be concrete, let us say I
have a million and one of them.  I now pick a million and one random
starting points, with the constraint that each starting point modulo a
million and one is a different integer.  I then perform a linear search
on each machine, incrementing the key used by each machine by a million
and one between trials.  I cover the search space simply and
economically, but you are hard pushed to guess which part of it will be
searched early or late.

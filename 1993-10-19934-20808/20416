A very large number of sites don't receive any of the talk heirarchy
because it is perceived (and often correctly so) as not being mission
specific, i.e. not scientific and not worth the bandwidth.

I really believe it was a mistake to put it in talk and not comp.
Personally, I hope as much as possible stays in this group because my
own access to the talk group is difficult. No doubt many PC police
types will disagree.

You'll probably never get your code to run as fast as Urban's code,
Paul: a PC's long integer is a 32-bit quantity (while PC compilers
still sometimes use 16-bit ints, David Stafford's original code
explicitly uses a long for the seed and multiplier in the linear
congruential pseudo-random number generator), so the key space is 2^32
in size.  Being very optimistic and assuming that a 25MHz i486SX
completes a entire rng round per clock cycle, this gives:

% bc
2^32
4294967296
./25000000
171
%

An optimistic 171 seconds ~= 3 minutes != 35 seconds.  Something is
not kosher here. (!)

Either Urban is using a short cut, or his exhaustive key search
program isn't really exhaustively searching the entire keyspace.  Or
maybe he has a new 4-way issue version of the 486. :)

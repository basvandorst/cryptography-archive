You can exhaust all combination, but you can`t detect, what combination
is right!!!
After full exausting algorithm present to you 2^48 texts. You will select
one corect text. Some cryptoanalitic methods can select right text by
general begin ("Hello" or "Zdravstvuqte"). But good cryptosystems can
archive text before encryption. Thouse archivers must avoid "standart
parts" (for example headers) and surplus information (CRC and so on).

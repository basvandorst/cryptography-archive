	Unfortunately no.  That's why I am confused, I guess I should have
kept it crossed to sci.optics.  The papers are very short, and very
dense, so this was one of the ambiguities that I hoped someon could
explain.

	But interferometry seems to be able to propagate singles further
in single *node* fiber, or use multi*node* fiber.  I don't know why this
is so.

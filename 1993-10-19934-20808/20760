With thoughtful help from several people via Email, we located
the problem:  loose nut on the keyboard.  It turns out that
my path statement was pointing to PGP2.3 even though i was trying
to run 2.3a.

Thanks to all who helped.

Colin, i've erased all the messages with your address on them, but
i need to get your public key from you.  Please send me a copy.

Thank you,
j.

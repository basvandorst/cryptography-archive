I just called Philip on the phone 5 minutes ago (10/28/93, 15:30).
He is still undergoing the same legal hassles that have already been
discussed on then et ad infinitum, but he is definitely not in jail.
He was surprised to hear that someone thought he was in jail.
It didn't sound like there were any particular new developments
in his legal case either.  His being taken to jail would be a
most surprising development.

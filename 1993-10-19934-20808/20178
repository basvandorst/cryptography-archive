I disagree.  There needs to be a newsgroup for general cryptographic questions
and discussion (unless such use is to be forbidden :-) and it seems futile
to overload comp.security.misc.  Of course, I admit that cross-posting will
always happen between these two groups, but that doesn't alter my argument.
For example, where should the following posting go if sci.crypt is moderated?

    Does anyone have a Playfair cracker around?  My daughter has just
    encrypted my grant application and won't decrypt it until I double
    her pocket money!

That is scarcely anything to do with state-of-the art research, cryptographic
politics, computer security or any of the other categories already catered for.

Given the vastly wider (and more general) audience of the net in the 1990s
compared with even the 1980s, having low-traffic, moderated sci.XXX.research
groups helps the specialist without obstructing the interested layman.

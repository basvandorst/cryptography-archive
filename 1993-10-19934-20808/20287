It doesn't. But if registration is required and if this registration
is exactly the same, regardless whether you are a dentist or a
shoemaker, then when you are told to register, it doesn't matter as
which of the two you are told to register.

But it does. Look at the Yellow Pages sometimes. You'll see that the
dentists and the shoemakers are listed in separate sections.

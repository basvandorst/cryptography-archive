Hi,

I am working as a software designer in a university hospital where I manage
laboratories. Here, as we are moving toward some more and more open and
integrated applications, the need to authentify data and to protect a few
confidential ones is growing. I am interested in getting a general background
in this area. Do you have a few good references about the state of the art
in these two domains? I would like to learn the general principles of
authetification and cryptograpy. I would also like to learn what is currently
practically used and what will be in use in the following years.

Thank you very much in advance.

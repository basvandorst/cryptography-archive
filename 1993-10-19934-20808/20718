I am chairman of the Chaosgruppe, a non-profit-organisation that sponsors
research and educational activities in nonlinear dynamics. We have also
a small library where we want to collect all significantly interesting papers
in this field. At the moment I want to focus on papers that deal with
methods distinguishing deterministic chaos from noise.
Though this is a more or less general problem I am looking forward to any
hints, even if you think I should already know the paper or the method.

If possible, please send BibTeX-entries.
I will post a summary of the results in sci.nonlinear

Thanks in advance,
Werner Eberl,

Hi there,

I'm trying to find out if there is any other algorithm(s) besides RSA that
can be use to implement a public-key cryptosystem.  I'm not sure if some form
of exponential key-exchange methods like Diffie-Hellman as described in Sun's
manuals would do the trick.  If such methods do exist, I would like to know if
there're public-domain implementation(s) of such technique(s).

Any info/pointers would be much appreciated.

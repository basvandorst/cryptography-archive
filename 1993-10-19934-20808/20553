Apparently the cases used as the basis for the book are real ones. The
Tamam Shud one is from South Australia in the 1940s or something. The book
is called something like "Case Reopened" and is a collection of fictional
explanations of real unsolved cases including the disappearance of Harold
Holt.
The code referred to at the start of this thread was supposed to have
been solved bya  friend of the author of this story in the book. I don't
know what it said as she didn't tell Phillip Adams this in the interview
on Late Night Live; I imagine she wants us to buy the book.

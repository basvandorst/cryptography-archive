Name: sci.crypt.research
 
Charter: To allow the discussion of cryptography and cryptographic issues in
         an environment free of the type of noise which has been plagueing
         sci.crypt for the past year or two.
 
Status: Moderated
 
In the last few years to signal to noise ratio of sci.crypt has become
progressively worse, scaring away many of the previous sci.crypt regulars.  The
level of the postings to the group has steadily declined from useful details on
current research, algorithms, implementations, and informed comment, to endless
wrangling about US export restrictions, the Clipper/Capstone chips, key escrow,
the first amendment, NSA conspiracies, and whatnot.  The appearance of
talk.politics.crypto has alleviated this problem only slightly.
 
I therefore propose the creation of sci.crypt.research in an effort to restore
the status quo to what it was a few years ago.  Despite many, many requests
from people to keep the noise out of sci.crypt, this has not happened, so the
new group will be moderated.  However cryptography being the contentious issue
that it is, there may be an advantage to having more than one moderator.  Here
are some recent comments I made during a discussion in sci.crypt:
 
>I can moderate it if there's a demand for sci.crypt.research.  Since I'm
>located in a country which doesn't generally get intimidated by the US govt,
>and whose branch of the NSA don't even like to admit they exist, there's
>little chance of any problems.
> 
>However since the principal task of any moderator will be to act as noise
>filter, how about having multiple moderators with people submitting postings
>to whoever's closest, much like the submission process to the editors of

>reasonably uniform standard of junk rejection I can't see any problems, and
>there could be advantages to having at least two moderators, one in the US and
>one in a location free of any US govt. influences.
 
What the moderation would entail is, as I see it, the filtering out of non
crypto research related noise such as anything related to the issues mentioned
above, leaving only the core of useful information which it's become so hard to
find in sci.crypt recently.  The purpose of the moderation isn't so much to
restrict posting but rather to allow posting in a noise-free environment.
 
Peter.

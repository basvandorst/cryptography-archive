I am about to release a signature scanner that uses MD4 and MD5.  With
it will be a list of application signatures to check your stuff against.
It will have C source for it, MD4, and MD5.  It will also have several
documentation files and a MS-DOS executable.

I want to confirm that this is legal to do as this program will be
freeware.

Thanks in advance, and please E-mail to keep the bandwidth for other
articles.

According to ITAR Canada is indeed exempt from most munitions licensing
requirements, but at a minimum you will still need a 'SED' (Shipper's
Export Declaration) citing the chapter and verse of the exemption attached

And remember it's not just 'DES' it is ANY privacy algorithm, technical
assistance, or whatever that falls into the rather broad crypto
category.

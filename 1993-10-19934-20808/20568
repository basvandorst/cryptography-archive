One million and counting....

The RSA-129 project has just passed the one million relations mark.

As of 5am UT, Wednesday 20 October 1993, hot-spare.mit.edu had
received 1030805 relations.  These are distributed as follows:

      14263 full relations (fuls)
     182353 partial relations (pars)
     834189 double partial relations (pprs).

The full relations are usable as they stand.  The pars and pprs have
to be further processed to find cycles.  So far, we have 1679 cycles.

When the sum of the fulls and the cycles reach 524400 we are almost
done.  A few hours work on a workstation, followed by some heavy
crunching on a MasPar and we will know the Ultimate Answer (and I will
be most upset if it turns out to be 42 :-)

The number of cycles might seem to be disappointingly small.  However,
the number of cycles per par and per ppr grows quadratically with the
number of relations collected.  We had fewer than 100 cycles in from
the first 250k relations; we now have 20 times as many cycles from
only four times as many relations.

Because we still have relatively few cycles, it is difficult to give
an accurate estimate of how much further we have to go.  However, I
can give a guestimate which won't be too far out.  We know from
previous large-scale runs of MPQS, that the final total consists of
about 20% fulls and 80% cycles.  As we need something over half a
million altogether, we can divide the number of cycles by one
thousand, and call that the percentage completion.  Accordingly, my
best estimate is that we are about 14% done.

As more machines come on-stream, we are collecting more and more
relations per day.  During October, we have averaged 24247 relations
per day, with a peak of 31162 last Sunday.  Machines tend to be more
idle at the weekend; this shows up quite clearly in our statistics.
It is difficult to determine exactly how many machines are
contributing; certainly many hundreds.  Even more would be nice, of
course!  What I can say is that we have allocated over 9000 UIDs so far.

The following is also very rough and ready.  My DEC 5000/25 generates
one relation per 1100 seconds on average, and is rated at 15MIPS or
so.  Therefore, 24000 relations per day corresponds to an *average*
compute power of 4600MIPS.  That's a powerful supercomputer by most
people's standards.  Almost all of this computation comes from machine
time that would otherwise go to waste.


So, a big thank you to everyone who has contributed to the project so
far.  Your help is much appreciated.  Anyone reading this who has not
joined in yet, is invited to send email to rsa129-info@iastate for
more information.  All you need is a Unix box with at least 8Mb of
memory, some idle cputime, and a desire to join in the largest single
computation currently taking place anywhere on the Internet.

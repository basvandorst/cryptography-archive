I think that it would become obvious after a little while if one player was not
disclosing real die rolls.   I think there would probably be other correlates in
the way he/she played to lend weight to, or detract from, any conclusions about
their 'honesty'.  If you _really_ wanted to check it out, couldn't you simply keep
a record of each player's individual die face observations, and encourage any
others able to do so to do likewise?  After a few weeks of play a simple frequency
count or histogram would make any skew in the distributions rather obvious.

I think this is probably unneccesary, there's nothing wrong with trusting honesty....

Jon.

Dear Folks,

	The solution called crypto drivers, kernel level
encryption/decryption disk driver, sounds like a strategy for
maintaining data integrity against the (unlikly) problem of
having one's disk stolen. What I've seen proposed thus far
provides protection against nothing other than that.

	Both NFS and RFS transfer streams at application level,
ergo, plaintext. The plain-text would be available to any and
all present detection methods every time the disk was accessed.
Floppy discs would undoubtedly be secure provided the driver
allowed individual keying.

	It doesn't sound like plug and play, to me.

	Shalom,

	JBB.

Hmm, perhaps Mike Wingeier is the greatest living cryptanalyst.  He says DES has
a back door.  Mike: prove it.  Rumor doesn't cut it in science.

The way the game is played is thus.  Most people say DES does not have a back door.
That is a falsifiable assertion.  You claim it does (you are attempting to
falsify the assertion), yet you provide no evidence.  Until you provide the 
evidence the right thing for the community to do is to ignore you as a crank
(which I would be doing, if it weren't Saturday morning and I wasn't avoiding
mowing the lawn).

It all depends on how hard you are willing to try. I know a person who
used to work for a company in Roumania, that was in the business of
cracking CAD systems. For some unknown reason, the CAD systems use
dongle protection very often, so the people there have become rrather
experienced in removing it. Sometimes they used even to get disabled
demos of the products (which contained all the code in them, but large
parts of it was disabled), then re-enabled them and sold the pirated
copies.

A friend of mine in Bulgaria once managed to crack a dongle protected
CAD system that used to do something like the above (the program kept
part of its code encrypted, not the data files) without even having
the dongle! But that was because the encryption was laughable. In most
cases, you need at least a copy of the dongle, in order to break the
protection. But it is always breakable, provided that you are willing
to spend enough efforts on it. And those efforts tend to be pretty
cheap in Eastern Europe or in the Far East...

Anyway, this has nothing to do with encryption; maybe we should move
to comp.security or something like that.

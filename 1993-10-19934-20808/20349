I got a copy of MacPGP2.3.cpt.hqx.gz from the ucberk server,
but after using gunzip and mcvert the filename is MacPGP2.3.cpt
and I can't do a thing with it!

A) How do I get this file to work as an application on my Mac?

  or

B) Does anyone have a working Macintosh copy they could upload?

email me!

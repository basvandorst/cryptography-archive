It's been ported to just about anything (well, the number of "just
about anything"s keeps growing rapidly, but....), including DOS, Unix,
Mac, Amiga, and people will probably start porting it to NT and things like
the Apple Newton as soon as they can (may need a C compiler first?,
and having the hardware around helps a lot too :-).  The Casio/Tandy
Zoomer is only 8086-clone based, but it may be portable there;
I don't know what you'd do for the Sharp Wizard but that may be a bit
too small....  In the other direction, it's probably been ported to Crays,
and the (Unix) port to the Integraph Clipper processor was a nice touch.

	I see that your address is not a university. You may not be
aware of the concerted attack on free speech currently popular with
university administrators. Many employees and non-tenured faculty
members don't wish to tempt fate at this time. Read Upton Sinclair's
book 'The Goose Step' and you may understand some of the chilling
history of speech and idea suppression that still exists in many American
Universities even 'now'.

	Shalom,

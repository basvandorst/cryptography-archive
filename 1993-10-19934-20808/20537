The correlation between slowness and security is not very reliable.  I've
seen some really slow algorithms that were very insecure.  I've also seen some
very fast (in hardware) algorithms that were very secure.  I look forward to
finding out more about Seneca, especially if it is something that can be 
exported to the USA :-).  I personally don't think DES is secure enough for 
all the applications that it is used for.

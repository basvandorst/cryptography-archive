This is called a running-key cypher. The method of solution is roughly
as follows:

For each byte of cypher-text, there are at most 26 pairs of plaintext
and key letters that can generate it (I'm assuming here that you only
use letters; only the detail matters if you use all the characters). If
you use XOR, there are often less; if you add modulo 26, there are
always 26. These pairs can be placed in frequency order. Then you solve
the cypher rather like a monoalphabetic: try the most probable letters
first (equivalent to trying E for the most common letter), and try to
construct words around them. Basically, you solve both texts (the
message and the book) at the same time.

For those in doubt as to the feasibility of this, it is conceptually
very similar to multiple anagramming for solving transpositions, which
has often worked in the real world.

[And, no, I don't want to try one for myself. I'm no expert; I got this
out of Kahn plus basic logic.]

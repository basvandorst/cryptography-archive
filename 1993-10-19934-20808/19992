I'll admit to being somewhat of a Unix newbie, so I might be missing
something, but I don't get why using longer passphrases would require
changing more than the passwd program.  It seems to me (and many
people have mentioned this), that all you need do is use a good hash
to shorten the long passphrase down to the 8-bytes or whatever the old
password uses, then encrypt the hash by the normal means.

 The big mistake that men make is that when they turn thirteen or fourteen and
 all of a sudden they've reached puberty, they believe that they like women.
 Actually, you're just horny. It doesn't mean you like women any more at
 twenty-one than you did at ten.                --Jules Feiffer (cartoonist)

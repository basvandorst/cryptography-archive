-I read about this in the weekend papers [either the Weekend Australian
-or the Courier Mail on Saturday 9'th Oct] It was stated that "Tamman Shad"
-means "the ultimate end" or words to the effect. Not knowing arabic [or
-ancient persian] I can't confirm or deny it.

   Well, I haven't been to Iran since the Shah was bumped outta there,
and my Farsi wasn't all that strong when I did live there, but I seem
to remember Tamman shad (I think pronunced ta-'mam shoud) did mean
"finished" or "that's all". I could go home and look it up, I suppose.

Well, I can prove to you that it's possible, but this
isn't how I'd do it....

You're describing a client-server architecture, where
the client accepts input from the user, changes its
internal state, and then send a message to the server.

The server can verify that the client is behaving
correctly by having the client forward everything that
it gets as input, and the server can verify that
given that input, the output that the server receives
is correct.  (In essence, you're running a "correct"
client at the server, and making sure that it produces
the same output that the client in question is 
producing.) 

Now, that's definately not the best way to do this,
but depending on the appliciation, it may be possible
to dumb it down some, so that the server doesn't keep
total track of the internal state of the client, but
can detect when something illegal is about to happen.

This only helps to solve a class of this sort of
problem.  In general, it isn't possible to verify that
a program is the same one that you distributed.  Heck,
even if it were, somebody familiar with a debugger
could run the real program, but cheat by changing
internal values in the program, calling various routines,
etc....  The program itself would still be the same, but
the execution that you'd get out of it would be completely
different.

Oh yeah.  The usual disclaimers apply here.

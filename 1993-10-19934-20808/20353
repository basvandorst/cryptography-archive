Vesselin:
: Where does the number 1024 come from? A 8-bit variable can have only
: 2^8=256 different values. If you keep a table of 256 elements (each 32
: bits and sorted), then a binary search of at most 8 attempts should 
: result in the desired value.

Mea Culpas.  For some reason I was thinking of 2^10, rather than 2^8.
At any rate, the point about the ease of brute-force search remains
(even stronger, I guess).

In case anyone cares, I made a minor error also in my suggested
function.  I had it thought of correctly, but I typed it quickly.  The
point is just that the second "round" of bit-definition needs to step
backwards through the bits in the first round.  Of course, I might
still be missing something not quite so painfully obvious:
  ***********************************************************
As to an answer, I suppose an easy way to make such a function, where
keys of (more than) 32-bits are used would be:

      Define f(M) --> C       ; 8bits --> 32bits

      for M=m1...m8; C=c1c2...c32; K=k1...k32...;
              X=MMMM=x1...x32; I(intermediate)=i1...i32
      define c0 and i0 as you like, i.e. zero or one.

      Let i(n) = i(n-1) xor x(n) xor k(n)
      Let c(n) = c(n-1) xor i(33-n) xor k(n)
                              ^^^^      ^^^^-- this could be k(n+32)
                  correction --^                 (If a key of up to
                                                  64-bits is desired)

Yours, Lulu...

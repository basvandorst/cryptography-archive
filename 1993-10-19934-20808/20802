Why does DES even need a back door?  With a big enough battering ram the 
front door seems to come off its hinges fairly easily.  Such a battering
ram isn't even that expensive and when you amortize its cost out over
a whole bunch of raids on the potentially profitable data of other people
and other companies it might turn out to be a real bargain.

Go mow your lawn.  :-)

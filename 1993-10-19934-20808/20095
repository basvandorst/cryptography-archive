How can I prevent the enemy from getting a copy of the PEM RFC, which
is what we're discussing?  The RFC has to be specific enough so that
people who have it can communicate securely among each other; the only
thing that you have to keep secret is your private key.

The opposition could sometimes be one of your other correspondents.
For PEM, assuming you could keep the system secret is stupid, because
everybody has to be able to use it.

Then you must have previously negotiated the algorithm with your
correspondent, over a secure channel.  The whole point of public-key
cryptography is that you don't even need a secure channel to exchange
keys with.  The Internet is not a secure channel.

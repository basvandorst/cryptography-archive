The program was a channel 4 one, part of the Dispatches series. It was about
what the NSA facility at Menwith Downs in Yorkshire England is used for. The
program followed a group of women (some of whom may be grannies) who have
regularly climbed the fences and wandered about the base and buildings.

As long as they do no damage and leave when asked to they are not committing 
any crime.

Another part of the program perported to show a normal sat disg with some
extra radio scanner hardware listening in to trans-atlantic phone calls.

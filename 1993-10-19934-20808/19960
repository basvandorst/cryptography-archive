The neatest trick I've seen to hide information in picture files is by  
suboptimally compressing them.  Say you're using a simple run-length encoding.   
If instead of saying "13 pixels of color A", you say "8 pixels of color A, then  
5 pixels of color A", you have conveyed some data without altering the visual  
properties of the picture at all.  Not much bandwidth, and unless you're  
trickier than my simple description it would stick out like a sore thumb on an  
automated scan, but the potential is certainly there.

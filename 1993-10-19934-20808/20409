Subject: Re: Pencil and paper encryption algorithm
Lines: 15

I agree with Richard Roberts that the pencil and
paper algorithm is subject to human error. 

I am wondering what the purpose of a pencil and
paper algorithm is in today's computer age? If
there is a real purpose for designing such algorithms,
then if the actual implementation is on a computer, the
human error is not a problem.

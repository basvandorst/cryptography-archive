Easy. Those that want to connect with the freeware
PGP users, but who are concerned with the !@#$%^&* 
legal issues.

Litigation eventually would make or break the market,
with little investment on ViaCrypt's part as far as
software development goes.

I would hope that their interface is somewhat less
cumbersome. I could see a small front-end that 
would just pass on the menu selections to the 
existing PGP code, however.

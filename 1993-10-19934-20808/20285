AFAIK, nobody knows it for sure, but the answer is very probably 'no'.

So just do an MD5 hash of the password first. This will give you 128
pretty regularly distributed bits, if MD5 is any good...

First, no known-plaintext attacks on IDEA are known. Second, It's
still better to have 9 known bits, instead of the whole message with
known letter frequency. Third, compression will save space.

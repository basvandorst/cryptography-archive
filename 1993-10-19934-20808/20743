Seems to me that it shouldn't.  The overhead of encrypting/signing would
be borne by the sender, and decrypting/validating by the receiver. 
Moving an already-encrypted message around the net shouldn't be
noticeably more expensive than moving plaintext; bytes is bytes.

PGP signature blocks do add some length to the messages, but they're
short enough that I'd hesitate to call it "great" extra overhead.  Long
.sigs are probably a greater menace.

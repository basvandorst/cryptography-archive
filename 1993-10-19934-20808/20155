I'm totally new to these things, but I have a question:
I also read that having only 7 or 8 characters would be enough to find
the DES key. Now the real question: A friend told that his company
wants to crypt the harddisks of their PC's with DES, to prevent
that third parties would get information from a PC (possible
notebook) that is stolen. I figure that if you make guess on the DOS
version they use (e.g. 5.1) you have almost the total boot-sector as
"plain text" available. Does this mean that finding the key get's
even easier (you know almost 500 characters _and_ their position)?
This would mean that crypting the total harddisk would not prevent
someone who _really_ wants to get the information from doing so...
How long would it take to find the key?

Thanks in advance!

In the late 60's I got to see a paper-and-pencil cipher that
appeared to be quite strong. It was a sort of one-time pad
cipher, but the key material was not random, but generated
from the phone numbers in the telephone directory for the
city of Oslo.  As far as I remember it worked something like this:

The sender would select at random a page in the directory and
and an entry on that page. The page and entry information was
encoded with a different system based on a table and the result
made up two 5 figure groups that were inserted in the message at
a given position.

Only the 5 least significant digits of the phone numbers were
used and the numbers were selected using a number sequence that was
derived from a poem. Hence if the number sequence was 3,7,2,9,8,6,5,1
etc. the sender would pick the third, seventh, second number etc.
from the starting position. Another number sequence, also derived
from a poem, was reduced modulo 5, to generate a sequence like
3,2,0,3,4,1,2, etc. This sequence was used to indicate the cyclical
shift applied to the 5 digits in the number. If the phone number was
59209 it would be 09592 after a cyclic shift of 3.

The reason for these two extra operations on the phone numbers was not
to generate 'more' randomness to the numbers, but to increase the
key space such that a brute force attack using the correct phone
directory would fail.

The operations were fairly straight forward and to generate a moderate
amount of key material was releatively fast. As there were no
difficult arithmetic operations involved it was rare that errors were
made during key generation. The only important point was to make sure
that you did not get out of sequence when picking numbers and performing
the cyclic shifts. Therefore these two operations were done one after
the other. First all the numbers needed were selected and written down
in columns with sufficient space to the right to fill in a column
with the shifted numbers, and then the shifts were performed. After the
shift operation the columns with the original numbers were crossed out
to be sure that you did not pick one of these numbers during the 
final ciphering operation on the plaintext.

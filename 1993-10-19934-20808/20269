When I say GSM doesn't have much resource to work with, I mean the GSM
phone has relatively little compute power and has no crypto-specific
chips in its design.  These phones are designed to be cheap with the minimum
amount of electronics possible.

Thus, however they implement A5, it will HAVE to be relatively simple.  
This leaves little possiblility of really secure crypto.

I suspect the claims of GCHQ that it would take serious effort to
break A5 is just so much disinformaton.  (The British press is noted
for being a major disinformation source.)  

Remember, the SigInt folks think any crypto that keeps them from reading
traffic in real time is too strong!  Maybe that's GCHQ's real complaint.

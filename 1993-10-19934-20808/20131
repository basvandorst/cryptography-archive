"Embodiment..."  Give it up.  If it looks like a duck, quacks like a duck,
etc., if it is a protected species, it is still protected during duck
hunting season.  (Do I win the prize for worst metaphore?)

It's still a valid arguement, and I noted that State doesn't seem to
recognize the existance of Public Domain Technical Data.  In court, they
would have to explain why that description is there, if there is no such
thing.

This thread doesn't really belong anywhere, but I think we are partial
agreement.  You seem to be stating that what I consider a sensible posture
in regard the law-as-written is subpeona-bait.  I agree, but I am glad that
someone is willing to take that posture, because the law is *wrong* (IMHO).
However, I don't think the Justice's position is compatible with common
sense (I realize, that has nothing to do with the law), the Constitution,
or the State Department's position; hence I hope that someone is willing to
challenge it.  (As such, if Grady wins, a malicious prosectution suit could
be brought).

BTW, your "continuing to work the issues" seems incorrect.  Nothing you are
doing that you have stating seems helpful even in _clarifying_ the issues.

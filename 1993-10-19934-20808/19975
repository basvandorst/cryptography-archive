  If someone(s) would be so kind as to post some articles from _common_
source that deal with the Clipper chip or Skipjack and any other article
that deals with privacy (especially e-mail) _or_ the degree of privacy in
mail (you know, paper&envelopes).  I would really appreciate it (and so
would my teacher) FYI IYC(If You Care) I'm in 9th grade at Dulaney High in
Baltimore, MD.

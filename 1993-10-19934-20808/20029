Assume that you have a strong cipher that takes a key (say DES, if that
is good enough).  You encrypt your password and the sector number to
give a secondary key, and use that to encrypt the contents of the sector.
This reduces your problem to that of finding an adequately strong and
fast cipher in the first place.

You can skip the first encryption, but it closes one possible loophole
for a negligible cost.

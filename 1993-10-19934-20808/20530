I found this in _Aviation_Week_ magazine, one of the
premiere publications for hardware loving warmongers.

(For example, in the last 3 months AW disclosed the
details of a test of a non-nuclear EMP [electromagnetic
pulse] weapon that was wildly successful, so much so
that it accidentally and unintentionally fried the
electronic ignition systems of 200+ automobiles in
a nearby parking lot.  Design details of how it worked
and how it was built, were also discussed.
Most distressing).

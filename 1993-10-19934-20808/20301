First of all, adding the noise will not, in itself, form any type of secure
cryptosystem.  If the intended recipient can figure out what constitutes the
real message, the spooks will be able to as well.

That having been said, there is _a little_ value added by dilution of a
message with random gobbledygook.  For example, if one were to pad every
byte of a message with seven bytes of random junk DES would probably be
extremely hard to crack since all known-plaintext methods would fail and
differential approaches would be pretty messy as well.  Unfortunately,
making the cyphertext eight times as big is pretty expensive, and there
are cheaper ways of getting comparable (or better) security.

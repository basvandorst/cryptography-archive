   Yes, they're using one-time pads.  It's mentioned in the FAQ.

   A one-time pad is a perfectly normal hand-ciphering method; it works
   just fine, but you have to have one page of key material for every
   page of text that you want to send, [...].

Basically, if you have a channel that's maintained over time, and the
data being protected is worth the trouble and risk of distributing the
key pads (the obvious weak spot), the one-time pad is great. For
example, I remember a photo of pads of key material hidden in
false-bottom ashtrays, alleged to have been found at the home of a
Communist cell member in the 50's (probably saw this in
_The_Codebreakers_).

It is interesting and fun to think of clever ways to distribute pads,
but I suspect that in the real world they are just done with the usual
spy drop methods.

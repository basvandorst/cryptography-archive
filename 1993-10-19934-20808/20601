I'm new to this newsgroup and I was just wondering something. I've been
using PGP for awhile and the last version I have is v2.3 which has a June
13th date on it. I was wondering what was the difference between 2.3 and
2.3a because I had heard rumors running around about a possible version of
PGP being circulated which made have had it's encryption routines altered
so that it would be easier to crack, so I've naturally been leary of using
new versions that may have intentional holes in it.

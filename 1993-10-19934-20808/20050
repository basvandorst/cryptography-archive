Your speed comparison between IDEA and DES software is wrong.  On a
486/50, my optimized software implementations of both go at about
300kbytes/sec.  Your mileage may differ, but there will never be a
huge difference.  Look at the complexity of the rounds; DES requires
a few table lookups and XORs, IDEA requires modular multiplications.

I suggest that you have a good look at Ralph Merkle's Khufu; there
are some similarities with your approach.

Andrew.

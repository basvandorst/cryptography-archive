Discussions related to crypto as it relates to policy, legality, morality, 
conspiracy, or rights do not belong in sci.crypt.  The only discussions
that are appropriate for sci.crypt are solely technical/scientific in
nature (that is why the name begins with "sci").  Ambiguous postings belong
only in talk.politics.crypto.

Please use the Followup-To: field to redirect followups to appropriate
newsgroups (e.g. talk.politics.crypto).  

In future, please post non-technical articles only to places such as
talk.politics.crypt and never to sci.crypt.

Thanks.

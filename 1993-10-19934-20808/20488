No, the first example of machine encryption working on the individual
elements of the Murray teleprinter code (5 bits) must have been Vernam's 
cipher which XORed each element with the elements of a key tape. But the
cipher machine that really performed transformation of the teleprinter
code elements was the Siemens Schlusselfernschreibmachine T52 that first
performed an XOR operation on each element and then transposed the different
elements.

I don't think the lessons learned from the cryptanalysis of the Enigma
would have helped anything for the attack on the Schlusselzusatz SZ40/
SZ42. The two machines are completely different and the team that worked
on the Enigma was not directly involved in the attack on the SZ machines.

William T. Tutte's feat of recovering the  wheel-patterns from  only
one long key sequence is indeed impressive.  As far as I know BP did not
posses any information about the internals of the SZ machines. For the
Siemens T52 there was a patent (it was even patented in USA) that explained
the principle, but the SZ40 was never patented.

But Tutte was not alone in delivering such an impressive act. In Sweden
Professor Arne Beurling attacked successfully both the Siemens T52 a,b,c
and d machines and the SZ40. Recent research shows that the Swedes built
at least two copies of the SZ40 machine.

I am presently trying to learn more about Arne Beurling's cryptanalytical
work.  If anybody have any further information about the attack on these
machines please contact me by email: frode@dxcern.cern.ch.

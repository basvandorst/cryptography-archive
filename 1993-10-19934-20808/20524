   As an extension to the FAQ, may I suggest that a few conventions 
   are agreed upon and that certain FTP sites maintain a directory 
   of programs that can be used for analysis of crypto products.  
   Then, when the perennial question comes up, the tyro can be 
   referred to a set of tests that s/he should test their idea 
   against.

   Amongst the conventions to be set up would be the source language 
   for the analysis programs (probably C) and an interchange file 
   format for files of random numbers, plaintext etc.

   Advantages would include an improvement in the general level of 
   'crypto literacy' as well as improved crypto products in the 
   marketplace.  Successful ideas could be then aired on sci.crypt 
   are more subtle forms of cryptanalysis developed.

   Comments anyone?

Nice ideas.  Who is going to do all the hard work?

Does the US government have rules on what kind of cryptanalytic tools
can be let out of the country?

      Depends on how much work the "dongle" does.  If you actually put
part of the algorithm inside the "dongle", replacing it without rewriting
the program can be difficult.  For example, if you encrypt the program's
data files, and do all the encryption/decryption in the "dongle" itself,
doing without the "dongle" will not be possible unless you can crack
the encryption algorithm, or are willing to rewrite the program to use
an incompatible file format.

      The ultimate dongle is requiring a proprietary computer, like
Intergraph used to do, but that approach is out of favor.

I beleive that the _original_ PGP is for PC machines, but in the 
documentation, there is a section where he thanks certain people for 
compiling it for the Amiga and other Software/computers. UNIX was in there, 
and there is a small section on how to configure it for UNIX.  

SO to stop my rambling on, I'll say. 'Yes' there is PGP for a UNIX based 
system.

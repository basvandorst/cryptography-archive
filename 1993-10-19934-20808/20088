YET ANOTHER REASON TO OPPOSE GATT!!!!!

Americans, don't let your freedom of speech be stolen!

What's the problem?
-------------------
 
The United States of America have restrictions on the export of weapons and
munitions. (ITAR or International Trade in Arms Regulations).
This is a good thing because otherwise every person in the U.S.A.
could sell nuclear bombs to Cuba. 

Unfortunately, some utter nut at the NSA decided to make cryptographic
devices and even *software* equivalent to munitions. Note that software is
nothing but information, so the right to disseminate information is
affected by this decision. It does not just apply to so-called classified
information, even programs that are publicly available or that you write 
yourself or that you got from another country, are affected. 

Making cryptographic software equivalent to munitions is just as foolish as
making addictive crossword puzzles equivalent to drugs. Imagine that
newspaper editors were put in jail for drug trading, just for a crossword. 

Why is this bad?
----------------

Assuming that the U.S. propaganda machine did its work well, you all know
what GATT means: no more dumping, no more import restrictions and free trade
for everyone. The whole world one big free market, a capitalist eldorado.

So where the heck is the free trade in cryptographic devices and software? 
U.S. exporters are at a disadvantage here because they cannot access
foreign markets as easily as foreign exporters can access the U.S. market.  
The U.S.A. are protecting foreign markets from their own exporters, how
foolish! 

As I understand, it is still utterly difficult for a software company to
obtain an export license to Europe for DES-based data encryption software.
You know that DES is a 15-year old standard whose key length has been
reduced to 56 bits to make brute force cracking not entirely impossible for
government organizations. Numerous software implementations of DES are
freely available from Europe. VLSI chips of DES have been developed at
several European universities. For such simplistic cryptographic things as 
used in PKZIP, export licenses are much easier to get, but they are still 
needed.

Of many programs, export versions exist that lack cryptographic capabilities. 
Software publishers have to maintain separate versions of the program for
export and they have to market a product with lesser capabilities than the
original product. This puts them in a competitive disadvantage. 

Finally, a U.S. program with severe export restrictions of which no non-U.S.
clone exists, will *not* be used in international data traffic from or to
the U.S., because you can't get a compatible cryptographic device or program
to the other end of the line. 

From recent editions of Computer Underground Digest I understand that the
U.S. government is actively trying to stop the spread of information that
describes the workings of cryptographic software. The programs themselves
and close descriptions of them are hard to distinguisgh anyway, they are
both just information. Needless to say that the advance of science 
is severely threatened by this new form of censorship. Note that the
prevention of disseminating unclassified information to whoever you want 
is a direct violation of your constitutional right of free speech.
The inofrmation may already public knowledge in both the U.S. and
in the rest of the world (DES programs) but you are still forbidden to
disseminate it. This is censorship in its purest form.

BTW When did the notion of exporting of information arise? Letters
(that contained no items of value) and telephone calls have always been free
of international trade barriers. If I receive a radio broadcast from across
the border, do I import something? Do I pay import tax?  

Now we know that export restrictions on software are bad, but are they any
good? Do they prevent Milosevic from encrypting his private communications
with the Bosnian Serves? The answer is no.
- First, many cryptographic programs are available from countries
  with no export restrictions on software. This includes DES and RSA.
- Second, software is easy to copy. It makes sense to restrict export
  of more missiles to a country that already has some. It does not make
  sense for DES programs.  


What can you do?
----------------

Write letters to newspapers, government agencies, politicians or the
American Ambassy in your country. in which you say why you find the current
ITAR regulations on cryptographic software bad.
- for their adverse effects on the U.S. economy.
- because they violate your freedom of expression rights.
- because they serve no useful goal. Khadafi and  Saddam Hussayn
  do already have access to plenty of cryptographic programs. 

If you live outside the U.S.A.
- Don't buy castrated versions of programs from which cryptographic
  functions have been removed for reasons of exportability.
  Get the full version or use an alternative program that is
  available in your country, Write the author or publisher of the
  software why you don't buy it.
- Get hold of as much cryptographic software as you can get 
  (particularly versions of DES and RSA) and show everyone what
  you can legally obtain from outside the USA,

If you live inside the U.S.A.
- If you are a software publisher, then complain that you cannot make
  all the profits you could without ITAR.
- Incorporate the one-liner from the last lines of this file
  into your international postings and e-mail. This program is a filter
  that can both encrypt and decrypt standard input to standard output,
  by XOR-ing the data with a pseudo-random series. This is a mild
  violation of the ITAR regulations (not really against the law).
- Get hold of as much cryptographic software from outside the USA
  as you can get. Show the authorities which programs Fidel Castro can
  get from countries without export restrictions on software.

In case you ever get busted by the FBI:
- compile the C program contained in the last lines of this file.
- uudecode saveme.cyp
- use the compiled crypto program to decipher this saveme.cyp
  crypto <saveme.cyp >saveme.txt  
Then you will see an argument that pleads you innocent.

IDEA is patented in the U.S. (#5,214,703) and Europe (Switzerland 01690/90).
I believe the European patent covers most European countries.  The patent is
held by Ascom-Tech AG.  Contact Dr. Dieter Profos at +41 65 242 885.

There are implementations on the net.  It's in PGP.  I have an article in the
next issue of Dr. Dobbs Journal that describes the algorithm and gives source
code.  There is also a listing in the Eurocrypt '91 proceedings.

There are other fast algorithms, but this seems to be the best.  Remember
that a class of weak keys have been discovered for IDEA (not many), whicih
can be corrected by a simple modification to the key schedule.  E-mail me if
you want details.

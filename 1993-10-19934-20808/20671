This is probably a dumb question, but would consecutive bits of a
randomly selected irrational number starting at a randomly chosen
bit position make a good one time pad?
 
If someone gave you some ciphertext and told you it was produced
by an exclusive or of the plaintext with the bits of a randomly
positioned chunk of a randomly chosen irrational number, what
sort of attack might be used to recover the data?  Assuming ASCII
plaintext, is there a type of differential cryptanalysis that
might be employed?
 
Thanks.

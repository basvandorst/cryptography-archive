I received an e-mail just now that the MS-DOS version of ViaCrypt's PGP was
now available for sale, together with ordering information. The message
asserts that it used PKP's patents with permission via licensing.

Regrettably, I use a Mac, and not a DOS machine, so I'll have to wait for 
the Mac version, assuming I can rely on ViaCrypt's implied assurances that
the product doesn't violate PKP's patents. I'm trying to confirm that with
PKP and will let people know what they say.

If PKP agrees that this is a licensed product, it comes as very good news 
indeed for DOS users who wish a "U.S. non-infringing" version of PGP, (and
when the Mac version comes out, good news to Mac users) who wish to
communicate with others who use PGP, and/or believe that IDEA is more secure
than the triple DES available in competing implementations.

(1) The tables aren't secret.  (Theoretically, it couldn't have been
exported from the US, but that seems not to have bothered many people.)

(2) The research was secret ("trade secret", for those familiar with legal
terms) until recently.  However, it seems DES is particulary resistent to
differential cryptanalysis, among similar systems, and that any DES-like
system can be broken with about 2^48 chosen plaintexts, making 56 not an
unreasonable key length.

(3) I'm sure we would have heard if modifications to DES were illegal in
the US.  (I can't speak to the UK on this.)

(1) The DES cracker chip is now feasible, although I don't know if any
actually
exist.

(2) There is currently no law against other encryption techniques in
the US, other than possible patent violations (RSA).  (It appears clear
that importing "an encryption device" into the US is legal.)

The law hasn't passed or gone into effect (yet).  However, the last is
correct.

I don't think any are in prison.  (Prisons usually don't have modems, so we
wouldn't hear from them.)  I think PKP/RSA squashed one the proposed
encryption devices for patent violations, and Phil Zimmerman and Grady Ward
are now under investigation for possible Munitions Act violations
(cryptographic equipment being consider munitions), but I don't think there
have been any arrests yet.

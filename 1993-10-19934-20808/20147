Even though your own post was obviously a smartass reply to the person
who suggested contacting the LA Times via e-mail? One might get the
idea that you reserved the right to behave in a particular manner and
then berate others who treat you in kind.

Your attempt at ridicule backfired and you got shot with your own gun
(you ended up looking far more stupid than your own victim). Take your
lumps with good cheer.

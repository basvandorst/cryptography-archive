I tried to post this almost a week ago and wondered why no one answered, but 
it looks like my newserver doesn't actually send messages any further than our
campus.  So, i'll post it here.

I was playing around with the distribution set of 2.3a and tried clearsigning 
a copy of config.sys. (MS-DOS 6.0)  PGP then reported an invalid signature.

It appears that the bug wasn't fixed.

Is anyone working on this?

"PGP," warns Dorothy Denning, a Georgetown University Professor
who has worked closely with the National Security Agency,
"could potentially become a widespread problem."

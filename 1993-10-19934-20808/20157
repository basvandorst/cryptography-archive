Now, I am authorized to release the following info. Bellow is the letter 
by Wolfgang Schneider of GMD in Germany, who, as a member of European 
PASSWORD team succesfully performed interoperability tests with a few 
American PEM products.

Please note that the notion of exclusive American strong crypto software 
is moot (Password people use RSA, DES, etc in accordance witg RFCs 
1421-24). I do not know how this info will be important for the 
Ward/Zimmermann affair.

The part marked > is mine.

Dear Borut,

Klaus Truoel forwarded me your following mail:

The three PASSWORD consortia developed three independent PEM implementations,
one from GMD, one from UCL and one from INRIA. All three have been
successfully interworked with the US PEM implemetations from TIS, DEC and
MIT. A fourth PEM inplementation from Stockholm did the same.

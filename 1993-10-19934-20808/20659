   I am an absolute novice when it comes to cryptography, so please bear
   with me. Does anybody know if there is an existing tried and
   tested key based algorithm that yields only low ASCII output (ie. 128
   and less)? If so, where can I get hold of it?

This is not intended to be facetious, even though it might sound like
it.

Get any "key based algorithm" you like.  Use it to encipher your text
and feed the result through (for example) uuencode to guarantee low
ASCII output.

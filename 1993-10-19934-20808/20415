Sure, use some sort of substitution.  Just have some sort of lookup
table which has, say, all numbers from 0 to 63 in some order.  Then
take 6-bit chunks of the data, use it as an index to the table, and
replace it with the entry found there. This is what is used in DES to
provide the non-linear component.  Note that the strength of the 
algorithm is in large part going to be dependant on the proper
design of the "S-boxes".  I believe the FAQ has some references on
good S-box design.  Hope this helps.

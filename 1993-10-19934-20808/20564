This essentially still gives you a limit on range since you can only 
measure the time the photon arrives (or doesn't arrive) to some finite
precision.  Usually the detectors that can measure single photons have
some noise and will detect photons even when none are there some of the
time.  If this is sufficiently rare it is not a big problem, but
if you only expect a successful photon transmission 10% or 1% of the
time (or even less) then the odds that any detected photon is really noise
go up proportionately.  The noise photons cannot be told apart from the

accept too many of them.  This means you can't send the photons more
than a particular distance which is a function of the noise in the
detectors and the transmission coefficient of your fiber.

You can't amplify the signal at all.  If you could amplify the single
photons then so could the eavesdropper.  You can however do quantum
key exchange between secure points a and b, and then between b and c
to send arbitrarily far I think.  I'll have to think about it some more.

Probably - however the problem would be to select a truly random irrational
number.  Just starting somewhere among the, say, 1000 first digits of a square
root of some integer in the range of, say, 1..65535, that would NOT be a
random selection!  A truly random soelction would probably best be implemented
by a random number generator.... :-)

Without analyzing this algorithm for effectiveness against
computer-aided cryptanalysis attacks, from personal experience I
think that there are some very serious practical problems with a
pencil and paper implementation. 

Some time back in pre-history, before the age of readily available
computers (ie, pre-IBM 1401 days), I learned how to design camera
and telescope lens using hand-calculated ray tracing. I learned the
direct way that the speed of pencil and paper calculation is _very_
slow and the error rates are moderate (>= 1 - 2%) when doing
extensive pencil and paper calculations. Every calculation had to
be double checked for addition _and_ transcription errors.

This was reinforced when I worked as a clerk in an insurance
company (pre-computerization) where I calculated policy values from
9 to 5 every day. There we had mechanical calculators to do the
arithmetic, but the error rate was still moderate (>= 0.5%, mostly
due to transcription errors) and the throughput still abysmally low
by today's standards. All work had to be double checked by another
clerk, and it was a _very_ rare day that anyone's error rate
dropped below 0.25%.

To more specifically address your pencil and paper algorithm, if
you consider a message of K characters broken up into N columns
with M iterations using different random keys, it is obvious that
the number of operations (adding two letters) is ~ K*N*M. 

For a 1000 character message (< 200 words) using 10 columns and 2
iterations, this becomes ~ 20,000 pencil and paper operations.
Taking the (wildly) optimistic assumption that this can be done at
a rate of 1 operation a second, encrypting the message will consume
~ 20,000 seconds, or > 6 hours. Decryption will consume a
comparable amount of time.

If the error rate of calculation and transcription is ~ 0.5%
(plausible based on experience with comparable pencil and paper
work), encryption of a 1000 character message will generate ~ 100
errors as will decryption. (Without the math text right at hand and
being too rusty to remember the formula) I would guess-timate that
~ 1/2 - 2/3 of the words would have one or more errors, which is
enough to make most textual messages very difficult to read and
would make transmission of numbers too unreliable to be of any
value.

The method might have adequate cryptographic merit, but it is
unfeasible both from enciphering time requirements and the expected
error rates in the encipherment.

   I have written a program that will perform a brute force search
   of the keyspace in 35 seconds on my 25MHz 486SX.

I've written one which takes a 512-byte sample from the ciphertext; xors
that with the rng's output and calculates the IC.  My prog. was written
quickly, rather than written to run quickly, but it still takes only 4
hours on a DEC 5000/25.  I could probably go several times faster if
I tried hard,

   It seem that neither text is 7bit ascii.

I agree with that.  Nothing spectacular in the IC output either.  Yet;
my run is only 15% complete at the moment.

Wonder what this stuff is.  A MessDOS FAT perhaps?  A GIF of the
magazine's logo?  The compiled binary of his program under 2 different
PC C compilers?

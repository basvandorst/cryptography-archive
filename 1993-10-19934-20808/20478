What we want are tests of _ciphers_, not of people.  And what does
it mean to have experience cracking ciphers?  I've never actually
tried to cryptanalyze an opponents enciphered message, but I have
done a lot of reading and thinking about the subject over the past
year or two.  So am I qualified to write a cipher system?

The idea would be that the inventors would do the testing; sci.crypt
would only be providing the tools.  Myself, I would not waste any
time analyzing your example.  But if the tools were there, people
would use them.  It would also be a learning experience for the
novice inventors.

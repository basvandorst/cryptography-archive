Do you know an FTP site that has a multi-precision _float_ package
available?  All the ones I've seen have just integers.

I read about the scheme you just outline in a scientigfic american 
article some years back; it also  mentioned that FFT based arithmetic
was very useful for this type of calculation.

Anybody have it available?  (This kind of stuff might also speed up RSA
caculations by the way).

For those who might be interested there is a single copy of the 
original hardcover edition of Kahn's _The Codebreakers_ (second 
printing, with dustjacket), available for sale from Powell's City of 
Books (not the technical bookstore) for US$40. I know they can do 
mail order to, at least, Canada and the U.S. It is in the espionage
subsection of the "military" section.

Telephone is: +1 (503) 228-4651

Make that ``pairs.'' Note that one can compute all possible x_0 given
(m,d); Knuth exhibits an algorithm for this.

So it's very easy to attack the cryptosystem ``xor with a fixed set of
bits extracted from a linear congruential sequence mod 2^b,'' given the
high bit of each byte of plaintext.

As for the challenge files SECRT1 and SECRT2: If the modulus was 2^24
and the sequence had full period, then the plaintext wasn't ASCII. Or
so my program tells me. Perhaps Stafford used a non-full-period
sequence, or a higher modulus.

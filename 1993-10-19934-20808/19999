Thus the original post that started all this, which contended it didn't
matter if one changed one's key, and said HE never did, was simply
incorrect, as I asserted in response.

By the way, if it takes a month to search out a DES key with conventional
hardware, and you change your key, you can get up to an extra month of
security, which can be very significant if the traffic has time value.

Still, the discussion has been useful in revealing some details of the
situation.

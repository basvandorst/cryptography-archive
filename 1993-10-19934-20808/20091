Please forgive the newbie question, but does that non-revelation mean
that the recipient should not be able - after decryption - to determine
who sent the message?  Or simply that in the encrypted form, there should
be nothing about it to distinguish it?  Or both?  Or neither?

Why would this be necessary?  If, for example, I were to send someone else
a graphic image (encryping it and binding it to the 'header' in a manner
similar to UUENCODE), it would have a name. When it was decrypted, it would
still have that name.  Why would a specific identified ("text" "graphic"
"binary", etc) be necessary?  Wouldn't such an identifier serve as an entry
point in an encrypted message - that is, serving as a 'known' plaintext
entry?

I concur that 'flagging' a PEM isn't overly prudent, but wouldn't it serve
just as well to leave a blank line as a separator?

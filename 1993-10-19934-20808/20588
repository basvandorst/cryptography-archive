Can someone post or send me the following information:

1. What are the best-known computer security conferences. I am familiar
with: 
Oakland Security Symposium - May
San Diego Security symposium - June
Usenix Security conference - October
Franconia Foundations workshop - June
ACM conference, Fairfax - November

Am I missing any?

2. What is the relative prestige and level of quality
   control at each conference?

Thanks a lot,
Avi Rubin

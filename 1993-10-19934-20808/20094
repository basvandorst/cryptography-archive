Sorry if this is a frequently asked question, but I couldn't find it
on the FAQ list.  I'm trying to find an encryption program (the 
purpose is so that anthropologists doing fieldwork can keep their
research notes private), and I'd like recommendations.

The algorithm doesn't have to be state-of-the-art (we're not trying to
keep things secure from the NSA, say), but I do have the following
requirements:
	(1) Must be free or cheap (starving grad students here);
	(2) Must be available for the Macintosh and for IBM clones
	    (it's OK if we're talking about two different programs,
	    one for each platform; it's just that we do need both);
	(3) It must be legal to take the computer out of the 
	    country.  (The whole point is to do fieldwork in other
	    countries.)

As I understand it, requirement (3) might be tricky.  Does anyone out
there know if there are any programs that satisfy these requirements?

Please respond by email; I'll summarize if I learn anything
interesting.  Thanks!

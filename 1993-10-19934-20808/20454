	One of the best pen and pencil cipher's I have seen is the
VIC cipher that is described in Kahn's book "Kahn on Codes."  It is
a cipher used by a Russian agent that was explained during the
agent's trial.  The claim at the time was that the FBI and NSA were
not able to decrypt it when they did not know the system.  Of course,
at the time they did not know how much effort should be spent on it.
	The book describes the details, but the basic idea is:

1. Convert the letter of the message to one and two digit values
   using a checkboard that assigns single digits to high frequency
   letters and digit pairs to low frequency letter.

2. Perform a modified double transposition cipher on the stream of digits.
   The "shape" of the first transposition matrix depends on the key.

	The most interesting thing about the VIC system is how it
generated the keys for the checkerboard and the transposition.  The
details are in the book.  Each message had a different key.
	This cipher has good error propagation characteristics (errors
only effect a few characters), unless the mistake is made during
key generation.

It does weaken it to some extent. However, if your "limited" alphabet
is still large enough (e.g., upper- and lowercase letter, digits and
control characters, instead of only lowercase letters) and if there
are enough of them in your key (e.g. 8 or more, instead of, say, 4),
then the "limited" pool of all possible keys is still large enough for
all practical reasons.

You should never deny the capability of your opponent to figure out
that you are stupid, see below. :-)

Correct. However, the attacker can just -suppose- that you are stupid
and have used a weak key and just try out a considerable pool of weak
keys (thinks like the words in a dictionary, "aaaaa", "zzzzz",
"abcde", "12345", "qwerty" and so on). This is exactly how people
crack weak Unix passwords.

There isn't, but as I explained above, nothing prevents the attacker
to just try out some weak keys and see whether they decrypt the
message.

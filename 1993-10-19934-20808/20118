   I don't think there is any confusion here (AFAIK = as far as I
know).  I know that the "original" BATF warrant was not, and again
AFAIK could NOT be "no knock."  The original "AFAIK" was to cover the
possibility that some other federal or state agency had, at some point
prior to the raid, gotten a no-knock warrant.  (Which would not make
the BATF raid legal.)

   I thought about this a long time ago.  Unfortunately, for the DOS world,
it's impractical, because the first run of a "disk organizer" (file
defragger) like Norton SpeedDisk would wipe out all traces of the original
location of the sectors.
   Also, unless backups are done in image mode, one never knows where sectors
will be restored to, giving the same problem.
   For other environments, your mileage may vary.
   There's also the problem of crypt overhead.  There aren't too many good
encryption algorithms that operate fast without hardware, and so far as I
can see that hardware would have to be designed into the disk controller
mechanism.

   One day I'll sit down and look at Lattice Software's SecretDisk and see
what exactly it does.  Maybe they had some better idea.

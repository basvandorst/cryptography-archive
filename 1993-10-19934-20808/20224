Steve Pope, in a discussion of why crypto export restrictions might
not be 100% offensive in a free country (:-)), suggested that one
reason is that if [people who don't support the current government] 
had access to commercially available crypto, maybe it would let them
decrypt secret government information.  He was of course flamed (:-)) ...

   Excellent point.  Yes, In the ideal world, all algorithms would 
   be publicly known, and only keys held private. 

   I think the counterargument is that, given the non-zero
   probability that physical security of keys may be breached
   (as in the Walker spy ring case), it is still desirable
   to hold the algorithms secret.

In an ideal world, you'd avoid making enemies....

Here's a technical approach that gives you the roughly equivalent security
using publicly known algorithms:

	|----------|    |----------|
	|  Algo 1  |    |  Algo 2  |
        |  Key 1   |--->|  Key 2   |---> 
	|----------|    |----------|
         Tamperproof
	 Burned-In       User-settable

Algorithm 1 with Key 1 are executed in a tamperproof container much
like the Mykotronx MYK-78 crypto-wiretap chip and followon Capstone.
Algorithm 1 is a symmetric-key system, and the key is burned in.
Algorithm 2 may be the same as Algorithm 1, as long as the two of them
together don't form a group susceptible to brute-force search.
Key 2 is user-settable.  You probably should execute Algo 2 and Key 2
in the same tamperproof container to make the intermediate value inaccessible, 
though it doesn't gain very much if both are known.

The reasons this is roughly equivalent are that:
1) Anyone who can steal the Key 1 can steal the Obscure algorithm about as easily.
2) If the tamperproofing doesn't work, anyone with a stolen box who can
reverse-engineer or otherwise crack this design and key can do the same
to your Obscure algorithm, which then loses any benefits of Obscurity.
3) It's capable of being different for different classes of users 
simply by using different Key 1s, but the strength remains constant
(unlike using different algorithms of different strengths, e.g.
Skipjack vs. DES vs. Obscure-6)
4) Anybody who was planning to use a weaker algorithm for speed reasons
clearly doesn't need the extra protection anyway, or else needs Re-Education.

The reasons it's better than using Obscure algorithms include:
p5) Users can evaluate the strength of the algorithms used.
6) Yes, a known algorithm is more susceptible to being cracked by
people without access to NSA secrets, but people concerned about this
can use two different algorithms, substantially reducing the risk that
mathematical or theoretical breakthroughs will totally trash their security;
anything that does that will give them a whole raft of other things to
worry about, like the security of their bank accounts (since bank EFT
networks use DES, as do many automatic teller machines.)
trashing our financial system is a much safer way to render the US
powerless than nuclear war....
7) If NSA never reveals the Official DES Trapdoor (tm), then anybody
who's worried about it ought to be worried about using an NSA Obscure Algorithm.
8) If NSA does reveal the Official DES Trapdoor (tm), we'll know
whether triple-DES was good enough, but it's certainly a good start.

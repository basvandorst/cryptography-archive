There was another set of "high priests" in this country; during
prohibition. There time was up, so they invented 'the killer weed', a
bunch of frightening propaganda, and the DEA. The also provided us with
a criminal sub-culture, a drug destroyed youth, a corrupting scenario
for the police, politicians and courts, and they continue to this day
expanding their influence and destruction into our nation.

Of course, the same results have devolved from ATF. Whitness
Waco.

I don't think that we can sit back and depend on the internet
and the concept of public domain to protect us from whatever version of
the DEA these "state security" groups will invent for themselves. Be
aware that their present chilling activities are fully supported by at
least the part of the federal justice department that is conducting the
grand jury investigation. Be aware also that grand jury investigations
have been used in this country as launching pads for massive propadanda
campaigns, both political and social.

Remember also Smedley Butler. The general they pick this time
may not be as dedicated to his oath as Butler was.

Shalom,

JBB.

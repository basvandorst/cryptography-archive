It seems to me it would be much easier to add a few bits to the keys
of a known secure system for any desired extra security than to
develop a multiplicity of separate new systems of posibly unknown
security and devlop a secure system for mixing them together.

Almost any system will leave SOME "signature" indicating the type of
encryption used. For instance DES produces 64 bit blocks so unless you
pad your messages with a random number of bits it will be an
indicator. (Yes, of course you will do this now that I have mentioned
it but do you KNOW all the signatures of all the systems you intend to
use?) This is a rather simple example but there are more complex and
more reliable ones. The "blockiness" of the cyphertext will often be a
key. You don't have to put "clear" identifiers on your message to make
it obvious what system you are using. Hiding the system type will
probably cause more trouble for your intended recipient than for a
cracker.

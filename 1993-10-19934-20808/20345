   AFAIK, nobody knows it for sure, but the answer is very probably 'no'.

Beware of dictionary attacks.  If the password is in a dictionary, or
a simple modification of a dictionary word, it will be found.

   So just do an MD5 hash of the password first. This will give you 128
   pretty regularly distributed bits, if MD5 is any good...


Good idea, but ensure that the password is really a pass phrase:
educate your users not to use a dictionary word.

   First, no known-plaintext attacks on IDEA are known. Second, It's
   still better to have 9 known bits, instead of the whole message with
   known letter frequency. Third, compression will save space.

If no known-plaintext attacks are known, how can you say that its better
to have 9 known bits rather than a known letter frequency?  The
space-saving argument is much stronger.

First of all, the paper mostly discusses generalized DES (G-DES),
i.e. DES with arbitrary permutations and substitutions. If the
specific E permutation in DES is used, performance can be enhanced
since one can take advantage of its special structure. The authors
maintain, however, that this is the only optimization which will
give DES better performance than G-DES.

A whole range of techniques for the optimization of G-DES is covered
in the paper. Some of these are previously known:

1. The entire cipher structure can be transformed so that the E and
P permutations become adjacent and so can be combined into one.
There are two ways of doing this, the 32-bit model and the 48-bit
model.

2. Permutations can be implemented with small look-up tables which
are combined with OR or EOR.

Some (presumably) unknown techniques are several variants of pre-
computing key specific tables. This saves the EORing of subkeys in
each round. I am quoting the section headings:

7.1 EORing subkeys to one of the smaller tables. (*)
7.2 EORing to the appropriate bits of all smaller tables. (*)
7.3 Reordering the S-box entries with respect to the subkeys.
7.4 Moving the subkeys to make use of Sections 7.1 and 7.2 directly.

(*) see 2 above.

Then there's a known technique for DES:

The E permutation can be implemented (on a 32-bit architecture)
by one copy, one 8-bit rotate and two ANDs if the S-boxes are
implemented as four tables with 2^{12} entries of 4 bytes.

This can then be combined with the precomputation of key specific
tables mentioned above.

As far as I can see, some of these techniques are mentioned in
your ALGORITHM file, but not all.

Btw, I later discovered that the figure of 136.5kbit/s I quoted for
a 386/16 in my first posting was for G-DES. Code for DES wasn't
tested on the 8086 architecture, but extrapolating from the
Macintosh figures the speed increase will be a factor of 1.58, so
the actual throughput for a 386/16 is probably around 215kbits/s.
Besides, the move from 16-bit to 32-bit operands should improve
things considerably.

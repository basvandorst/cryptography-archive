I am told that these pernicious devices, intended to screw loyal
customers when the company goes bk, implement some form of DES
encryption.  The more I think about this the less sense it makes to
me.  Where is the encryption/decryption going on?  If one has the
dongle to begin with, wouldn't one simply be able to record the data
being transmitted via lpt1.  If not is there an easy way to get past
this implementation?a

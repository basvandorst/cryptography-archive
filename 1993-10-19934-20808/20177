Business Week, Octover 4, 1993 carried a report by John Carey under the
subject headline.  The lead was "Philip Zimmerman wanted to strike a
blow for freedom."

Quotes include:

"I do not think they've got the export policy together enough to be
split" says a congressional staffer, commenting on the fact that the
administration is trying to further restrict software exports while
loosening controls on hardware.

"The underlying problem, explains Paul Freedenberg, a Washington
attorney and export control specialist, is that 'Clinton is very
cautious about dabbling in national security.  This is an area tha has
essentially been turned over to the spooks.'"

"The U.S. government it succeeding only in crippling an American
Industry's exporting capability." (attributed to  Douglas Miller of the
Software Publishers Assn.)

"Still the NSA can't stave off the inevitable for long.  (Rep. Sam)
Gejdenson (D-Conn.) hopes to produce legislation by early next year to
revamp government policy on high-tech exports.  The result will probably
include looser restrictions on encryption software--and a victory for
Phil Zimmerman in his battle to keep snoops out of his cyberspace."

(Gejdenson will not be the first congressman to under estimate NSA.)

Yes, but DES (or the particular encryption chosen) is not
(must not be) susceptible to a known plain text attack, so
this is not a problem.  I believe that the only known plain
text attack against DES is a brute force method which some
have shown is feasible, but fairly expensive.  Use of triple-DES
most likely raises this to infeasible for the near future.

In general, a user would have to both lose the device (most
of these devices are tamper resistant so that it is relatively
impractical to duplicate the device and return it to the
original user) and disclose his PIN in some manner in order
for the authentication to be compromised.

At least this is my understanding of these things.

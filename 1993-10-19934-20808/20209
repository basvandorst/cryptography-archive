There is one DES variant mentioned in Chapter 4 of the Biham-Shamir book
'Differential Cryptanalysis of the Digital Encryption Standard', 
Springer-Verlag,  1993, that raises the immunity level to differential
cryptanalysis of a 16 round implementation to that greater than brute
force.  This involves replacing the XOR in f(R,K) with ALUs.  There
are some side benefits as noted in D. Dennings report on SKIPJACK (which
may or may not be related).  These include immunity to complementation
and lack of weak keys.  Another way to increase resistance to differential
cryptanalysis is to increase the number of rounds or repetitions of the
cryptographic function, reducing the signal to noise ratio.  (There is
an implied increase in key size.)

It should be noted that in general chosen plaintext attacks are not
practical, requiring the attacker have access to the defenders encryption
scheme loaded with his key.  Ciphertext only attacks on DES are not well
explored (at least in open literature).

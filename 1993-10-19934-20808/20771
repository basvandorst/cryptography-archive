If anyone has trouble getting a copy of my book, I would be happy to mail it
to them for $45 plus postage.  (Postage can very from 4th Class Book Rate to
Federal Express, and depends on what country you are in.)

If you prefer, you can order it from your bookstore.  (I've been getting
enough questions about this to post this info for all.)  All you need is the
ISBN, but here's the rest of the information:

	APPLIED CRYPTOGRAPHY: PROTOCOLS, ALGORITHMS, AND SOURCE CODE IN C
	Bruce Schneier
	John Wiley & Sons, 1994
	ISBN: 0-471-59756-2
	$44.95

I am currently attempting to get permission to put the index on line.

Bruce

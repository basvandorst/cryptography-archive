To some of us non-experts such a cryptosystem might seem to offer some
possibility of security (except that "a register" should perhaps be
"many registers").  However you clearly imply (i) that only "novices"
develop such systems and (ii) that all such systems are insecure.
Perhaps "experts" don't develop such systems because they cannot prove
them secure, as experts are required to (and perhaps also usually cannot
prove them insecure).  In any case, I'd like to see proof of (ii).
Would you kindly cite specific references where such a complicated
system has been cracked, since I would like to see how it is done.
(The systems cracked by Martin Kochanski in his Cryptologia article
were comparatively simple.)  Please give page numbers in your references.

  I think you are misinterpreting what I am saying. Of COURSE one
  has to rely on the keys to begin with. But, how does cracking
  ever finally occur? There is a message at the end of the line.

  Given that most messages consist of A WHOLE MESSAGE, would it not add
  substantial security to totally bury the message in noise of an
  additional factor of 10 or 100 times the message? I am speaking
  practically. Does anyone else agree/disagree?

It really doesn't matter which suggestion is chosen.  Moderating sci.crypt,
or creating a moderated sci.crypt.research, will both have the same effect.
(I assume that postings that the moderator feels doesn't belong in a
moderated sci.crypt will be dumped into talk.crypto.politics--or whatever.)

My only request is that only one proposal goes forward to a vote.  I think
this is an important issue, and having two competiting solutions will help
no one.

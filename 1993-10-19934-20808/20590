(IEEE*) To be correct, the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy. Sponsored by
the IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Security and Privacy, in
cooperation with ICCP. Usually in April or May at the Claremont Hotel in
Oakland.  One of the best known conferences. Tends to focus on research
issues.

Next year's conference will be May 16-18. The general chair is Cristi Garvey,
garvey@zoo.sdd.trw.com.

> San Diego Security symposium - June

I'm not familiar with this one.

> Usenix Security conference - October

(ACM) The Usenix Security Symposium. Sponsored by Usenix and in cooperation
with the ACM SIG on Security, Audit, and Control (SIGSAC). Contact
ellie@usenix.org

> Franconia Foundations workshop - June (Franconia)

(IEEE*) The Computer Security Foundations Workshop. A limited size workshop
sponsored by IEEE TCSP. There was a review of it in the latest SIGSAC Review
(Volume 11, Number 4), available from ACM. The general chair for next year
(June 14-16) is Ravi Sandhu, sandhu@isse.gmu.edu.

> ACM conference, Fairfax - November (CCS)

(ACM*, IEEE) The ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security. A new
conference, sponsored by ACM SIGSAC and hosted by Bell Atlantic, focusing on
cyptography and security theory and practice. This is its first year. General
chairs are Ravi Ganesan and Ravi Sandhu. Registration info:
acmccs93@isse.gmu.edu.  November 3-5 in Fairfax VA.

> Am I missing any?

Yup:

* Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC)

(ACM, IEEE) Week of Dec 6, Orlando FL. Sponsored by Aerospace Computer
Security Associates and in cooperation with ACM SIGSAC and IEEE TCSP. A good
conference (I'm presenting a paper there) with a unique tutorial program (I'm
tutorial chair) :-). This is it's 9th year, and it focuses on applications. In
previous years, it has been held in San Antonio (91, 92); Tucson (89, 90);
Orlando (87, 88); and Washington DC (85, 86).

* Issues Workshop at ACSAC (ISSUES)

(ACM*) Sponsored by ACM SIGSAC. A one-day workshop focusing on a particular
technical issue. This year, it's CMWs. Contact: ashby@mitre.org

* New Security Paradigms Workshop (NSP)

(ACM*) A small workshop focusing on new ideas in computer security. Sponsored
by ACM SIGSAC. Contact: Hosmer@dockmaster.ncsc.mil. Next year will be its
third year.

* Conference on Computers, Freedom, and Privacy (CFP)

(ACM*) Looks at privacy issues related to computer security. Next year will be
its fourth year. Held in March.

* National Computer Security Conference. (NCSC)

The biggie of them all. Over 1500 attendies, with varying technical quality.
Sponsored by the National Security Agency (National Computer Security Center)
and the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

Well, I'm biased towards the ACM conferences, but... 

In terms of true conferences, the big ones from the point of view of the
trusted systems field are: NCSC, IEEE Symposium, and ACSAC. CCS is new; we'll
have to see how that fits in. The best known workshops are Franconia, New
Security Paradigms, and the Issues workshops. CFP and the Usenix Security
conference tend to serve a different audience.

All are excellent. There is another conference, sometimes called the Ides of
March conference, but more properly the Virus and Security Conference (CVS),
that has had trouble in past years. ACM SIGSAC dropped in-coop-with status for
that conference this year because of the problems.

For any conference with which ACM/SIGSAC is involved, you will find
information on the conference (if we have any) available from ACM.ORG in
[anonymous.sig_forums.sigsac]. ACM.ORG can also be accessed via Gopher; look
in the SIGSAC Forum area.

Past issues of SIGSAC Review (which contain papers from the Issues workshops)
are available from the ACM Order Department, 800-342-6626, as are proceedings
from the CFP conference, New Security Paradigms (once published), and the CCS
conference (once published). Proceedings from the NCSC are available from the
NCSC (send email to NCS_Conference@dockmaster.ncsc.mil). Proceedings from the
ACSAC conference and the IEEE Symposium are available from IEEE Press.

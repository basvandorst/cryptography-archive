I think the point is that Mycotronix is one of two companies that is
supposed to be producing the Clipper chip knows very little about 
security.  This company, if things go as "planned", is going to be
partially trusted with the keys to America's every electronic
communication?  The French will have a heyday.

Also, AFAIK, rifling through trash is legal.  There have been so
many incidents of people being burned by putting sensitive material
into the trash that it's hard to feel any sympathy for them.

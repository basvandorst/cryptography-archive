This sounds like the scheme we used one place I worked to determine
who payed for coffee during breaks: Each person would reach in his
pocket and grab from zero to three pennies, then bring his hand out,
still closed.  Each person guessed the total number of pennies.
Then everyone opened their hands, and whoever guessed the total
was off the hook.  This continued until only one guy was left, and
he bought.  (This process also made our coffee breaks take about
20 minutes longer than they would have otherwise.)  We didn't need
the MD5 hash: since none of us was good at palming coins, or anything
like that, a visual verfication that no one was changing the coins
in his hand sufficed.

Another example that many of the computer problems we solve existed
even before we had computers.

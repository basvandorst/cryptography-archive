Common courtesy suggests that political posts such as recent threads
about PGP and treason should be posted to talk.politics.crypto and
not sci.crypt.  Followups posted to sci.crpyt should have the followup-to
header edited to list talk.politics.crypto, and also the first line of the
post should say "followups to talk.politics.crypto."

Straw poll:  anyone who does not have access to talk.politics.crypto,
reply by e-mail to this message.

Mail bombing dept:  let each reader send e-mail to one inappropriate
poster a day.

Followups to poster.  I will post a summary.

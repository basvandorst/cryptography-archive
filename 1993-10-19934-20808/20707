The near term future of the 51st state will also be interesting to watch
considering the recent election results...

I've seen DES implementations floating around the net...  I'm not sure
how the export law fascists would respond to anonymous FTP... considering
the fraction of elected U.S. lawmakers who know the internet from their
recta the answer to this might not even be well-defined.

All over the place, for whatever it's worth.  If someone has the dough they
can screw somebody who relies on DES for security.  In fact, if there are
enough people relying on DES that they're willing to screw, they can probably
do a bit of amortization and obtain a quite low cost per screwing.  :-)

Oh well... back to waiting for the gutters to scab over.

I don't know if there is a specific term for such a cipher, but by analogy
with common mathematical usage, I would call such a cipher an involution.
(More specifically, if C is a cipher, C(k) is a transformation on message
space; I would call C an involutive cipher if C(k) is an involutive
transformation for every key k.)

Only if the person knows the pass phrase you used to lock (encrypt) your
secret key.  That is not on the system, but in your head (supposedly).
Someone needs to not only get your secring.pgp file, but find out what
the passphrase (should be a full sentence or string of words, including
spaces) you use is before the files can be decrypted (PGP prompts for
this passphrase every time it needs to use the secret key).

PGP takes care of that.  Encrypt something with your public key, then
try to decrypt it - you get prompted for the passphrase to use the
secret key to decrypt.

The risks come from the fact it can be possible for one to capture that
pass phrase if they have the access, and know how.  That, and the
plaintext version of the data exists in temp files or memory during the
encrypt/decrypt process.  But the attacker has to have access to your
machine.  And access your account while you have the sensitive data
in plaintext form, as when you are using it.  If it is YOUR machine,
though, and you can screen the users (or deny others access), that
reduces that problem.

Still, the MOST secure is, of course, to run PGP on your own isolated
machine, so no plaintext is EVER on the multiuser system.

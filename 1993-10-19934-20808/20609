:     Well, PGP for one has an ASCII armoring function, which does

: compiled version and the source can be FTPd from black.ox.ac.uk among other

: encryption programs which includes PGP for almost all environments.
: Otherwise, when dealing with ANY encryption program, have you thought of
: simply UUEncoding it?

It should be noted that uuencode produces characters that may only exist
in the US ascii character set.  ASCII armoring is based on just using
those 64 characters that pretty much _have_ to exist on all computers.
(At least those that support fortran ;-)  If you have to talk to an
ebcdic based machine (ibm mainframs) or something _really_ weird 
(did you know CDC used to have its own char encoding?) ASCII armoring
is the way to go.

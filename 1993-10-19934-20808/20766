[ Sorry for the repost but I'm hoping to glean additional pointers. ]
 
Could people send me pointers to technical documents on:
 
Statistical analysis of words by word and word type (or group) for
        English.
Pattern matching on compressed text.
Information Theory on Filtering.
 
Please respond direct!  alan.pope@Eng.Sun.COM  I could never keep up
with all of these newsgroups individually.  Thanks!

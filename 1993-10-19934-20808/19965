M-16 parts cannot be manufactured with the "copy" command on MS-DOS.

Tanks can't be aquired by calling a BBS and downloading.

You can't ship ammunitition by EMAIL.

You can't end up with a jet fighter by running a textbook through a scanner.

For the folks who actually think the government is doing something
reasonable, get this through your thick heads: people in other
countries are as smart as Americans. You can get encryption software
on the streets of Moscow thats as good as you can get in New York. You
can't stop a technology this easy to disseminate, period. The
terrorists already have everything they need. No number of barn door
slammings will change the fact that the horse left twenty years ago.
Hell's bells, anyone at a foreign embassy can simply go to a computer
store, buy one of these so-called "weapons", put it in a diplomatic
bag, and take it out of the country -- if they wanted to bother, which
is unlikely. The information is already in textbooks around the world.
I can buy plenty good DES chips from the Germans, the Russians, lots
of folks. The "evil foreign people" have everything they need already.
Its too late.  You are living in fantasy land if you think anything
can be stopped.

The pretense that foreigners don't have strong crypto and can be
stopped from getting it by export restrictions is based on a
hallucination, not on reality.

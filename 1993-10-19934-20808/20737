But there are plenty of ways to make sure that your hosts are fairly
closely synchronized ... one of the better ways is to run NTP - Network
Time Protocol (Unix version available via FTP from louie.udel.edu in
/pub/ntp, there are implementations for lots of other OS's too).  On
our network all our hosts are generally within 10 milli-seconds (larger
deltas do occur because Sun's drop clock ticks when printing kernel
error messages on the console).  And yes, NTP does provide an authentication
mechanism to reduce the risk of forcing a host to have the wrong time by
sending it bogus packets.

Having closely synchronized clocks is handy in other security contexts too
(e.g. it makes sense to compare audit logs from different systems) ... not
to mention how useful it is to actually have a computer that knows what the
right time is rather than some vague approximation.

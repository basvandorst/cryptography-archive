Put the blame where it belongs. Sternlight has crossposted 12 articles 
to sci.crypt and talk.politics.crypto over the past couple of weeks. As
you know he often makes such idiotic comments that a dozen or more 
people feel obliged to respond. _Each and every time_ he has failed to
set his Followup-To line properly. Is it any surprise that there is 
still some inappropriate traffic?

The _sci_ part of _sci_.crypt should already be enough to make clear 
that this group is for science, not politics.

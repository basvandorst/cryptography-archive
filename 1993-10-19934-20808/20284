Does anybody know if repeating patterns within the 128 bit IDEA key
introduce any weakness into the system ? The reason I ask is that I
am considering writing an implementation where the key is based on a
user supplied password. I would not expect many users to enter a 128
bit password so I was going to repeat the password bits throughout the
width of the key. Anyone attacking my system is very unlikely to know
the width of the password before they start.

While I'm on this subject, I was toying with the idea of running each
file to be encrypted through an LZW compressor before encryption. But
since the first code output by LZW is either the 9-bit clear code or
258 (9 bits) I dropped the idea since it seems to introduce a known
start to each file. Was I right to do this ?

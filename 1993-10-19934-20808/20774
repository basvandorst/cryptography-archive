 I am now entering wide beta tests on a commercial, secret-key
 email cipher for DOS which I call Penknife.

 U.S. citizens who would like to participate (and get a free use
 license), are invited to apply to me, giving:

    1. their desire to participate in the beta,
    2. their email address,
    3. the location of their email host,
    4. assertion of US citizenship, and
    5. assertion of willingness to not export the program.

 The program "readme" file is available to anyone who wants it,
 as is the Penknife design document.


 I have multiple reasons for implementing yet another secret key
 cipher:

    There are patent issues with public-key ciphers.

    It is my impression that few PGP users actually validate the
    public keys they use, leading to potential insecurity.  No
    matter how easy validation can be, it is just not required
    for a secret key.

    I question the idea that strong privacy has much meaning
    between people who do not know each other.  And if people do
    know each other, they can generally transfer keys when they
    meet, or through mutual friends, or in their mail, packages,
    or by express-mail.

 Companies who have people flying to various sites should have
 no problem distributing secret keys when necessary, as well as
 recording the keys used to protect company information (one
 important issue not commonly mentioned).

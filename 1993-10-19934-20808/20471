Yes, they're using one-time pads.  It's mentioned in the FAQ.

A one-time pad is a perfectly normal hand-ciphering method; it works
just fine, but you have to have one page of key material for every
page of text that you want to send, and you can't ever reuse a key
page without compromising both messages that were sent with that page.

This makes it kind of inconvenient, though the security is
theoretically perfect if you use guaranteed-unpredictable random
noise, such as that from a radioactive decay source.

I would assume so, if the moderator was located inside of the U.S.  For
that matter, I suppose the moderator would always be subject to the whim
of the gov't in the host country.  For this reason, I wholey support
the idea of having multiple moderators located in different countries.
Oh, and for the record, I do like the idea of sci.crypt.research as a
moderated group.

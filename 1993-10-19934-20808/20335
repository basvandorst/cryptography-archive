   As I understand it, yes, _in pictures or images_.  I'm sure if I'm wrong,
   somebody will let me know :-)

Like Humpty Dumpty, you can define words to mean whatever you want them
to mean.

By steganography, I understand: "the process of hiding information other
than by textual scrambling such as cipher and code".  Ambiguous, yes,
but more useful than your definition, IMO.  For instance:

	This odd sentence amends usably to an agent.

Ok, that wan't very secure, but:

1)  Tell me what it means.
2)  Create a better one off the top of your head and mail it to me.

Anyone can do better than the above if they are allowed to think about
it.

A couple weeks ago someone posted a note saying they were looking for
computer time to attempt to break some code. Unfortunately that note has
expired from our system so I don't have it anymore. I have access to a DEC
Alpha and would be interested in participating. If someone has the
original note or the poster sees this would you pass it on or give me a
shout. 

Thanks

Rus

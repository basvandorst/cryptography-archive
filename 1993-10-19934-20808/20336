In response to your question concerning specific mathmatical models;

My best guess for where to start would be Shannon's theories of
Information transfer.  The whole point of tactics such as those
addressed in your original question, and encryption in general,
is to increase the information content of your message.  This is
why longer keys are better ( more 'confounding' information ), and
why one-time pads are perfect. ( A messages worth of random information,
which completely obscures the original information ).  I would
think that with a good understanding of Shannon's work, it would
be possible to put together a pretty good estimate of how much
'safer' large amounts of random garbage would make the message.
Hope this helps.  I would post a reference, but I don't have one
off-hand.  Maybe someone who does could mail it to Mr. Silverman.
Or it may be in the FAQ.

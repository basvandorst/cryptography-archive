Can anyone recommend some good books on cryptography for a beginnerish
person?  I have been wanting to read up on it for quite a while and now
I finally have access to lots of books.  What's good?  I'm interested in
public-key, one-way hashs, and block ciphers.

thanks,

My opinions are not the school's, although they should be!

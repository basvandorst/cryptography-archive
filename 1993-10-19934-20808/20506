I am considering joining the Naval Reserves as a Crypto specialist.

Is there anyone out there who would like to share their experiences with me
or suggest courses of action?  I am interested most of all in job
satisfaction and a rough description of duties.  I would be joining as an
E5.

Please post to: MXC34@PSUVM.PSU.EDU

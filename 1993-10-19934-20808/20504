	I would like the following programs to made available if anyone is
interested in taking the following into an archive site.

	The following are some basic cryptographic programs I wrote for my own 
purposes or for Dr. Stephens cryptography class with Dorothy Dennings
"Cryptography and Data Security" and Sinkov as (necessary) references.
	The documentation is sketchy, and I may improve it in time, but
most of the programs are quite small and simple and perform algorithms
that are quite well known.

File Name			Purpose
------------------------------------------------------------------------
c6.c				A tool for solving transposition ciphers. 
				(Method of Sinkov)

crt.c				Solves for the inverse of a number (mod n) 
				using the Chinese Remainder Theorem.
                                                      
freq.c				Gives a frequency list of characters in
				a file.

ic.c				Give the Index of Coincidence for a
				given text file.

jac.c				Lists the probable prime numbers between
				two integer values.

knap.c				Exhaustively breaks small knapsack
				ciphers.

rprime.c			Finds the percentage of two random
				numbers happening to be relatively prime.

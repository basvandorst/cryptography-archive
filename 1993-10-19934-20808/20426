Certainly if it's an algorithm, but there are some very secure pencil and
paper codes probably still in use today by spies and the like who can't
carry computers around with them.  I remember reading somewhere about a
cipher used by Che Guevara, for instance.  In the rec.radio newsgroups
from time to time they talk about the "numbers" stations that transmit
by voice long sequences of numbers or letters and are presumed to be sending
instructions to spies.  I would guess these are using some manual
ciphering method.

So if you've got something you want to keep secure from someone with
~$1M, use triple des with transposition.  Or compress it or use a one
time pad before encryption.  Read the sci.crypt faq and get a clue.

Security is not binary; there is always the question, "What level of
security do I need, and what am I willing to pay to achieve it?"

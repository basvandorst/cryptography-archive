State lotteries ought to be very good for this, if the timing is acceptable.
Fat chance of influencing them, and if one _could_, one would have better
things to do than play dice games. ==:)

How about everyone picks a number and encrypts it in an unambiguous message
which is encoded using a private-key cipher and a randomly-selected key.
Then everyone exchanges messages.  After everyone has all the encrypted
messages, they exchange keys.  The sum of all the numbers, mod 6, is the
die roll.  Note that the encrypted messages must be long enough to ensure
that there is a unique intellegible decryption for each one

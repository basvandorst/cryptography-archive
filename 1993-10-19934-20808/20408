No, because you should have given PGP a passphrase which needs to be
entered before the key can be used.  If you choose a suitably long &
obscure passphrase you should be secure from this sort of attack.
However there is another attack on PGP run on a multi-user machine you
should be aware of (see below).

This can be acheived by using a passphrase, as described above.

To ensure security, PGP should only be used on stand-alone single-user
machines.  A passphrase can only stop attackers if they can't find out
what it is.  Under Unix (or any other multi-user platform) it is
possible for an attacker to snoop on your tty and capture your
passphrase.  Anyone who gets both your passphrase and secring.pgp can
decypher your messages, spoof messages as you, or send out a message
cancelling your key.

All of this is covered in the PGP docs.  You should probaly reread them.

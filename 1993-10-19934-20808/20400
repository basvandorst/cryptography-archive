Summary: question on pgp usage
Keywords: pgp,help

I have recently compiled pgp on my sun workstation. 

Thanks to all of those people who suggested pgp and have replied to my
previous posting and email.

After reading most of the pgp documentation and running some tests it
seems that pgp isn't as secure as I would like it to be on unix.
By this I mean that by setting a public/secret key pair anyone that
is logged in as me, someone being root then doing a su to my login, can
decrypt my files because of access to my secring.pgp file.

Is my assumption correct ?

How can I have a public/secret key that needs to be entered every time,
no matter who you are logged in as?

As the documentation states, pgp was originally made for PC's, and there
seem to be security risks on unix platforms.


Any help would be appreciated.

I don't think it has.  The information I've got on it claimed that "Australian
law demands that law enforcement agencies be able to intercept telecommunic-
ations networks [1]... it is a condition of the carriers licence.  Apparently
some compromise or arrangement has been worked out, the details of which are
not certain".
 
[1] As in: "We intercepted this phone exchange making a run for it", I suppose.
 
I presume the "compromise or arrangement" nicely sidesteps whatever security
A5/A5X actually offers.

The RSA system is a method for encrypting a message, such that anyone
can encrypt a message, but it takes a second key that only the owner
knows to decrypt it.  This is known as a Public Key Encryption.  The
trick is that the public key should not allow anyone else to figure
out what the private key is.

In order to do this neat feat, two large numbers (usually primes) are
multiplied together and in order to break the code, you need to factor
this large number.  When Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman invented the
code, they published the above number and asked people to try and
break the code through any means possible.  Since that time, (1979?),
the only method that people have thought of is to factor the number.
Or, if they have thought up a different attack, they aren't talking
about it in public.  (I am simplifying things a _great_ deal, almost
to the point of being wrong.  But, this still gives you the reason why
you might want to factor such a large number)

This encryption system is very easy to implement, and anyone can
easily create the public and private keys.  Technically, the only
major problem with it is that it requires a program that can do
multiplications and find remainders of the divisions of these very
large numbers.  It is not hard to do, but it is slower than other
encryption methods and it is harder to implement as a single chip.

The other "problem" with this method is that it is patented, so you
can't use it commercially without paying a royalty.  (The patent will
run out in the US in another couple of years, and I am not sure if the
patent was ever valid elsewhere in the world.)


When the above number was published, it was believed that it would
take hundreds, if not hundreds of thousands of years to factor the
number.  Since that time, people have found better methods to factor
numbers.  More importantly, people are now able to use the idle cpu
time of hundreds, if not thousands of computers to work on the problem
in parallel.  If you can convince a million people to let you use
their computers for free for 12hrs per day, you can factor these very
large numbers fairly quickly.  

By factoring this large number, it would show that in order for the
RSA system to be really secure, you need to pick larger numbers than
"just" 129 digits.  This isn't hard to do, but it slows down the
encryption/decryption a little bit more.  Factoring a number that is
twice as large (2 times the number, not 2 times as many digits) takes
4 times as long (approx).  This means that if you had a 130 digit
number, it would take 100 times as long to factor.  If it can be shown
that it is technically possible to factor a 129 digit number, people
will just pick 150 or 200 digit numbers instead.



So, this is mostly an academic exercise to prove how that it is now
possible to factor numbers in the 129 digit range.  There is also a
$100 prize, but I doubt that the money is the motivating factor for
anyone.

Unfortunately some programs (eg ftp) rely on the remote machines
getpasswd
routine. So even if your own was OK, you could freeze out people from
remote use because the remote machine wasn't long password aware.
(Now why the hell anyone would have written a getpasswd program that
only passws on the minimum number of characters I don't know.
Does anyone know how prevalent such damaged getpasswd programs are?

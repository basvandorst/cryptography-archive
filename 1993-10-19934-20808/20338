Stronger than DES simpler than triple DES

Triple DES just slows down the processes of encryption and decryption.
If indeed the objective is expansion of key space a simpler approach 
is to observe a mason lay the bricks.  Bricks , as we all know
are layered height and breadth wise in a staggered manner.

	------ ------
	   ------ ------
	     ^   ^

	------ = Bricks		^ = stress points

Bricks are alligned to provide backup at any stress point.  So if you
need security you could build a big brick or use many bricks to layer
the same as triple DES.  Only problem with triple DES is speed.  A 
simpler way is to use a simpler kind of brick before DES.

Try the following combination -

	cipher text
	  ^
	  |
	-------
	DES
	-------
	 ^   ^
	 |   key 3
	 |
	-------
	Reverse add
	-------
	 ^   ^
	 |   key 2
	 |
	-------
	Add
	-------
	 ^   ^
	 |   key 1
	 |
	-------
	Xor
	-------
	 ^   ^
	 |   key 0
	 |
	data

This approach gives good security for one reason - while it
is feasible to break each stage separately - to break all of
these put together is much much harder. Also it is faster in 
hardware, though reverse add in software is slow.

This strategy is same as the one in SID (signature
interface to DES) concept I am working on - an overview
of which was sent with the ESS comments.  The geneis of this
idea is in the RSK (Ram Shyam Key) approach that was presented
at the 'spread specturm potential commercial applications 
myth or reality?' conference in summer of 91.

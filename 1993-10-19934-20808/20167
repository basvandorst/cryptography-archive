I agree. Being a bear of Very Little Brain I can only glean rather than
contribute, but I've joined several groups connected with aspects of
cryptography and it's frustrating to be paying a LOT for my feed, and
see the same meandering threads pop up all over. I don't normally
complain because I'm a believer in "if you don't like it, go elsewhere",
but it would be pleasant to have an "elsewhere" to retire to
occasionally.

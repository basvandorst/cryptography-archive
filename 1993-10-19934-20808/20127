Great - then if nothing else, we've succeeded in making the (insert
favorite invective) _pay_ for it.  If we can run the time/cost up enough,
we may still succeed in discouraging them.

Everything I can do to slow down, discourage, delay, disorient, deceive,
aggravate, or otherwise befuddle "the enemy" is a plus - and if I can do
it with little or no effort.....  Granted, they may still 'get' me, but I
can do what I can to make them _earn_ it!

As I understand it, yes, _in pictures or images_.  I'm sure if I'm wrong,
somebody will let me know :-)

Or possibly have more than one public key - a _public_ public key (for first
contacts), and a 'private' public key (for follow-up communications)?

Letter frequency is pretty well known for most languages - shouldn't be
too hard to hack in a generator that creates plausible gibberish :-)


As near as I can tell, the 'philosophical' idea behind crypto is to deny
information to The Enemy; it simply seems prudent to do anything that
brings me closer to that ideal, and makes that information harder for The
Enemy to obtain.

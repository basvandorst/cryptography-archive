What would be really wonderful would be invisible signing of documents.
There are only a few messages I need to encrypt, but I would like to
sign virtually every one.

Is this a real problem? Since each user only has to generate a key
one time, typing a few hundred keystrokes does not seem to be such a 
terrible burden. It will be interesting to see if future demand for 
encryption causes manufacturers to include hardware random generators.

I may be a bit naive, but is it possible to keep software source 
libraries from being freely distributed overseas? Wouldn't it be more 
likely that once develped in the U.S., the library, or a thinly
disguised version of it, would appear on systems all over the world?

Congradulations on a wonderful document. I look foward to reading
the entire document, as well as, the followup messages that
will appear in this and other groups.

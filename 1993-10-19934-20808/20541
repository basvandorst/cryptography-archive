Actually it does not matter- You just need to use those that do get
through for the cryptography. The only thing you have to be sure of is
that the phase coherence between the two modes ( be they two
polarisations or two frequencies) do not get messed up in the
transmission. - ie if you lost 90% of your photons going down the cable,
you would have to keep careful track of the time at which your partner
received their photon, and make sure that you only use the pair of that
photon in trying to set the key. You would have to make sure that you
did not amplify things along the way as that introduces far too much
noise, but losses of themselves would not mess things up (just make it
necessary to use more photons- but photons are cheap).

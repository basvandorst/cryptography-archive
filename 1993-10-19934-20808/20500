   Does anyone know the status of PKCS #10?  I've seen many references to it in
   some pem documentation that I have but can't find it anywhere.  The references
   are to:

   PKCS #10  -  Certificate-Signing Request Syntax Standard.

   Also found references to version 1.5 of PKCS #7.  Anyone seen this version?

PKCS #10 and revised versions of the other PKCS documents just
completed a balloting process among the PKCS participants, and are
scheduled for release this month. The new versions will be available
via anonymous FTP to rsa.com in the directory pub/pkcs, and by email
to pkcs@rsa.com.

If you'd like to become a PKCS participant, we'd be happy to have the
input.

Because then you're essentially dealing with an unmapped image.  One
problem is that there's not much demand for grayscale images these
days...

First, if you're dithering down to a fractional-sized palette first,
any artifacts will show up not as typical "noise" but as banding
from posterization.  Fortunately, people have limited gray-level
discrimination abilities, so you can construct a properly-spaced
(not linear) 64-entry palette, or even 32, and quantize to that.
If you're thinking about PC display hardware, much of which can do
no better than 64-entry linear anyway (unless you cheat), things are
even simpler.  This gives you 2 or maybe 3 bpp in an 8-bit grayscale
image.

But really, who cares how the image looks?  If Spook Central is
scanning the airwaves, they're going to use automated scans
with heuristic and statistical techniques -- is the palette
weird?  does the noise spectrum suggest bit twiddling?

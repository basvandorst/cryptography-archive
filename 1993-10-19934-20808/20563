Not true.

Here is an example (excluding the XOR stage for present)

Input = 28, key2 = 81, key3 = 13
	28 + 81 (addition) = 09 (overflow drop)
	09 + 13 (reverse addition) = 12 (overflow drop)
Given I/O sets such as (28,12) it is not straight forward to figure
out the key values.  In next step try with the initial XOR.

Not true.  You can and probably will use the same set of keys on large
set of data.

Not true.  This does not require large volume of keys.
But the above assertion for careful choice of keys is still valid.

If you are interested could send you first iteration of analysis.

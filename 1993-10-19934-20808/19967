I believe the issue under discussion is export of ITAR items in "13b".  
Wether you like the "rules" or not,  they are there, and are
understandable.   Help is available if you don't.  A stick if you
disregard them.

There is a difference.  My understanding is that PGP is a completed
operational system (ala "PGP 2.2 Key available via finger").  I havn't
seen the "Moby Crypto" package but "heard" it had all the essential
features short of being compiled.  I expect one of the Govt's questions
might  follow " Mr. Ward, have you ever compiled the source code in
question".  I'd bet lunch the true answer is affirmative.

Possibly true for crude implementations.  There are more neuances than
most think.

That still doesn't make it "exportable by personal decleration or whim". 
"Anyone" didn't take the steps to put the essential system together. 
There is significantly more to a good secure system than linking DES and
RSA code.  

(ob_mode_on  Precisely one of the reasons the Net's "homebrew" Secure
Telephone won't fly anytime soon. No one has yet to ask questions in the
most difficult areas in Secure Telephony...They're hung up on V.42 vs
V.xx with / without compression, which is a relativly trivial issue. 
Best I can tell, no one commenting has any experience with existing
Secure Telephones.  ob_mode_off)

Mike
We shall hypothetically continue your analogy.  As you passed the
pulled-over vehicle with the officer attached, you "penta-digitally"
signal the 2 occupants and the officer.  The officer smiles and
"penta-digitally" responds.  The 2 occupants, Grady and Philip, frown and
do not.  They got caught.  I'll bet the "everyone else was doing it"
argument probably doesn't work in Canada either...

"Everyone" is not exporting complete Crypto/Comsec Systems without
license.  That's a falacy in the argument.  There are differences in what
is a viable system and what is 2 modules linked together.  

I expect policies may change with time.  The "Genie" doesn't go back in
the bottle.  That doesn't mean anyone can make their own rules today.

P.S. Say a co-authorship paper?
And I'm glad to see U.S. Constutional experts outside the US.

Fact:  Motorola makes more (and better) Secure Communications equipment
than ANYONE in the world.  They didn't make the preceding response.

	If the enemy is a government censor and the distribution
method is broadcast, how does the enemy know which of
potentially millions of [hiding methods] are being used?

	If a subtle identifier through an anonymous mailer through
an anonymous mailer ...  how does the enemy know who sent it?

	Sounds like pretty good tactics for 'civilians.'

	However, if the governmental agencies, ie. Tmen/Gmen/FBImen,
etc., have a real need for tracing suspected criminals, then
classic methods will uncover for them all the keys they need.

	The Watergate break-in would not have been 'illegal' if
a judge had issued a warrant, reality notwithstanding.

	Shalom,

PS. Provided the civilians are allowed those freedoms.

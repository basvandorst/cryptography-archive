I only have numbers for 80486sx/33Hz MSDOS Turbo C v 2.0 of
495kbits/s.  Divide by 2 for clock speed, divide by 1.5 for 386 -> 486
speedup and you still get 165kbits/s.
This is for a C DES library that was first posted to comp.sources.misc
18 months ago.  I don't have access to the paper (yet) but there are at
least 3 or 4 independently developed 'fast' publicly available version of
DES that have speeds in this range.
If anyone is interested in the speedups being done in the various
'net available' implementations, I have put in ftp.psy.uq.oz.au
pub/DES/ALGORITHM, a very, very brief (and not easy to read)
description of the speedups that I am aware off.  If the above
mentioned paper contains anything new, could some-one please
email what they are.

BTW for RISC processors (the times listed below are for C code with no CPU
    specific optimisation, there are public version of DES that are
    a bit faster but they normally contain #defines for specific architecture)
	DEC Alpha DEC 4000/610 AXP OSF/1 v 1.3 - gcc v 2.3.3
	DES ecb bytes per sec =   1223712.35 (  6.5uS) or 9.5 mega bits/s
	sun sparc 10/30 - gcc -O2
	DES ecb bytes per sec =    555949.47 ( 14.4uS) or 4.3 mega bits/s
	PA-RISC 1.1 HP 710 cc
	DES ecb bytes per sec =    505971.82 ( 19.7uS) or 3.9 mega bits/s

      good code is freely avaliable on the net)

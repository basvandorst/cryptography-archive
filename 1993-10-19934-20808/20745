Make that section 3.6, exercise 7 (second edition, of course). Let <X_n>
be a linear congruential sequence of full period modulo 2^32, with
multiplier c and increment a. Given bits 16 and 17 of X_n for 150
consecutive values of n, Knuth says, we can easily compute c and
(c-1)X_0 + a.

(His reference: ``See D. E. Knuth, `Deciphering a linear congruential
encryption,' to appear.'' Anyone know where that article appeared?)

Does a single bit of X_n, over a wider range of n, suffice?

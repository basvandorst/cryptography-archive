   I think the reason this discussion has gone so far has more to do with
our stupid legal system than anything else.
   Look at the way pork is written into Congressional bills having nothing
to do with the pork project; say, the International Frammis Act has a
provision in it requiring that all 13-year-old females carry a whistle.
Any such female without a whistle would be charged under the International
Frammis Act, not "failure to keep a whistle in [her] possession".
   In this town, to keep more than three cats, one has to possess a kennel
license.  Now, when I had 5 visiting cats along with the two who live here,
I was technically in violation, not of housing too many pets, but of running
a kennel without a license.  I don't breed them, I don't sell them, I don't
show them, and in short I don't do any of the activities of a kennel; but
it's the kennel laws that would have gotten me in trouble.
   It's a Stupid Lawyer Trick and belongs on Letterman.  ITAR just happened
to be a convenient place for the crypto-rulers to put their pork.

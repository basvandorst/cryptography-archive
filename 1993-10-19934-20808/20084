Key sizes can be deceiving.  I was hypothesizing (guessing) that there may be
some way to attack the two DES keys used in 3DES independently.  Then again,
I think that I may have been improperly extending a meet-in-the middle attack
for double DES to 3DES.  In any case, for a pure brute force attack on the
112 bit 3DES key, you are right.

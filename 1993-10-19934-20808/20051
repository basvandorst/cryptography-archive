}                     Sternlight's Cat
 
When one considers David Sternlight's current byline aphorism 
"When the mouse laughs at the cat, there is a hole nearby" in 
the larger context of his effusive government spokesmanship, the 
mind-set of a professional apologist for an entrenched rule-
bending/rule-breaking bureaucracy is clearly evident.
 
Consider the metaphorical implications of his veiled warning: we 
have the government cat -- fat, powerful and dangerous and not be 
trifled with by mere squeaking mice who dare not speak in its 
dangerous ambit unless there is a handy (possibly constitutional
ly granted) escape route immediately available.  Get the point, 
squeakers, shut up or at least show some respect for the Fat Cat. 
And don't say I didn't warn you, either.
  
Whose world is this anyway, David?  To borrow the words of MTV's 
Beavis and Butt-head, your metaphor "sucks".  In spite of mani
fest difficulties, metaphorical cats such as yours have been 
belled -- and even balled -- before.
 
As we glimpse the royal government barge and its steerage of 
crypto-weenies and academic hangers-on disappearing in several 
directions at once into the enveloping fog of a post-cold-war 
night, we cannot help but note that this lumbering craft is 
faintly illuminated by a single sternlight -- though one that is 
scarcely a "lux mentis".

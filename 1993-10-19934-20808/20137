Cryptography has interested me since my secret-society days in
grade school and a bit more seriously after reading The Code
Breakers by Kahn. I now browse through shareware programs
found on BBSs. Today I discovered this conference (4262).

Questions:

     1.   Could someone please let me have brief comments on
the above programs.

     2.   When will (Crypt)MPJ2 be released and how will I be
able to get it for review purposes?

     3.   How good are IDEA and Skipjack and where can I
find them?

     4.   According to my dim understanding, (1) the only
unbreakable cipher is one made with a one-time pad at least as
long as the plaintext and based on truly-random numbers and
(2) the only way to get those is by recording certain kinds of
noise from space. I have a PC and no radio-astronomy gear.
Professional cryptanalysts have supercomputers and parallel
processors. Am I right in believing that they can break all
shareware-enciphered files with relative ease?

Thanks for your help.

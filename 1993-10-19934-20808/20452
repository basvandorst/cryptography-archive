Summary: I need a benchmark for CF factoring code.

Keywords: CF,factoring,mainframe
Will someone factor a 31-digit number for me? I need a benchmark for
my CF factoring code. If you have an access to a CF factoring program
on a mainframe consider doing this favor for me: factor number N (below)
for a multiplier k=1 and the factor base of 17(3,5,7,11,13,17,19,29,31,
37,41,53,59,61,71,73,79.
N=189 577 950 450 782 666 797 047 959 208 1.
I would like to know how many quotients need to be examined and how many
are factored. I need these data for benchmark for my own implementation
of the CF factoring algorithm.Thank you, Ted.

Hi,
  I have a zip file that I encypted with a password, but I forgot
the password or I mistyped it.  It's been about 6 months ago.  Is there
a way to by-pass this or to crack the code?  I think I've heard of
some programs that may do this, but I'm not sure, and I didn't know where
else to turn.  Thanks for any help you can give me.

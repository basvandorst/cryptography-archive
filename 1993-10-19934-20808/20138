I think there *is* a need for a seperate s.c.research.  Take a look at the 
example of comp.compression and comp.compression.research - you still need 
somewhere to post the equivalent of "What's the latest version of Zip" and 
"How do I decompress a file with .Z at the end" and "I've found a program 
which claims 16:1 compression" which are inappropriate for the *.research 
group but which, if posted in a unified group, will scare researchers away 
(or at least make them annoyed very quickly).

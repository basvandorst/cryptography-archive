Why can't the host software track the average rate of drift for each user's
crypto calculator? This should allow a much tighter window of validity.

For example, my wristwatch has been averaging about 0.37 seconds fast per day
over the last six months. It's been predictable to within a second or two on
any given day. That's a pretty narrow window.

As another example, some ordinary HP calculators have a time function. They
also have a way for the user to tell them the drift of their timebase since
the previous adjustment. The calculators then adjust for the drift.

Well, there's the venerable

PI/4 = 1 - 1/3 +1/5 -1/7 +1/9 - ......

but that's rediculously wimpy.

Try this

PI/4 = 4*ATAN (1/5) - ATAN(1/239)

where ,

ATAN(x) = x - (x^3)/3 + (x^5)/5 - (x^7)/7 + .....

This converges nicely, and will easily give you 10,000
didgits of PI on any reasonable workstation, or maybe even a PC.

There are more complicated ways to calculate PI that converge
much more rapidly, but this is one of my favorite due to its 
simplicity.

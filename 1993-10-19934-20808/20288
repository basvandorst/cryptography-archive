In my view, moderation of sci.crypt is not the best solution (though
much better than the status quo). 

Research is clearly one topic in the much wider field of science. So
splitting sciencific newsgroups into some "public" branch and a
".research" branch where non-research postings are kept out seems
to be the best. 

Look into sci.math(.reseach) and comp.compression(.reseach), where
this scheme works very well!

There *is* growing concern in the public for cryptography. Thus there
is the need for a newsgroup in the net for a free diskussion of 
cryptography (even if all politics are cept out of it). The logical 
choice is sci.crypt.

Nevertheless I am tired of that much noise in sci.crypt. I think, the
worst worst possible outcome whold be a vote, with no (large enough) 
majority for either a moderated sci.crypt.research nor a moderation 
of sci.crypt.

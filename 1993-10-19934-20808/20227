   Of course there's a trend.  For years the government has been funding 
   Sandia to break the elliptic curve cryptosystems developed at the
   University of Waterloo.  That always seemed questionable to me.

They consider cryptography to have military applications,
so attempting to break something your enemies might use makes sense to me*.
So does trying hard to break it to help you decide if its strong
enough to trust with your own private data.

Sandia is a military research organization that does nukes and such,
and hires lots of bright folks.  How the NSA is letting them muscle in
on their turf is another question :-)  But they're probably good.



(*at least if you like having enemies and militaries, which is beyond
the scope of sci.crypt and talk.politics.crypto :-)

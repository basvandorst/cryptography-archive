A practical question:

My company is developing a server application that is started up
automatically when the computer (a UNIX system) boots.  This server
must open a connection to another server (over which we have no control)
and provide a password to the second server as part of the process of
establishing the connection.

The initial implementation of our server accepted the password as an
argument on the command line.  This compromises the security of the
password, as anyone with access to the system startup script can view
the plaintext password.  The problem we are trying to solve is:  What
can we do to keep the password secret, besides requiring the operator
to enter it at boot time?  The solution cannot require new or changed
hardware, and the password cannot be embedded in the executable.
Less-than-perfect solutions are welcome.

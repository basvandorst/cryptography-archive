Hmm... wouldn't that depend upon the effective key size?  If one could
produce an algorithm with an 128 bits-worth of encryption which could
still be done by hand, brute-force would be tough to crack.

More significantly, it would mean that a pencil and paper was sufficient
to "manufacture a munition" according to current law.  It would seem that
the free-speech implications of this would be inescapable.  Perhaps such
an argument could get the current laws invalidated?

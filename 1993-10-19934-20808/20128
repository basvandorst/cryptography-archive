	It's a good thing that the founding fathers didn't take such
	an attitude as yours back in 1776.  Somehow I can't see Thomas
	Jefferson or George Washington whining about how a British
	supoena might harm their business.  


>Repeat:  The system works.
	No, Mike.  Its apologists would like us to *believe* it will
	work. What you don't seem to realize is that from the point of
	view of public access to good cryptography the toothpaste 
	is already way out of the tube.  Whatever happens to Grady and
	Phil the die is cast.  Decent cryptography is in the hands of
	the masses.  Cold-war holdovers and quislings can tear their
	hair and gnash their teeth over it but the code is already
	out there.  Anyone with any knowledge of the internet can
	suck it off one of the machines Grady posted and put it 
	on any ol' machine they would like.  Those that don't have
	ftp access to those machines can and will get it from those
	of us who do.  It's out there.  My friends all have it.
	We can't all be arrested.  Perhaps if the government conducts
	a few show trials some people will be afraid to resist the
	incipient police state.  More likely people will be afraid of what
	will happen if they DON'T resist this governments attempt to
	step beyond its rightful role.

	Nah, the courts can't put toothpaste back in a tube.  It
	can't be done.  The order that the cold-warriors dedicated
	their lives to has been smashed and I'm damn glad of it.
	It was a rotten time in the history of humanity and I'm
	glad its over.  The high priests of "state security" still
	haven't caught on yet but their role in history is over
	and its time they stepped aside.  The social and governmental
	structures that supported the cold war are disintegrating.
	It's over Mike give it up.  The power of knowledge and 
	high speed computer assisted communications has gotten away
	from those who would be our masters, you can stop being
	their apologist now, there is no benefit in it.

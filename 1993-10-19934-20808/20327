   Does anyone know what the limit of characters you can give crypt,
   standard unix crypt, as a key ? Can you give it a file to use as your
   key ?

It depends on what you mean by Unix crypt.  Good old fashioned crypt(1)
is a toy.  It keeps stuff secure from incompetent browsers but nothing
more.  Crypt Breakers Workbench will break crypt()ed human-readable
files with ease.  If you want to play with it, get /src/security/cbw.tar.Z
by anon-ftp from black.ox.ac.uk  It contains a crypt(1) compatible
implementation.

The other meaning of Unix crypt I can divine, is crypt(3) which is a
function supplied with many Unices, but not all, which implements DES
encryption.   It is only a library routine -- you need to roll your own
code to turn it into something useful.

   Also, is there a better crypt, one that is nearly impossible to crack
   that is public domain software ? Possibly available on an ftp server ?

Yes.  PGP.  It's not technically public domain, but as good as.  It is
freely available and freely usable.  Get /src/security/pgp23A.tar.Z from
the same site, black.ox.ac.uk

   Is crypt harder to crack if the files are first tar compacted then
   compressed ?

Yes, but only marginally so.  Crypt is a toy.  Do not use it for
anything important.  Get PGP.

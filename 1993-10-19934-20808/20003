The pattern we've seen in sci.crypt -- a gradual dilution of technical content
with broader discussions -- has been repeated over and over on Usenet. I
suspect it's just a telesocial standard of behavior: as discussion groups
age, the base of topics broadens. To keep a narrow focus, individual subtopics
must keep pushing toward lower level groups. Thus we go from sci.crypt ->
sci.crypt.research, and later perhaps that will split into sci.crypt.research.hardware
and sci.crypt.research.software, etc. But sci.crypt -> talk.politics.crypto
doesn't go because the discussion isn't being pushed more deeply into the
sci.crypt hierarchy, which is where crypto types (both political and academic)
are going to look for crypto talk.

So I think a move to sci.crypt.research is a great idea, and probably the only
one that 'net culture lets succeed.

    Can you give any more information than this?  What EXACT command-line
options are you using and what is in your CONFIG.TXT?  I myself have a
version of PGP v2.3a online (running MS-DOS 6.2 with a 4DOS v4.02 overlay),
and I just tried clearsigning my CONFIG.SYS.  The result was a CONFIG.ASC
with an internal filename of CONFIG that had a perfectly valid signature on
it.  No problem.

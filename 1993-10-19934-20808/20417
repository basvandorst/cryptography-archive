   Yeah, right.  There's talk of splitting sci.crypt, or moderating it, and
   the people in the group don't have a place in the discussion.  Let's just
   leave it to the self-important professional news readers in news.groups,
   they know what's best for us.

Near as I understand the guidelines, a fledgling proposal belongs in
the group(s) it most closely affects or in email until it is fleshed
out as a formal RFD (Request For Discussion).  Then it is submitted
to news.announce.newgroups according to the guidelines, and discussion
is carried on in news.groups.  All RFDs are crossposted to relevant
groups, but Followup-To: news.groups.

   I tried to read news.groups a couple of times, but it's a huge group
   with a tiny S/N ratio for anyone not interested in Shaping The Future
   Of The Net.  Sorry, but I just don't have the time, but I do have an
   interest in what happens to sci.crypt.

Yeah, there's a pile of stuff there.  It helps if you have a decent
threading newsreader with kill capabilities.

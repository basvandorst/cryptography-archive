The answer is yes.

Fix a modulus 2^b. Say we are given a sequence of bits y_0, y_1, etc.
Is there a linear congruential sequence <x_n> modulo 2^b whose high bits
[x_n/2^(b-1)] equal y_n? What are the possibilities for the multiplier m
and first difference d of this sequence?

I have a program which, given y_n for a few more than 2^s consecutive 
values of n, will compute all possible triples (m,d). It runs in time
roughly proportional to 4^(b-s). For example, given 150 consecutive high
bits of a linear congruential sequence modulo 2^18, the program figures
out the right values for (m,d) in just a few minutes.

(Actually the program will find only (m,d) with m - 1 divisible by 4 and
d odd. Other cases are degenerate and could be handled by a different, 
simpler program.)

For all the people who wrote and asked me for a copy of the paper.

I contacted John Macdonald at Reading university and asked for copies of his 
papers 25 days ago. He said he would mail them to me in 10 days. I have tried 
calling him up to no avail. Finally I have managed to track down his Email 
address via Internet White pages:

        No Plan.
 
Never Logged in looks ominous :( At any rate I have mailed him reminding him of 
his promise to send me copies. I will try phoning again and if that fails try 
Snail mail. Thats as much as I can do. My apologese for the delay "due to 
circumstances beyond my control".

	best regards

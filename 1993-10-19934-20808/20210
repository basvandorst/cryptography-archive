Yeah, right.  There's talk of splitting sci.crypt, or moderating it, and
the people in the group don't have a place in the discussion.  Let's just
leave it to the self-important professional news readers in news.groups,
they know what's best for us.

I tried to read news.groups a couple of times, but it's a huge group
with a tiny S/N ratio for anyone not interested in Shaping The Future
Of The Net.  Sorry, but I just don't have the time, but I do have an
interest in what happens to sci.crypt.

Don't quote me the guidelines.  I've read them.  So what.

Just so there's some substance to this post, I'll add my opinion. :-)
Keep sci.crypt but discourage political discussions there.  Add
sci.crypt.research, moderated or not.  I lean towards giving it a trial
run as an unmoderated group, but switching to moderated later if
necessary.

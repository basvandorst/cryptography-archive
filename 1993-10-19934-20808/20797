Well, it depends. There are different kind of dongles. The simplest
ones require a simple message sent to them and send a reply back - I
mean, always one and the same reply. Others are a bit more
sophisticated - they encrypt the message they receive, using a secret
key stored in them, and send back the reply. The program that verifies
for the presence of the dongle does the same encryption and compares
the two results. If they don't match, it means that the dongle is not
present. I have even seen programs that have parts of them encrypted,
download the decryption *program* from the dongle and transfer control
to it.

You are correct that every such protection can be defeated, if one
tries hard enough.

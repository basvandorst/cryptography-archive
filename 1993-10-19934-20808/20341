Following this thread reminds me of a paper I ran across in CRYPTO or
EUROCRYPT called "proveably secure crypto systems" ('90 or '91 I think).
The idea is the same, you send a ton of garbage for every bit that's
got meaning.  They show that with 2^128 bits per message bit it's truely
impossable to find the message.  But it's just an academic excercise.
Even 2^16 bits per message bit is a touch much to wade thru, and adding
an external wrapper (like 3DES) does make the problem of decriphering more
difficult.  Sorry I don't have the article in front of me.

My point is that it takes *a lot* of garbage before you can begin to be
secure.

Patience, persistence, truth,
Dr. mike

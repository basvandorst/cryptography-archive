I think that's the point: _which one_?  If you're given a captured string
of apparently-random characters, how do you proceed?  Which algorithm to
try first?  Or has been noted elsewhere, what's to stop someone from
starting a message with "----- Begin PGP encryped message -----", and then
using DES-CBC? Or what if the encrypted data doesn't use a 'recognized'
algorithm (a rotten thing to do - _lie_ about what algorithm is being
used.....)?

It's worth keeping in mind that old saw about "assume".....

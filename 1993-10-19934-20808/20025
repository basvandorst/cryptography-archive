Are you sure about this?  I thought that the situation was that there is no
known easy way to break these, even with known plaintext and cipher, but that
is not the same as being sure that there is no way.  Yes, this is a theoretical
niggle, but we have seen so many hard problems solved in the past 20-30 years
that it is foolish to be too confident.  If I am wrong about this, and they
are provably secure in any reasonable sense, I would be very interested in
references.

I don't disagree with your individual retorts as individual retorts.  
Design information, which is covered, can be obtained from the media you
addressed. You're diverting from the primary issues.  Now let's get back
to ITAR and 13b.  

From "ITAR" 120.21(C) on the definition of "Technical Data" (which as we
*all* "know, or should have known" is licensable)

"Information which is directly related to the design, engineering,
development, production, processing, manufacture, use, operation,
overhaul... or reconstruction of defense articles.  This includes, for
example, information in the form of blueprints, drawings, photographs,
plans, instructions, computer *software* and documentation. ...."

What part of *software* didn't you understand?  I don't see any
exclusions for source, flow charts, object, psuedo code, etc, do you?

Should I attempt to point out you associative ad hominen attacks and
address your emotional arguments and multiple factual errors?
With a few hints, I think not.  I'll allow your ignorance. 

1. I'm willing to bet you have no idea of the international requirements
for 13b (how much "13b" is shipped out of Cocom/ITAR countries).  

2. The "Selective Enforcement" argument still doesn't change the rules.

3. The Germans do have one "excellent" DES chip which is ITAR controlled.
 The Russians do not have a "good" DES chip.  And yes, I do know.


If you don't like the rules, try constructive change. They are changing
through efforts of constructve dialogue, if you havn't noticed. 
 
If you'd like to join Phil Zimmerman, encourage your logic.  Phil might
like the company. 

It seems pretty clear you havn't read 13b,  don't know the rules and are
not involved in 13 b export, are you?

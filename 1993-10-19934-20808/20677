The above is an example of a misplaced posting.  

Legal issues (e.g. export controls) do not belong in sci.crypt.

Such postings just don't belong in sci.crypt.  However they are
entirely appropriate for other places (such as comp.org.eff.talk since
this is an EFF posting, and also talk.politics.crypto which has much
discussion of export legalities/moralities/etc).

Most everyone has been pleasant and cooperative in trying to sort
postings into appropriate newsgroups.  I'd be greatly obliged if the
EFF folks would try to at least direct followups into
talk.politics.crypto in the future.  Email to EFF in the past hasn't
resulted in this small change so I think there must be a mailer
problem between me and you all (hence this posting rather than private
email). :-)

To redirect followups, one puts the newsgroup name for followup
postings in the header that begins "Followup-To:" when you create the
posting using your news posting software.

Thanks very much.

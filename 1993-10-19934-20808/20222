Can anyone tell me what is the current status of the McEliece
public-key system?  I know that Korzhik and Turkin claim in
a EUROCRYPT '91 paper to have a polynomial time algorithm for
breaking the system, but this algorithm is not described in
the proceedings.  Also, according to the final report of the
EISS Workshop held at Oberwolfach in July 1991 (Springer-Verlag
Lecture Notes in Computer Science 578) "the validity of their
[Korzhik & Turkin] work is in question and remains to be verified".

Is there anything more recent on the McEliece system?  Has a better
description of the Korzhik-Turkin algorithm been published?  Is
the validity still in question?

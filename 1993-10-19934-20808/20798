Those interested in this topic will want to read David Chaum's
"Untraceable Electronic Mail, Return Addresses, and Digital Pseudonyms,"
Communications of the ACM, February, 1981, Volume 24, Number 2, page
84.  Chaum describes how remailers can solve the traffic analysis problem.
I believe the 1989 or 1990 Crypto or Eurocrypt procedures also have some
papers on the topic.

/pub/cypherpunks/remailers on soda.berkeley.edu has some scripts which
will allow Berkeley Unix users to run a remailer.

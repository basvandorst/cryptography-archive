Given the short duration of the key ( 1 minute ) you would have to 
carry out the "attack" within that minute.  The problem is that you have
no where to test your attack key except on the target host.  This 
has been anticipated and is unlikely to work.

However if you captured a key and could duplicate the algorithm on the
crypto card you would be able to regenerate valid keys.  I don't think
the crypto card approach can prevent this type of attack.  In this
case using a known algorithm (DES) is an advantage to the attacker.

I think it would be bad precedent to abandon a sci.* group and move the
"scientific" discussion elsewhere (though there are some similar cases:
sci.physics.research, sci.space.news).

I'd suggest first an RFD to moderate sci.crypt.  I think any new group
as you propose would have to be moderated, anyway.  So we just need to
find a monderator.

Gee, maybe somebody from one of those three-letter agencies would be 
willing to control the discussion of the group...

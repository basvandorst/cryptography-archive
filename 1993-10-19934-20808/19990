This is exactly the reason I felt the newsgroup split was ill-advised; I
assumed this would happen.  For the longest time I have been suggesting that
the technical people split off into sci.crypt.research.  Even if it is
unmoderated, its title makes it clear that it is only for scientific comments.
(One of the problems is that new people may not know of the other newsgroup.)
And then maybe we can get back some of the researcher who have fled the
newsgroup because of all of the chatter.

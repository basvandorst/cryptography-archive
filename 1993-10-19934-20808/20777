Me, I'm more of an engineer than a scientist - it just depends on what the
rewards are.  I don't think that anyone with a $1M investment is going to
waste their time on 99% of the traffic that's floating around.
My concern would be with algorithms that be broken within a reasonable
period of time on more widely available kit - such as 486s, SUN SPARCs
and the like.

Obviously those with the more attractive data need to be concerned, 

but I'm not.

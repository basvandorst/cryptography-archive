 Well, if you *did* trust "unrecognized algorithms," it *would* buy
 you all that much.  (I suspect the problem lies more in the
 "recognition" than the algorithms.)

 Assume that there are just 10 reasonable cryptosystems (I think
 there could easily be hundreds), and that multiple encryption were
 allowed:  This gives 1000 triple-encryption possibilities alone.

 And if you were a cryptosystem designer, you probably would trust
 your own algorithms.

 Eventually, a reasonable figure would be above 10^4; 13+ bits.

 One way to think of cipher selection *is* like adding bits to a key
 for a single cipher.  However, if someone, somewhere, has found an
 attack on that cipher, adding key bits may not mean much, whereas
 the ability to use a different cipher (even with many fewer bits)
 may give effective security.  Note that, in general, we will not
 know if someone does have such an attack.  One defense against this
 is to have *a lot* of good, strong, ciphers and to use them.

 *I* don't trust cryptosystems which have been around too long.

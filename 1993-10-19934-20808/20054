I like the .sig proverb because it can mean all things to all people. It is
also a neat projective test to reveal the reader's prejudices.

Another interpretation, which I would think a dedicated libertarian or
Constitutionalist could make, is that the People are the cat and the
Government is the mouse. Or one could interpret it that the Constitution is
the Cat and those who would abrogate our rights the mice.

Interesting.

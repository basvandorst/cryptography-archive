  This may seem like a silly question, but here goes.


  If you have a system that takes let's say N bit's worth of keys.
  That means there are 2^(N) possible keys. Now, I have seen people
  comment that if you pick your key's from a pool of fewer keys, buy
  doing something like useing an ascii string as a key, then you 
  weaken the system. 

  My question is, are you only weakining if the person trying to 
  break the system KNOWS you limited your key choise ?

  I would think that even if I used "aaaaaaaa" as a key it's 
  no weaker then any other, unless the person who is trying to 
  guess is KNOWS that I used only ascii characters, or that I used
  8 of the same letter. As a matter of fact, I would think that if
  I desided to never use ascii characters in my key, then if 
  the attacker knows this, then I have weakend the cypher.

  basicaly, I guess I am asking, is there anyway to tell that the key
  was limited to all ascii, (or some other limited pool) from the
  output of the encryption program (I understand that this is probably
  depended on the system, I hope that for any good system, you can't 
  tell anything about they key from the cipher text.)

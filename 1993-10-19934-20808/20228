   It's not just paranoid but a fantasy.
It's got one or two grains of truth behind it, but that just shows you
how clever they are :-)

   This is pure fantasy on each point. Evidence, please.

If there is a trapdoor, they'd probably deny it, but they'd certainly
be unlikely to advertise its presence like that.  There aren't any
laws about what kind of encryption you can or can't use in the US,
though if you are handling government classified information,
your security officers will tell you what's been approved and what hasn't.
Various government agencies have *tried* to get laws passed that ban
general crypto use, but haven't done so.  To the extent there are such laws
(e.g. use on amateur radio), they ban *all* crypto; they certainly
wouldn't force you to use DES, since that's still lots of work to break.

   Evidence of the last claim, please.

Not likely :-)  The grain of truth behind this is that there *are*
three design papers out in the academic literature for DES cracking.
All of them require building large arrays of stuff.
- Wiener's paper from BNR, which describes a very fast (3.5 hour) $1M
cracker using chips based on fairly standard technology, which they've
designed but not actually built either chips or boards.
- Peter Wayner's design (~$30-50M for 1-day crack) based on 
content-addressible memory chips which are now available;
I don't know if he did board designs to use it or not,
but if he's built a machine he's not telling us :-)
- Somebody from DEC who did a really fast Gallium Arsenide DES chip,
which would also let you do a 1-day crack for ~$30M-50M.

- Then there's the NSA's design, but buying the NSA is expensive :-)

Nah, though the NIST/NSA is pressuring the cellular phone standards
committees into accepting their bogus wiretap chips, and preventing
export of valuable technology.

There are laws and probably FCC rules about wiretapping, and the FBI
tried to get Congress to force phone companies never to use anything new
unless the FBI could tap it easily, but that hasn't happened yet.
And they certainly don't need to provide decryption now.

   >> As a result of the

   What country are you talking about? Not the U.S.  Evidence, please.
   What campaign? What organizations? What law?

No, there is lobbying to prevent laws like this from being passed,
which so far have been successful; see your friendly neighborhood EFF
or CPSR or ACLU.

   This is just nutty. Who? Where?

There *are* people who do crypto work outside the US, and crypto
projects that have done their development outside the US.
Some of this is for export law reasons; others of it is for patent law
reasons (since the RSA algorithm is patented in the US but not elsewhere.)
One of R,S,A (I think Adleman?), once reminded the NSA that as an
Israeli living in Israel, NSA ordering him not to publish was pretty dumb.

A few people have gone to jail for exporting crypto stuff,
but not many.

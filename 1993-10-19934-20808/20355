Looking at George Marsaglia's own 9 references: 7 self-citations,
one Knuth-citation, and one other guy shows up. 

My conclusion (pls note the disclaimers below):

  The recent developments in pseudo random number theory are ignored,
  the average engineer just doesnt know about the existence of
  "cryptographically secure" random number generators (RSA, Rabin,...)
  resp. "locally unconditionally secure" rng's (FTT/DES [ZMI89] ).
  
  Billions of scientific papers could contain more accurate results if 
  provably (*) unpredictable random number generators were used.

Why does the new generation of rng's not come across ?

Possible reasons:

- They are communicated only in hard-to-read and hard-to-get 
  journal/proceedings articles.
- They are too inefficient (but see [MS91] ).
- Nobody needs this perfect randomness (see for instance [KR88] ).
- Implementation may need special software (e.g. large integer arithmetic) 
- There are patents and arms export problems.

I'd like to hear opinions about this. Since my view is rather theoretic,
I may be as far off as George Marsaglia. 

I'd also like to get informed about the most recent developments (if any),
since I didnt follow the topic since January 1992.

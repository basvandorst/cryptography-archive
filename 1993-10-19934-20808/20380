Anyone looking for fast implementations of DES in software
should take a look at an article in the latest issue of
Computers & Security (Vol. 12, No. 5), titled "More efficient
software implementations of (generalized) DES".

For example, a PowerBook 180 (MC68030, 33MHz, 70ns RAM)
running their implementation of triple-DES in ECB- or CBC-
mode achieves a throughput of 384kbits/s.

The authors tested their code on the Mac architecture only,
but another person ported it to the 8086. The throughput
for an 80386/16 and single-DES in CBC-mode was 136.5kbits/s.
Not as fast as the Mac figures, but only 8086 instructions
were used, so there's probably a lot of room for 386/486-
specific optimization.

I didn't see any mention of a RISC implementation, though.

        Yes, thanks. I knew I wasn't totally crazy.

        In a sense, this is the equivalent on a *message level*, of what
        the NSA is attempting to avoid on a national level. The
        existence of so much encrypted messaging, most of it
        uncared-about garbage, that they won't know where to begin the
        search.

        Now, does anyone has a mathematical model for the increased
        security in a message as a function of the ratio of garbage to
        actual message? Also, is it only a function of the ratio, or are
        there are correlations between security and total message size?

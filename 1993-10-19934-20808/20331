Greetings:

I'm attempting an algorithm design, and I thought I'd probe the collective
mind for a clever solution to a problem that I am having.

I am looking for a one-way function that maps 8-bit values onto 32-bit
values.  By one-way, I means that there is no more efficient way to figure
out which (if any) 8-bit value a given 32-bit value came from than through
brute-force.  I also require strict avalanche; every bit of the 32-bit value
must depend on every bit of the 8-bit input.  And that the 256 possible
32-bit values not be correlated in any way.

The function should be key dependent, with the key length negotiable.  Key
lengths from 64 bits to 256 bits are acceptable.

I've been working on some ideas, but I hesitate to write them down lest I
needlessly limit everyone's thinking.  E-Mail me for details, and for info
on how I am using them.

Bruce

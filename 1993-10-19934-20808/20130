It is certainly not impractical - such a system exists: PC Secure from BT.
(It uses BT's proprietary encryption algorithm B-Crypt which exists in
chip form to minimise the encryption overhead).

Virtually all software (defraggers included) interface to the disk sub-system
via the BIOS INT13 interface.  The only one to watch out for in Windows 3.1
which (if you accept the default options) goes straight to the disk controller
by-passing INT13 entirely.

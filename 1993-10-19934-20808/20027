hello, everyone.
 
i intend to develop a program for ms-dos that will encrypt hard disks
on a sector level. for this, i need a fast and strong cipher, that
allows random access to the encrypted data stream. this means, i need
to be able to decrypt only a small portion of the stream, without reading
all the previous data. likewise, i need to be able to change small portion
of data, without having to re-encrypt nothing more but the data that is
being changed. any suggestions?
 
regards,
Mike Hensel

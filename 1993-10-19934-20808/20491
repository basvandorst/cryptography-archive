6 days ago, I posted an example of steganography *not* involving
pictures or images.  This was to clear up what was, IMO, a misconception
by another author.

I wrote:

   By steganography, I understand: "the process of hiding information other
   than by textual scrambling such as cipher and code".  Ambiguous, yes,
   but more useful than your definition, IMO.  For instance:

	   This odd sentence amends usably to an agent.

   Ok, that wan't very secure, but:

   1)  Tell me what it means.
   2)  Create a better one off the top of your head and mail it to me.


Precisely one person mailed me the hidden mesage.  Take a bow Bill
Cordwell,  cordwell@sandia.gov.

This particular method (made up on the spur of the moment, remember)
requires an even number of characters.  Rather than prepend "A", or use
a null as a word separator, or append a null, I dropped the "S" to
confuse the decryptor without destroying the sense of the message.

If Bill hid a message in his reply, it was far too subtly hidden for me
to discover it!

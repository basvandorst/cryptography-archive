Look at David's code again, simplify, and you will find that the key space
is only 2^24.  Urban is correct.

This is a great trick.  Well done.

To bad that Dave won't give us a plain text, or tell us what the format
of the files are, since from reading the article they are NOT encripted
with the same code as cypher.c

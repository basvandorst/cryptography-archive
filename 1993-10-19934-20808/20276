How does the recipient know what part is the message and what part is
the noise?  How does the recipient know how to find the message in the
noise?

Answer: you told them, as part of your crypto procedures.  So you have
to assume the enemy knows too.  

Or are you assuming that your people NEVER get captured and NEVER sell
their secrets?

If you want to discuss this further, it might help if you would
explain yourself more precisely; how exactly (like, show me a program
that does it) are you hiding the message in random noise?

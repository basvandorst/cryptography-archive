Depends on how you view it.  I believe science which has its best 
practitioners locked behind armed guards and whose fruits are banned
from commercial use will be a very different field from one where
commercial enterprises use the science as part of their everyday activity.

In the later, the science is likely to attract practitioners who have
substancially different personalities... personalities like Turing...
rather than those who are willing to work like mushrooms.   The work
is more likely to be openly discussed and the field may very well be
more active and productive.

These all impact the _science_.

'Nuff said.

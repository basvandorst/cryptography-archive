Under differential cryptanalysis the permutations make no
difference at all (except to slow down your software).

I heard this from a professor, who heard it from Horst Feistel,
that apparently the IP was only used to make the silicon version
of DES smaller. It seems that the permutation resulted in simpler
wiring of the pins to the chip.

Or course, this isn't gospel. It was at a conference, and we'd had
a bit to drink ...

Again, it makes little or no difference to differential cryptanalysis.
Even with a "raw" key schedule - i.e. a 768-bit key - DES is still
breakable in order 2^47.

All in all, it's a pretty good book. Especially 'coz my name gets
mentioned ;-)

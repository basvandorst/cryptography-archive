I remember seeing a program called PKSCrypt, in version 1.0 in around 
1984-5, does anyone know if this program ever came out again or what? 

I wish I remember the authors, but its long since left my hard drive. 


Does anyone know (or want to hypotheorize) what the first PC encryption 
program available was? and when?

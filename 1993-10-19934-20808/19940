If I had thought a little more before reaching for my compiler, I would
have seen that this can be easily proved.

Suppose there are N possible passwords and you change your password
after every k attempts to crack it.  Since the attacker is cycling
through the possible passwords, after you change it he's back to
square one.  His expected number of attempts E is therefore given by

  E = k/N . k/2 + (1 - k/N) . (k + E)        (k <= N)

The first term on the right is the probability of finding it before
you change times the expected number of attempts in this case.  The
second term is the probability of not finding it before you change times
the expected number in that case.

This gives

  E = k/N . k/2 + k + E - k/N . k - k/N . E

or 

  k/N . E = k/N . k/2 + k - k/N . k

so

  E = k/2 + N - k

    = N - k/2

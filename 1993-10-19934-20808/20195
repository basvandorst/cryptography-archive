hi.
 
a possible way to optimize des for speed would be to 'unrol' it, that is,
process n blocks at once (n is the word size of the cpu). to do this, des
s-boxes have to be converted to boolean functions, which then have to be
minimized. after discussing this with some people, i'm almost certain that
these functions won't be small enough to allow effective implementation on
32-bit machines. but has anyone ever done that (and if so, could they please
post the minimized functions here, or email me?)
 
regards

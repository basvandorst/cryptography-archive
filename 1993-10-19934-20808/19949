I haven't tried it yet, but...

I think if you used gray shade images, the encrypted data might be more easily
disguised.  In other words, convert the image to 128 shades of gray (0,
2, 4 ... 252, 254).  Then use the LSB for the encrypted data. The 
color map would then just appear to be a linear ramp. If you 
choose a subject matter for the image that is natural  (i.e. B/W snap shots
of famous movie stars from the 30's), I doubt if anyone would notice.

The small ammount of visual noise caused by the encrypted data should
not be obvious. When I do get around to trying this, I will experiment to
determine how many LSB's can be used before the image becomes too noisy.

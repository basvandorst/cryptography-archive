Before I distributed my fingerprint package (which includes MD5), I
checked with Bidzos. He said: ``I haven't ftp'd your software, but Ron
Rivest is the author of MD5, and RSA Data Security, Inc., the owner of
the copyright, has made it freely available via the license in the code.
(The same is true of MD4.) If your package says as much, I believe we're
happy that you've given appropriate credit.''

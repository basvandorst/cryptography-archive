With DES, there is no way to tell that the key used is from a limited keyspace.
However, if I were building a brute-force seach machine, I would seach keys
that correspond to words, near-words, and printed-ASCII first--just in case.
If the key selection is truly random, you haven't lost anything.  But if it
were not, you have a good shot at finding the key earlier.

The other answer is yes, some implmentations of DES obviously use a limited
keyspace.  For example, let's take the DES that comes with Norton Utilities.
That program uses the typed-in password as the key.  If you know that a file
was encrypted with the Norton Utilities DES--say you find it on the same
computer as the encrypted file--you know that the key must be printed ASCII.

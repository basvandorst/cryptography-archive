 I don't know that there is a "big deal."

 I do think it is reasonable to respond to a "Request For Comments"
 in a frank, direct way, and I find it disappointing that those who
 find other cryptographic problems in it choose to remain silent.
 PEM is intended to be a public standard; public comments on the
 quality of the standard should be welcomed.  It is only reasonable
 to conduct a broad public review of a unobvious technical design
 in a newsgroup which specifically covers that technology.

 The bottom-line questions are:  As currently defined, is PEM a good
 standard?  Is it a good *cryptographic* standard?  In this
 discussion we deal primarily with the background for the second
 question.

 I am certainly not worrying about my own capability to send secure
 Email.  But if the standard were more secure and more flexible,
 there would be scant motive to create yet another standard, and
 the public-key facility could be more worthwhile and more generally
 useful.  This may not be what everyone has in mind.

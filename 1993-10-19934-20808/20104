[description out of context of one aspect of article omitted]

In Today's LA Times is Part II. It's an excellent and detailed treatment,
starting on the front page and continuing for two more pages. There's a lot
on Mycotronix, a separate piece on, with a nice photo of Dorothy Denning
"Scientist Says She Can't Crack the Clipper Chip" which says "she literally
wrote the book on modern cryptography"

The main piece is balanced, and contains such material (about a man whose
business files were rifled and then posted to the internet) as "I was
struggling with the question of whether the government should be allowed to
intercept people's conversations"..." "he would feel differently if his
files had been rifled instead by a properly authorized government agent or
if his personal phone calls were intercepted by a court-ordered wiretap"

I don't cite the above to "prove" anything but simply to suggest that the
series was balanced, and not one-sided as poivre's post would seem to
suggest.

Recommended reading. Perhaps someone with more time than I have would call
the LA Times and ask permission to post the series here.

[Caution: crypto-newbie]

How useful is it to keep one's initialisation vector secret when encrypting
using PCBC mode (not CBC) under, say, DES?  I can see that under CBC,
keeping IV secret is only helpful if the message is 1 block long (in which
case I'd have thought that DES under CBC was overkill).  CFB mode I think
behaves similarly.  I'm not sure about OFB mode, though -- does it help to 
hide IV there?

Thanks in advance for any answers...

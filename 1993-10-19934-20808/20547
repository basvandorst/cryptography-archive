Thank you for the references.  I have in fact read the FAQ.  I am not,
however, aware that any of the books cited provide examples of, or
techniques for, cracking systems as complex as the one you made up
(in outline).  Please correct me if I am mistaken on this point.
 
I agree with what you say above about novices, but just as complexity
does not imply security, so also complexity does not imply insecurity,
contrary to what some readers of your original posting may have concluded.
 
I think it is in fact true that "the more complex [a cryptosystem] is,
the harder it will be to invert."  Were you to give an example of a
complex cryptosystem that can easily be cracked (and I'm sure you
could invent one) it would not disprove this statement.  To show that
it "isn't really true" you would have to show that complexity never
(or almost never) enhances security.

Forget about it. The human brain is the most sophisticated neural network
around. For the human brain to break DES (by itself, of course) would be  
equivalent to you staring for a long time at the ciphertext, and expecting to  
be able to see what the plaintext is from that. Even using pencil and paper  
there is no way you could do it. And no neural network is anything like as  
powerful as your brain.

Just my tuppence worth.

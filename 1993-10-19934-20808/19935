I've been waiting for somebody to set the record straight, but I've
given up.

There is indeed something called the "prohibited countries list" in
amateur radio. It is, however, *at the moment* empty for US
amateurs. In the past it has included countries such as Vietnam.

The list includes countries who have notified the US that they object
to their amateurs communicating with US amateurs. This is consistent
with Article 32, Section 1, Paragraph 1 of the International Radio
Regulations which state "Radiocommunications between amateur stations
of different countries shall be forbidden if the administration of one
of the countries concerned has notified that it objects to such
radiocommunications." These regulations take the form of a treaty to
which the US is a party.

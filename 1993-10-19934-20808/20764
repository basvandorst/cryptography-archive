Hi,

    I have a question about the export regs and restrictions. I've read 
the FAQ on the ITAR.
    I have been asked by a Canadian crypto programmer to post a request 
for peer review of an algorthim that he is publishing. I have seen other 
such requests in this group and they had editorial disclaimers for the 
ITAR. I am not acting as any kind of agent or representitive for this 
person. All correspondence will be to HIS address in Canada. Do I need to 
include any kind of notice or disclaimer to satisfy the ITAR or should I 
just post the message and not worry about it?

Thanks--

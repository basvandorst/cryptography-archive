Most companies write anything subject to most of ITAR in europe or the
third world and import it. Why fight rules you can walk around. I don't
care - I'm in europe and I hope the EEC doesn't get daft about cryptosystems
(It would be hard for it do so actually, how do you resolve free movement
with having the source to an ITAR covered encryption system tatooed on
your back....) 8-).
>2. The "Selective Enforcement" argument still doesn't change the rules.
The US are famed for selective enforcement it normally means use little
people in huge legal cases to teach lessons while the big boys pay the
politicians and everyone is happy. Sadly the US is no different to anyone
else here.

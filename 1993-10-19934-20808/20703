The last I heard the export regulations on DES allowed it to be moved back
and forth between the US and Canada without fanfare.

Wait a second... you're not saying that NT relies on DES for _anything_
are you?  Say it ain't so...

By the way, no regulation prohibits you from obtaining the DES algorithm
outside of the US or Canada.  You could probably find it in any university
library in Europe.  A number of European universities have implemented 
DES in silicon.  As far as I know the only things that people have been
screwed on are attempts to export implementations of DES.

And how about the Norton Utilities with its pseudo-DES with an even 
wimpier key length... whooo-eeee, better keep that safe.

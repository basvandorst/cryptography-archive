Unless you're a typist, good passphrases are hard to type in.  Whoever
you are, they can be hard to remember.  But most short, easy to remember
passphrases have an entropy of one bit per letter, leading to a very
small search space.

If instead you took a passage and used the initial letter of each word,
you'd get a great deal more entropy --- I don't know how much, but I'd
guess four bits.  That means you only need a thirty-two word passage to
do it, and you only have to type thirty-two letters.   So: make up your
own limerick.  Make sure it doesn't start with "There was a young
lady..." because that vastly reduces your search space.  Make sure it
isn't funny or you might be tempted to reveal it while drunk.

Problems?

Berry Herman proposed a running key cipher that consists of
XORing (or adding) the plaintext message characters to
a stream of key characters chosen from a specified locations
in a book.  William Freidman described how to break this
kind of cipher without any knowledge of the book around
1915 in one of the Riverbank Lab publications (available
from Agean Park Press in Los Angeles CA).

The basic idea is to guess at a probable word or phrase
in the plaintext and see if the resulting key character
make sense as english, once an initial break is found
you guess at the following and preceeding characters of
both the plaintext and key stream.  For example, you
assume that phrase "theywill" appears in the message,
and try it in every location.  Most locations will
produce junk for the keystream characters (the ones
chosen from the key book).  The right location will
produce a reasonable english fragment like "mentlike".

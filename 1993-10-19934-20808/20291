It seems to me that the usefulness of this technique would be to
prevent brute-force key searches.  If the opponent is looking for keys
which produce large numbers of ASCII, it would make sense to simply pad
the message with lots of non-ASCII characters.  The search machine will
hopefully reject the correct key when it sees all of the binary garabage.
The intended recipient will not be so easily deceived and can simply run
the message through a simple filter to take out the non-ASCII characters.
If we only put about one character per 8 bytes, alonge with seven bytes
of garbage, I would contend that a brute-force DES machine would have 
a difficult time determining the correct key.  They would need specific
knowledge of part of the message; not likely if it is composed largely
of random characters.  If they did have part of the message, they would
probably have all of it, making decryption a moot point.

On the other hand, once the opponent had isolated your key, say because
you sent a pure ASCII message with it, he would most likely try it on
your older messages.  At this point, trying to hide the message would
not be likely to succeed.  Of course, the fact that you are performing
such a hiding technique must be carefully guarded.  There is definitely
an amount of security through obscurity.  I know that it is not something
to be relied upon, but  a good dose of obscurity can certainly make your
opponents life more difficult.

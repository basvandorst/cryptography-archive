It's not just paranoid but a fantasy.

This is false. The maths and tables were never secret. Software versions of
DES have been published for some time. What was held closely was the reasons
for the tables (S-boxes). It was recently revealed, that some cryptosystems
are vulnerable to a particular attack (now published) called "Differential
Cryptanalysis". The S-boxes were designed to make DES stronger--resistant to
that. Since the method of attack was secret at the time, the government
wouldn't say why they recommended a particular S-box design, but the tables
were never secret and the notion that the tables contain a trapdoor is
simply false, as far as we know. Evidence, please.

  A small modification to the tables closes this trapdoor, as

This is pure fantasy on each point. Evidence, please.

This is false. Keeping the encryption scheme secret can delay an adversary,
particularly if it uses new principles. The cost is that civilians can't
check it for weaknesses, but if the inventors have done their homework they
have done so to the best of their ability. It's a trade-off, not a
conspiracy.

Nonsense. They are violating no laws we know of unless (at least in the US)
they export without permission or, if a manufacturer of crypto, they fail to
register as such.

Nobody knows if there are any "uncrackable" methods, except perhaps for
one-time pads with secure key distribution. The phone companies aren't using
that--it's impractical.

  They've bought the equipment, and are using it,

What country are you talking about? Not the U.S.  Evidence, please.
What campaign? What organizations? What law?

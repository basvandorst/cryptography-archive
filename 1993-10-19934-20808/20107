Mike
I understand it's supoena bait.

If you believe it's PD with a passion, nothing keeps You or anyone else
from starting a parallel defensive (or offensive) crusade. 

We're entitled to differing opinions.  Many "13b'er" would like your PD
argument / opinion to be shared by the powers that be, but that isn't
current reality.  If I err, I remaining in business, while continuing to 
work the issues.  If your opinion errs, it will be expensive at the very
least, more likely confining.  The opinions which matter after supoena or
warrant service come at an expensive price, even to "winners".  Repeat: 
The system works.

     *Many* (not just 2)  sides are forming.

     *It* may be Public Domain. 
 
     *It* may be 13b ITAR covered.  

     *It* may be both.  

     *And it may be covered by the 1st Amendment.

The ***courts*** will ultimately decide.

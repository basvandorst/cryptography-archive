	Hmmm... Well, I was thinking that the amplification of the photons would not be important since the phasing of the photons at the end point is that which provides the key.  But I guess that if one could amplify the signal without disrupting the channel one could also split the beam and do with it as they like.
	The reason I asked the question in the first place is because one of the articles I read seemed to assume one could use multi-node wires.  I'll followup with the actual references and text soon.  (I should have done that in the first place. <grin>)

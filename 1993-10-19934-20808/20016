Personally I recommend the single book

    _Codes_and_Cryptography_  by Dominic Welsh  (Oxford Press).

Note that the Codes in the title are algebraic coding
theory and Goppa codes, not dictionaries that map entire
words and phrases into numbers.





In the past the following books have been mentioned on

Knuth also has a paper in [sound of much paper being shuffled] the IEEE
Transactions on Information Theory on breaking LCRNG's.  It's in vol.31, no.1
(Jan.1985), p.49.  If anyone ever implements this (it's one of those rainy
month projects :-) I'd be interested in grabbing a copy to add to my
collection.

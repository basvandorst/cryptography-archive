In spite of the uproar over Phil and Grady, its apparently busi
ness as usual at ViaCrypt as evidenced by  their software product
announcement under "New Products" on page 39 of the Oct. ll,
1993 issue of Computerworld:

> message encryption program designed to protect electronic-mail 
> and data files.  Transmitted messages or exchanged files are 
> secured against unauthorized readers, and the program provides

A company rep contacted by phone indicated that their offering 
was licensed by RSA/PKP and that an export licence -- if needed 
-- was "easy" to obtain provided the licensee was "at least a 
"51%" American company".

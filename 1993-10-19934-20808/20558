I completely agree with the statement I underlined. And I think, it is not
possible to define 'complexity' in general enough way, but such that the proof
could be given.

Moreover, if you define the 'inversion'
of a cryptosystem as getting the original password from known plaintext and
corresponding ciphertext ( or more such pairs), than  it is trivial to create
a system which cannot be inverted - just omit 1st character of your password
and use the rest in any cryptosystem! So precise definition of the term
'inversion' is necessary.

If you define 'inversion' as calculation of plaintext from ciphertext without
knowledge of a password by a method quicker than an exhaustive search
(or even quick enough to be makeable on today's hard/software), I think
the complexity increases security (in worst case just by spending longer time
to calculate complex expressions), but if well designed, even more.

And if somebody claims that it is too difficult to prove that a given system is
insecure, but he thinks it is easy to crack it, it is just contradiction.

I have written a program to encrypt files which I have modified several times
to make it 'more complex', but not in a disorganized way - I always ask
'how could I crack my program? And what to do to make this impossible?'
It uses truly random numbers to make each time different ciphertext, 
combines PRNG by several methods, one taken from Knuth's book, changes size
of the block used by encryption, each bit in the plaintext influences
whole ciphertext, not all internal PRNG information derived from password is
used in ciphertext construction, etc.

I have posted here several times my program, but nobody replied to me
saying " it is easy to crack your program, just do this, this, and this".
Therefore I conclude it is quite secure.

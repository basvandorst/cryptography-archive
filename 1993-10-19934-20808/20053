I was wondering if someone who has gotten a copy of the new
Differential Cryptanalysis of the Data Encryption Standard book
could get in touch with me.  I've got an attack of my own I've
been working on, and I'm curious if it's mentioned in the book.  
The attack seems pretty straightforward, so it seems that someone
must have tried it.  On the other hand, I've never seen any mention
of it in the published literature.  I have checked all of the original
articles outlining the differential attacked.  While I will
probably obtain a copy of the book at some point, I just want to
make sure I'm not wasting a lot of CPU time on something which has
already been shown to work.  Thanks in advance.

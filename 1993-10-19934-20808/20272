Has anyone given any thought to the difficulty of cracking RSA as a
_conventional_ cryptosystem?  I would imagine that it would have to
be extremely immune to chosen plaintext attacks, in order to function
as a public key system.  I was just thinking that this is a desirable
feature of any cryptosystem, and that perhaps a "mini-RSA" with
shorter keys would be efficient and effective as long as the key were
kept private, like DES keys.

   What does mpqs mean?

The Multiple Polynomial Quadradic Sieve.

   What excactly is the formuls behind this?

mpqs has a work factor of exp(sqrt(ln (n) ln (ln (n)))) where "n" is the
value in question. I got by numbers by taking the actual work used to
factor rsa120 (at least the estimate of how much work was required, 830
MIP-YEARS) and used that to "calibrate" my computations.

   I presume by 4,600 MIP-YEARS you mean a 1 MIPS machine needs 4,600 years ??

Or 1 year with 460 10-MIP machines (or 46 100-MIP machines !!).

   What is gnfs? By what size is it faster than mpqs? How much faster?

The General Number Field Sieve. This one goes as:

   exp((ln (n))^2/3 (ln (ln (n)))^1/3)

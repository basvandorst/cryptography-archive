David,

   You should correspond with Dubois; I think that would change your view
that all one needs when targeted by a Grand Jury probe is "some general
advice...that most decent attorneys will give...free."  Dubois told me that
they've incurred considerable expense already, and even while the GJ deliberates,
they'd be foolish to simply sit around and wait. So they're assembling materials
for the DA to persuade him that the case is ill advised.

  >>Despite the enthusiasm of some, this is no Zenger case. In fact, it's not
yet even a case.<<

   Odd. It has a case number. I believe the DA certainly considers it a
case, as do Zimmerman and Grady. The idea that this isn't a case, and that
Zimmerman et al can just "show up with the requested files", then sit back
and wait, is naive at best.

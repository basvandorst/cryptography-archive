I would like to learn something about one-way encryption techniques.
What are they?  How do they work?  Is the goverment considering
regulating them?  If so, why?  Is there any good nontechnical reading
about this?  (Books, articles).  Is it possible to see what one of
these looks like?  Thanks.  -Steve(smarks@acs.bu.edu)

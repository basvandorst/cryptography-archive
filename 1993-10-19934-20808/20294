All the brute-force DES machines that have been discussed here (or
even contemplated seriously by people who could build one) assume a
known-plaintext attack.

If you want to talk about trying to prevent known-plaintext attacks,
then say so.  Nothing you've talked about specifically deals with making
brute-force search more difficult, because real-world brute-force
searches assume a known plaintext.

And make your own life more confusing and error-prone.

I'm not saying your idea won't work; certainly you will make it harder
to guess cribs.  The point is, people don't guess cribs any more.
Modern systems such as DES already must resist multiple-round adaptive
chosen-plaintext attacks, so cribs wouldn't help anyway.

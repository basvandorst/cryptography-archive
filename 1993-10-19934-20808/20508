RSA is way too slow to be used on each block of a message for any kind
of high-volume system.

If this doesn't bother you because you just want to send toy secret
messages to your pals, go right ahead.  But don't expect this to be
incorporated into a PEM standard; no sysadmin wants mail-reading to
suddenly jump into the CPU-intensive stratosphere with the likes of
ray tracers and finite element simulations.

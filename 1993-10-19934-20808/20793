These are interesting speculations, *masquerading* as facts.  Perhaps
this was just a Halloween joke?  If so, it may well be lost on those
outside of North America...

1. I have never heard of *any* reputable analysis leading to a
conclusion that DES has a backdoor.  I've heard plenty of speculation
in the last decade and a half, but no corroborative analysis.  DES
might be of questionable cryptographic strength at this point, but
triple-DES seems to remain as a reasonable solution.

2. RSA came about as the result of research that took place prior to
DES being adopted as a standard.  DES has been seen as
cryptographically inferior to RSA, but the latter was (and still is) so
much slower that it must be relegated to selected, critical
applications (digital signatures, private key distribution, etc.).

3. I have never heard anyone refer to Rivest, Shamir, or Adleman as
treasonous.  And what do you mean by "its author" (singular)?  Or have
you confused the RSA algorithm with Phil Zimmerman's PGP?  If so,
you're still pretty far from the facts.  Phil has not been charged with
*anything*, much less the potentially capital crime of treason!  At
most, the Grand Jury *might* eventually charge him with conspiracy to
commit an export violation.

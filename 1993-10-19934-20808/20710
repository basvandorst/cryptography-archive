Request for technical support:

	Iam developing a datadase of telecommunications applications and
related security issues involving the use of encrypting techniques. I am
currently looking for any information pertaining to the use of algorithms such
as RSA and DES in digital cellular phone systems. Interest extends to their use
within the SIM in GSM. Comments related to user security feature acceptance,
network needs and system flexibility will be catalogued. Potential database
users post a message.

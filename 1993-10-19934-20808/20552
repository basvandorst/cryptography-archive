Hello,

in papers and books about public-key-cryptography you can find much research
about cryptosystems based on the difficulty of number-theoretic problems
like factoring (RSA, Rabin, ...) ore discrete logarithm (Diffie-Hellman, 
MAssey-Omura, ...). I 've heard about one public-key cryptosystem with a
very different approach, the McElice System:

  McElice: "A public-key cryptosystem based on algebraic coding theory",
           JPL DSN Progress Report 42-44, pp. 114-116, Jan.-Feb. 1978.

(I don't have the original article.) 

So I 'd like to know:

  - How does this scheme work?

  - And has it been cracked?

In my textbooks I can hardly find anything about it.

Thanx


Stefan

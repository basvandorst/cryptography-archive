In fact, you really don't want to do this; you would be vulnerable to
some well known RSA protocol failures.

For example, assume that your attacker knows that there are only a
small number of possible messages; "yes", "no", and "maybe".  All an
attacker has to do is encrypt all three strings and then compare with
the encrypted message.

The great advantage of using RSA to encrypt a random key is that
there is no known plaintext encrypted by RSA, neither is there a
common string encrypted to more than one recipient.  This is a case
where the combination of two ciphers is stronger than either on its
own.

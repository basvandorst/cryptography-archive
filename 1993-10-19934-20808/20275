Here is what happens:

1) You boot your computer. The crypto driver gets loaded and
optionally mounts the encrypted logical drive after asking you for a
password and checking it.

2) You run the defragger.

3) The the defragger wants to read a sector. The crypto driver
intercepts the request, decrypts the sector and passes the decrypted
sector to the defragger.

4) The defragger want to write the sector somewhere else on the disk.
The crypto driver intercepts the request, encrypts the sector and
writes it back to the disk.

Where's the problem?

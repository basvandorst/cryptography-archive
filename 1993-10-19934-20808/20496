Nope -- the shifts are in a different direction -- start with PC-1(K).
The first and second subkeys are PC-1(K) ROR 1 and PC-1(K) ROR 3 for
encryption and PC-1(K) ROR 0 and PC-1(K) ROR 27 (ROR is the rotate of
each half of PC-1(K), as usual).  So this doesn't give you that property.

Nice try, no cigar.  I don't know why that's a good order for the key
schedule, BTW, it's just what everyone else uses.

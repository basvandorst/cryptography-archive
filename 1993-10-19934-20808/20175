Perhaps while we feeding the proliferation of news groups, we should
have one more: sci.crypt.flames.  This could be shared by sci.crypt,
sci.crypt.research, and alt.politcs.crypto.  If would be used for
threads that start out on topic, but degenerate into flame wars
about who spoke to whom in a condescending manner.  (An example of
this is the "Re: Sternlight's cat" thread, which has been bickering
about whether or not Warlock should have made fun of DS's name without
posting his own for so long that it is difficult to remember what the
original topic of discussion was.)

Now, alt.david.sternlight.fan won't do the job, because it's not just
DS and his anti-fans who are causing the problem.  We need a new
newsgroup.  If sci.crypt is moderated, or if we make a new
sci.crypt.research that is moderated, then when a valid topic
degenerates into name calling, the moderator can just start posting
the thread to sci.crypt.flames, allowing those who like such flame
wars to follow them, while letting everyone else have some peace
and quiet.

;-) ?   I'm not sure.

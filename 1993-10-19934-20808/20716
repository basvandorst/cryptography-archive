:You'll probably never get your code to run as fast as Urban's code,
:Paul: a PC's long integer is a 32-bit quantity (while PC compilers
:still sometimes use 16-bit ints, David Stafford's original code
:explicitly uses a long for the seed and multiplier in the linear
:congruential pseudo-random number generator), so the key space is 2^32
:in size.  Being very optimistic and assuming that a 25MHz i486SX
:completes a entire rng round per clock cycle, this gives:

:% bc
:2^32
:4294967296
:./25000000
:171
:%

:An optimistic 171 seconds ~= 3 minutes != 35 seconds.  Something is
:not kosher here. (!)

:Either Urban is using a short cut, or his exhaustive key search
:program isn't really exhaustively searching the entire keyspace.  Or
:maybe he has a new 4-way issue version of the 486. :)

I am using two short cuts:
* The key space of the posted program is really only 2^24
* When testing for 7-bit ascii I calculated the first bit manually
 (If you can guess the first character, you can calculate 8 bits
  and reduce the key space to 2^16)

I guess there are more effiecient known plaintext attacks that are
needed if the constants vary. (I won't do that this week)

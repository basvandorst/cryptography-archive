I'd recommend that the originator of a message be able to
specify a time delay before retransmission.  A fixed 0-15 minute
delay would not be adequate if the anon server was idle during
that time window except for a single message.

If a message isn't devalued by being delayed, it would be
much more secure to wait a random interval of a few *days*
on a busy anon server.  Because only the sender knows the
time value of the message, control over delay should be in
the sender's domain.

Another suggestion would be to provide a utility that sends
a junk message occasionally that gets tossed by the anon
server.  Even if a user's not actively using an anon service,
sending occasional noise would defeat traffic analysis that
would show foo@bar.com sending a real message through the
anon server.

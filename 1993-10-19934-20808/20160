	It seems to me that, rather than contributing to excessive proli-
   feration of news groups, it would be better to preserve sci.crypt for
   its original purpose.  Given that the noise level is so high because
   certain thoughtless persons insist on posting non-science articles to
   science news groups, and given that Peter is proposing creation of a
   moderated group anyway, the logical solution is to change the status
   of sci.crypt from unmoderated to moderated in order to enforce the
   chartered purpose of sci.crypt.


This suggestion has my full support.  When the question came up a few
months back, Bob Silverman offered to be a US moderator for sci.crypt.
I reluctantly offered to be a European one.  I can't speak for Bob but
my offer still stands: I'll take on the job but would gladly stand aside
for a better candidate.

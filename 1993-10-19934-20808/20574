    Well, PGP for one has an ASCII armoring function, which does
effectively the same thing.  The latest version (2.3a) of the MS-DOS
compiled version and the source can be FTPd from black.ox.ac.uk among other
places, ghost.dsi.unimi.it I know for a fact carries a wide selection
encryption programs which includes PGP for almost all environments.
Otherwise, when dealing with ANY encryption program, have you thought of
simply UUEncoding it?

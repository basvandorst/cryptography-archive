Sure I did.  You didn't understand it: >>Embodiment, approach and
attitude.

The primary point:
Embodiment: The elements brought together contain items covered in 13b.

Secondary Points:
Approach:  Establish a dialog for outstanding issues or impass, or the
"piss on the boot" tactic.   

Attitude:  "They" may be "government servants", but "they" like everyone
else deserve human treatment and respect.  If you're close to the "line",
you're more likely to get a warning or "data point" than a supeona if
there is an ongoing relationship.  I am aware of several such examples.

Here are different words, as quoted from the Federal Register Vol. 58,
No. 139  22CFR 120  (The "ITAR "13b" ):

Category XIII-Auxilary Military Equipment
(b) Information Security Systems and equipment, cryptographic devices,
[***}software[***], and components specifically designed or modified
therefor, incuding:
(1) Cryptographic (including key management) systems, equipment,
assemblies, modules, integrated circuits, components or software with the
capability of maintaining secrecy or confidentiality of information or
information systems, except cryptographic equipment and software as
follows:
[low end SW decrypt, Banking, analog text delted]

Shall we debate "***Software***"?  Object?  Source? Psuedo Code? Flow
Charts? Flow Diagrams?  State Tables?  I didn't see any exclusions.  

I believe the Public Domain argument is for items not covered by 13b (or
other) sections.  Example:  "Publishing" a complete description (FIPS 46,
et al) of DES does not make DES embodiments *not covered* by 13b.    One
cannot "publish into the Public Domain" an item covered by 13b, and
thereby releave licensing obligations. 


My use of "exempt PD tech data" is for "brochures, specification sheets
and some publications".  I believe you will find concurence if you check
with State.
Note "Source Code is considered Technical Data".  You cannot "Publish" to
subvert ITAR.  

If you're involved in 13b export, you already understand this.  I have to
believe you're not.

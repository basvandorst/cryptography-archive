   Assume it's part of the original information sent across the
   sea. Some totally silly thing like the 2nd letter, then the 3rd,
   then the 4th, etc. Look, I'm not saying that THIS thing would pass
   significant muster.


   All I'm saying (really) is that surrounding it with a lot of garbage,
   separatable only by a method (a 5 time method? whatever...) known at
   the other side, it will make the final product of the sophgisticated
   techniques described here, such as a PGP method, a bit more secure.
   For even if they somehow got at the final "plaintext" message, ti
   would still have the overwhelming cover of a lot of garbage. And they
   don't KNOW that it's mostly garbage.


   In an analogy, it's like saying that even if they finally get past
   the nuclear powered shields, and the titanium alloy metal walls, they
   still only have gotten into the apartment, and they don't know if
   it's the letters, the arrangement of furniture, or any of a million
   other possible correlations that contain the message.

   As opposed to when they finally get in, there is nothing but a letter
   in the house that says "I'm the message".


          Do you see what I am saying from a Gestalt perspective? The
          message is buried in apparent noise.

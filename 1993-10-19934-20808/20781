The time-based calculators that I've seen have closed the "replayability"
vulnerability by accepting only a single occurance of a given code.  In
other words, once you use any given number successfully, then you have to
wait until a new number is generated before you can (for example) log in
again.  And, if the time window is small enough then the "waiting period"
may not be too much an inconvenience.

Importance is irrelevant to sci.crypt, though it does have direct
bearing on postings proposed for news.announce.important.  
The only question HERE is how to SORT postings.

The net has collectively decided that talk.politics.crypto is the
Right Place for items relating to the politics, ethics, morality,
and/or legality of cryptology.  This is the consensus of the net, not
any single person.  Moreover, the entire SCI.* heirarchy is for
scientific, not political, postings.

At a minimum, followups should be and should have been directed into
talk.politics.crypto.  If you are not able to get a t.p.c feed, then
please let me know and I will be glad to help you get one (OSU was
formerly a backbone site, so I imagine it is there already :-)

Not likely to impact the _science_ one whit.  Likely to impact other
things, yes, but not the _science_ of the matter.

The following sounds sarcastic, but isn't intended to be . . .

Agreed.  All we need is a standard header type for attaching signatures
and modification to all existing news and mail software to create/honor
it.  To do this properly, we need a new RFC at a minimum.

The first of the public key encryption patents expires in about four
years (David, would you care to correct me?).  I figure it'll take that
long to get everybody to agree, so we should be right on track.  :-(

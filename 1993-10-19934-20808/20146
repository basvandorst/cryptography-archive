I remember a few years ago there was some interest, at least
in technical fields, with the theory of stream cyphers, ie
cypher systems that took their input one symbol at a time, and
spat out a corresponding output symbol.

Is there any work being done in this area now? Or is
everyone doing block cyphers (I seem to remember the two as being
fundamentally opposed, somehow..)

my interest? its attached to automata theory, or sequential machines,
in some way, and could be interesting to me in that way..

cheers, and thx in advance

If the given RNG (with the provided incrementer and multiplier) is used there
are more PK's and MZ's then you can shake _two_ sticks at.  That's from a
purely brute-force search of the keyspace.  Given the fact that I only
looked at the first 2 bytes of each decryption attempt for a few various
tags I can't claim an exhaustive search, but I can say that there's about
32000 MZ's and roughly the same number of PK's - about what you'd expect
with a random distribution.

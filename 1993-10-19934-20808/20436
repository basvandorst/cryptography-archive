   If anyone could provide published sources of info along the
   lines of storing the products of known primes for the use of
   factoring other numbers, I'd be very grateful...

It's about as quick to re-calculate the primes as required as it is to
store them, and it takes up a *lot* less disk space.  Assuming you want
a reasonable number of primes, that is.

   What I'm looking at is the fact that if you store
   2 x 3 x 5 x 7 ...
   and find the GCD of this number and a test number, it's rather
   simple to check for primeness and the range of effectiveness 
   will extend to the largest prime in the series squared...

Although this statement is undoubtedly true, and the method has been
used for hand-calculation before now, it is a great deal simpler and
uses less storage just to use trial division for small primes, and
something like Pollard's rho method for slightly larger factors.
"Small" depends on the speed of your computer, but a figure of 10,000 or
so is in the right ballpark.

If you want to factor or test for primality *big* integers, more than 20
digits, say, you will need to do rather more reading of the literature.
I won't go into detail here.

A good, accessible, but slightly dated reference is Knuth, The Art of
Computer Programming, Vol.2, 2nd Edition.   A must for anyone interested
in computer arithmetic, IMO.

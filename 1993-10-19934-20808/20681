:Forget about it. The human brain is the most sophisticated neural network
:around. For the human brain to break DES (by itself, of course) would be  
:equivalent to you staring for a long time at the ciphertext, and expecting to  
:be able to see what the plaintext is from that. Even using pencil and paper  
:there is no way you could do it. And no neural network is anything like as  
:powerful as your brain.

Could not a neural network be used to recognize likely plaintexts in
combination with a brute force machine?
A neural network need not be very powerful to recognize likely plaintexts.

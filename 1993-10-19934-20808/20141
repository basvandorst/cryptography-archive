     It seems to me that, rather than contributing to excessive proli-
feration of news groups, it would be better to preserve sci.crypt for
its original purpose.  Given that the noise level is so high because
certain thoughtless persons insist on posting non-science articles to
science news groups, and given that Peter is proposing creation of a
moderated group anyway, the logical solution is to change the status
of sci.crypt from unmoderated to moderated in order to enforce the
chartered purpose of sci.crypt.
     There are already plenty of groups to discuss the non-science
matters.  We don't need to allow a sci. group to be turned into some-
thing else while retaining sci.crypt as a misnomer.  It would be
better to moderate sci.crypt to get the interlopers to go where they
belong.  It seems obvious that research matters belong in sci.crypt,
whereas legal discussions do not.  Running away from the noise by
creating a new group, while leaving the noise in a sci. group is not
the answer and would tend to encourage the same sorts of noise prob-
lems for other sci. groups in the future.
     Moderation is the answer.  New group creation is unnecessary in
this situation.

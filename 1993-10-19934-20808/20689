I just found out there is a plan afoot to seed modified copies
of PGP around, one that contains a trapdoor and an imbedded 
secret flag (within some part of the exchange).  This is *not*
being done by any government agency rather some folks: 
I've heard about who want to pull a big joke on people.

If you get a copy of PGP make sure you know where it came from!

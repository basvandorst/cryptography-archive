There already is a legal PGP. The one that exists on the
internet now. Simply because NSA or US State want to hang
Zimmermann doesn't make PGP illegal. The only threat is from the
possibilty of an illegal export having occured. By whom has yet
to be demonstrated.

As far as RSA having any kind of claim against a holder
of PGP, nailing rsaref to the telephone poles all over the world 
kind of removes any obligation, especially when permission for 
free and unlimited use is allowed as long as you don't SELL it.
Why, that kind of blows away any possible legs to stand on.

And of course, putting it ANYWHERE on the internet is
the same as nailing it on the telephone pole. But RSA didn't put it just
anywhere, they put it in their PUBLIC ftp host. After all, electromagnetic 
radiation doesn't adhere to any human laws.

Shalom,

JBB.

they're liable to end up in the local sale ring.

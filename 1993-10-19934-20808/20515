You might want to start by reading the FAQ lists for this group; they
make a good primer.

First of all, if it's not key based, then it's not a cipher.  So
asking for a 'key based encryption algorithm' is kind of like asking
for a 'two wheeled bicycle'.

Anyway -- modern ciphers operate on binary data to produce binary
data.  If you want to turn the output into printable ASCII, then use
'uuencode' or something similar.

I suggest you try DES, or Triple-DES if you're worried about being
snooped on by big governments and corporations.

Some good sources are mentioned in the FAQ; I would also suggest the
'alodes' package from 'kampi.hut.fi'.

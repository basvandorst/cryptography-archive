Those considerations led me to write my encryption software so
that it accepts:
a: ascii "password"
b: bytes from file "@filename,offset"
c: encrypted bytes from file "!filename,offset"
d: md5 hash "#ascii"

so that, even if I use only ascii passwords, anyone that could be
in position to hack my code would know that my passwords range over
the entire realm.

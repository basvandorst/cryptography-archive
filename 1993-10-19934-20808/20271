I read an article about the proposed backpack codes (long since discarded,
but never mind) in which the backpack integers were to be just the powers
of two (with a little random prefix and suffix) multiplied by some number
r, modulo q.  They could be unscrambled by multiplying by s modulo q,
where q = r*s-1.  All of the subsequent attacks on the system involved
solving the backpack problem (which needn't concern us here) instead of
figuring out r and s.  I don't understand why this form of attack
wasn't used; the table of powers of 2 provides some plaintext for such
an attack, and like all public key systems, the cryptanalyst can generate
as much chosen plaintext as they like.

So:  Is ciphertext = plaintext * r (mod) (r*s-1)  a strong cryptosystem?

If not, why was it to be the basis of this public-key system, and why did
all attacks on the public-key system concentrate on the esoteric backpack
problem?

Related,

About 2 years ago I knew someone who worked in AI, for fun he developed
a password cracker using some ruleset, running under msdos. It was quite
neat, unfortunately I knew little AI and it was sufficiently long ago
that I forget just about everything about it. Of course, it was probably
learning which words are more probable as opposed to being able to break
DES (he seemed to thing that he could possibly get it to move into this
area). I wonder what he is doing now ...

Fun stuff anyway. Sorry if its off-topic slightly :)

Matthew.

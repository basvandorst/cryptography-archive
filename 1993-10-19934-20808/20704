	It seems there are advantages to being the 51st state.

	Gaaaaa.  I have no idea what NT uses.  I'm running NetBSD at
	home, and was just wondering if I can take the security package
	with me if and when I move....  I also need to know if I can put
	a DES version of xdm up for anon ftp in Canada

	I have seen implmentations in South Africa and Norway pretty
	recently, so I would suspect that it's pretty commonly found out
	there...

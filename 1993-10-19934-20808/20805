Just thought I'd share a little something I ran across in a
little paper-back published in London a few years ago:

-  "................In a recent Horizon TV program (in which I
-  appeared), James Bamford, an authority on the NSA, stated that
-  the Agency could break a 56-bit DES key in half a day, at a cost
-  to the US taxpayer of only 50 dollars......."
-
-                     George Sassoon, The Radio Hacker's Code Book
-                                     Gerald Duckworth & Co,  1986

Since this was on nearly TEN YEAR OLD computers, anyone care to
guess what the figures would be today? Anyone have any more credible
a source than Bamford, as reported by Sassoon?

By the way, this is a very interesting little book!

I posted a description back in January 1991. I wonder if there's enough
interest that it should go into the FAQ. Some references: Robert J.
McEliece, Theory of Information and Coding, Addison-Wesley, 1977, for
Goppa coding and decoding, with credit to Nicholas Patterson, Algebraic
Decoding of Goppa Codes, IEEE Trans. IT 21 (1975), 203-207; and Sloane's
article in David A. Klarner, The Mathematical Gardner, Wadsworth, 1981.

Someone posted a concise implementation in April 1992. See article 5317
of the wuarchive alt.sources archives, or article 8007 of the rpub.msu
sci.crypt archives.

Depends who you believe. In Eurocrypt '91 two Russians claimed to have
broken the system. A few of us on sci.crypt tried out the implementation
but lost interest after we heard that it had been broken. On the other
hand I don't know anyone who's seen the Russian algorithm; nor do I know
a reference for it.

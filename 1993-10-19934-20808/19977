The version of 2.3A version of PGP source code on the Moby Crypto
distribution does not have the zip.h file so it cannot be compiled.

It is intended solely for educational and research purposes only and not
to violate anyone's property rights nor any law prohibiting the export
of crypto devices without a license.  Moby Crypto cannot by itself
encrypt a single bit of data.

You are using special pleading.  You have to assume that the enemy
knows the entire cryptosystem, your padding/extraction technique
included.  

Time and time again, people have made your mistake in real life, and
gotten screwed for it.  If we know ANYTHING about crypto, it's that
the secrecy of the system has to depend ONLY on the keys, and not on
expecting that the enemy will be ignorant of some detail or other of
the cryptosystem.

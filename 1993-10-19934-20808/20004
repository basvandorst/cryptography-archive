The ITAR rules are NOT understandable, to the point of being
unconstitutionally overbroad and vague.  The many shades of gray
between a crypto discussion by voice and executable code, including
scholarly work and publications, are just not properly accounted for.

A good crypto program requires more than good crypto, but just the good
crypto part is really easy.  Writing a DES program from the description in
published works available world wide is about a high school exercise.

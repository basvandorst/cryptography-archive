	Or we might wait until after the federal prosecutors have
initiated a massive, inflamatory and distracting campaign of media
disinformation and weaken the chances of winning any appeals outcome.

	Dammit, don't wait at all. Start with as much information as
possible to as many outlets as possible. Initiate a national debate
around privacy and the undesirability of BIG BROTHER telling us how to
live.

	I think we all know what there up to.

	Yah, just wait. There's sure to be a sympathetic judge hiding
out there, somewhere, but not where the prosecutor puts the case.

	Shalom,

	JBB.

But *I* have read XIIIb.  And *if* source software is unclassified
technical data, then my source of PGP certainly is *public domain*
technical data because it was *published* and available to the public
through subscriptions which are available without restriction
to any individual who desires to purchase or obtain the
published information.  So did *you* read 120.11 or what part
of the word *publish* do you not understand, Mr Barney?

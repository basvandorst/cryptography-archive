I am working on a project currently (for final year project) that adds
enhanced security features to Microsoft Mail (for Mac). Such features are a
secure server that acts as a trusted key distributor. A improved secure logon
as the Microsoft Packet data may as well been plaintext for the simple method
they used to transmit the users password to the Microsoft Server.
We are also offering different mail encryption options as well as digitial
signatures etc. We have not attempted to create any of our own cryptographic
algorithms. Why would we want to when there are those that are already
implement and far more secure than anything we could dream up in the single
year we have had to work on the project.

But basically we have loki, idea, md5, and we are looking to use rsa.
Now this program is in no way a commercial product. But it seems that rsa
is difficult to come by unless it has been implemented outside the USA.

I have seen PGP, but the RSA implementation there seems to me to be pretty
bound to there key formats, keyfiles etc. I am just after the bare basics
and I was unsuccessful trying to use the pgp rsa. I dont want to have to
implement rsa for myself if it is possible (time also doesn't allow it).
If anyone could help me find a bare bones implementation of RSA or point me
in the right direction. I would be eternally gratefull. I have also seen a
german implementation (unfortunately I can't read german) it seems to be
more what I am after though. If anyone has translated this version I wouldn't
mind a copy.

Thanx in advance.

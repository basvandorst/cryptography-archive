In the same vein;

   It looks like prior restraint, acts like prior restraint, has the
essential features of prior restraint. Summary, the first amendment
will be hazardous to its health.

   Anybody reasonably skilled in the art can read Numerical Recipes in
C, and Knuth, and construct some reasonably secure crypto (triple DES)
using RSA for key exchange.

   Here in Ontario Canada, speeding is a way of life. Everybody does it.
On highway 400, the average speed will be between 130 and 140 KPH. (About
80 to 85 MPH). Some 5% of the cars will be going faster than this. The
posted limit is 100 KPH. In the last 5 years, I've driven over 100,000
miles -- easily half of which were driven at least 10 KPH over the limit.
I have never been caught -- why? because the cops always have someone
else pulled over when I pass them -- and I make sure there's always
another car nearby going a bit faster than I am.

   So while you're correct in saying that breaking the speed limit won't
raise it, if everyone does it, effectively it becomes unenforced except
in the most blatant cases of violation, and even then only rarely.

P.S. I like that -- Mono-Digital Signaling. Sounds like part of the title
of a communications paper -- "Enhancing Communications Bandwidth
using Mono-Digital Signaling Techniques" :-)

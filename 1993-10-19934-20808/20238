I originally posted this on comp.os.ms-windows.announce, and someone suggested
that I cross post to this newsgroup, so here it is:

----------

I have just uploaded a copy of DigSig v1.1 to ftp.cica.indiana.edu. 
DigSig is a digital signature calculation and management package for
Windows 3.1 and above. DigSig has the following features:

* Calculates file signatures using MD4, MD5 or SHS
* Store signatures in database for future reference
* Will print a signature on letters that you send
* Contains complete reference information for the methods used
* Source code supplied on registration

As with all my programs, I appreciate any and all correspondence that I
receive from users. Thanks.

The pathname is /pub/pc/win3/uploads/digsig.zip

Check the Gutenburg Project. They are engaged in entering large numbers of 
documents, including classic books. There should be more text than you know
what to do with.

ftp to mrcnext.cso.uius.edu, log in anonymous, look for /pub/etext (or 
maybe /etext). It also should appear in your Gopher as Electronic Books.

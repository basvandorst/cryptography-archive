No - but only after decryption.

Yes.

PGP already does that. It first signs the message and then encrypts
it. Therefore, you can't see the signature without decrypting the
message. As opposed to it, PEM puts the detached signature in a
message header, for everybody to see it. Also, with PGP you can
encrypt with the public key of the recepient without signing the
message. This is sometimes necessary - there -are- messages which must
be both anonymous and private. PEM doesn't allow this.

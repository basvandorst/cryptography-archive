    If it's your first version.  If you already have a version that you
trust, just make sure that the signature file on the new version is intact
and matches the executable.  I've gone through three versions now, (one of
which I FTP'd from Italy, the other from the UK), and all three of them
agree on the signatures of the other two.  Any new version that comes out
is going to get caught the instant it gets proofed the first time, and the
folks that uploaded it better hope that they were -really- good at keeping
themselves anonymous :)

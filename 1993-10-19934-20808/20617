A friend said he knows someone who wants to try to decrypt the data that
is transmitted to police vehicles on their Mobile Data Terminals (MDT's),
but he is concerned that under the ECPA (Electronic Communications
Privacy Act) it is illegal.  

According to ECPA people aren't supposed to intercept encrypted
transmissions.

My question: is it illegal to decrypt, or try to decrypt communications
such as this?
If it isn't illegal to try to decrypt it, is it still illegal to
interecept the communications?

I'm trying to do a little research on something I've heard about some
relatively new crypto device that is supposed to be so amazing that the
government has been trying to impose their power to get a piece of the action.

I'm finding very little help at the library since (a) it's a fresh topic, and
(b) our library at A&M sucks.  I realize that if i dig through the newsgroups
here, i might get somewhere, but at the moment i have to run take care of some
other stuff.  Anyway, any information you might have to get me started in the
right direction would be a major help.  And, i'd rather you wrote directly to
my e-mail address rather than replying to the newsgroup.

Thanks in advance-
T. Smith

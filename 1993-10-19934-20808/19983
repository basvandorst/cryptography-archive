I don't understand this viewpoint. It isn't much harder to pick a __GOOD__
password, that pretty much requires searching 96^^8 keys, than it is to pick
an O.K. password. Both are harder jobs than picking a pathetic password, of
course. This isn't just a theoretical claim; at a previous job, I got the
permission of management to install a replacement for passwd(1) that
enforced the following rules:

	all passwords must be at least 8 characters long
	in the first 8 characters, they must include at least one each of
		uppercase
		lowercase
		numeric digits
		punctuation marks

I used Matt Bishop's passwd replacement, and it worked fine. Then I
required everyone to change their password within the next week, by grabbing
a copy of /etc/passwd, and `*'-ing out any accounts whose password hadn't
changed a week later. Out of a population of some 300 people, ranging from
engineers to clerical types to physicians, only ONE (1) person claimed to be
unable to live with these rules; this one person insisted on being permitted
to pick a password that didn't require hitting the shift key. So for him, I
temporarily relaxed the uppercase requirement. Further, I didn't get any
more folks coming in having forgotten their passwords than you'd ordinarily
expect, maybe a couple per year. I don't know how many wrote their passwords
down, and I don't particularly care. Inside jobs are easy many other ways;
the real threat is attack over the network, and passwords written down
doesn't make that easier.

Sure, passphrases are better. They require modifying every program that
authenticates against /etc/passwd strings, where password choice
restrictions can be put in place by just replacing _one_ program.

Here I disagree. The online file has to contain all the _current_ passwords
(since in the future they will be among the old passwords:-), and having
passwords stored online, even in a file that is supposed to be
non-world-readable, is a __BAD__ idea. Trivially, it allows anyone who
briefly gets privileges to then acquire all the passwords. Say someone walks
away from a ``# '' prompt for a few minutes.... Even if you code it so the
current password doesn't get logged into the history file until the moment
you change it, a log of past passwords is still excellent material for
producing well-chosen guesses at current passwords.

Greetings:

I have a question, which has been nagging at me for a while.

Would it not be, in addition to using all the other crypt methods
described, be an almost foolproof way of making sure that somethign will
not be decode, if one did the following:

        Assuming the message takes up 5-10 characters, increase the size
        of a message by a factor of 10 or 100, with the rest being total
        random garbage. In a sense, burying the message in noise, and
        given that the recipient needs only to pluck a few characters
        out, using some old "1940's" method, it would be very difficult
        for someone not knowing that to comprehend it, even if he
        somehow managed to break all the other encruption schemes?

I have a question for all you DES experts out there:


In FIPS 46 DES, the key schedule is computed using the following sequence
of shifts:

1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 1
  ^           ^

Now, if the two shifts indicated above were switched, we would end up with:

1 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 1


This version of DES would have the interesting property that

E(M, K) = D(M, K)

which implies that


E(E(M, K), K) = M       and       D(D(M, K), K) = M


This version could be considered useful in the sense that the EXACT same
algorithm could be used for encrypting and decrypting (not that switching 
the order of the subkeys is a big deal to begin with).  Intuitively, this seems
like a bad idea - introducing extra symmetry into the algorithm.  I could not,
however, come up with a CONCRETE reason why this shouldn't be done (i.e. a way
in which an attacker could use this information to "crack" a ciphertext more
quickly).  Since this symmetry isn't present, I assume IBM and NSA had a good
reason not to include it.  Does anybody know of a concrete reason why this
particular symmetry was not introduced into DES?  Either posted or mailed
responses would be great.


Thanks,

   I was rather impressed by this secton of this excellent book.  I have  a 
   couple of questions: was this the first example of  machine encryption
   by the equivalent of transforming individual bits of a byte?
   
   The second question has to do with the attack on the machine.  The 
   narrative is rather matter-of-fact (someone took a few message,
   went away for a few weeks, and came back with the wirings) but
   it sounds like an impressive achievement.  Was this a new attack or
   or was it derived from what had been learned from the cryptanalysis
   of  ENIGMA?  Was it as impressive as I think it is?

That isn't my theory. It is that unless the grand jury returns an indictment
it's just an inquiry.

If they do we are into some serious stuff.

Meanwhile if Phil is in fact the target than all those hysterical messages
from Grady were crying wolf for nothing since Grady would not be the target
and the inquiries are fact-finding about Phil, not Grady. That was exactly
what I suggested (without the specifics) several messages ago--that the
subpoenaed orginizations were such for fact-finding, not because they were a
target, but that some third party (we now seem to know Phil) was the target.

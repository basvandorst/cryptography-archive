I remember reading about a method of using MD5 and similar hash functions
as ciphers. Does anyone know where to get code or a description of this?
How does it work? How strong are the resulting ciphers?

One method (but how secure?) would seem to be:
prepend 16 bytes of random data to the beginning of the plaintext
MD5 the passphrase
XOR the resulting hash with the first block (the random data) of the
plaintext, generating the first block of the ciphertext
MD5 the passphrase plus the first block of the ciphertext
XOR to generate the second block
repeat for each block

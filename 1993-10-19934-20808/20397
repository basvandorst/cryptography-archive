In Australia, 1949, there was a murdered body found dressed in a suit.
All the clothing labels were removed and all the pockets were empty,
except for a piece of paper with the words" Tamman Shad" written on it.

It is an unsolved crime and the police could not identify the body.

However, after some research, it was found that the words "Tamman Shad"
come from the book: "The Rubayat of Omar Khyam."

The day after the murder a nearby doctor mysteriously found  a copy of
Omar Khyam on the back seat of his car. A piece was torm out of the book and the
tear perfectly matched the "Tamman Shad" paper.

At the back of the book there was a hand written code.

Can someone post the code or suggest a reference where it could be looked up?

Also does anyone know if the code was ever cracked?

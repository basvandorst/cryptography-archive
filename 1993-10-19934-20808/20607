I am not aware of the existence of any trojanized version of PGP. It's
very easy to produce one, however, so you should always check the
authentication of any new versions you get. The checking must be done
using an older and trusted version of the program. Each distribution
of PGP contains enough information to authenticate the package, so
that if it happens to be trojanized, you'll know that the tampering
has been done by the authors... :-)

However, the old versions have bugs. Version 2.2 can trash your hard
disk if you run it under MS-DOS or any other OS without memory
protection. Version 2.3 had a bug which caused it to fail to verify
some clearsigned messages. Version 2.3A is the latest and I am not
aware of any serious bugs in it, although it has a bunch of buglets
and lack of features, which will probably be fixed in the future
version.

Vesselin

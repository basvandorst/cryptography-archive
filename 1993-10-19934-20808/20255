If they can break A5 that easily, why did they need to introduce A5X?  The
(not very technical) articles I've seen say A5 would take GCHQ a couple of
months to break and A5X a couple of hours.  BTW, I assume those estimates
are based on devoting full resources to one call - with around a million
cellular calls in the UK a week at present if A5 takes off they would have to
be *very* selective.

The reason GCHQ can afford to let GSM have reasonably good encryption is
that it isn't end-to-end, only mobile to base-station.  The base-station
to land-line link is in clear, as is the base-station to base-station link
used when two mobiles communicate (even if it's the same base-station).  All
they need to do to listen in is to get a warrant to tap the base-station.

Dunno where you get this from.  The early GSM phones have no crypto, but
later models get A5 built in (with an A5X base-station they revert to clear).
Newer models will be A5X aware and switch according to base-station
capability.

We have a small government over here and no grand juries - maybe that
explains it...  It's certainly true that whilst you have law-enforcement
agencies demanding a bigger war on drugs (they have their cushy jobs to
consider) ours keep advising the government to decriminalise (they don't have
the budget).

I can moderate it if there's a demand for sci.crypt.research.  Since I'm 
located in a country which doesn't generally get intimidated by the US govt, 
and whose branch of the NSA don't even like to admit they exist, there's 
little chance of any problems.
 
However since the principal task of any moderator will be to act as noise 
filter, how about having multiple moderators with people submitting postings 
to whoever's closest, much like the submission process to the editors of 
technical journals.  As long as the moderator collective maintains a 
reasonably uniform standard of junk rejection I can't see any problems, and 
there could be advantages to having at least two moderators, one in the US 
and one in a location free of any US govt. influences.

If s.c.r does eventuate we can always send the NSA, GCHQ, ASIO, GCSB, etc a
polite note inviting them to participate :-).

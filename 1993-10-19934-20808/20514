I heard a discussion about a book on Radio National last week in which this
case was discussed. It was treated in the discussion as a real event. I do
not have the references but the book is available in Australian bookstores
now. Someone might know the title but I don't recall it. It is a mixture of
fact and fiction. A number of unsolved Australian crimes are given
fictitious solutions by Australian writers. This was one of the cases so
treated.

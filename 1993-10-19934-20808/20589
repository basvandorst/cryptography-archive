I'm not sure just what you mean by a multi-*n*ode fiber as opposed to
multi-*m*ode.  Could you explain this?

I would think the easiest thing to use would be a single-mode fiber since
that way any photon that gets through has taken a known amount of time.
In a multi-mode fiber you don't know which optical path a photon has taken,
just that it has gotten there.

Regardless of whether you use a phase-coherence system or a polarization
based system there will be some limit on how far you can transmit based
on the attenuation in the fiber.  The more transparent it is, the farther
you can propagate single photon states.

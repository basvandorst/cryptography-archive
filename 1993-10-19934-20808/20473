Well, one obvious test seems to get ignored: does the inventor have
any experience cracking ciphers?

How much time do you want to waste analyzing the nth novice effort
with sixty-eight LFSRs with linearly-prime periods that shifts the
contents of a register that is XORed with a repeating password that is
braided with the plaintext and two pseudorandom data streams which are
generated by PRNGs which are left to be specified by the user?

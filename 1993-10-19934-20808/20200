My initial reaction was extreme surprise that personal privacy had
overridden the plaintive cries of the security services, but this
soon gave away to curiosity: just what is A5, and it's insecure
counterpart, A5X?  I recalled the discussion about the British GCHQ's
reaction to A5, although I don't ever recall seeing any references
at all to the design of this cryptosystem.  Does anyone have any
information about the structure of A5 and A5X, or pointers to where
I could find it?

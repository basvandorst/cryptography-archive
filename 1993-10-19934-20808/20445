I think instead of amusing yourself by poking fun at Mykotronx you should  
asking yourself is there a lesson to be learned.  All of us could be the  
target of industrial espionage in the future.  Attacks are not limited to  
mere rifling of garbage.  They can include bugging offices, theft of data,  
or in Vesselin's field an attack on corprate databases with a virus.  Just  
because it happened to a company you don't like doesn't mean it can't  
happen to you.  I find it ironic that a person who is so upset by  
government "spying" would indulge in espionage.  I suppose the ends are  
suppoed to justify the means.

"By God Colonel!  We had to destroy the village to make it safe for  
democracy!"

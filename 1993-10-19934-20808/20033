It used to be the case that credit card companies insisted that the shipping
address for `customer not present' orders (phone/mail) must match the
card-holder's address, although this is no longer rigidly observed.  So
you would have to use the recipient's card number for a malicious prank like
that.  You certainly wouldn't want to use your own card number because it is
then obvious who the perpetrator is and the shipping company may claim
incidental costs for delivery/uplift.  A third-party stolen number is
possible but adds extra complications, whereas using the recipient's own
number will cause them difficulties when they try to repudiate the order.

Yes.  I made up the system off the top of my head, trying to make it
as complicated as possible.  Novices frequently associate complexity
with security, thinking that the more complex it is, the harder it
will be to invert.  This isn't really true.

Try looking in the FAQ for references.  I'll try to evaluate some of
these when I have time, since I admit I can't supply page numbers.

For now, look here:

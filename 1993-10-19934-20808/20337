Sure, it's easy to defeat.  So's a known-plaintext.  If I compress before
encryption, you probably won't know how whatever small bit of plaintext
you were going to key your search engine to turned out.  (Assmuing the
proper choice of a compression algorithm).  And if I triple-DES, the
attacker may as well get a new job, since brute-force will never be
able to peel off the outside layer.  If we've settled anything here,
it's that brute-force machines are _not_ very useful, due to the fact
that messages can be easily be protected from them.

My technique could easily be implemented in parallel.

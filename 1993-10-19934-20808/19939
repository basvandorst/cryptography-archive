 E³      Abuse of "no knock" warrants, in fact any use of no knock
 E³ warrants or procedures absent evidence of a crime actively in process
 E³ is an unreasonable search.  Taking of property for no other reason
 E³ than to prevent the accused from defending himself in court is (IMHO)
 E³ an unreasonable seizure.  The government must be very sensitive to
 E³ these issues.  An accusation of unreasonable search or seizure, of
 E³ course, is not evidence that one occured.  But failure to justify
 E³ these tactics, immediately, and in open court is, on its face,
 E³ evidence of government conspiracy.  It may only be a conspiracy of
 E³ silence, but that can be just as bad as an "active" conspiracy.

 E³      We will see this week whether the Treasury Department is going to
 E³ deal properly with the crimes committed by BATF in the Waco disaster.
 E³ (I'm not talking about the fire, just the initial shootout. AFAIK,
 E³ there was no "no knock" warrant, and no law under which the BATF could
 E³ be granted one.)  Anyone want to bet that any criminal excesses are
 E³ not all blamed on the agents who died, or that something worse happens
 E³ to the higher ups than censure or forced resignation?  I'm not holding
 E³ my breath.

Robert: the original was not a "no-knock" warrant. I have a copy of the
original @ FatherNet BBS (718) 494-1719 PCBoard 15.0 USR-DS 16.8K
         Just make initial call *after* 8 PM Eastern because
         there's immediate callback verification.
         Just type " newuser " at the prompt.

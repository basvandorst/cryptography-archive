Is this innocous registration free, or does it cost hundreds of dollars
or more per year, selectively imposed only on certain businesses, to
just be allowed to pursue ones business, mainly because the government
doesn't like it or the business operators very much?  Does one give up
rights by so registering?

Is this list of items clear and explicit, or is it a list that is pretty
much interpreted as the goverment pleases?

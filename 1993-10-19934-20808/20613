   ***********************************************************
   Cryptography Day at IBM Yorktown           October 28, 1993
   Thomas J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights New York
   ***********************************************************
 
Once the province of diplomats and spies, cryptography is assuming
a central role in civil applications, including digital telephony,
electronic mail, database access, software copy protection, funds
transfer and contract negotiation.  As these services become
more powerful and globally integrated, cryptographic techniques
provide the chief means of reconciling the conflicting goals of
privacy and accessibility.  This day-long symposium will explore
the emerging intersection of cryptographic algorithms, devices,
applications, and policy that is shaping the future of
information services.
 
Topics to be covered include
 
+ A survey of cryptography and related techniques
+ The role of cryptography in information distribution and licensing
+ Electronic privacy
+ Smart cards
+ Evolution of the regulatory framework and international standards
 
 
Speakers include
 
Richard Barth           Council on Competitiveness, Washington, DC
Gilles Brassard         Universite de Montreal, Canada
Whitfield Diffie        Sun Microsystems, Sunnyvale, CA
Charles Hartman         IBM Personal Systems Multimedia, Mountain View, CA

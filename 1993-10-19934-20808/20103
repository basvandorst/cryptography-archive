What's the big deal?  There is no law of man or nature that requires you
to use the encryption algorithm that PEM says you should, even if your
headers say you do.  You have already arranged to exchange your
non-standard keys.  Simply use them with your non-standard algorithm, but
with the PEM headers.  Mail headers are not a binding contract that require
you do encode your text in any particular way.  (Except when lying confuses
intermediate computers and causes your mail to not be delivered--not
relevant here).

Assuming PEM is secure, how is anyone but those who are not collecting
your money going to know that you are cheating?  Why would anyone but
you and your correspondents care?

There might be some hassle from Public Key Partners wanting to collect
money from you for using they stuff.  It seems plausible that showing the
court the source for your mail user agent that does not use the standard
encrpytion, and demonstrating that it works with trail keys, would
be sufficient.

If you don't like all of that, then simply write and publish an ad hoc
standard using X- headers.  If you want it to catch on, include source
for a mail user agent.  (A good place to start might be the source to
Berkeley Mail, freely available in the various free-BSD releases, and
freely redistributable with the Berkeley copyright.)

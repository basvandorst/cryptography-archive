Thanks for the description and the references.

So, the problem is how to avoid such keys in PGP and the other
encryption programs that rely on IDEA.

Nevertheless, people will turst the encryption more, if it is known
that no weak keys can be generated at all.

Unfortunately, as far as I understand, this requires a modification of
the encryption algorithm. That should be avoided, for several reasons.
Isn't there a way to recognize that a key is weak and to simply reject
it (i.e., to generate a new one)?

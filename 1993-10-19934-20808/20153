 Actually, it would be more surprising if we *did* know such
 strength, since there exists no "real way of knowing how strong"
 virtually *any* cipher is.

 Perhaps you would like to give us your estimate of the probability
 that any selected cipher would "undo" or "weaken" a preceding
 cipher to any realistic extent.  For example, suppose we double
 encipher with DES under two different keys:  What is the probability
 that the ciphertext would be the same as the plaintext, or even
 any simple transformation of the plaintext?  Now suppose that the
 second cipher is *not* DES:  What is the probability that a cipher
 not structured like DES would undo DES?

 Because otherwise you wouldn't have stopped designing.

 The planet you live on needs to discover reality.  Failure to break
 a cipher is negative information only, and it supports no valid
 implication.  A lack of knowledge about how to successfully break
 a cipher in no way precludes the possibility that the cipher *has*
 been broken.  Even the failure of many attempts does not mean that
 the cipher cannot be broken by people with less than a given level
 of experience or training or resources.  It just means that one
 does not know.  Even if a cipher is only known to be breakable at
 great expense, we normally do not know that it cannot be done
 cheaper.  Perhaps a planet-wide refresher course would be in
 order on "the limits of experimentation in determining reality."

 With a new cipher, The Opponent is simply has not had the time to
 invest the massive effort into cryptanalysis which must be assumed
 when using a long-known and widely-used cipher.  Consequently, new
 ciphers carry a distinct security advantage over old ciphers.

 If one wishes to have the best of both worlds, data can be ciphered
 through both a new cipher *and* an old-but-respected cipher, albeit
 at the processing cost of each.

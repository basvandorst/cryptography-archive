   One million and counting....

Ooops.  I really must avoid posting articles while tired and feeling
ill.  There were two typos (at least) in my article:

I wrongly said:

   Because we still have relatively few cycles, it is difficult to give
   an accurate estimate of how much further we have to go.  However, I
   can give a guestimate which won't be too far out.  We know from
   previous large-scale runs of MPQS, that the final total consists of
   about 20% fulls and 80% cycles.  As we need something over half a
   million altogether, we can divide the number of cycles by one

Make that "... number of fuls by one"

   thousand, and call that the percentage completion.  Accordingly, my
   best estimate is that we are about 14% done.
...
   So, a big thank you to everyone who has contributed to the project so
   far.  Your help is much appreciated.  Anyone reading this who has not
   joined in yet, is invited to send email to rsa129-info@iastate for
   more information.  All you need is a Unix box with at least 8Mb of

And make that rsa129-info@iastate.edu

Apologies to all those I confused.  Still, a few dozen people managed to
deduce the missing ".edu".

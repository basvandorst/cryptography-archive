I've just implemented the SHS in assembler, but really need to test it with
more than the example 24-bit message in the NIST document on ripen.msu.edu.
So - is anyone willing to digest a couple of shortish messages, and e-mail
them to me with the uuencoded originals?

For anyone interested, about 7k of ARM2 code can digest about 90k/s. (Both
figures will improve 10-15% more.)

Indeed.

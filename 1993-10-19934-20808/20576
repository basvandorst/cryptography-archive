:   Why not use the following encryption algorithim:

: Person A takes out their copy of the book and turns to the specified page.

: Person A then takes the message and letter by letter translates it into some
: sort of numeric code (ASCII, A=1 B=2 C=3...).

: Person A then does the same thing with the book for the same number of
: characters.

: Person A then XOR's the numbers (with their own trusty pocket calculator) from
: the message with the numbers from the book.

: Person A then translates the XORed number back into characters.

: Person A transmits (gives) the cyphertext to Person B.

: Person B (to decrypt the message) follows all of the above steps in reverse.


: I welcome all comments and criticisms.

I think there are good book ciphers.
I believe that you can make a better cipher by using a book of
random numbers, even when the book is known.

If you xor the numbers of say, individual letters in sequence,
then this is supposed to be not secure.

Your description is not precise enough for me to say exactly
what the weaknesses may be.

Maybe yours is the kind of simple system that could benefit from
being analyzed by a program. That is, run your ciphertext through
some statistical tests. They could very well be able to find some
weakness.

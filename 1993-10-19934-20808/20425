Reasonable goal.

Good thinking.

  Have you considered using MD5 with a seed value that you keep
confidential ?  MD5 is publically available, not patent encumbered,
and might well do the trick.  MD5 is specified in an online RFC (which
see).  You will want to consider the performance issues in use of any
cryptographic hash function.

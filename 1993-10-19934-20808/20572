  Why not use the following encryption algorithim:

Person A and Person B exchange (secretly) the title and page number of some
printed material (i.e. book, document, newspaper (also exchanging date)).

Person A writes a plaintext message.

Person A takes out their copy of the book and turns to the specified page.

Person A then takes the message and letter by letter translates it into some
sort of numeric code (ASCII, A=1 B=2 C=3...).

Person A then does the same thing with the book for the same number of
characters.

Person A then XOR's the numbers (with their own trusty pocket calculator) from
the message with the numbers from the book.

Person A then translates the XORed number back into characters.

Person A transmits (gives) the cyphertext to Person B.

Person B (to decrypt the message) follows all of the above steps in reverse.


I welcome all comments and criticisms.

Thanks,

Last year's and this year's USENIX UNIX Security Symposium was sponsored
by USENIX in cooperation with CERT.  The ACM folks had planned to hold a
half-day workshop on the last day of this year's Symposium but they changed
their plans.

The goal of this Symposium is to bring together security practitioners, system
administrators, system programmers, and others with an interest in computer
security as it relates to networks and the UNIX operating system.

At this time, plans for the next USENIX UNIX Security Symposium haven't 
been made.  Announcements for this conference will posted to the CERT Tools
mailing list and to the comp.org.usenix newsgroup.

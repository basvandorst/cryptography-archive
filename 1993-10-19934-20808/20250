To be fair, people I've talked to believe this functionality is
adequately covered by Persona PCA hierarchies, in with the sender is
pseudonymous so there is still authentication (i.e. you can know
multiple messages originated from the holder of the same private key)
without it being tied to a specific person.  Whether this is
sufficient is something you can argue about, but just saying "PEM
doesn't allow this" is a half-truth.

Of course, without a network of anonymous remailers or something you
can't respond to a message if you don't know who it's from, which
distinctly limits the usefulness.

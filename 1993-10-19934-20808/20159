I don't know whether it was first, but I'll stick a target out to aim at:
my "Crypt 1.1" was marketed for the IBM PC in Aug 1982 by The Software
Toolworks and Norell Data Systems as part of the "Pack/Crypt" package.
Crypt did an XOR against a Tausworthe/Lewis/Payne PRNG (98 bytes of
feedback shift regs).  It was written in Toolworks C, and was a port of
the earlier HDOS and CP/M versions for the Heathkit H89, marketed by the
Toolworks in 1980.  The companion program Pack did Huffman compression on
individual files.

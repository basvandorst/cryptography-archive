Consider the sequence generated by the a linear congruence on a cyclic group
G(m) over the integers given by:

   x(k+1) = (a*x(k) + c) mod m

where c is relatively prime to m and a is a primitive root of G(m).
(Thus a^k generates G.)

If m is large (say >= 2^64), is it "difficult" to determine x(k) given
a, c, m, and x(k+1)? The only algorithm that I can come up with is the 
following:

Load x(k+1) into an unsigned double-width register with the upper half zeroed 
out.  Subtract c from the register pair. Compute the remainder modulo a. If 
this remainder is zero, then the lower half of the register contains x(k) else
subtract m from the register pair and continue until the remainder modulo a is 
zero. This could take a long, long, .... time.

Is there a better algorithm?

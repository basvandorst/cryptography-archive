As is often repeated: RIPEM has the capability (as an option) of 
using triple DES. There is no publically known way to break triple 
DES in a reasonable amount of time (112 bits of key material instead 
of 56 bits, so brute force attacks are really out of the question). 

Now, if you know of some serious weakness in triple DES, please tell 
us about it.

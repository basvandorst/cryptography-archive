Yet another masterpiece from the keyboard of
Christopher C. Lapp.  New readers to sci.crypt
may not be aware that the esteemed Mr. Lapp
posts five or six messages per year in this
vein, always containing his unusually conceived
notions of "values".

As a collector of oddments and lover of the bizarre,
I've been sweeping these up into a chronological
history of Mr. Lapp's unique musings.  Send mail
if you'd like a copy .... but, as Mr. Lapp would
warn you, only if you feel you can trust my value
system (I may be an agent of a Three Letter Organization
sent to Internet to trap unsuspecting proto-traitors).

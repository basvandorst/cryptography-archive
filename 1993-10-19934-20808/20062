/An error on my part with an imperfect example.  Maybe the registration
/of handguns is more appropriate (especially since the right to bear
/arms is another constitutionally protected right).  In many places
/registration is required, but rarely denied (felons, children, ...).

A worse analogy.  Many places registration is required, but always denied
(defacto ban), in others they are denied to all but those with the
'right' connections.  This is for LAW-ABIDING citizens with no negative
'history'.

The idea of having to get government permission to excercise a RIGHT
is repugnant - more so for a Constitutionally protected right.  That
makes it no longer a right, but a PRIVILEGE.  Unfortunately, our
government has developed a nasty habit of ignoring the Constitution whenver
it deems it expedient.

/If this example is less than perfect please consider the main point of
/my statement on its own merits.

I really see no analogy that makes this come out right.  It is an abuse,
pure and simple, IMO.

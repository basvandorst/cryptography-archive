If anyone could provide published sources of info along the
lines of storing the products of known primes for the use of
factoring other numbers, I'd be very grateful...

What I'm looking at is the fact that if you store
2 x 3 x 5 x 7 ...
and find the GCD of this number and a test number, it's rather
simple to check for primeness and the range of effectiveness 
will extend to the largest prime in the series squared...

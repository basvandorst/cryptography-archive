   No.  A contention that the United States Supreme Court has the
power to ultimately decide would be reasonable, but this is clearly a
case where "the people" will ultimately decide.  This is clearly a
situation where the weight of public opinion has the opportunity to
determine the final outcome.  Only if the public losses interest, or
is sufficiently divided will any court position be final, not to
mention the fact that for any criminal prosecution to succeed the
state has to convince two juries to see things their way.

   Just to make the chain clear: If Congress doesn't like the way the
courts interpret the law, they can change it. (Constitutional
ammendments are harder but possible.)  If the public doesn't like the
way Congress is acting, they can and do change its makeup.  Never
accept the argument that ANY part of the government has ultimate
authority.

Lots of good stuff deleted.

   When the above number [RSA129] was published, it was believed that it would
   take hundreds, if not hundreds of thousands of years to factor the
   number.  Since that time, people have found better methods to factor
   numbers.  More importantly, people are now able to use the idle cpu
   time of hundreds, if not thousands of computers to work on the problem
   in parallel.  If you can convince a million people to let you use
   their computers for free for 12hrs per day, you can factor these very
   large numbers fairly quickly.  

Actually, given only ten thousand you can do it in days, but the idea is
sound.

   By factoring this large number, it would show that in order for the
   RSA system to be really secure, you need to pick larger numbers than
   "just" 129 digits.  This isn't hard to do, but it slows down the
   encryption/decryption a little bit more.  Factoring a number that is
   twice as large (2 times the number, not 2 times as many digits) takes
   4 times as long (approx).  This means that if you had a 130 digit
   number, it would take 100 times as long to factor.  If it can be shown

Nope.  Factoring is much easier than that.  Rather than merely
multiplying by two for a four-fold increase in factoring time, the true
multiplier is closer to a *million*.  That is, you can increase the
number of digits by about 6 or 7.  This assumes current algorithms, of
course, and that the extrapolations aren't over too big a range.

   that it is technically possible to factor a 129 digit number, people
   will just pick 150 or 200 digit numbers instead.

150-digit numbers are on the verge of being crackable at sensible cost.
The current state of the art is 130-digits; the larger ones are about a
hundred times more expensive.  200-digit is safe for a while yet.

   So, this is mostly an academic exercise to prove how that it is now
   possible to factor numbers in the 129 digit range.  There is also a
   $100 prize, but I doubt that the money is the motivating factor for
   anyone.  

The fame and the glory are far more important than the fortune!
The prize money, should we win it, will be donated to the GNU project.
Attempting to split it equably between the participants would be an
exercise of monumental futility.

Guten Tag!

Are there any detailed informations about IDEA encryption available on the net?
I am especially interested in the following three topics:

(1) I hear that some institution in Switzerland has some patent on the IDEA
    algorithm. Who is that? How would that affect me in Germany? How do I
    contact this institution?

(2) Is there any article about the design and implementation of IDEA available?
    Is it on the net? If not please give me detailed references.

(3) I consider IDEA as a more secure and faster alternative to DES. Are there
    other encryption algorithms which are running fast (without specifying
    "fast" more exact)?

Any information will be appreciated. Thank you for your help!

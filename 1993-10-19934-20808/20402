I can only quote my own experience when developing a stream 
cipher:
 
We were using 31-bit and 32-bit linear feedback shift registers 
(LFSRs) and a 32-input multiplexer as a non-linear combiner. (see 
Beker and Piper, Cryptography, Dover Press).  
 
We were surprised to find that the resultant keystream contained 
a high proportion of runs of 1's and 0's.  Thus the numbers of 
bytes containing all 1's or all 0's were 50% above average - an 
intolerable situation in cryptographic terms.  
 
The outputs of the LFSRs were not biased at all, and after much 
juggling of the configuration we managed to improve its 
performance somewhat.
 
This sort of experience, it seems to me, is as valid as a 
successful outcome - and should be catalogued so that others can 
be discouraged from making the same mistakes.
 
Essentially, our researches would have been helped substantially 
by a set of cryptographically oriented statistical analysis 
programs.

Keith Lockstone.

Well, you seem to be well roasted at this point.  Perhaps looking at this
from a different view might help.  By the way I agree with you fully.

Does anyone here send mail through any mail service with the envelope
marked "check enclosed" or "cash enclosed"?   Once the RFC is in place
it is very difficult to guess what it will be used for or with.  Right
now there is very high interest in the financial community in how to
deliver banking services to the customer via their PC's.  Should they
decide to use PEM, I'd really prefer that it not be announced to the 
world that my bank is sending me my statement or over-draft notice via
encrypted mail.  Worst still if they decide to use it to feed a customer
transaction processing system with it to pay bills and transfer money.

If you don't think this scenario is likely, remember these folks only
about 4 or 5 years ago finally encrypted all their cash machine links.
And even that happened only when the Feds mandated it.  Hopefully, the
Feds did mandate a certain level encryption that they would have to
implement.

If the RFC is correctly written, a corporation should be able to establish
an encrypted mail link with another corporation covering all transactions
between them.  These should be managable and visible only at the system
level and certainly not published.  I would envision maintaining many
different encryption systems, as agreed upon by each company dealt with,
with certain keys exchanged in out-of-band transactions.  This would allow
the use of existing global networks without installing dedicated circuits
to sites that would have minimal, but highly sensitive, traffic.
Likewise, individual users within these companies should be able to establish
yet another layer of personal encryption for their individual traffic when
desired or required.  

If the end result of this all is a data stream that is all ASCII mapped,
then anyone looking at would not have the slightest hint of where to begin
attacking what.  Double or triple encrypted sensitive technical or financial
data would look exactly like the CEO's exchanging Saturday's tee off time.

Definitely a huge waste of the processor, of course if your only doing
thirty messages per day, who cares.  What about those of us who might
want to do thirty to hundred thousand a day?

Well stated!

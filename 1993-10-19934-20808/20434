It depends a lot on the substitution scheme.
Without a substitution scheme, a simple chosen plaintext
attack is to flip a bit in the input, and see which bit
gets flipped in the output. From this it isn't very hard
to figure out the shifter and mask values.

If your substitution scheme is not key dependent (and
thus largely reversible by the attacker), I'm guessing, but
I think it could still be broken fairly easily.
Perhaps in order 64^(N-1) for an N-round system? I'd have
to think it through.

However, with a good key-dependent substitution scheme you
have pretty good immunity against differential cryptanalysis,
since the attacker can't attack any particular S-box - there
is no way to tell which S-box the flipped bits will end up in.

Remember that good substitution schemes are very hard to design
since there are any number of differential attacks they have to
defend against. As a rule, a DES-style cipher is nearly always
breakable in 4 rounds. It is only at 5+ rounds that the strength
of the substitution scheme begins to take effect. If you have
a very good scheme, you should be secure at 8 rounds.

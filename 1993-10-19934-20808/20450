I realize that this isn't the proper newsgroup for this question, but at 
the moment I am not subscribing to sci.math, so please indulge me this once.

I have a friend that needs a pointer to some codes for doing Monte Carlo
simulations, PD or otherwise. Please reply via email, since I'm sure this
isn't of general interest in this newsgroup.

Cheers,
	paul

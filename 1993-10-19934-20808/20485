USENET is a creative anarchy.  Sci.crypt is the central hub where
a lot of us meet and really important announcements should be made
here, IMHO.

The hearings being held in the US Congress are very likely to have
a substancial effect on the future of this science and its associated
industry.  Thus, they qualify as really important.

As someone pointed out in email, it's the billing company who really
has an interest in protecting the CC numbers, since they don't want to
get stuck with charges which are cancelled.  So, for the billing
company, PGP encrypted CC numbers do indeed make a lot of sense.  So
one does indeed wonder why the book company, which was supposedly
"computer literate", which took email orders, didn't support PGP or
some other form of encryption.

As to the ton of horse manure thing... it seems more-or-less
irrelavent to intercepting my credit-card.  If someone really wants to
send that to me, there's no particular need to use *my* credit card
for it, as oppossed to their own, or a third-party stolen number.

Yours, Lulu...

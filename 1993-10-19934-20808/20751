-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

I have two questions regarding security:
1. Given the system I am using in this message to add the sig within the
   message, would it facilitate a known-plaintext attack very much?

2. Does anyone know whether a PC connected to VMS and Unix machines
   through PATHWORKS can be accessed from the outside if no connection
   has been created through PERMIT. i.e. is PATHWORKS strictly one-way
   for file-access? If it isn't, I should disconnect from it during PGP
   signing activities.

Thanks for your attention,
M10

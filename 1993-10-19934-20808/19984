A agree.  A few days ago I was reading through my sci.crypt log of a few 
years ago and was truly depressed at how the quality of the material posted 
here has dropped since then.  Back then people would post ideas for ciphers, 
possible attacks, theory, whatever... now it's all export restrictions, the 
US constitution, and NSA conspiracies.  There were rumblings about a moderated
group a while back, but AFAIK nothing ever came of it.
 
Now comp.compression.research has just gone through the same process (the vote
is currently under way), however for some strange reason the S/N ratio improved
remarkably just before the CFV went out (they must have been afraid of the
consequences :-).
 
Can anyone give me any reason for *not* RFD'ing sci.crypt.research, a moderated
sci.crypt with a total ban on anything with export restrictions, the first
amendment, conspiracy theories, and Clipper in the message body?  I'm really
getting tired of the endless debate here, and I'd like to see some form of what
sci.crypt was a few years ago.  If there's no demand for s.c.m, I can try and
organise a mailing list for crypto people to supplant sci.crypt, although
obviously a public newsgroup would be better.  The current sci.crypt situation
really is depressing, I've got a few s.c.r-type postings half-written but
haven't really had any motivation for doing any more with them since they'll
just get lost in the noise...
 
Peter.

Note that informing someone that he is a "target" of a grand jury investigation
is a formal and important part of a criminal invention. It puts a witness on
notice that anything he tells the jury can and will be used against him. The 
warning is required by judges--it may be part of the formal Rules of Criminal
Procedure, but I'm no lawyer--to prevent an unintended waiver of Fifth
Amendment rights.

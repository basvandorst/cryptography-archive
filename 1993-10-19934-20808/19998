With most crypto schemes that are fairly secure (even DES) the average
attack will take many weeks. How will the attacker know you've changed your
password during his search?

And another thing. If your password HAS been cracked and you don't know it,
and you change it, the attacker has to start all over. Your correspondence
for the next few weeks will be secure until he hits your new password. If it
is only useful when "fresh", by then he will be reading old mail.

Finally, if the cracking period is a month for the average cracker (not
someone with an expensive special-purpose machine) and you change your
password every two weeks, there's a 50-50 chance he won't ever hit your
password no matter how often he repeats the search, if he's using a
deterministic, once-through search. That's much better odds than the
suggestion that it doesn't matter if you change it or not (which makes it
certain your password will be found) and thus it DOES matter and the
original poster was incorrect.

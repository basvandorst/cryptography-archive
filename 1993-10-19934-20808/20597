HoHoCon - December 19-21, Austin TX

Unfortunately all the others are too expensive for me, so I'll leave
that to others.  HoHoCon only costs $5!  (travel not included).
Prestige?  Dunno 'bout that.  Control?  We had to move to another
city, none of the Houston hotels would have us (when I say 'we', I do
not speak for dFx or cDc, the official sponsors of HoHoCon - I am
merely an independent attendee).  But I had a great time, & even
learned a few things.

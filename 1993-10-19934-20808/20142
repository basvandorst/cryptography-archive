Hardly. If you're talking about PGP in the U.S., for example, it's in the
hands of a tiny minority of people on various nets, and their friends, who
don't mind possibly infringing PKP's patents. Last time I looked there were
under a thousand PGP keys and even if we assume ten times that many use it
and haven't registered their keys, that's ten thousand out of well over 200
million Americans.

One of the central points in the whole ITAR discussion is the difference
between handling "secure" crypto in the hands of a few, which can be broken
with reasonable resources, and the same stuff used by millions routinely,
which would swamp the system.

(I refer, of course, to legal interception.)

Let's try this, once more, slowly.

You use the phrase ``register as a manufacturer of defense articles''
and the phrase ``register as an international arms dealer.''

You claim that, out of the people who have to ``register as a
manufacturer,'' only _some_ have to ``register as an international
arms dealer.''

But that's absolutely false. The State Department has only _one_ set of
registration requirements. It does _not_ require anyone to ``register as
an international arms dealer''; the phrase ``international arms dealer''
has no legal significance.

Your statement that ``You only have to register as an international arms
dealer if you export or import stuff on the control list'' has
_absolutely_ _no_ _relation_ to reality.

How about this:  Each player generates a large random number, computes
the MD5 hash, and then discloses the hash to the other players.
Each player is now committed to his number, since no ther number will
produce the same hash.  Then each player reveals his number to the others,
the result is summed (and optionally hashed again, if you like) and the result
mod 6 is the die roll.

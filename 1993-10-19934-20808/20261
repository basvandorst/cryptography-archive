This is a policy/legal/ethics/morality topic, not a technical
discussion.  As such it has no place in sci.crypt which is only for
the purely scientific/technical discussions.

Please move this and all other policy/legal/ethics/morality
discussions out of sci.crypt and into some more appropriate forum
(e.g. talk.politics.crypto).

Thanks

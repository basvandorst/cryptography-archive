As two people pointed out to me in private e-mail (they should have
posted it publicly), I was wrong (actually, I am surprised that Terry
didn't notice it - he should have known better). DES is a 
substitution-only cypher, using a very large alphabet. The
implementations use transpositions, but it does not depend on the key,
so it doesn't count.

The sentence "transposition cyphers are weak, substitution cyphers are
weak, but a production of the two may be strong" can be generalized as
"the production of several weak cyphers may be a strong cypher". And
indeed, DES could be considered as a production of several
substitution cyphers (the S-boxes), each of which uses a small
alphabet and is relatively weak.

Vesselin

Subject: Australian government to replace DES

Here is something I found in an Australian computer magazine, which
sounded like something for the Risks Forum...

Quoted from "PCWEEK October 20, 1993"

  The Australian Government has secretly developed its own data
  encryption firmware and algorithm, killing its dependence on the
  US DES (Data Encryption Standard) Algorithm.

  Called Seneca, the firmware element was developed as a joint project
  of the Defence Science and Technology Organisation (DSTO) in Adelaide
  and the Defense Signals Directorate (DSD) in Canberra.

  [...]

  "It is a symmetric encryption technology like DES, but can operate
  at very high speeds" said the source. Seneca's original specifications
  included a throughput of 2Mbps, but testing had achieved rates of
  20Mbps.

Isn't part of the security with DES its slowness, which implies that this
new encryption method will be inherently risky because of its speed ?

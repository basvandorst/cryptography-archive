Yes, but the part that bothered me the most was the paragraph
after this one, which was the last paragraph in the article.  It
said that this person (who I believe was the president of Mykotronx(sp?))
would be more upset if such a search had been done by a government agency
in an unauthorized manner.  There is no explanation of what he was referring
to in this last statement (since it could be either the searching of a 
dumpster by some unknown person, or a legally authorized search by a federal
agency).  Since this is the main point of the opponents of this chip, I
think this point needed more clarification.  Overall, though, I thought that
the article was done well, and hopefully with enough digging through DNS
information, someone will figure out how to ask that it be posted here.

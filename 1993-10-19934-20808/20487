Several years ago Intel manufactured a device called a Keyprom which was an
EPROM with hardware protection built in.  All my databooks are at home so I
can't look it up (and I'm pretty sure that it's been discontinued now anyway),
but that did provide security for EPROM's.  Maybe someone with the relevant
databooks handy could post a quick summary.

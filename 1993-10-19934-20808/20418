Any system that could be quickly done by hand will be easily crackable
by computer.  If you can perform the algorithm by hand in a reasonable
amount of time, then a brute-force search will be easy on a computer.

If you want to cheat and say that you can carry around one page of key
material for each page of text you would want to send, (which is
usually impractical) then here's a system.

Pick a DES key, encrypt 2K of nulls with it using CFB mode, and print
out the ciphertext, triple-spaced in hexadecimal.  Then, when you want
to send your message, write it out in hexadecimal on the first blank
line of the printout, and XOR it into the second blank line.  Send the
result; someone with the DES key can read it using OFB mode.  Happy
now?  You have to destroy the printouts if you're captured, of course.

Try reading any good book on the history of cryptography; David Kahn's
"The Codebreakers" is out of print but it should be available in your
university library; this kind of stuff is certainly interesting
(especially if you want to write WWII spy novels) but no longer
practical for real-world purposes.

So nobody gives it much thought, any more than people worry about the
problem of horse dung piling up on the interstate.

At the moment there is only one bug I'm aware of.
When you are using the VT320 compilation switch, 
the title screen isn't displayed. This does also
aply for the pure vt100 graphics with the VT 
switch, but not for SWEARWORDS (System V curses)
or the ANSI colour graphics under DOS. I haven't
tested BSDCURSES yet.

This is not such a kind of a problem, because 
this is contains no vital information. At the 
moment I don't know how to fix it. So when you see
a black screen, just press <Return>.

NAME
     newalias - install new elm aliases for user and/or system

SYNOPSIS
     newalias [-g]

DESCRIPTION
     _N_e_w_a_l_i_a_s creates new hash and data files from a  text  file.
     If  the  program  is  invoked with the -_g (global) flag, the
     program updates the system alias files.  Otherwise, the pro-
     gram  looks  for  a file called $_H_O_M_E/._e_l_m/_a_l_i_a_s_e_s._t_e_x_t and,
     upon  finding  it,  creates  files   $_H_O_M_E/._e_l_m/_a_l_i_a_s_e_s._d_i_r,
     $_H_O_M_E/._e_l_m/_a_l_i_a_s_e_s._p_a_g  and  $_H_O_M_E/._e_l_m/_a_l_i_a_s_e_s  for the _e_l_m
     program.

     The format that the program expects is;

          alias, alias, .. = comment = address
     or
          alias, alias, .. = comment = alias, alias, ...

     The first form is for an individual user such as;

          dave, taylor = Dave Taylor = veeger!hpcnou!dat

     or optionally as;

          dave, taylor = Taylor; Dave = veeger!hpcnou!dat

     to allow the aliases to be properly sorted by last name.

     The second is for defining a group alias such as;

          gurus = Unix Gurus = alan, john, dave, mike, richard,
                            larry, t_richardson


     Note that lines can be continued at will,  blank  lines  are
     accepted  without error, and that any line starting with '#'
     is considered a comment and is not processed.

     If the `comment', or `address' fields need  to  contain  `='
     characters,  those characters must either be escaped using a
     backslash character or the address must  be  inside  double-
     quotes (`"').

     Aliases are case insensitive so dave and Dave are  both  the
     same alias.

     Finally, aliases can contain other aliases, and/or groups;

          unix = Unix people = gurus, taylor, jonboy

DIAGNOSTICS
     Newalias has a couple of descriptive  error  messages  which
     don't  need to be detailed here.  It is, however, worth not-
     ing that the _c_h_e_c_k_a_l_i_a_s program can be used to  ensure  that
     the  aliases  are  in the proper order and are available for
     the _e_l_m system.

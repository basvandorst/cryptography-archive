NAME
     printmail - format mail in a readable fashion for printing

SYNOPSIS
     printmail {-p} {filename}

DESCRIPTION
     _P_r_i_n_t_m_a_i_l copies all messages from either the file specified
     or the default user mailbox with each message separated by a
     line of dashes.   With  the  -p  option,  the  messages  are
     separated by a form feed instead.

     In fact, this command  is  actually  just  a  slightly  dif-
     ferently formatted call to _r_e_a_d_m_s_g:
          readmsg {-p} {-f _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e} *
     which does all the work here.

EXAMPLE
     A typical usage of this command is;

          printmail | lpr

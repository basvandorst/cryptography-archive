NAME
     checkalias - check to see if an alias is defined.

SYNOPSIS
     checkalias alias, alias, ...

DESCRIPTION
     _C_h_e_c_k_a_l_i_a_s checks the user file first, and then  the  system
     alias  file  to  try to find the specified alias or aliases.
     If found, the value of the alias is printed  out,  otherwise
     an  error  is  generated.   Note: this is in fact a one-line
     shell script;

          elm -c $*

BUGS
     Note that the precedence of aliases is user file then system
     file.   This  means  that  a user can 'overload' an alias by
     having one defined  in  the  system  file  also  defined  in
     theirs.   This  shouldn't  turn  out to be a problem, but is
     something for the system administrator to keep in mind  when
     creating the system alias file.

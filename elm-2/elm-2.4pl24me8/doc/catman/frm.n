NAME
     frm,nfrm - list from and subject  of  selected  messages  in
     mailbox or folder

SYNOPSIS
     frm [-hnQqStv] [-s _s_t_a_t_u_s] [folder | username] ...
     nfrm [-hnQqStv] [-s _s_t_a_t_u_s] [folder | username] ...

DESCRIPTION
     _F_r_m outputs one line per message of the form:

     _f_r_o_m [_s_u_b_j_e_c_t]

     where _f_r_o_m is the name of the person the  message  is  from,
     and  _s_u_b_j_e_c_t  is the subject of the message, if present.  If
     the message is from you, the _f_r_o_m  portion  will  read  ``To
     user'',  where  `user'  is the user the message was sent to.
     This happens when you receive a copy of a letter you sent.

     If a folder is specified,  the  program  reads  that  folder
     rather than the default mailbox.  If the argument is a user-
     name then _f_r_m looks in that  user's  mailbox,  provided  you
     have permission to read it.

     A folder can be specified with the  same  notation  as  when
     invoking the Elm mailer (e.g., =folder).

     _F_r_m invoked as _n_f_r_m is identical to invoking ``frm -s new''.

OPTIONS
     The _f_r_m program has the following options:

     -h   Print a brief help message summarizing the options.

     -n   Number the messages using  the  same  numbering  scheme
          that, for example, _r_e_a_d_m_s_g will understand.

     -Q   Very quiet mode.  Only  error  messages  are  produced.
          This  option is useful in shell scripts, where only the
          success or failure of the  program  is  important,  and
          output is not desired.

     -q   Quiet mode.  Output only a one-line  summary  for  each
          mailbox or folder specified.

     -S   Summarize the number of messages by message  status  in
          each  mailbox  or  folder.   If you want just a summary
          line, use this in conjunction with the -q option.

     -s _s_t_a_t_u_s
          Only display  headers  from  messages  with  the  given
          status.   `status'  is  one  of  "new", "unread", "old"

          (same as "unread"), or "read".  The -s  option  can  be
          specified  multiple  times  to print header information
          from, for example, only new and unread messages.  It is
          sufficient  to  specify  only  the  first letter of the
          status.

     -t   Tidy mode. If the _f_r_o_m field is long enough to displace
          the  subject  field from its natural start column, move
          the subject down onto the next line.

     -v   Verbose mode.  Print a descriptive header before  list-
          ing the contents of each mailbox or folder.

EXIT STATUS
     _F_r_m returns a zero  status  ("true")  if  messages  matching
     `status' are present.  _F_r_m returns 1 if no messages matching
     `status' are present, but there are some messages, returns 2
     if  there  are  no messages at all, or returns 3 if an error
     occurred.  If multiple mailboxes or folders  are  specified,
     the exit status only applies to the last one examined.  This
     can be used in scripts to determine what kind of mail a user
     has.

EXAMPLES
     Some example uses:

          $ frm

     will display header information from  all  the  messages  in
     your  mailbox, or ``You have no mail.'' if there are no mes-
     sages in your incoming mailbox.

          $ frm -s new

     will display header information from  all  new  messages  in
     your  mailbox,  or  ``You  have  no  new  mail.''   Note the
     slightly different diagnostic.

          $ frm -s new -s unread guest

     assuming you  have  the  proper  file  permissions  to  read
     guest's mail, will print out header information from all new
     and unread messages in guest's incoming mailbox.   If  there
     are no messages, _f_r_m will print ``guest has no mail.''

          $ frm -q -S

     will print only a one line summary of how many read, unread,
     and  read  messages are in your incoming mailbox.  For exam-
     ple, ``You have 2 new messages, 3 unread messages,  23  read
     messages.''

NAME
     elm - an interactive mail system

SYNOPSIS
     elm [ -achkKmrtwz ] [ -f _a_l_t_e_r_n_a_t_e-_f_o_l_d_e_r ] [ -d _d_e_b_u_g-_l_e_v_e_l
     ]
     elm [ -s _s_u_b_j_e_c_t ] _l_i_s_t _o_f _a_l_i_a_s_e_s _o_r _a_d_d_r_e_s_s_e_s

DESCRIPTION
     _E_l_m is an interactive screen-oriented  mailer  program  that
     supersedes _m_a_i_l and _m_a_i_l_x.

     There are three main ways to use the elm mailer.  One way to
     use the mailer is to specify a list of addresses on the com-
     mand line when the mailer is invoked.  This will allow send-
     ing of a single message to the specified recipients with all
     the options usually available in the elm system itself.  For
     example, the command

          elm -s testing joe

     would initiate the sending of a message  to  the  alias  joe
     with  the subject "testing" indicated and would put you into
     an editor for you to enter the text of the message.  If  the
     subject  flag  and  argument  were not present, you would be
     prompted for a message subject.

     The second way, used most commonly when  transmitting  files
     and  such,  is to specify the subject of the message and the
     recipients using the command line and  redirect  a  file  as
     standard input.  For example, the command

          elm -s testing joe < test.c

     would mail a copy of the file test.c to alias joe, with  the
     subject  "testing" indicated.  The subject flag and argument
     are optional.

     The third way, elm  is  invoked  with  neither  subject  nor
     addresses specified on the command line and without standard
     input redirected.  You can then read any  messages  in  your
     incoming mailbox (or specified folder), reply to messages in
     the mailbox, mail messages, etc.

     Options are:

       -a      Arrow - force the arrow  cursor  (instead  of  the
               inverse bar)

       -c      Checkalias -  expand  the  following  aliases  and
               return.

NAME
     listalias - list user and system aliases

SYNOPSIS
     listalias [ -s | -u ] [ regular-expression ]

DESCRIPTION
     _L_i_s_t_a_l_i_a_s outputs a line per alias in both the user and  the
     system aliases.  Each line is of the form;

        <alias>     <address>  (<comment>)

     If an optional regular expression is used, just the  aliases
     that  match  the  specified  expression are listed.  If not,
     they are all listed.

     Either way, the output is sorted.

OPTIONS
     -s   Display only the system aliases.  -s and -u  are  mutu-
          ally exclusive.

     -u   Display only the user aliases.  -s and -u are  mutually
          exclusive.

BUGS
     Since the program uses a pipe to egrep, how expressions  are
     evaluated is a function of _t_h_a_t program, not this one!

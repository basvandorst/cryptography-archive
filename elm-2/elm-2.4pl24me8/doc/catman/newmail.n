NAME
     newmail,wnewmail - programs to asynchronously notify of  new
     mail

SYNOPSIS
     newmail [-d] [-i _i_n_t_e_r_v_a_l] [-w] _f_i_l_e-_s_p_e_c {_f_i_l_e-_s_p_e_c...}
     wnewmail [-d] [-i _i_n_t_e_r_v_a_l] [-w] _f_i_l_e-_s_p_e_c {_f_i_l_e-_s_p_e_c...}

DESCRIPTION
     _N_e_w_m_a_i_l is a program to allow monitoring of mailboxes in  an
     intelligent fashion.  It is based loosely on _b_i_f_f(_1) and the
     version of _n_e_w_m_a_i_l that was distributed with Elm  1.7.   The
     basic  operation  is that the program will check the list of
     specified mailboxes each _i_n_t_e_r_v_a_l seconds and will list  any
     new  mail that has arrived in any of the mailboxes, indicat-
     ing the sender name, and the subject of the  message.   Each
     entry  displayed  can  be  in  a number of different formats
     depending on the mode of the program, the number of  folders
     being  monitored,  and the status of the message.  If you're
     running it as a _w_i_n_d_o_w (e.g. ``-w'' or invoked as  _w_n_e_w_m_a_i_l)
     then the output will be similar to:

        _s_e_n_d_e_r _n_a_m_e - _s_u_b_j_e_c_t _o_f _m_e_s_s_a_g_e
        Priority: _s_e_n_d_e_r _n_a_m_e - _s_u_b_j_e_c_t _o_f _m_e_s_s_a_g_e

     where <sender name> is either the name of the person sending
     it, if available (the ARPA 'From:' line) or some other brief
     indication of origin.   If you are the sender, <sender name>
     will  be  replaced by "to <recipient name>".  If there is no
     subject, the message  "<no  subject>"  will  appear  on  the
     screen.   Folders  are  indicated  by having the folder name
     appear first on the output line, as in:

        _f_o_l_d_e_r: _s_e_n_d_e_r _n_a_m_e - _s_u_b_j_e_c_t _o_f _m_e_s_s_a_g_e

     If you're running _n_e_w_m_a_i_l without the windows  option,  then
     the  output  is more suitable for popping up on an otherwise
     active screen, and will be formatted:

        >> New mail from _s_e_n_d_e_r _n_a_m_e - _s_u_b_j_e_c_t _o_f _m_e_s_s_a_g_e
        >> Priority mail from _s_e_n_d_e_r _n_a_m_e - _s_u_b_j_e_c_t _o_f _m_e_s_s_a_g_e

     Again, with folder names indicated as a prefix.   The  flags
     available are:

     -d        This will turn on the  debugging,  verbose  output
               mode.   It  is  not  recommended that you use this
               option unless you're interested in actually debug-
               ging the program.

     -i _i_n_t_e_r_v_a_l
               This will change the frequency  that  the  program

               checks  the  folders to the interval specified, in
               seconds.  The default interval for the program  is
               60  seconds.   _N_o_t_e: _i_f _y_o_u _c_h_a_n_g_e _t_h_e _i_n_t_e_r_v_a_l _t_o
               _l_e_s_s _t_h_a_n _1_0 _s_e_c_o_n_d_s, _t_h_e _p_r_o_g_r_a_m  _w_i_l_l  _w_a_r_n  _y_o_u

     -w        Use of the ``-w'' flag will  simulate  having  the
               program  run  from  within a window (e.g. the more
               succinct output format, and so on).  Most  likely,
               rather than using this option you should be simply
               invoking _w_n_e_w_m_a_i_l instead.  _F_i_l_e _s_p_e_c_s are made up
               of  two components, the _f_o_l_d_e_r _n_a_m_e and the _p_r_e_f_i_x
               _s_t_r_i_n_g, the latter of which can always be omitted.
               The format is _f_o_l_d_e_r_n_a_m_e=_p_r_e_f_i_x_s_t_r_i_n_g, and you can
               specify folders by full name, by simply  the  name
               of  the user whose mailbox should be monitored, or
               by the standard Elm metacharacters to specify your
               folder  directory  (e.g.  ``+'', ``='', or ``%'').
               Folders that cannot be opened  due  to  permission
               mismatches  will  cause the program to immediately
               abort.  On the other hand, files that do not exist
               will   continue   to  be  checked  every  _i_n_t_e_r_v_a_l
               seconds, so some care  should  be  exercised  when
               invoking  the program.  The program will run until
               you log out or explicitly kill it, and can  inter-
               nally reset itself if any of the folders shrink in
               size and then grow again.  The default  folder  to
               monitor is always your incoming mailbox.

EXAMPLES
     Some example invocations:

          $ newmail

     will check your incoming mailbox every 60 seconds.

          $ newmail  -i  15  joe  root

     will  monitor  the  incoming  mailboxes  for   ``joe''   and
     ``root'', checking every 15 seconds for new mail.

          $ newmail  "mary=Mary"  +postmaster=POBOX

     will monitor the incoming mailbox for user ``mary'', prefix-
     ing all messages with the string ``Mary'', and the folder in
     the users _m_a_i_l_d_i_r directory called ``postmaster'', prefixing
     all  of  those  messages  with ``POBOX''.  You can also have
     more complex monitoring too, for example:

          $ newmail  -i  30  $LOGNAME=me  ${LOGNAME}su=myroot   /tmp/mbox

     will check every 30 seconds for the users mailbox, a mailbox

     that  is  the  users  login-name  with ``su'' appended (e.g.
     ``joe'' would become ``joesu'') and the file /tmp/mbox, pre-
     fixing  new  mail  for  each  with  ``me'',  ``myroot''  and
     ``mbox'' respectively.

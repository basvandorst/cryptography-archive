This is a fix of a very dumb error which mpd@netcom.com found.
pgp_randombyte uses the time as part of the randomness, but I forgot
to initialize the variable. This did not compromise security too bad,
because the time is already factored in when it initializes, but
it needed fixing, so here's the fix.

Coming soon: Diffie-Hellman exchange.

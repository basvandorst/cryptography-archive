This code seems to work on a big-endian machine, but I'm not sure. This
version has most of the set-precision's taken out, since mpilib does that
automatically for the modexp's.

The program also needs a better makefile.

This version fixes a bug in fifo_moven which would hang up if n was larger
than the number of bytes left in the fifo. The mp_inv in pgpkgen.c is much
faster than the old one, and was provided by an anonymous contributor.

This is PGP 2.6.3ia for BeOS. Changes have been as minimal as possible,
for the most part the BeOS POSIX compatibility layer takes care of
everything. However, /dev/tty does not work the same in BeOS as it
does on UNIX (it's unfortunate that it is even named the same), so
a small kludge had to be made in system.c.

Bugs in the port are the responsibility of Osma Ahvenlampi <oa@iki.fi>.
Feel free to contact if you have any questions about this BeOS port.

If you wish to recompile PGP yourself, download the pgp263is.tar.gz
package (version 2.6.3ia, 4 Mar 96) from www.ifi.uio.no, apply the
changes from pgp.diff to the source, and do a 'make beos'.

Don't forget the International PGP Home Page <http://www.ifi.uio.no/pgp/>!

Below is the MD5 checksum for the PGP binary. Don't forget that
/bin/md5sum in BeOS DR8.2 is broken, and will give invalid checksums.

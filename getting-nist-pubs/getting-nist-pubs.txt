Another way is to ftp it from our archive, HOWEVER WAIT FOR SEVERAL DAYS!
We just had the internal disk go bad and we're still waiting for that
"overnight" delivery to arrive!  But, by Wednesday or Thursday, Jan 14,
ftp to csrc.ncsl.nist.gov (129.6.54.11), user anonymous, and cd to 
pub/nistpubs, and get 800-2.txt.  Sorry, no .ps available.  I'll second
the recommendation for this text - it is a very good introduction to
cryptography and has enough math to really get you started.  And, it's
free!

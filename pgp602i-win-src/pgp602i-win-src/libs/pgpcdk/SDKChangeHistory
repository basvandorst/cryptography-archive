- added checking to pgpBase.h to verify that one of {PGP_UNIX, PGP_MACINTOSH,
  PGP_WIN32} is defined.

- added support for Diffie-Helman only version.  This includes changing key
  properties to indicate that RSA keys can't sign and can't encrypt.

- added include file "pgpSDKBuildFlags.h" which contains all our build flags.

- Mac libaries and PEF names are changed.

- illegal options are now errors.  A kPGPError_BadParams will be returned if
  you pass an illegal option.  In the debug version, the option number will be
  displayed in a debug message.

- Put self-signatures onto secret keyring in addition to public keyring.

- Rename PGPOKeyGenPreferredAlgorithms to PGPOPreferredAlgorithms.
  Add support for it on encryption.

- all CipherFeedback functions and data types have been renamed to use the
  term "CFB".

- PGPNewSymmetricCipher, PGPNewCipherFeedback, PGPNewHash were renamed to
  PGPNewSymmetricCipherContext, PGPNewCipherFeedbackContext, PGPNewHashContext. 
  
 - PGPGetNumMessageRecoveryKeys has been renamed to PGPCountMessageRecoveryKeys

- Remove keyset parameter from PGPGetIndexedMessageRecoveryKeyID and
  PGPCountMessageRecoveryKeys

- Add pgpPublicKey.h and pgpCBC.h, along with the new data types for these,
  and the source modules to support them.

- Add support for PKCS1 formatting of bignums as used in SSL in addition to
  standard PGP formating.

- kPGPError_ItemIsReadOnly is now returned upon any attempt to modify a key
  or keyDB which is not mutable.  Previously, the behavior was somewhat
  inconsistent, sometimes returning kPGPError_FileLocked, sometimes failing
  silently, and sometimes making the change anyway even though it cannot be
  committed.

- MacBinary code now uses external file to perform Mac creator/type to
  DOS file name extension mapping (and vice versa).  The file is created
  if it does not exist, but once it exists, it is the only information
  used to perform these mappings.

- Fix two bugs: (1) secret keys which aren't axiomatic weren't having their
  non-exportable signatures trusted; (2) expired keys were returned as having
  no validity, but only once the first maintenance pass was run after the
  time of expiring.

- Changed definitions of following functions to standardize on void */PGPSize
  as descriptors of a buffer in memory. These functions were previously using
  PGPByte * and/or PGPUInt32:
  
		PGPInitCBC
		PGPCBCEncrypt
		PGPCBCDecrypt
		PGPInitCFB
		PGPCFBEncrypt
		PGPCFBDecrypt
		PGPCFBGetRandom
		PGPCFBRandomCycle
		PGPCFBRandomWash
		PGPContinueHash
		PGPFinalizeHash
		PGPNewKeyFingerPrintFilter
		PGPGetKeyPropertyBuffer
		PGPGetSubKeyPropertyBuffer
		PGPImportKeyID
		PGPPublicKeyEncrypt
		PGPPublicKeyVerifySignature
		PGPPrivateKeyDecrypt
		PGPPrivateKeySign
		PGPInitSymmetricCipher
		PGPWashSymmetricCipher
		PGPSymmetricCipherEncrypt
		PGPSymmetricCipherDecrypt
		PGPContextGetRandomBytes
		PGPGetHashSize

- Add support for revocationkey subpacket, to allow keys to be revoked by
  other keys, as well as for the nonrevokable attribute so that keys can't
  revoke their revocationkey subpacket.

- Change name of additional decryption packet to reflect its true nature.

Instructions for installing the PGPmemlock memory locking driver - 
Windows NT version


1. Copy the driver PGPmemlock.sys to the <nt_root>\system32\drivers\ 
   directory, i.e.:

   copy PGPmemlock.sys c:\winnt\system32\drivers\


2. Update the registry by *EITHER*  

   a) running regini.exe on the PGPmemlock.ini file, i.e.:

           regini PGPmemlock.ini

   *OR*

   b) editing the registry manually with REGEDIT.  You should create
      a registry key called 
	  \HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\PGPmemlock

      in this location, create the following registry entries with the 
      following types and values :

      entry			type		value
      ErrorControl	REG_DWORD 	0x00000001
      Type			REG_DWORD 	0x00000001
      Start			REG_DWORD	0x00000002
	  DisplayName	REG_SZ		"PGP secure memory driver"


3. Reboot the computer.  This will cause the driver to load automatically.  


4. Note:  If you do not want the driver to load automatically everytime 
   the computer boots, you can control the loading and unloading of the 
   driver manually.  To do this, run the "Devices" applet in the Control 
   Panel.  Select the PGPmemlock driver and press the "Startup" button.
   The valid choices for the PGPmemlock driver are "Automatic" (driver
   automatically runs on startup (default)) and "Manual".  If you select 
   "Manual", you must start and stop the driver manually with the "Start"
   and "Stop" buttons in the "Devices" applet.


Instructions for uninstalling the driver :

1. Run the "Devices" applet in the control panel.  Select the PGPmemlock
   driver.  Click on "Stop".

2. Delete PGPmemlock.sys from the <nt_root>\system32\drivers\ directory.

3. Delete the 
   \HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\PGPmemlock 
   key and all its entries.

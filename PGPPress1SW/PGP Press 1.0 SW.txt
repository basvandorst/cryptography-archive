Usage of PGP Press: (Quick summary)

* The Memo (RichEdit) field of the Main Form MUST contain the partial string @SERIAL@.
  [Case sensitive and ONLY in one place]

* Everything in the Press Run window explains itself quite well. Just type in the PGP-key's 
  ID, and the Pass Phrase. (The latter won't show on screen).
  
  Pick which unique serial-number you wish to start and end with.
  
  Optionally change the name of the output files (Must include @SERIAL@ variable as well, 
  same rules as above apply)

  Find the directories of PGP.EXE (checkbox will check when verified) and the output path.

  Push the button, and you should have yourself up to <Signed Longint range> PGP Pressed 
  files.

  The program will automatically use the PGPPATH DOS environment variable (not case-sensitive) 
  to find the PGP.EXE file.

  Last but not least, this is a '1.0' product. It lacks some desired functions, but they wrae 
  to hard to implement within a short time. An example is that the output path can not be longer 
  than approx. 35 chars.

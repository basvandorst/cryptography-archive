WPCRACK recovers the password from a password protected Word Perfect file.

Usage:  WPCRACK <protected file> [<most common character>]

   The most common character in the original (unprotected) file may be entered
   as a decimal value.  It defaults to 0.  If 0 doesn't work, try 32 (ASCII
   space).

Example: WPCRACK C:\WP51\CIPHERED

This version of WPCRACK will also work with WP 4.x files. Only source is
included, as I run it on Linux, and don't have a compiler for DOS.

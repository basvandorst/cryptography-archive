                           PGPMENU v. 3.0

Free!  Now making it easy to use the signature features of PGP to clear sign
text, make detached signatures, etc.  Also supports the new "Comment" 
feature.  Works with all known versions of PGP (2.6, 2.6ui, 2.61, 2.6.2, 2.7).

PGPMENU is an ASCII text graphic menu system to perform the functions of 
encrypting, decrypting, key management and digital signatures.  You can call 
your text editor from the Main Menu (See section on the configuration file).  
Custom design your own color configuration.  
 

                             INSTALLATION

PM.EXE looks for PMCOLOR.CFG in the same directory.  The easiest installation 
is to copy all files to your PGP directory.

                          THE CONFIGURATION FILE

The configuration files allow you to access your text editor from the Main
Menu by specifying its path and command.  You can also compose your own 
configuration file using your text editor in ASCII text mode.  It is important 
that the configuration files have line lengths of 80 characters and white 
spaces until the last color configuration selection on line 54.  Any 
additional personal information should be appended after that.  You can append 
your public key file and distribute your configuration with your public key, 
which PGP will read automatically without editing the file.

I. Selecting Colors
  
      PMCOLOR.CFG: The default, which is also PMWILD.CFG
      PMB&W.CFG: Black and White 
      PMCYAN.CFG: Cyan, Blue and Green
      PMBLINK.CFG: Illustrates the blinking phenomenon
      PMRW&B.CFG: Red, White and Blue
      PMWILD.CFG: Red, Green, Cyan, Magenta on Black	

PM.EXE looks for PMCOLOR.CFG to configure PGPMENU to your color selections.  
Change the default configuration file name to PGPRW&B.CFG (red, white & 
blue) and change another configuration file name to PMCOLOR.CFG. 

The color choices for the Key Management Menu will apply to the Plaintext 
Signature Menu.  The choices for the Main Menu may be unique.  

The COLOR CODE is presented in each CFG file for easy reference, and is in 
the form presented here:

          00=Black                 08=Dark Grey
          01=Blue                  09=Bright Blue
          02=Green                 10=Bright Green           
          03=Cyan                  11=Bright Cyan
          04=Red                   12=Bright Red
          05=Magenta               13=Bright Magenta
          06=Brown                 14=Yellow
          07=White                 15=Bright White

Text Colors, Text Highlight Colors, and Border Colors can be any choices, 
but background colors must be 00 through 07.  Choosing background colors 
higher than 07 will automatically select the color number less 8 (Yellow 
14 becomes Brown 06, Bright Blue 09 becomes Blue 01).  In addition, the
foreground text may blink, depending upon your environment, TSR's, etc.  
This can be advantageous.  PMBLINK.CFG illustrates the blinking phenomenon 
where the highlight background color is greater than 07 and matches the 
window color, invisibly causing the highlighted text to blink.  In the 
configuration files the choices where one is limited to 00 through 007 are 
marked with the notation: (! > 07)

II. Selecting the Text Editor

The choice of Text Editor is made on line 10.  Use your regular DOS command 
to call your text editor, including path if necessary.  Do not enter any 
other characters on this line to avoid the additional characters being 
included in the command.  If you leave this line blank the text editor feature will be
disabled.
 
You can use the access to your text editor to make the color changes, but 
remember that you must first quit PGPMENU to make the color changes take 
effect.

<P>Preface</P>
<P>In January of 1993 the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
initiated the preparation of this and other publications on various aspects of
the civilian cryptography issue.  The purpose of this project was to prepare
concise summaries of information, based upon research in open source literature,
on a particular topic of interest relevant to the public discussion of
cryptographic-related issues.</P>

and codes of the foreign countries. This search yielded limited and incomplete
information which had to be supplemented by other resources. The researchers
collected information from various embassies, with limited success, and also
referred to various secondary sources such as reports prepared for the National
Institute of Standards and Technology for conferences addressing encryption
issues. The authors of reports were called and queried as to the strength and
validity of the information presented in the reports. This process proved to be
rather helpful. During the analysis of the reports, it was found that others
have attempted this type of research before and have had similar limited

<H2>1.  INTRODUCTION</H2>
<P>This document analyzes foreign controls pertaining to encryption technology.
Controls surveyed include export and import laws and any domestic laws that
could be found. Research for this task began with a search of actual statutes
and codes of the foreign countries. This search yielded limited and incomplete
information which had to be supplemented by other resources. The researchers
collected information from various embassies, with limited success, and also
referred to various secondary sources such as reports prepared for the National
Institute of Standards and Technology for conferences addressing encryption
issues. The authors of reports were called and queried as to the strength and
validity of the information presented in the reports. This process proved to be
rather helpful. During the analysis of the reports, it was found that others
have attempted this type of research before and have had similar limited
success, with one manufacturer finally having its subsidiaries ask foreign
government officials what their policies were.</P>
<P>Twenty-one countries were researched by the aforementioned method.
Information was found for most of the countries. A few countries had no official
controls, although actual controls may in fact be exercised.</P>
<H2>2.  ENCRYPTION TECHNOLOGY FOREIGN LAWS</H2>
<P><B>2.1  AUSTRALIA&#151;IMPORT CONTROLS ON ENCRYPTION TECHNOLOGY</B></P>
<P>Australia requires an import certificate for encryption software or hardware
only upon request by the exporting country.&lt;1&gt;</P>
<P><B>2.2  BELGIUM&#151;IMPORT CONTROLS ON ENCRYPTION TECHNOLOGY</B></P>
<P>Belgium does not impose import restrictions for encryption technology.&lt;2&gt;</P>
<P><B>2.3  BRAZIL&#151;IMPORT CONTROLS ON ENCRYPTION TECHNOLOGY</B></P>
<P>Brazil does not impose import restrictions for encryption technology.&lt;3&gt;</P>
<H1>2.4  CANADA</H1>
<H1>2.4.1  Export and Import Permits Act</H1>
<P>The Export and Import Permits Act (EIPA) regulates the export and import of
goods in Canada. To ensure compliance with the provisions of EIPA, customs
officers are authorized to satisfy themselves that all pertinent requirements
have been met.&lt;4&gt; The provisions of the Customs Act pertaining to search,
detention, seizure, forfeiture, and condemnation apply where any provisions of
the EIPA or regulations have been violated.&lt;5&gt; Violators are subject to
criminal prosecution.&lt;6&gt;</P>
<H1>2.4.2  Import Controls</H1>
<P>Based on the listed items in the Import Control List, the importation of
cryptographic technology into Canada is not controlled.&lt;7&gt;</P>
<H1>2.4.3  Export Controls</H1>
<P>The exportation of items from Canada may be subject to restriction if they
are included on the Export Control List&lt;8&gt; pursuant to the EIPA. Canada
follows the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM)
regulations in the regulation of cryptographic technology. Encryption devices
are outlined in category five, part two of Canada's export regulations. These
provisions are similar to U.S. category five in the Export Administration
Regulations.&lt;9&gt;</P>
<H1>2.5  PEOPLES REPUBLIC OF CHINA</H1>
<H1>2.5.1  Import Controls</H1>
<P>China practices a licensing scheme for imported commodities. An application
is to be filed and a license obtained in advance by corporations approved by the
state to engage in the business of importing commodities. A license is valid for
1 year, and a corporation may apply for an extension.</P>
<P>Based on China's List of Prohibited and Restricted Imports and Exports
enacted in 1987, China restricts the importation of voice-encoding devices.&lt;10&gt;</P>
<H1>2.5.2  Export Controls</H1>
<P>A corporation engaging in the exportation business must first file an
application for approval with the Ministry of Foreign Trade or the foreign trade
bureau of the province.&lt;11&gt; The Ministry establishes an export control
list of prohibited and restricted goods.</P>
<P>Based on China's List of Prohibited and Restricted Imports and Exports,
China restricts the exportation of voice-encoding devices.&lt;12&gt;</P>
<H1>2.6  EUROPEAN COMMUNITY</H1>
<P>In 1957, the Treaty of Rome&lt;13&gt; established the European Economic
Community (EC). The EC members are the territories of Belgium, Denmark, the
Federal Republic of Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Great Britain, Greece, Spain, and Portugal. In 1986, the Single
European Act&lt;14&gt; modified the treaties, creating the European Communities
so as to establish an internal market without boundaries in which free
dissemination of merchandise, persons, services, and capital are assured. The
free internal market would be continually implemented by the member-states
during the course of a 5-year period concluding on December 31, 1992.</P>
<H1>2.6.1  Import Controls</H1>
<P>Most articles imported from EC member-states are not subject to
restrictions. The rules applicable to the free movement of goods are derived
from Articles 9 et seq. of the Treaty of Rome. However, Article 36 allows
prohibitions of restrictions on imports justified for various reasons, such as
public morality, public policy, or public security. The EC courts have
consistently held that Article 36 is applicable to measures of a noneconomic
nature, such as the maintenance of a national health care system or the security
of member-state oil supplies.&lt;15&gt;</P>
<P>No import/export controls on encryption technology were found.</P>
<H1>2.6.2  Export Controls</H1>
<P>Most products exported to EC member-states are not subject to restrictions;
however, certain sensitive products and technologies deemed necessary for
national policy are subject to the laws and regulations instituted by
member-states.&lt;16&gt; The sensitive nature of certain products derives from
the dual use&#151;civil and military&#151;which can be made of them. Intra-EC
member trade is to be regulated by controls pursuant to the COCOM rules;
however, a satisfactory basis for cooperation between member-states and the
Commission has not been established. The objective will be to develop uniform
export and import control lists of products and their respective destinations.&lt;17&gt;
The developing momentum of the intergovernmental conference on political union
in regard to exports of weapons and nonproliferation should facilitate an
agreement on the treatment of dual-use products.&lt;18&gt;</P>
<P>No import/export controls on encryption technology were found.</P>
<P>Currently, the Commission of the European Communities is developing a
European telecommunications policy to establish a common telecommunications
market (networks and telecommunications equipment).&lt;19&gt; The emerging
telecommunication policy is governed by the Treaty of Rome and by the
fundamental human rights as developed by the European Court of Justice.&lt;20&gt;
This telecommunications policy might affect the future controls on cryptographic
technology in voice and data networks.</P>
<H1>2.7  FRANCE</H1>
<H1>2.7.1  Import Controls</H1>
<P>Imports into France are governed by French law and the EC regulations.&lt;21&gt;
Two considerations must be considered in connection to entry of goods into
France: whether goods to be imported into France are subject to any import
restrictions and what declarations or filings are to be made for permissible
importation. Goods can fall into four categories: articles not subject to
restrictions, articles subject to prior notification, articles subject to an
import license, or articles subject to special import restrictions.&lt;22&gt;</P>
<P>Almost all goods that originate in the EC as well as certain goods specified
by law may be imported into France without being subject to import restrictions.
An import license is valid for only 6 months and only with reference to a
specific type of merchandise coming from a specific origin.&lt;23&gt;</P>
<P>France requires a license for the import of encryption into the country.&lt;24&gt;
France requires Data Encryption Standard&#150;based encryption manufacturers and
users to deposit a key with the French government, and they may also require an
import license if it is determined necessary on a case-by-case review. France
would probably forbid the use of key escrow technology unless they are given the
keys and a full description of the algorithm.&lt;25&gt;</P>
<H1>2.7.2  Export Controls</H1>
<P>Most products exported to EC member-states are not subject to restrictions;
however, certain products are subject to prior notification, an export license,
or a prior authorization before they may be exported. Such notifications,
licenses, or authorizations are obtained pursuant to similar procedures
governing importations.&lt;26&gt;</P>
<P>In order to preserve the interests of French national security or defense,
exports or use of cryptography must (1) be &quot;declared prior to the operation
when this operation only results in certification, or in the securization of the
transmitted message; and (2) be authorized prior to the operation by the Prime
Minister in any other cases.&quot;&lt;27&gt; The penalty for not complying is a
fine of 6,000 to 500,000 FF and/or a prison sentence from 3 to 8 months.&lt;28&gt;
</P>
<P>A declaration of delivery or use of means of cryptography is issued at the
central bureau for security of information systems. The request form for a
declaration has two parts, a technical part and an administrative part. The
technical part is an &quot;extensive description in French of the operation or
means of cryptography and of its exploitation mode, including the management of
secret arrangements.&quot;&lt;29&gt; The administrative part allows for the
identification of the person requesting the operation, location of the
operation, and the categories of persons or societies allowed to use the
operation.&lt;30&gt; The request indicates the duration for which the
authorization is requested, which cannot exceed 10 years.&lt;31&gt; The export
of cryptography requires the deposit of a copy of the receipt of the declaration
to the customs office.</P>
<P>As in the United States, France has decontrolled software that is in the
public domain, and it retains control of mass-market and other encryption
software as military items. </P>
<H1>2.8  GERMANY</H1>
<H1>2.8.1  German Foreign Trade Act</H1>
<P>The German Foreign Trade Act of 1961 regulates German trade and recognizes
the need to reduce to a minimum restrictions and formalities in the import and
export of goods. Germany is considered one of the world's most liberal trading
nations.&lt;32&gt; However, Germany does provide for prohibitions and
restrictions for the protection of Germany's market organization, specific
industries, public health, and public order.&lt;33&gt; Germany draws a
distinction between trade regulations on the one hand and noncommercial
regulations on the other. Noncommercial regulation serves a purpose that is not
directly related to international trade, but rather to serving public health,
safety, industry, and public order.&lt;34&gt; Since Germany is a member of the
EC, the country's foreign trade policy has become increasingly influenced by EC
legislation.&lt;35&gt;</P>
<H1>2.8.2  Import Controls</H1>
<P>Germany has an import control list over 300 pages in length which in
combination with a list of countries indicates whether a license is required. A
license can be applied for at the Federal Office for Commercial Business.&lt;36&gt;</P>
<P>Germany does not have any restrictions on encryption products.&lt;37&gt;</P>
<H1>2.8.3  Export Controls</H1>
<P>The Foreign Trade Ordinance contains an export control list of all goods
subject to foreign trade restrictions. The export list does not impose
prohibitions, but it indicates authorization requirements. All goods requiring
authorization are classified by a four-digit code number. COCOM restrictions are
incorporated into the export list.</P>
<P>Germany has specifically exempted encryption software from the General
Software Note of the COCOM Industrial List.&lt;38&gt; Therefore, Germany
maintains control of both public domain and mass-market encryption software.</P>
<H1>2.9  INDIA</H1>
<P>No import/export controls were found.</P>
<H1>2.10  ISRAEL</H1>
<P>Israel imposes import restrictions on encryption; however, the scope of
their restrictions is not clear.&lt;39&gt;</P>
<H1>2.11  ITALY</H1>
<P>There are no import restrictions on encryption technology.&lt;40&gt; Italy
follows COCOM regulations for the export of encryption technology, allowing
public-domain and mass-market software to be exported with no license and other
encryption-capable items to be exported with a validated license.</P>
<H1>2.12  JAPAN</H1>
<H1>2.12.1  Import/Export Controls</H1>
<P>The Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Control Law governs the import and
export of goods in Japan. The Law is designed to permit the export of goods with
minimal restrictions.&lt;41&gt; The Law provides for some restrictions in order
to prevent unfair exportation and ensure orderly importation.&lt;42&gt; Unfair
exportation includes the export of goods that may infringe on an industrial
property right or copyright protected in the country of destination, export of
goods with false representation of country of origin, and goods that greatly
differ from the specifications given in the contract.&lt;43&gt;</P>
<P>The Law requires export licenses for certain kinds of goods and services for
certain destinations.&lt;44&gt; A person who intends to export goods and/or
technology to a destination designated in a cabinet order as an area where
international peace and security are obstructed is required to obtain a license
from the Minister of International Trade and Industry.&lt;45&gt; Primarily,
restrictions involve COCOM-controlled goods and technologies. Japan joined COCOM
in 1950 and enforces COCOM controls through a national list of strategic goods
and technology.&lt;46&gt; The list is published together with other controlled
items in a cabinet order and is administered by the Ministry of International
Trade and Industry.&lt;47&gt;</P>
<H1>2.12.2  Encryption Technology Controls</H1>
<P>Japan follows COCOM guidelines for the export of encryption technology.&lt;48&gt;
Generally, public-domain and mass-market software may be exported without a
validated license. Other encryption technologies are reviewed on a case-by-case
basis. No import controls were found. No domestic controls on encryption use
were found.</P>
<H1>2.13  SPAIN</H1>
<H1>2.13.1  Import/Export Controls</H1>
<P>The export of goods is regulated by Royal Decree No. 2426 of September 14,
1979. Royal Decree No. 2426 regulates the processing of export transactions,
payment of the purchase price, control, and the evaluation of trade balances.&lt;49&gt;
All goods may be exported, provided the conditions and requirements set forth by
the Decree have been met. There are no limitations other than those established
by the government for reasons of morality, health, public order, or other
internationally recognized reasons.&lt;50&gt; The export of goods is carried out
by allowing the granting of a license by the Minister of Economy and Finance.</P>
<H1>2.13.2  Encryption Technology Controls</H1>
<P>No import/export controls or domestic controls were found.</P>
<H1>2.14  THE NETHERLANDS</H1>
<H1>2.14.1  Import/Export Laws</H1>
<P>The Import and Export Act of 1963 controls the import and export of goods.

<H2>Verifying a public key over the phone</H2>
<P>If you get a public key from someone that is not certified by anyone
you trust, how can you tell if it's really their key?  The best way to
verify an uncertified key is to verify it over some independent
channel other than the one you received the key through.  One
convenient way to tell, if you know this person and would recognize
them on the phone, is to call them and verify their key over the
telephone.  Rather than reading their whole tiresome (ASCII-armored)
key to them over the phone, you can just read their key's
<I>fingerprint</I> to them.  To see this fingerprint, use the
<KBD>-kvc</KBD> command:
<PRE>
     pgp -kvc userid [keyring]
</PRE>
This will display the key with the 16-byte digest of the public key
components.  Read this 16-byte fingerprint to the key's owner on the
phone, while she checks it against her own, using the same <KBD>-kvc</KBD>
command at her end.  
<P>You can both verify each other's keys this way, and then you can sign
each other's keys with confidence.  This is a safe and convenient way
to get the key trust network started for your circle of friends.
<P>Note that sending a key fingerprint via E-mail is not the best way to
verify the key, because E-mail can be intercepted and modified.  It's
best to use a different channel than the one that was used to send
the key itself.  A good combination is to send the key via E-mail,
and the key fingerprint via a voice telephone conversation.  Some
people distribute their key fingerprint on their business cards,
which looks really cool.
<P>For current versions of PGP, the key fingerprint is computed using 
the MD5 hash function.  A future version of PGP will optionally use a
new and different hash function, SHA, instead of MD5.
<P>If you don't know me, please don't call me to verify my key over the
phone -- I get too many calls like that.  Since every PGP user has a
copy of my public key, no one could tamper with all the copies that
are out there.  The discrepancy would soon be noticed by someone who
checked it from more than one source, and word would soon get out on
the Internet.
<P>For those of you who want to verify my public key (included in the
standard PGP release package), here are the particulars:
<PRE>
     UserID: "Philip R. Zimmermann &lt;prz@acm.org&gt;"
     Key Size: 1024 bits;  Creation date: 21 May 1993;  KeyID: C7A966DD
     Key fingerprint:  9E 94 45 13 39 83 5F 70  7B E7 D8 ED C4 BE 5A A6
</PRE>
The information printed above conceivably could still be tampered
with in the electronic distribution of the PGP User's Guide.  But if
you read this in the printed version of the manual, available in
bookstores from MIT Press, it's a safe bet that it really is my own
key's fingerprint.

   Has anyone been working on a pgp interface for MIME ?


here's what a friend of mine have been using (under mhn):

mhn-show-application/x-pgp: %ppgp -m %F
mhn-store-application/x-pgp: %m%P.pgp

which seems to work fine.  i initially tried text/x-pgp but for some
reason the encrypted file wasn't being transferred properly.  i don't
use the -a option of pgp.  so the procedure is much like this:

 edit file
 pgp -e file user_name
 comp
  [insert proper directives for mhn to insert a application/x-pgp file]
 send the message and delete the original files.

works like a charm.  now if i could only get mh to auto-encrypt my
messages, i'd be a really happy camper.

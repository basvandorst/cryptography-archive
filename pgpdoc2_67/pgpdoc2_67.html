<H2>Restrictions on Commercial Use of PGP</H2>
<P>The freeware version of PGP is for personal, non-commercial use.  For
commercial use in the USA or Canada, contact ViaCrypt in Phoenix,
Arizona (phone 602 944-0773, or email viacrypt@acm.org).
<P>I made an agreement with ViaCrypt in the summer of 1993 to license the
exclusive commercial rights to PGP, so that there would be a way for
corporations to use PGP without risk of a patent infringement lawsuit
from PKP.  For PGP to succeed in the long term as a viable industry
standard, the legal stigma associated with the RSA patent rights had
to be resolved.  ViaCrypt had already obtained a patent license from
PKP to make, use, and sell products that practice the RSA patents.
ViaCrypt offered a way out of the patent quagmire for PGP to penetrate
the corporate environment.  They could sell a fully-licensed version
of PGP, but only if I licensed it to them under these terms.  So we
entered into an agreement to do that, opening the door for PGP's
future in the commercial sector, which was necessary for PGP's
long-term political future.
<P>Therefore, regardless of the complexities and partially overlapping
restrictions from all the other terms and conditions imposed by the
various patent and copyright licenses (RSA, RSAREF, and IDEA) from
various third parties, an additional overriding restriction on PGP
usage is imposed by my own agreement with ViaCrypt: The freeware
version of PGP is only for personal, non-commercial use -- all other
users in the USA and Canada must obtain a fully licensed version of
PGP from ViaCrypt.  The restrictions imposed by my agreement with
ViaCrypt do not apply outside the USA or Canada.
<P>Finally, if you want to turn PGP into a commercial product and make
money selling it, then we must agree on a way for me to also make
money on it.  If you use PGP in such a manner that you must pay
patent royalties or any other software licensing fees to the patent
holders for any cryptographic algorithms used by PGP, then we must
agree on a way for me to also be paid in some manner.  Buying PGP
from ViaCrypt is one way to meet this requirement.

           Eudora Translation API Support Code           -----------------------------------You're free to use, modify and redistribute the source here!emsapi-mac.h-----------Include file which defines constants, data structures andfunction prototypes needed for a translation API module implementation.emsapi-component.c-----------------Component Manager glue file. Compile this into your translator module to save yourself the trouble of setting up the Component Manager calling interface. It supplies a "main" for the Component and expects the functions prototyped in emsapi-mac.h to be linked with it. The Developer's Documentation gives some additional details about using this file. Strictly speaking this file is not required, but it is recommended.usertrans.h sample------------------Template of the file usertrans.h that you must modify and put in the include path in order to use emsapi-component.c.FatTransComponent.rsrc sample-----------------------------Some of the resources needed to build a Fat Translator Component (the "thng"resource). See the Developer's Documentation for exact details.tldrive.c & tldrive.rsrc------------------------A C source file and resource with which you can test yourtranslator without the hassle of building a Component. Statically linktldrive.c into an _application_ project with your translator modulesource and it provides buttons and dialogs to call various functions in atranslator. It replaces the Component main and provides a way to call individual translators with different arguments, though it does not emulate the way Eudora calls a translator module.mimetype--------Manipulates the MIME type data structures passed across the API.rfc1847-------Implements the multipart/signed MIME type as defined in RFC1847copycat-------String functions used by mimetype.c, rfc1847.c and tldrive.clglio.c-------IO functions used by rfc1847.c

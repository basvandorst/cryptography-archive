PGPnet secures all TCP/IP communications betweenitself and any other machine running PGPnet. It is also highly interoperablewith the Gauntlet GVPN firewall/gateway product family providing a completesolution for corporate remote access VPNs using the industry standard IPSec(Internet Protocol Security) and IKE (Internet Key Exchange) protocols.PGPnet has been successfully tested with Cisco routers(requires Cisco IOS12.0(4) or later with IPSec TripleDES), Linux FreeS/WAN, and many others.PGPnet is also the first IPSec product to fully support the use of OpenPGPkeys for authentication in addition to X.509.</font></li><br>&nbsp;<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>Self-Decrypting Archives.</b> You may nowencrypt files or folders into Self-Decrypting Archives (SDA) which canbe used by users who do not even have PGP. The archives are completelyindependent of any application, compressed and protected by PGP's strongcryptography.</font></li><br>&nbsp;<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>X.509 Certificate and CA Support.</b> PGPis now able to interoperate with the X.509 certificate format. This isthe format used by most web browsers for securing the transfer of web pages.PGP supports the request of certificates from Network Associates' Net ToolsPKI, VeriSign's OnSite, and Entrust certificate authorities. X.509 certificatesare analogous to a PGP signature, so you can even request X.509 certificateson your existing PGP key. This feature can also be used to interoperatewith existing VPN solutions based on X.509.</font></li><br>&nbsp;<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>Integrated PGP Command Line.</b> This versionincorporates the popular command line version of PGP for Windows platforms.This product provides you a convenient way to integrate PGP with otherWindows applications and automated processes on your desktop system. Pleasenote that this is intended for single user/workstation use. For use onservers, customers are required to purchase the PGP Command Line/BatchServer product. Please contact your local Network Associates Sales representativefor more information.</font></li><br>&nbsp;<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>Automated Freespace Wiping. </b>PGP's FreespaceWipe feature now allows you to use the Windows Task Scheduler to scheduleperiodic secure wiping of the freespace on your disk.</font></li><br>&nbsp;<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>Hotkeys. </b>The Use Current Window featurehas been significantly enhanced by the addition of Hotkeys. By pressingthe configured key combination, the Encrypt/Decrypt/Sign functions canbe automatically invoked in zero clicks without using PGPtray.</font></li><br>&nbsp;<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>Fingerprint Word List.</b> When verifyinga PGP public key fingerprint, you can now choose to view the fingerprintas a word list instead of hexadecimal characters. The word list in thefingerprint text box is made up of special authentication words that PGPuses and are carefully selected to be phonetically distinct and easy tounderstand without phonetic ambiguity.</font></li><br>&nbsp;<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>Support for Outlook 2000 and Outlook Express5.0. </b>This version of PGP adds support for sending and receiving encryptede-mail in Microsoft Outlook 2000 and Outlook Express 5.0.</font></li><br>&nbsp;<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>HTTP Proxy Support.</b> If you are behinda corporate firewall with an HTTP proxy server, PGP now supports accessingHTTP keyservers through the proxy. To use this feature, you must configurethe proxy server address in your Internet Explorer preferences.</font></li><br>&nbsp;<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>Smart Word Wrapping.</b> The word wrappingin PGP now automatically rewraps paragraphs and even quoted paragraphsresulting in much cleaner signed messages.</font></li></ol><p><br><a NAME="Docs"></a><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+1>DOCUMENTATION</font></font></b><p><font face="Arial">Also included with this release are the followingmanuals, which can be viewed on-line as well as printed:</font><ul><ul><li><font face="Arial">Introduction to Cryptography</font></li><li><font face="Arial">PGP Installation Guide</font></li><li><font face="Arial">PGP User's Guide</font></li></ul></ul><font face="Arial">Each document is saved in Adobe Acrobat Portable DocumentFormat (.PDF).

PGPnet supportsWindows 95b (OSR2), Windows 98 and Windows NT 4.0.</font></dir></dir><a NAME="Issues"></a><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+1>KNOWN ISSUES</font></font></b><p><b><i><u><font face="Arial">PGP ISSUES</font></u></i></b><ol><ol><li><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The maximum size for RSA keys is 2048 bits.This is due to limitations in the RSA libraries and our desire to remainbackward-compatible with previous versions of PGP. (Some previous versionsof PGP did function with large RSA keys, but creation of these keys hasnever been supported.)</font></li><br>&nbsp;<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mismatching your keyring files can resultin data loss. Your public keyring file and private keyring file must bekept in sync. If, for instance, you select a public keyring file that doesnot contain the public portion of your private key and do not also changethe private keyring to the corresponding file, you and others will notbe able to encrypt to exported versions of your key after that time. Inmost cases, simply updating your key from a public copy on a keyserverwill fix this. However, it is recommended that the keyring files alwaysbe kept in sync. A future version is expected to correct this issue.</font></li><br>&nbsp;<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Using a Split Key as a public key for PGPdiskwill not allow reconstitution of the key through the usual dialog providedfor reconstituting split keys. To use such a key to open a PGPdisk, youmust first rejoin the key in PGPkeys.</font></li><br>&nbsp;<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Some PGP Versions 6.0 and later features areincompatible with previous versions of PGP, so we feature a "compatible"export format that strips incompatible features such as Photo IDs and X.509certificates from keys. Selecting "Include 6.X Extensions" in the Exportdialog enables these features to be exported. By default, we export incompatible mode. You may change the default in the Advanced preferencesdialog. When sending a key to a PGP Certificate Server Version 2.0 or above,Photo IDs always accompany the key. The default LDAP server in PGP 6.xsupports this.</font></li><br>&nbsp;<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Sometimes, after a PGPdisk volume is unmountedand placed in the Recycle Bin and the Bin is emptied, Windows reports thatthe drive letter associated with the PGPdisk volume is no longer accessible.This behavior should cease after the system is rebooted. This will notinterfere with the normal operation of your system.</font></li><br>&nbsp;<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On Windows 95/98, the Free Space Wiper willreset every time another program writes to your disk while the wiping processis in progress. This is similar to defragmentation programs, and is requiredby the Operating System. For optimal wiping, make sure to close all openapplications. On some systems with very low amounts of RAM, it may be advisableto also shutdown Windows Explorer.</font></li><br>&nbsp;<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Windows Explorer provides PGP with informationonly about the target of a shortcut and not the shortcut itself. If youuse the Wipe feature in the Explorer, the shortcut itself will not be wiped.The actual target will be wiped. When using PGPtools, the shortcut willalso be wiped.</font></li><br>&nbsp;<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Hotkeys are for use with applications thatsupport general text editing. Using Hotkeys with some applications mayresult in unpredictable behavior.</font></li><br>&nbsp;<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Hard disk utilities (such as ScanDisk) orprograms that monitor the hard disk will not run on a drive on which aPGPdisk volume is mounted. This is to insure that the PGPdisk volume doesnot become corrupted. To use your hard disk utilities, unmount all PGPdiskvolumes on the drive on which you wish to use the utilities.</font></li><br>&nbsp;<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica">PGPdisk volumes accessed using an AdditionalDecryption Key open with permissions set as follows: FAT volumes open withpermissions set to read-only; NTFS volumes open with permissions set toread/write.</font></li><br>&nbsp;<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica">(Windows 98 only) If you create a PGPdiskwhich you plan to immediately copy to a different drive, we recommend thatyou reboot before doing so to make sure everything is written correctly.This is only a potential issue just after the creation of the PGPdisk,and is due to a Windows 98 disk caching bug.</font></li><br>&nbsp;<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Versions of PGP later than 5.0 do not supportusing Microsoft Word as an email editor.</font></li><br>&nbsp;<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We strongly recommend that VirusScan usersupgrade to the latest version of VirusScan to take advantage of the newestvirus DAT file update features.</font></li></ol></ol><b><i><u>PGPNET ISSUES</u></i></b><ol><ol><li><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Do not attempt to manually uninstall PGPnet.It is very important that you use the PGP Uninstaller to remove PGPnet.PGPnet makes extensive modifications to the registry and changes the bindingson network adapters. The PGP Uninstaller can be accessed via the Add/RemovePrograms control panel.</font></li><br>&nbsp;<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica">[Windows NT only] As a precautionary measure,in the unusual event that there is a incompatibility between your networkcard driver and PGPnet, you can create a "No Networking" hardware profileprior to installing PGPnet on your system. The "No Networking" hardwareprofile can be used later if an incompatibility occurs.</font></li><br>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">To create a "No Networking" hardware profile,right click on "My Computer," select Properties, and then select the HardwareProfiles tab. Use the Copy button to create a copy of the Original Configuration.Get Properties on your copied configuration and click the Network tab.Finally, select the "Network-disabled hardware profile" checkbox. ClickOK to both windows and then you are done. (Due to a Windows bug we recommendthat you restart once and double-check that the "No Networking" configurationis working before you install PGPnet.)</font><br>&nbsp;<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica">[Windows 95 only] You may experience a lossof networking after resuming from standby mode. You must reboot your machineto resume network activity.</font></li><br>&nbsp;<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica">PGPnet 6.5.1 is not compatible with the IntelEtherExpress 16 driver.</font></li></ol></ol><a NAME="Y2K"></a><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+1>YEAR 2000 COMPLIANCE</font></font></b><p><font face="Arial">Information regarding NAI products that are Year2000 compliant and its Year 2000 standards and testing models may be obtainedfrom NAI's website at http://www.nai.com/y2k.</font><p><font face="Arial">For further information, email <a href="mailto:y2k@nai.com">y2k@nai.com</a>.</font><br>&nbsp;<p><a NAME="Contact_NAI"></a><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+1>CONTACTINGNETWORK ASSOCIATES</font></font></b><p><b><i><u>FOR QUESTIONS, ORDERS, PROBLEMS, OR COMMENTS</u></i></b><br>&nbsp;<p><b><font face="Arial">Contact the Network Associates Customer Care department:</font></b><br>&nbsp;<p><font face="Arial">Phone (408) 988-3832 Monday-Friday, 6:00 A.M. - 6:00P.M.

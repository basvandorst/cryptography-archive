NSLOOKUP - name server lookup for Windows - Version 1.1

It requires a working Winsock and Windows 3.1.

It enables you to query nameservers anywhere on the Internet for any kind 
of supported name record.

This program is one element of WigWam for the Internet,
a forthcoming off-line news and mail reader from Ashmount Research Ltd.

This will be an extension of the existing range of off-line readers for 
remote services, such as Compuserve, CIX and BIX, and the local 
conferencing and email application - PowWow. 

WigWam for the Internet will allow you to gather news and mail in bulk 
over a SLIP or other WINSOCK network connection, read and reply to
it off-line, and send the replies the next time you connect.

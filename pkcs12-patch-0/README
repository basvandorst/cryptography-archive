This is an early patch for PKCS#12 support in SSLeay. It has been tested and
is known to work with Netscape 4.04 and MSIE 4 implementations.

See the file crypto/pkcs12/COPYRIGHT for conditions of use. 

The patch is meant to be applied to SSLeay 0.8.1. To use it go to the SSLeay
main directory and type:
patch -p1 < pkcs12.diff
If you are in luck it will have worked. If SSLeay is not plain 0.8.1 and you
have modified some things (like objects.h) then you may need to apply some of
the patches manually.

If it patches OK then after the usual config commands try:
make links
make errors
make install

If you are still in luck then all will compile OK and you will have a
new application linked into the ssleay binary called pkcs12 (oddly enough).

I get lots of email about the patch not working. These are almost exclusively
due to either not using a valid "patch" program (e.g. the GNU version is OK) 
or not doing the three "make" commands above in the right order. If you don't
do the three make commands in the right order you *will* get compilation
errors because some files are autogenerated (and I don't include them in
the patch to keep the patch size down).

Info about using the pkcs12 program is in doc/pkcs12.doc

Only the password based encryption modes are supported at present. Enveloping
stuff will be added later, when full PKCS#7 support is in SSLeay.

There is preliminary API documentation in doc/pk12api.doc . If you haven't
read the current PKCS#12 draft then this probably wont make much sense.

All comments are welcomed. However since I don't get paid for this don't expect
large amounts of free consultancy :-) Large amounts of paid consultancy are
quite another matter however ...

This is Central Point Software's terminology.  Non-expert mode allows you
to recover the key whereas expert mode does not.  "Mode" is not used in the
same sense as in "ECB mode".  In fact CPS's implementation of DES is DES in
ECB mode.

PCSECURE implements DES only in ECB mode.  The Private Line and MERLIN have
ECB as their default mode, although they also implement CBC and other modes.
I did not "select" ECB for testing, I simply noticed the anomalies in the
byte value frequencies in files encrypted using the default modes of these
encryption programs and proceeded to investigate further.

Perhaps you'll admit (a) that my demonstrating that DES in ECB mode is
insecure shows that I know something about how to detect insecurity in
encryption software, and (b) that it is reasonable to suppose that I have
applied the same tests (frequency analyses, randomness measures and
repetition searches) to our own encryption software to test for insecurity.
(See something on this in Part II which follows.)  In addition, there are
reasons to believe that Dolphin Software's encryption software is consider-
ably more secure than DES, which reasons will be presented to anyone for
their consideration if they request information.
 
This reply by Steve, which I have just received on the evening of 1/18/92,
is to the second DES-related article I posted on 1/16/92.  Before receiving
Steve's reply I posted (on the morning of 1/18/92) a third DES-related
article along the same lines, which I probably would not have done (at
least without revision) had I received Steve's reply earlier.

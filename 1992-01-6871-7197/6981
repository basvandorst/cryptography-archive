Patents are _not_ retroactive.

"The grant of a patent gives [the patent owner] a 17 year monopoly on the
invention defined by the claims of the patent, beginning with the date of
issuance of the patent."  -- from "Patent It Yourself", David Pressman.
(This is a very useful book if you're interested in patents.)

A patent application gives an inventor no rights whatsoever.  The only
reason "Patent Pending" would keep people from copying the invention
is that they would have to stop if the patent issues, and they would
lose their manufacturing investment.

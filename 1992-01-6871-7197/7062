I don't recall the history of this, but, ....

If Phil is not a U S Citizen (or posting from a U S location), RSA can't
get to him.  They would have to go after people in the U S.  The U S is
only country that recognizes the RSA patent, because of previous
publication (and not accepting software patents.)

If he is, they can go after him for inducing others to infringe the patent.
It seems clear he was not infringing himself.   Personally, I think his
disclaimers in the code are sufficient to defend against that, but I am not
a lawyer, and the law doesn't provide adequate protection against suits
without basis in law, so he could very easily feel he had to withdraw it. 
(Yes, I saw the code.  I didn't keep it.)

And.... in misc.int-property, (and CompuServe's LAWSIG), I've seen messages
stating that, in a patent infringement suit, a defense that the patent is
invalid must be considered before evidence of infringement can be
introduced.

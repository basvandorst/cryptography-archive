What is the current general wisdom on FEAL? I implemented FEAL-8 from
the spec and have been playing with it, but I've heard that it is a
weak cipher (even the spec mentions that Shamir apparently found a
chosen-plaintext attack).  I've heard rumors of strengthened versions
of FEAL (FEAL-32?) but I don't have copies of the specs or any idea of
their strengths.

Comments?

Phil

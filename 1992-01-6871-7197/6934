I've been thinking about this quite a bit over lunch.  Us wild animals
don't write to well when we're hungry, you know, and any article posted
just before lunch can be rather confusing...

Anyway, there is a key difference between telephone listings and
VCR+ codes/(date, channel, time, duration) 4-tuples:

   There is no way, short of explicit enumeration, to get from
   a person's name to his/her telephone number or back.

   There is a way, developed by Gemstar, to get from a (date,
   channel, time, duration) 4-tuple to a VCR+ code and back
   without explicit enumeration of all possibilities. 

I don't know if that is sufficient "creative" expression to fall
under copyright law.  But it is enough to prove that VCR+ codes
are a horse of a different color than telephone directory entries.

BTW, I called the _Rocky Mountain News_ (which publishes the VCR+
codes) and asked if they pay, or are paid by, Gemstar for the use
of VCR+ codes.  They have an "exclusive" contract for them in
the Denver area (meaning the other big daily doesn't get them,
I guess).  The woman I needed to talk to was out, and of course
there's no guarantee the newspaper will answer my question, but
others may want to try the same with their local newspapers.

There are three basic mechanisms for protecting information (in the U.S.):
copyright, patent, and trade secret.  Trade secrets give you legal
protection against things like someone else hiring your employees -- you
can get an injunction, if necessary, barring them from disclosing your
secrets.  But it's perfectly legal to reverse-engineer products to discover
how they work.

Patents, in general, can be granted for ideas that are new, useful, and
non-obvious.  That VCR+ meets the first two criteria is beyond doubt --
there was nothing like it on the market (to be sure, someone else could
have conceived of the same idea earlier, but been unable or unwilling
to market it), and people find it useful enough to spend a lot of money
on.  Non-obvious?  Well, the notion of 4-digit codes for popular
programs certainly simplifies programming a VCR, at least for some
people.  It would seem, then, that the concept of the VCR+ is
patentable.  And that patent could -- depending on the exact claims --
bar anyone else from building, selling, or *using* a device that uses
the same principles to either generate or decode the numbers.  The
general scheme would have to be public knowledge -- but on sci.crypt I
certainly don't have to explain how different tables (``keys'') could
be used to customize the device.  Are any patent numbers listed on
the unit?  Does anyone reading this have access to a patent database
that would list patents assigned to Gemstar?  To be sure, they may have
applied for a patent, but not yet received one, and in this country
patent applications are confidential.

Finally, several people have suggested that the program listings could
be copyrighted.  I doubt it.  Copyrights protect *creative*
expressions.  Something that is generated by a mechanical process is
*not* copyrightable.  In fact, the courts (again, in the U.S.) have
recently ruled that phone books are not protectable by copyright law,
for that very reasons.

Lets hope its copyright, then to go to court they will have to register
with the copyright office and make all the data public. Isn't it
amazing that to claim property rights to something you have to disclose
to the public what the property is? I haven't seen any disclosure yet.
Why doesn't Gemstar, if they read the net, tell us 'poor souls' what
legal protection they claim or forever hold their peace?

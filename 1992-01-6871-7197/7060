It takes a SparcStation IPC 50 seconds, using a suitable algorithm, to
try all of /usr/dict/words (25,000 words) against an encrypted password.

There's not much point trying to shorten the word list by eliminating
words less likely to be passwords, especially if it involves major
efforts like collecting and analyzing samples of the user's writing.

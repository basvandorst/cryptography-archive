If Gemstar is getting royalties for the publication of the actual
codes, it is probably under Trademark and Patent protection -- in the
same way that Pantone expects a royalty if you specify a color to a
printer using their nomenclature.  They may also hold a Copyright on
the "language" or "grammar" that effects the translation from a code to
a sequence of VCR commands.  In that case, you could *not* build a
device that produces the same output from the same codes -- that would
definitely constitute infringement.

As you note, trade secret protection is *no* protection against
reverse- engineering.  But remember, it might take a jury to decide
that, and you'd have to pay a retainer to an attorney to defend you if
named in any complaint.

CAVEAT: I'm not an attorney, but I am the holder of patents, and I have
been a defendant in intellectual property suits.  It behooves you to
get the best possible advice available, but *only* from an attorney
with regular trial experience.  Business litigation is usually a poker
game, and a good hand combined with an experienced player makes for a
better chance of success.  Just remember that in law, as in poker, the
second-best hand is always the most expensive.

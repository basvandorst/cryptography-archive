Not to detract from your other points, but this is indeed a DES key,
As defined in the original DES specification, the eighth bit of every
byte is defined to be an odd parity bit. Most software I've seen
implements keys without the parity bit, leaving seven bytes, but I
have used software which required the eight byte format with parity.

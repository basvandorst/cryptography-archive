Can some one post which FTP sites archive sci.electronics or sci.crypt?

I'm more interested than ever to see how the VCR+ code works.  I'm going
to find out how the code works no matter what happens.

I'm beginning to believe that Gemstar has no patents on the VCR+.  
If they did, they wouldn't care who knows that patented code scheme.
Even if a patent was applied for, they shouldn't care less because
they will be covered by the patent once it is issued.  Unless Gemstar
cannot get a patent on their scheme so they have resorted to Trade
Secret protection.  Which I don't believe they are stupid enough
to resort to.  They must be trying to protect their intellectual
property rights in some manner, I just can't figure out how.

In any case, they shouldn't be going around threatening people.
Reverse Engineering is legimate (sp?).  No one is stealing their
material.  I bet they don't have a leg to stand on if they did try
to sue.

How about those FTP sites!

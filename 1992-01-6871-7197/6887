"Giving away something stolen is                                            
just as wrong as selling it.        "                                   
 
With regards to revealing the VCR+ code encryption scheme.
 
Sharing an understanding with collegues is not stealing
if that understanding did not exploit information 
gathered while in a position of trust.
                                                   
Cracking and publishing this code will encourage future
efforts to use more secure means of encryption and   
possibly improve the state of the art.

Caving in to fear of litigation regardless of how otherwise
the litigating company deserves a profit only gutters
the candle of understanding.

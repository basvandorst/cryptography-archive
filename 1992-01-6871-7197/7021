>asked in sci.crypt about PGP (Phil Zimmermann's Pretty Good Privacy).

	Too bad the code's kind of scrotty. It'd be really interesting
to see what happened if someone ported it to UNIX and put it out for FTP
in Finland or someplace. (Yes, I looked at porting it, but it's got a
lot of MS-DOGisms in it. Not that that's bad - statistically, when you
say computer, you're talking a DOS box...)

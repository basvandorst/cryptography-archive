With regard to the VCR+ coding scheme, it strikes me that the company
in question is trying to have its cake and eat it.

(NB. Disclaimer: these are moral opinions, not legal ones.  If you want
legal advice, and especially if you intend to act on it, see a lawyer).

Trade secrets are meant to be exactly that: secrets.  Yet it would
appear that the company has published (or has by contract allowed others
to publish) sufficient information for an outsider to deduce the secret.

Of course, they are under no obligation to publish anything, and if they
do they are perfectly entitled to attempt to encrypt it sufficiently
well to withstand reverse-engineering.  However, if they do decide to
(effectively) publish their algorithm in encrypted form, and someone
cracks the cipher, then (IMHO) tough.

Furthermore, consider what would happen if computer manufacturers applied
the same attitude.  Suppose Intel could make the 80x86 instruction set a
trade secret, and demanded royalties from anyone who wrote a program for
their chip.  Suppose IBM made the MSDOS API a trade secret, and demanded
royalties from anyone who wrote a program that called DOS.

Incompatible standards are bad enough, but proprietry standards are the
start of a very slippery slope.

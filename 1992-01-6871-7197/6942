The device says Patent Pending.

I don't think so.  A patent is valid whether you tell people about it or
not.  And you don't have to enforce it.  You can let people violate your
patent for years, and then decide one day to enforce it.

As far as I know (which isn't very far) you are under no obligation
to tell anyone about your patent.

However, if you want to prevent people from using your patented
device, you should tell them about it; and putting a message on your
product is a good way to do this.

A pending patent is also worthless.  If the patent hasn't been granted,
then there is no patent, and they have no rights until the day that it
is granted.

And, if they have a patent on the algorithm, then the algorithm is
public knowledge.  I could just get a copy of the patent and post it. 

They have, or are getting, a patent on the device.  I don't think that
they will try to use that keep us from releasing our program.  I think
they are trying to use the copyright laws.  We expect to hear the
details of their legal position in about a week.  Unless I'm advised
otherwise, I will post a summary of this.

Trade secret laws could only be used if I had a contract with them,
written or implied - which I don't.  Those laws could, for example,
be used if one of their employees gave us the information - but they
give them no protection in this case.

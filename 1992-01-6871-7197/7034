According to the UK magazine "What Video" February 1992:

GemStar have pledged to reveal the algorithm for VCR+ if they become
insolvent.  It's currently kept in a fireproof safe in Pasadena.

Another tidbit - the controllers are made in Hong Kong (after all, the
co-inventors were born there) and the factory gets the Speaking Clock
continuously relayed from the UK to use when setting the time (the
controllers are shipped to the UK with batteries in and set to the
right time zone - I guess this would be a bit harder in the US as you
have several zones).

Hi there netland.  I am looking for a source of hardware (ie commercially
available chips) to perform DES encryption/decryption in semi-realtime.
This is for use when sending information via modems over dedicated lines.
So speeds of approx 9600 baud are expected.  Any help, direction etc would
be appreciated.  Sorry if this information is in the FAQ file, but I
couldn't find it.

Thanks, Niall.

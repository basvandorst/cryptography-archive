Wrong again.  Posting on Usenet has grants a right to redistribute
on the Usenet (and probably connected networks), and probably to quote
messages (preserving attribution) for the purpose of commenting on them. 
Other rights, including hard-copy distribution may be reserved by the
author.

Your specific flames were commented on (and agreed to, for the most part)
by better-written articles.

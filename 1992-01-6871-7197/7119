 Hello--
 
  I've been a hobbiest in Codes and Ciphers for a few years, from simple 
subsitution style codes and scrambling methond on up the line.  I was 
hoping that someone might know of a good source of software related software 
for DOS.  CBW or similar would be nice, I don't have resources advible to 
munge code for use on DOS (or the time).
 
Is there an archive somewhere for this type of stuff?  Analytical software, 
other methods (source and programs) and texts are all of interest.

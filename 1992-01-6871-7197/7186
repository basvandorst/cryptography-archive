In Knuth Vol 2, section 3.1 (intro to the random number generator chapter),
on pp. 4-5, he relates the following:

	"It is not easy to invent a fool-proof random-number generator.
[...] [the author] attempted to creat e a fantastically good random-number
generator using the following peculiar method:"

	[algorithm -- very complex -- 13 steps with many loop possibilities]

	"(The machine-language program corresponding to the above algorithm
was intended to be so complicated that a man reading a listing of it
without explanatory comments would not know what the program was doing.)

	"With all the precautions taken in [this algorithm], doesn't it
seem plausible that it would produce at least an infinite supply of
unbelievably random numbers?  No!  In fact, when this algorithm was first
put onto a computer, it almost immediately converged to the 10-digit value
6065038420. [...]"

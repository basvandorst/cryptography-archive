This is answering the question, "Why not just make a VCR that's easy to 
program?  Then you don't even need VCR+."

Technology-phobes LOVE this product.  They don't have to deal with on screen
menus or even read their VCR manual, which they probably threw out or lost
anyway.  All they do is type one number into the VCR+ remote, make sure a tape
is in the VCR and forget about it.  Let's face it, some people are just that
way with electronic devices.  Making the VCR's easy to program doesn't seem
to help some people, since such VCR's exsist today.  Computers in all 
elementary schools should help this problem, if the teachers in charge of 
the computer classrooms are not technology-phobes also (my wife is majoring 
in elementary education and specializing in computers, so I am aware of this 
problem also).

VCR+ might also be useful to people with cheap VCR's with programming 
limitations.

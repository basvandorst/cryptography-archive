It won't help you, because the OCR software looks for fonts, not
bars.

To get your mail directly to the barcode reader (where the OCR
output goes), it must be specially trayed and marked.  Discounts
are available for large quantities, but it'll take some special
effort, and the overt cooperation of your local post office peo-
ple, to get small, non-discounted mail to that barcode reader.

For the specs you need for printing barcodes inside the address
block (not along the bottom of the envelope) contact the USPS
representative who covers your area and ask for publication:
"BARCODE UPDATE".  This booklet, dated September 1991, has no
part number, so you have to ask for it by name.

C code for the bar codes is published in an Addison-Wesley book
called: HP LaserJet Programming, by Binstock, Babcock, and Luse.
I used it as a source for BASIC code that we use here for these
mailings, and recommend the book.

Good luck on your project.

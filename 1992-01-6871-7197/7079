The problem with this method is that anyone who can listen in on
all three messages can perform a known-plaintext attack on the
encryption.  The first intuition of people may be to use one-time
pad for the encryption.  It certainly meets all the requirements
to get the correct message to the recipient --- a false analysis
of the situation would say that since one-time pads can't be broken,
then this new scheme can't be broken.  However, a little thought
will reveal that since known-plaintext attacks on one-time pads
are trivial, so is breaking the above protocol.

The lesson:  be careful with this method!  Known plaintext attacks
are easy for some secure cryptographics schemes, and so using those
schemes here totally destroys your security.

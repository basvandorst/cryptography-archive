Hi all.  As mentioned in previous posts, New York, like most
states, assigns driver's license numbers based on the personal
data appearing on the license (see also Gallian, "Assigning
Driver's License Numbers", Mathematics Magazine Feb. 1991).

The New York State Department of Motor Vehicles will not reveal
the assignment scheme, not even under its or the state's general
freedom of information act (see also [DMV] Commissioner's
Regulations, Part 160).

Previously, I announced that I had solved the code, and would
post the answer shortly, but that I was hoping to get my name
in print somewhere first.  This is still true.

There is a new twist, however: although I have no samples to
confirm it either way, it's possible that NY uses a different
code for people with short last names (3 letters or less). My
solution works in all cases where the last name is at least
4 letters long, but I have reason to believe it might not be
right for short names.

So (finally) my request:  if you have a New York State driver's
license, AND your last name is 3 letters or less, could you
please send me your driver's license number (the first line of
the number will be sufficient), and your name as it appears on
the license: last,first,middle.  Your contribution will be 
greatly appreciated.


I will be posting the answer to these groups soon.
Thanks.

Well, I've finally got a copy of the paper describing
Biham and Shamir's new attack on DES (thanks Eli!).

A quick summary - it is a chosen-plaintext attack, requiring
approximately 2^47 plaintexts (yes, the rumours were correct).

To save further explanation, I'll simply type in the first page
verbatim.

	Abstract

  In this paper we develop the first known attack which is capable of breaking
the full 16 round DES in less than the 2^55 complexity of exhaustive search.
The data analysis phase computes the key by analyzing about 2^36 ciphertexts
in 2^37 time. The 2^36 usable ciphertexts are obtained during the data
collection phase from a pool of 2^47 chosen plaintexts by a simple bit
repetition criteria which discards more than 99.9% of the ciphertexts as soon
as they are generated. While earlier versions of differential attacks were
based on huge counter arrays, the new attack can be carried out even if the
analyzed ciphertexts are derived from up to 2^33 different keys due to frequent
key changes during the data collection phase. The attack can be carried out
incrementally with any number of available ciphertexts, and probability of
success grows linearly with this number (e.g., when 2^29 usable ciphertexts
are generated from a smaller pool of 2^40 plaintexts, the analysis time
decreases to 2^30 and the probability of success is about 1%).


I haven't studied the paper carefully, but from what I've read, it appears
they've managed to overcome the signal/noise problems in the old version,
and make use of a 13 round characteristic (with prob 2^-47) to break the
16 round DES. The old version had to use a 15 round attack.

The paper is 10 pages long, and is available from Technion Comp Sci Dept,
where it is Technical Report #708.

Please don't ask me any difficult questions about it, since I retired
from cryptography last week ;-)

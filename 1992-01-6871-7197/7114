I do that with my VCR, and have been doing so long before anyone ever heard
of VCR+.  In fact, my old VCR (a Hitachi 5000, with mechanical "piano" keys)
got it right by being dumb, not by being smart.  I pressed "record", then
set the timer, then activated the timer.  The machine wasn't smart enough
to know that the recording had been started manually and not by the timer,
and just kept going until the timer told it to stop.

On my not-so-old VCR, there is a "fast record" option.  You can press
record, then press a button which increments a counter by half hour
steps.  After you've stopped pressing the button, the machine will
use that counter to determine when to stop.

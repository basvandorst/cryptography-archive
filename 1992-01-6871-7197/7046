      The last several attempts to do so have resulted in cypher systems
that were broken.  Early attempts at a public key system were based
on the knapsack problem, and that was solved, breaking the system.
Several other suggested techniques were also shot down.  Most recently,
techniques using digital logarithms have been shown to be vulnerable.

      The basic problem is that you need a problem that is known to be
"hard" in a certain way.  The theory of lower bounds is not well enough
advanced that you can prove that a problem is hard.  (Many "NP-hard"
problems are hard for the worst case, but not necessarily hard for
the average case.  NP-hardness isn't good enough here.)

      So the best we can do today is to base a system on a problem
that many good mathematicians have spent years working on without
finding a good solution.  Factoring of numbers has been worked on
for a long time by many people, so there's some feeling for how
hard the problem is.  

      With some newly developed function, one that doesn't have a 
few man-centuries of heavy thinkers beating their heads against the
wall trying to solve it, there's no guarantee that someobody won't 
find a trick that breaks it.  History in cryptanalysis suggests that
somebody will.

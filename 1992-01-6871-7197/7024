Can anyone speak to the question of USING something that is patented if
one didn't pay for it.  Since the PGP package is now obviously ubiquitous
(and a portable Unix version inevitable) what if anything prevents us from
setting up a public key archive that we can all enter our keys into and
then just using this thing.  It may all be very illegal but I would like
to know if so and how so.

If it can be ascertained that we are not breaking the law by using this
thing let's do so and get on with it.  If I am not mistaken, I can make
and personally use anything that is patented, I just can't sell it. Right
or wrong?

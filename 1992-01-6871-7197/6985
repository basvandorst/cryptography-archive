For those who wanted info about FEAL:

FEAL is Fast Encipherment ALgorithm.  Designed by Miyaguchi et al of
NTT (the Japanese equivalent of British Telecom and Ma Bell.)

It's not patented AFAIK.

FEAL is designed to be implemented on small processors and all of its
calculations are on bytes.  The 8 in FEAL-8 refers to the number of
rounds, or iterations of the data randomizing process.

You must not, under any circumstances, use FEAL-8 in ECB mode.

The current spec is in the Proceedings of CRYPTO '90, published by
Springer-Verlag.

It's really easy to implement from the spec.  It's designed to be
assembly coded and would be a real dog in C because it uses lots of 8
bit rotates, which C cannot do in any reasonable way.

P.S.  There's all sorts of other goodies in CRYPTO '90 apart from
FEAL; buy a copy & see...

Maybe this guy would be happier if he replaced DES with an encryption
program that XORed his data with a hardware random number generator.
He could then boast that his revolutionary new encryption scheme not
only has ideal ciphertext statistics, but it is also completely
unbreakable by anyone (including the intended recipient...)

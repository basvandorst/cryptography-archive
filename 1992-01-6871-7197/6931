The "creative" in "creative expression" is a can of worms.

My software is clearly a "creative expression."  The graphics file 
generated by an artist controlling a graphics package is clearly
a "creative expression."

Is the graphics file created by my software a "creative expression,"
since it is derived from NWS data files without human intervention?
Do those files have any "intelluctual property" protection?  What
about the original NWS data files -- which are computer generated
without human intervention?

This is arguable, especially in my software's case (since it simply
contours the NWS data), since any work-alike program should generate
the _same_ output.

But there is no reason why "4th, Channel 3, 9:00 pm, 1 hour" should
be a "734" instead of a "312."  In fact, you could generate 1000's
of different (date, channel, time, duration), VCR+code combinations.
The fact that their codes alone will function properly with their
equipment would seem to entitle Gemstar to some form of "intellectual
property right" for their codes.

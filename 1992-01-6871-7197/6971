I am searching for a good public domain program that will produce the
postal bar codes that are seen on the lower edge of some mail.  As I 
understand it, this code will help your mail go through faster, by
zipping it through the OCR software faster.  I want this code to be in
C preferably so I can use it on any machine, but a version for the Amiga
or Unix is fine.  I prefer that it not output postscript, but if that
is what you have, please mail me anyway.

I am also interested in any information anyone has on the specifics to
this code, and what it means.  I have spoke with a postal employee and
he has told me that the NEW codes to be fazed in by 1995 will make
use of an 11 digit zip code that is unique to every building.

5 digit zip + `+4 zone` + last 2 digits of address

The last two digits are supposed to be a bit longer than the normal
length lines.  If anyone has any info on this it would be greatly
appreciated.

Does a patent really prohibit even private use of a device that relies
upon the patented principle in US? So, if someone has patented for
example a clever, but simple, part in your car, and that part breaks,
you may not (in principle of course, nobody would take this that
seriously) make a single copy of the part for use as a spare?

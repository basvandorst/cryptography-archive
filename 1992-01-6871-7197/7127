If you generate an RSA key or a NIST DSA key for yourself, you can check
without much trouble that it isn't vulnerable to any ``trick'' attacks,
and it is extraordinarily unlikely that you will randomly hit upon a key
which falls into any of the possible trapdoors. On the other hand, if an
outside organization generates a key for you, it could easily introduce
(e.g.) a trapdoor based on the number field sieve---e.g., RSA Inc. could
generate RSA keys which had no obvious weaknesses but could be broken in
a few months without much computing power. I am not so confident as
others seem to be that this can be detected; in fact, I'm reasonably
confident that it cannot. I would never trust an outside agency to
generate keys for me.

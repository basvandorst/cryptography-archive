I don't know any of the details, but the patent could well explain their
code scheme without revealing (for example) which specific key they use
to encode their information.  On the other hand, it's hard to see what
the legal basis of their suit is (other than "we can bankrupt you with
a baseless suit, neener neener neener"); if someone discovers a trade
secret without breaking a nondisclosure agreement, the owner of the
trade secret is out of luck.  I certainly don't remember signing a NDA
when I subscribed to TV Guide...

Once again, it looks like it's time to "kill all the lawyers."

This is not true.  Secrets ARE legally protected, especially in the 
Federal Government.  Industrial Secrets are Also protected by Law.

How can secrets ONLY be protected from insiders selling them to outsiders
as you claim here?

If an unauthorized person "somehow" aquires access to secret information,
that is legally espionage, and is a federal crime.

IDEAS are where the shades of legality falter.  If two people who are 
physically isolated from each other come up with the same IDEA at the 
same (or very concurrent) times, the one who makes it to the patent office
(and wades thru the legal BS) first becomes the legal OWNER of the idea,
the second person is stuck with an idea he can't use.

There most certainly IS moral protection, but it's a question of self-
regulation.  You should MORALLY be opposed to stealing someone else's 
work by ANY means, reverse engineering inclusive, however, man being the
crafty and impish creature that he is, tends to look at such moral issues
as good, "but not while my curiosity is aroused..." So, most average men
(and women) in the S/W Engineering - Mathematics fields are swayed by the
challenge of breaking the secret, instead of pondering the morality of
the situation.  (I should say hackers, not generalize the whole higher-math
professional realm...)

I agree with this statement to the extent the reverse-engineering is strickly anacedemic exercise, and has not MONETARY repurcussions.

I don't see how this could be true.  The expense of "key locking" every
VCR+ box would make the device beyond consumer-level interest.  This is
supposed to be a device for the masses, and the only way to do that is to make 
it available at a price the consumer public won't even sneeze at.  (29.99
where I live).

If Genstar(?) were TRUELY smart, they'd sell the encryption routine outright
with "niusance-fee" Liscences, and get every manufacturer of remote-control
technology to adopt their standard.  Then they could get royalties for every 
remote made, not just for the boxes they sell.

Who actually owns the codes?  TV Guide?  Genstar?  The Network?  and
really, what good is working out the code generation system?  It's only
value is in "robotic video control" or taping shows for you when you're too
lazy or don't know HOW to program your vcr yourself.  ("you" = generic
population for this statement).

I have a problem understanding the purpose of this debate... The use of 
the VCR+ device is merely to simplify a task that intimidates millions
of ordinary Americans.  The elimination of "programming the VCR".  What
possible benefit to society is "breaking" the algorithm that it uses
as a means of accomplishing the task?  

I used to play "Role Playing Games" in teh Navy, and had an HP Scientific
Programmable Calculator.  I programmed it to create "characters" for my
games, using the "random number generator" function.  However, the 
random generator (psuedo-random) needed a "seed" number to initialize
the sequence.  I learned that if I used the same number for a seed, I 
would ALWAYS get the same sequence of numbers out of the program, so I 
was then able to use "ID" numbers for my characters that would allow
me to re-create the character's initial statistics every time effortlessly.

This is the same idea as the VCR+... it creates a series of numbers 
corresponding to date, time, and channel, and length of recording.  So what?

Anything can be patented, as long as you can prove no one HOLDS a patent.
OR prove that your idea is sufficiently unique as to warrent federal
protection from infringement.

What, by allowing the masses easy access to the keys to their car?
Having keys does not automatically mean that you own the rights to 
every component of the car.  You can't claim that you invented the  
the car by building one from pieces you found on the street or in a
junck yard.  Trade Secrets are not the end product.

By listing the ingredients on a bottle of coke, can you decypher the
recipe?  Thousands have tried, but the SECRET remains.

How can you say this?  Copyright protection ONLY Prevents the other person
in the cafe from claiming that HE HAS WRITTEN the poem.  
There is no law to prevent him from reading aloud AS LONG AS HE MAKES NO
PROFIT OR MAKES NO CLAIMS TO OWN THE WORK.

As most say, my opinions are mine, and no one elses.

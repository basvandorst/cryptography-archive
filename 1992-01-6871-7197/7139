In 1968 and 1969, Zierler and Brillhart published a list of primitive
and irreducible trinomials over GF(2).  They did not have
factorizations of 2^N-1 for large N, consequently they did not know if
many of the irreducible trinomials are primitve.  Has this list been
updated?  Are there lists of primitive trinomials (polynomials) of
large degree (>150)?

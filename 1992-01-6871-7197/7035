I believe the following two things:
  (1) By law, RSADSI can sue to maintain its monopoly.
  (2) It is really unfortunate and harmful that they choose to do so.

I had a chat with Jim Bidzos last year.  He basically said, hey, we're
a good operation, so if you need software come get it from us.  And
since it's possible for them to enforce this suggestion by law, they do
so.  It's the American way, right?

But I will not personally excuse harmful and selfish behavior because it's
legal and normal in the business world.  RSADSI has done a lot of harm
in preventing Internetters from using public key technology, in exchange
for possibly nonexistent gains to itself.  Shame on you, Jim!

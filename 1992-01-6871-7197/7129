I know that in ordinary public key encryption the encryption
key is published, and it is difficult to deduce the decryption key
(the problem is equivalent to factoring a large prime number, I
believe).

Question: is the reverse also true?  That is, if I have a
decryption key only, is it difficult to deduce the encryption key
that goes with it?

Please email replies as I don't normally read this group.
If the answer is more involved than a 1-paragraph explanation maybe
someone could refer me to a good textbook or paper?

thanks in advance,
spencer

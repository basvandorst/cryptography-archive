You are mistaken about the need to publish in order to retain
copyright.  This is a common misconception, as the claim to
a Copyright does not require publication, nor does it invalidate
Trade Secret protection.

For example:

/* Copyright (c) 1984 AT&T */
/*   All Rights Reserved   */

/* THIS IS UNPUBLISHED PROPRIETARY SOURCE CODE OF AT&T   */
/* The copyright notice above does not evidence any      */
/* actual or intended publication of such source code.   */


Patent Protection *does* require complete disclosure of the methods,
and was designed to do so -- to promote industry and innovation by
providing an economic incentive, while disseminating the methods,
designs, etc.  and thereby advancing the state of the art.

Trademark protection may apply to the codes in the context of their
intended use -- this would prevent anyone not a licensee of Gemstar
from publishing the codes in an alternative to TV Guide, even without
directly stating that these codes are for the VCR+.

Mostly, I am amazed at the level of ignorance in this discussion, and
the mistaken impression that our own careful reasoning (even if it
seems correct to us) carries any legal weight.

I'm testing a DES program and comparing the results to a couple of those I
found on anonymous FTP servers.  The problem is that the programs I got from
FTP both produce different results themselves.  That's where I need some help
from the people who read this newsgroup.
If you'd like to give me a little hand, here's what you can do:  Send me a
message via E-mail and then send the EXACT same message using the DES method.
Use "lance" (w/o quotes) as the key, please.
Thanks in advance for all those who send me E-mail.

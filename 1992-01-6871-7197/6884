Men and women have been profiting from their secrets for all of known
history.  Would someone please tell me what is wrong with that and
what is right about stealing them.  Giving away something stolen is
just as wrong as selling it.

May those of you who revel in this form of intellectual destruction oneday
find a secret you have worked for, wish to keep and profit from and may
it be taken from you as crassly.

BTW I somewhat admire the caution expressed by "one of the three" but you
seem not to respect their privacy at all, just the legality of it all.

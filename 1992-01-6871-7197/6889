	Knowing the encryption scheme for VCR+ would not benefit the
general public.  It probably wouldn't even benefit the news agencies
that must pay for it, since the cost of data-entry is shared.

	It would be easier for me to program my VCR than to enter the
same data into my computer so that I can punch the right number into a
VCR+-compatible device.  In fact, I save a step.

	The thing that makes VCR+ seem convenient is that we _think_
*we* don't have to enter the date/time/length data ourselves.  *THIS*
is the indirect service for which the news agencies are paying.  The
encryption is merely a device to prevent others from being able to do
it themselves so the VCR+ people can monopolize simple data entry.
It's a cunning, high-profit scheme but I think its time is up.  (N.P.I. :-)

	IMHO, the ideal way to combat this sort of nonsense is to
introduce a competing device which is *easy* to program in *plaintext*.

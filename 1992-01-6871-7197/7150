The impression I allwasy had with public key systems is that they could
delelope trust in the integrity of the keys by broadcasting them
through various channel not all of which are easy to compromise.

Publishing your public key in a mass market paper back, putting it on
yoru answering machine, taking out an ad in the NY Times wiht it etc.
If enough all match its unlikely that someone has altered your key
secretly.

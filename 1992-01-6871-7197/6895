Well Bob, the law provides a mechanism for protecting your investment. It's
called Patent and Trademark Law along with Copyright Law. These laws are
SUPPOSED to provide a tradeoff that is fair both to the inventor and to
the public, ie, you increase the public knowledge by telling me how you
do it and I'll give you exclusive rights to the device/process for a 
limited length of time. Trade secret status does not increase the public
knowledge and is not time limited, however, if the idea is not
protectable then it isn't worth anything. I have little to no sympathy
for anyone using trade secret status, it is an invitation for others to
join in if they can figure it out also, and it isn't stealing. Basically
when someone treats their idea as a trade secret they have proclaimed to
the world that something is doable, its in the public domain, and all you
have to do is figure it out. If you are willing to invest in the idea and
it actually has merit, then take the time to properly protect it, but don't
try to make reverse engineering into theft. A lot of trade secrets are
simply attempts to cover up theft or the fact that the implementation was
derived from public domain material.

The RSA public-key cryptosystem is patented.  Under law, they have every
right to institute legal proceedings against Phil if he distributes the
program.  The patent may or may not be valid, and issuance of it may
or may not have been good public policy.  But it was issued, and it would
take a lawsuit -- a very expensive lawsuit, I might add -- to get it
squashed.

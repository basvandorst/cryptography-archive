  Folks who work for the US Government should note that the US
Government reportedly owns certain rights to use the RSA patent(s)
without having to pay any royalty.  They should also note that there
is some discussion within the government on having a central
certifying agency for the government (e.g. the USPS is apparently
interested in doing this).  I would imagine that someone at NIST or
DARPA is probably more current on the status of PEM or RSA use within
the government.

  Before actually getting a certificate from RSADSI, government folks
should consult with their organisations legal office for advice.

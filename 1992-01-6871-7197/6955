Not true - you have an (as a patent holder) to defend your patent.
If you don't the other side can use what's called a "latches" defense.
Which means your patent rights aren't as strong as if you informed the
the infringer right away.  Now understand latches doesn't work in
all cases, it's really up to the judge.

A pending patent is all that worthless, as long as you have a patent
application into Washington and you think some one is infriging on
your pending patent you can ask the examiner/officer to speed up
the review process so you can prosecute.

This is what I don't understand, why not just let the information
come out in public - they will be covered by the patent laws anyways.

Please do, I'd love to hear their side of the story

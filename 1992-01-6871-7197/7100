More to the point, conventional ciphers are often attacked through their
key management -- or key re-use for lack of a way to secretly communicate
fresh, randomly chosen keys each message.  RSA gives a secure way to 
communicate those fresh keys with each message -- making the conventional
system stronger than it would otherwise have been.

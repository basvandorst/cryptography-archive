But there's also no reason that usernames (aka mailbox names) have to be
the same as login names. My netlogin system supports a login name space
entirely separate from the name space understood by getpwnam(). Finding
out usernames doesn't help an attacker find login names. Of course, a
sysadmin who doesn't care about security can easily make the login name
and username the same.

Followups to alt.security. This has nothing to do with sci.crypt.

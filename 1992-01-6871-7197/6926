Very simple.  If the copyright/trademark/patent laws don't protect their
right to collect royalties for this type of thing, then they will loose their
business.  That business is already grossing something like $50,000,000 a
year and that will be nothing compared to what they will be making if the VCR+
coding scheme becomes a world-wide standard.  Not bad for a 3 year old
company founded by a couple of engineers from TRW.

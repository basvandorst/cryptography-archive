Gads.

DES(k,p), restricted to a given k, is a one-to-one function from 8
byte vectors to 8 byte vectors.  So, apply DES_k to p, get c=DES_k(p).
Feed it p again, it'll produce c again.

Ho hum.

ECB feeds a stream of 8 byte vectors {p_0, p_1, ..., p_i, ...} and
produces {DES_k(p_0), DES_k(p_1}, ..., DES_k(p_i}, ...}.  If p_i =
p_j, you'll certainly get DES_k(p_i) = DES_k(p_j).  Big surprise.

For a cryptosystem that isn't one-to-one, look at the Goldwasser and
Micali paper:

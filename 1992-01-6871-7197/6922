Does anyone know for fact what sort of Intellectual Property GemStar
has on the VCR+?  I heard/read somewhere that they have a patent
on the encoding scheme.  Can someone confirm this?

If the encoding scheme can be patented, it would make sense to patent 
it as some one  will come along and clone their device.  Wonder what
they (Gemstar) could do to some one that cloned (by reverse engineering)
their device and came out with something less expensive.

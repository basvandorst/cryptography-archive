In 1968 and 1969, Zierler and Brillhart published two articles where they 
listed irreducible and primitve trinomials (over GF(2)) for many values.  
For many degrees they did not know if the irreducible polynomials are primitive.
Does anyone know if this table has been updated since its publication?  Are 
there tables of large degree (>150) primitive trinomials (polynomials)?  Thanks.

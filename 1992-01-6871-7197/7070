I agree entirely. NIST DSA, with 1024 bits, would be much more secure
than any key that RSA Inc. has sold. With 512 bits it may have more or
less security, depending on all sorts of non-mathematical factors like
what the latest cute implementation speedup is.

sci.crypt readers should be aware that the number field sieve has had a
history of one significant new idea after another, beginning with
Pollard's discovery of the algorithm in 1988 and continuing through the
present. Any negative comments you hear on its performance are quite
likely to be out of date before they've been said.

I request that, for the present, you do not distribute anything connected
with me with respect to the PlusCode numbering system.  I should also point
out that Gemstar apparently reads the net, Gemstar has every intention of
vigorously protecting its property rights, and Gemstar may consider anyone
involved in distribution of this information to have potential liability.

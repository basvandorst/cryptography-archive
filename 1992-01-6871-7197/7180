Depends.  If the one-time key is as long as the plaintext, there is no
security enhancement obtained by 'strong' cryptographic methods
(assuming, of course, that the key is securely held by sender and
recipient).  If it's shorter, simple XOR leads to problems, due to the
ease of determining key length...

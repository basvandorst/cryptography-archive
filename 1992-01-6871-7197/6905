If someone sees this, please respond.  It seems to be appearing locally,
but I get bounce messages.

I am redirecting the reply back to sci.crypt, as misc.legal is certainly
not the correct group.  I am, however, broadening it to include
misc.int-property.

If they had any sense at all, they would also have a true universal VCR
programmer on their box, so that you could enter part of a program which
they have coded, or, at least, allow the user to enter the first or last
hour of a two-hour program.  But, I digress....

It seems clear that copyright protects only the individual codes published
in (say) TV Guide, not the coding algorithm.  I don't think the coding
table could be copyrighted unless it were published (all 10^8 codes?).  The
specific device (hardware + software) that generates the code may be
copyrighted, but it seems unlikely, because it would then have to be
published.  A reverse-engineered algorithm would not be covered, unless the
algorithm is patented, or an actually signed license agreement prohibits
reverse engineering.

Trademark protection probably prevents anyone from using their name for the
code (which is not VCR+) without permission, but saying
(name-of-device)-compatible would again not be covered.

Now, as for patents, I don't know.  I wouldn't think the method could be
patented, and it certainly has NO moral basis for restriction, but
legalities here are wierd.

If Genstar's (or Gemstar, or whatever their name is) will comment here, we
will know what they claim is covered.

They certainly HAVEN'T done that.

That may apply, but it is unclear.  Besides, we could then read (but not
implement) the algorithm, which is what most of the people here
(sci.crypt) are interested in.

I doubt that the codes themselves could be trademarked -- Digital Equipment
Corparation claimed a trademark on the term BYTE, and Intel on '386, but I
don't think they could possibly hold up in court.

I don't see how this could apply at all.

I have heard that Gemstar will explain their legal justification shortly. 
I am willing to wait to see if there is possible basis, but I doubt there
is.

The consensus among cognoscenti in the UK at present is that the
standard 512 bit keys used with vanilla RSA implementations give maybe
ten years cover time.

Given one significant improvement in algorithms and, depending on the
nature of that improvement, either one or two generations of new
hardware, 512 bit numbers should be capable of factorisation; perhaps
not routinely, but with a high enough probability to rule out theie use
in applications where a large security parameter is specified. Opinion
therefore tends to suggest the use of 1000 bit keys. 

This is one motive not to use vanilla RSA but second generation schemes
such as NIST DSA. Some of these schemes have the property that the
computational overhead does not increase all that much going from 512 to
1024 bit implementation.

In any case it will be interesting to watch developments.

   I'm sure many of the math wizards out there already realize that
   the VCR+ people missed the boat significantly in their design.
   Besides the fact that they did not significantly encrypt their
   numbers they also limited themselves to only base ten 
   representation.  If they had just added a few more keys to 
   their device they could have used base 16 or base 32 and had
   a much denser information representation.  I've recently designed
   a similar algorithem (using an arithmetic compression model)
   for use in generating codes for canned food production.

   Frankly there is no trick to it (VCR+) but, quite a bit of marketing.
   And there are lots of existing applications that already use some
   form of information packing methodology (And their method apperently
   uses a variant of a well know technique - huffman coding - , again
   not original. )

I would like to appologize to Curt and the others for the absolutely
inappropriate use of the word theft.  They stole nothing.  They figured
it out or reverse engineered it as we call that kind of work in my
profession.

Doing this kind of thing has also been going on for recorded history and
there is nothing wrong with it.  What I was objecting to without thinking
it through very well was the public dissemination of the information
in a frivilous fashion that would accomplish nothing but to harm the
engineers and programmers that worked hard to develop it.  If you want
to use your hard work to compete, by all means do so but I must object
to the pointlessness of potentially ruining a business simply for the
sake of ego.  Use your obvious talents to invent something new.

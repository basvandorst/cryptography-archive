[bar code stuff]
   For the specs you need for printing barcodes inside the address
   block (not along the bottom of the envelope) contact the USPS
   representative who covers your area and ask for publication:
   "BARCODE UPDATE".  This booklet, dated September 1991, has no
   part number, so you have to ask for it by name.

  FYI, there's a nice article on postal hacking, including bar coding
stuff, in the latest issue of 2600 (a magazine mostly devoted to illicit
stuff.)

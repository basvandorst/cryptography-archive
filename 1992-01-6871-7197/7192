	Exactly what provisions ARE there for recovery of plaintext if an encryption key is lost? Correct me if I'am wrong, but the point of encrypting data is that the plain text can't be recovered with out the key. Either their software hides the key in the encrypted text, or there encryption method is reversable. Neither of these traits are desireable.
But then again, maybe Dolphin knows something I don't.

This boils down to a chosen-plaintext attack. There was a posting a
while back which elegantly proved that if you plug in the message that
corresponds to the number "2", you can easily derive the private key.
The security relies on the fact that you don't encrypt stuff for other
people. Unfortunately, I've lost the reference; it should be
relatively easy to recreate though.

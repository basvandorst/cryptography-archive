It works this way:  When you encrypt data you have the recoverability
option set either to ON or to OFF.  If it is ON then if the encryption key
subsequently is lost or is unavailable then the data can be recovered by
a special and lengthy procedure which is known only to the publisher of the
software.  If the recoverability option was OFF at the time the data was
encrypted then if the encryption key is lost then there is no way (other
than investing trillions of dollars and millions of years of computer time)
to recover the data.  Thus for absolute security, simply encrypt with the
recoverability option OFF.  If concerned about losing the key, encrypt with
it ON.

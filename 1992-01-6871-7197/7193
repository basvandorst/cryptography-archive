Dear sci.crypt members

I am an semi-frequent reader of this newsgroup.  Being a programmer I decided
to create an encryption algorythm and would like you to test it out.  If any
are willing to try it send a mail message to the address below.

The Challenge: I will give the program to you.  It encodes and decodes.  Your
mission(;->) is to try and figure out how the encryption method goes.  If there
are any who can determine how it works, I will post their name to the group in
the order of who got it first.  Kind of a game to see who, if any of you, will
be the first to solve it.

Good luck!

P.S. I would appreciate feedback on this program/algorythm.  Any mail/questions
are welcome.  (Of course, if this scheme were to be used the encode and decode
would be in separate programs.)

Hope to hear from ALL of you.

thanx

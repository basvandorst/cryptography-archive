I should hope any such standard would take into account how much is at
stake and what the state of the art is.  But that issue is different,
and orthogonal from the algorithm we use to generate the signature of
whatever length.  It only points out how much we need the algorithm to
be able to accomodate a variety of lengths.

My point is that it is better to have an algorithm that generates a
short signature, so you can specify the level of security needed with
fine granularity.

Well, if the original algorithm was a filter, then you checkpoint it
just before it reads the EOF, then repeatedly { feed it the EOF, get
four bytes of signature out, restart from the checkpoint, feed it the
four bytes, and recheckpoint }.

But it's true this is a fairly lame way of extracting the large amount
of internal state from the algorithm, if it has it.  And if the state
is not large, this scheme does not buy extra security.

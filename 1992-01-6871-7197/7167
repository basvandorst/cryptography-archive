Yep- being able to decrypt files without the key is the hallmark of a good
cryptosystem.

Dolphin may be right, the business world does not really want all the hassles
that come with security.  They want to stop the lazy and stupid from breaking
their files.  They want the appearance of security and the deniability of
"I took precautions by buying a commercial encryption product- so it can't be
my fault that somebody stole our data."  But even so Dolphin comes off like a 
bunch of idiots bragging about their shit-ware to sci.crypt- without releasing
*ANY* details at all, so if you really care about privacy don't buy from:

Actually I take that back, I hope some poor shmuck buys their "better than DES"
software, loses some really valuable data and then proves Dolphin negligent
and sues their tushes off ("this software is no way warranted ..." disclaimers
or not worth the paper they are printed on).

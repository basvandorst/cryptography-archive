Dan is absolutely correct.  The *purpose* of a patent is to spread the
knowledge; more or less by definition, attempts to restrict
distribution of the patent would nullify the intent.  Put another way,
a patent represents a contract between you and the government.  In
exchange for disclosing all you know about a new, useful, and
non-obvious invention, you are granted a limited-term monopoly on using
it.  As part of that, patents are explicitly *not* covered by copyright
protection.  And even if they were, copyright protects the expression
of ideas, not the ideas themselves.  If and when VCR+ is patented, it
is absolutely legal to publish anything about it that came from the
patent application.  However, *using* the knowledge to build a
compatible unit is infringement.

That said, it's quite likely that the text of the patent will not
provide enough information to allow one to decode the published
values.  If nothing else, there's the distinction between a
cryptographic algorithm and the keys used.  VCR+ apparently uses some
internal tables; while the rules for generating the tables may be in
the patent, I doubt that the exact values would be.

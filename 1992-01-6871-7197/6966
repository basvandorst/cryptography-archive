   IMHO, the ideal way to combat this sort of nonsense is to
   introduce a competing device which is *easy* to program in *plaintext*.

There is more to VCR+ than this.

If you live in an area like the NYC metro, there are a half a dozen
different cable systems, each with different channel number
allocations.  You set this up in VCR+ when you install it.  Now, when
you want to record something on HBO/DIS/CNBC/etc., you just enter the
code from the newspaper listing (which lists channels by name, not
number), and VCR+ knows the channel number, in addition to the
time/length of the program.

This is especially useful if you want to record something on a channel
you watch (and/or record) infrequently.

Even if you were to design a device that did this in plaintext, I
can't see how the interface would be anything but annoying and error
prone.

On-screen programming sucks!  Open the doors on the TV, turn on the TV,
switch the video on the receive to TV, turn on the VCR, find the VCR
remote, find the right menu.  I liked the old non-on-screen programming
much better.  Sadly, it is hard to get a VCR without only on-screen
programming.  And this assumes that I am not using the TV for something
that I don't want to interrupt.

When this is taken into account, VCR+ is *much* faster to use.  This can
be quite useful when you realize at 8:30 that you really need a serial
port switch, and that you have to leave right away to get one before the
store closes, and that you won't be back in time for "Cheers."  A quick
glance at the paper, and a few keystrokes, and you are covered.

Another area where the VCR+ is helpful is when you have to leave during
a show.  If you start to watch something, and then have to leave for
some reason, you can enter the code for that program, and the thing
is smart enough to realize that the show has already started.  It then
starts the recording.  A lot of VCRs would get this wrong.

Most VCRs only have 8 or fewer events.  The VCR+ has 14.

And then there are the obvious reasons, like cable boxes and playing
jokes on your friends.

The most popular password cracker is a little more sophisticated than this.
It also checks words spelled backwards and small 4 letter words doubled
(such as fourfour) as well as appending a number to the end of each word
(four1, four2, four3) and checking words all capitalized, and all lower case
and first letter capitalized.  It also has it's own language so you can
create your own permutations.  Also if it is publicized that people don't
use verbs as passwords, so nobody checks them, people will start using them
and they're already checking them.  If you don't want to bog down your
mainframe I suggest you do what most crackers are likely to do, download
/etc/passwd and run the long version of the crack program on it (downloadable
from many ftp sites).

This is a good start, 

		- Avoid any personal information (name, birthdate, kids names)
		- Avoid anything that is already in a file in your area.
                  (fantasy or science fiction characters are nice, but
		   if someone guesses that you're a Heinlein fan from
		   other files in your area, they have a good headstart
		   at guessing your password.)
		- Avoid simple substitutions of letters for numbers like
		  zero for oh, or one for el.  These are among the first
		  things tried.
		- Also avoid computer jargon like "qwerty".

I have a problem with people who claim to enhance my security by designing
better lock picks.  I would rather they spent their time designing better
locks.

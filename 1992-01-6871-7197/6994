False. A patent which has been applied commercially is stronger than a
so-called ``paper patent,'' but a patent, unlike a copyright, *never*
gets weaker. You can ignore it for 15 years and then sue someone, and
your suit will be just as strong as if you had sued him immediately.

Say what? Are you speaking from experience? I've never heard of such a
thing. There are dozens of ways to slow down a patent application
process (witness the Hyatt patent) but no way that I know to speed it
up.

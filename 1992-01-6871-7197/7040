In October 1991 Thinking Machines in Massachusetts unveiled a supercomputer
capable of 1,000,000,000,000 operations per second.  If we make the
rough, but not unreasonable, assumption that for each DES key 10,000
operations are required to encrypt 256 spaces and to store the resulting
eight byte values then this supercomputer can generate 100,000,000 entries
in our table per second.  Thus 7.2 x 10^16 / 10^8 seconds would be required
to construct the whole table, which is approximately 22.82 years.  With
improvements in computer speed and architecture, by the year 2000 this time
might well be decreased by an order of magnitude, allowing such a table to
be constructed in 2 or 3 years.

====================================================================
This configuration of the CM-5 would cost over $500,000,000.  Also,
I believe it is technically possible to make it that fast, but the
specific plans haven't been drawn up as to how such a beast would be
put together..

======================
This is my belief from what I have read and heard, not an official remark
from M.S.C.

You have merely added yourself to the computer system -- as a very low
speed, error-prone disk.  Enemy techniques for probing your system can
work even if you're present in the loop -- so you can't get rid of the
assumption.


Now, if you did the entire algorithm inside your own head and spoke only
ciphertext, they'd have to develop mind-reading equipment to crack your
system.....

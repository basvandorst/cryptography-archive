I disagree. There are many stupid users out there, and they undoubtedly
*will* believe the claims made by Dolphin Software, and *will* feel
safer knowing something which happens to be false but which nevertheless
is a comforting thing to know. So I'm forced to agree with Peter.

That does leave one minor problem, namely that the thing which users
feel safe knowing is, as was noted above, false. Hiding an encryption
algorithm which is subsequently published as object code is like turning
out the lights on a bat. History also shows that the conditional
probability of a proprietary encryption algorithm being weak is much,
much higher than the conditional probability of a published algorithm
being weak; and in this case, given the idiocy of some of Dolphin
Software's published statements about DES, I'd be surprised if any
undergraduate with a disassembler couldn't break their encryption scheme
in a few hours work. But users *will* feel safe. Trust me.

What???  4 byte signature- that is only 2^(4*8) = 4294967296 values.  Assuming
it only takes about a thousand instructions to check a signature a 10 MIPS 
machine (workstation class) could check all possible values in 429497 seconds 
or 5 days.  Anybody in a University environment (where lots of idle 
workstations are available) could easily forge these signatures in a few 
hours.  So unless your application changes authentication keys every couple
of hours it can be spoofed.

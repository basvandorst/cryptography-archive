OK. I've tried to stay out of this discussion, but I can't stand to see
misinformation posted.

Essentially, Kevin is right and Dan is wrong. State of the art in factoring
and in computing discrete logs is such that for numbers in the 300 to 600
bit range, one can solve a discrete log problem with n-30 bits in about the
same time one can factor an n-bit number.  This is by direct measurement.
That is to say, factoring is ** slightly ** easier. However, one should
note that these estimates are implementation dependent.


Forget the asymptotics. We [Odlyzko & LaMachia,  Lenstra & Manasse, & myself]
have direct experience with these methods.

You're right about that...

And wrong about that... unless you never make use of the information in
a way that damages Genstar.

If Genstar had any sense at all, they are perfectly capable of
preventing you or I from selling codes that work with their remote to
TV Guide or anyone else.

We don't know what kind of protection or claims have been made by
Genstar.  They *may* actually have a combination of patent and
copyright protection on the code itself, the method of generating it,
etc.  They may also have trademark protection on the published codes.

Take note:  Copyright law in the U.S. has changed recently.  We not
only finally signed the Bern Convention, but protection has been
extended *beyond* the particular manner of expression to the actual
content, in some recent cases.

The way to protect a secret is to keep it a secret.  Patent protection
gives you exclusive license for a limited time in exchange for making
public your method/device/concept.  Trademark protection gives you
license to use a name, logo, identity or specification (which may
include Genstar's codes).  Copyright protection protects the poet
from having his work read aloud by another in a cafe, but not in
a classroom.

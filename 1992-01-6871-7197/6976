Of course, it isn't a secret -- if a patent has been granted, it
is easy to check.

Absolutely not true.  If and when a patent is granted, protection
is extended from the date the patent application is filed.

No. What's public knowledge is what is contained in the patent
as it is published.  If your posting is used by someone who infringes
a patent, you may be liable.

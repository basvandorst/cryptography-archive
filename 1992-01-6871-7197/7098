It is not ergonomically practical to use pure RSA with large keys to
encrypt and decrypt long messages.  Absolutely no one does it that way
in the real world.  But perhaps you are concerned that the whole
package is weakened if we use a hybrid public-key and conventional
scheme just to speed things up.  After all, a chain is only as strong
as its weakest link.  Many lay people mistakenly believe that RSA is
intrinsically stronger than any conventional cipher.  It's not.  RSA
can be made weak by using weak keys, and conventional ciphers can be
made strong by choosing good algorithms.  It's usually difficult to
tell exactly how strong a good conventional cipher is, without
actually cracking it.  A really good conventional cipher might
possibly be harder to crack than even a "military grade" RSA key.  
The attraction of public key cryptography is not because it is
intrinsically stronger than a conventional cipher-- its appeal is
because it helps you manage keys more conveniently.

What are these changes?  

Have the following broad distinctions been altered?

  If you have a patent:

		nobody else can use your invention (for the application
		you patented it for) -- even if they invent it independently

  If you have a copyright:

		nobody can COPY your works -- but if someone rewrites 
		(reinvents) it independently, that is ok

  If you have a trade secret:

		you have no protection against anyone either copying or
		reinventing your secret 


(I don't see how trademark fits into the discussion.)

Now if copyright has not fundamentally changed, if you write a program  
and copyright it, I can independently write a program that does the
same thing (or even by chance it happens to be the same program) and use it.

Am I outdated? plain wrong?             thanks, strick <strick@osc.com>

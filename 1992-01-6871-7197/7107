Recently there has been a new class of random sequence generators invented
with ridiculously long periods and apparantly excellent randomness.  It is
fast, involving fairly simple arithmetic and real big state variables
which could be used as keys.  The reference is:

Marsaglia, Zaman, and Tsang.  "Toward a Universal Random Number Genderator."
Statistics & Probability Letters 8 (1990) 35-39. North Holland (Elsevier)

I would appreciate any comment or analysis by professionals in the field
of cryptography regarding the use of these sequences to xor with plain
text to encrypt before I spend any time implementing it.

Why don't we all put RSA keys in our signature, whether we intend to use
the RSA system or not.  If someone will tell me what a RSA key looks like,
I'll put one in my .signature.

If lots of people do it, it will be impossible separate the wolves from the
sheep.  You don't have to answer every encrypted message, just those from
people you know and trust.

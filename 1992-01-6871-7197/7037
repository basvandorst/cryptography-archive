   Another area where the VCR+ is helpful is when you have to leave during
   a show.  If you start to watch something, and then have to leave for
   some reason, you can enter the code for that program, and the thing
   is smart enough to realize that the show has already started.  It then
   starts the recording.  A lot of VCRs would get this wrong.

Otto J. Makela askes:
   What's wrong with just pressing "record" on your VCR ?

It doesn't stop when the show ends.  I view tapes as random access block
devices rather than sequential access devices[*], and thus often have tapes
where there is logically free space (i.e., watched shows) interspersed with
space that is used (i.e., shows that have been taped but not yet
watched).

Hence, just pressing record and leaving might run accross block boundaries
if I don't return in time to stop it, corrupting my file system.

[*] This is not as silly as it sounds.  The amount of time a computer waits
for a disk to seek, relative to how fast the computer operates, is comparable
to the amount of time a human waits for a VCR to seek, relative to how
fast a human does things.  Hence, viewing VCR tapes as block devices is not
unreasonable.  Laserdiscs are like core memory...

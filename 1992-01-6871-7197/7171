The Twelfth Annual CRYPTO Conference, sponsored by the International
Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR), in cooperation with the
IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee  on  Security and Privacy, 
the  Computer Science Department  of  the  University of California, 
Santa Barbara, and the Department of Computer Science \& Engineering 
of the University of Nebraska, Lincoln will be held on the campus of 
the  University of California,  Santa Barbara, on August 16-20, 1992. 
Original research papers and technical expository talks are solicited 
on all practical and theoretical aspects of cryptology.  It is antici-
pated that some talks may also be presented by special invitation of 
the Program Committee.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR AUTHORS:

Authors  are requested to send 12 copies of a detailed abstract (not a 
full paper) by April 27, 1992,  to  the  Program Chair at the address 
given below. Submissions must arrive on time or be postmarked no later 
than April 22, 1992 and sent by airmail in order to receive considera-
tion  by  the Program Committee. It is required that submissions start 
with a succinct statement of the problem addressed, the solution propo-
sed, and  its significance to cryptology, appropriate for a non-speci-
alist reader.  Technical development directed to the specialist should 
follow as needed.

Abstracts  that  have  been  submitted  to other conferences that have 
proceedings are NOT eligible for submission to Crypto.


Crypto SUBMISIONS MUST BE ANONYMOUS.  This means that names and affilia-
tions of authors should only appear on the title page of the submission; 
it should be possible to remove this page and send the papers to Program 
Committee members. A Latex style file that produces output in this format 
is available by email from the Program Chair. A limit of 10 pages of 12pt 
type (not counting the bibliography or the title page) is placed on all 
submissions.

Authors will be informed of acceptance or rejection in a letter mailed 
on or before June 17, 1992.  A compilation of all accepted abstracts will 
be available at the conference.  Authors of accepted abstracts will be 
given until July 20, 1992 to submit revised versions for this compilation.  
Complete conference proceedings will be published in Springer-Verlag's 
Lecture Notes in Computer Science series at a later date.

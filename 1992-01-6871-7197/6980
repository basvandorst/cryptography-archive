}Wrong.  According to "Patent it yourself": "Many people believe that a person

}infringement.  This isn't true.  You have no monopoly or rights until
}your patent actually issues.  In other words, a manufactured article covered
}by a pending patent application can be freely copied by anyone."

I think this is true, but: I was under the impression that when a
patent is awarded, the 'monopoly' is _retroactive_ to the date of the
original application.  If this is not true, by all means let me/us
know.  ON the other hand, if it _is_ true, then inventions that are
"patent pending" are in a funny situation: yes, you can copy the
invention (since it is not _yet_ protected), BUT what must you do
[and/or "what happens to you"] when the patent eventually gets issued
and you find that you have been infringing for the previous couple of
years?

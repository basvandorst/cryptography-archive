Ah, I think maybe I've misled you a little.  Firstly, my DES code is
optimised-to-the-hilt 386 assembler, and uses big lookup tables.  It's
possible that you could also do a big table lookup with FEAL-32 but I
haven't tried.  My FEAL code uses no lookup tables at all, so its
speed*space performance is much better than DES.  It will also run
quickly on small microprocessors, which DES won't do - fast DES needs
lots of 32-bit table lookups.

Also, FEAL has a somewhat larger key (64 rather than 56 bits) than
DES, which is an advantage in some cases.

Let me stress that, AFAIK, *nobody* can break FEAL-8 in CBC mode by
using any method.

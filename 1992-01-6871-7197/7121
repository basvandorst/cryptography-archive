	I don't mean to be either rude or overly paranoid, but without seeing the actual source code, how could a user know that the program is really secure? I'd never accuse anyone of wrong doing, but it is possible for an encryption program to have a back door and to hide a copy of the key in the encrypted text. Since there is some degree of data compression, a key hidden in the data file would be hard to detect. Well, any comments to still my irrational fears?

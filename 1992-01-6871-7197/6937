	From a utilitarian standpoint, the only purpose of copyright,
patent and trade secret laws is to provide the minimum economic
incentive necessary in order to cause a particular creation to be
produced or publicized (factoring some allowance for risk, but not
so much as to encourage the development of products that aren't
worth producing).

	I believe that, at $50 million per year, the VCR+ people
have collected more than the minimum incentive which would have
sufficed to make at least one person decide to pursue the venture
given the that the initial investment was probably less than the
initial investment for other $50million/year companies and given
that the chance of failure was probably no worse.  This is not to
say that it is evil for the VCR+ people to continue to sell their
services, but it is to say that nobody should feel any moral
obligation at this point to refrain from making the VCR+ algorithm
public knowledge.

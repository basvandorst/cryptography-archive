As I understand it, one advantage is that you can record from several
different cable chanels.

Here in Saint Paul, MN, we have to tune in our cable on the cable box,
which sends its output to the VCR, which sends its output to the TV.

Say you want to record PBS - channel 2 at 1900, and MTV - 40 at 2030.

You would have to put your cable box on channel 2, set a program for 1900,
and then get back home before 2030 to switch the cable box to chanel 40
manually.  Granted, this is a stupid way to run a cable company, but 
thats what you get when a company has a monopoly.  They don't have to
do things a convenient way.

I gather many cable companies are set up this way, and this is one of the
main things that makes VCR + sellable.  (That and the fact that 90% of
Americans are too stupid to even set the CLOCK on their VCR, much less
program it to do something at a certain time).

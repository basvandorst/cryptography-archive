	Ridiculous.  The entire point of having a signature is to prevent other  
people from forging your mail.  So someone else does a brute-force search and  
produces a four-byte key.  They can then send that out.  You can make your own  
signature as long as you like; that won't stop other people.
	What is needed is a standard length beyond which a signature is legal.   
Which amounts to legislating a length, which is the same problem there was with  
DES.
	Public-key signatures have major practical problems.

:Sure, but you could also just write your own algorithm.  Re-scanning the

:A good, secure hash algorithm should have a lot of internal state, preferably
:thousands of bits.  At the end, this gets smashed down into whatever the user
:asked for.  It's not much difference if he wants a 32-bit signature or a
:256-bit signature.  That's up to him.
	Same problem.  Your enemy posts a 32-bit signature and says, "I've  
decided not to worry about making long signatures."  You can have yours as long  
as you like, but it won't help you.

I'm not an attorney, but I do have a U.S. Patent and have applied for a
patent in Japan. In the U.S. the process is esentially secret until the
patent issues, accordingly no patent protection is available until the
patent issues because the public at large could not know they were
infringing the patent (there can't be any wilful intent). In Japan on the
other hand, the patent is thrown open for inspection by the public prior
to issuing letters of patent, as such, when the patent is granted, if it
is, then the protection goes back to the date it was thrown open, as the
public was able to ascertain whether they might be in violation of it. At
least in a nutshell, that is how the patent attorney's explained it to me
after considerable expense. I hope  I learned something after what it
cost.

Would anyone else care to post analysis programs they've found useful?
I don't (often) have access to a scanner that can read-in text, so it
would be really handy if I could get the source-code already typed in.
(DOS-box executables are also welcome, but better on alt.binaries.ibm.pc.)

BTW:  I'm glad I happened to be following sci.crypt when
Pretty Good (tm) Privacy was mentioned.  I've downloaded it,
and I like it.  I'll probably even *use* it.

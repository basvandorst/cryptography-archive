I *highly* doubt that publishing a public key would constitute sufficient
evidence of violation even *if* it was possible to determine that it was,
in fact, an RSA public encryption key and not a string of random
characters.

Perhaps some reader of the misc.legal.computing newsgroup can shed some
light on how well patents protect inventions, like cryptographic systems,
where the only "evidence" of wrong-doing is an untraceable document and/or
alleged public keys communicated between the two parties.

For example: jg67AjhghsaaA786alaJWIcYZ could be an encryption key for an
RSA derivative I've developed, couldn't it??

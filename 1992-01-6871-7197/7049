Does anyone out there know of any decryption programs for UNIX or for
the Macintosh? I have seen a good number of encryption programs for
the Macintosh but I'm interested in playing with some programs that
are capable of at least attempting to decode random letter sequences.
It doesn't have to be anything fancy: I'm thinking on the level of the
local newspaper's "Cryptoquip" or something like that. (A simple letter
substitution game; e=a, r=c, etc.) Any pointers to FTP archives that
maintain this sort of material or actual pd/shareware programs would
be greatly appreciated. Please e-mail responses as I don't read these
groups regularly. (This message has been cross-posted to
comp.sys.mac.apps and to sci.crypt.) Thanks in advance,

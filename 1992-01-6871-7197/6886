     I am looking for any pointers to information on the algorithms used
to verify credit cards (and similar authentication schemes).  For example,
I know that the last digit on most credit cards is typically a checksum.
What is this method actually called?  Is is a commercial standard?
Where can I find more about this?
     If there is enough response, I will post a summary for the group.

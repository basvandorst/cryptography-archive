Discussions of patents belong in the moderated group comp.patents. That
way sci.crypt can stick to cryptography. To answer your question: A
patent stops anyone from making, using, or selling the patented
invention. Now you might wonder what ``making RSA'' means---it would
seem that only someone who _uses_ RSA is infringing the patent. However,
in patent law there's a doctrine of contributory infringement: roughly,
anyone who contributes to infringement is liable. So someone who writes
an RSA implementation (or distributes it, or advertises it!) may be a
contributory infringer.

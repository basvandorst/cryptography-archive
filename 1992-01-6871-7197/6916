I don't get it.  When the VCR+ was first introduced, I thought it
was a great idea.  (of course, it doesn't work at _all_ like I
thought :-)  I waited for the Chicago Tribune to start printing
the codes, but they decided they are not going to.  So I did not
buy a VCR+.

I could switch to the other paper, or buy TV Guide or something,
but it's not that important.  If I had a PD program to generate
the codes, I might very well buy one of their boxes.  So what
exactly is their benefit in keeping tight reins on the algorithm?

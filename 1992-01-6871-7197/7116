For general information, Davies and Price [1] have a few things to say 
about ISO 8731/2 and other ISO standards.  I'll paraphrase it.

Amongst it's other work, Technical Committee 68 from ISO have done a 
bit of work on authentication algorithms.  TC68 have based their standards
on some of the X9 series from ANSI.  

ISO 8730 covers the logical procedure for message authentication
ISO 8731 Part 1 covers DES using ANSI X3.92 as a reference.
ISD 8731 Part 2 covers the Message Authentication Algorithm
ISO 8732 covers wholesale key management and is based on ANSI X9.17


Davies and Price also have some more to say about MAA.  Again, I will
paraphrase:

ISO used MAA rather than S.W.I.F.T and Data Seal because these are
both proprietry, unpublished systems.

Thus NPL (including one of either Davies or Price, I think Price)
designed MAA (ostensibly to fulfil a need expressed by the UK
banking organisations).  It is based on 32-bit arithmetic and was
designed to work fast on machines that can do 32-bit multiplication
quickly.  The design was "suggested by the DSA algorithm".

The book then describes the algorithm's calculation for each
iteration.  However, I will leave that bit out for now, just
in case some, kind person posts that 'C' source for MAA (hint, hint).
However, I will quote their (potentially less than objective)
summary of the algorithm for future reference.

"The MAA algorithm derives its strength from the difficulty of
analysis when calculations are carried out with a number of moduli. 
Not only are the multiplications with two diferent moduli, but
also arithmetic operations modulo 2^32 and the logocal operation XOR.
Also, the logical operations which generate the multipliers F and G
are non-linear, so that any arithmetic analysis is exceptionally
complex.  By deriving the six quantities from the key in a complex
manner any method of analysis which is capable of partly deriving
one of these values would be unlikely to give a clue to the others.
It is particularly important that the final blocks S and T which 
are appended the message for authenticator purposes are secrets
derived from the key values."

"The computation tim for the authenticator values is proportional to
the message size except for the small addition of blocks S and T.  
This makes it practicable to use the algorithm on short messages
as well as on long files.  For very long messages the standard
specifies a special mode of operation."

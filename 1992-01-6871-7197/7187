	I'am curious, what kind of provision IS there for recovery of plain text if the key is lost? I can only think of two, and neither of them thrill me. The first is that the key is hidden in the encrypted file. The second is that the Dolphin encryption process is reversable. I beleive that not having access to the plain text without the key is the reason encryption programs were invented. But then again, maybe Dolphin knows something that I don't.

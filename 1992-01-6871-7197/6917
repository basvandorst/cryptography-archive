It is called a VCR. I don't understand the problem with programming
any VCR that has reasonable on-screen programming. For the run-of-the-mill
RCA VCR that I have, I just psuh the program button, it then prompts
me for the channel, start time, stop time, and day. All in easy to 
understand form. It takes about twice as many key strokes as the
VCR+ code, but it is directly readable and does not require a special
"code book" to operate. 

The only advantage that I can see to the VCR+ device is that since
it is battery powered, it doesn't lose its programming during
power outages.

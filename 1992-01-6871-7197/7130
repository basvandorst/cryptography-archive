What I don't understand is: why *doesn't* RSA let us use public key on
the Internet? I would think that if they sold RSA software for Unix
and DOS on the mass-market for a reasonable price, they would make
a lot of money. Why don't I see an "RSA for DOS" box on the shelf
of my local computer store? Why don't they strike deals with the
hardware vendors to ship an SMTP daemon that can correctly deal with
mail with "RSA_public_key: xxxxxxx" header lines, in exchange for
a per-box fee?

I would start to think that they're not in this business to make money
(or if I was feeling paranoid, that someone was paying them to keep
the public-key stuff off the market)

I am a novice at this sort of thing, and don't have a very good background
in math, but could someone send me a description of what the des encryption
algorithm does? (in layman terms if possible) . 
I am also curious as to this: my boss showed me that in unix(HP-ux on a 9000 
series ) if you have a password then change your password to the same thing it used to be, the result is DIFFERENT than the original.( I assume that passwd uses
the des) I don't understand how it can be different and still be recouverable.

I am sorry if this seems very basic, but this really got my goat, so to speak.


thanks,
Tom Gilgan

Nope, no longer required.  Check with your USPS customer rep or
read the Domestic Mail Manual (where he/she gets the information
anyway) for the new Address Block coding requirements.  Briefly,
it's now possible to print the bar code so that it shows through
the window of a #10 envelope.

There's another code beyond that called ABC (Advanced Bar Code).
See the publication BARCODE UPDATE for easy-to-understand
details.  It's available from you USPS representative free of
charge.

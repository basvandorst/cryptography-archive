You seem to be assuming that all free encryption packages will be
no-frills.  I don't think that assumption is consistent with the state of
free (and inexpensive) software.  Some of the frilliest software around is
free; consider rn and nearly everything from the Free Software Foundation
(especially GNU Emacs).

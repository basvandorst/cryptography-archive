I know that this has been shown for GF(2) polynomial, or "linear" approaches
but has it been shown for the MZT algorithm.  I can't get a copy of the
damn paper so I can't speak to its "linear" nature.  I know however that
using second grade arithmetic does not necessasarily imply that a field
is linear if parts of that arithmetic are used in a non-linear fashion.

It was stated some time back that xor'ing a pseudo random sequence with
plain text was vulnerable regardless of the PRNG employed.  Please
elaborate.

I actually don't understand at all why the encoding scheme needs to be
secret. If its secrecy is all that protects the company, then there
seems to be little hope of being alone in the business for long.

Couldn't the whole system be public, so that the scheme (and the
controllers the company sells!) would be usable everywhere? Isn't
there a way to get some patent or whatever protection for instance for
the idea of controlling multiple devices with these clever codes that
would then be free for any paper to publish as their customer service?

I just wonder this secrecy, why not a free, easy to use coding scheme
and some (more reliable?) protection for the rights to produce devices
that use it?

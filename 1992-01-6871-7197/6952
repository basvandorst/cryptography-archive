Although sci.crypt is definitely the wrong newsgroup for this (unless
what I'm about to mention is encrypted :-) but what the heck...

A company by the name of Frox (who I believe designed the cases for the
Macintosh and the NeXT) has developed an integrated audio/visual system
which does what you say, and a lot more.  It uses the "Frox Wand" to
move a hand around the display, and it controls everything about the
Frox system - from the 100 disc CD changer (which lists the names of
the discs and the songs on the discs) to the on-screen TV guide grid.
If you want to record a program, you move the hand with the "Frox Wand"
to the show, click, and drag it down to the icon of the VCR.  That's
it; it's set to record.  It's a totally fantastic system from what I've
_read_.  The system attempts to be as digital as possible, delivering
digital signals all the way to the speakers, where each one has its own
DAC and amplifier.

From what I understand, the data for the "on-screen" TV guide (along
with movie reviews, stock quotes, music reviews, software upgrades,
etc.) are sent on unused scan lines on some Turner-owned station like
TNT or CNN through an agreement with Turner Broadcasting.  The Frox
system apparently has a receiver which decodes the data and converts
it... 

I don't know too much more, but I know Frox has an 800 number; if
you're interested maybe you can call and ask for a brochure.  (The
brochure shows the on-line TV guide and various other screen shots...)

Regards, 
Eddy

P.P.S. I have no affiliation with Frox or any other companies mentioned!

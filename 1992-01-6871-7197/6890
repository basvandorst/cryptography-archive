(1)  This is the wrong group for this post.

(2)  THERE IS NO LEGAL OR MORAL PROTECTION FOR SECRETS (except actual theft
or constructive theft (someone who has proper access to the secret giving
it to someone who doesn't))

(3)  There is no legal (as far as I know) or moral protection against
reverse engineering of published data to reconstruct an algorithm that
could be used to produce it, which is EXACTLY what we are talking about.

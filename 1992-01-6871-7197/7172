PRNGs (I'm told) have periods approximating their word-size. What word-size
would be adequate?

Does this still apply if we use only 8 of the bits of each of the words the
PRNG returns? The "enemy" doesn't get the full state of the PRNG with a
chosen plaintext then, unless (quite likely :-) I'm missing something.

Suppose instead of (or in addition to) the xor we sort all the bytes using
the PRNG output as the key? Yes, I know you wouldn't implement it that way
really, but it's the easiest way to suggest the idea.

If that helps, does the required period of the PRNG decrease?

In case it isn't obvious, my thoughts had been stimulated much as Bob's
have been. I'm in no sense a cryptologist (although I play one on TV :-)
and this is mere layman's curiosity. It has always seemed to me that the
direct mathematical approach could be aided by perversity somehow.

Thanks for the discussion,

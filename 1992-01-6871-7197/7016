Re:    Where to get PGP
 
 
This is in response to your inquiry regarding how to get the freeware
public key cryptographic software PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) from an
anonymous FTP site on Internet, or from any other source.  
 
PGP has sophisticated key management, an RSA/conventional hybrid 
encryption scheme, message digests for digital signatures, data
compression before encryption, and good ergonomic design.  PGP is
well featured and fast, and has excellent user documentation.  Source
code is free.
 
What follows is a sample of places that allegedly have PGP.  This
information is not guaranteed to be correct.  If you care to set up any
additional reliable FTP sites, please let me know about it, including
the host name and directory, and how long you think it will be there.
 
PGP uses the RSA cryptosystem which is claimed by a US patent held by
a company called Public Key Partners.  PGP users outside the US take
note that there is no RSA patent outside the US.
 
Bear in mind that there are US and Canadian export laws prohibiting
anyone inside the US and Canada from exporting cryptographic software
like this.  If you live in another country, you are advised not to
violate US export laws by copying these files from a US source. 
Since thousands of US users got it, it has somehow leaked out of the
US and spread itself worldwide.  If PGP has already found its way
into your country, then you're probably not violating US export law
if you pick it up from a source outside of the US.  For those of you
who need to obtain PGP from sources outside the US, some foreign
sources are listed.
 
 
There are two compressed achive files in the PGP MSDOS release.  You
must get pgp10.zip which contains the binary executable and the PGP
User's Guide, and you can optionally get pgp10src.zip which contains
the source files.  These files can be decompressed with the MSDOS
shareware archive decompression utility PKUNZIP.EXE.
 
A reminder:  Set mode to binary or image when doing an FTP transfer.
 
Here are some FTP sites that have both pgp10.zip and pgp10src.zip:
 
              HOST                             DIRECTORY
USA:          uunet.uu.net (137.39.1.2)        /tmp
              pc.usl.edu (130.70.40.3)         /pub/msdos/crypto
              gatekeeper.dec.com (16.1.0.2)    /pub/micro/msdos/pgp
              ucbarpa.berkeley.edu (128.32.130.11)  /pub 
New Zealand:  kauri.vuw.ac.nz                  /pub/ms-dos/Encryption
 
Here are some FTP sites that have pgp10.zip:
 
Finland:      garbo.uwasa.fi (128.214.87.1)    /pc/fileutil
Australia:    sol.deakin.oz.au (128.184.1.1)   /pub/PC/chyde/fileutil
 
 
PGP is also available on PeaceNet and EcoNet, run by IGC in San
Francisco.  Log in and check the "micro" conference.  The Web in
Canada also has it.
 
PGP is also widely available on Fidonet, a large informal network of
PC-based bulletin board systems interconnected via modems.  Check
your local bulletin board systems.  It is available on many foreign
and domestic Fidonet BBS sites.
 
In the US, PGP may be found on God knows how many BBS systems, far
too many to list here.  Still, if you don't have any local BBS phone
numbers handy, here are some free little BBS's in Colorado you might
try:  303 652-3595, or 303 443-8292, or 303 231-0990.
 
In Toronto Canada, try this BBS:  416 798-4786
 
In New Zealand, try these (supposedly free) dial-up BBS systems:
   Amstrad BBS:   +64 9 445-3619
   Infoboard:     +64 9 833-8788
   Kappa Crucis:  +64 9 817-3714, -3725, -3324, -8424, -3094, -3393
 
In the Netherlands there is a BBS called Operation Hacker Storm that
is pushing PGP pretty heavily.  The phone number is:  +31 22 3060551
 
Also in the Netherlands, try Patrick Oonk, whose email address is:
   Internet:  ropg@ooc.uva.nl
   Phone:     +31 70 3642364
 
In Germany, try Hugh Kennedy, whose email address is:
   Internet:  70042.710@compuserve.com
   Compuserve: 70042,710
 
In Austria, try Michael Weiner, whose email addresses are:
   Eunet:     mweiner@bene.co.at

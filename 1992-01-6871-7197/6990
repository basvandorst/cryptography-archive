Even if Gemstar has VCR+ patented 25 different ways, you're still
allowed to publish an algorithm for generating the codes. You just
have to state that it's for academic research and the curious, and
that it's not to supplant the use of the VCR+ device.

Perfectly legal, and done all the time. How many times has the RSA
algorithm been published?

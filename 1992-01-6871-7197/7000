   several years ago i saw a demo of a device that combined VCRs with
   TELETEXT technology - in the UK, TV channels carry the TV schedules
   in _data_ on the spare lines not used for the picture (as well as a
   lot of other info)...
   the device simply read this listing, and allowed you to step a cursor 
   through the listing on screen, click on a program _name_ and tell your
   VCR to record that

I just brought a DeLuxe VCR into which I could (for about $200) plug a
TeleText card.  I'm still trying to decide... there aren't too many
TV/cable channels here, I really don't need it.  But one more toy :-)

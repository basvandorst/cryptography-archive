In response to an inquiry:

	Pawnshop ciphers are a *very* standard practice with small businesses.
Go into any small business, coin dealer, stamp dealer, pawnshop, musical
instrument dealer, curio shop, gunshop etc etc and examine the tags.  if 
you see a sequence of letters, you've got a pawnshop cipher.  Generaly the
code is something easy to remember such as   blackhorse, badwhiskey,
marylouise, snowflake (all actual codes for pawnshops in Austin).  Generaly
x stands for 0 or a multiple of 10.

	I am sure that someone that is into cryptology can look at this and say
"these are an example of a ..." cipher.  What class of cipher would these
fall into?  Once the class is known, then it might be easier to solve these.
Once again, I don't subscribe to this group, so I won't get to see the thread
that this post will generate unless someone mails it to me, but I's sure
like some help with attacking these things.

Cheers
Woody

In article <1992Jan17.022348.39873@camb.com>, I had replied to a question
asked in sci.crypt about PGP (Phil Zimmermann's Pretty Good Privacy).

This message has two parts - an apology and a gripe.

First I owe Phil and the net an apology for a breach in netequitte.  I
forwarded to the net a message from Phil that I'd saved on my system, I'd
guess from last summer.  It looked like a general posting from Phil to the
net, but in fact I had received it in private communications from Phil.  I
should not have posted it without first getting Phil's permission.  I was
lazy and didn't check.  I was wrong.  I'm sorry.

Phil called me today and we had a very nice chat.  Phil explained that
since the time he wrote that document and since the time that PGP was
posted at all those ftp sites last June, he has (under pressure from RSA,
I assume) agreed not to take any part in the distribution or promotion of
PGP.  I guess he was concerned that my posting could be interpreted as a
violation by him of some agreement.  It wasn't.

This brings me to my gripe.  If it's really true that RSA is threatening
Phil with legal action (and Phil clearly does not feel at liberty to talk
about this himself) then I think RSA is doing something really wrong. 

I'd like to find out the truth behind this and talk about it (possibly
here in sci.crypt) but I feel frustrated.  Clearly as much as he'd like
to do so, Phil will not feel at liberty to join us in this discussion.

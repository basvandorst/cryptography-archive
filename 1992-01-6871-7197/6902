      Unlikely.  It can't be a trade secret; they publish the numbers in
newspapers.  If it's patented, they have to disclose the technology, and
there's no restriction on talking about patented ideas.  Maybe Gemstar's
lawyers have dreamed up some kind of copyright theory, but claiming that
copyright on the data protects the compression algorithm that compressed it
is a new legal concept, well beyond what is normally thought of as being
covered by a copyright.  

      Has Gemstar actually done anything, or are they just making
threatening noises?

I had a strange thing happen to me some time ago and was wondering if anyone
here could explain it to me.  I bought a new truck and had an extra cruise 
control added by the dealer.  After a couple of months of operation, I noticed
one day sitting in a parking lot, with the ignition off that the radio just
started playing by itself.  I took the key out of the ignition all together
and the radio continued to play.  When I opened the door to look under the
hood, the radio stopped playing.  I then shut the door and for some reason
turned off the cruise control and the radio again stopped playing.  

I figured that I would take the truck back to the dealer later since I found 
that I could control this by the cruise control and not discharge the battery.
The next day, I could not make the radio play again without the ignition
key.  

Since I could not duplicate this, the dealer could not fix whatever the 
problem was and told me to turn off the cruise control every time I exited
the truck.  I didn't think that was the right answer, but what could I do!

A couple of weeks later, it was raining again and guess what happened?  I 
took the truck in that day and the dealer said they would look at it.  

When I picked up the truck, the dealer would only say that there was a 
wiring problem.  Does anyone have any idea what was going on here?

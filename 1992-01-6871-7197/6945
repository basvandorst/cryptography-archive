Thank you, this gives FEAL a definite advantage in practice, since the

Yes, but I'm not sure I'd be willing to select a cipher for a new design
that was already known to be vulnerable to even the most powerful attack
(chosen plaintext) when other ciphers can withstand the same attacks.

Care to share your FEAL-32 code?

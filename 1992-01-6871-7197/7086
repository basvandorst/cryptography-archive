Especially when you can acquire RSA keys quite easily by fingering
host kampi.hut.fi (130.233.224.2). Eg. giving command

finger 64@rsa-key@kampi.hut.fi

prints out something like:

[kampi.hut.fi]
Hello kampi.hut.fi (130.233.224.2)
P 3aec6257d6c3727f 4245876678108344959
Q 3a54174385df8a7 262688120688736423

Printout should be quite self-explanatory. I want to remind you that
you should not use these keys for anything serious because me or
someone else can probably spy them. But they are great as PKP-food.

To restrict load we allow only one key generation process at a time
and prime length is restricted to 257 bits.

And now the question:

What is current consensus on need to check generated primes for
strenghtness. Is it ok just to generate long primes and use them or
should we check something else? How about primes used with
Diffie-Hellman? Or El Gamal?

``Using RSA illegally''? No. Patent infringement has nothing to do with
illegal activities: there's no law which says ``thou shalt not use
RSA.'' A patent is an exclusive right to make/use/sell something, which
means (literally!) the right to exclude others, which means that the
patent owner can go to court and sue (i.e., try to get money out of)
someone who's making/using/selling the invention. In patent cases, the
alleged infringer has the right to challenge the validity of the patent.
(In most circuits he can do this before the court addresses the issue of
whether he actually infringed the patent.) Even *if* the RSA patent
holds up in court (and any RSA court case will be one of the hottest
patent cases in years), and even *if* it is decided that PGP infringes
upon the patent, nobody has broken the law.

You don't need hardware if you only need 9600 baud.  You can hit
approximately 50K bytes (not bits) per second on a 386sx/20 if you use
assembly code and David Feldemeier's technique (from CRYPTO '89 I
think).  This requires about 96K of memory for lookup tables.  If you
use small tables (4K) you can still hit 8K/sec.  Thus to achieve
1Kbyte per sec (i.e. 9600 baud) you need a processor 1/50th of the
power of a 386sx/20, which shouldn't be too hard.  Obviously there is
some system overhead which you need to add to these figures.

My shareware program SDCRYPT does this, so these timings are measured,
not theoretical.

DES chips hit on the order of megabytes per second.

Also, if you can ditch the IP/inverse IP (which has little or no
cryptographic value) you can improve the speed considerably.  This
will affect compatiblity but not security.

No problem.

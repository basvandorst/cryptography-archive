True.  The place to start looking is the proceesings of CRYPTO '90
(published by Springer).  It contains a summary of Biham and Shamir's
method and a full chosen plaintext attack on FEAL-8.

FEAL-32 is 32 round FEAL.  In other words the algorithm is exactly the
same as FEAL-8 but with more iterations in the encryption and key
scehdule.  Also FEAL-NX is FEAL with a 128 bit key.  Full specs are in
CRYPTO '90.  

Biham and Shamir say that FEAL with any number of rounds less than 32
is breakable by their method in less time than exhaustive search
(which is 2^63 encryptions on average).

> Comments?

Biham and Shamir's attack doen't work in CBC mode, so presents no
practical threat to secrecy.  However, it is a real threat to digital
signature schemes based on FEAL-8.

My software implementations of DES run at a speed similar to FEAL-32,
so most of the speed advantage of FEAL over DES is lost if you use
FEAL-32.

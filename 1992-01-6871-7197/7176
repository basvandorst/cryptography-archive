See Knuth's exercises in the last section on random numbers. It is safe
to assume that if your generator keeps N bits of real information then
any cN bits of its output suffice to easily reconstruct the generator's
state, for relatively small constants c. This is true for linear
congruential generators, additive generators, etc.

I saw something similar once -- maybe it will give you an idea.  A
friend wired a night light into his car.  Of course, he did the wiring
in the daytime.  It worked fine, until the headlights were turned on,
causing the light to go out.  He asked me to look at it.  It turned out that
the wire he spliced into for a ground was a hot wire for the instrument
lights.  When the headlights were off, the wire had a low (enough) resistance 
path to ground through all the lamp fiaments, and the night light worked.
When the headlights were on, the wire was at +12v, no voltage drop
across the night light, no light.

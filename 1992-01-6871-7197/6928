No, the REAL question is, "what about existing VCR's" that *are* hard 
to program?

Actually, my VCR wasn't "cheap".  But it is old.  I like its features and
performance in every aspect except programmability.  Unfortunately, these
boxes do not have field upgrade software for the parts that are inadequate.

Here's the cycle:
   1) Only four preset programs are allowed.
   2) It's programmed with front panel buttons ONLY
   3) Once the program has been executed, it's deleted (!!)

I got tired of punching in the same thing week after week!  Maybe if/when
this one breaks, I'll get one of the "full-featured" ones with the
on-screen programming, etc.  But not yet!

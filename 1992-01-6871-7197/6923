If Gemstar had superenciphered their codes with a private key, and
used a public key to decipher them, it would not have been so easy to
break the codes. 

What I don't know is whether such a scheme would yield short
ciphertext for short plaintext. Does anyone have more expert
knowledge?

And, of course, they'd have to pay royalties to RSA for each
controller sold, unless someone comes up with a PD public-key system
that's provably secure.

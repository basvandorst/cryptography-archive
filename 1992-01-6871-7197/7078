Bob, like Kevin, is completely misinterpreting my statements to mean
something which they do not say.

I once again state that it is much more difficult to solve the discrete
log problem with 2n bits than it is to factor a typical n-bit number. It
is also much more difficult to factor a 2n-bit number than to solve the
discrete log problem with n bits. (For definiteness say n >= 200.)

These rules are easy to apply. For example, a 1024-bit NIST DSA key is
much more difficult to break than a 512-bit RSA key, while a 1024-bit
RSA key is much more difficult to break than a 512-bit NIST DSA key. I'm
sure sci.crypt readers can see how this applies to the discussions of
NIST DSA. In fact, it neatly summarizes the part of Dan Gordon's letter
(just posted) which any policy maker can be expected to understand.

Now when Bob writes the following:

In article <1992Jan21.132644.27590@linus.mitre.org> bs@faron.mitre.org (Robert D. Silverman) writes:

he is arguing against something which I didn't say, namely that
factoring and discrete logs run at the same speed for a given number of
bits. His comments are therefore, like Kevin's, irrelevant.

Now *that* is wild exaggeration. Neither Bob nor anyone else has ever
factored a general number between 450 and 600 bits. In fact, Bob's
personal record is around 385 bits, right, Bob? Bob's implication that
those figures are based on ``direct measurement'' is simply wrong.
Extrapolation beyond your experience is a very, very bad idea in
cryptography.

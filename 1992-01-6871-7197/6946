It'll be interesting to see if this changes with the new Shamir paper on
DES.

Actually, I thought FEAL's advantage was in being specifically
designed for easy implementation in *software*, not hardware. DES can
certainly be implemented very fast in hardware too, but it is a real
bear to do in software. After doing a DES myself, I tend to support
the theory that says it was deliberately designed to make it as slow
as possible in software.

The only way to make DES go fast in software is to throw megabytes of
memory at it for precomputed lookup tables. (See Dave Feldmeier's
paper on this subject in Crypto '89).  Being able to produce a small
and fast FEAL would give it a significant practical advantage over
DES.

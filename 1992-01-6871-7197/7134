If these are based on additive sequences related to primitive polynomials
mod 2, then they wouldn't be cryptographically secure even though they
would satisfy many tests for randomness for simulation and such and
have absurdly long periods; with some linear algebra and a remarkably
short sample of the sequence you can figure out the whole sequence.

The weakness of pseudorandom binary sequences in this regard was reported
by Gilbert (I believe) long ago at Bell Labs and applies to other simple
additive schemes as well.

But I haveen't seen the paper you cite; can you give an example of
one of their generators?

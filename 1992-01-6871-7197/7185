1) install a tsr on the machines involved in encryption that looks for
patterns of keyboard presses and records the passwords used.  a handy
way to introduce this is via a virus.

2) inspect memory for records of the keys used.  unless great care is
taken under dos, the memory used by a program can be inspected by
later programs.

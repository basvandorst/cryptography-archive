      Current processing lag at the Patent and Trademark Office is 
about 1 to 3 years.  Has anyone checked to see if a patent has been
issued, and if so, what it covers?

      The US PTO keeps patents secret until issued, but many foreign
patent offices publish them shortly after submission to allow others
to object to their issuance.  It might be worthwhile to check with the
common European patent office to see if there's anything available.
They may be on Lexis.

      Just applying for a patent doesn't guarantee that one will be issued.
And the PTO may limit how much the patent covers, by rejecting claims.

      The PTO takes the position that you can't patent a "mathematical
formula", but the Supreme Court ordered them to accept computer programs
as inventions.  This one comes close to the line, since what we have
here is a formula that takes in a few numbers and creates another number.
It's going to be an interesting decision for the PTO to make.

      (Incidentally, I'm an inventor who's dealt with the PTO, not a patent
lawyer.)

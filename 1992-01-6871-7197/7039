An assumption that seems to be made when evaluating the security of
a cryptosystem is that the enemy will know the system being used.

This is a reasonable assumption when one is going to encrypt data,
transmit it to someone else, and have them decrypt it.

However, suppose the purpose for encrypting the data is to store
it locally for infrequent access?  Suppose I am willing to type
in the source code from memory for my cryptosystem, compile it,
encrypt or decrypt my files, and then delete the encryption
program (both source and compiled version)?

Suppose the encryption algorithm was something like this:

	1. Generate two streams of psuedorandom numbers.

	2. Use Knuth's algorithm for combining two random number
	generators.

	3. Xor with the with the resulting random number stream.

	4. Block the data into binary matrices, and let Mathematica
	invert them for me.

How safe would such a procedure be?

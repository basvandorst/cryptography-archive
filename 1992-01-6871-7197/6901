Did I miss something here? Has someone broken into the offices of
Gemstar and stolen the secrets of VCR+? 

Or are you confusing reverse-engineering with theft?

I would hate to live in a world where progress wasn't needed because
there was no competition. Just how much innovation occurs for
intellectual curiosity instead of for keeping a commercial advantage?
Just why DO those big companies spend so much money?

What privacy? Gemstar is a commercial venture. They spend money to keep
their name in front of the public, which seems like a very odd way of
trying to have 'privacy'.

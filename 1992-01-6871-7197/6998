several years ago i saw a demo of a device that combined VCRs with
TELETEXT technology - in the UK, TV channels carry the TV schedules
in _data_ on the spare lines not used for the picture (as well as a
lot of other info)...
the device simply read this listing, and allowed you to step a cursor 
through the listing on screen, click on a program _name_ and tell your
VCR to record that

a "minor" added bonus was that the VCR watched for changes on the
listing lines, and actually triggered of the latest info (so if the
ball game ran late, you didnt lose the end of your film:-)

another piece of technology similar enough to probably represent prior
art is the publication of bar codes in UK TV listing magazines
and availability of bar code readers to program your VCR

the VCR+ is not ingenious - it is the pathetic consequence of the
inability of the VCR manufacturers and TV broadcast companies to agree
on more useful standards (as well as most VCR manufacturers to design
a 7% friendly user interface)

i'm also surpirsed if anyone lets a patent through as it is blindingly
obvious...

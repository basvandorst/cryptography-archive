Absolutely incorrect. Before a valid patent exists there can be no
infringement. Period. As soon as the patent is granted, the holder owns
the right to exclude everyone else from making, using, or selling his
invention, but he cannot do anything about use before the patent was
granted.

Incorrect. There has never been, to my knowledge, a single example of
someone being prosecuted for distributing exact copies of a patent. It
would be stretching the doctrine of contributory infringement beyond
reason to say that merely by distributing copies of a patent you're
encouraging infringement of that patent.

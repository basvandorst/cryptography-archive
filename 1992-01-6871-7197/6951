	 They must guard their algorithm because it is the only thing
which allows *them* to make money rather than *other* companies.  You see,
if they'd come out with a device which programmed in plaintext like so:

	1 10 6:30p 0:30 12 == 30min. on Ch. 12 starting @ 1830 on Jan. 10.

then *NO ONE* would need to pay them for *anything*, would they?

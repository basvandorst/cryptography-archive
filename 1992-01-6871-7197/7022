PGP has been around for a while.  I think I have a copy someplace.  It's
only for PCs, however, so I don't use it.  As I recall, he recommends
buying a license for RSA before using the code.

The article is sensationalist.  Coming closer to the definitive
encryption program is PEM: the emerging Internet standard for encrypted
mail.  It, too, uses RSA.

Meanwhile, the notion that Congress [in S266 and S618] could legislate a
backdoor in software encryption is ludicrous when any programmer with a
PC could write his own encryption program, using publicly available DES
as a component.  You might as well try to make sex between teenagers
illegal.

Oh -- that's been tried, hasn't it?  Oh well.  I suppose the Congress
could try to write such legislation.  It's not like drugs passing the
FDA tests.  Legislation doesn't have to be proved efficacious.  :-)

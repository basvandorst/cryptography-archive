But statistically, when you say ``user on the Internet,'' you're most
likely talking about someone using a BSD-derived machine---and such
users are most able to put encryption technology to immediate use.
Would be able, that is, if RSA Inc. weren't doing its utmost to prevent
the use of cryptography on the Internet. (Further discussions of patents
should go on in comp.patents, which was created to get this material out
of sci.crypt and various other groups.)

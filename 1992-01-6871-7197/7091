You're probably talking about the version from TIS, Inc.  Last I heard,
the plan was still to release a free source copy of most of the code.
I believe, though, that some small portion consists of object code
only, from RSADSI.  And you'll still need to buy certificates from
RSADSI, at ~$25 for two years, or get them from your own organization.

It's worth noting, btw, that RSADSI says that much of the cost is for
the certification, not a patent royalty.  No matter who ran the
certificate signing cetner, there would still be some cost to recoup.
The security requirements for certificate centers are quite stringent.
But from what I've seen in draft and issued RFCs, it's quite legal
for some organization to issue its own certificates for less, as long
as they pay the proper royalties for the patent for each one issued.
How such an organization would be funded is problematic.  At AT&T,
for example, it's all but certain that there would be an internal
chargeback scheme, both to cover the royalty cost and to cover the
costs of the organization that handed out keys.

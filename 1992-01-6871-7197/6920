Noted that the major value VCR+ offers in our market is that it
programs the brainless boxes the cable company has forced (through
scrambling) us to use to decode signals for our otherwise cable ready
VCRs.    At best in such a situation we would have to program both the
VCS (for times to record channel 3) and the cable box (to tune to the
right channel at that time.)

Now if someone would just sell a box that takes normal times and
channel number, is taught the remote codes for the VCS and cable box,
and preferable has a large memory for programming, it should blow VCR+
out of the water.  I'd certainly pay more for that convience.

Perhaps I should add the other half: It's much more difficult to factor
a typical 2n-bit number than it is to solve the discrete log problem
with n bits. I'm not willing to use any number lower than 2 in either of
these statements, as current asymptotics aren't precise enough to
pinpoint the relative standings of discrete logs and factoring by any
available method.

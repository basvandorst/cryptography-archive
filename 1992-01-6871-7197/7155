Indeed, it would be completely crazy to allow anyone other than
yourself to have anything to do with creating your key.  Note that the
security comes from selecting the key out of a very large potential
key space, typically hundreds or thousands of bits in size.  It is the
size of this keyspace which prevents brute force testing of all keys.
Say someone produced an otherwise perfectly acceptable key generator
which produced excellent random keys from a restricted subset of these
valid keys, perhaps from a subset of a trillion possible keys.  They
need have no communication with their box, need not store your key, or
do anything else except limit this key generator selection space to
severely compromise your key.  Further tests on these keys for
primality, weakness against known attacks, etc. are totally irrelevant
once the keyspace is small enough.  And you (or anyone else) have NO
WAY OF KNOWING that this has happened.  I suggest you flip your own coins.

The requirement that the average person needs to trust a key
generation facility, program, or hardware device is one of my main
worries in the widespread adoption of RSA.

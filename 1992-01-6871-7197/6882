This doesn't follow.  They could have simply given the newspapers a
set of floppies with information like:

   Tuesday, Channel 3, 11:30 pm, 2 hours -->  123456

They would certainly copyright the actual numbers used for a particular
day/channel/time/duration combination, but that just forces the developers
of VCR++ to create, and publish, their own, while allowing them (VCR+)
to claim royalties for each publication.

They could copyright the codes (preventing someone else from selling
them) and _their_ software used to encode/decode them, but anyone could
build another programmable controller and toss in their own source code
to decode the VCR+ listing without infringing copyright.  

In fact, you could not _copyright_ the sequence of VCR commands since
there is only one manner of expression.  This is why chip manufactors can
copyright their symbolic opcodes (since you could use "AND" or "LogAnd" or
"Fooblitz") but not their binary opcodes (since only a 01101101 will
perform a "logical and" operation).  (A little known, and useful,
tidbit of copyright law gleaned off the network a while back).

Once again, selling your own "VCR+" listings is another matter...
Long term, that is where their money is because they will NOT be able
to prevent low-cost imported knockoffs of the controller, unless they
have patented the entire idea.

I can't disagree with that.

I don't know the exact relationship, but the two organizations seem to work
closely together; I think the main difference is that RSADSI employs hackers
and PK Partners employs lawyers.  In any event, RSADSI has a cooperative deal
with PK Partners and seems to be the major (only?) player in the public key
world.  Maybe someone involved with the PEM development effort (in which
multiple software vendors are implementing an RSA-based secure email system
for the Internet) could clarify the relationship.

On the subject of PEM, the word from RSADSI about eight months ago was
that a free PEM implementation including source code would be made
available by one of the vendors involved in the project.  The release
of PEM software seems to be nowhere in sight,  but if a free version
appears, it would make a lot of us Internet hackers much happier.

Of course public key systems have complications around key management.
However, these are protocol problems not unlike normal communications
protocol problems.  These problems do not compromise the encryption used in
the public key system.  They affect only the convenience of its use.

With private key systems, the repeated use of a single key produces an
immediate cryptanalytic weakness in the system.  If one uses per-message
keys to counteract that weakness, then those keys have to be communicated
and that, too, provides a possible point of cryptanalytic entry.

The security threat implied with public key systems is that of spoofing --
quite real but of a different class from cryptanalysis because if a message
is intercepted that way, the proper recipient knows immediately that
something is wrong because he can no longer decrypt messages intended for
him.  If a private key system is broken by cryptanalysis, neither proper
party to the conversation knows that the break has occurred.

Funny you should ask. I bought one for my dad for Christmas, and setting it
up for him was easy.

You set the date and time.

You look up the VCR manufacturer in a table in the manual, and enter the
two-digit code for your manufacturer. VCR+ attempts to turn the VCR on, 
change to channel 9, record for a second or two, then turn the VCR off. If
this works, press <SAVE>; otherwise, I think the box would try a different
combination for that manufacturer (I don't know - Dad's worked first time).

The mechanism for mapping channels isn't quite as trivial; I'm glad that
they don't change often, 'cuz I think Dad would rather program his VCR
to record shows from the odd channels than reprogram the VCR+!

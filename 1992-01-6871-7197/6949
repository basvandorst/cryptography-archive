Plaintext is more error prone than entering the VCR+ number.  When you
enter the VCR+ number, the unit displays the date, time, and channel.
If you make a mistake in data entry, you either get an error or you
get a date, time, and channel that are wildly wrong.  This is easy
to spot.

When entering with plaintext, it is much easier to make a mistake and
not notice it.

Note also that the VCR+ numbers are easier to enter for most programs
that people want to tape.  Prime time shows on low numbered channels
tend to have short numbers (2 to 4 digits).  Plaintext entry would
probably take more keystrokes.

What might be interesting would be to start a service that makes TV
listings available online.  You would sell software that would call
the service late each weekend to get the next week's listings.

This software would display the listings on your computer, and you
just click on the shows you wish to record.  The software would
control the VCR and cable box via an IR unit attached to the
serial port.

And once the listings are downloaded, all kinds of possibilites
open up, e.g., search and wildcard features to locate shows in
the listings.

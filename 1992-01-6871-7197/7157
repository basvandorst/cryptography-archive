Certainly one should not pay good money for insecure commercial encryption
software.  But *secure* - and well-designed - commercial encryption
software is another matter.  And there is a lot more to good, usable
encryption software than a secure encryption method.  I'm prepared to
believe that your code is a competent (possibly even brilliant)
implementation of DES in its various modes, and for some that may be all
that is needed.  But if one has some heavy-duty encryption needs then a
free but no-frills encryption package may not suffice.  Some questions to
be considered when evaluating encryption software are the following, which
are an answer to the question in your posting:
 
1.  Does the allow long encryption keys (the better to remember) and any
typeable and displayable character in keys (so they can be in English,
rather than in hex)?
 
2.  Does it allow encryption of multiple files with a single command?
Multiple files in multiple subdirectories?  Can complex operations be
automated?
 
3.  Is there an option for encryption or decryption without destroying the
original data?
 
4.  Does the software compress the data as well as encrypt it?
 
5.  Does the software provide encrypted output as text as well as binary?
 
6.  Can floppy disks - as well as files - be encrypted?
 
7.  Is there provision for purging sensitive data which has been encrypted
but which may still exist on disk in plaintext form but yet not visible?
 
8.  Does the software provide means for producing a permanent record of its
operations, providing information about the files being encrypted or
decrypted?
 
9.  Is there provision for recovery of the plaintext if an encryption key
is lost?  If the company file containing all the encryption keys gets
trashed (with no backup) will the company suffer irreparable harm?

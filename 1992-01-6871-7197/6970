For our Senior Research project in Mathematical Cryptology, our group
is looking for papers, articles, books and materials related to
cryptological studies.  Please pass along any sources you feel relevant.
If there is interest in this source list I will post.  Also I would
appreciate any pointers to the sci.crypt archives.

Thanks,

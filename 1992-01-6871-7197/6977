Wrong.  According to "Patent it yourself": "Many people believe that a person
who copies an invention on which a patent is pending is liable for
infringement.  This isn't true.  You have no monopoly or rights until
your patent actually issues.  In other words, a manufactured article covered
by a pending patent application can be freely copied by anyone."

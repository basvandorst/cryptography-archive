Greetings!

I have played with the PGP package and it seems to me that all it does is RSA
the _key_, then encrypts the _text_ using a semi-modified DES.  I have only
a executable copy for dos, so I have not looked at the source code.  But am
I correct?  One of the reasons that I have come to this conclusion is that
it is so _fast!_  I wasn't aware that RSA could be implemented so quickly.

If this is so, I don't think this package is even "pretty" good.

Flames?  Comments?

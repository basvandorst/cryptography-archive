Yes - for the controller! I suppose a device this original and clever
could be worth a patent. And the coding scheme. It is nice, short, and
easy, but there is absolutely no need to keep it secret. Just patent
the device, that's it.

And if they are relying on keeping the code secret, then I can't see
any reason to cry if someone breaks it.

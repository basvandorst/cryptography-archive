Are there any more effective general techniques for testing a (relatively
high) m'th degree polynomial for primitivity over GF(2) than successive
squaring of, say, x, mod the polynomial, and checking that x^(2^m-1) == 1
while x^r != 1 for any factor r of 2^m-1?

This technique is pretty simple and obvious given the basic theory of
finite fields and seems usable for about 1000'th degree polynomials,
but what about screening really high degree trinomials and the like?
I know there are a few papers listing them (but haven't gotten copies
to look at.) Do they all rely on more of less adhoc trickery for each
polynomial?

Actually, another natural question arises.  There exist degrees where
there are no primitive trinomials.  Are there any which don't have any
primitive weight 5 polynomials?  It isn't clear to me that there wouldn't
be, once you get to a high enough degree but I don't know of any examples.

I'm unfamiliar with the literature on this, so thought I'd ask to get
some pointers and ideas.

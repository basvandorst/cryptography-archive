Have you read the chapter on `Snake Oil' in the PGP user guide?  In
summary, it says that there are a lot of encryption algorithms out
there that were not designed by professional cryptographers.  What
seems a good idea to a lay person often isn't as good as it seems,
sometimes for very subtle reasons.  The bottom line -- don't trust a
homebrew cryptographic algorithm.

(I should point out that I'm not a cryptographic expert)

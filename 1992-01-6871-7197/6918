}It is called a VCR. I don't understand the problem with programming
}any VCR that has reasonable on-screen programming....

For many folk, the BIG advantage of VCR+ is that it'll change the
station on your cable box in sync with turning your VCR on and off.
The problem is that the particular way the VCR+ folk have chosen to
*implement* this nice feature is pretty cretinous [what with the
content-free many digit numbers].  If someone 'broke' the code and so
there was some competition in the marketplace, maybe we could have the
cleverness of VCR+'s multi-device IR programmer and auto-changing
coupled with things like, as you say, like on-screen programming and
maybe other nice stuff.

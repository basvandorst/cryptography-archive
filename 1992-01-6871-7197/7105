I was requested to take my legal questions to comp.patents regarding usage
of patented devices.  Here are some case extracts thanks to Dan Bernstein:

So it seems that it is ok to use this stuff for experiment or entertainment
or philosophy (!?) but according to Dan's unsupported final statement not
to use in the course of business.  For most of us this it means according to
the body of law represented here it is just fine.  By most of us I mean
those that are using this net for entertainment and those for which it was
originally formed, the research community.  I am going to post further in
comp.patents asking for substantiation of his last paragraph.  There is
further stuff over there regarding jurisdiction and it seems to have been
consolidated under one federal court so regional issues don't apply.

Since VCR+ is (I assume) only protected by its trade secret status, Gemstar
(as you point out in a part of the article not quoted above) probably
has no legal way to prevent the release of the information.

So the question now becomes, if Gemstar were to decide to pay you money
to not release the software and you were to accept the money, could they
then prosecute you for extortion? ;-) ;-) ;-)

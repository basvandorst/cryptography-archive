Barcodes.

In case you do not know how barcodes on letters work:

The bars come in tall and short.  The first and last bar is a tall "frame"
bar.  Every 5 bars in between represent a digit.

Each digit consists of two tall bars(1's) and three shorts (0's).
The values of the column positions are:
	7, 4, 2, 1, 0
with the 7+4 combination being assigned to be 0.
The digits are:
0= 11000
1= 00011
2= 00101
3= 00110
4= 01001
5= 01010
6= 01100
7= 10001
8= 10010
9= 10100

The last digit of the bar code is a check digit.  When all digits including
the check digit are added together, the value must be a multiple of 10.

Barcodes can exist for the 9 digit ZIP+4 or just the 5 digit ZIP code.

Bar code dimensions are:

         Long bar height: .125" +- .010"
        Short bar height: .050" +- .010"
               Bar width: .020" +- .005"
      Horizontal spacing: 21 bars/inch +- 1 bar/inch
  Pitch (bar plus space): .045" to .050"

Bar code location on envelope:
        Bars must be located in a box 3/16" to 7/16" from bottom
        1st bar must begin from 4" to 3 7/8" from right edge
        Prefered base line (bottom of bars): 1/4" from bottom
        
Strangely, the spec for ZIP+4 says the 1st bar can begin from 4" to 
3 1/4" from the right edge of the envelope.  But the spec for a simple
ZIP code says the 1st bar must start from 4" to 3 7/8".


The reason that I know all of this is that I just made my HP Desk Jet Plus
printer do all the graphics that is necessary to print these on envelopes
as part of a phone book/evenlope printing program that I have.  The bummer
is that after making the damn thing do it all, I found out that the HP
Desk Jet will not print on the bottom 1/2" of whatever sheet that it is
working on!!!

Considering that most machines on the Internet (I mean the ones you can
address by octets such as "129.38.1.4") allow users to be 'net-fingered',
is a key authority really necessary?  Any user wishing to publish his/her
public key could simply place it (UUENCODEd) in their .plan-type file for
anyone on the net to see.  To check a key's authenticity, simply 'finger'
the user (eg.:  finger rick@ee.uwm.edu > key.uue ) and UUDECODE the key.

Certainly, it's *possible* that a crooked SysOp might fidget with the
nfinger daemon, but that could be so on any "authority"'s box as well.

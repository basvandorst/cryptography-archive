# Cypherpunks anonymous remailer easy installation
# Version 1.0 Sameer <sameer@soda.berkeley.edu>
# Remailer written by Eric Hughes and Hal Finney

# This script suite cleanly installs a cypherpunks remailer into
# a UNIX account, simply by executing this script. This script
# modifies the .forward file. It shouldn't mess up your
# day-to-day mail, even if you're already using the .forward file.
# (No guarantees)

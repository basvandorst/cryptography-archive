<H2>Fan mail, updates, and news</H2>
<P>After all this work I have to admit I wouldn't mind getting some fan
mail for PGP, to gauge its popularity.  Let me know what you think
about it and how many of your friends use it.  Bug reports and
suggestions for enhancing PGP are welcome, too.  Perhaps a future PGP
release will reflect your suggestions.  
<P>This project has not been funded and the project has nearly eaten me
alive.  This means you usually won't get a reply to your mail, unless
you only need a short written reply and you include a stamped
self-addressed envelope.  But I often do reply to E-mail.  Please
keep it in English, as my foreign language skills are weak.  If you
call and I'm not in, it's best to just try again later.  I usually
don't return long distance phone calls, unless you leave a message
that I can call you collect, and even then I might not return your
call.  If you need any significant amount of my time, I am available
on a paid consulting basis, and I always return those calls.
<P>The most inconvenient mail I get is for some well-intentioned person
to send me a few dollars asking me for a copy of PGP.  I don't send 
it to them because I'd rather avoid any legal problems with PKP.  Or
worse, sometimes these requests are from foreign countries, and I
would be risking a violation of US cryptographic export control
laws.  Even if there were no legal hassles involved in sending PGP to
them, they usually don't send enough money to make it worth my time.
I'm just not set up as a low cost low volume mail order business.  I
can't just ignore the request and keep the money, because they
probably regard the money as a fee for me to fulfill their request.
If I return the money, I might have to get in my car and drive down
to the post office and buy some postage stamps, because these
requests rarely include a stamped self-addressed envelope.  And I
have to take the time to write a polite reply that I can't do it.  If
I postpone the reply and set the letter down on my desk, it might be
buried within minutes and won't see the light of day again for
months.  Multiply these minor inconveniences by the number of
requests I get, and you can see the problem.  Isn't it enough that
the software is free?  It would be nicer if people could try to get
PGP from any of the myriad other sources.  If you don't have a modem,
ask a friend to get it for you.  If you can't find it yourself, I
don't mind answering a quick phone call.
<P>If anyone wants to volunteer to improve PGP, please let me know.  It
could certainly use some more work.  Some features were deferred to
get it out the door.  A number of PGP users have since donated their
time to port PGP to Unix on Sun SPARCstations, to Ultrix, to VAX/VMS,
to OS/2, to the Amiga, and to the Atari ST.  Perhaps you can help
port it to some new environments.  But please let me know if you plan
to port or add enhancements to PGP, to avoid duplication of effort,
and to avoid starting with an obsolete version of the source code.  
<P>Because so many foreign language translations of PGP have been
produced, most of them are not distributed with the regular PGP
release package because it would require too much disk space. 
Separate language translation "kits" are available from a number of
independent sources, and are sometimes available separately from the
same distribution centers that carry the regular PGP release
software.  These kits include translated versions of the file 
LANGUAGE.TXT, PGP.HLP, and the PGP User's Guide.  If you want to
produce a translation for your own native language, contact me first
to get the latest information and standard guidelines, and to find
out if it's been translated to your language already.  To find out
where to get a foreign language kit for your language, you might
check on the Internet newsgroups, or get it from Mike Johnson
(mpj@csn.org).
<P>If you have access to the Internet, watch for announcements of new
releases of PGP on the Internet newsgroups <I>sci.crypt</I> and PGP's own
newsgroup, <I>alt.security.pgp</I>.  If you want to know where to get PGP,
MIT is the primary FTP distribution site (net-dist.mit.edu).  Or ask
Mike Johnson (mpj@csn.org) for a list of Internet FTP sites and BBS
phone numbers.

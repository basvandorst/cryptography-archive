Sitelock V 1.01: Description
----------------------------

Sitelock is a little hack that should prevent your binaries (=sun4 binaries,
currently) from beeing run on another site. To use sitelock, you will need
sitelock source, and the source to your code (e.g the binaries you whish
to lock). Take the following steps:

1) build makekey with "make make_key" 

2) After a successfull build, run make_key, to generate the key you need
   for your site. Add or replace the char key[] statement in in your sitelock
   c source (sitelock.c) with this key.

3) make trial this should leave you with a binary called trial. Running it
   should show you an "Authorization ok" message. Running it on another site
   will delete the binary. This is controled by the nadda() call. You can
   of course call other code from nadda if you whish.

4) Look at trial.c it should show you how sitelock is used. check_perm()
   returns 0 if authorization fails and 1 if its ok.

Now to the question, "Is this secure ?". No, someone who can use a binary 
editor can either change the key value to suit his or her site, or change
the branches in your binary to bypass check_perm. However it should keep
casuall browsers out. The only real way to keep anyone else out is with 
some self_decrypting code, I've been thinking about dooing something along
those lines, but haven't had time yet.

BRUTE FORCE CRACKING:

* Estimation of completion time.
* Suspend/resume for long passwords.
* Semi-automated mode, starting at passwd_length=1 and going up.
* Possibility to have static characters in the password, ie pas?wo??
* Distributed cracking.


DICTIONARY BASED CRACKING:

* Any ideas?


A simple "I'm using your program" mail will enhance the possibility
of new versions :-). Any suggestions are welcome. Really!

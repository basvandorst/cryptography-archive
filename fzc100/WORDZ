# FZC 1.00 sample wordlist
#
# Lines beginning with a "#" are ignored and can be used to store
# wordlist information, comments, etc.
#
# Note1: FZC will use only the first 32 characters of the words.
#
# Note2: The mutation routines need the words in lowercase. For
#        special words such as BiCapitalization, you can include the
#        lowercase and the "right" form.
#
# Note3: The EOL can be either LF (*ix) or CR/LF (DOS).
#        A [CR/]LF in the last line is optional.
#        The EOF is 0x1A (26 dec = ^Z) and is optional.

The file DECP.C is a C version of the cryptogram deciphering program
described in my article in the September CACM.  As there were many
variations of the program exploring different word ordering
heuristics, and the code is not very clearly documented, and it all
happened 2.5 years ago, I am not certain that this version is closest
to the details given in the paper, but I think it is.  

The file DECIPHER.DCT is a plain ascii 1000 word dictionary in the
format expected by the program.  This was typed in from the Brown
University tabulation, listed as reference [6] in the CACM article.
You can shorten it by cutting off the last half or three quarters to
speed the search.

Some typos in the paper: 
  p. 102, The spaces in the example cipher text and plain text should
          have been preserved.
  p. 104, 3 lines after (6), delete "quitexio"
  p. 105-106, Figures 2 and 3 are swapped.  Captions are correct.
  p. 106, insert "}" after "RETURN" in procedure SOLVE
  (And, I don't know why footnotes 2 and 3 ended up where they are.)


Also, I have become aware of a similar, earlier approach, which I
should have cited in my paper (but I was not aware of at the 
time) described in:
  Nagy, Seth, & Einspahr, IEEE Trans. PAMI-9, (1987) pp. 710--715,
  "Decoding Substitution Ciphers by Means of Word Matching, with
   Application to OCR"
It uses a similar tree-based approach, but with different heuristics,
tuned to longer cryptograms (100-600 words,) as a font-independent
approach to character recognition.

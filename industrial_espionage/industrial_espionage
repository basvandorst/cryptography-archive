	WASHINGTON (UPI) -- The CIA has warned more than 70 U.S. defense,
aerospace and financial firms their industrial secrets are targets of
French intelligence agents and diplomats.
	The warning led Hughes Aircraft Co. to drop plans to exhibit
aerospace equipment at the Paris Air Show in June, according to
published reports.
	A 21-page French government document from about 1990 outlines U.S.
aerospace and defense corporate secrets in which French companies are
interested, U.S. industry officials said.
	Defense Week said Monday the memo targets 49 companies and 24
financial institutions in the U.S.
	The unsigned, undated document, in French and stamped ``Defense
Confidential,'' said French diplomats in the U.S. should focus on
research work, marketing strategies and U.S. positions in trade
disputes, the Washington Post said Tuesday.
	Hughes officials said they were told one item the French memo lists
is Hughes' HS601 communications satellite. French firms recently outbid
Hughes to provide $258 million in communications spacecraft to Arab
countries.
	A French embassy spokesman told the Washington Post, ``There is
nothing in this document to indicate that it was released by French
government offices.''
	Japan also has tried to obtain U.S. industrial secrets, government
officials have said.
	U.S. intelligence agencies long have privately told U.S. business
executives on trips to France and some other allied nations to closely
guard their firms' secrets while abroad.
	The debate over whether the CIA and other intelligence agencies
should practice industrial espionage for U.S. firms ``is the hottest
current topic in intelligence policy,'' CIA Director R. James Woolsey
said during his confirmation hearings. His predecessor, Robert Gates,
opposed the practice.
	Industry specialists and intelligence experts maintain the practice
is full of foreign policy and legal difficulties.
	A CIA official told the Washington Post the agency's sharing of the
French memo is a continuation of tipping U.S. firms when the government
learns of attempts at industrial espionage.
	The London Sunday Times said April 11 the French memo included
information about the private life of then-President George Bush. U.S.
authorities responded by tightening security procedures for government
officials, the paper said.

Several people have made incorrect statements about French laws on
cryptography.  I already posted detailed references in this newsgroup
two months ago (28 Oct), but it might be useful to post them again:

  The "decret du 18 avril 1939" defines 8 categories of arms and munitions
  from most dangerous (1st category) to least dangerous (8th).

  The "decret 73-364 du 12 mars 1973" specifies that cryptography
  equipment belongs to the second category. Any usage of such equipment
  requires authorization from the Prime minister. The authorization
  cannot be given to people who have committed a crime, or to alcoholic
  people. (If you want to encrypt your email, don't drink :-)

  The "decret 86-250 du 18 fev 1986" extends the definition of
  cryptography equipment to include software. It specifies that each
  request for authorizing professional *OR PRIVATE* usage of the
  equipment must be sent to the minister of the PTT (telecommunications).
  The request must include a complete and detailed description of the
  "cryptologic process", and if this is materially possible, of two
  copies of the envisaged equipment. My understanding is that
  "cryptologic process" only means the encryption algorithm, but not the
  secret key.

  The "loi 90-1170 du 29 decembre 1990" states that export *OR USE*
  of encryption means must be
  - previously declared when used only for authentication
  - previously authorized by the Prime minister in all other cases
  The fines go up to 500 000F (about $100,000) and three months
  in jail.

  The French law is much more restrictive than in the US, since I think
  it legal (up to now!) in the US to use encryption without prior
  authorization from the government. However the French law does not
  seem to be enforced at all.
> ... text deleted

Import of encryption *equipment* (not encrypted data) is prohibited by
the "decret du 18 avril 1939", art. 11. However the "loi du 29 dec 1990"
only restricts use or export, not import. There are no restrictions
on import of encrypted data.

Smooth move. In aid of catching a few tactical-level drug peddlers too
stupid to use their phones carefully, they are permitting rich industrial
competitors (including not only the Japanese but also each other--the French
are well known for industrial espionage against non-French) with computer
power to read their commercial cell phone traffic.

If one attributes intelligence, rather than bureaucratic stupidity, to this
action, then law enforcement must assume few criminals will be so stupid as
to use their phones "openly" for illegal acts. Thus it becomes an attempt to
deny them the use of secure phones rather than an attempt to listen in on
conversations which would (except for some stupid criminals) be valueless.

If so it means enforcement bureaucracy thinks denying criminals the use of
secure phones is worth the risk of denying legitimate business the use of
secure phones in an environment where rich competitors can tap the "less
secure" phones.

If not, it's just plain stupidity since they are exposing major business to
foreign competitive espionage which can cost their country hundreds of
millions in a world of economic warfare, for a trivial gain in being able to
hear the conversations of those few druggies stupid enough to talk openly,
knowing they can be overheard.

In either case, I despair for the sanity of governments.

Knowing how the bureaucratic mind works, this will also be used as an
argument for keeping something similar in the U.S., if and when the Clinton
administration revisits this subject.

Of course, the risk of a trap door has never been completely
negated.  However, notable experts disagree with you about the
cost of a brute-force attack.  Dr. Hellman (see my previous post)
maintains that it costs between $10 and $100 to break a DES key
by brute force (if you can afford the $1M to $10M startup costs,
and if you keep the DES-breaking machine continuously busy).

Dr. Ron Rivest (the "R" in RSA) also gave a talk where he showed
the following:

          DATE
BUDGET       | 1993   2003   2013
      -------|------|------|------
      $25K   | 47   | 52   | 57
      -------|------|------|-----
      $25M   | 60   | 65   | 70
      -------|------|------|-----
      $25G   | 73   | 78   | 83

The cells represent the bit-size of the largest key that an
organization with a certain-size budget could afford to break
by brute force.  It was assumed that decryption times would be
about the same as for DES.  Thus, a small country, a drug cartel,
or anyone else with $25M to spend could afford to brute-force
attack DES (which has 56 bits - less than 60).

Interestingly enough, exportable crypto implementations (40 key-
bits or less) can be broken by the local cops, a group of grad
students, or anyone else with $25K to spend.

The French equivalent of NSA has made it public that they consider
it their duty to spy on American firms and give the data to French
firms.  They could afford the $25G.

He made a similar table for RSA keys:

          DATE
BUDGET       | 1993   2003   2013
      -------|------|------|------
      $25K   | 400  | 450  | 550
      -------|------|------|-----
      $25M   | 600  | 700  | 850
      -------|------|------|-----
      $25G   | 900  | 1050 | 1200

So, 512-bit RSA keys aren't looking so great anymore.  1024-bit
keys seem barely adequate in this light.  2K- to 3K-bit RSA keys
seem prudent to protect any data that you are seriously
concerned might be attacked by a big-budget ($25G) enemy.

Despite what Peter said above, $25G programs are not easy to start
or stop, witness the AIDS research effort.  That effort is still
ramping up and, despite the great political pressure, already has
more money appropriated than can be wisely spent.  That situation
is much like the defense buildup in the early 80's.  More dollars
than sense.  A group with $25G to spend would have the same problem,
years and years before a solution would be available.  With that
level of funding, mathematicians would have to be trained and
algorithms developed.  There would also need to be a period for
ramping down of the effort and the money to pay for it.  The
result of the effort would likely eliminate RSA (or DES or whatever)
as an encruption technique. In all of its years of existance, it is
unlikely that NSA has spent more than $50G or $60G on this problem,
though that is only a guess on my part.  They have got lots of other
irons in the fire, and so do the French, and so does the medical
community.
Also, regarding the French Intelligence Service, my understanding from
newspapers is that if they come across something in the pursuit of their
mission that would be useful to their industrial service, they will
share the information with them.  Industrial intelligence is not a
primary mission.

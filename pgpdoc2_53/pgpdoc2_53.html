<H2>Compromised pass phrase and secret key</H2>
<P>Probably the simplest attack is if you leave your pass phrase for
your secret key written down somewhere.  If someone gets it and also
gets your secret key file, they can read your messages and make
signatures in your name.  
<P>Don't use obvious passwords that can be easily guessed, such as the
names of your kids or spouse.  If you make your pass phrase a single
word, it can be easily guessed by having a computer try all the words
in the dictionary until it finds your password.  That's why a pass
phrase is so much better than a password.  A more sophisticated
attacker may have his computer scan a book of famous quotations to
find your pass phrase.  An easy to remember but hard to guess pass
phrase can be easily constructed by some creatively nonsensical
sayings or very obscure literary quotes.

  Keys from Disclosure"</A>

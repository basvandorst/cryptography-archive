The attached language files, "language.txt" and "gb.hlp" are
intended for the use of those who, like us, dislike the
appearance of American spelling on their screens.

Simply follow the instructions given in the PGP file "setup.doc"
which are clarified here for those who are unsure.

The existing "language.txt" file in your PGP directory should be
deleted or re-named.

Add the enclosed files "gb.hlp" "language.txt" to your PGP 
directory. This should be the directory indicated by your PGPPATH 
statement.

Modify your "config.txt" (or "pgp.ini") file as follows:
change the line which says "Language = en" to read "Language = gb"
Leave out the quotation marks, and ensure that there are no
additional characters in this line. Next time you use PGP, it
should reply in "proper" English and "armour" your files as before!

This file is intended for use with PGP 2.6.3i. There is no reason
why it should not work with a DUSA compiled version of PGP 2.6.3.
It has also been tested with some earlier versions of PGP.

Enjoy,

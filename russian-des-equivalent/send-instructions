	tar -covf russian-des.tar russian-des

this will produce a tar file entitled `russian-des.tar' of
approximately 82K bytes.  Now type:

	compress russian-des.tar

34K bytes.  Finally type:

	uuencode russian-des.tar.Z russian-des.tar.Z > russian-des.tar.Z.uuenc

which will produce the file `russian-des.tar.Z.uuenc' of about 47K

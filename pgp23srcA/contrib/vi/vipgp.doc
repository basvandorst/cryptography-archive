Here are some vi macros, you can use these to encrypt, sign, decrypt or
view PGP messages from vi.  They are all invoked by typing Ctrl-X followed
by one of the letters e,s,d or v.  The encrypt/sign macros work from
the current cursor position to the end of the file, for the decrypt/sign
macros you should position the cursor before the PGP armored block you
want to decrypt/view.

If the PGP command fails, for instance because you typed the wrong userid
for encryption, you should type u when you're back in vi to undo the change.

These macros should be added to your .exrc file.  If you don't have a .exrc
file, you can create one by typing:

echo $EXINIT >$HOME/.exrc

You should also make sure that the EXINIT environment variable isn't set
in your shell startup file (.profile .login .cshrc etc.).

The macros can be used with [t]csh and Bourne-type shells, the latter don't
need the /bin/sh -c '..' wrapper.

Here is another macro, only useful if you use MH.  You can use it to
include an encrypted message you are replying to.

COMPUTER VIRUSES:  WHAT CAN USERS DO TO PROTECT THEIR COMPUTER
SYSTEMS
Although computer viruses have been around for a long time, the
widely publicized Michelangelo and Friday the 13th viruses, which
threatened computers worldwide this past March, refocused
attention on the problem of computer viruses.  Fortunately,
intense media coverage coupled with the use of anti-viral
software limited the loss of data and information to a few
isolated incidents.  

One beneficial result of these recent virus episodes is an
increased awareness among government, industry, academia, and
personal computer users of the dangers posed by computer viruses. 
Faced with the realization that viruses will continue to
proliferate in networks and systems for the foreseeable future,
users recognize the importance of taking preventive measures to
avert a virus attack or to limit its damage.  

What Can Be Done
Personal computer users can attain some degree of protection
against the threat of computer viruses by frequent and consistent
use of the following cost-effective measures:

o Back up data onto floppy disks and store in a protected place;

o Use only licensed copies of vendor software;

o Purchase software from known, reputable sources;

o Install only software which is clearly required;

o Minimize software sharing within the organization;

o Prohibit users from using software or disks from their home
systems;

o Use a special isolated system for downloading public-domain
software and shareware so that it may be tested by anti-viral
software prior to release for use by others;

o Use the latest anti-viral software available to test your hard
disk and floppy disks on a regular basis; 

o Do not leave a personal computer running but unattended; and

o Lock your computer with a hardware lock, if possible.  At day's
end, shut down and lock your computer, then lock your office
door.

CSL Resources Can Help

o Computer Security Bulletin Board System (BBS).  We maintain an
electronic BBS on computer security which provides a wealth of
information on viruses including publications, papers, software
reviews, and VIRUS-L, a moderated mailing list with approximately
1600 direct subscribers worldwide.  The mailing list is dedicated
to information about computer viruses on personal computers,
including Macintosh, PC, Amiga, and Apple, as well as others. 
VIRUS-L is an e-mail forum for Internet users that generally
includes useful information such as references to repositories of
anti-virus software, publications, and other items.

Accessing the BBS requires a standard ASCII terminal or personal
computer with serial communications capability.  The terminal
must be set for the following communications parameters:  modem
baud rate 2400, 1200, or 300 - dial (301) 948-5717; modem baud
rate 9600 - dial (301) 948-5140.  Data bits:  8/with no parity or
7/even parity.  Stop bits:  1.

To access the BBS via the Internet, use the telnet command, for
example:  type 'telnet csrc.nist.gov' or 'telnet 129.6.54.11'. 
The log in account is 'bbs'; the password is 'bbs'(lower case).

After the "CONNECT" message is displayed, the system begins a
log-in dialogue.  Use your real name when you log on.  The BBS
provides you with on-line help and various menu choices.  Virus
information can be obtained from the Files section of the board
in either the Research, Resources, or Publications Directories.  

A personal computer user may download any file without
restriction.  The BBS is available 24 hours a day.  Each user has
a maximum time limit of 70 minutes a day, 60 minutes on one call.

o CSL Bulletin on Computer Virus Attacks, August 1990, discusses
computer viruses and related threats and presents some effective
preventive measures.  Call CSL Publications at (301) 975-2821 for
a complimentary copy of this bulletin.

o NIST Special Publication 500-166, Computer Viruses and Related
Threats:  A Management Guide, gives general guidance for managers
of computer systems and networks on addressing the
vulnerabilities most likely to be exploited by computer viruses
and related software.  Order from the Government Printing Office,
(202) 783-3238, order number SN003-003-02955-6, price $2.50.

FEDERAL INFORMATION PROCESSING STANDARDS (FIPS) ACTIVITIES
Twelve FIPS Withdrawn
The Federal Register of March 10, 1992, announced the withdrawal
of 12 FIPS.  The Secretary of Commerce approved the withdrawal of
the FIPS because the technical specifications which they adopt
are obsolete and are no longer supported by industry.  The 12
standards dealt with information interchange by means of magnetic
tape and flexible disk cartridges.  For a copy of the Federal
Register listing the withdrawn FIPS, call our FIPS office at
(301) 975-2816.

CSL Selects Test Method and Establishes Trial Validation Service
for FIPS 160, Programming Language C
CSL selected the Perennial ANSI C Validation Suite as the test
method to be used for testing C compilers for conformance to FIPS
160, Programming Language C.  Established in January 1992, the
trial validation service will be used to verify the accuracy and
completeness of the C validation procedures.  The trial service
will continue through September 1992.

To assess the suitability of the test method and validation
procedures, we are seeking the views of industry, the public, and
local governments.  Address your written comments to:  National
Institute of Standards and Technology, Computer Systems
Laboratory, ATTN:  C Test Service, Building 225, Room A266,
Gaithersburg, MD 20899.  The comment deadline is September 30,
1992.

For more information, contact Kathryn Miles on (301) 975-3156.

Nine New Telecommunications FIPS Issued
On April 2, 1992, the Secretary of Commerce approved nine new
standards on modems for data communications use on telephone-type
circuits, to be published as FIPS 162-170.  The new family of
FIPS replaces FIPS 133, 134-1, 135, and 136 (formerly designated
Federal Standards 1005A, 1006A, 1007 and 1008).  The newly
approved standards adopt selected portions of CCITT
(International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee)
modem recommendations:  V.22, V.22bis, V.26, V.26bis, V.27bis,
V.27ter, V.29, V.32, V.33, V.42, and V.42bis.

Effective September 15, 1992, the standards will facilitate
interoperability between telecommunication facilities and systems
of the federal government.  You may purchase copies of the new
FIPS, including the technical specifications, from the National
Technical Information Service (see address below).  For further
information, contact Robert M. Fenichel, National Communications
System, 701 South Court House Road, Arlington, VA 22204-2198,
telephone (301) 692-2124.

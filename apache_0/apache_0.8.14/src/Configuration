# Config file for the Apache httpd.

# There are three types of lines here:

# '#' comments, distinguished by having a '#' as the first non-blank character
#
# Lines which set a Make option --- these are simply copied into the Makefile
#
# Module selection lines, distinguished by having 'Module' at the front.
# These list the configured modules, in priority order (highest priority
# first).  They're down at the bottom.

# First, ordinary compile-time configuration.

# What to call the compiler:  For normal machines with ANSI compilers
# CC= cc
# For Suns or other non-ANSI platforms. Please make sure your gcc is
# 2.0 or later, as 1.40 seems to create bad code for the Sun 4.
CC= gcc

# CFLAGS, compile flags.

# If you want no reverse hostname resolution, use -DMINIMAL_DNS
# If you want to have more secure hostname resolution at the cost of some 
# performance, use -DMAXIMUM_DNS.
# If you want setting the xbit of a file to cause it to be treated as
# server-included HTML (unless it is a CGI script), say -DXBITHACK.  Note
# that this is a run-time option, per-directory, either way (via the XBITHACK
# command); this option only sets the default.

# [Some other former Apache compile-time options are now treated differently;
#  the virtual host code is always present; DBM auth is an optional module, and
#  may be configured out by changing the module config below, though it still
#  defaults in.  Note that this config file does not include DBM auth by
#  default --- configure it in below if you need it].

CFLAGS= -O2

# Place here any flags you may need upon linking, such as a flag to
# prevent dynamic linking (if desired)
LFLAGS= 

# Place here any extra libraries you may need to link to. 
# -lndbm is commonly required for DBM auth, if that is configured in.
EXTRA_LIBS=

# AUX_CFLAGS are system-specific control flags.
# NOTE: IF YOU DO NOT CHOOSE ONE OF THESE, EDIT httpd.h AND CHOOSE
# SETTINGS FOR THE SYSTEM FLAGS. IF YOU DON'T, BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN.

# Module configuration
#
# Modules are listed in reverse priority order --- the ones that come
# later can override the behavior of those that come earlier.  This
# can have visible effects; for instance, if UserDir followed Alias,
# you couldn't alias out a particular user's home directory.

# Basic modules (i.e., generally useful stuff that works everyplace):

Module mime_module         mod_mime.o
Module access_module       mod_access.o
Module auth_module         mod_auth.o
Module negotiation_module  mod_negotiation.o
Module includes_module     mod_include.o
Module dir_module          mod_dir.o
Module cgi_module          mod_cgi.o
Module userdir_module      mod_userdir.o
Module alias_module        mod_alias.o
Module common_log_module   mod_log_common.o

# Modules which implement Apache extensions:
# These can be commented out if you don't want them
# (or don't have the decade-old "new" DBM libs).

Module asis_module        mod_asis.o
Module imap_module        mod_imap.o
# Module dbm_auth_module  mod_auth_dbm.o

# Optional modules for *full* NCSA compatibility --- we think these log
# files are a bad idea, but reasonable people seem to disagree:

# Module agent_log_module    mod_log_agent.o
# Module referer_log_module  mod_log_referer.o

# Finally, outright experiments --- mod_dld defines commands which
# allows other modules to be loaded in at runtime, and mod_cookies
# uses Netscape cookies to automatically construct and log accurate
# click-trails from Netscape cookies, for Netscape-using clients who
# aren't coming in via proxy.

# Module dld_module     mod_dld.o
# Module cookies_module mod_cookies.o

# Finally, this is a *replacement* for mod_log_common which 
# supports a LogFormat directive which allows you to specify what
# goes into the TransferLog (if you want Referer, etc.) --- see the
# source code for docs.  It is likely that something like this will
# be the default logger in a future release, but this is very much
# an experimental piece of code, and the syntax, etc., are still
# up for grabs.
#
# If you play with this, remember to drop the standard
# mod_log_common --- a server with both will work, but you'll get
# very confused trying to figure out what's going on...

# Module config_log_module mod_log_config.o

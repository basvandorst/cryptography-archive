1. Make SSL work with CGI (if it doesn't already, I suspect it does).

2. Make client certificate authorization possible independently of standard
HTTP authorisation, or in combination.

3. Make client certificate authentication more flexible - for example, per
directory configuration of acceptable CAs.

3. Improve logging. A lot.

4. Make writes buffered.

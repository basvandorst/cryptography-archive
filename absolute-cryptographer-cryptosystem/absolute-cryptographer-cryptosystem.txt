          "AC" - ABSOLUTE CRYPTOGRAPHER   -  
   A NEW CRYPTOGRAPHIC METHOD  AND  SOFTWARE SYSTEM

This cryptosystem is protected by patent of Malta Form E Warrant No 1082.
Patent has been published on October, 15-th, 1991 with priority date
March 26-th, 1991.

We would like to present below fragment of the patent description that
contents the main idea of the method and brief description of the software
implementation of the method that has been recently designed.
 
We will appreciate, if dear colleagues could find time for reviewing of
the method and for all remarks and suggestions.
     
Method consists of the next. The information to be (by text of the patent)
"transmitted is codified by eight-positional binary code (one
byte long code), then this byte is identified with  the  vector
of  values  (  at  all  sets  of  variable  values  )  of   the
corresponding Boolean function of three  variables.  Then  this
function brings the parametrical  vector  ,  composed  of  four
components (weights), that take the  values  in  Complex  Number
Field, in conformity. Such  a  vector  may  be  found  for  any
Boolean function of three variables, and, accordingly, for  any
eight-positional binary code." This fact has been prooved and
published in, i.g. Aizenberg I.N. "The Universal Logical Element 
over the Complex Number Field", "Cybernetics", 1991, No 3 (in
Russian). "Besides that any Boolean  function and, accordingly, 
eight-positional  binary  code  can  have  an infinite number of 
parametrical vectors.( Identification of any eight-positional  
binary code  with  the  values  vector  of  a certain Boolean function 
of three variables  is  rightful,  for this vector represents  binary  
vector  of  the  length  8  and different Boolean functions of  three  
variables,  as  well  as there exists exactly 256 binary codes of the 
length 8).
     Parametrical   vector,   corresponding   to   the    given
eight-positional] code,  is  transmitted  by  the  communication
channel, and  at  the  receiving  side  the  message  is  being
monosemantically restored by this parametrical vector with  the
help of the key.
     The key, with the help of which the transmitted message is
restored at the receiving side  has  the  following  structure.
Restoration of the message in this case consists in restoration
of eight-positional binary code and, thus, the message  itself,
by parametrical complex-valued vector.To restore binary code it
is necessary to restore values vector of the  corresponding  to
this code Boolean function at all sets of  variable  values  by
parametrical vector. It is done as follows. Let us assume  that
(W0, W1, W2, W3 ) - parametrical vector (code) of  binary  code
f =  (f0, f1, f2, ...,f7) ( f(i) from {0,1}, i  =  0,1,...,7 );
(x1,x2,x3) -  set of Boolean variables.  We  should  note  that
here in after Boolean functions take values in binary  alphabet
{1,-1}, and not in {0,1}, 1 corresponding  to the zero, and  -1
corresponding to the 1. At every set  of  values  of  Boolean
variables  ,  starting  from  (1,1,1);(1,1,-1)  and  ending  by
(-1,-1,-1) there is  the  value  of  weighting  sums  of  these
variables ( all in all there will be 8 such sums):
         Z  = W0 + W1*X1 + W2*X2 + W3*X3, i = 0,1,...,7."
     Then the value of key-function is calculated for every Z ,
that is determined by the some non-linear transformation that performs
Z to the value of the function f: P(Z) = f. 
    "Thus, the essence of the proposed key is the fact that any
Boolean function of  three  variables  may  be  represented  by
parametrical vector (W0, W1, W2, W3), all W  in  general  being 
complex numbers. every function can have an infinite number  of
parametrical vectors.The function, i.e. its  vector  of  values
(eight-positional binary code ) is being restored at  all  sets
of values of variables  according to the following law :
   P(Z) = P(w0 + w1*x1  + w2*x2  + w3*x3 ) = f(x1,x2,x3).
     While putting this method into practice, the cipher of every
eight-positional binary code can be  changed  every  time  this
code  is  repeated  (for  there  is  an  infinite   number   of
parametrical vectors for every code) without  any  coordination  
with  the  receiving side."
     In order to guarantee defense from non-sanctioned access
to the enciphered information even in case when  the the key of the method  
become  known,  one  should  modify  the definition of the key 
(modify key-function P(Z) ) by some coordinated time law.
     It should be noted that the  described  encryption  method
can be used not only with the binary  code  words  of  the
length 8, but  with  the  codes  with  greater  length,  16,for
example. In this case the corresponding  16-positional   binary
code is  identified  with  the  value  vector  of  the  Boolean
function of four variables, that is described by  5-dimensional
complex-valued vector-cipher (W0,W1,W2,W3,W4). This  cipher  is
transmitted by communication channel, and at the receiving side
the  information  is  being   restored   with   the   help   of
key-function.
 Subject of the invention (according to the text of the patent):
    "Having now  particularly  described  and  ascertained  the
nature of our said invention and in what manner the same is  to
be performed  we declare that what we claim  is   METHOD  TO
ENCRYPT  INFORMATION  ,  the  essence  of  which  consists   in
codifying information by 8-positional binary codes,  which  are
enciphered  then  at  the  transmitting  side,  transmitted  by
communication  channel  and   deciphered   at   the   receiving
side,differing in  the   fact   that   in   order   to    avoid
non-sanctioned  access  this  8-positional  binary  code   is
identified with the values vector of the Boolean function of  3
variables, that is described  by  4-dimensional  complex-valued
vector-cipher (each Boolean function has an infinite number  of
such   vector-ciphers);   this   cipher   is   transmitted   by
communication  channel,  and  at  the   receiving   side   this
8-positional binary code   and  the  corresponding  message  is
monosemantically restored by vector-cipher with the help of the
key-function.  Besides  that,  at  the   receiving   side   the
key-function can be changed by coordinated time  law,  and  the
same happens with the vector-ciphers at the transmitting side."

    Recently we designed software implementation of the method
that has been described above in the text of our patent. But
algorithm that implemented by software "ABSOLUTE CRYPTOGRAPHER" (AC)
has some features.
1.Firstly information that has be encrypted (one or more files)
is compressed by original method in 3-4 times.
2.Compressed information is encrypted by method that described
in the text of the patent with some changes : 2a. Addition is  
non-associative operation ( (a+b)+c<>a+(b+c) ). This property
is possible, if addition is defined by some special way. All weights 
(parameters) of the Boolean functions of 3 variables are represented by 
their arguments only which are integer numbers and have constant amplitudes, 
and addition is reduced to addition of the integer numbers with shifting. 
2b. Changing of the key-function P(Z) is doing before encryption 
of the each byte of the encrypting sequence. Law of such an changing
is determined by the password (key) which has be defined by
user and consists of 1024 or less symbols (one can write this
password-key to file in advance or type it on the keyboard) and based
on the evaluation of linear combination of the codes of password symbols.
User has absolutely freedom in the choosing of the key-password sequence.
3.According to the fact that each Boolean function has infinite 
number of the parametrical vectors (weights) that represented it,
each version of the software AC has individual set of the basic
parametrical vectors which never can be obtained one from other
because there are generated by the so complete operation with random
numbers. It is possible to generate 2**32 different variants of the
basic parametrical vectors. Therefore, information that has been
encrypted by one version of the AC never can be decrypted by 
another one.

>From our point of view the main advantages of method "AC" in comparison 
with popular method DES are the next.
1. In DES all information are encrypted with the same key, it means, the key
does not change for each portion of encrypted information. And so,
if cryptoanalyst can decrypt even minimum part of encrypted information, 
it will be easy to recognize the key and correspondingly one will
be able to decrypt all information right away because the key does not change.
There is no key as such in method "ABSOLUTE CRYPTOGRAPHER". It (more exact 
they) is calculated according to the password which determined
by user. The password has 1024 symbols long. 512 keys are automatically
calculated according to this password and each new byte from encrypted 
consistency is encrypted with new key. And so, even in the case of decryption 
of portion of encrypted information using some methods (this is absolutely
incredibility, see below), as distinct from DES  will not help to
decrypt the other part of encrypted information. Because only each 
512-th byte will be decrypted correctly in the case of finding one of the 512
keys. If we will suppose that somebody will do attempt to find key-password
sequence, it will be necessary for him to sort not less than 
(26+26+10+10)**1024 = 72**1024 variants (26-number of large English letters,
26-number of small English letters 10 - number of digits and 10 -
number of special symbols which are on the same keys that digits, if we 
suppose that key-password consists only from these symbols). One may 
compare such sorting with sorting of the 2**64 variants for finding of the 
key in DES. 2**64 is rather great number, but 72**1024 (this is approximately
2**7000) makes any sorting absolutely impossible. We think that such
property makes a good protection of information even of authors of method
and software "AC".
2.Method "AC" is absolutely staying-power of any cryptoanalytical
and statistical analysis. Two complete non-linear transformations of
information (compressing and encryption) makes statistical analysis
of the cipher absolutely impossible. This quality is guaranteed by
two complete non-linear transformations that convert input information
to the coefficients of the equations of non-linear surfaces fragments
in the 3-dimensional Complex space. If one use 1024 symbols in the 
key-password, 512 different equations of such surfaces fragments exists.
Correlation between border coefficients, groups of the coefficients,
including groups corresponded to the same byte in the input sequence
is equal to zero as a rule (or closer to zero).
3.Another advantage of the method "AC" is in fact that this method is
stream method (each byte of the input information encrypted independently
using different keys). Therefore it is impossible to restore all keys by
fragment of the key-password and cipher has higher protection from errors 
(errors in the communication line involve incorrect encryption only of 
separated bytes) in comparison with block methods.

Algorithm AC can easy be implemented in hardware because there are only 
simple operations with integer numbers (adding and shifting) in it.

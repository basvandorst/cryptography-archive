I just got these figures from our chief vocoder person. He says he's
already talked about them externally, so I can relate them here.

The vocoder produces a data frame every 20 milliseconds, but the
amount of data in each frame varies according to speech activity.
This lets us gain a factor of about two in overall system capacity.
(This is something much more easily done in a spread spectrum multiple
access system than in a TDMA system with fixed timeslot assignments.)

There are four possible frame sizes:
	
rate		net vocoder frame size		total on-air frame size,
						with overhead

full rate	160 bits + 11 bits of FEC	24 bytes
half rate	80 bits				12 bytes
quarter rate	40 bits				6 bytes
eighth rate	20 bits				3 bytes

So the total on-air data rates, including overhead, are 9600, 4800,
2400 and 1200 bps. Only the full rate frame has the extra 11
bits/frame of FEC.

The vocoder runs on an AT&T DSP-16 chip with a capacity of about 20
MIPS.  At full rate, the vocoder code consumes roughly 18 MIPS, or
almost all of this chip's capacity.

From observing the system in operation, the vocoder spends most of its
time at either full rate (when you're talking) or eighth rate (when
you're not). It spends relatively little time at the intermediate
rates.

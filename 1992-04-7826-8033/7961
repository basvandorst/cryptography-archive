CALL FOR DISCUSSION: COMP.COMPRESSION.THEORY
============================================
It is proposed that a new newsgroup be created:

   Name    : comp.compression.theory
   Charter : Discussions about data compression algorithms.
   Status  : Unmoderated.

Many researchers have stopped reading comp.compression because of the
volume of non-research traffic (e.g. postings with subject fields such
as "Where can I get Unix compress for MSDOS?"). There is now a strong
need for a newsgroup that can provide a forum for more theoretical
discusions about data compression and data compression algorithms.
Such a newsgroup would assist those who are actually involved in
understanding and developing new algorithms as opposed to merely using
them.

The suffix ".theory" is designed to scare off those who want to
discuss specific computer programs. The term "algorithms" in the
charter is designed to lure back those who got so scared that they
decided it must be a newsgroup for information theorists. It is
intended that the scope of the newsgroup range from information theory
to practical algorithm construction, but no further.

Timetable
---------
Tue 14-Apr-1992 Call for discussion (deadline for agreement 14-May-1992).
Tue 28-Apr-1992 Call for votes.
Thu 21-May-1992 Last day on which votes will be received.
Fri 22-May-1992 Posting of vote tally. 5 day waiting period.
Thu 28-May-1992 Creation of comp.compression.theory.

In accordance with the guidelines for newgroup creation, discussion
about the creation of this newsgroup will take place in "news.groups".

I am sending this message to a few key newsgroups and also to all
those who voted in the comp.compression vote about one year ago. I
urge you to support this proposal which has the potential to
significantly assist data compression researchers around the world.

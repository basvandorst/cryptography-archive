Ah --- so it is a theorem after all (modulo the (p,2p+1) conjecture),
though a much harder and less familiar one than Dirichlet's on primes
in arithmetic progressions.

I was going to ask for more information about this last phrase, since
I was not aware that Artin's conjecture had been proved.  Since then
you have explained that you were referring to H-B's proof that Artin's
conjecture [that any positive integer k which is not a perfect r-th
power for some r>1 is a primitive residue of infinitely many primes;
sometimes one sees the special case k=2 referred to as "Artin's conjecture"]
holds for all but at most two k.  That may be a milestone in analytic
number theory (I say "may" because I'm not sufficiently familiar with
the state of the art of analytic number theory and with H-B's proof
to judge myself), but it's still not what I'd consider a proof of
Artin's conjecture, since we don't yet have a single k for which
the conjecture is known to be true --- in particular even k=2 is not
yet settled.

I belive that Whitehead showed (shewed) that (primes less than n that are
congruent to 1 mod 4) - (primes less than n that are congruent to 3 mod 4)
has infinitely many zeroes and then went on to show that the smallest one
was (upper) bounded by some ridiculously unhelpful integer.  Later, other
work was done to reduce the bound to something merely useless...  :-)

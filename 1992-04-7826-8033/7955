How many people out there are writing RSAREF-based Privacy-Enhanced
Mail programs to be placed in the public domain?

I have been planning on writing such a beast since the RSAREF beta
test period, but I haven't had the time until now.  In the meantime,
I figure it's pretty likely that several others have started similar
projects.  I'm eying my long list of potential personal projects,
and wondering whether I'd be duplicating effort if I were to start
work on an RSAREF-based PEM program now that I've waited so long.

So, if you're working on an public domain RSAREF-based PEM program,
please speak up.  Not only would you help me plan my life for the
next few months, but you may benefit from other developers who
also speak up.  A PEM development project would surely stand to 
benefit from interchange amoungst developers.

i think that this can be done in software as well.


certainly, if you use an fft based system, then a sparc or similar
workstation can handle the handle the load.  i recently saw a demo of
bbn speech recognition system which did connected speech recognition
in near real time on a personal iris with no special hardware other
than the a/d that comes with the system.

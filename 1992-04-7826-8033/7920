Assume I had a fast, simple and "secure" encryption algorithm, can I
somewhere, somehow "try this out"? I.e. send an encrypted file
to some pattern research/cryptology place, and ask them to decrypt it,
back to whatever it was before (plain textfiles) encrypting it.
 
I, who created it, can't in no way figure out how it could be done, but
I want some independant, professional people to tell if it is.
 
Interested people/companies: Send me textfiles, and I will encrypt
                             them and send them back (uu-encoded).
                             Of course I will use the same key for all
                             your files, so you have One chance of making
                             it (don't ask me how though).
 
Sceptics; No, it's not a (key) == (length_of_file) "algorithm".
It uses "normal" keys in special ways.

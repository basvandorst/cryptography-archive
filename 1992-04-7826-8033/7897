   Is someone trying to get USENET blasted out of existance?

It's "existence."

   Export of
   encryption software is forbidden in this country.  If any site is
   feeding comp.sources.misc to a site outside the country (USA), then
   they are now in more violation of more federal laws than you can shake
   a stick at.

1) The software was posted by someone from Australia.  It was approved
by a moderator in the United Kingdom.  Considered that I don't think
anyone has *ever* been put on trial, or even charged, for exporting
DES software from the United States, do you *really* think the US
government is going to try to prosecute a USENET site for
automatically feeding a measly DES encryption library that was already
available on archive sites all over the world?  Yeah, right.

2) I suspect that *one* law is being broken.  *One*, not "more federal
laws than you can shake a stick at."  Misplaced hyperbole does nothing
to strengthen your argument.  I don't suppose you can cite all of
those laws you're worried about breaking?

   Between this and the posting of copyrighted pictures in
   the alt.binaries.pictures groups, I will be surprised if USENET is
   still around by the end of the year.

"Imminent death of the USENET predicted.  Film at 11."

The Banach-Tarski "paradox" (paradox in quotes because it's no paradox,
just very counter-intuitive): A solid sphere can be divided into four
pieces that can then be reassembled into *two* spheres, each as large
as the original sphere.

Before you start yelling "but that's impossible", let me add that the
pieces must of course be non-measurable, i.e. of so contorted shape
that they cannot be assigned a volume. This means that you can't do it
with material spheres (they can't be divided finely enough), and you
need the axiom of choice to prove the theorem.

Now is it, really? Some people would argue that we have *less*
possibility of choosing our mathematical theories at will than in
physics - in physics, there are always things we can't observe, and we
can have many theories that produce the same results for all
experiments done up to date, but mathematical theories are designed to
account completely for a field. (Please don't lecture me about
Goedel's theorem, I know that what I just described is utopic. But it
is what mathematicians aim at.)

I did a port of it a few months back, and had everything working except
the compression, I think.  It wasn't really that difficult to get it to
a working state; I think there were a couple instances of assuming
sizeof(short) == sizeof(int) and dereferencing NULL pointers.  The port
I did still needs some work; things like the prompts for input use
busy-loops polling the keyboard.  If anyone did a thorough port, I'd
like to hear about it as well.

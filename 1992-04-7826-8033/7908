:May I ask what variant of FFT you are using for your multiplies???


I am using the FFTs from IBM's Engineering and Scientific Subroutine
Library (ESSL/6000). I understand that these were written - at least in
part - by Jim Cooley himself, and they are reputed to be some of the world's
best FFTs. I know that my program spends nearly half of the time not in the
FFTs but in three lines of code that do nothing but convert from integer to
floating point and vice versa. This could be substantially improved by
manual recoding of the conversion routines, but I have not found the time
to do so.

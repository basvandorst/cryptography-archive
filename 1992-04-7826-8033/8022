:I'm wondering what are 'good' primes. In [Rosen] reads:
 
In actuality, there is no such thing as 'good' primes. There are, however,
a VERY sparse set of 'bad' primes. [e.g. primes of the form n!+1, for example]

:	1)  p-1 and q-1 should have large prime factors.
 
The Elliptic Curve algorithm has made this requirement worthless.

:	    (They have a factor of two, but no other factors among
: 	     the first 1000 primes?)
 
Irrelevent.

:	2)  The greatest commond divisor of p-1 and q-1 should be small.
 
This too is really unnecessary for even moderate sized primes. The reason
for it originally was to prevent birthday type attacks via looking for
fixed points.

:	3)  p and q should have decimal expansions differing in length
:	    by a few digits.
 
For primes greater than 50 digits, this is TOTALLY unnecessary. The reason
for this 'rule' was to prevent difference-of-squares type attacks, but
the complexity of such attacks for 50 digit primes makes it totally
unnecessary.

:Are these bounds sufficient, should I use more digits/primes/etc?
 
They are sufficient, but none of them are really necessary. Just choose
two large primes at random near (say) 100 digits. Too much is made about
'good' primes.

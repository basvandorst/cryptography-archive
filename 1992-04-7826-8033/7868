If the experience of various members of the US committee that wrote
the standard for security and "privacy" in digital cellular telephones
is any guide, to pass the NSA's muster for exportability you have to
make your algorithm so weak as to be virtually useless.

For example, in the aforementioned digital cellular standard, voice
"privacy" consists of generating a fixed "bit mask" as a byproduct of
the authentication process and simply XORing it with each frame of
vocoder data before transmission. The data is "decrypted" by again
XORing it with the same mask at the receiver.  The mask remains fixed
for the entire duration of the call.

Yes, I know this is April 1st, but this is not a joke. I wish it were.

The moral of this story is that you'll never be able to depend on a
communications vendor to provide you with meaningful privacy. You'll
have to do it for yourself.

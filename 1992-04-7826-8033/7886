Now that you mention it...

I've heard about a group at IBM working on physically secure coprocessors.
They wrap a processor card in really really fine wires and dip it in epoxy.
If any of the wires are disturbed, the chip erases its secure memory.

They actually talk about attacks such as a gang of watchmakers with magnifying
glasses scraping away the epoxy, or using shaped explosive charges to "punch
out" the erasure hardware before it can zap the secure memory....

These guys sound nuts.  I like them already.

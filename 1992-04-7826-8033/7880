Just passing through this group, but can't resist...this is a joke, 
right???

If not joke, ask a colleague what "lagged correlations" means.  You'll 
find them very helpful.

PS & BTW, I have from time to time used paper and pencil and / or SPSS 
to break the simple mono and polyalphabetic ciphers that used to be 
published in the London Times and other newspapers in late Victorian 
times.  Assorted love notes, typically.  Anyway, the techniques are 
absurdly simple and you'd be wasting your money to pay for them (again, 
if this is not a joke).

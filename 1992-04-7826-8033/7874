We are looking for algorithms to solve simple substitution ciphers,
hopefully looking at character, di-gram, and tri-gram frequencies.

Anything either commercial or research would be helpfull.  Alternately,
if anyone has expertise in this area, maybe a few hours of consulting
work would be in possible to explain the problem and solutions to us.

Any leads would be greatly appreciated.

What's the status of non-NSA crypto research in the United States these
days?  I read a book on the NSA ("The Puzzle Palace") that was published
about ten years ago, wherein was recounted, among other things, the
conflict between the NSA and independent academic researchers, and NSA's
wish to be able to control this research.  I heard something along the
lines that in the beginning of the Reagan administration a muzzle was in
fact put on the academic community.  Can anyone confirm this, correct
me, or provide more details?

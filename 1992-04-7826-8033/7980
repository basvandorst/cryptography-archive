Hello, all.
Please execuse me if this is an FAQ.
Is there any license control program for PC-DOS that can control a software
can only run the specific PC? It will be great if it can also include other
feature like expiration date, etc. I know there are some license servers
for Unix environment, but how about pc-dos?
Thanks in advance for your information. Please e-mail me as I don't have
access to this news-group. I'll summarize if I get enough help.

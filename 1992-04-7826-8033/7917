I did not claim that there were an infinite number of p such that 
p and 2p+1 were both prime. Merely that IF p and 2p+1 are both prime
then it divides 2^p-1 with probability 1/2 and 2^p+1 with probability
1/2. It must divide one or the other (Lagrange's theorem) and divides
on the minus side when 2 is a residue and on the plus side when it is
a non-residue.
 
Indeed, it is a well known oustanding conjecture that there ARE an
infinite number of such pairs, p and 2p+1 both prime.


An expert in sieve methods tells me that if one assumes
that there are an infinite number of p such that p and 2p+1 are both
prime, then it is possible to show that they must be correctly 
distributed mod 4. That it would violate some known results in sieve
methods if they were not. Since I am a novice to sieve methods
[I am just starting to learn what they are about] I don't know this for
myself. Apparently one looks at some Dirchlet character sums
Sum(x < N) chi(x) where chi(x) is the appropriate Dirchlet character mod 4.
One then follows through with Dirichlet's proof for primes in an arith.
prog. subject to the side condition that p and 2p+1 are both prime.
One applies a weighted sieve to the character sum and shows that it has
the right order of magnitude as N --> infty. 

I can follow the general gist of this argument [I've worked through
Dirichlet's proof], but don't know enough math to follow the details.

However, I'm learning!! [at least I hope I am]. It's fascinating stuff.
 
Apparently some of Heath-Brown's recent techniques that he developed
when he proved Artin's conjecture are relevent.

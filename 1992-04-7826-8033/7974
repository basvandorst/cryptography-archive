Boy, talk about misplaced anger.  TV Guide doesn't make money from the codes.
VCR+ makes the money by selling the devices!  VCR+ is therefore protective
of the algorithm.

TV Guide (and all the newspapers who carry the codes) actually PAY FOR
THE PRIVILEGE.  And VCR+ gets the money.  

So why do the listing services pony up big bucks for the codes?  Because
VCR+ has them convinced that if they don't, their competitors will.
And as long as any one listing service does use the codes, the rest are 
forced to fork over money for the codes.

What a racket.

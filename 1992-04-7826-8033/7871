I am looking for information about standardization of public key 
cryptosystems. 

I know that there exists draft proposals (ISO 9798-3:1990 and ISO 9799:1988) 
for use of public key cryptosystems in entity authentication
and standards (ISO 8732:1988, ISO 8731-2:1987 and ANSI x9.17-1985) 
for key management and message authentication.
But what is the level of standardization of methods of public key 
cryptosystems? I mean, does it exist any method compearable to DES
among public key cryptosystems? 

If there is a proposal for a PKC standard, what is the WI/DP/DIS/IS
code for it?

BTW, Could RSA, which is patented by Public Key Partners, even become
such a standard? 

Thank you,
           Mika

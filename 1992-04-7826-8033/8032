Popcount and leading zero count have lots of nice uses:

  Computing the least-significant one bit's position is simple
  with -, XOR, and leading zero count (count zeroes before most
  significant one).

  Doing any sort of work with error correction codes (parity,
  SECDED) is easier with popcount.

  Computing signum(x), C and pascal conditional values, and
  some simple primitives (e.g., abs(x), foo[b>4], x!=y, x==y)
  can be linear, no branch code.

  Dispatching events from a status register (where each bit
  corresponds to some action that needs to be taken) is straight-
  forward and can simplify some data structures somewhat.

  Some string operations in a word-addressible machine can be much
  simplified by judicious use of leading zero instructions.  (E.g.,
  finding a byte of zeroes in a sequence of words.)

And, finally, that most important use of all:
  Making Herman Rubin eternally grateful for helping his bit-stream
  codes run fast.  ;-)

NSA obviously has lots of interest in codes and ciphers.  Given
their similarity in some ways to ECCs, and NSA's interest in
commercial substitution codes that simulate various mechanical
devices, XOR, AND, ~, popcount, and other bit manipulating
operations would help them a great deal.

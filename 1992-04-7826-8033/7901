As the information in a random dot stereogram is stored in the disparities
between corresponding dots in the pair of images, isn't it necessary to
have the plain text in advance of constructing *both* images? This seems
to indicate that the `key' half is not in fact independent of the information 
to be securely transmitted and could therefore not be provided `in advance'.

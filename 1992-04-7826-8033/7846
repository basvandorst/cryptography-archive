Probabilistic arguments can give insight into a problem without giving
a rigorous proof.  

Here's a very crude probabilistic argument that suggests that there are
infinitely many Mersenne primes.

The prime number theorem says roughly that the probability that a number of
size N picked at random is a prime is 1/log(N).  Then, roughly, the 
probability that a Mersenne number 2^k - 1 is prime is 1/k (ignoring a factor
of 1/log(2) ).  So the expected number of Mersenne primes is Sum[1..inf] 1/k.
Of course, the harmonic series diverges.

The same kind of argument suggests that the number of Fermat primes, primes of
the form 2^(2^n) + 1, is finite.   The expected number would be roughly
Sum[1..inf] 1/2^n, which is finite.

I read the following in the newproducts group and I am obviously
missing something...  While the product sounds interesiting, and we
certainly have an application here where such a device would be very
nice indeed, I don't understand how the system is supposed to work.  The 
thing that confuses me is that the system proports to choose a new
network wide key every 7 seconds (from one of 2^64-1 possable)
RANDOMLY, but without passing any information over the network...  How
can this work?  Also, I wonder how the keys are stored, or rather
since I can't see how they could store such a huge number of keys
large enough to be used as one time pads, are they really xoring with
PSRNs?  Anyway, the thing sounded fishy to me just because if it is
that simple to syncronize security in real time over a reasonably
quick network why do we have all of these slow, complicated systems
like DES?  

Anyway, thanks for your help, and sorry if the questions are really
dumb--I'm quite new to all of this...

     Quinte Network Confidentiality Equipment Inc. (Quince), 70% owned
by Spanex Capital Inc.  of Toronto, has developed a security product
called "securcom" that users can insert between a computer and an
ethernet Local Area Network.  Securcom encrypts and decrypts traffic
to and from the computer in the appropriate way.  In practice it is
computationally infeasible to break the encryption.  The encryption is
an instance of the well-known one-time-pad.  Other commonly used types
of encryption are too slow and much too expensive.

     The encryption uses one of 2**64 distinct keys, each equally
probable.  The key is changed for every frame of data transmitted on
the network.  Successive keys will never overlap.  Each 7 seconds a
new key is simultaneously adopted by all of the securcoms on the
network.  Computers that join the network need wait only this 7
seconds to synchronize to the correct encryption key.

     The adoption of this new key does not involve transmitting the
key on the network at all.  The novel (patent applied for) key
management and distribution mechanism does not require any centralized
facility.  It is tolerant of the failure of a computer and is
insensitive to which computers are turned on or turned off.

     It is possible and desirable for system security officers to
define (static but changeable) security domains within which entirely
free communications can occur, but from and to which communications
with the "outside" can be done only through an intercommunications
guard device that is identified by the security officer and that he or
she programs to accept or reject traffic on a reasonable and
parameterized basis.

     The product will be commercially available in 3Q92 and will sell
for under US$600.  The intercommunications guard will appear in 4Q92
followed by a token ring version of "securcom" in 1Q93.  Follow-on
products are also planned.  Spanex Capital Inc. is a public company
whose shares are quoted on the Canadian Dealing Network Inc. under the
Ticker Symbol SPAX.

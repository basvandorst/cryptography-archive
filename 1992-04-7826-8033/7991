I know of one program that works this way, Personal Cadat (a logic
simulator) from Racal-Redac.  During installation, some hidden information
is placed on the hard disk, which the program checks for each time it is
run.  The installation is done from a copy protected (but not write
protected) floppy disk, so that only a fixed number of installations are
allowed.  

This system could probably be defeated given enough effort,
but so can any other copy-protection scheme.  Another problem is that
the user has no recourse from a hard disk crash, since the hidden information
cannot be backed up.  (Cadat makes an extra installation available for 
this purpose).

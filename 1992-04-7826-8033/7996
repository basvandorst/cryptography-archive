	I've passed this information on to Thomas in Germany and the
	interest in this book and a few others seems to be great enough to
	make it generally available.

	There are two very good dealers in the U.S. who specialize in old and
	out of print books on espionage etc. including crypto.  They usually
	have a copy of "Codebreakers" and other stuff in.  They'll also search
	for books they don't have on hand.  They will send books anywhere
	provided you pay costs.

What sort of bandwidth do you need now for digitised telephone-quality speech?
I had heard that the best techniques could get this down to a digital stream
of about 8Kbps (eg 1KByte per s); how much MFLOPS/MIPS does it take to encode
and decode.  Because encrypting 1KBps (not bps, note) string shouldn't be too
hard in real time.

Replies by e-mail, please, and I'll summarise.

Here's another trick that's been hanging around the fence:

Encode the information in the least significant bits of either
photographs or musical data. In fact you can use compression algorithms
like JPEG to determine what the "significant" bits are. Just compress
and see which areas of the photo are mapped into the same value. The
bits that used to distinguish the very subtle color shades in this region 
probably aren't that valuable. This way you can let all the compression
guys worry about psycho-physical thresholds. 

There is sooo much noise in the world just waiting to hold the secret
messages of the world.

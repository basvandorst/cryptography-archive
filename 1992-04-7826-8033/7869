You could try the NSEA algorithm from Peter Gutman. It was described here
some time ago and it is part of HPACK 0.75 if memory serves right (sources
available). NSEA is a Peter Gurman invention wo is from New Zealand which
makes it available in a legal way all over the world. 
Unfortunately this does NOT mean you can just export it from the US. You
could however try to get permission on basis that it is non-US and since
NSEA is available outside the US you could also considder letting out
the NSEA and let the user add it himself.
US crypto problems remain a problem.

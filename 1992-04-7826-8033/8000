What's the status of RSA these days?  Is it being standardized, and if
so, to what extent has the standardization process progressed?

Also, is the RSA still considered secure?  Have any kind of significant
vulnerabilities been uncovered in it since, say, 1988?  (I'm a student
of CS, currently attending a computer networks course with a section on
security.  The book we're using, that covers DES and RSA, among other
things, was published in 1989.)

This is a mutated signature virus, if you don't put it in your .sig
file you may lose your job, your dog may be run over, and you may die.
If you repent and add the .sig you may win the lottery and get laid.

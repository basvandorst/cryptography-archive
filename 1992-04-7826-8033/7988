There are two absolute requirements for any such solution:

1.	you need to know what computer you're on

2.	you need to know what copy of the software you have

and, if you want an expiration date,

3.	you need to know the date.

You need all of these things to be unforgeable.

As far as I know, (1) there is no unique identifier in PCs; (3) dates are
provided by a human user rather than by radio from some time standard; and
(2) most people asking this question want to be able to mass produce
software (eg, on CD-ROM) so that all copies are identical.

Can anyone see a chink in my logic?

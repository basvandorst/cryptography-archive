I remember, there was a discussion about US export restrictions and
crypt algorithms. A few days ago while I was at the Hannover Fair
CeBit '92 here in Germany, I spoke to a guy from Cryptech (Brussels/
Belguim). His company sells DES and RSA hardware (chips) and crypt
software all over the world. As we discussed the US export restrictions
he told me a sort of funny story:

Do you know, he asked me, why IBM Hong Kong is in our references list?
Because IBM USA cannot export DES. So IBM Hong Kong has to buy from us;
the Belgian Government allows the export in countries not involved in
war (except states like Lybia or Iraque, they don't get anything).
Everyone in the world knows the algorithm, but the US people are not
allowed to export them.

I thought that is sort of interesting to be known here in this group. :-)

BTW, the whole references list is interesting stuff to read.

Regards,

Claus.

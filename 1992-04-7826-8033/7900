It occurs to me that random-dot stereograms could be used for
transmitting small amounts of information securely.  The recipient
would be provided in advance with one half of the stereogram, and the
other half would be constructed when needed.  This is equivalent to a
one-time pad, with the advantages that

 (a) it can be decoded with no equipment in a few seconds
 (b) it can easily be used for transmitting diagrams as well as text.

Has this ever been done?

[A random-dot stereogram consists of two images of random dots.  The
two are identical except that some areas of dots are displaced slightly
in one of the images (and the resulting gap filled with more random dots).
If one image is viewed with each eye (which can be done by crossing your
eyes) the displaced areas are perceived as being at different distances.]

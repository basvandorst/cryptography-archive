This begs the question of how many people would actually *use* such a
thing. RSA seems to sell certificates only to big companies which don't
know any better; how many such companies do you think will grab code off
the net to incorporate into their own products? Conversely, the people
in the best position to actually *use* PEM at this point are the people
who see no reason to bow to RSA's extortion. Is there anyone reading
this who's actually bought a product-of-large-primes from RSA? Please
post the product if so---lots of people will be amazed.

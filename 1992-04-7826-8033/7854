Hmmmm, that's interesting. I guess for those who expect aesthetics and beauty
in mathematics as a `real force', then math intuition makes sense.

It would be interesting if anyone could think of some counterexamples
where intuition based on aesthetics fails.

(eg. some sequence or series that has a surprising counter-intuitive property).

I would expect to not come accross as many counter-intuitive examples
in maths as in physics.

Physics models the real world, which we have no control over, and so springs
lots of surprises at us.

However, maths is different. We control maths. Maths is a construct that is
a pure product of our minds.

We don't often do things like deliberately invent strange number systems  that
do weird things for the sake of it. [I'm sure we could if we wanted to].
Because we are driven by a desire for things to look elegant.


Derek.

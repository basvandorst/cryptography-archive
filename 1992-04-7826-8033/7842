I see two ready solutions:

1. Use ISDN data circuits for your encrypted voice (may not be available
   in all areas yet).

2. Use lower quality but readily available codecs such as CVSD at low speeds
   (or software simulations of same, operating off whatever builtin high-
   bit-rate coder you might have). Refer to the data sheet (18 pages) of
   the Motorola MC3517 & MC3518 CVSD codecs for an extensive discussion
   of CVSD and its various tradeoffs versus speed. While "toll quality"
   speech requires 32kb/s or higher (using, say, the MC3518 with its 4-bit
   algorithm), "communications/radio quality" (with higher noise and lower
   dynamic range) can be achieved at data rates as low as 8kb/s (with the
   MC3517's 3-bit algorithm).

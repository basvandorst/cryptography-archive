Although I think the idea of electronic cash is wonderful, I'm afraid
it will never get very far given the present worldwide drug hysteria.

Unlike the private use of cryptography, which no government will ever
be able to control, the success of cryptographic cash depends in large
part on governments formally recognizing it as legal tender.

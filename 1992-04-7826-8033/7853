Agreed. But I think it's important to get it out there ASAP, and to
get it used as widely as possible. Then voice privacy will be
politically impossible to control.

What I fear is that "civilian" secure phones will be used, at least
initially, by those with the most to fear from FBI wiretaps, ie., real
criminals. If this happens before they become widespread among
legitimate users, then the FBI just might be able to get away with
trying to control or restrict their use, e.g., by asserting that only
those with "something to hide" would want to encrypt their calls.

You and I know that such an argument would be utterly bogus and alien
to our Constitutional traditions. But history shows that people are
often willing to trade away those rights that they don't bother to
exercise themselves.

And even now, possession of pagers and cell phones is sometimes used
as "evidence" that an individual is involved in drug dealing, despite
the fact that many more legitimate people also use them. Sigh.

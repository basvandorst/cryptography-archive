The Codebreakers was just reprinted one or two years ago.  I picked up my
copy then.  A few new chapters were added for this printing (or at least
some text was added, may not have been full chapters).  It may now be
out of print as you have found.  You might want to call the publisher
directly to find out if they have sold their remaining stock to a
distributor.  This is too good a book to go out of print.

P.S. It was issued in paperback (and fairly mightily abridged) many years
before the latest reissuance.  I'd search for the hardcover version if I
were you.

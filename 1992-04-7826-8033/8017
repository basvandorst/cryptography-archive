HI,
	I am sure that this question has been beat to death on this
newsgroup but I will ask it anyway?  What would be a good method of
encrypting a set of coefficients obtained through the techniques for
multiresolution wavelewt analysis as outlined by Mallat?  To me, the
coefficients seem random enough when dealing with sounds but I guess
it isn't considered safe.  So, anyone have any suggestions?  Please mail
responses through e-mail as I don't read the group that often.  Thanks
in advance,

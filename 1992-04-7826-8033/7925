Ok, I'll bite...  How does one choose a key "in such a way that brute
force attacks are not possible"???  I think I'll try "zzzzzzzz".  :-)
Gimme a break!  Brute force is *always* "possible"...  It's just not
very *quick* sometimes.  Tell ya what...  let's divide up the keyspace
between all of us, and break it just for fun!  (That'd probably leave
us each with a share of about $5, eh?)

Serge!  Here's your chance to finance your trip to CalTech!  Go for it!!!

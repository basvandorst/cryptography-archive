This is so bogus on the part of the gov't!

Secure phones have been available (e.g, from Switzerland) for many
years.  All it took was money.  Of course, I don't have the kind of
money necessary, but then I'm not a drug dealer.

As you point out, this equipment is getting cheaper and will become
ever more widely available.  That's what the FBI &c. are fighting,
right?

Right.

Let's not prohibit the drug dealers from getting secure phones.

Let's try to prohibit normally paid, innocent folks from getting
secure phones.

...makes lots of sense.....

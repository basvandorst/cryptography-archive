That's not a good test.  A better test is described below.

This takes time.  The differential cryptanalytic attack on FEAL-8 was
not published for a couple of years.  This is the minimum amount of
time you ought to wait between publishing details of an algorithm and
using it.

No, that's not a valid test.  What you must do is:

	1. Publish the exact details of your algorithm.
	2. Get someone to send you some text, which you encipher.
	   (this text can be very large.)
	3. Send the enciphered text back to the tester.
	   The tester tries to find the key.
	4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the tester is satisfied.

If you do not publish the details of your algorithm, you're just
promoting Security Through Obscurity.  And if you can't allow multiple
adaptive attacks, your encryption algorithm isn't up to the job.

The "best" way to "try out" an encryption algorithm is to submit a
paper describing it to one of the Crypto conferences (Crypto,
Eurocrypt, Asiacrypt.)  If you're lucky :-), one of the attendees
might be able to break your algorithm there and then (this has
happened.)  Alternatively try Cryptologia or the Journal of
Cryptology.  Be warned, such journals tend to have a very long lead
time.

Good luck.

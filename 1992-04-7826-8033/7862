Of course, as a physicist, I have always held the opposite point of view.
Everywhere continuous but nowhere differentiable functions just don't crop up
much in physics, you know.  And you never see anything wierder than a tempered
distribution (EVERYTHING has to have a Fourier Transform of course).  That's
part of the reason why most physicists feel safe making all sorts of incorrect
mathematical statements.  You're almost always dealing with "nice" functions
and relatively harmless differential equations.  There are exceptions, more and
more, and especially in areas like quantum field theory you get in trouble if 
you try to get away with handwaving.  But for the most part, we deal with the
well-behaved parts of mathematics.  It seems to me that it's in the "purely
mathematical" parts of mathematics where most of the wierd things happen.

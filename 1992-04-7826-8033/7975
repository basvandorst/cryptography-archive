In _Clear and Present Danger_ someone sends a set of coordinates to
someone else by giving him the dictionary words (what are they called?
index words?  I forget, this goes back to second grade) on the pages
whose numbers are the appropriate coordinates...

I suppose this relies on others not being able to figure out what
dictionary you're using...

	I am interested in references which describe the algorithm for the 
UNIX password encryption scheme.  I would appreciate if anyone could e-mail
references to me (jsutin@cs.umr.edu) as I do not regularly read usenet.

	Thank you,
	Jason Sutin

PS. I am also interested in good references of encryption theory.

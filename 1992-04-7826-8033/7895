Uh, you should be using only k prime here.

Let me improve upon the argument using a different approach.

It is known (A THEOREM!) that any prime factor of 2^p - 1 is of the form
2kp+1 for some integer k >= 1. Now, if 2p+1 is prime, then it will divide
2^p-1 with probability 1/2. (Theorem! This arises from quadratic reciprocity
and the fact that 2 is a quadratic residue of 1/2 the primes). Similarly
one may argue that if 2kp+1 is prime, that it should divide 2^p-1 with
probability 1/2k. One should now ask what is the probability that no k
exists such that 2kp+1 divides 2^p-1 for any given p. This is about
1/2*3/4*5/6*...... up to 2kp+1 = sqrt(2^p-1), or k = sqrt(2^p-1)/2p. One
can estimate this product which essentially gives an estimate whether 2^p-1
is prime. This product up to k should be about O(1/log k). If one substitutes
the expression for k above one obtains O(1/p). That is to say the probability
that 2^p-1 is prime is proportional to 1/p. It is known that sum(1/p) diverges,
therefore one should expect an infinite number of Mersenne primes. In fact,
this leads to the following:

#{p < X; p prime and 2^p-1 is prime} = O(log log X).

One can get an explicit constant in the above expression. As it turns out,
the data we have so far seems to support this argument.

By the way, this is one of the major reasons why we would like to know
that we have ALL the Mersenne primes up to X when someone announces 2^X-1
is prime; If we were to obtain anomalous data, we would have to rethink
our arguments.

The argument I gave above leads to a result similar to that of the 
(more naiive) one previously posted, but does NOT have the same flaws.
One can not use it to imply that there are an infinity of primes of the
form 2^k for example.

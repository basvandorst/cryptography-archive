Essentially. What Heath-Brown did was to prove Artin's conjecture
was true with at most 2 exceptional primes. This is not **quite** the
full conjecture, since his proof leaves room for two possible exceptions.

Some people have expressed the opinion that he should have gotten a
Fields medal for this. Unfortunately classical analytic number theory
was not a popular topic among the selection committee.

His paper appeared quite recently, but I don't have a reference
right now. My wife [Claudia Spiro] has his paper in her office.

Keyword: Hashcoding / Search Algorithm / Optimization / C

   I'm trying to solve a little problem ...


   Let a_k = < e_1k,e_2k, ..., e_nk > a n-uple of integers.

   Foreach k, Foreach i in [1,n] 
        e_ik is in [ m_i, M_i ]   (property (1))

   Let E = { a_1, a_2, ... , a_N } a set of N of such n-uple.

   Foreach i, m_i and M_i do not depend on k, it means each
   n-uple a_k verifies the global property  (1).

   Assuming that N is rather large (about 10000) and
   n is rather large too (about 1000) , I'm trying to solve
   the following problem:

   Let F be a part of E.
   Let a in E.

      I want to determine wether or  not a is in E,
      assuming we want to do it quickly.

   Any idea about a fast search algorithm, or a good hashcoding
   algorithm are welcome.
   Any references are welcome too ...

   Thanks in advance.

   Guillaume.

A decade ago (when the RSA patent was issued) this was true.  In
recent years the lag has been closer to 3 years, and I understand
now it is about 1.5 years.  And some people think that when 
computerization efforts are complete it should only take 6 months
(I don't have the exact details, but they involve looking up
prior patents and prior art).

The fact that you're paranoid doesn't prove they're *not* out to get you.

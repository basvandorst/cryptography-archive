Hello everybody.
Some time ago  (appr. 4 months ) I tried to order D.Kahn's book
at my local bookstore. The order failed as McMillan answered that
the book is out of print.
Does anybody know whether it will appear again in the next
future (maybe as a revised edition covering the last decades, too)?
Thomas

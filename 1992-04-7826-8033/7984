Unix password encryption?  (It's not only the bad guys that might want fast
encryption).  

Fast file encryption using an algorithm (which includes the S-box values)
not supported by most of the dedicated encryption hardware out there in
the hand of potential crackers?

Fast file encryption using an algorithm that the spooks haven't bothered to
spend much effort on, compared to the standard DES S-boxes?

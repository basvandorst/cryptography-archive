I need to research the impact of a new government regulation on
encryption in software products for export.

Apparently, the U.S. Department of Commerce has issued a revised
export control list pursuant to 15CFR CH VII Pt 770.  I understand
that controls have been placed on all technology and software which
uses ANSI Standard Data Encryption Algorithms.  There seems to be a
lot of confusion about what this means to software companies.  The
questions I have are:

    1.  Does basic encryption of passwords apply?

    2.	Do you have to use certain algorithms before this applies?

    3.	Can you use DES and still export?

    4.	What if your product can encrypt data?

I'd sure appreciate any information on this subject.

Thanks,

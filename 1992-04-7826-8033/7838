PGP 1.0 can still be had if you know where to look for it.  It does
everything Lyndon wants and includes source code (unfortunately, for
MS-DOS, but it should be easy to port).  I wouldn't use it in commercial
software, however, unless you'd like to be the first to test RSAs
patents in court.  Of course, if you're not in the USA, you have nothing
to worry about (yet).

I don't know if this is appropriate for this newsgroup (probably not),
but it's my understanding that mathematical theorums, concepts, etc. are
not patentable (at least not in the US).  If this is the case, then
can't RSAs patent(s) on public key encryption be attacked on the basis of
it fundamentally being a mathematical algorithm.

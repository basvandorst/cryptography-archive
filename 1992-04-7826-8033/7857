When antinomies like the Russell Paradox appeared in set theory, a lot
of mathematicians were surprised. They had intuitively believed that their
set theory was consistent, but it turned out to be inconsistent.

Also Goedel's Incompleteness Theorem was another result which was very counter-
intuitive. Hilbert had an entire program to formalize all of mathematics,
until Goedel basically proved that the task was impossible.

I think that there are probably *heaps* of other good examples.

We can control the definitions, the axioms, and the rules of inference.
But once we have done this we have no control over which propositions are
theorems. We can only choose we propositions we try to prove or disprove.

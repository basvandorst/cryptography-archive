I remember a discussion not too long ago about the number of logic
gates necessary to simulate the bits of the DES S-box. Someone
observed that the DES S-boxes are more complex than random boxes. In
this case the measure of complexity is the number of logic gates that
it takes to simulate the result.  Can anyone point me to a reference
on this subject?


Thanks,

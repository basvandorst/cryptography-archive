This bit bothered me in a previous posting by someone. There is indeed
a portion of the GATT treaty that seeks to bring about equilisation of
the patent laws, but, as you know, it is only the US that have software
patent laws.

I went into MERT (Ministry of External Relations and Trade) after talking
with the HOD of Commercial Law (who suggested it) and asked them what our
position was: their initial reaction was that they believed they would
follow that rule imposed in the commonwealth, i.e algorithms cannot be
patented. They referred me on, and I didn't have time to follow it up.

I would heartily encourage that people from other countries find out from
their Ministries, or whatever about what their view on the Intellectual
Properties, etc portion of the patent equalisation is. The US is having
trouble making the EEC see it their way on agriculture (which NZ does, in
fact support). It could be most amusing for the rest of it...

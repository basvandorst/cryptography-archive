I have seen the MD4 and MD5 implementations from the /pub/md*/portable
directories of RSA's server.  When compiled in the (16-bit) DOS
environment, the actual digestor code comprises about 5-7k binary,
with about 200 bytes data requirement (unless I read my map file
wrong).  I'll admit that I haven't seen anything from the
/pub/md*/optimized directories yet, but I assume that these are
optimised for speed.

I am interested in implementations that have been optimised with
*size* in mind.  Has anybody done this?  Can anybody comfirm the
data space requirement?

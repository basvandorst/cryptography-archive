Hello folks,

I'm a graduate student of computer science.
For about half a year, I deal with authentication and the appropriate
protocols of the authentication literature.
In this context I`ve got a question, which drives me into desparation.
Perhaps somebody can help me:

There are three ways to generate nonces:
1)
The nonce is a kind of time stamp. That guarantees that every nonce
can be generated only one time.
2)
The nonce is a sequence number, but independent of the time.
3)
The nonce is a pseudo, random number.

Is it necessary or at least useful to implement a management of generated
and used nonces ?
For which side is it useful ?
Are there Nonce-Generation-Algorithms, preventing the
generation of the same NONCE a second time ?

I appreciate every answer,
thanks in advance,

Peter.

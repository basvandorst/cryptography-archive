Hi,

my question is simple. Is using DSA for AV (authenticy verification) allowed
or not. I have the following assumptions and want to know it they are true
or if anyone knows more.

- the RSA patent covers public key encryption (which seems impossible to do to
  me with DSA) and not AV
- it is allowed to export AV code from the US to other nations

I am especialy interested in hard facts (laws, jurispriction, documents etc).

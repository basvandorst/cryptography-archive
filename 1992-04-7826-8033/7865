Hello!  I'm looking for a basic algorithm to encrypt (and decrypt) an arbitrary
block of data.  However, the algorithm must NOT be restricted for export
from the U.S.A.  As I understand it, this prohibits the use of DES.  I've heard
it rumored, however, that modifications can be made to the DES sboxes which
would make it suitable for export.  Does anyone have any ideas on:

	a) A suitable algorithm to use
	b) where I can get an implementation of it in 'C'.

You can e-mail me at the address below.

Thanks in advance.

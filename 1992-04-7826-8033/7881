Here's my theory.

Various people have noticed that you can get very accurate little
quartz clocks that will stay in sync.  Maybe they do some sort of
time-based encryption to generate a new key each 7 seconds.

The boxes would still have to "share a secret" in order to be secure...
but presumably the secret meta-key is installed in the factory, and
the 7-second session keys are generated using some sort of
cryptographically secure means, such as DES'ing the current time
using the meta-key to create a 7-second key.

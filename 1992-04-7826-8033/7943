I'm currently writing a paper on the impact of computers on security, risks, loss,
etc.  To do this, I need a good overall list of current and future technologies to
analyze for their risk/threat value.  I just need broad headings, such as 'disk
drives:  floppy, CD-ROM, optical, ...'

I imagine such a list is fairly lengthy, so let me know how I can get a copy in a
machine readable format.

Thanks one and all for your help, or at least reading this message.

I'm looking for an algorithm to find Phi(n) of the type that's
used in the different exponential cryptosystems.
If nobody has any ideas about that, how about a function that
would tell me if the parameter passed to it is prime?
Or a function that yields an array giving the prime
factorization of the passed parameter.

Thanks,

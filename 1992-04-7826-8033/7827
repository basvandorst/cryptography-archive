>:Cray has just announced the discovery of a new Mersenne prime. It
>:is 2^756839 - 1 and is over 3 times the size of the last one. It was
>:discovered by a Cray-2 in England. It has 227,832 digits.

Our local paper ran the AP story on this.  (No mention of England, only
David Slowinski of Cray Research in Cheppewa Falls, Wisconsin.)  

Here is my favorite paragraph from the newpaper story:

   "There are billions and billions of prime numbers," Slowinski said.  But
this is only the 32nd Mersenne.

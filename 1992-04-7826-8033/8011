The concept of plaintext encryption (defined as encryption
that has as its output factual, rational, coherent, and informative
text) has basically destroyed the ability of the NSA to find
encrypted text, let alone decrypt it.  When everything looks
and feels like simple plaintext, there is nothing to focus the
eavesdropping supercomputer on.  My advice to all you budding
cryptographers is >not< to work for the NSA, at least until the
agency sorts out this methodological and philospophical mess.
Any Comments?

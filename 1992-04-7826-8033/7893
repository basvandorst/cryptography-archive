An excerpt from the beginning of a related joke, the novel "Gadsby",
by E. V. Wright, Wetzel Publishing, 1939, dedicated "To Youth":

   "If youth, throughout all history, had had a champion to stand up for
    it ...  you wouldn't know folks today who claim that 'a child don't
    know anything ...'  I am going to show you how a bunch of bright
    young folks did find a champion, a man of such dominating and happy
    individuality that Youth is drawn to him as is a fly to a sugar
    bowl.  It is a story about a small town.  It is not a gossipy yarn;
    nor is it a dry, monotonous account full of such customary
    'fill-ins' as 'romantic moonlight casting shadows down a long,
    winding country road.'  Nor will it say anything about twinklings
    lulling distant folds; robins caroling at twilight, nor any 'warm
    glow of lamplight' from a cabin window."

I understand the author kept this up for 50 thousand words.

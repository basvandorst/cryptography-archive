You start with a block cipher with an unknown key. Call the cipher
f(p) where p is a (usually 64 bit) plaintext. You feed in pairs
of plaintexts with some XOR difference X. There is some probability
that the resulting ciphertexts will have an XOR difference of Y.
i.e. f(p) + f(p + X) = Y with some (usually very very low) probability.
You keep picking random p values until you get a match.

You choose X and Y which have the best probabilities of success.
Based on the characteristics of X and Y, you know the propagation
of the differences through the rounds of the cipher (DES is 16 rounds),
and if you get a match with the above equation, then you know
(with some certainty) the difference in each round of the cipher.
Knowing these differences, and the values of the ciphertexts you
just calculated, you can begin finding key bits.

That was a brief summary. The technique for choosing X and Y, and
the procedure for actually finding key bits, would take several
pages. I suggest you look at Biham and Shamir's paper "Differential
Cryptanalysis of DES-like Cryptosystems".

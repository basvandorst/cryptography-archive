This is probably true, but nevertheless it puzzles me. If there is no
proof, how can mathematicians have a "gut-feeling" about it? Is there
any way to extrapolate from proofs about other things to the area of
Mersenne primes?

I guess what I'm really asking is: Does the term "mathematical intuition"
make any sense? Does having hunches about unprovable things make any
sense?

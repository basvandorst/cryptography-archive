Could you please summarize the different answers you've received?  I'ld like
to know!  (And I suspect somebody else out there might be curious.

Some observations:
a) The number of characters in the cipher text is larger than the plaintext.
   This might be a problem in some applications.
b) If you never reuse a page, you run out of pages rather quickly!
c) Not reusing a paragraph lets you encipher maybe 10-20 times more text
   before you need another book.
d) Characters that may be rare in the book but are needed in the cleartext
   can be a bit of a pain.
e) If you never reuse the page, you are getting awefully close to a one-time
   pad.  If I were the cryptanalyst, I would send a covert team to survey your
   bookshelves to look for likely candidates for a directed search -- after all,
   I DO know that you are using SOME book, SOMEWHERE...  (Note that the key
   document for the cipher of Beale paper #2 was found by exhaustively trying
   likely candidates.)  (Now suppose that most commonly available (ie. in print)
   books were all in computer readable form, so I could just hand your
   ciphertext to my hanger full of book testers...  I wonder if I could convince
   Congress to fund it...  if they haven't already. ;-)  )


karger@osf.org (Paul A. Karger) memory is jogged:

I do have my copy to hand, and the nearest thing I can find is Friedman's
"Hindu book cipher" solution in 1917, as related on pages 371-373.  It is
important that the encipherer had a much sloppier system -- reusing cipher
equivalants, using many characters from the same line of the book (!),
enciphering only "important" words and leaving them in the middle of cleartext,
etc.  The description of Mrs. Friedman's solution of enciphered codes used by
1930's rumrunners around page 805 is interesting, but not directly relevant
to book ciphers.  (She does tell of testing hundreds of commercial code books
during her search for the solution.)

I am writing a piece of software for a PC that will not run unless
a password is given. What I am looking for is a fragment of C code that
will encrypt/decrypt a small password file eg. 10 characters. 

I'm not looking for DES or RSA security, just something nasty enough to 
give non-crypto experts a hard time.

I have access to Turbo-C, Microsoft C and Borland C++ compilers.

Please don't respond with advice like "Use the XYZ method" because I 
don't know anything about cryptography, and haven't got enough time to 
learn.

Please respond by email. All I can offer in return is gratitude.

Thanking you in advance.

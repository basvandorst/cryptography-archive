OK, here's my stab at it:

It'll just be a law requiring licensing of electronic publishing which
must be implemented to fight the crime and unacceptable activity on
electronic networks like the numerous copyright fraud, obscene speech,
unAmerican activies, conspiratory action, credit card violations,
child pornography, encouragement to drug use (alt.drugs,
talk.politics.drugs), encouragement to violence (talk.politics.guns),
threats to national security (sci.crypt, alt.conspiracy), sexual
deviations (soc.motss, alt.sex.bestiality), computer criminality
(alt.hackers, alt.security).  Expect it to appear in a generic
anti-crime bill from your friendly administration which brought you
the War on Constitution, civil forfeitures, FCC bans on radio waves
and all the other things which are needed to fight crime.

It will be a new law designed for the purpose of limiting unsupervised
information exchange needed to limit increasing computer crime,
copyright violations, child pornography, terrorism and credit card and
wire fraud.  Perhaps it could be implemented by requiring reporting of
editors responsible for the contents of any public electronic forums,
requirements to have real names used everywhere, requirements of
cleartext communications (already proposed), requirements to respect
"community standards" on the media, requirements for "equal coverage"
and other such good-sounding rhetorics.  Perhaps by some other means.

Does that seem so impossible or improbable when looking at FCC content
restrictions, the proposal circulating to require the telephone
network to be built for the purpose of surveillance on everyone, the
civil forfeitures, the proposed anti-cryptography bill, all of the War
on Constitution legislation?

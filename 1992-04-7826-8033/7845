I have spent some time working on a section of text which came from the
Dark Avenger virus. A frequency scan showed that it was definetely not
monoalphabetic encryption, but the text did not appear to be encrypted
too well either. In fact, I do not know if it is not just garbage
ecnrypted to fool people. (A message at the start of the encrypted section
implied that this was possible). Of course so far I assume it is English.
Might be Bulgarian, though. Anyway....

So I wondered if anyone out there will volunteer some results if they
have seen the virus, or if they could send on some info on more complicated
decryption techniques. At present I vhave only got access to a rather
mathematical book by Neal Koblitz ("Number Theory and Cryptography). Having
to work off straight frequency analysis is no fun!

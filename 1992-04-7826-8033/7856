Everybody knows the US is 'a bit' paranoid about encryption technologies and
exports. For instance, it seems that the new Public Key algorithm that was
written by someone from NeXT Inc. will not be available outside the US.

I have two questions:
	1. Are there good public domain sources for Public Key encryption
	techniques, preferably the RSA scheme?
	2. Are they available in Europe?

Thanks,

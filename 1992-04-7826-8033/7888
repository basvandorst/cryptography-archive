Even this is on the edge of practicality, for the high end of the
personal computer range.  With a data rate of 9600 or 14.4K bps, you can
get by with a pretty simple vocoder.  A 386 box or a high end Mac should
have plenty of horsepower...

This is a project I have been wishing I had the free time to do...

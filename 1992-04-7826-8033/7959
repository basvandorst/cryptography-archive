There was some talk recently about secure telephones, and an 'encrypting'
cordless telephone made by motorola (which wasn't very secure at all).
The talk about the professional 'secure' telephones (MIL-std devices
that cost big bucks) made it sound like the basic system was

 voice -> mic -> A/D converter -> encrypt circuit or algorithm -> modem ->
 telephone line -> modem -> decrypt circuit or algorithm -> D/A converter ->
 speaker

Certainly this can be done with an IBM PC, Macintosh, Amiga, Sparcstation,
or other computer that many already have.

So, my question is, does anyone know of a software/soft&hardware solution
for secure voice communication over telephone lines?

By secure, I guess I mean DES or safer encryption.

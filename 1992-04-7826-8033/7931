Sorry to post a real newby question to sci.crypt, but:

In article <2306@accucx.cc.ruu.nl> nevries@accucx.cc.ruu.nl (Nico de Vries.) writes:

Does anyonr know of a site for the sources? archie gives me a number
of sites but the one I managed to get through to was an ms-dos
executable :-(.

More specifically, I'm just looking for the source to a reasonable
encoder (encrypter?) and decoder/decrypter that I can just compile
and go. US legality doesn't matter! 

Many thanks.

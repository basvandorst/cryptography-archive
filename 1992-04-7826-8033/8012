The May 1992 issue of Dr. Dobb's Journal ("Software Tools for the
Professional Programmer") has a lengthy article by Bruce Schneier
entitled "Untangling Public-Key Cryptography".  It covers a lot of
ground--our favorite hypothetical duo, Alice and Bob, exchange a
lot of messages in the article.  

Schneier's article is worth a read, especially for his coverage
of non-obvious applications of public key cryptology.

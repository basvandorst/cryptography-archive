Hello,

I'm trying (mostly just for fun) to program RSA with Mathematica 2.0.
I'm wondering what are 'good' primes. In [Rosen] reads:
(n=pq, a product of two large primes)
	1)  p-1 and q-1 should have large prime factors.
	    (They have a factor of two, but no other factors among
 	     the first 1000 primes?)
	2)  The greatest commond divisor of p-1 and q-1 should be small.
	    (Less than 100?)
	3)  p and q should have decimal expansions differing in length
	    by a few digits.
	    (p 100 digits, q 102 digits?)

Are these bounds sufficient, should I use more digits/primes/etc?

ps. What is the Lucas-test Mathematica uses? I know of the Lucas-Lehmer,
    but I understood it was only for Mersenne-numbers... (That Miller
    test is in this book.)

[Rosen] Kenneth H. Rosen, Elementary Number Theory And Its Applications,
        2nd Edition, Addison-Wesley 1988.

That book also has an excellent description of RSA, btw.

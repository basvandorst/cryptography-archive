To implement a secure telephone on a personal computer, workstation
or laptop, you need the following components:

1. Sufficient processing power to execute the encryption
algorithm in real time.
2. A modem.
3. A voice coder/decoder operating at a data rate within that
supported by the modem.

Given a reasonable software implementation, item #1 is no longer a
problem with most modern computers, even if DES is used. As for item 2,
V.32 modems operating at 9600 bps are already widespread, and V.32bis
modems operating at 14400 bps are just now hitting the market. Within
several years they too should be widespread.

The problem is #3.  The voice-quality codecs built into several
present-day computers (e.g., Macintosh, Sparcstation, NEXT) are
generally waveform coders with relatively high bit rates (i.e., greater
than can be handled by voiceband phone modems).

What we really need is for desk computers and laptops to include, as a
standard feature, high quality speech coders operating at data rates
below those of the voiceband modems available at the same time. Then
all it will take to turn one of these computers into a secure telephone
is some software.

If you're not subject to the Yankee government's offensive rules,
then go for DES.  Good ftp sites, last time I checked, included 
nic.funet.fi kampi.hut.fi and some place in .dk .
One advantage is that you're using the same code everyone else has,
which increases the number of people you can use it to communicate with.

Personally, I wonder how the rules would be applied if some American
designed an encryption algorithm and expressed it in some clear
unambiguous mathematical notation such as the ALGOrithmic Language ALGOL
or Church's Lambda Calculus and published it, but I'm not the guy to try it :-)
Meanwhile, the Data Encryption Algorithm has been widely published,
and good versions are available in differently-free countries.

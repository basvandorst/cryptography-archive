I saw a copy of the online newsletter of the
Electronic Frontier Foundation, and they had a
mention of a talk at the Computers, Freedom and Privacy
conference by Eric Hughes of DigiCash.

Apparently DigiCash is hoping to set up a system of
"electronic money".  You could order, say, documents over
the Internet and pay for it with this "money".  Transactions
would be confidential and anonymous.  It would be like
cash in that way.

It relies on cryptography for its security and anonymity.
I've heard that the company is based on the Netherlands and
has some top cryptography people associated with it.

Does anyone have more information on DigiCash, and the
specifics of their money system?

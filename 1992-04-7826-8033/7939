I don't know very much about cryptography, however, every encryption
is supposed to give output that closely resembles random data.

Huh? If it is normal ascii, it has an information content of about
5 bits per byte (max), this gives you three bits/byte that get
"expected values" when you decrypt correctly. This gives you about
4.5K of "expected data", this is much longer than the .... distance
that theoretically gives you the password. (in practice you often need
at least double, however 4.5K with a key of 7 bytes gives a lot of
room for higher datacontent in the file, as well as larger requirements
to find the password.)

Does this give you more "known plaintext"?

The question is wether or not the algorithm is "know plaintext" proof.
It should be if it is to be considered "strong", however I don't know
about the PKWARE encryption scheme.

I agree with you that nobody ever uses a password that contains
56 bits of information in 7 bytes.

Well, if the password is cracked, there is MUCH more point in it:
A good encryption scheme should withstand known plaintext attacks, 
however if it breaks under "not known plaintext" attacks is is even
weaker! (i.e. If it isn't broken, PKWARE can't say their software is
safe)

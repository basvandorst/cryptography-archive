You've just (re)invented security through obscurity.  The goal is to find
algorithms that are secure, even if the algorithm is publicly known, and
the "enemy" has access to other data encrypted with the same key (in both
encrypted & non-encrypted form), etc.  If knowing the algorithm makes it
possible to defeat the encryption, your system is of little practical use,
since anyone with a reverse-assembler and patience can figure out how the
encryption is done.

If you post your complete algorithm, I'm sure you'll get plenty of
feedback/suggestions.

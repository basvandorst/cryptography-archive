I am knocking up a quick ZIPCRACK of my own (therefore no 
export laws have been violated ;^).  I've coded it and
it doesn't (like my code usually does ;^) work first time.
Now some test data would be real useful to spot which routine
is faulty.  I don't suppose anybody has any?  Is anybody 
allowed to give me any?

Thanks in advance.

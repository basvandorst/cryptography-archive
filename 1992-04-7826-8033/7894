Just a lucky guess. 
There is NO reason to suspect a Mersenne prime other than that the absence of
small factors makes it slightly more likely to be prime.

:(2) A closely related question: how many primes can be excluded by means

About 50 to 55% can be excluded by finding a small prime factor.

The theorem works because 2 is a primitive root. Any prime that has 2 as a
primitive root must be congruent to 1 or -1 mod 8. Here, we have 2p+1 = 8n+7.

One can construct similar theorems using higher reciprocity laws. They tend
to have limited value.

	Just under 50% of the primes need be checked via Lucas-Lehmer.

:(3) How long did the calculation take? I hear some rumours about nineteen

May I ask what variant of FFT you are using for your multiplies???

Sorry if this topic has been through here before, but does anybody know the
format of the codes for those VCR-Plus machines?  If you know the proper
coding sequence, please e-mail me; I keep misplacing my TV-Guide, and if a
calculator or PC can do the trick, that'd be way cool, dude... :-)


Thanks in advance.

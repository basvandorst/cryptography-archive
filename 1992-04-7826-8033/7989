I have seen people post here asking for various implementations of the
Data Encryption Standard, and saw a list of European-made DES chips.  I
don't understand WHY anyone would want to use the DES, if what I have read
about it is true, namely that the key length was intentionally held down to
56 bits so that the NSA could leave itself a back door somewhere.  In
particular, why would Europeans want to use a cryptosystem that is readable
by the US government?

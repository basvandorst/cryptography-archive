As I understand them, one time pads should be at least as long as the cleartext
they are being used against.

My question is: When the text is encrypted, what algorithim is used? Do you
increment the cleartext character by character with the coresponding pad
character? Is such a manipulation done by shifting the cleartext character by
the pad character's numeric equivalent (i.e. 'm' + 'c' = 'o')?

If you wish to email me, please use this address: cmenser@vyonous.kennesaw.edu

Many thanks,
Charles

P.S. Are one time pads addressed in "The Codebreakers", I have not yet located 
     copy.

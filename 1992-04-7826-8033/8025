Is the "Cryptosystems Journal" still in publication?
About 2 years ago, its editor (Tony S. Patti) would
mention articles-in-progress and so forth here on the net.

If it's still going, what address / telephone number
should I use to begin a subscription?  I checked
our site's back articles but we only have the most
recent 75 postings, from 4-15-92 onward.

I'd also like to ask for the subscription info for
_Cryptologia_, the journal whose articles are
collected into book form (by Deavors & Krugh etc).

Thanks very much!

Right about exportability.  Of course, if someone were to write a PEM
program that relied upon RSAREF, the source code to that program
would be exportable.  But when you compiled & linked it, you'd 
find a lot of unsatisfied external references.  Sorry--I sympathize
with your plight, but can't see a way of addressing it from where I
sit. 

Rumor has it that the licensing restrictions on RSAREF will
be relaxed in the not-too-distant future.  This will make it
more practical to distribute apps based on RSAREF.

I am no longer distributing it.

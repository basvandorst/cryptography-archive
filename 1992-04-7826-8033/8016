If all you want is a public key cryptosystem, I've seen RPEM (runs
under Unix) available for anonymous FTP from a bunch of sites.  Telnet to
archie.sura.net as archie and type 'prog rpem' for a current listing.
Be aware that the program may violate certain "patents" held by PKP and
that I don't know the legalities involved in its use.  The same, of
course, is true of PGP though.

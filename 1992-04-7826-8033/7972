Are the VCR's that have VCR+ built in only allowing you to program based
on the VCR+ code?

It seems to me that you could use an alternate coding scheme which would
of course involve more numbers in place of VCR+ (or just program the VCR
the old way).

Simplified code:

1 digit  - day the program is on [0=Sun .. 6=Sat, 7=all days, 8=M..F, 9=S+S]
2 digits - start hour [00..23 or 38..61 (add 50 to PM hours)]
2 digits - start minute [00..59]
3 digit  - hours and minutes run time
2 digits - channel number

So to record channel 7 at 8:30 PM on Tuesday night for 1 hour and 30 minutes:

    2 58 30 130 07

To record the weekday news each day at 6 PM on channel 13:

    8 56 00 030 13

But TV Guide and others of course would rather you buy their publication to
get the numbers (which is why it is encrypted and they are trying to protect
the algorithm).  With such a simple system like this, people would not buy
TV Guide just for the numbers.

I don't buy TV Guide and I just program my VCR the old fashioned way from
advertising about future programs or the ones I regularly know about.

Here are some more questions concerning Mersenne primes in general and
the new one in particular:

(1) What made Cray check that particular prime? Was it just one prime in a 
    long series of tests, or is there any reason to suspect a Mersenne prime 
    before doing the actual testing?

(2) A closely related question: how many primes can be excluded by means
    simpler than the Lucas test? The simplest theorem about factors of
    Mersenne numbers is given in Hardy and Wright and states, if I recall
    correctly, that M_p for p = 4n + 3 and 2p + 1 prime is divisible by
    2p + 1. Are there many more theorems of a similar nature, and, if you have
    exhausted them all, for how many primes do you have to do the actual
    checking?

(3) How long did the calculation take? I hear some rumours about nineteen
    hours, but it is not clear whether this refers to the testing of several
    primes, or to 756839 alone. I am particularly interested in this
    question since I wrote a little program of my own for checking Mersenne
    primes, and of course I want to know how it compares to other people's
    efforts. I am currently verifying the 756839 test, and I expect the
    answer on Wednesday at 8 a.m. sharp, Central European Daylight Saving
    Time. I am running the program on an IBM RISC/6000-550 workstation, and
    I estimate the calculation to take 112 hours. If the Cray people needed
    19 hours for the single test then it seems my program is reasonably fast:
    The cycle time of the RS/6000 is six times the cycle time of the Cray 2,
    and the calculation takes roughly six times nineteen hours.

The title says it all.  David Koontz posted a "fdes.c" program
here six months or so ago.  It was snarfed-up by someone here,
who didn't write down the way to contact him.  While doing
some testing, we ran into an implementation question we'd
like to discuss with him.  The posted version carries a SCCS
id of "@(#) fdes.c 1.1 91/05/02".

    David, please send us your net-address and/or phone-number.

Thanks, ...Paul

Very.  But you need to be careful what you mean.  A sentence's undecidability
is only meaningful with respect to a specific theory; for example
if S is a sentence, then S is undecidable in theory T if T proves
neither S nor (not S).  But S will always be decidable in *some*
theory, for example if you take S as an axiom.

Well, sort of.  It's true that you can prove that if FLT is undecidable
in (say) Peano Arithmetic, then FLT is true, since if it were false
the counterexample would provide a proof of (not FLT) from PA.

However, you have no hope of proving *in PA itself* that FLT is
undecidable in PA, since that would imply that PA is consistent,
which is not provable from PA (assuming that PA is in fact consistent).
But it might conceivably be possible to prove in some stronger
theory, say PA+Con(PA), that FLT is undecidable in PA.
(Con(PA) is the formalization of the assertion "PA is consistent")

Now if you had a proof from PA+Con(PA) that FLT is undecidable in
PA, then you would have a proof from PA+Con(PA) of FLT.  But you
would not have such a proof from PA, so FLT would still be undecidable
in PA.

Of course a proof from PA+Con(PA) would settle the issue in practically
everyone's mind.  But that wouldn't change the fact that there still
would be no proof from PA.

> Does this generalize?

Not completely.  The particular arguments here apply only to
\Pi^0_1 sentences; roughly speaking, a sentence is \Pi^0_1 if
it asserts that a particular computer program will never halt.
(In this case, for example, a program searching for a counterexample
to FLT.)

So for example the Continuum Hypothesis, which asserts that there
are no sets of intermediate cardinality between that of the integers
and that of the reals, has been proved undecidable in ZFC (assuming
ZFC is consistent).  But that does *not* lead to a proof of
CH from ZFC+Con(ZFC), because CH is not \Pi^0_1.

Whoa --- one also needs that half the primes p *such that 2p+1 is prime*
are congruent to 1 mod 4; it is still a big open problem to prove that
there are infinitely many such p to begin with!  I certainly have no
reasonable doubt that there are infinitely many, and that they are
correctly distributed mod 4, but a "Theorem!" it isn't.

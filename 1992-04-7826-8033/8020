I'm on a quest for a double-9 square (a 9x9 grid of 9-letter words,
each of which is different), and I need quite a large database of words
in order to have any chance of finding one.  What collections of
words *are* available in computer-readable format?  I have the army's
Web2 (which *only* contains main entries, and not plurals etc.), the
Official Scrabble Player's Dictionary, and two editions of Webster's
Pocket.  I called the NSA today to see if they had anything available,
but no one knew what I was mumbling about.  So, exactly what is
available?  The NSA *must* have a huge collection of words in
computer-readable form; would this be available to a private
citizen (geez, I've paid enough in taxes)?  I'd also be willing to
pay up to $500 for a complete Web2 or a complete Web3.  Is the
Oxford available?  I'd also be interested in cities, scientific
terms (minerals, animals, etc.), phrases, etc.  I'm not interested
in any definitions, just words.

I've heard a rumor that the complete Web2 *is* available from
a Dr. Levine in North Carolina, but I don't have any information
beyond that.

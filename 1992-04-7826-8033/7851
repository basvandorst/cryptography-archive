Unfortunately, I don't think this will convince the original poster.
S/He asked about whether you can have mathematical intuition about
unprovable assertions.  I don't think the probabilistic argument above
will be very compelling to that person, since it depends upon the
listener knowing a lot of >other< assumptions and conjectures,
unstated here.  To see what I mean, just note that the same argument
would work to argue that there are an infinite number of primes of the
form 2^k, or 3^k - 1, but in fact we know there is precisely 1 in each
of those cases.  A more reasonable example would be: the same argument
would imply an infinite number of primes of the form 2^k + 1.

Just add that (as far as I know) when you factor in all of the
>currently< known theorems about prime numbers, the (>>very<<
imprecise) expected value of the number of primes of the form 2^k - 1
still diverges.  This argument is very hand-wavy, and makes no bones
about it: it is simply a conjecture of what might go on inside the
head of working mathematicians to give them the intuition that there
are an infinite number of Mersenne primes.  But what do I know?  I'm
not a working mathematician.

The reason the same argument doesn't work for 2^k + 1 is that we
>>do<< have other evidence: the only 2^k + 1 that are prime are Fermat
numbers, and Fermat primes are rare (as the previous post pointed out,
perhaps there are only a finite number).

Unfortunately, I'm not sure that this enhancement to the argument will
help the original poster, either.

There's a lot of fascinating stuff in switching theory on this topic. It's used
to work out ways of implementing various digital functions in soft logic such
as PLA's and RAM. Try:

`Recent Developments in Switching Theory'
ed: A. Mukhopadhyay
AP, 1971

and

`Spectral Techniques in Digital Logic'
S. L. Hurst, D. M. Miller and J. C. Muzio
AP, 1985

I suspect that a lot of this stuff could be used in cryptanalysis if one
had the time to sit down and work it all out.

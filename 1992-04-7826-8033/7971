I don't have my copy of Kahn's, The Codebreakers, with me, but as I recall, William Friedman broke a book cipher of this sort during the 1930s.  The cipher was in use by some kind of smugglers, and Friedman only found out what book they were using when they were finally brought 
to trial.   As I recall, the basis of breaking book ciphers is that
the book follows the statistics of the English language (or Spanish
or Urdu or whatever).   Can anyone on the net fill in the history
of this better than I can?

(Just for reference, William Friedman was in charge of the group that
broke the Japanese Purple code, prior to Pearl Harbor, and is generally
regarded as the father of modern cryptography.   His wife was also
an outstanding cryptographer, so she is presumably the mother of
modern cryptography!)

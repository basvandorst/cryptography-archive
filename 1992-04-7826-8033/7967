I'm a little confused.  I thought RSAREF had a pretty strict license
agreement surrounding it and, importantly, could not be exported
outside the USA.  As such, non-USAn's such as myself cannot use it.

In this case I suppose it's a matter of "public domain" provided you're
a US citizen living inside the USA. :-(

By the way, what is the current status of RPEM?

Cheers,

Paul.

If your mailer can't reach me, I'm obviously not worth talking to.

              Pretty Good Privacy version 2.6.i - READ ME FIRST
                          Notes by Stale Schumacher
                                 1994/09/29


You are looking at the README file for PGP release 2.6.i. PGP, short for
Pretty Good Privacy, is a public key encryption package; with it, you can
secure messages you transmit against unauthorized reading and digitally sign
them so that people receiving them can be sure they come from you.


ABOUT THIS VERSION

PGP 2.6.i is not an official PGP version. It is based on the source code for
MIT PGP 2.6.1 (the latest official version of PGP) and has been modified for
international use. However, it is still possible to compile a version of PGP
that is byte-identical to MIT PGP 2.6.1 (using the USA_ONLY option, see
below). This file only explains what is special to version 2.6.i. For a more
thorough installation and usage guide, refer to the file setup.doc and the
documentation for PGP 2.6.1, which is included unmodified in the doc/
subdirectory that is created when you unpack the distribution archive.


BACKGROUND

Until a few months ago, there were only two "real" PGP versions around: PGP
2.3a which was the international freeware version, and 2.4 which was a
commercial version sold in USA by a company called ViaCrypt. However, this
situation changed dramatically in May 1994 when MIT released a special US
freeware version of PGP (2.5), in order to put an end to the legal problems
surrounding PGP. (PGP 2.3a was believed to be illegal in USA because of patent
restrictions.) The new version had a number of limitations to encourage
Americans that were using 2.3a illegally to upgrade to the legal version.
However, these limitations resulted in a well of new PGP versions, more or
less professionally put together by well-intending individuals who wanted a
more flexible PGP than that offered by MIT. Suddenly, we had ten different PGP
versions, not two.

Even though PGP 2.5 and later releases from MIT introduced many bug-fixes and
improvements over 2.3a, many non-US users of PGP have been reluctant to
upgrade to the new versions because they feel that the PGP developers have
abandoned the international PGP community by adding a number of restrictions
that are only necessary within the USA. That is why I decided to make PGP
2.6.i: to put an end to all the PGP "hack versions" that flourish, and by
giving the non-US users of PGP a version that is more "digestible" than those
offered by MIT, and at the same time let them benefit from all the
improvements that the new versions have introduced over PGP 2.3a. Please note
that PGP 2.6.i is a "real" 2.6 version, as it is based on the code tree for
PGP 2.6.1 and not 2.3a. PGP 2.6.1 was exported illegally from the USA, but
once exported anyone may use it legally and modify it for personal use. That's
what I did, although I later decided to make it available for the general
public. So here it is: PGP 2.6.i.


HOW WAS IT DONE?

PGP 2.6.i was put together by taking all the source files from PGP 2.6.1 and
the rsaglue.c file from PGP 2.3a, adding a few #ifdef's and modifying a
handful of lines - and that's it. In fact, the use of #ifdef's wherever a
change has been made allows you to compile a version that is byte-identical
to MIT PGP 2.6.1. This is accomplished by adding the -DUSA_ONLY option when
building the program. The source archives even includes two sets of makefiles:
one for use inside the USA (2.6.1) and one for the rest of the world (2.6.i).


DISTRIBUTION

PGP 2.6.i is distributed in the following files:

- - pgp26i.zip       This is the MS-DOS executable release, which includes the
                   executable, support files, and basic documentation.

- - pgp26is.zip      This is a source code release, which includes all the
                   source code needed to compile PGP and examples of usage.
                   It also contains all the files in pgp26i.zip except the
                   pgp.exe binary.

- - pgp26is.tar.gz   This contains exactly the same files as pgp26is.zip,
                   except that they use Unix rather than MS-DOS line end
                   conventions.

- - pgp26is.tar.Z    This is a Unix compress version of pgp26is.tar.gz.

If you are within the USA, you should download the file pgp261.zip instead
(MS-DOS executable), or use the source code for 2.6.i, but compile it using
the makefiles that have the .usa suffix, rather than the ordinary makefiles.
These files define the USA_ONLY option, which means that you will get a
version that is identical to MIT PGP 2.6.1 and thus legal to use within the
USA. You will then also need to compile the files in the rsaref directory.


DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PGP 2.6.i AND 2.6.1

If you compile PGP 2.6.i without the USA_ONLY option, or if you are using the
precompiled DOS-version of 2.6.i, you should note that your copy of PGP will
differ from MIT PGP 2.6.1 in the following ways:

  (1) It identifies itself as version 2.6.i

      This is to clearly distinguish it from PGP 2.6.1. This is important
      because users within the USA are not allowed to use PGP 2.6.i, and also
      because script files, shells and other PGP add-ons may need to know
      exactly how your copy of PGP will behave under different circumstances.

      (Note: an earlier release of this version was called PGP 2.6i. The
      version number was later changed to 2.6.i to make it clear that it is
      in fact derived from 2.6.1. The new version number should also be less
      offensive, considering the fact that there is already a PGP 2.6ui.)

  (2) The text string "Distributed by MIT. Uses RSAREF." is replaced by
      "International version - not for use in the USA. Does not use RSAREF."

      PGP 2.6.i is not approved or distributed by MIT. All questions regarding
      PGP 2.6.i should be addressed to Stale Schumacher <staalesc@ifi.uio.no>,
      and not MIT, as they have nothing to do with this release.

  (3) It uses PRZ's MPILIB instead of RSAREF

      PGP 2.3a and earlier versions use a special library for all the RSA
      encryption/decryption routines, called MPILIB, and written by Philip R.
      Zimmermann (PRZ), the original author of PGP. However, starting with
      version 2.5, all official releases of PGP have been using the RSAREF
      library from RSADSI Inc, a US company that holds the patent on the RSA
      algorithm in the USA. This change was made in order to make PGP legal
      to use within the USA.

      Please observe that PGP 2.6.i does NOT use RSAREF, but rather PRZ's
      original MPILIB library, which is considerably faster and better on most
      platforms. Because 2.6.i uses MPILIB rather than RSAREF, it is also able
      to verify key signatures made with PGP 2.2 or earlier versions. This is
      not true for PGP 2.6 and 2.6.1, because the RSAREF library only
      understands the new signature format introduced with PGP 2.3a.

      The use of the MPILIB library is the main reason why PGP 2.6.i is
      illegal to use within the USA. If you are in the USA, you should compile
      the source code using the -DUSA_ONLY option or get a copy of the
      original MIT 2.6.1 release.

  (4) It circumvents the "legal kludge"

      PGP 2.6.1 contains a "feature" that will cause it to generate keys and
      messages that are not readable by PGP 2.3a and earlier versions. This
      is the "legal kludge", and was introduced to encourage users in the USA
      to upgrade from PGP 2.3a.

      PGP 2.6.i does NOT have the "legal kludge". This means that messages and
      keys generated with PGP 2.6.i can be used and understood by all existing
      2.x versions of PGP. However, it is still possible to generate keys and
      messages in the new format by specifically setting the legal_kludge flag
      in your config.txt file:

      legal_kludge = on

      This option may also be set on the command line: "pgp +le=on <command>".

      Note: MIT PGP 2.6.1 also has a legal_kludge option, but this can only
      be set on the command line, and it contains a bug that requires you to
      specify more than one parameter for it to work. In PGP 2.6.i, the
      legal_kludge works the way it was intended, although the default setting
      is OFF, not ON.

  (5) It can handle keys as big as 2048 bits

      Originally, PGP was only intended to be able to use key sizes up to 1024
      bits. However, a "bug"/undocumented feature in PGP 2.3a allowed users
      of this version to generate and use keys up to 1280 bits. With the
      release of PGP 2.6, a restriction was added so that keys larger than
      1024 bits were no longer allowed. This resulted in a number of "hack-
      versions" that allowed bigger keys, even as big as 4096 bits.

      PGP 2.6.i allows you to use keys as big as 2048 bits. After 1 December
      1994, it will also be able to create keys of this size. The reason for
      this is that by this time it is likely that most people will have
      upgraded to a PGP version that can handle such keys. If lots of people
      started generating 2048-bit keys now, then this might lead to
      incompatibility problems. It should be said, however, that using keys
      beyond 1024 bits adds very little extra security, but at the same time
      takes much longer when decrypting and signing messages. It is a general
      belief that 1024 bits will still be plenty several decades into the
      future.

      Please remember that users of PGP 2.3a and 2.6.1 cannot encrypt messages
      or verify signatures with keys that are bigger than 1280 bits.

  (6) It fixes a bug in verifying clearsigned messages

      When signing a message in clearsign mode, PGP will add a blank line
      right after the "-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----" header. If someone
      later adds extra lines of text above this blank line, PGP will simply
      skip them when verifying the signature. This makes it possible for
      people to add extra text at the beginning of a clearsigned message, and
      PGP will still give a good signature when verifying it. However, the
      cleartext produced by PGP will not contain the extra text.

      This bug is present in all existing PGP versions except 2.6.i. It will
      probably be fixed in MIT PGP 2.6.2, too.


DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PGP 2.6.i and 2.6ui

A PGP version that has been very popular among non-US users of PGP is 2.6ui.
If you have been using PGP 2.6ui up to now, you should note that PGP 2.6.i
differs from this version in the following ways:

  (1) It is a "real" 2.6 version

      PGP 2.6.i is based on the source code for PGP 2.6.1, whereas PGP 2.6ui
      is based on the source code for 2.3a. This means that 2.6.i contains a
      lot of bug-fixes that are not present in 2.6ui, and it also adds a
      number of new features that 2.6ui lacks. These include the new PUBRING,
      SECRING, RANDSEED and COMMENT options in config.txt.

  (2) It doesn't have the version_byte option

      PGP 2.6ui has an option to allow you to choose which message format to
      use when generating keys and messages. This is the version_byte option,
      and can be set both in the config.txt file and on the command line:

      version_byte = 2    (use backwards-compatible format)
      version_byte = 3    (use new 2.6 format)

      In PGP 2.6.i, the same is accomplished using the legal_kludge flag:

      legal_kludge = off  (use backwards-compatible format)
      legal_kludge = on   (use new 2.6 format)

  (3) It doesn't have the armor_version option

      PGP 2.6ui has an option to let you "forge" the version number in the
      ASCII armored files produced by PGP. In PGP 2.6.i, the armor_version
      option is NOT supported, as this is a feature that is heavily misused.
      If you must change the version number of your keys and messages, you can
      do so in the language.txt file instead.


LEGAL STUFF

PGP 2.6.i is not approved by MIT or PRZ or NSA or the Pope or anyone else.
However, it should be possible to use it legally by anyone in the free world
(i.e. all countries except USA, IRAQ and a few others). Most of the code was
exported illegally from the USA, but once exported anyone may use it freely.
If you are inside the USA, you should compile the source using the -DUSA_ONLY
option, which will in fact give you a version that is identical to MIT PGP
2.6.1.


HOW TO CONTACT THE AUTHOR

All questions regarding PGP 2.6.i should be addressed to Stale Schumacher

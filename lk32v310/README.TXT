NEW IN VERSION 3.1:
- New module KEYCHAIN provides key management functions: view the
  public and secret keyrings, extract keys to files or to the clipboard,
  remove keys, check the fingerprint of a key, generate key pairs, and
  choose the default secret key for making signatures.
- LOCK & KEY will handle multiple files and messages.  Just select 
  multiple files and send to LOCK & KEY.  LOCK & KEY will run KEY32 if 
  the input data contains encrypted files or messages; otherwise, LOCK32
  will be run.
- LOCK32 permits you to compose messages for encryption using your
  choice of editor and template file.
- Updated help file featuring a Lock & Key tutorial and *live* links
  which you can use to access the Web or send tech support mail from the
  Help file.  Now learning to use PGP is easier than ever!
- For greater security, LOCK & KEY now passes the PGP pass phrase to
  PGP without writing it to disk.
- KEY32 now automatically finds encrypted messages and keys in e-mail
  messages, checks formatting and even strips "quoting" characters which 
  some mail programs add to mail messages, making it much easier to decrypt a
  PGP message that has been pasted into e-mail.
- Decrypted messages can be copied to the Windows clipboard.
- LOCK32 provides for the option of preserving the original file name when
  encrypting to the Clipboard.  If the filename has been preserved with
  LOCK32, KEY32 will offer to save the decrypted file using the original
  filename.
- You can now choose the filename for saving decrypted or encrypted messages
  where no filename is provided.  Also, if the filename would overwrite an
  existing file, you are prompted and can choose another filename.
- You may now choose to run PGP normal, minimized (default) or hidden.  
  Right-click on the Help button in Lock32 and choose options.

To install LOCK & KEY, follow these steps:
1.  Unzip all files to a disk or directory.
2.  Run INSTALL.EXE.

LOCK & KEY is written in Microsoft Visual Basic and requires the Visual

file.

LOCK & KEY supports Windows 95 automatic uninstallation.

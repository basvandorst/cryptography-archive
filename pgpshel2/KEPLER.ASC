Here's my public key to add to your key ring and generally play 
around with.  Choose the PGPShell command "Add a Key" to add this
to your public key ring.  If you want to test it out, compose a
message to me telling me what you like and don't like about this
program (don't forget to encrypt it with Radix-64 ASCII!) and 
e-mail me at <still_j@cubldr.colorado.edu>.  Copy your own public 
key and send it to me in the body of your message and I'll
e-mail you back to let you know I got it okay.

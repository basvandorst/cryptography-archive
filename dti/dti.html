<P>On 10 June 1996 I announced to Parliament that the Government would
be bringing forward proposals for the licensing and regulation of
Trusted Third Parties for the provision of encryption services.  I
indicated then that a public consultation document on the Government's
proposals would be issued prior to the introduction of legislation.  I
am pleased to be able to introduce this document to you now.   </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The proposals in this consultation document make a significant
contribution to the Government's overall strategy for building the
information society in the UK.  The provision of secure electronic
commerce is a key issue for business and consumers and it is important
that we take positive steps to address it, if we are to ensure that
everyone in the UK exploits the full potential of information and
communication technologies.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The last 12 months have been a year of intense activity for
Government.  February 1996 saw the launch of the Information Society
Initiative Programme for Business aimed at encouraging British business
to improve its competitiveness by using information and communication
technologies.  December 1996 saw the full liberalisation of
international telecoms facilities in and out of the UK, and the launch
of IT for All - an exciting new programme aimed at bringing the benefits
of the information society within the reach of all UK citizens.  The
Green Paper government.direct set out a vision for the electronic
delivery of Government services.  Whilst the Education Department's
Superhighways Initiative continues to support a series of projects
designed to raise awareness of computer networks in education.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The UK is already a world leader in the telecommunications,
broadcasting and multi media industries.  Business and consumers are
therefore well placed to take advantage of the opportunities on offer. 
Despite this however, significant barriers to the take up of electronic
commerce still remain.  </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>These proposals - aimed at facilitating the provision of secure
electronic commerce -  are being brought forward against a background of
increasing concern, not about the technology, but about the security of
information itself.  In a world where more and more transactions are
taking place on open electronic networks like the Internet, there has
been a growing demand from industry and the public for strong encryption
services to help protect the integrity and confidentiality of
information.  These  proposals have been developed to address those
concerns, but at the same time are aimed at striking a balance with the
need to protect users and the requirement to safeguard law enforcement,
which encryption can prevent.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I believe that the proposals outlined in this paper achieve that
balance.  Their success though will ultimately depend on their
widespread acceptance and use of Trusted Third Parties by the business
community.  We are therefore looking to industry to work with us in
close partnership on this important issue.  </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I therefore urge you now to let us have your comments on this
document.  </P>

<LI>This consultation paper sets out the Government's policy proposals
for the licensing and regulation of Trusted Third Parties (TTPs) to
provide a range of information security services to their clients. 
</LI>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<LI VALUE=1>These proposals stem from the Government's announcement
of 10 June 1996 on the provision of encryption services on public
networks.  This announcement recognised the growing demand from industry
for strong encryption services to safeguard the integrity and
confidentiality of electronic information transmitted on public
telecommunications networks.  It also recognised the need to balance
this demand with the requirement to preserve the ability of intelligence
and law enforcement agencies to fight serious crime and terrorism.  
</LI>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<LI VALUE=1>Against this background the Government announced that it
would be bringing forward proposals for the licensing and regulation of
TTPs to provide a range of information security services to their
clients.  It also indicated that formal  consultation on the
Government's proposals would be undertaken by the Department of Trade
and Industry with all interested parties, prior to the bringing forward
of legislation.  Since June 1996 the Department of Trade and Industry,
together with other government departments, has been concentrating on
the detail of the legislation required to licence TTPs.  This paper
outlines the Government's proposals and seeks comments on their
suitability and scope.  Following this consultation the Government will
make a further statement indicating how the legislation is to be brought
forward, and giving further details of the intended regulatory regime.
</LI>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<LI VALUE=1>This paper comprises seven sections.  Section I introduces
the paper.  Section II outlines the overall policy framework within
which the Government's policy on TTPs has been developed.  Section III
outlines international activity being considered by the European
Commission on information security, including the promotion of TTPs.  It
also outlines discussions on similar issues taking place within the
OECD.  Section IV discusses cryptography and the role it has to play in
securing the confidentiality and integrity of data.  Section V outlines
the potential benefits of a TTP network in the context of information
security and indicates the range of  services that TTPs might provide. 
Section VI outlines the structure of the Government's proposals and
seeks comments on the areas it considers necessary to cover as the basis
for legislation.  Section VII highlights those issues on which the
Government would particularly welcome comments. </LI>

POLICY FRAMEWORK</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>&nbsp;</P>
<LI VALUE=1>The Government's policy on TTPs and the provision of
encryption services for the protection of information transmitted
electronically should be viewed in the context of the Government's
broader objectives for building the information society in the UK. 
</LI>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<LI VALUE=1>The Government's view is that new developments in
information and communication technologies offer exciting opportunities
in the UK.  Advances in the computing, telecommunications and creative
sectors, combined with the world-wide explosion of electronic commerce,
are revolutionising the delivery and availability of information and
services.  The Government wants to ensure that everyone in the UK is
able to benefit from these developments and that they are able to play a
part in the emerging information society.  </LI>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<LI VALUE=1>The UK is already a world leader in telecommunications,
broadcasting and multimedia - benefiting from Government action to
liberalise the market and promote competition.  Both business and
consumers are therefore well placed to take advantage of the
opportunities on offer.  For example, many firms are already finding
that their ability to make effective use of new information and
communication technologies is crucial to their performance.  Indeed the
increased use by British business of information technology over the
last decade has been a major factor in their improved competitive
position in global markets.</LI>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<LI VALUE=1>Within this framework the Government has an important role
to play in providing leadership in certain key areas.  These include:-
</LI>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>a) Creating the right regulatory framework so that industry and the
economy can flourish, while assuring proper protection for the
public.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>b) Promoting appropriate use of new technologies - in schools and
colleges, museums and libraries, in the health service and in all areas
of public life.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>c) Using information technology to improve efficiency in Government
and the effectiveness of the services it delivers to industry and the
public.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>d) Acting as a catalyst for new developments, bringing people
together and working in partnership with the private sector and local
authorities to make things happen.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<LI VALUE=1>The Government has adopted a national strategy for the
information society - the <B>Information Society Initiative</B> - which
seeks to include and enrol everyone in the UK through a number of
complementary initiatives applying across all sectors of society.  </LI>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>-&#9;IT for All</B> - a programme which offers the public a wide
range of &#9;opportunities to try and more readily understand
technologies.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><I><P>-&#9;Programme for Business</B></I> - where business and
commerce are provided with &#9;wide- ranging resources, support and
funding to help them thrive in the &#9;emerging information based
economy.  </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><I><P>-&#9;government.direct </B></I>- a recent Green Paper which
sets out a vision for the &#9;electronic delivery of Government
services, making them more accessible, &#9;more available and easier to
use.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>-</B>&#9;The <B><I>Education Department's Superhighways
Initiative</B></I> which supports a &#9;series of projects designed to
raise awareness of computer networks in &#9;education and show how they
can best enrich the delivery of education.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<LI VALUE=1>The growth in electronic commerce offers great
opportunities for the business community and consumers.  The Government
recognises however that it also brings with it significant risks.  In
particular, the ability to conduct all kinds of  transactions across
open information and communication networks like the Internet has led to
increasing concern about the security of the information itself.  In
this context, businesses in particular have raised legitimate concerns
about the adequacy of security measures for protecting the integrity and
confidentiality of information transmitted on public telecommunication
networks.  It is clear that increasingly the concerns of users are not
only about the availability of the technology and its benefits, but
about the level of trust that both business and the public can place in
such technology.  These concerns represent a significant obstacle to the
continued take up of electronic commerce in the UK.  Hence the issue of
how best to facilitate the provision of secure electronic commerce has
become a key component of the Government's objectives for building the
information society. </LI>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<LI VALUE=1>One of the most effective security tools for protecting
the integrity and confidentiality of information transmitted on open
electronic networks is cryptography.  Over the last 2 years there has
been a growing demand from industry for strong encryption services on
communications networks and the Government recognises that this can help
solve some security problems.  In developing a policy in this area
however the Government has to take many different interests into
account.  For example, a  significant area for consideration in this
context is how the spread and availability of encryption technology will
affect the ability of the authorities to continue to fight serious crime
and terrorism, and protect UK economic well being and national security.
 In particular, the Government considers it essential that the ability
of security, intelligence and law enforcement agencies to conduct
effective legal interception of communications under the Interception of
Communications Act 1985 is preserved in any policy proposals.   Another
key area in developing this policy is the need to ensure the privacy of
individuals.  That is why the Government is in favour of developing a
policy that will facilitate the use of cryptography for everyone.  The
rights of individual privacy will be strongly safeguarded by the
technology made available, and the tightly controlled legal access
conditions that these proposals wish to introduce. </LI>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<LI VALUE=1>It is the need to strike a balance between the commercial
requirement for robust encryption services, with the need to protect
users, and the need to safeguard law enforcement and national security
requirements which led to an announcement by the Government in June 1996
of its policy towards encryption services on public networks.  It is on
the basis of the policy outlined then that the detailed proposals
outlined in this paper- for the introduction of  legislation to license
TTPs wishing to provide a range of encryption services to their clients
- are now being brought forward. </LI>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<LI VALUE=1>Whatever services TTPs provide, they must be trusted by
their clients. Indeed in a global trading environment there will have to
be trust of, and between, the various bodies fulfilling this function.
To engender such trust, TTPs providing encryption services to the
general public will be licensed.  The licensing regime will seek to
ensure that organisations who wish to establish themselves as TTPs will
be fit for the purpose.  It will aim to protect consumers as well as to
preserve the ability of the intelligence and law enforcement agencies to
fight serious crime and terrorism by establishing procedures for
disclosure to them of the encryption keys, under safeguards similar to
those which already exist for warranted interception under the
Interception of Communications Act 1985.</LI>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>SECTION III:&#9;EUROPEAN UNION
&amp; OECD DEVELOPMENTS</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>&nbsp;</P>
</B><LI VALUE=1>The Government's initiative on TTPs will be of much
greater significance for industry if similar developments take place in
the countries of our main trading partners.  The development of
encryption services via TTPs requires compatible mechanisms in other
countries and the UK has been active in promoting the concept through
both bilateral and multilateral contacts. Within Europe the main forum
for discussion on such issues is the European Union, in particular the
European Commission where DG XIII has a small unit dedicated to
information security issues.   </LI>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<LI VALUE=1> In 1992 a Committee of Member States on information
security issues (known as SOG-IS) was established as a forum for Member
States to advise the Commission on the sort of initiatives that might be
appropriate in this field.  This resulted in a programme of work on
information security including the adoption of the ITSEC criteria (first
developed by the UK, France, Germany and the Netherlands) and the first
pilot projects involving the use of Trusted Third Parties for digital
signature services.  In August 1994 the Commission Services began
developing a proposal for a further programme of work concentrating this
time exclusively on the development of Europe-wide network of Trusted
Third Party Services (ETS) for the provision of cryptographic key
management services (for both confidentiality and integrity).   </LI>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<LI VALUE=1>The Commission's proposal was the subject of lengthy
debate by Member State representatives, both in terms of the relative
role of the member States and the Commission in introducing such pan-EU
services and the law enforcement and national security issues pertaining
to confidentiality services.   As a consequence, and due to other
priorities, the Commission's proposals have been delayed.  It is hoped
however that there will be a policy announcement in 1997.   In the
meantime the Commission is sponsoring work on a number of pilot projects
concerning Trusted Third Parties in the ETS Preparatory Programme.  Of
the eight projects recently funded by the Commission, UK companies are
involved in seven.  The Government will be closely monitoring
developments on these projects to learn lessons for its own licensing
regulations.  </LI>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<LI VALUE=1>It is recognised that complementary European Commission
initiatives on Trusted</LI>
<P>Third Parties would be appropriate to enable an EU wide network of
TTPs to be established.  The Government has therefore, been working
closely with the European Commission on the scope and content of
applicable measures.  The Government,  in concert with other European
countries, has recommended that the Commission adopt measures to
demonstrate, trial and pilot TTP projects which would underpin the EU
wide development of encryption services through TTPs. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<I><LI VALUE=1>Information on any of the current TTP projects can be
obtained from David Herson (DG XIII/7) at the European Commission
(e-mail  <A HREF="mailto:david.herson@bxl.dg13.cec.be"> david.herson@bxl.dg13.cec.be
</A>) or from the Commission Web site at <A
HREF="http://www.cordis.lu/infosec/"> www.cordis.lu/infosec/ </A> </LI>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</I><LI VALUE=1>The other main international forum for the discussion
of cryptographic policy has been the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD).   The OECD has taken an interest in
information security issues for a number of years and in December 1995
hosted a landmark conference between industry and Government.  This
conference indicated that both international co-operation between
Governments, as well as close co-operation between government and
industry, would be key in developing acceptable and forward looking
encryption policies.  The OECD therefore decided to establish an Expert
Group to look specifically at the development of cryptography guidelines
as a direct guide to national policy development in member countries. 
The Expert Group met four times in 1996 and in December agreed a draft
paper on Cryptography Guidelines for OECD consideration.  This paper is
currently being considered by member countries and will hopefully be
issued as an OECD Recommendation to member countries in late Spring
1997. </LI>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<LI VALUE=1>In terms of content, and with regard to OECD
confidentiality, the paper outlines eight key principles which any
national encryption policy (including industry's development of
products) should observe. These are <B>Trust in Cryptographic
Methods</B> (vital if they are to be used),<B> Choice of Cryptographic
Methods</B> (allowing the user to chose from a variety of systems),
<B>Market Driven Development of Cryptographic Methods</B> (noting that
it is primarily for the market, rather than Governments, to bring
forward solutions),<B> Standards for Cryptographic Methods</B> (which
should be promulgated in an open way), <B>Protection of Privacy and
Personal Data</B> (the importance of individual privacy), <B>Lawful
Access</B> (outlining the Government's right to legally access data
-whether or stored or in transmission - and encryption keys),
<B>Liability </B>(which the TTP must take on) and<B> International
Co-operation</B> (stressing the need for countries to work together on
global, rather than national, solutions).</LI>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<LI VALUE=1>The OECD exercise has gained considerable public exposure
and the Government hopes that the guidelines, when published, will make
a major contribution to the goal of developing global encryption
services of direct benefit to business whilst safeguarding individual
privacy and the national security concerns of member countries. </LI>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<LI VALUE=1>In addition to activities within the EU and OECD, a number
of other fora and groups are also working on related encryption
initiatives.   In Europe, the Council of Europe has recently developed
guidelines on Computer Crime, specifically noting the adverse role
cryptography could have in hampering investigations.  In the context of
standards, both regional and global groupings are producing encryption
standards.   In Europe ETSI are developing a specific standard for
Trusted Third Parties while SC27 (part of ISO) are developing a specific
standard for digital signature and encryption methods.  In addition, the
UN (through UNCITRAL) and the American Bar Association (ABA) are
developing, and the EU considering the development of, digital signature
guidelines.</LI>
<I><P>&nbsp;</P>
</I><LI VALUE=1>Individual countries both in and outside Europe are
also developing their own national approaches.   Whilst the US, France
and the UK are perhaps unique in having policies on Trusted Third
Parties involving key escrow, Germany has introduced a draft Digital
Signature Law, Canada is developing a Federal Public Key Infrastructure,
and Australia is developing a national Public Key Authentication
Framework.<B>   </LI>

IV:&#9;CRYPTOGRAPHY</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>&nbsp;</P>
<LI VALUE=1>Cryptography is the art or science of keeping a message
secure.  It can be used to hide its information content, establish
authenticity, prevent undetected modification, prevent repudiation,
and/or prevent unauthorised use. </LI>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<LI VALUE=1>Cryptography can be used to protect the confidentiality of
data, such as financial data or personal records, whether it is in
storage or in transit. Cryptography can also be used to verify the
integrity of data by revealing whether it has been altered and
identifying the person or device that sent it. These techniques are
critical to the development and use of national and global information
and communications networks and technologies, as well as the development
of electronic commerce. </LI>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<LI VALUE=1>The development of information and communications
technologies that allow vast quantities of data to be transmitted,
copied and stored quickly has promoted a growing concern for the
protection of privacy and confidentiality of data. Effective
cryptography is therefore an essential tool in a network environment for
protecting the privacy of personal information and the secrecy of
confidential business information. </LI>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<LI VALUE=1>Encryption uses a mathematical algorithm to encrypt data
in order to render it unintelligible to anyone who does not possess
certain secret information (cryptographic key) necessary for decryption
of the encrypted data.  Traditionally the secret cryptographic key needs
to be agreed in advance of any communication. The secret key is used to
both encrypt and decrypt the message. The security of this type of
encryption lies in protecting the key; divulging it would allow anyone
to decrypt the message. Therefore great care needs to be taken to
protect the key, and therein lies the difficulty of adopting such a
system for widespread use - how to protect the key and at the same time,
distribute it to those you wish to communicate with. </LI>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<LI VALUE=1>In the mid 1970s a new development in cryptography
introduced the &quot;public key&quot; concept, which allows parties to
exchange encrypted data without communicating a shared secret key in
advance.  Rather than sharing one secret key, this concept uses two
keys: a &quot;<U>public key</U>&quot; that can be disclosed to the
public and used to encrypt data, and a corresponding &quot;<U>private
key</U>&quot; that is kept secret and used to decrypt the data.  Another
important use of public key cryptography is &quot;digital
signature&quot;, which is used to verify the integrity or the sender or
data.  In this case, the private key is used to sign a transmission,
while the corresponding public key is used to verify a signature. </LI>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<LI VALUE=1>Public key cryptography offers the benefits of
confidential transmissions and digital signature in an open network
environment in which parties do not know one another in advance, and
without the need to share secret key information. The Government
believes this is vital for electronic commerce between trading partners
who may, of course, not know each other.</LI>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<LI VALUE=1>For a public key system to work in the public domain, not
only must the public key be freely accessible, but also the user must
have a reliable way of verifying the authenticity of public keys. Such
an infrastructure, for managing and certifying public keys, can be based
on a hierarchy or network of certificate authorities or Trusted Third
Parties.  A TTP would be a <U>trusted</U> source of information about
the keyholder in the form of a &quot;public key certificate&quot;. The
certificate could be used to verify certain information exchanged over a
network. </LI>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<LI VALUE=1>However, the widespread use of cryptography raises other
important issues, and cryptography policy should, therefore, balance a
number of varied interests. In addition to its role in the operation of
electronic commerce, cryptography has implications for the protection of
privacy, intellectual property, business and financial information, as
well as law enforcement and national security.</LI>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<LI VALUE=1>A critical issue presented by cryptography is the possible
conflict between privacy and law enforcement.  While the use of
cryptography is important for the protection of privacy, it can also be
put to improper use such as hiding the illegal activities of criminals
and terrorists. Consequently, there is a requirement to establish
appropriate mechanisms for lawful access to encrypted information. In
the UK, security, intelligence and law enforcement agencies can lawfully
intercept communications under certain conditions in accordance with the
Interception of Communications Act 1985 (IOCA).  Unfortunately, the use
of cryptography has the potential to seriously hamper this important law
enforcement tool, by making legally intercepted messages unreadable, to
the detriment of all law abiding citizens.  Private parties may also
have legitimate reasons and a legal basis to obtain access to encrypted
information. For instance, an employee who has encrypted files may
resign without leaving information concerning the private key, or the
death of an individual may require a Solicitor to have access to their
encrypted information.  In all of these circumstances TTPs can enable
legitimate access to the keys to unlock such information.</LI>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<LI VALUE=1>Legal access can be achieved by making use of a key
escrow/recovery system. Key recovery allows authorised persons (for
example users, officers of an organisation and law enforcement
authorities) under certain conditions, to decrypt messages with the help
of cryptographic key information, held in escrow, and supplied by one or
more trusted parties.  In such cases legal access is to the private
confidentiality key.  </LI>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<LI VALUE=1>Another important issue is the fact that cryptographic
products and technology are also subject to export controls.  The UK,
and all EU member states, are bound by the Council Regulation (EC) No.
3381/94 linked to the Council Decision No. 941/942 CFSP. The
introduction of these TTP proposals will hopefully lead to relaxed
export licensing procedures for cryptographic products used with
TTPs.</LI>
<B><P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>SECTION V:&#9;&#9;TRUSTED THIRD
PARTIES</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>&nbsp;</P>
</B><LI VALUE=1>A TTP can be described as an entity trusted by other
entities with respect to security related services and activities. A TTP
would be used to offer value added services to users wishing to enhance
the trust and business confidence in the services they receive, and to
facilitate secure communications between business trading partners. TTPs
need to offer value with regard to integrity or confidentiality and
assurance of the services and information involved in the communications
between business applications. A user in the UK, under these proposals,
would be free to choose their own TTP. </LI>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<LI VALUE=1>Typically, a TTP will be an organisation, licensed by the
DTI, which will provide encryption services to a wide range of bodies
across all sectors. The use of a TTP is dependent on the fundamental
requirement that it is trusted by the entities it serves to perform
certain functions. A TTP can also assure the user of the trustworthiness
of another user to the extent that they are who they claim to be.  </LI>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<LI VALUE=1>In practice, TTPs could exist in both public and private
domains, at the local, national and international level. TTPs should
have trust agreements arranged with other TTPs to form a network, thus
allowing a user to communicate securely with every user of every TTP
with whom his TTP has an agreement. The proposed legislation is solely
concerned with licensing those TTPs offering services to business and
the public and not intra-company TTPs.  TTPs, as noted above, are
required to interwork and therefore a key management architecture is
required to facilitate both the cross certification of keys and legal
access requirements.  The minimum functional requirements the Government
considers suitable for such an international TTP architecture are
outlined at <U>Annex E</U>.     </LI>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<LI VALUE=1>Some of the commercial and business benefits of a Licensed
TTP solution are:-</LI></OL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<UL>
<B><LI>TTPs are being licensed to protect the consumer -  </B>Users will
need to be protected from sub-standard TTPs.  Users must also be assured
of a TTPs trustworthiness, technical ability, financial stability,
confidentiality of operations and ability to take legal liability for
their actions.</LI></UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<UL>
<B><LI>TTPs will be able to offer interoperability of secure services
hitherto unavailable - </B>While encryption products are available in
the UK domestic market, interoperability between different products is
not possible. A lack of standards for algorithms and interfacing,
coupled with the high burden of key management has created a fragmented
market.  Today's encryption market is thus very costly. Passing the
key management to TTPs and building products to a common architecture
will allow access to cryptography for everyone with a PC.  Encrypted
communications, therefore, will no longer be limited to Governments and
larger organisations.     </LI></UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<UL>
<B><LI>TTPs will allow UK Business to take advantage of secure
electronic trading- </B>The wide availability of cryptography will allow
more paper based transactions to be conducted electronically.  Time
stamping, non repudiation, confidentiality, authentication and integrity
are all necessary to install trust in the electronic age and to allow
electronic contracts to take the place of paper ones.</LI></UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<UL>
<B><LI>TTPs will also be able to offer Data recovery Services - </B>At
present, if encryption keys are lost, stolen or deliberately withheld by
disaffected employees then the information will remain encrypted and may
be lost to its owner for ever. TTPs will be in a position to offer
recovery of the keys to their clients as they will store (or escrow) the
keys.  </LI></UL>

<B><P>&nbsp;</P>

<UL>
<LI>TTP Encryption policy will help UK manufacturers to export robust
encryption within their products -  </B>Products that are designed to
operate within a TTP environment will be subjected to simpler export
licence procedures, thus allowing them to be exported with minimum
restrictions. This increased availability will stimulate a greater
demand for encryption products both in the UK and foreign markets. UK
companies should be in a good position to take advantage of
this.</LI></UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<UL>
<B><LI>Use of licensed TTPs is voluntary - those wishing to do otherwise
are at liberty to do so -</B> The market will decide if it wants to use
TTP services and not Government. The Government believes that the
benefits of this scheme will far outweigh any others. Of course those
wishing to use any other cryptographic solutions can continue to do so,
but they will not be able to benefit from the convenience, and
interoperability of licensed TTP services.   </LI></UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<UL>
<B><LI>UK taking lead in very important area - </B>Many countries are
currently trying to develop a cryptographic policy. Many countries agree
with the UK that widespread use of cryptography must not be to the
detriment of law enforcement requirements.  The Government believes that
this scheme is the best way to achieve this balance and that other
countries may also see the benefits and follow the UK lead.</LI></UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<UL>
<B><LI>Help to increase the Volume of electronic trading -</B>
Transactions over the Internet are forecast to reach as much as &#163;
22 billion by 2005. Some research suggests that the Internet will take 5
-10% of all retail traffic by 2000. Various barriers (lack of security
products and standards, and poor interoperability) may impede this
growth. The introduction of TTPs should help in this respect.

THE PROPOSALS</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>POLICY CONSIDERATIONS</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P></DIR>

<OL>

</B><LI>The policy considerations for HMG which have determined the
scope and content of the proposed legislative headings which follow are
outlined below:- </LI>
<B><P>Positive Licensing regime  </P>
</B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Government believes that the <B><I>positive (and individual)
licensing of TTPs</B></I> (i.e. the body being licensed before the
service can be provided) is critical in allowing the initial assessment,
monitoring and regulation of a TTP that would meet the requirements of
consumer protection, trust in the market and security, intelligence and
law enforcement access.   Consumer trust and acceptance are paramount as
it is anticipated that licensed TTPs will form the back bone of the
Public Key Infrastructure in the UK  which, in itself, is a critical
requirement for the growth of secure electronic communication.  Such
licensing arrangements will, therefore, also apply to TTPs solely
providing public key certification services.   </P>
<LI VALUE=1>The Government has considered other routes such as
negative licensing (where bodies would be free to provide encryption
services unless they breached pre-set licensing conditions) and
(e.g. intra-company TTPs)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</B><LI VALUE=1>The TTP legislation will <B><I>not</B></I> require
intra-company TTPs (i.e. organisations supplying encryption services to
their own employees or those within their own Group<SUP>  </SUP>of
companies) or similar closed user groups, to be licensed.  However, if
within such a closed community an intra-company TTP wishes to extend its
services beyond the members of the group or, if it wishes to
interoperate with a licensed TTP, a licence will be required.  </LI>
<LI VALUE=1>Encryption services as an integral part of another service
(such as in the scrambling of pay TV programmes or the authentication of
credit cards) are also excluded from this legislation.</LI>
<B><I><LI VALUE=1>The Government invites views on whether the
suggested scope of an exclusion from licensing for intra-company TTPs is
appropriate in this context. </LI>
</I><P>Electronic signatures </P>
</B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<LI VALUE=1>Various national and international bodies are currently
considering a number of issues concerning the legal recognition of
electronic signatures.  For example, a note on the recommendations
contained in a recent report by the Society for Computers and Law on
digital information and the requirements of form generally is at
<U>Annex A</U>.  In the UK, research has shown that uncertainty as to
the legal effect of using electronic commerce is seen by the business
community as a considerable barrier to its development.  In particular,
there is uncertainty as to whether a requirement in law for a signature
can be met using electronic technology.  The Government is currently
considering how best to ensure that requirements of form laid down in
statute law can be met electronically.  This is likely to be a massive
undertaking as it involves reviewing all existing legislation to
identify those cases where use of electronic technology would not meet
legal requirements of form.</LI>
<LI VALUE=1>Two separate issues which need to be considered are how
the identity of the signatory of a document and the integrity of a
document may be proved in legal proceedings in the UK.  These issues may
arise where a digital document is admissible in court and where digital
signature satisfies relevant legislation. Parties to encrypted documents
may be able to agree between themselves as a matter of contract law that
they will accept a certificate by their TTP as to these matters in any
action against each other over the contract.  This would not however
bind a third party and would not necessarily assist if the validity of
the contract were challenged.</LI>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<LI VALUE=1>The Government would welcome views on whether this
legislation should establish a rebuttable presumption in any proceedings
that a document has been signed by the person or persons named in a
certificate issued by a licensed TTP who has provided encryption
services in relation to that document.  A similar presumption could also
apply to the certification by a licensed TTP of the integrity of a
document.  This would have the effect of placing the burden of proof on
a person wishing to challenge the identity of a signatory of a document
or the integrity of a document.</LI>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<I><P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><LI VALUE=1>The Government invites views on whether, in the short
term, it would be sufficient for business to rely on agreements under
contract regarding the integrity of documents and identification of
signatures; or whether it would be helpful for legislation to introduce
some form of rebuttable presumption for the recognition of signed
electronic documents. </LI>
</I><P>Convention on key exchange to underpin TTP legislation </P>
</B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<LI VALUE=1>Although the legislation will require foreign TTPs
offering or providing encryption services to clients in the UK to have a
registered base in the UK (which will allow for the licensing of non-UK
bodies with no trading presence in the UK), there will be no provision
requiring UK clients to use a UK licensed TTP. They are, and will be,
free to register with foreign TTPs. It will therefore be necessary (for
law enforcement purposes)  to establish arrangements with other
countries for the exchange of keys. The UK Government believes that
these arrangements will be on the basis of dual legality i.e. whereby
the criteria for access is satisfied in both countries.  The keys held
by UK licensed TTPs will not, under this legislation, be permitted to be
disclosed to the authorities of other countries unless such requests
satisfy UK law and are authorised by the competent UK authority.   A
fuller description of such arrangements is at <U>Annex B</U>.  </LI>
<B><I><P>&nbsp;</P>
</I><P>Licensing Criteria &amp; Conditions   </P>
</B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<LI VALUE=1>It is intended that the licensing conditions, as opposed
to the criteria on which licences will be granted, will not be
prescribed in the legislation.</LI>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>LEGISLATIVE HEADINGS</B> </P>
<B><P>Licensing Regime</P>
</B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<LI VALUE=1>The legislation will provide that bodies wishing to
<I>offer</I> or <I>provide</I> encryption services to the <I>public</I>
in the UK will be required to obtain a licence.  The legislation will
give the Secretary of State discretion to determine appropriate licence
conditions.</LI>
<LI VALUE=1>The DTI has been chosen as the initial authority for the
licensing, in view of its experience in licensing telecommunications
operators.  Further consideration will be given to whether the on-going
enforcement task in relation to these licences will also be handled by
the DTI, or whether it will be delegated. The legislation will include
provisions to allow both licensing and on-going enforcement to be
delegated to a responsible designated body. More detail about the
structure of the regulatory arrangements will be included in the further
statement referred to in paragraph 3 above.</LI>
<LI VALUE=1>The duration of licences will be a minimum of five years.
Licence fees will be payable both on the grant of a licence and annually
thereafter to meet the cost of their issuing and enforcement.</LI>
<B><I><P>&nbsp;</P>
<LI VALUE=1>The Government invites views on the appropriateness of
these arrangements for the licensing and regulation of TTPs. </LI>
</I><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Licensing Criteria &amp; Conditions </P>
</B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<LI VALUE=1>As noted above the DTI or a designated body will be
responsible for determining, and enforcing compliance of TTPs with, the
licensing conditions.  DTI will consult with other government
departments and organisations on the practical, legal or technical
details as necessary. </LI>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<LI VALUE=1>Before the Licensing Authority will deem an organisation
fit to receive a licence to provide encryption services, it will need to
be satisfied as to, inter-alia:-</LI></OL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<UL>
<LI>competence and trustworthiness of information security
personnel</LI>
<LI>competence and trustworthiness of directors</LI>
<LI>competence of information security management </LI>
<LI>technical assurance of IT security equipment used for key management

<LI>adherence to quality standards and procedures</LI>
<LI>adequate liability cover</LI>
<LI>ability to meet legal access conditions </LI>
<LI>the TTP's business plan and longevity of interest in market</LI>
<LI>isolation of TTP function from other business functions</LI>
<LI>interface requirements to other Licensed TTPs</LI>
<LI>structure and ownership</LI></UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<OL>

<U><LI>Annex C</U> outlines in more detail the thinking behind the above
criteria and seeks comments and suggestions on their appropriateness. A
register of the holders of TTP licences, and the licences issued should
be publicly available.</LI>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<LI VALUE=1>The licence conditions will include such conditions as are
necessary to ensure continued adherence to the licensing criteria.  This
may include-: </LI></OL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<UL>
<LI>provision of quality services to public</LI>
<LI>demonstration of co-operation to authority under legal access
conditions</LI>
<LI>adequate co-operation with other licensed TTPs</LI></UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P><DIR>

<P>The exact scope of licensing conditions applied to a TTP will depend,
inter-alia, on the encryption services being provided.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P></DIR>

<OL>

<B><I><LI>The Government seeks views on the proposed conditions.</LI>
</B></I><P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Exclusions</P>
</B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<LI VALUE=1>Encryption that is used solely in the protection of a
business service (e.g. in pay TV systems or in payment systems), or
encryption services that are provided only to the employees of the
service provider or those in the same group of companies (see footnote
5) are outside the scope of this legislation.</LI>
<LI VALUE=1>For example, a home banking service offered by a bank to
its clients, which included a cryptographic functionality designed to
protect the banking transaction between a client and the bank, would not
be covered by this legislation. However, if the bank  wished to extend
the cryptography's functionality and allow client to client
communications,  then this service would be covered by the legislation,
and the bank would need to apply for a licence.  Another example, of an
excluded service, would be the key management and certification services
that might be offered by providers to credit card companies to
authenticate the users of their cards.</LI>
<LI VALUE=1>Similarly, an employer offering cryptographic protection
between its employees,  (whatever the functionality) would not be
covered by this legislation. However should it decide to extend the
protection service to its suppliers, then it would require a licence. 
</LI>
<LI VALUE=1>In many cases such &quot;intra-group&quot; TTPs are likely
to seek a license given their need to interoperate with organisations
outside their own organisation, or with clients of a licensed TTP.</LI>
<B><I><LI VALUE=1>The Government invites comments on whether specific
exemptions for particular organisations offering encryption services may
be appropriate, depending on the nature of services offered.</LI>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<LI VALUE=1>The Government also invites comments on whether it is
thought desirable to licence the provision of encryption services to
businesses and citizens wholly outside the UK. </I> </LI>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Prohibitions</P>
</B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<LI VALUE=1>The legislation will prohibit an organisation from
offering or providing <I>encryption services</I> to the UK public
without a licence.  Prohibition will be irrespective of whether a charge
is made for such services.  The offering of encryption services to the
UK public (for example via the Internet) by an unlicensed TTP outside of
the UK will also be prohibited.  For this purpose, it may be necessary
to place restrictions on the advertising and marketing of such services
to the public. </LI>
<LI VALUE=1>The legislation will be framed so as to give existing
providers of encryption services time to obtain licences, as TTPs,
before the prohibitions outlined above come into effect.  </LI>
<LI VALUE=1>For the purposes of this legislation the terms
<I>public</I> and <I>encryption services</I> will encompass the
following meanings: </LI></OL>


<UL>
<I><LI>Public </I>will be defined<I> </I>to cover any natural or legal
person in the UK.    </LI>
<I><LI>Encryption services</I> is meant to encompass any service,
whether provided free or not, which involves any or all of the following
cryptographic functionality - key management, key recovery, key
certification, key storage,  message integrity (through the use of
digital signatures)  key generation, time stamping, or key revocation
services (whether for integrity or confidentiality), which are offered
in a manner which allows a client to determine a choice of cryptographic
key or allows the client a choice of recipient/s.</LI></UL>

<OL>

<LI>The legislation will also prohibit a UK licensed TTP from
contracting with any non licensed TTP for the purposes of carrying out
encryption services.  In order to build up a TTP network it may be
necessary from time to time for UK licensed TTPs to recognise
non-licensed bodies from other countries where no licensing regime
exists. In such cases recognition should not be given to an unlicensed
body until the UK licensed TTP is satisfied that such recognition would
not put at risk its ability to meet any of its obligations under this,
or other, legislation, or international obligations (such as those
concerning data protection).  </LI>
<B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Legal Access </P>
</B><LI VALUE=1>The legislation will provide that the Secretary of
State may issue a warrant requiring a TTP to disclose private encryption
keys (protecting the confidentiality of information) of a body covered
by that warrant.  Under such legal access arrangements,  there will be
safeguards broadly similar to those in the Interception of
Communications Act 1985, under which a Secretary of State may issue a
warrant requiring the interception of communications</LI>
<LI VALUE=1>For the purposes of legal access, a central repository
might be nominated or established by the UK authorities.  The purpose of
this central repository will be to act as a single point of contact for
interfacing between a licensed TTP and the  security, intelligence and
law enforcement agencies who have obtained a warrant requiring access to
a client's private encryption keys.  The central repository would,
therefore, be responsible for serving the warrant (whether by physical
or electronic means) on the TTP and distributing the encryption key to
the  appropriate agency.</LI>
<LI VALUE=1> It is envisaged that a warrant would require a TTP to
disclose, in a timely manner, cryptographic key material to a central
repository (acting on behalf of an agency).   <B><I> It is envisaged
that it should take no more than an hour for a TTP, once presented with
a validated warrant request, to deposit the appropriate client
encryption key(s) with the central repository.</B></I> The procedures
and methods to enable such timely disclosure will be determined between
the licensed TTP and the central repository. The costs of obtaining a
warrant and serving it on a TTP, as well as the direct costs of the TTP
complying with such a request, shall be borne by the appropriate agency.
Costs of implementing and maintaining the technical capabilities for
legal access shall, however, be borne by the TTP. </LI>
<LI VALUE=1>In order to comply with the above legal access provision,
TTPs will be required:- </LI></OL>


<UL>
<LI>to have the ability to deliver cryptographic key material by secure
electronic means to a central repository on receipt of a validated
warrant. </LI>
<LI>to demonstrate the ability to recognise a duly authorised warrant
served by the central repository, and to comply only with such a
warrant.</LI>
<LI>to be responsible for facilitating all measures necessary for legal
access. </LI>
<LI>to keep auditable records of legal access requests. </LI>
<LI>at all times, not to deliberately or negligently jeopardise the
integrity of any legal access request, or to disclose the identity of
the target of such a request. </LI></UL>

<OL>

<LI>In addition to disclosure under the <I>Legal Access</I> provisions
noted above the TTP may also release the private encryption key of the
client under contractual arrangements between the two parties.  Such
arrangements may, for example, ensure that keys which have been used to
encrypt company files can be released when the user leaves the employ of
the client company.  Other arrangements allowing third party access by a
solicitor, or other persons, may also be agreed between the parties in
certain circumstances.     </LI>
<B><I><LI VALUE=1>The Government seeks views on whether secure
electronic methods for the delivery of electronic warrants by the
central repository and the subsequent delivery of keys by the TTP should
be introduced. </LI>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<LI VALUE=1>The Government also seeks views on whether the legislation
specifically needs to refer to other forms of legal access including a
civil court order for access to cryptographic keys used to protect
information relating to civil matters such as bankruptcy.</I> </LI>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Sanctions </P>
</B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<LI VALUE=1>It is recognised that in order for business and the public
to have trust in TTPs, some forms of sanction will be required against
those either not complying with the conditions of the licence or, more
seriously, providing encryption services without a valid licence.   On
the latter, we intend that it will be a criminal offence for a body to
offer or provide licensable encryption services to the UK public without
a valid licence.    We consider - again on grounds of consumer
confidence - that it may also be appropriate for the legislation to make
it a specific criminal offence for a licensed TTP deliberately to
disclose a client's private encryption key (or for an employee of such
a TTP to do so), other than pursuant to any legal requirement, or
permission of the client, to do so.    There are, however, existing
provisions (including the Data Protection Act and the Computer Misuse
Act) which would, in some circumstances, already apply to the disclosure
of a client's private encryption key in this respect. </LI>
<B><I><LI VALUE=1>The Government seeks views on whether deliberate
(and perhaps wilfully negligent) disclosure of a client's private
encryption key should be a specific criminal offence, or whether
existing civil and</B> <B>criminal sanctions would suffice.</B> </LI>
</I><LI VALUE=1>Other types of sanction will be necessary for
non-compliance by TTPs with other licence conditions. Such sanctions may
include fines, specific orders issued by the regulator, and (in
extremis) withdrawal of a licence.</LI>
<B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Liability</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</B><LI VALUE=1>TTPs will be liable for the protection of the private
encryption keys of clients at all times while they are in their
possession. They will also be liable for the protection of hierarchical
keys upon which the secrecy of client keys or system keys are dependant.
  In the event of loss or disclosure (whether deliberate or accidental)
of keys the TTP will be required to have in place adequate arrangements
to compensate any loss suffered by its clients or clients of other TTPs.
 The TTP will be required to demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the
Licensing Authority, that such arrangements have been made.  TTPs will
also have vicarious liability for acts of their employees. </LI>
<LI VALUE=1>In order to ensure adequate consumer protection the
Government is minded to impose a form of strict liability on TTPs in
relation to the compromise or disclosure of a client's private
encryption key. A TTP would be strictly liable if such a key was
disclosed other than by agreement with its client (but see paragraph 88
for circumstances in which the authorities have legally obtained the
key). The client would only have to establish disclosure and not
responsibility for such disclosure. It would be a defence for the TTP to
show that the client itself was responsible for the loss or compromise
of his own private keys (whether those for integrity or
confidentiality). Since the TTPs would have strict liability, the
Government also proposes to limit the amount of compensation payable by
TTPs to the client if disclosure (or compromise) of the key was
established by the Court.</LI>
<LI VALUE=1>As the concept of fault (i.e. of either the TTP or another
party (e.g. the central repository) is not an issue in such proceedings
there would also be - in cases of a judgement against a TTP - an
automatic referral to a Tribunal (established under the legislation).  
It would then be for the Tribunal to determine whether there had been
legal access under warrant to the key, and, if so, whether the
responsibility for the disclosure (or compromise) lay with the central
repository or the security, intelligence or law enforcement agencies. 
If so, the Tribunal would order  recompense to the TTP for the loss it
had paid the TTP client and would publish its findings accordingly. 
Liability cover and compensation above the minimum level will be at the
discretion of the TTP and its clients and will  be dealt with by
individual contract.   These arrangements, we believe, balance the
rights of the TTP clients to compensation for loss caused by disclosure
of their private encryption keys, against protection of TTPs from
unlimited liability. </LI>
<B><I><LI VALUE=1>The Government invites comments on whether the
principle of strict liability (as described above) is appropriate in
these circumstances.</LI>
</I><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Appeals and Tribunal</P>
</B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<LI VALUE=1>Careful consideration will be needed of the extent to
which decisions taken about the granting of licences and their
enforcement and amendment should be appealable. The Government sees
merit, in terms of increasing the industry's confidence in the
regulatory process, for some form of appeals body to be created which is
independent of the parts of the Government responsible for licensing and
enforcement.</LI>
<B><I><P>&nbsp;</P>
<LI VALUE=1>The Government seeks views on whether, in principle, an

<P>Legal Recognition of Digital Signatures </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<OL>

</B><LI>The emergence of electronic commerce will, to a large extent, be
determined by the market both in terms of the availability of technology
and the trust business has in it.  Governments can, however, help to
facilitate secure communications by helping to provide the appropriate
regulatory and legal infrastructures.  Apart from the licensing of
Trusted Third Parties, which the proposed legislation will deal with,
Governments may also wish to ensure that electronic communications,
especially when used for electronic contracts, can be legally
recognised.   Although electronic &quot;partners&quot; may well be
prepared to contract with one another on the basis of &quot;trust&quot;
(as many organisations do already) there is a perception that some form
of legislation should underpin the basis of this electronic
communication.  For example, if there were a dispute on the alteration,
or disclosure of a message, recourse to the courts may well be
appropriate.  </LI>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<LI VALUE=1>In recognition of the possible need to introduce new, or
amend existing, legislation to allow for the recognition of digital
transactions, and particularly digital signatures, the Government has
welcomed the work of the Society for Computers and Law. The group,
co-ordinated and facilitated by the Commercial Law Unit at Queen Mary
and Westfield College has examined whether current English legislation
may prevent electronic contracts being enforced; and - if so - what
steps might be taken to address the issue.  It was recognised that
Scottish law, which is different in some respects, would have to be, and
is being, looked at separately.   </LI>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<LI VALUE=1>The Group has now made the Government aware of their
findings on both of the above counts.  To answer the first question the
Group analysed those terms in legislation which pertained to the
transmission of electronic information.  They thus considered whether
the existing usage of words such as &quot;information&quot;,
&quot;document&quot;, &quot;recording&quot;, &quot;writing&quot; and
&quot;signature&quot; had meanings, in their legislative context, which
could extend to digital electronic information.  Basically, they found
that all the above terms, and others, could be extrapolated to cover
electronic information apart from the terms &quot;signatures&quot;,
&quot;writing&quot; and (more obviously) &quot;physical writing&quot;. 
These latter terms, they suggested, had meanings which generally
pertained to the &quot;physical &quot; world of documents and ledgers,
rather than to the electronic one.    Thus they suggested that by
altering, or perhaps extending the general meaning of these words,  it
would be possible for future legislation to be <I>electronic proof</I>
(so to speak).   For existing legislation, however, the Group concluded
that piecemeal change would probably be more appropriate.  This being
based on the vast amount of exiting law which has references to
&quot;writing&quot; and &quot;signatures&quot; in, and the realisation
that some of this body of law may actually require <I>physical</I>
actions (such as a signature in writing for some legal processes). 
</LI>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<LI VALUE=1>In light of these findings, DTI, and other interested
parties, may now wish to  consider whether these measures, or any others
should be taken forward.  Introducing changes to the above terms through
the use of the Interpretation Act (as recommended by the Group) is a
complex matter and would, necessarily require primary legislation. 
Government will also no doubt consider whether, and if so how,  the
further (and perhaps even more difficult) task, of examining the current
legislation - to see where the terms &quot;signature&quot; and
&quot;writing&quot; need  amending, can be taken forward.    </LI>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<LI VALUE=1>These are complex issues and cannot be rushed.  Such
changes will possibly help to underpin secure electronic commerce for a
long time to come.  We cannot afford therefore to get it wrong. </LI>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<LI VALUE=1>The picture is further complicated by the fact that
electronic commerce is global in nature.  The contracting parties will -
possibly in the majority of cases - not both be in this country and
therefore the law of a different jurisdiction may also be relevant.  In
recognition of this a number of different bodies (both public and
private) as well as different Governments, are contemplating issues of
digital signature recognition.  Perhaps the most important is the work
being undertaken by the United Nations Commission on International Trade
Law (known as UNCITRAL).  The latter set up a working party 1995 to try
and develop a &quot;Model Law&quot; which would aid members in
developing compatible and broadly similar legislation.  This being on
the simple basis that issues such as dispute resolution, may be easier
to handle where legislation is broadly similar, rather than totally
different.   The &quot;Model Law&quot; has now been published and has
already formed the basis of legislation in a number of US States.  The
Group's recommendations, noted above, is also broadly compatible with
the UNCITRAL approach.  Work at the UN, however, does not stop with the
Model Law.  A new working group of UNCITRAL has now been commissioned to
look at the process of using digital signatures.  They will be exploring
such issues as the role, and responsibilities of Certification agents,
and how the legal certainty of a signature relates to the technological
process being used to sign data. </LI>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<LI VALUE=1>Another initiative has come forward from the American Bar
Association (ABA) who have produced their own legal guidelines on both
the use and recognition of digital signatures.  The European Commission
has also recently initiated a number of studies of the legal recognition
of digital signatures perhaps as a forerunner  to the emergence of
guidelines of their own. </LI>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<LI VALUE=1>The DTI, and other interested Government Departments, will
take note of these developments in considering what steps we need to
take. </LI></OL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P ALIGN="RIGHT">Annex B:</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>LEGAL ACCESS TO KEYS HELD BY TRUSTED
THIRD PARTIES:</P>
<P>INTERNATIONAL ASPECTS</P>
</B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>1. If the UK and other countries adopt a system of Trusted Third
Parties (TTPs) providing confidentiality services including encryption
on a key escrow basis, it will be open to encryption users to register
with a TTP abroad. Unless workable arrangements are in place for the
authorities to gain access to keys escrowed with TTPs in other
countries, criminals may choose to register with TTPs abroad in order to
evade national legislation providing for access to keys held by TTPs
licensed in their own country.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>2. Direct access to TTPs by foreign authorities would raise a number
of concerns, for example:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<UL>
<LI>the host country might be concerned that access to certain encrypted
data might be detrimental to its national security and economic
well-being;</LI></UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<UL>
<LI>in the law enforcement domain, keys might be sought in connection
with the investigation of offences abroad which would not be serious
enough to justify interception or key access under the host country's
own legislation;</LI></UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<UL>
<LI>any indication that key access might be inadequately controlled
could undermine the confidence of the public and industry in the
integrity and security of TTPs.</LI></UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>3. To meet these concerns the host country's authority would need to
have full information on the foreign authority's case for seeking
disclosure of keys, in order to enable a decision to be taken on whether
or not to serve a warrant on the TTP.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>4. It has been suggested that some of these concerns might be met if,
rather than permitting the release of encryption keys at the request of
a foreign authority, international arrangements provided for the passing
of plain text of decrypted material.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>5. Provision of plain text may be adequate where the need is for
decryption of stored material seized for evidential purposes.
Arrangements for the provision of plain text in such cases might be
pursued through:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<UL>
<LI>bilateral agreements, or;</LI></UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<UL>
<LI>(where plain text is required for evidential purposes) agreements
based on existing arrangements for mutual judicial
co-operation.</LI></UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>6. However, the provision of plain text is unlikely to be practical
where the need is for urgent decryption of intercepted communications or
decryption of stored data to provide time critical operational
intelligence. In these cases arrangements for the release of keys to the
requesting authority would be required.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<U><P>Arrangements for key access</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</U><P>7. Arrangements for lawful key access need to:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<UL>
<LI>create an enforceable obligation on TTPs to disclose keys when
required to do so;</LI></UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<UL>
<LI>protect TTPs from any criminal or civil liability which might arise
from the disclosure of keys.</LI></UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>8. These aims would need to be achieved by national legislation in
the state which has jurisdiction over the TTP's actions. If it is
accepted, as argued in paragraphs 2 - 4 above, that there should not be
a system of automatic recognition of warrants from foreign authorities,
then the legislation would need to provide for the issue of a national
warrant by the competent authority in the "receiving&quot;  state,
within an agreed framework of arrangements for international
co-operation. It is recognised that this sort of procedure will
introduce some delays into the process of obtaining keys, but these
should be considerably less than those which would arise from the
provision of plain text.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<U><P>Criteria</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</U><P>9. The criteria for granting a key access request from another
state might be:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<UL>
<LI>the request has been made by a recognised competent authority in the
"requesting" state (this might be an executive or a judicial authority
according to the law of the requesting state);</LI></UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<UL>
<LI>the request discloses information which satisfies the competent
authority in the receiving state that the release of keys is required
for the prevention or investigation of serious criminal offences, or in
the interests of the national security or economic well-being of the
requesting state;</LI></UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<UL>
<LI>the request satisfies the competent authority in the receiving state
that release of the requested keys would not adversely affect the
national security or economic interests of the receiving state or any
friendly state;</LI></UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<UL>
<LI>the receiving authority is satisfied that there are adequate
arrangements in the requesting state for ensuring that keys are held
securely, not used for purposes other than those disclosed in the
request, and are destroyed when no longer required.</LI></UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<U><P>Form of agreement</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</U><P>10. The international arrangements could be provided for either
by bilateral agreements or a multilateral convention. The commitments
created by any convention should ideally be the minimum necessary to
achieve the desired effect:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<UL>
<LI>states would be required to have legislation in place to enable them
to consider requests for key access from other states which are parties
to the convention;</LI></UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<UL>
<LI>the competent authority to determine a request from another state
should be a matter for national legislation;</LI></UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<UL>
<LI>the authority in the receiving state should not be required to agree
to any request unless the criteria of its national law on key access are
fulfilled;</LI></UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<UL>
<LI>a refusal by a competent national authority to comply with a request
from another state should not be reviewable by any international
tribunal.</LI></UL>

<B><P>3. It should use well known techniques and thus be public and
unclassified.</P>
</B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<I><P>It is recognised that well known techniques are essential for
broad initial acceptance and for subsequent confidence by users,
although there is no direct national security reasons for insisting upon
this. Any truly international system cannot, by definition, rely upon
classified parts. This does not, however, automatically exclude the
system from use in protecting classified information.</P>
</I><P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>4. It should support all forms of electronic communication.</P>
</B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<I><P>One-way communications, such as e-mail, must be included, but any
proposal must be suitable for all forms of communication.</P>
</I><P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>5. It should be compatible with different laws and regulations of
participating countries concerning interception, use, supply and
export.</P>
</B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<I><P>The need for licences or other forms of authorisation is
unaltered, although a successful system should aim to make licensing
arrangements easier for all concerned.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</I><B><P>6. It should provide access under warrant (or other
legally-constituted form of authority) to the data specified in the
warrant, which includes both incoming and outgoing communications.  </P>
</B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<I><P>The warrant would be from a single jurisdiction.</P>
</I><P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>7. It should not impede the due process of law and order. In
particular, it should allow near-real-time access when a warrant is
held. The system must not allow the user to detect that warranted access
is taking or has taken place. </P>
</B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<I><P>The system must cater for lawful access.</P>
</I><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>8. It should give the sender the opportunity to ensure that
legitimate access by the authorities to data specified by the warrant
does not also allow indefinite access.</P>
</B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<I><P>There should therefore be technical and/or procedural means to
enforce the time limits (for access to the appropriate private
confidentiality key) laid down in the warrant.  Such arrangements will
help facilitate the confidence of users.</P>
</I><P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>9. It should provide for the use of a variety of data encryption
algorithms whether in hardware or software.</P>
</B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<I><P>Use of software may not be appropriate for some security critical
applications, but it will inevitably be widely used and must therefore
be catered for.</P>
</I><P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>10. It should not be possible to misuse information obtained under
a warrant to fabricate evidence.</P>
</B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<I><P>Separation between confidentiality and
authentication/non-repudiation is needed, not least to ensure that the
ability of the authorities to decrypt data does not also put them in a
position of being able to impersonate anyone.</P>
</I><P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>11. It should ensure that attempted abuse by the sender can be
noticed by the receiver. </P>
</B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<I><P>It should be impractical for user to subvert or bypass the legal
access provisions. If the recipient contributes to the process of
producing the data encryption key then this applies to both parties.</P>
</I><P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>12. It should not require a user to deal with a Trusted Third
party in another country.</P>
</B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<I><P>Users should be able to choose their own TTP, but any framework
should not force users (on technical or national policy grounds) to deal
with foreign TTPs.  </P>
</I><P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>13. It should not require either regular or on-line communications
between Trusted Third Parties.</P>
</B><I><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>It would be unwise to presume permanent availability of all parts of
a network. TTPs need to provide a timely service, but not necessarily a
24-hour one for users.</P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>Frequently asked Questions and
Answers</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>What is a TTP?</P>
</B><P>An entity trusted by other entities with respect to security
related activities and services.  </P>
<B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Who will use a TTP?</P>
</B><P>Anyone who wishes to have secure communication between two
parties, particularly those that have never met.</P>
<B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Will use of a TTP be mandatory?</P>
</B><P>No.  The market will decide if it wants to use TTP services. 
Those wishing to do otherwise will be at liberty to do so.    </P>
<P>  </P>
<B><P>Who will be able to be a TTP ? </P>
</B><P>Any commercial or non-profit organisation would be eligible
provided that it can meet the appropriate licensing conditions.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>What are the benefits for business ?</P>
</B><P>A network of TTPs, operating to a common architecture should
present significant benefits.  For example, availability and
interoperability of encryption products; a supporting infrastructure
that facilitates international public key certification for
authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality; expensive and complex key
management tasks and secure backup facilities to prevent irretrievable
loss of information.  Secure communication between unknown parties,
without the need to depend on either expensive or multiple solutions,
will become common place and thus lead to increased confidence and use
of the information society.    </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Why should users trust a TTP ?</P>
</B><P>There should be no less reason to trust a TTP than there is to
trust, for example, a bank. A licensing regime will help to ensure that
only reputable service providers are able to become TTPs.   It is
important to note that whilst a TTP will hold private confidentiality
keys in escrow, it  will not normally have access to the encrypted
traffic as this will be sent by the user over whichever telecoms network
he chooses. </P>
<B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Will there be a Government TTP ?</P>
</B><P>Government departments will need TTP services as much as other
organisations,  especially where business is transacted with the public.
</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Why the need for licensing ?</P>
</B><P>Given the position of trust that a TTP would hold, and the
importance its clients will attach to their reliability, some form of
regulation of the activities of a TTP is necessary if only to protect
the public.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Will UK citizens need to register with a UK TTP ?</P>
</B><P>No, but any foreign TTPs offering services in the UK will need to
meet the UK licensing conditions.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Will you attempt to control the length of encryption keys ?</P>
</B><P>No.  For use in the UK that is an issue for the market to
decide.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>What involvement will industry have in the policy process ?</P>
</B><P>As is made clear in Mr Taylor's statement on 10 June 1996, the
DTI will conduct more formal consultation with all interested parties
prior to introducing legislative proposals.  This consultation paper
forms the major part of that ongoing consultation process.</P>
<B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When will legislation be passed ?</P>
</B><P>After this consultation period is complete and at the earliest
opportunity in the legislative programme. Other circumstances
permitting, we hope to bring forward legislative proposals during the
next Parliamentary session.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Are you adopting  a purely national approach ?</P>
</B><P>No.  Electronic commerce is global in nature and the
international perspective needs to be fully taken into account.  The UK
approach is consistent with ideas being discussed in other fora such as
OECD and the European Union.</P>
<B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>How will law enforcement access be achieved ?</P>
</B><P>Where a warrant has been obtained under due process of law, TTPs
holding secret confidentiality keys will be required to release them to
the law enforcement authorities.  </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Will a TTP be able to access an encrypted message ?</P>
</B><P>No.  It is important to be clear that it is not envisaged that
the encrypted communication would  be routed via the TTP. Nor will the
TTP encrypt the message, it will merely assist (depending on the service
offered) in the very complex area of key management or Key
Certification.   </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>If such a system is not mandatory why bother, surely crooks and
terrorists will use something else ?</P>
</B><P>Criminals will often make use of whatever technology is
conveniently available to them.  We expect  TTPs to have a major role in
conveying secure electronic communications, especially where a payment
for legitimate services is involved.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Surely this is just a front for security agencies to expand their
"big brother" role ?</P>
</B><P>No. The UK accepts that businesses have a need to safeguard both
the integrity and confidentiality of their information, and is keen to
find effective means of meeting this need. The TTP approach will provide
such a means, but in a way that would also meet another important need,
namely to preserve the effectiveness of the existing powers to 
intercept communications. Similar safeguards to those that already exist
under the Interception of Communications Act 1985 will be established. 
Widespread encryption has the potential to make legally intercepted
messages unreadable, to the detriment of all law abiding citizens.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>What about export controls - will they be relaxed ?</P>
</B><P>Products for specific use within a licensed TTP network should
not create export difficulties. The fact that they would be for use
under such a system should allow them to be exported with minimum
restrictions being applied.  </P></FONT></BODY>

PGPWave v1.22a Gamma by John Stephenson
PGPWave is an interface to PGP using
simple, well thought out menus. Mainly 
designed for use with offline readers. 
PGPWave is the most advanced PGP shell 
that is to be seen. It uses a exploding
windows interface similiar to BlueWave.
PGPWave is Freeware. It also has many
functions unrelated to PGP. Try it out!

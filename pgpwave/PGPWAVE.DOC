Licence:

  Use at your own risk. This software is conditional freeware. There is 
  absolutely no charge on it for NONCOMMERCIAL uses, the unregistered 
  COMMERCIAL use of this program is strictly disallowed except for
  evaluation of up to and NOT EXCEEDING 30 days. After 30 days the usage
  of this program for COMMERCIAL purposes violates this licence, and
  therefore your right to use this program.
  
  You are a NONCOMMERCIAL user only if you are using PGPWave as a 
  private individual with no "sponsors", "backers", and only if your 
  use is not making (helping to make, or intended to make) you or any 
  affiliates a profit.

  You are a COMMERCIAL user if PGPWave is run by (or for) any 
  corporation, government, foundation, company, or any other 
  organization.
  
  If you qualify as a COMMERCIAL user please see ORDER.FRM detailing
  the cost of registration.
  
    Once I receive the letter with the correct funds, I will then send you 
    a small notice stating you are a registered user, along with a 
    registration code that changes PGPWave to clearly state it is the 
    commercial version. The license you receive is a SITE licence,
    meaning you can run as many copies as you wish on as many machines
    as you wish as so long as all machines are running under your
    same organization.

Requirements:

  You will require a 8086 or above processor. A color video card is highly
  recommended, monochrome is supported. PGPWave requires XMS, EMS, or enough 
  available disk space to swap to disk. In memory PGPWave should take in 
  between 120k and 150k of memory. (PGPWave accolates the memory on the fly, 
  so it can change quite quickly, eg reading in your tagline file can steal 
  quite a lot of memory for other processes)  PGPWave requires your DOS to 
  be compatible with MS-DOS 3.3x+. You must also have the DOS environmental 
  variables "TEMP" or "TMP", "TZ", and "PGPPATH" set correctly.

Features:

 o Smart setup program searches PATH for commonly used programs like Q-Edit,
   DOS's Edit, IBM-DOS's E.EXE, Share Spell, etc and will auto-setup the
   programs in PGPWave.
 o Mouse support is used throughout the program
 o Allows you to seamlessly add signature files to your messages! Allows
   tokens. See token list for more detail.
 o PGPWave will allow you to sign messages
 o PGPWave will enable you to encrypt messages
 o PGPWave will sign & encrypt
 o PGPWave will enable you armour files and messages to a general audience 
 o Will take the ___--- and turn that into a proper ------ and -!- into
   --- before sending it onto PGP. That way you need not change it. (plus
   remove the quote headers)
 o Features a global shell to dos
 o Spell Checker option
 o Simple to use, easily tailored interface
 o Ability to change colors to suit the environment of the calling program
 o Exploding windows (what? You say that isn't a feature?!)
 o PGPWave will wipe temporary files so they can't be simply unerased,
   even with Nortons Unerase.
 o Allows you to wipe messages if you're not satisfied with it.
 o Allows you to change the message after editing, etc.
 o Will allow you to simply interface with the program when possible instead
   of PGP's slightly archaic interface. (eg, typing in the name to encrypt
   from the interface (capitalizing as you go))
 o Nice configuration (all completely menu driven)
 o Swapping to disk, XMS and EMS memory (whatever's up for grabs)
 o Tagline support, supports comments in tagline file using semicolons as first
   characters! Plus allows you to "steal" a tagline (from view message) Also
   allows you to use automatic tagline features. Plus there's alternate
   tagline file support, along with tokenized support!
 o View the message before you send it out to the calling application.
 o Screen saver
 o Export a key, or your entire key ring to the end of the message. Very
   simple to use.
 o Encrypt, and sign and encrypt to multiple people with ease using easy
   to setup and maintain group encryptions or manually!
 o Use multiple private keys.
 o Nice extended info screen.
 o Hot key support in the menu interface.
 o 50 column mode aware. (in fact it's also 25, 28, 43, 58 & 60 column
   mode aware, plus any other "standard" modes)
 o You can edit your taglines, and save them easily.. when you're picking
   them. So you can write & save a custom tagline.
 o Key management utilities
 o Much much more.
 o It's fun! It's *free*!
 o It's got a nice feel, and nice default colour choices :)
 o It's Canadian! (what? You say that isn't a feature?!)

Tokens
~~~~~~
Tokens are little markers saying for PGPWave to replace the tokens
with special text. Tokens will work when passing filenames, or in your
signature file, or taglines. They are simply an @ symbol followed by
a single letter. Here is a listing of the tokens:

 @F - Message filename
 @T - Current time
 @D - Current date
 @P - Product name (in the case of a COMMERCIAL version it will report
      "PGPWave/commercial")
 @U - Will return your name
 @V - Current version of PGPWave
 @R - Current release of PGPWave
 @A - Current author of PGPWave
 @@ - One at sign (@)

Taglines
~~~~~~~~
The tagline file consists a list of single-lined taglines without the
three dots that PGPWave will insert.  There are two special tokens,
[altlist] and [comment] that can be used in your tagline list. If
you use [comment] pgpwave will highlight the text following the tagline
token, and not allow it to be selected as a tagline. If you use [altlist]
PGPWave will highlight that (with a different color) and when you select
it, it will will load that file, if you do not wish the file name to
be displayed, but rather a name that describes what's in the file, then
simply put after the end of the line the comment.

Eg:

[comment]Alternate tagline lists
[altlist]C:\Bwave\Sex.Tag Sex taglines
[altlist]C:\Bwave\Tom.Tag Tom Swift taglines
[altlist]C:\Bwave\Oxymoron.Tag Oxymoron taglines
[altlist]C:\Bwave\Blondes.Tag Blonde joke taglines
[altlist]C:\Bwave\Confucius.tag Confucius sayings taglines

And instead of the path being shown, only the comment will. With BlueWave
it will still be able to utilize this, but the path will be shown along
with the comment. In a few regards, PGPWave's tagline ability is much
stronger and easier to use than Bluewave's.

There are also many other commands to manipulate your taglines, see the
help from the tagline selection box for more detail.

The tokens listed in the section entitled "Tokens" will work with the
taglines themselves, and will be translated and written to your message.

Signatures
~~~~~~~~~~
Signatures in PGPWave are exceedingly easy to use. A signature is a 
small amount of text that is automatically added to each of your 
messages you write. The signature is simply a small text file, but
with PGPWave this can get a little bit more confusing because it
has a lot of power in it.

An example signature would be:

-------------------------- C:\PGP\PGPWAVE\MY.SIG -----------------------------

                                                                  - DarkFire

[@U (DarkFire), Fingerprint: 66BE3A3B6EEE9A5B-48001A32901ECA21]
[Composed at @T on @D using @P v@V @R]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notice the tokens? They are translated when the signature is put on to
the message (see "Tokens" in this manual for further information). (The
signature must contain one line without a token! This is quite important,
or PGPWave will not be able to autodetect if there is a signature already
there!)

Now, go into the setup, and switch on "Add signature to every message",
and also setup the signature filename.

Now that's the most simple way to use signatures, however, if at different
times you need different signatures here is what you do:

In your signature file you can have it setup like this:

[comment]These are my signatures:
[altsig]C:\PGP\PGPWAVE\NIN.SIG Nine Inch Nails conference
[altsig]C:\PGP\PGPWAVE\TAGLINE.SIG Tagline conference signature
[altsig]C:\PGP\PGPWAVE\NORMAL.SIG Normal signature
[altsig]C:\PGP\PGPWAVE\OTHER.SIG Other signature file

The [comment] token works just like the tagline area comment token, and
so does the [altsig] work in the same manner as [altlist]. The text
after the filename is optional, and it's only purpose is to replace
the filename as a description.  Now when you exit, you'll receive a popup
menu to select which of the possible signature is the one you wish to use.
If you don't wish to use any of them, hit escape, if you do, go to it
and hit enter.

Questions & Answers:

Q: How Do I use it?

A: Simple. Install it into C:\PGP\PGPWAVE\, or a similar directory
   In your offline reader configuration where you have your normal editor
   (eg "C:\DOS\EDIT.COM @F") replace with: "C:\PGP\PGPWAVE\PGPWAVE.EXE @F"

   Also you might have to have swapping enabled for the editor (in the setup
   under "swapping"), since PGP requires a *lot* of memory to correctly
   operate. But, try without swapping first.  (Generally if you have 600k of
   ram free you won't need to swap)  Also note that you may have to toy
   around with the paths in the setup options, but PGPWave makes the
   best efforts to automatically find the applications it requires.

   NOTE: If you're not using the PGPPATH and TEMP (or TMP) environmental
         variables you must set them.

   Examples are: Set TEMP=C:\TEMP
                 Set TEMP=D:\
                 Set PGPPATH=C:\PGP
                 Set PGPPATH=C:\UTILS\PGP

   You of course must set it to the correct directories.

Q: Then what do I do?
A: Download a Qwk packet (or Bluewave<tm> packet) and enter some mail where
   ever you wish. Hit "E" for enter or "R" for reply. Now the PGPWave will
   appear, choose either post a key, or use the editor. You can use the arrow
   keys, home, end, page down, and page up or your mouse.

Q: Okay, I've written my message in my editor (or chosen post a key, or
   some other choice), now what should I do?
A: Save it, then (if you wish) spell check it. Then if you feel appropriate
   go to Sign, Encrypt, or Sign & Encrypt. Or simply save it if you don't want
   to use any pgp features on the message.  To view the message that you've
   signed (or key that you've posted) choose Editor again, and maybe add some
   text to it if you feel that you should explain it some more (eg whether
   it's a key etc)

Q: Now..?
A: Choose save and exit (or abort and exit. Note: Abort will wipe the
   message file, and will not be entered in your application, nor will
   it be able to be possibly recovered)

Q: Is this software really free when I see other shareware marked as high
   as $35 (and above)?
A: Yes. You can use (and abuse) this software for any NONCOMMERCIAL
   purpose. If you wish to see any customizations for yourself (eg new
   features (that would not be suitable for every ones use), different
   options, different handling) see ORDER.FRM for the form to send me,
   and in the additional information detail the specific aspects for
   you. I may not be able to design the features you may require, so I
   recommend you send me netmail or a voice phone call telling me about
   what you wish to see added for your specific purpose. Once the changes
   are complete, I will send the finished program to you ASAP.

Q: Is the source code available, if so, is it available for free?
A: Yes, no. Full source code is available for a small amount of money.
   (see ORDER.FRM) I believe in not charging for the use of this work,
   in the spirit of PGP, but I can't justify releasing the source code
   to the application. In case you're wondering, PGPWave is written
   using Borland Pascal v7.0.

Q: I'm sick of typing yes to save etc, is there a better way?
A: Yes. Hit escape twice at the main menu. This will exit, then go with the
   default answer to quitting (yes).

Q: Okay, I know that I can steal a tagline from Bluewave while reading the
   message, but what if I see a tagline inside of the encrypted message, or
   I just realize that it's actually worth stealing?
A: After decrypting, or any time in fact, go to view a message then press
   Alt A. Please note that there's a help screen from the view a message
   in case you get stuck.

Q: My offline reader, or message reader doesn't support taglines or nice
   signatures, and I really think they're neat. What should I do?
A: Simple. PGPWave supports automatic tagline adding, and signatures.
   Simply set the Tagline path to a file that lists one-liner taglines
   without the "..." part, and then enable the "auto add tagline" in 
   the setup menu to "yes". When you're finished with a message you simply 
   exit as usual and it will come up with a tagline prompt. If you do 
   not wish to use taglines, then hit escape, else move to the tagline
   you wish using your arrow keys, then select with enter, or space. 
   If you wish to randomly choose a tagline, then use F8, or F9. F9
   will randomly choose a tagline for you without confirmation. F8
   will just jump to a random tagline, but not select it. F10 allows
   you to make up your own tagline, the default for F10 will be the
   current tagline, ie if you just wish to modify it.
    
Q: I get to a string prompt, and there's a default there. I don't wish
   to hold down my backspace key because that time will be time lost off
   of my life. What can I possibly do?
A: With all input fields, Control Y will clear the field instantly.

Q: Can PGPWave be used with anything other than Bluewave?
A: Yes. I've personally seen it work with other msg utilities, eg GoldEd and
   the BBS Maximus (in fact I run it with Maximus for local logins), and every
   offline reader that allows an external text editor can use this.  Plus it
   will allow you to add taglines etc if the offline read you're using doesn't
   support them. The colours are also customizable.

Q: Okay, this is great software, I understand that it's freeware, but is there
   anything I can do to help you out if I'm not a COMMERCIAL user?
A: Actually no, but next Christmas if you see a salvation army donation pot
   please drop in a dollar. Consider it a donation of good faith, and no..
   I don't believe in God, but I think it's an excellent charity.

Q: So now what?
A: Enjoy it you fool! :-)

   PGPWave on all three systems can be file requested as "PGPWAVE". The
   filenaming convention is: "PGPWxxxy.ZIP" (where xxx is the version, y
   is the release) All three systems either have Guest accounts, or
   first time downloads. Please read over the intro screens of each BBS
   to see if a Guest account is setup.

   To reach me, send me Netmail to Systematic Decline, if that's not an
   option you can call directly and leave mail to me.

   If it's an emergency (note the word just before the left bracket again),
   you can give me a ring at 613-542-1239 (houseline) I will not accept
   collect calls (just remember this is a freeware product..), and if it's
   a serious enough bug I should be able to have a bug fix available within 
   a week, possibly sooner. Commercial users will have precedence over 
   freeware users.

   I also have a mailing address:

   PGP uses a fast counter to count the time between keystrokes, using
these for random numbers.  How strong or weak is this?  Would it be useful
to write some sort of device driver to catch a couple of low-order timer bits
per keystroke?  The device driver could save the pool of random bits each
time a buffer fills, say each 16K bytes.  This seems like, assuming the
low order couple of timer bits are strongly random (it looks that way,
but I could be wrong), you'd be able to build up a pool of strongly random
numbers constantly.

I understand that there was some discussion here within the last couple of months
about the "encryption" used by VCR+.  Can any readers point me to an archive of it,	
or send a copy?	

Does anyone know the protection status of the VCR encoding?  Is it protected as a	
trade secret?  Is there a patent (I presume not, but I don't know) ?

   Hopefully not.
   To contrapositize Bob Cain, use it only on a single user machine.

You are making an unwarranted assumption about unix boxes.  My unix box
at home runs standalone---it's only connected to the world when I
deliberately dial out. I claim that's *at least* as secure as your
"single-user" dos box or mac w.r.t. pgp keys. (Of course, my wife or
daughter could decide to crack my account and give my pgp keys to evil
people. But they could do that on my dos box, too.) Please correct me if
I'm wrong. If I'm right, then porting pgp to unix is not necessarily a
"bad thing."

Bob Cain has a legitimate concern w.r.t. protecting pgp keys. I don't
wish to dilute that, in fact I applaud him for making us all think about
the issue, but "single user" is not quite the right term in this context.

I believe it expires in '96. However, RSA has been giving away source
code and letting people use it for noncommercial purposes. Send mail
to rsaref-administrator@rsa.com for more information.

Note: I am not affiliated with them. I just wanted to use RSA in a
freeware application, and they basically said "okay, you just have to
agree to this and this". "This and this" was quite reasonable, so I'm
happy about it.

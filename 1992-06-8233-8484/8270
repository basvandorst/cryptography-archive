[ This is a ridiculous cross-posting concerning the wizvax anonymous
  posting service for the "alt.sex.bondage" newsgroup.  It seems that
  systems people here are making inquiries on the part of our "authorities"
  (ha ha).  It's being sent to "sci.crypt" for reasons that will hopefully
  become apparent, if you haven't already guessed them. ]

One thing's for damn sure:  authorities around here wouldn't score a 2 on the
"Kevin Buhr Swiftness Scale".  It seems that my glib little comment about
this incident hurting our Net reputation will do more than that.  While I
would most definitely support retaliatory actions against the University,
it would seem I'm chopping off my own hand.

Perhaps the people at wizvax should considering compromising some of their
functionality to further protect the anonymity of the posters.  Currently,
the service is designed to provide a reversible mapping between aliases
and mail addresses:  you can either send a message (with your mail address
in the "From:" line) and have it posted from your alias, or you can send
a message to an alias and have wizvax mail it to the corresponding mail
address.

Maybe a one-way map (from mail address to alias) should be implemented
in place of or in addition to the current service.  This way, people could
post their messages from their real mail addresses and an irreversible (or
practically irreversible) algorithm would convert this address to a
(hopefully unique) alias.  This wouldn't be unlike the basic *nix password
system.

In this way, no one at the wizvax would be able to reveal real names to
the authorities, even if they wanted to.  Only the algorithm would be
kept on the system, no mail addresses or aliases.

It's just a thought...

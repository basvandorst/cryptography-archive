VCR+ has received an European patent, and guess what?  They didn't reveal
the exact algorithm they used.  Instead, they offered examples of various ways
each issue *could* be addressed, and showed example variances that *could*
be applied to each to make it hard to crack.  Based on what we already know,
the specific examples offered (they work through the encoding and decoding
of one particular number) are not exactly what is actually implemented.
But since they claimed such a wide variety of items (lookup tables
are now patented!), what they actually implemented is covered, without
being disclosed.   Clever little sputs.

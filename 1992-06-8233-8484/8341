The problem, expressed by people from several different universities,
is that use of private personal data such as Social-inSecurity-Numbers
for student ids is not only bad for their privacy, it also potentially
violates various Federal laws covering privacy of academic records,
and potentially violates the Privacy Act of 1974, depending on which
courts you listen to, and whether your university is government-funded.

Brian Kantor points out that this approach, in addition to having a
non-zero probability of duplication, makes it easy for someone to do a
brute-force-search on SSNs, building a table of SSN <=> StudentID.
10E9 MD-5 checksums may take a while, but 10E9 CRC-32s should be real quick.

A much simpler method is to resort to the pre-SSN method used by many
universities to assign student IDs, which many companies use for employee-ID:
	start with 100000 or 1000000, and add 1 for each new student.
Guaranteed unique, lasts a long time, and not invertable.
If you want to get fancy, start the Class of 93's numbers with 9300000, etc.
You can also use this for university employees.

To solve the "I forgot my student-id-number" problem,
you can keep a list by name+address (or whatever) for day-to-day use,
and keep a file with more private info such as SSNs, accessible only
to the Head Bureaucrats, to resolve problems like re-issuing lost ID cards
or other sufficiently rare problems that you can waste the Head Bureaucrat's
time by having the student come and grovel :-)

For withholding payroll taxes, or other forms of government extortion requiring
private information, the bureaucrats who do that work are already
authorized to have that information, so they can access the private SSN file.

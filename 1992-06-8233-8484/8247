   Can someone explain to me how a keysearch machine is supposed to work?
I'm assuming it's not just by trying every 56-bit DES key possible against
the ciphertext, since even searching a million keys per second, you'd spend
a couple thousand years searching before you'd exhausted the keyspace.

   I've heard that encrypting a message with one DES key, decrypting it
with a second, and re-encrypting it with a third, is supposed to somehow
come out with a more secure encryption method than one-key DES.  Can anyone
explain this?

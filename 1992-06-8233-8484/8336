Thanks for all the replies I received to this problem, I now have a fair
understanding of how to tackle it.  As one previous poster pointed out,
it really boils down to exchanging two encrypted random numbers and then
exchanging the encryption keys, where the encryption function is
one-way, so that keys cannot be `re-chosen' at a later date. 

I think that for the toy application which prompted me to think of the
problem, one of the pseudo-random number generator methods would be most
appropriate, although for serious applications polynomial based
generators of the form, x(i+1)= f(x(i)) mod N, may be vulnerable to an
attack based on a paper mentioned in comp.compression a short time ago:

J. Lagarias and J. Reeds "Unique extrapolation of polynomial
recurrences", SIAM J. of Computing v. 17 no. 2 pp. 342-362.

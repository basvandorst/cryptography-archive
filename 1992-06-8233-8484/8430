Pardon my first post here, but -- Despite any possible shortcomings in Nico's
RNG, are the random(?) numbers generated by it sufficiently random to
work for a one-time pad?  It seems to me, that these numbers might not
pass all statistical tests, and yet one couldn't reproduce them, which
is the key to a one-time pad, is it not?

Related question -- what possible attacks are there on a one-time pad?
(Other than having a copy of the pad, that is...)

I am a graduate student working on my thesis concerning data
encryption/decryption.  Rather than reinvent the wheel, I was wondering
if C, (or pascal, I'll port), or C++ code implementing the RSA algorithm
and/or the manipulation of large (100 to 200 digit) numbers (MOD, DIV,
etc.)?  This is all peripheral to the problem at hand, and I would
rather not waste time with these points if possible.  A source for me to
refer to would do nicely as well.  Thank you, in advance.

I may be reached at baust@chopin.cs.byu.edu

There was an article with the Wall Street Journal about some problems
one of the casinos had with their slot machines.  They invited a bunch
of high rollers for a special promo.  They thought they had the machines
programmed to pay off at ~95%, rather higher than usual.  Instead, they
actually paid off at ~70%, which is lower than usual.  The crowd got
disgusted, and headed off to other casinos instead.  There's an
investigation now about hardware or software problems...

Is such info in David Kahns book on Enigma?
I suspect it is not, as I don't recall it offhand.
But I think the important thing to remember is that
the Germans made a big mistake: they claimed all along
that the Enigma couldn't be broken, and relied upon it
too much...when indeed, it had been broken.

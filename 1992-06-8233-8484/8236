   It *IS* decrypting data... at least enough for the prosecuting attorney
   to convince a jury of "peers" (meaning no one from s.c).

Doesn't even need to be that good - as long as the cost of an adequate
attorney and some expert witnesses exceeds your cash on hand,
a court case is a major annoyance, especially when you *know* that if
they bust you, they'll send a bunch of cowboys to confiscate lots of your
stuff as "evidence" and tell the judge and jury you're exporting armaments.
I don't blame kocherp for covering himself; as a college student,
even raising bail money to defend yourself against bogus-but-heavy charges
may be difficult, and good lawyers aren't cheap.

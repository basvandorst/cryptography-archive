Gilles Brassard in Montreal has been working on this for a while, and
has a working prototype.  Secure against infinite computational power.
As I put it, The Lorg God Himself, given access only to the channel,
couldn't do better than block communications.

Actually, the quantum channel just provices mostly-shared mostly-secret
bits.  An interloper cannot monitor undetectably, so the communicators
can resolve errors between them, then use the number of detected errors
to compute an upper bound on the eavesdropper's knowledge and throw
away some of the bits to get a shorter, but secure (eavesdropoer's
knowledge limited by 2^-n bits, where n is the number of bits above the
minimum required that are thrown away) shared random bit string.

Then you can use this for one-time pads, secure authentication, etc.

Neat stuff.

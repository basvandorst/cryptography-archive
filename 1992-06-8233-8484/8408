Aw, come on and give this guy a break. I responded to his query with a
pointer to some FTPable code and a reference to some other people I
know to be doing work he'd be interested in. His was a reasonable
request, and it got him some useful answers.

I really do wish people weren't so ready to flame newcomers.

Well, if I remember correctly, the FBI had an encoding scheme for
fingerprint cards that allowed lookup by computer.  As I remember
the type of print, arch, radial/ulnar loop, whorl etc, was encoded and
used along with an ordinal value for the finger on which the print was
found, and I think 3 unique variations on the basic pattern could be
represented as well.

I learned this stuff in 1977, so I am quite rusty on it, but I remember
having to do the encoding according to the FBI standard on some
suspects cards.

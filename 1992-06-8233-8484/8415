No flame, assumption which I don't completely understand but which
seems very valuable.

No flame either, just question to try to understand previous.

Attempt to improve my algo.

Reasons why I think the improvement wouldn't work.

[No flames detected, search stopped]

Please notice I TRY to be funny here. I DON'T want a flame war (and
didn't see one either). I just want as many discussion on my algo
as possible hoping either to confirm it or to prove some way it
fails (and either correct it or give up).

Good thought.

I already mailed the outhor for it. Maybe others are interested?

should be amenable to birthday testing. 

If Nico's generator does indeed approximate to a virtual state machine with 
less than 32 bits of state, then this could be detected by drawing at most a
few hundred thousand samples and counting the number of doubles (and triples 
if any).

I have a preprint on such testing if anybody's interested but the basic
principles should be obvious enough from basic probability theory.

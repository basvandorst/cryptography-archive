Gosh, I think we discussed this about 8 months ago. It can be more
secure as long as the various different encryption systems don't have
any nasty confluences. Here's an extreme version. Imagine A encrypts
with some public key and B decrypts with the corresponding private
key. Well, AB is then equivalent to the identity function. Of course, it would need to be more complex than this...

In a sense, DES or DES-like systems are just very abstract versions
that consider this concept. Each round is like a "different"
encryption system. Differential cryptanalysis (Biham and Shamir) shows
that if there are some correlations between the different rounds, then
the system can be cracked pretty quickly with a choosen plaintext
attack. 

When I read _The Codebreakers_ by David Kahn, it described the
attempts of the US Navy to decrypt the Japanese system employed during
WWII. In several cases I remember some quote like "Ensign Henson
stripped off the superencipherment quickly and began to work on the
bulk of the code." That meant that the Japanese were employing two
systems and the first encryption was relatively worthless.

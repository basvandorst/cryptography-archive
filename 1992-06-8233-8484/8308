Actually it is easy to compute a rough estimate, with some simplifying
assumptions.  

(I am writing with the information in my head, so please bear with me
if there are minor errors.)

Assume that English texts are a 1st order source.  According to different
estimates of the entropy of English texts, the per symbol entropy is
somewhere between 1 and 2 bit per symbol.  We shall assume it to be 2.

If the length of text is 6000 (8-bit) symbols, the total number of meaningful
messages of the length is approx. 2^(2*6000) = 2^12000.  The total number
of messages of length 6000 symbol is 2^(8*6000).

So about 1 out of every 2^36000 6000-symbol messages is a meaningful English
text.

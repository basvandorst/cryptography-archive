But only IF the compression algorithm is known to the attacker before the
attacker builds his massively parallel key search engine.  It's easy for
the attacker to change his mind, less easy for him to change thousands of
chips.

Or rather, that his massive key search machine expects to see and recognize.
Humans doing searches can be very adaptive in deciding what they're looking
for.  It's not clear that machines with hundreds or thousands of parallel
search engines can be this flexible.

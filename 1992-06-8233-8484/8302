Another issue in Steve's article is the chance of getting a second 
plausible but wrong plaintext by chance.  This is, of course, the 
Monkey Typing Shakespeare problem.

Given a message of 1000 words you get 6000 characters (@5 letters + 1 
space per word).  If the underlying character set is ~100 (i.e. 7bit 
ASCII less control characters), then the number of possible strings is
100**6000 = 10**12000.  Possible messages are a small subset of this space...
how small, I don't know.  Let's say for argument's sake only 1 string in 
10**20 is a possible message (Is there information on this point in 
the literature?).  Even then there is essentially no chance of a 
second message being produced 'accidentally' with only 2**56 keys (i.e., 
from memory, ~10**16 or so).  There are simply overwhelmingly many 
nonlinguistic strings.

I _am_ curious as to whether there is information on the ratio of 
linguistically correct strings to the universe of strings.  Any 
references out there?

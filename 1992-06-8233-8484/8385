                        Hi  All !!


      Information about newest model of Binary Images Coding Computer
System has been taken from confidential sources. Generated binary code
is invariant to turning, translation and scaling. The BICCS can be
used to analisys, comparing and storing finger prints (dactyloscopical
information). There is a BICCS brief characteristics (Made on
IBM PC/AT 286 16MHz):
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  (!!!!!!!!!!)


                       1. Size of generating code - 3.5 KB

                       2. Time of one image coding - 40 min.
                          Hardware support reduces it to 1 min.
                          and less.

                       3. Time of search in database of 1000 codes -
                          3 sec. (Can be reduced with hardware
                          support)

                       4. BICCS disk extent (now !) - 300 KB

       HURRY UP ! Cause with expansion BICCS will can to code

     half-tone images too and then it's fitness (and price) will

     increase impossibly, BICCS will need not for criminalists only.

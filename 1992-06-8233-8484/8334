...and in case it's not obvious to you, Alasdair:  any good candidate
for a message digest algorithm is by definition a good choice as the
one-way function for this purpose.  Several such algorithms are freely
available, including MD5 (Rivest's recommended message digest
algorithm) which you can ftp from rsa.com, file pub/md5.doc.

All you do is, have A and B each generate N random bits, exchange
message digests of those bits, then exchange the actual bits, check
the digests, and use the xor of them as the desired N random bits.

Remember to make N big enough (say, N>=64) so that a cheater can't
succeed at a brute force search over the 2^N possible random sequences,
looking for one that matches the digest given to him.

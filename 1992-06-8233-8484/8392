The generator is less simple than you presume. Its of cource jitter
based but not in a trivial way.

I know this (well not the % etc but the problem of
the randomness distribution of raw measurements not being
usefull at once). The program corrects this problem.

Partially true. There has been a large amount of testing of multiple
people however. I chalenge you to try it. I would be very interested
in the results!

My source has to do with hardware, not with software (althought the software
is needed to translate the hardware info in a usefull form).

And what about newspapers, magazines and television shows :-)

	Applying for a patent and getting it granted are two very different
	things.  You can screw around interminably once you have the first
	application, however rotten, in.  This seems to be a common ploy in
	some fields.  The important point seems to be to apply to get patent
	priority.   Somebody posted the granting date a few months back; it
	was in 1983.  So you have to wait until 2000 for the patent to run out.

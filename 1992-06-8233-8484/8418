See Knuth v.2, 2nd edition, section 3.3.4 "The Spectral Test".
Figure 8 has a nice picture of this.

In general, Knuth v.2 is the classic work on random numbers.
It's 11 years old now, and there's been quite a bit of newer work,
but Knuth is still an essential foundation.  If you're the least
bit [sic] interested in random number generation you should read
this chapter "cover to cover".  (Even if you want to generate random
bits in hardware, since much of the discussion covers methods of
*testing* random numbers.)

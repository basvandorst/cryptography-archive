I'm a computer engineering student with a lot of 74S, LS, and straight 7400
chips lying arround (> 1000) and I would like to make a DES implementation
with them.  I need a few references on how the DES algo. works.  I have a
few papers on it, but they use phrases such as, "take the output of the
E-box and permute it with the S-box..."  For someone who doesn't know what
an S-box is, the above statement is meaningless.  Can someone refer me to
some introductory information of the DES algo?  Thanks.

Do you know who that was?  I'd be curious to track down the story.
AT&T Microelectronics made -- and perhaps still makes; I'm not sure --
a random number generator chip.  It had two oscillators, a fast one
and a slow one; the slow one had to run at least 4000 slower than the
fast one.  It sampled the value of the fast oscillator at times selected
by the slow oscillator, and relied on phase jitter to get good random
values.

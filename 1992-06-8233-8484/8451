 A bit quick on the draw there, aren't we?

 Although I appreciate the introduction to birthday testing,
 your comment on my comment is simply wrong.

 Most computer language RNG's are small (32 bits total state)
 Linear Congruential Generators or Multiplicative generators
 designed to traverse their entire 32-bit state-space.  If you
 use one of these generators, and use the entire seed value
 from it, or use a real number translated in such a way as to
 maintain the full 32-bit range, then you will indeed see the
 RNG simply traverse 2**32 - 1 or 2**32 states without
 repetition.  There will be no collisions.

 Is this random?  No, but it is a good distribution.  It is
 also the way that the simple statistical RNG's work.

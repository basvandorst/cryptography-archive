    Crude approach:  One person randomly generates N, then sends an
encryption of N, 2N, ... kN concatenated for some large k.  The other person 
generates M, after which first person reveals key.  (this assumes
that only one N could come from some key.) then use N+M

   A fancier approach with provable security properties (relative to
quadratic residue assumption) was in the paper Probablistic Encryption
and Mental Poker by Goldwasser & Micali in a FOCS or STOC volume around
1982.

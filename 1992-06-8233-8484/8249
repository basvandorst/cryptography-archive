Actually most gambling machines (including the ones with mechanical wheels)
use a software random number generator. After you cut and restore the mains
power (pull the plug), the stepper motors that drive the wheels recalibrate
(evidently searching for some kind of index mark) and then the wheels re-
assume their previous position. This implies that wear of the mechanism has
no effect on the probabilistic behaviour of the machine. The wheels are
only there because it makes the machine look more attractive.

I do assume that the probability of a certain combination to appear does
correspond to the number of times each symbol is printed on the wheels.
(That is, the machine plays fair.)

I would bet that the random number generator is re-seeded with the times
of the key-on and key-off events of every button that is pressed, the time
at which a coin is inserted, etc. Even the (by now historic and famous)
Apple ][ computer had such a random number generator in the keyboard
input routine, but it was only used by the integer Basic interpreter, not
in the more powerful floating point one.

In the Netherlands, gambling machines must be tested for compliance with
some legal requirements. I have once spoken with a person working in the
organisation responsible for carrying out these tests. They are also
responsible for maintaining standards (ijkwezen). They were unimpressed
by the quality of the random number generators used in the machines.

The same organisation regularly tests the machine that is used to draw
winning numbers in a state lottery here. That machine has a remarkably
good random number generator. (It was designed at this university.)

Very unlikely.

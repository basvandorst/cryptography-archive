	I understand that there was some discussion here within the last
	couple of months about the "encryption" used by VCR+.  Can any readers
	point me to an archive of it, or send a copy?	

Sorry, can't help you here.

	Does anyone know the protection status of the VCR encoding?  Is it
	protected as a trade secret?  Is there a patent (I presume not, but I
	don't know) ?

Interestingly enough, there IS a patent.  (If you think about it, a patent is
the only kind of protection that would make much sense:  While the method
used is certainly not obviously, it can't be THAT complicated, as the $40 VCR+
units have no trouble computing the time/channel from the code.  Just how much
in the way of "computes" could they afford to put in there?  A trade secret
couldn't outlast more than a fairly short attack just based on the published
numbers in the newspaper - and if that fails, how hard could it be to take one
of the units apart?)

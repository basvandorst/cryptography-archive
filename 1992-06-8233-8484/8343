I found the following in Andrew Hodges' "Alan Turing: the enigma":


"Another item that [Turing] demanded from the engineers as a hardware
function of the Mark I Ferranti machine was what they called a
'sideways adder'. It would count the number of '1' bits in a 40-bit
sequence. This would have no application in a numerical program, but
would be very useful in one where the digits coded 'yes' or 'no'
answers to some Boolean question, and it was required to count the
'yes' answers - just what the Colossus had done. Such applications
might possibly have been spare-time interests of his own. However,
it was during this period, as the international situation hardened,
that he found himself consulted by GCHQ."


This was in 1949 or 1950.

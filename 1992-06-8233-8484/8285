Okay after openning my mouth this weekend when the libraries were
closed, I went to the libary and checked up on things. Here are some
relevent facts:

1) In 1977 Diffie and Hellman present a detailed design of how to
build a multi-chip DES cracking machine. The core of their design is a
chip which does not have the i/o channels necessary for a standard
implementation.  I.e. it only has a register, some logic and a simple
multi-plexed way to get info on and off. They estimate that it could
be built in 1977 for $20 million. ( I.E.E.E Computer, June 77, 10(6))

2) In 1979, Hellman and Tuchman and Davida and some other go at each
other in a round table in IEEE Spectrum. (July 1979). Hellman says
such a machine could be built and then they get in a big argument over
whether multiple encryption is better/worse than doubling the key
size. We now know that IBM was aware of the differential cryptanalysis
(re)-discovered by Biham and Shamir. (According to Coppersmith). This
work shows that increasing the bits in the key has relatively little
effect on the security of DES vis-a-vis this type of attack. The most
importanta defense was the design of the s-boxes and the number of
rounds of encryption.

3) Denning's book notes a report issued by Diffie in 1981 and says
that he had increased his estimates to $50 million and 2 days to break
a key using 1980's technology. The footnote only says that it was a
report issued by BNR Inc of Mountain View.

4) Garon and Outerbridge write in 1990 that they estimate that a one
day long exhaustive attack would cost $100 million. They do not go
into any of the details of designing the chip, but they estimate that
it should be possible to construct one that can check 4 million keys
per second and cost $25. (Cryptologia, July 1991).

Okay, so who is to be believed? Since none of us are really fabbing
these things and the people who may be doing so aren't talking, I
suggest that it is really an academic exercise. Heat, reliability,
power and shielding for massively parallel machines are still very
difficult problems that are only being explored now by the private sector.
 Diffie and Hellman's estimates are more convincing now that I re-read
them, but I still think that such a machine would require a really
sustained effort that only the big nations of the world could afford.


Should DES be replaced? Sure. Should there be a knowledgable group of
people doing it? Certainly. I believe that some branches of the
government would like it if DES remained around for a long time, but I
don't believe that this is really in our country's best interests.
Commerace is the cold war of today and we cannot afford to allow the
private sector to go unprotected.

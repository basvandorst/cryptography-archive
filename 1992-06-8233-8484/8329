My system, which I think I mentioned here a few months ago, is more
secure:

	1. Instead of iterating _n_ times, the number is added to the
	   seed to generate all the die rolls for a turn (you have to
	   pick the order in which they will be used).

	2. The numbers chosen by players need not be small, since the time
	   taken to generate numbers is no longer proportional to it.

	3. Player X picks the numbers to be added to Y's seed, and Y picks
	   numbers to be added to X's seed.  To get predictable results you
	   have to be able to predict the other player's numbers (if you're
	   that good, why not just predict his strategy instead?), or have
	   a lot of compute power available


My method is intended for people who don't think it is worth hours of
cray time just to win a game, but with a random number generator using
DES or some other method you could probably prevent cray-based attacks
as well.

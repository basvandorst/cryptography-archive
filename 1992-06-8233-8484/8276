I noticed this in some DES documentation:

2 to the 48th power is about 2.8E+14, and 2 to the 56th power is 7E+16.

At a test rate of one key per microsecond, then each chip could test
8.6E+10 keys per day, and 3258 chips would be sufficient to check all
2.8E+14 keys in a day. With 9 chips, the key could be found within a
year.

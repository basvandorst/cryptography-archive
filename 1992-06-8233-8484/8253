I suggest you look at the chapter on DES in Davies and Price's book
``Security for Computer Networks''.  It explains all this in some detail.
But the keysearch machine -- yes, it is brute force, using many processors.
See the Diffie and Hellman paper ``Exhaustive Cryptanalysis of the NBS
Data Encryption Standard'', Computer 10,6,74 (June 1977).  The NBS held
a workshop to consider the question; it concluded that the machine was
much more expensive than Diffie and Hellman said, and that it couldn't
be built until 1990...  You might also want to look at Hellman's paper
``DES will be totally insecure within ten years'', IEEE Spectrum 16,7,32
(July 1979).

If DES is not a group, then multiple encryptions comprise a
different cipher entirely, one for which special-purpose hardware
may not exist.  This scheme is generally suggested for shipping
other keys around, a situation in which means of cryptanalysis other
than brute force are likely to be useless.  (There's too little
cipher text with which to work.)

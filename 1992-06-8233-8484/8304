Plausible as plaintext, or plausible as what you're expecting to find?

Remember, in the space of information that is sensible plaintext, some of the
possible messages in fact actually are Shakespeare, and most of them are not
anything like what you're expecting to find.

Thus, even in the space of linguistic strings, there is only a small
subset which could resemble what you're after.

But if you do get Shakespeare as a second plaintext by some chance, you've got
something to tell your grandchildren about.

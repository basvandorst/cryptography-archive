Question for anybody on the net who knows when the patents for RSA were issued:

Does anyone know when the RSA public-key algorithm patents expire?

The RSA public key algorithm was, I believe,  first published around 1976.
Patent law, as far as I recall, requires you to apply for the patent
within 1 year of publishing your invention, and gives you 17 years
of exclusive rights to it. Therefore, I would be expecting the RSA
patents to expire around 1993-1994, thus putting the algorithm into
the public domain.

Cyberspace, in its present condition, has a lot in common with the 19th
Century West. It is vast, unmapped, culturally and legally ambiguous,
verbally terse (unless you happen to be a court stenographer), hard to get
around in, and up for grabs. Large institutions already claim to own the
place, but most of the actual natives are solitary and independent,
sometimes to the point of sociopathy. It is, of course, a perfect breeding
ground for both outlaws and new ideas about liberty.

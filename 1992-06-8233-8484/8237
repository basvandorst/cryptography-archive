Looking in the Intel Peripherals data book on my desk... ...I see
they have an 8294 which might be what you are looking for.  The
main snag is, you're in Finland.  Like us here in the UK, you might
have difficulty in obtaining the part since you aren't in the U.S.

The 8294 is a mask programmed UPI-42.  You _could_ do your own DES
implementation in one.  However, from personal experience

	a)	If you are going to program your
		own microcontroller to do something 
		like DES, don't bother with a UPI-42.
		It's about the same price as an MCS-51
		part and _much_ more brain-damaged.

	b)	A microcontroller implementation
		may be just _too_ slow for your
		application, anyway ;-).

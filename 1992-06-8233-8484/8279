We rest comfortably because only the NSA (or CIA?) (or equivalent outside
the US) could afford to build such a machine -- and since DES is used only
for non-classified data (eg., bank transactions) these agencies have no
reason to bother breaking into such traffic.

It's a good thing that these agencies never need to fear a reduction in
funding -- never get tempted to do something like divert arms sale
profits.....

> [ re graphical testing of RNGs ]

Seems to me I remember an article (possibly one of the newsy articles
in _Science_) showing what happened when a supposedly good random
number generator was used to plot points in three dimensions.
From many viewing angles the points looked randomly distributed,
but from one particular angle it was easy to see that all the points
actually lay on parallel lines with a regular spacing.  This was
published several years ago.

Phil Karn, wuzzat you quoted in the NY Times about the ease of 
eavesdropping on cellular phones at the Democratic convention?
(Not that the Repubs would ever stoop so low.  Heck, the only
worse thing might be stealing debate briefing books :-)

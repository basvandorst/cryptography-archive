I hope that the following information answers your questions:

1.  *TRUE* One-time pads require *TRUE* random bits, not pseudo-random bits.
2.  SOFTWARE can NOT generate *TRUE* random bits.
3.  I designed and developed in Cryptosystems Journal a hardware random
    number generator based on 16 crystal oscillators (typically each
    oscillating at 20 MHz - 30 Mhz (for an aggregate frequency of 320 Mhz -
    480 MHz).  Specifically, I published Printed Circuit Board (PCB) artwork.
    The parts cost less than $40 (if you know where to get parts cheap and
    etch the board and build it yourself).  Most importantly, I tested over
    2 Billion bits using 18 statistical tests from Knuth.  The empirical
    results are almost exactly as expected.
4.  Volume 3 will include a one-time-pad which gets random bits from this
    hardware random number generator.
5.  The RANGER Device outputs random bits on the order of 5,000 random bits
    per second.  Speed was a design parameter because my Galois Field-based
    encryption software can create random crypto-keys containing 40,000,000
    or more random bits (using for example 11 MegaBytes of extended memory
    in a PC).

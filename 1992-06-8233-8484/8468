I'd like to add my vote to the side that points out that Nico has done
something that appears to be amazingly useful. Whether it is, or not,
can be (and should be) the subject of testing.  There are a number
of people out there who appear to be ready to decree it to be
*not* useful, by making statements like that above.

I see no reason to assume that statements like that above have any
"true" usefulness to this group.

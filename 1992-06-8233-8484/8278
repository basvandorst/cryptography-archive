The only method I have thought of for providing truly anonymous 2-way
postings is with public keys (eg., RSA).  Each participant could have his
own public key.  There would be a number of machines in the role of wizvax
-- with two or more selected at random by the posting originator: call them
w1 and w2.


1.  I compose a posting -- include my public key in it but not my name.

2.  I encrypt it with w2's key and prefix that encrypted block with a note
	to forward this to w2.

3.  I encrypt that package with w1's key and send the result to w1.

4.  w1 waits a random length of time (different for each message) before
	releasing my decrypted package to the mailer.  Once there, another
	random period is waited, gathering a batch of messages to mail
	or post.

5.  w2 receives my mail, decrypts it and waits a random length of time
	before posting it.

6.  people wishing to reply do so by posting the reply (through their own
	indirection mechanism).  These replies might be in the clear when
	posted or might be encrypted in my personal key.  They might give
	e-mail addresses for me to write to or might not.

================

The drawback is that there's a lot of net traffic here, just to preserve
privacy -- and I'm not sure how private this ends up.  I know how to
analyze an encryption algorithm for security.  What I'm trying to do here
is "encrypt" the delivery process so that traffic analysis is thwarted.

Does anyone know how to analyze this process?  Is there a reasonable
extension to Shannon's work, for example, for when the traffic is the
message?

Sorry if this posting reflects my ignorance, but live and learn...  ;)

While a specialized chip could be made that would quickly decrypt a 
particular string with a key, it seems to me that the difficult and
time-consuming task would be to detect whether or not the results made
sense.  In decrypting a string with the improper password, is it not 
possible that the result would have "plaintext" in it by random result?
The algorithm to sort out "sensical" decrypted messages would have to
check a fair proportion of the text to figure this out, no?  While the
time to do this is not great, proportional to the decryption time and
in massive quantities I suspect it will greatly add to the crack time.

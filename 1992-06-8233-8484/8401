>>Nearly _any_ textbook on cryptography would answer these questions.

>>How sad that so many university students now prefer to post questions
is it really so sad that someone would ask someone else who might
actually have some useful experience with this subject what they think
a good reference might be? I don't know about your online library search
but ours doesn't actually include a short summary to see if the book
will actually be useful. In this case the list of books could be quite
long;not all of them will be available, and getting all of the ones that
are could take some time considering many places maitain departmental 
libraries.  Sorry but I can't recommend any good books though; I did
like _Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintainence_ but it doesn't have
anything on DES though  ;'>

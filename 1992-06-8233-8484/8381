Correct. On e.g. a IBM-PC (or compatible) enough hardware is present
to generate them anyway. Email me for sources.

Why 16 crystals? 2 crystals should be enough. An IBM-PC has 2 and those
are the ones I use in my source.

Impressive, I have to admit my routine is less fast. It generates only
about 128 random bits per second. But than again it is free and simple.

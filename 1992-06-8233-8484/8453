   Now you're getting to some good points.  A serious problem with using
   the Unix password algorithm isn't whether it's good enough, but whether
   it's available on enough systems.   I've been led to believe that it's
   not public domain - is that true?  Is there no easy way to make it
   available on other platforms?  For exampile, I have my own version (a
   rewrite of crypt() for speed.)  Could I distribute it since it doesn't
   contain any actual code from the original crypt()?

But it isn't good enough, and MD5 is in the public domain. Hell, I
hope to see MD5 used on new unix systems as a drop in for crypt(3); it
would fix a lot of the current problems of limited password length and
crackability.

   Where can I get info on MD5?  Is it, as you say, public domain?  Would
   there be any problem in including MD5 code in news software that would
   be sent all over the world? 

Poke around on rsa.com; anonymous ftp to there should yield up MD5
sources and specifications.

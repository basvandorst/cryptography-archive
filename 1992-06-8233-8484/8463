As far as I know, the only precise documentation for the password algorithm
is its source... which is licensed software, under licensing terms that
explicitly forbid publishing documentation on its innards without permission.
It is approximately DES, but there is enough undocumented detail to make
duplication non-trivial.  I'm not aware of a redistributable clone.  It is,
in any case, an obsolete method, if only because it is too fast.

Internet RFC 1321 contains, I believe, a complete description.  It has
been explicitly placed in the public domain.

That is a separate question.  DES has been public domain for a long time,
and that hasn't stopped bureaucrats from classifying DES-based software
as a type of munition, subject to massive export complications.  I don't
know the current situation in the US, but it's safe to assume that many
of the paper-pushers still haven't figured out that the Cold War is over.

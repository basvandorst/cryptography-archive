   Hopefully not.  Unless you are the (only) system administrator, and
   you only read PGP messages on the console, you are vulnerable to
   root snooping and/or wiretapping.  Many users go through terminal
   servers to get to Unix machines -- Ethernet is about as unsecure a
   medium as you can get!

None of this is a good reason for there not to be a PGP for Unix. Many
people use Unix and doubtless would like to use PGP on it, especially
lacking anything else. People concerned with the issues you raise will
simply run PGP on their own machines if they choose; there is no reason
to deprive the community of software.

There ARE ports of PGP for Unix, but being in the USA, I am not sure
I'm in a position to legally distribute, or even possess, one.

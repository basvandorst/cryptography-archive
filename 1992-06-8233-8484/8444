I accept the claim but disagree with it. I DO think the non constant
nature of the crystals in the PC is measurable and believe my algo
measures it. You claim the non deterministic part of the process is
to small to measure. I don't really see why. Using two crystals to
measure differences can be very accurate and I don't see why that
would not be the case here.

I did many (as said before) and others are doing the same. I will
as promised post the results. Unfortunately it is much easier to
show problems than showing they don't exist. 

Till now no practical test has shown problems. The theoretic part
is much harder. I am afraid some physical experiments might be
needed to check how measurable the non-deterministic properties
of the PC-Crystals are and if my algo measures them or something
else.

Very true. Stupid remark of me.

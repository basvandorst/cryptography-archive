Try "prog pgp" or "prog pem" at your nearest archie-site for a list of
FTP sites containing such programs. PGP10SRC.{zip, arj, Z, etc}
contains sources. If you don't know any archie site at your continent,
ftp to archie.funet.fi, login archie.

The US is one of the few countries which allows patents on algorithms.

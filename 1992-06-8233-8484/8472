Summary: Wierd though it sounds, IBM is working on it
Keywords: quantum key
Lines: 9

      Scientific American (July 1992, page 100) notes briefly that 
Charles Bennett at IBM's Watson Research Center has built a device for
transmitting a random number safely using the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen
effect.  This is a concept so wierd that I won't even try to describe it.
I suggest reading the article.  But it suggests that the untappable
distribution of keys, protected by the "observer effect" in quantum
mechanics, may be possible.

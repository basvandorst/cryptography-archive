Agreed very much!

Correct. But the "machine" being deterministic (meaning the uP
and its flow of conrol etc) does not mean all hardware in
a specific computer is deterministic as well. 

Computers HAVE to be deterministic. It is one of their major
strengths. From the view of a 100% software algo everything
(should be) is deterministic.

Well I think it is less spectacular than that. I wouldn't
call using the non-deterministic phase shift of crystal
olscilators a major breaktrough. 

If some pascal program (no HW allowed) would act non-deterministic
THAN there would be a breakthrough. But it can be proven this
is impossible. (especialy Dijkstra will elaborate this :-)

Yes indeed. I realy love usenet for this possibility!

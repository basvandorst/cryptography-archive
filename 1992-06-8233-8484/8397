For those more objective than Nelson, I did a lit search first.  All of
the books claiming to have a description of DES have been checked out
be a grad student.  That means that they will be returned to the library
some time after 5/18/93.  I sort of wanted to start before then.  I am
going to *buy* the books that have been recommended to me.  That alone
is reason enough to ask people on this, supposedly learned, group what
their *personal* favorites are.  Maybe next time Nelson will give me 
the benefit of the doubt.

Maybe not.

I have seen the insides of a VCR+.  It consists of a clock circut (equivalent
to a cheap LCD watch, crystal controled), the same stuff as a regular infrared
remote control, a single chip computer (I don't remember which one but I think
was an 8 bitter with .5k ROM and 256 byte RAM internal to the chip) and about 4K
in ROM chips.  I would guess that all the programming is in the internal
ROM and the external ROM just store the info about the differnet remote control
codes it knows about.

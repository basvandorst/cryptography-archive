      That's a mild understatement! It appears from this (and
some earlier postings) that quite a few people believe that
CRC has some cryptographic value. An article in Dr. Dobb's
Journal (May 1992) suggests that it could be used to detect a
virus infested file (giving a warning that `an exceptionally
clever' virus might be able to fool CRC). CRC was not designed
for that and should *not* be used for that. Specifically, it is
_easy_ to:
 - Find two different files with the same CRC;
 - Construct a file with an arbitrary CRC (given in advance).
      These two are (allegedly) computationally infeasible when
MD5 or the proposed SHA are used. CRC is a great tool to detect
accidental changes to files, but to use it in cryptography is
downright dangerous.

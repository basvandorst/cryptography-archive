It is true that a one-time pad achieves perfect secrecy; it is _not_
true that just because the opponent doesn't know the source or
exact composition of an imperfect one-time pad that it is secure:
for example, in the novel "The Key for Rebecca" the pad is taken from
sequential text from a book.  This will almost trivially be broken.

Any detectable regularities in the key stream are _bad_ and will almost
certainly lead to your messages being broken, given enough encrypted
texts to differentially analyze.  Also, reusing any length of the one-time
pad will permit your system to be broken.  Refer to Friedman's
"Index of Coincidence" that he developed back in the 20's to break
certain polyalphabetic ciphers that were really just imperfect
one-time pads.

As far as PC generators of one-time pads: just because you cannot find
any statistical regularities in an arbitrary sequence of bits, does _not_
mean that they are not there and exploitable by an astute opponent.
True chaos (whatever that is) is pretty hard to find and exploit...

[Since the original discussion had a distribution of "North America",
 I'll phrase my comments in the context of the US.  However, the basic
 issues involved apply in almost any country, so I have changed the
 distribution to unlimited.]

Unfortunately,
(1)	A student may not have a social security number, for example
	a non-US citizen who isn't enrolled in US social security.
(2)	A student may not *yet* have an SSN, and be using a "temporary
	SSN" assigned by the university in the interem until the govt
	assigns a permanent one.

Also, what about
(3)	A student may (legally) change her/his name.
(4)	How does your hash function handle non-ASCII characters in a
	name?  The mapping "(Chinese characters) --> ASCII" has changed
	over the years (what was once "Peking" is now "Bejing").  There
	are also ambiguities in Cryllic-character names, eg "Chebyshev"
	vs "Tchebychev".  Even the western European languages have
	major ASCII-izing ambiguities, exemplified by 15 or so accents
	and several ligatures (including some which sort differently
	from their ASCII-izations, such as the German "es-zet" $\ss$).
(5)	The division of a name into "last", "first", and "middle" parts
	isn't unique, and is done differently in different cultures and
	at different times.  What happens if a student initially puts
	down her/his "home" division, than later (possibly some years
	later) switches to the "US" division?  What happens if a data
	entry clerk initially puts down the "US" division, but the
	student consistently uses her/his "home" division?

All these problems are soluble, but they have to be considered before
and during the initial system design.  Tagging people with unique
immutable "keys" is *hard*.  

Using US social security numbers, also has significant confidentiality
and privacy implications, which need carefull consideration.

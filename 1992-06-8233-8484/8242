In LNCS 473 (Advances in Cryptology - EUROCRYPT '90) Xuejia Lai and 
James L Massey propose an algorithm for a new block encryption standard. 
I'd like to know what the current status of the cipher is; has it been
broken or has there been some changes in the proposed algorithm?

Answers to these questions or pointers to references would be greatly 
appreciated, please respond via email to: magnusp@groucho.csd.uu.se

Thanks in advance.

It's actually two problems; one for the case where you don't mind
eavesdropper C from determining A&B's random number, e.g. for games,
and the other for the case where you *don't* want C to know,
e.g. for session key exchange.  The common solution to the latter is
{Diffie|Merkle}&Hellman's key exchange method:
	given p and m with appropriate relative-primeness,
	A sends (p**a) mod m to B,
	B sends (p**b) mod m to A,
	A and B compute p**(a*b) mod m
		= ( p**a mod m)**b mod m 
		= ( p**b mod m)**a mod m
	and use it for the key; 
You can use other functions instead of exponentiation as long as 
they have the appropriate commutativity to let A and B get the same number,
and lots of people have written papers about ways to use it.

Somebody Else writes that you need to prevent B from echoing back A's
one-way-checksum and random number which would give A xor B = 0.

You also have to look at the tradeoffs between security level and the
number of bits you're trying to pass; MD-5 is very secure, but it also
uses a lot more bits of data than you're likely to want for
initializing a game program :-)  Other One-ways may use less data and
take less time to compute, though they're correspondingly more forgeable.

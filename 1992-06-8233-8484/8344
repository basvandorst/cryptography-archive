Actually, 40 bits wouldn't be too bad if encoded properly.  Instead of
using hexadecimal, you could use {0-9,A-F,H,J,K,M,N,P-Z}.  I left out
{G,I,L,O} because their written forms can be confused with numerals.
Those 32 characters are good for 5 bits each, so a 40-bit identifier
would only be 8 characters long...  That's not *too* bad.

The *REAL* problem in this identifier business is finding enough
*non-changing*, *readily available* information about a person to
uniquely identify them.  As pointed out, not everyone *has* a numeric
identifier which they'll remember.  Not everyone can pinpoint the date
on which they were born either!  Names change.  And what if they're
UNCONSCIOUS???

Are there any physical dimensions on the human anatomy which are
reasonably measurable and stable over time?  I realize that this would
only work for adults, but hey... that's better than *nothing*.

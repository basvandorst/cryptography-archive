My preferred method is to use an assumed 1-way function (eg., MD5) on the
password string and save the hash of all passwords I use (about a dozen of
them) in a file readable only by me.  If the password I type is in the
list, then it's not a typo.  I might have chosen the wrong password, but
there are few enough that I can try all of them.

This provides a wedge for crackers, if they can get to that file, but if my
passwords are long enough (and I tend to use typed strings of more than 16
characters -- up to full lines), the brute force method won't work.

At least this way, there's no check value in the message itself.  Any
cracker has to break the security of my file system first and only then do
massive dictionary attacks against my set of password hashes.

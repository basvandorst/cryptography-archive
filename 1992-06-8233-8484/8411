I haven't been archiving sci.crypt, so I lost some information.  I
remember a long thread about cracking PKZIP files that have been
encrypted, and a brute force algorithm to do it.

I have some files sitting around and I forgot the password, so could
somebody email me anything helpful?  Sorry to resurrect a dead issue.

Regards,
Dude

Actually, I make no claim to know what YOU'RE talking about, either.
I do claim that silver is a really cool color, if it's a color at all!

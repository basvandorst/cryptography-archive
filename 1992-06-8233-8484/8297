2 or 3 years there were some lists on the black market in germany.
These lists contained the (circular) sequence of the appearing combinations
of a special widespread (in germany) gambling machine. I think someone had
read the ROM or so.

I heard, they must only look at 3 or 4 consecutive results of the machine
and they can determine, where in the sequence the machine is.
Now it is possible to decide, whether it is worth to continue gambling or not,
because you can exact determine the results of the next games.
And sure, you can determine the exact point to stop gambling!

At that time, only machines with a strict sequence are allowed to assure
a guaranteed payout. But this caused the possibility of the attack.

I don't know exactly, but I heard some rumours about changed rules
for the programs with more 'random' sequences to avoid such attacks.

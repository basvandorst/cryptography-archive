The context here is that we have a source of "semirandom" bits,
and we'd like to some how get some "really random" bits from them.
I and a couple of others have suggested using the "semirandom" bits
as inputs to a good modern cryptosystem like MD5 or DES, and taking
the output as our hopefully "really random" bits.

I disagree with 2.  Assuming that the original semirandom bits
have a structure that could be crytographically analyzed, then
we want to scramble that structure enough so that analyzing
the output of our "improver" will be too hard for our cryptographic
opponent.  CRC does a lot less scrambling than a good hashing
or cipher algorithm like MD5 or DES respectively.

I also disagree with part of 3.  I'm not sure about MD5, but
I'd certainly agree that we don't know how DES was designed,
and that the NSA (*) presumably do know.  Therefore I would consider
DES to be inadequate for the present purpose if I were trying to get
random bits which the NSA couldn't cryptographically "unrandomize".
(I.e., given the past 10**12 bits from my "random" stream, and
any other "anciliary" information about my computer they might
happen to have handy, can they say anything useful about the next
N bits, for any useful value of N).

But, if you're worrying about the NSA unrandomizing your bits,
they you can probably afford a *real* radioactive or thermal-noise
or whatever random number generator.  (Even the NSA can't fudge
the 2nd law of thermodynamics!)  Therefore, I think it's reasonable
to say that this whole thread is aimed at a lower degree of security.

And I would argue that for any degree of security where your
cryptographic opponents are smaller than (say) a rather large corporation,
that DES is a *superb* cipher, and that MD5 is probably a *superb*
cryptographic hashing function.  I'm quite willing to grant weaknesses
in either which the NSA could climb through, but that's not what
we're talking about here.  These systems have both been around
long enough to have been attacked by a lot of pretty good people.
The fact that (so far as I know) they're as yet unbroken (modulo
differential cryptoanalysis for DES, which isn't yet "practical")
suggests that they're strong systems.

For DES we also have additional evidence that it's strong -- banks
are using it for *large* wire transfers, in the $100Ms and up.  If
DES weren't secure against any but the NSA, I'm sure the NSA would
have quietly lobbied the American Banker's Association not to adopt
it as a standard for this type of use.

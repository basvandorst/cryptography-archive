In sci.crypt, I asked:
>Where can I get info on MD5?

I found it on rsa.com in pub.  Thanks Archie.

But I'm was still wondering:
>Would there be any problem in including MD5 code in news software that

I guess if rsa.com can put it on an anonymous ftp server without problems
then I could do the same with news software that include an MD5
implementaion.  But I thought the US Gov had problems with passing
any type of crypto software or hardware out of the country?  Have they
said that doing this with MD5 is ok?  How does this all work (or not
work)?

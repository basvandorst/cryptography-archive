Every once in a while I hear that the French do not permit encrypted data
to cross French borders if the source or destination is within France.
(encrypted data can therefore transit across France). Another rumor was
that some contries required you to register with the PTT and yet other
required your key. I'd appreciate anyone verifying or shooting down these
rumors.

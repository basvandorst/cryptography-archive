   See Knuth v.2, 2nd edition, section 3.3.4 "The Spectral Test".
   Figure 8 has a nice picture of this.

   In general, Knuth v.2 is the classic work on random numbers.
   It's 11 years old now, and there's been quite a bit of newer work,
   but Knuth is still an essential foundation.  If you're the least
   bit [sic] interested in random number generation you should read
   this chapter "cover to cover".  (Even if you want to generate random
   bits in hardware, since much of the discussion covers methods of
   *testing* random numbers.)


Yes Knuth is getting a little dusty -- but still good. Now, we
understand how this method of embedding in a high dimension space
works better. Some really nice math based on work initially done by
the "chaos cabal" at Irvine and then formally developed by Grassburger
shows that one can recover the phase space attractor (up to a
homeomorphism) of a periodic dynamical system (read PRNG) by using
time delayed coordinates. There is a way to estimate how many delayed
coordinates are needed to do this (called the embedding dimension). In
a sense a true RNG would be embedded in a infinite dimensional space.
Of course, empirical testing becomes hard for say 10 dimensions because
of the difficulty in generating an adequate data set (the curse of
dimensionality).


Looking at Com Sci from a dynamical perspective,

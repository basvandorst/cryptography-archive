How do you know this?  What's the patent number?  What does it patent?

As someone else pointed out, the VCR Plus+ device only says patent pending  
- which has no real meaning.

Yes, (in response to another posting) if they patent the algorithm, you  
could go look it up.  But it's very unlikely that Gemstar would try to  
patent the algorithm - because there's nothing really unique about it. And  
if the patent was awarded then their algorithm would be known to the  
public - but if someone stole it, and Gemstar lost the court case trying  
to defend it, then they would loose the rights to the algorithm.

No, I think they are trying to protect it just as a trade secrete.

And I think the patent they applied for probably just covers the concept  
of a device using code numbers to program a TV, and not the actual  
algorithm they use.  But this is just my guess.  If anyone has seen a  
patent for the VCR Plus+, or knows for sure that this is one, I'd like to  
know about it.

This topic has been discussed multiple times over the past year or so and  
I haven't heard of anyone that has actually tried to look for the patent.  
(I even live in the D.C. area and haven't even bothered going down to the  
patent office to look for it.).

Subject: How to read ATM authorizations?

At a computer fair this past weekend, I picked up a (what seems to be an
older model) credit card authorization unit.  It is a "TALTEK 727" and
has a built-in 300 baud modem along with a connection for a 1200 baud
printer.

In principle, you swipe the credit card, enter the amount, and hit
"SALE".  It then dials a phone number (stored in NVRAM) and then
communicates.  All I've been able to figure out is that it waits for a
^E (ENQ, I think) and then sends data in the form:
    ^B data ^C checksum-char

I'd like to find some specifications for this data so I could use it for
something locally (mostly some sort of access checking with existing ID
cards, if possible).

Does anyone know where I can find this stuff out?

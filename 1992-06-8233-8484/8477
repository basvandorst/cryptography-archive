I've had the experience of designing mu and A law DAC's. The idle channel
noise of the device is the mechanism which is proposed above to produce
random numbers. In designing real world devices, I have found that this
noise is not randomly generated but is caused by various types of
cross talk with other components in the system. The cardinal rule
in the design of such systems is not to pollute your DAC ground
with digital currents.

What I am really trying to say is that this noise is not random but
is characteristic of the specific circuit design being used.
One could gain statistical knowlege of the "real" random numbers
being generated by knowing the specific work sation design.
For example, one could know that there will be bursts of noise
synchronized to the frequency of the switching regulator
used in the system.

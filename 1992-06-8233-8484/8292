Right.  But machines still need to store decrypting keys somewhere.
And public key schemes are *much* too slow to use for anything but
key exchange and message signatures; they're not suited to data transfer.

Rember that Biham&Shamir's attack is *chosen* plaintext, i.e., you
have to trick the opponent into doing the 2^47 encryptions.  Or do you
think that they'll be obliging enough to provide you with 1K fast
encryption processors, all loaded with their keys.  Also note that
using any of the chaining modes is a very strong defense, since even if
you can force the encryption of long portions of messages, you don't
know what the actual block encrypted will be.  And no one in their right
mind uses ECB mode for long messages.

Very probably.

No.  There are still no publicly-known attacks better than exhaustive
search.  And if you used your own cryptosystem, what assurance do you have
that it would be any stronger?  Remember, you don't know how to build secure
cryptosystems.  There have been many DES-like cryptosystems proposed; those
are easier to crack via differential cryptanalysis, because the
inventors didn't know of that technique.  IBM knew it 18 years ago, and
designed DES to resist it.  (Btw, the FEAL ciphers make an interesting
case study.  Differential cryptanalysis works very well against FEAL --
but NTT is still using it, I believe, since they realize that using it
in CBC mode is a strong defense.)

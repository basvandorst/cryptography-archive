At Eurocrypt last week, there was a remark by a well known German expert that 
he wouldn't like the knowhow of the ZCO - the former East German cipher shop -
to get out into the public domain. In fact the Bonn government is keeping them
going in a company (SIT, or Systeme der Infotechnik GmbH of
Charlottenstrasse 7, 
0-1252 Gr\"unheide) at the German taxpayers' expense.

One of their boffins, Ralph Wernsdorf, delivered a paper `The One-round 
Functions of DES Generate the Alternating Group' in which he uses quite
sophisticated finite group theory to prove the theorem which is the paper's
title. This sort of analysis is apparently unique to the former East European
cipher shops - they had to use mathematicians rather than computers.

So I wouldn't be surprised if there is an accelerated `differential analysis'
of DES which reduces the search space a bit more than Biham and Shamir have
done.

I also wouldn't be surprised if there's some trick for undoing the proposed
Digital Signature Standard - by going from (r^x mod p) mod q, which is hard,
to r^x mod q, which is a tractable discrete log problem. This is the sort of
transformation that one might reasonably hope to get from group theory. 
Perhaps the DSS arises from an NSA debriefing of East European crypto
mathematicians. See also the stuff on comp.risks by Bidzos, Kaliski and 
others on this topic.

On the other hand, it is well known that Robotron, a former East German
computer company, delivered tens of thousands of DES chips to the Russian
army. These were supposed to be for hard disk controllers, but one must 
assume that the Russians built at least one keysearch machine as well.

SIT's government funding runs out next year and presumably we'll find out the
truth then. But then again maybe not.

One way or another, single-key DES is getting a bit long in the tooth, and
there are a lot of people in the UK finding phantom ATM withdrawals on their
statements, for which the banks deny all responsibility. I hope this is just
a coincidence,

Ross

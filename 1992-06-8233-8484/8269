This thread was discussing what would be involved in a brute force
keysearch attack on DES.  I described how Diffie and Hellman proposed
building a special-purpose machine using 1e6 chips, each checking 1e6
possible keys per second, to try all 2^56 = 7e16 possible keys in about
a day.  The NBS's responce to Diffie and Hellman questioned their
estimates ($20M cost in 1977) of the feasability of this.

Referring to those questions, in article

In general, I agree with all of this, but I have three comments:
1.	Diffie & Hellman didn't say "Take 1,000,000 chips and glue
	them together...".  Rather, their paper discussed the
	various "massive parallelism engineering" aspects in some
	detail, including all the
	problems mentioned above.  They gave what I consider good
	arguments that these were all soluable without undue
	difficulty.

	The analogy with the design of a present-day
	"Connection machine" is inappropriate, because the latter
	is meant to be a general purpose massivly parallel
	computer, with a software reconfigurable logical
	interconnection network.  I agree, doing *that*, and
	scaling it to a teraflop, is *very* hard.

	(Un)fortunately, D&H's
	proposed DES cracker machine doesn't need such generality
	-- it would be a special-purpose device with all its
	interconnections predetermined at hardware-design
	time.  The DES-cracking problem is essentially 100%
	parallelizable with almost no communication required
	between the individual processors, rather like ray-tracing.
	This greatly simplifies the hardware design needed.
	Notably, there's no need for any software reconfiguration
	of the interconnection network except to detect and swap
	out bad processors.  D&H discussed this and described
	reasonable methods for doing this, along with provisions
	for cooling, maintainence access, initialization, and
	various other "mundane" tasks.

2.	I think this analogy is inappropriate.  Noone has
	seriously proposed using 1 million PCs with 1 human
	per PC to break the DES -- indeed, they would be far
	too slow to do so in a reasonable amount of time.
	The D&H design uses a *combination* of high speed
	custom VLSI and massive parallelism to break the
	DES -- neither alone seems to be sufficient.
	(Though large numbers of humans using brute force
	techniques were an important part of the WW2 solution
	of rotor machines such as the German Enigma, cf
	Welchman, "The Hut Six Story".)

3.	Arguments that "it would require a massive amount of work"
	aren't persuasive here.  The NSA, KGB, TRB, GCHQ, and various
	other such agencies can, have in the past, and continue to
	spend massive amounts of money on breaking cryptosystems.
	(Often using, of course, not-publicly-known means far more 
	sophisticated than brute force keysearching.)
	Indeed, if DES is important in the protection of inter-bank
	wire transfers measured in the $100M+ range, I could see
	non-governmental criminal organiations becoming involved.

In the last several days, we've had a big discussion going on about
the size and cost of building a large DES exhaustive search machine.
I've recently written a technical report that shows how to use a
special version of Content Addressable Memory to encrypt and decrypt
DES or a DES-like substitute. You can either use the chips as part of
a standard computer or you can build a massively parallel machine to
attack it.

There are three major advantages to the approach:

1) The chips are stock hardware and will be available off-the-shelf.
This makes building a massive attack machine much easier. Also, the
chips can be used for many different purposes so including them in a
off-the-shelf computer is easier to justify.

2) Encryption rates are well in line with the specialized chips
available now as long as enough data is available. 30-100 megabits per
second are easily possible. (The system uses the memory locations of
the special content-addressable memory as tiny parallel processors. It
is one tiny SIMD machine.)

3) The algorithm exists in software so the system can easily be
reprogrammed to use different s-boxes, key-sequencing algorithms or
block structures. 

If you would like a copy of the technical report, drop me a line. If
you can accept PostScript files, then please tell me. It will save
time and postage if we can do this electronically. If you need a paper
copy, just send me an address.

Yours in code,

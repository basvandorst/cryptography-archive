Hopefully not.  Unless you are the (only) system administrator, and you only
read PGP messages on the console, you are vulnerable to root snooping and/or 
wiretapping.  Many users go through terminal servers to get to Unix
machines -- Ethernet is about as unsecure a medium as you can get!

BTW, I'd really appreciate it if somebody ported PGP to a Mac.

To contrapositize Bob Cain, use it only on a single user machine.  You can
buy an old PC for less than a new terminal.  Do it.

   With games it is sufficient to determine after the fact that no cheating is
   going on (You just don't play future games with cheats.) 

   First you agree on a common RNG and a algorithm to convert RGN
   results to die rolls.  Each player picks a seed for the RNG,
   embedds the seed value in a message like:

   The seed I chose of our game of krigspel is NNNNNNNNNNNN.

   encrypts the message and sends it to the other player.  On my move
   when I specify an attack I include a small integer value associated
   with that attack.  when the other player recieves my move, he
   generated the attack results by iterating the RNG the number of
   times associated with the attack and using that value to genreate
   the die roll. He then returns the result to me.  At the end of the
   game we exchange encryption keys, and now can by duplicating the
   other players RNG sequence verify that no one cheated.

All this does is verify that you used the "correct" RNG.  It doesn't
stop you from hunting for a seed value which, for the agreed-upon RNG,
generates a pattern which is biased in your favor in the "short term"
(e.g., the first few dozen rolls) which may be sufficient to establish
an early strategic advantage, and thus win the game.

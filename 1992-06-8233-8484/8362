Are there any products available that generate one-time pads, in
particular, arbitrarily long sequences of random bits that are the
result of some apparently random process like radioactive decay?  At
what rate can they pump out the bits?  How do they work?  How much do
they cost?

No jokes about audio DAC's connected to radios tuned to unused
parts of the spectrum please...  :->

Thanks in advance.  All info appreciated,

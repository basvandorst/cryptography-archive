Just a reminder:  The use of the Diffie-Hellman exponential key exchange
algorithm for session key exchange is patented, at least in the U.S.A.  
The U.S. patent number is 4,200,770.  This little fact isn't mentioned 
in most papers that discuss the algorithm, and it's easy for someone
who's just learned about the algorithm to overlook this important detail.

Licensing rights to the patent are held, I believe, by Public Key Partners
of Sunnyvale, California, with whom I have no affiliation.

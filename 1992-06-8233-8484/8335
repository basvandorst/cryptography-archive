A good way to identify students is to take their Social Security #, or
"Lastname,_Firstname,_MiddleInitial" (where "_" is a required space), and then
run either a Federal standard CRC-32, or CCITT polynomial on this unique data.
I would personally recommend using CRC-32, because it is the U.S. telecomm standard. A student could then give their unique info, the CRC-32 would be generated,
and the student could from that point forward be referred to as "2F61" or any 
given 4-digit base 16 number. If the student forgot their number (less likely than forgetting a locker combo isn't it?), the same standard unique data could be re-entered, and the student could be reminded of their "ID". This would be feasable in many installations since even if the 99.997 percent accuracy of the
CRC-32 were exceeded, (i.e. two people having the same ID #) the names would be so radically different that it wouldn't matter anyway.... EVEN BETTER! Have an
eight digit ID. * Unique data => CRC-32 algorithm = CRC#1.* Then to make it 
foolproof the second quad would consist of  *Unique Data + CRC#1 => CRC-32
algorithm = CRC#2.*  I invite comments from all you math types on how
"guaranteeably unique" this system would be. The system would be much faster 
than something based on military grade Message Digest technology, besides the 
fact I don't trust anybody to remember ANYTHING that cryptographically secure
(read "LONG"). There isn't a need for it either as it pays for anyone to be 
able to figure out your "ID".


OOPS, such a net.newbie I don't even have a .signature file yet....

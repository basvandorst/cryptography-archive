If Mr. Carp's landlord requires a security deposit, and 
if he lives in a State (like Maryland) that requires a
landlord to put security deposits into an interest-bearing
account and to pay a tenant, when he moves out, some or
all of the interest on his security deposit, then that
interest is taxable income to the tenant.  The landlord
is required by Federal law to report that income to the 
Internal Revenue Service on a Form 1099 bearing the tenant's 
Social Security Number.

Of course, this means that the landlord has no need to know
the tenant's Social Security Number until the tenant is 
about to move out.

Why would they like to know the origin of them?  What business is it of
theirs?

This would be worse than the existing system.  If I suspect you might be
posting through the wizvax system, I merely encrypt your address with
the algorithm and look for postings with that alias.  If you try to keep
the algorithm secure, I could just forge a test message from your email
address.  Something akin to the un*x password system is not viable
because real mail addresses aren't secret the way passwords are.

Why even keep the algorithm?  If you're willing to eliminate the ability
to respond to a poster via email, you don't need aliases at all, just
"anonymous@wixvax".

Whats wrong with that method?  Sounds alot more random than any computer
program doing it.  If you disconnect the antenna and short it, it'll be
even more random.  A similar method involves using a lightpen on a TV tuned
to a vacant channel.

A method I found to work quite well was to produce diode white noise,
highpass filter it at a rather high frequency (above 100kHz to avoid
50/60Hz disturbance) pass it thru a toggle flipflop and use!  The
other side of the D-flop can be used to clock the truely "random" data
stream.  Placing the whole device in a well shielded RF box and bringing
out the bits with fibre, will result in the second best thing to using the
decay of "something radioactive", without the objections of having "something
radioactive" at your home or work.

I've been following the discussion about trustworthy random number algorithms,
and I have a (rather novice) question.  Sorry to post it here & waste every-
body's time.  If you have a suggestion where it could better be posted, please
e-mail me.

I'm teaching myself C, and, as an exercise for the student,
I've been attempting to implement a number of algorithms from Knuth's
"The Art of Computer Programming" including Algorithm M from v2 pp31-32
(I believe).  Unfortunately, I'm having just a bit of trouble imping
it.  Would anybody who has imped it in C be willing to give me some hints?
 
Thanx, and sorry for wasting everybody's time on this sort of question.
 
Peace,
 
Doug

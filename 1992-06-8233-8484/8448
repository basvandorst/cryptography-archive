Now you're getting to some good points.  A serious problem with using
the Unix password algorithm isn't whether it's good enough, but whether
it's available on enough systems.   I've been led to believe that it's
not public domain - is that true?  Is there no easy way to make it
available on other platforms?  For exampile, I have my own version (a
rewrite of crypt() for speed.)  Could I distribute it since it doesn't
contain any actual code from the original crypt()?

Where can I get info on MD5?  Is it, as you say, public domain?  Would
there be any problem in including MD5 code in news software that would
be sent all over the world?

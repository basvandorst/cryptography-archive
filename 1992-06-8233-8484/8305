Among other things, this fascinating paper describes a large-scale
test of Unix password security, encompassing about 15,000 accounts,
and using about 12 DECstation 3100 cpu months.  A total of about
25% of the passwords were cracked.  Note that the "cost/benefit"
ratios of different cracking strategies differed greatly, i.e. a
substantial fraction of the passwords were cracked *very* easily.
Read the paper for further details.


In addition, the paper

in the same proceedings is also directly relevant to this topic.

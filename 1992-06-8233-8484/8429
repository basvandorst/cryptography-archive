          If the data is true noise (no serial correlation), all you
need to do is read two values from the input.  If the first is greater
than the second, output a 1.  If the first is less than the second,
output a 0.  If both are equal, don't output anything.  Iterate this
until the desired number of bits have been obtained.

          This removes any bias in the measurement space, but does 
NOT remove any serial correlation.  If there's hum in the input, for
example, this bias will be reflected in the output.

          Hooking up a noise source rather than relying on amplifier
noise would be a good idea.  However, beware of digital psuedo-noise
sources such as the National MM5437; those are feedback shift register
devices, not quantum noise generators like a diode.  See the "Gated
Noise Source" circuit in the ARRL handbook for a simple noise source.
Just discard the gating circuit.

Actually, I think it was a bit more complicated. They also noted the
very real problems of trying to build a machine this big. It is one
thing to say, "Take 1,000,000 chips and glue them together..." and it
is another to do it. Building massively parallel machines is no easy
job even when the processors are as simple or as dedicated as they
would be in this machine. Thinking Machines loves to talk about their
teraflop design, but it hasn't been built and I'm sure that electronic
noise, cross-talk, energy drain and the ever-present heat are going to
be major headaches.

Now it is fair to say that this is just an argument about cost because
most of these problems can be solved if you just throw enough cash at
the system. There are more than 1 million PCs in the country. Hiring 1
million clerks and putting them in front of 1 million PCs is an
extreme and silly solution that shows that it is "possible to 
do". But there are an awful lot of technical hurdles along the way.

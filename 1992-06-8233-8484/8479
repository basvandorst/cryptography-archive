Also, you had better get a printer for that PC, and only print out PGP
messages; if they appear on your screen, they could be electronically
snooped.

Oh, and of course a paper shredder, to make sure that the
letters are not snooped out of your garbage.

Naturally, you'll have to check over every single line of machine code
(not source code, unless you trust the compiler) of every program on the
machine to make sure it's not sending your message to the people at
Prodigy or something.  Also better test all the chips in your cheap PC;
maybe the guy who sold it to you "cheap" hid a transmitter in it or
something.

Also, you'll have to install a burglar alarm in your house, to make
sure nobody breaks in and gets access to your PC with the keys on it.

Plus you'll have to hire a personal bodyguard for you and your entire
family, to make sure nobody coerces the key out of you.  In fact, you
probably should lock yourself in a sealed and shielded room with your
cheap PC and throw away the key to ensure the privacy of the mail.

[Serious answer:  I've heard there are people working on it.  I still
dunno about the progress, nor whether the legal status has been
resolved.]

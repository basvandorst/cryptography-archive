Subject: help needed on Reed-Solomon soft decision error correcting code
Lines: 19

I am a student looking for information on realtime implementations of
Reed-Solomon error-correcting codes utilizing soft decision information.
I understand that a Reed-Solomon fully utilizing soft decision is very
complicated, but I would also be very interested in any information about
soft decision information utilized in only part of the decision process.

If you can help me out in this area with pointers to good papers, descriptions,
or even snippets of code, please mail to jq07+@andrew.cmu.edu or to the
address which appears in this message's header, if it is different.  I do
not usually read comp.programming or sci.crypt, so replies posted here will
not reach me.

Thanks for your help.

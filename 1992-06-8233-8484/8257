Casino slot machines are not algorithmically vulnerable.
They use hardware random-number generators which generate
numbers continuously.  When you engage the game, the number
showing is shifted into the processing elements.  There is
no way to predict the next number unless you can control
your own motions to the microsecond.  The rng's could all
start with seed 0, every time they're powered up, and
there'd be no way to make consistent predictions about the
selected value.

They know how it happened.  The machines' manufacturers had
at first claimed there was nothing that could have gone wrong,
but later discovered that the two microprocessors they were
using couldn't actually be sync'ed with each other 100% of
the time.

The clue that it was a systematic problem was that there
were no large payouts at all during the tournament, when
there should have been on the order of 200 large payouts.

I agree that the CM-5 is not the same thing as a parallel DES cracking
engine, but many of the arguments from the 1980s applied to these
machines. Electrical power and heat are the biggest. Effective signal
routing is not in the same ballpark (or even the same state.)

I think we are really arguing about semantic differences about what is
"massive". In fact we essentially agree the machine "could" be built.
I was just pointing out some of the NBS panel's objections from back
in 1977. They didn't believe the basic arguments of Diffie and Hellman
about heat and weight. You can. Everything is academic until you start
soldering. That was 1977.  Now things are admittedly a bit different
and DES is looking a bit long in the tooth.

There are some recent estimates on the cost of making the machine:

@article{GarOut,
author="Gilles Garon and Richard Outerbridge",
title="DES Watch: And Examination of the Sufficiency of the Data
Encryption Standard for Financial Institution's Information Security
in the 1990's",
journal="Cryptologia",
volume=15,
number=3,
Month="July",
pages={177-193},
year="1991"}

They estimate that it would cost $104 million to construct a machine
to do the job in one day in 1990. That's $14 million for a machine
that could do it in a week. If D and H's cost predictions were so
accurate, why hasn't the cost changed drastically in the latest
article that comes 14 years later?

I still don't believe that these estimates are anything more than
ballpark numbers. They aren't talking about real hardware that people
are building right now. They need someone to redesign the current DES
chip to includes extra glue logic. Maybe this would be easy to do with
a Xylogics PLA, but who knows.

56 bits is looking a little too small. Still, the first standard was a
pretty good approximation for what could be done in silicon back then.
Moreover, a very good paper by Biham and Shamir showed that 56 bits
were optimal and 768 bits of key wouldn't be any more secure with the
current design. The more I read, the more I believe the IBM/NSA team
that designed DES and the less I believe back of the envelope
calculations. It's a wonderful mathematical field full of rich
surprises.

Would I be surprised if the NSA had such a machine? No. Would I be
surprised if it took lots of high-level meetings of NSA engineers and
department heads to determine if the project was worth the
expenditure? Yes.  Remember, the Russians and anyone else happened to
be a spy wasn't about to start using DES to protect their data. It
just wouldn't make a whit of sense. The opponents have their own
cryptographers who can turn up something useful and different very
quickly. Why engrave everything in silicon?

Yes, $20 million is nothing to a government defense agency, but ask
yourself which would you rather have in _any_ sort of conflict: A DES
machine or a F/18. Is there going to be anyone out there using DES? In
Nicaragua? In Iraq? In the former East Germany? In Gus Hall's
American Communist Party?

Just some thoughts.

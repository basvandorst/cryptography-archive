I've done a bit of experimenting with a Sun /dev/audio (which is basically
a 8kHz 12-bit sampled data packed by uLaw encoding to 8-bit data).  You can
get some low-bit random noise by turning the record gain all the way up
without a input device (microphone) connected or switched off.  This seems
like a pretty resonable (though slow) way to produce "real" random numbers.

A simple experiment is the pipeline
	ulawtolin < /dev/audio | more
which will give a series of small random numbers (around -100...100), which
are pretty biased (seems lowest two bits tend to be zero etc.).

What kind of a methods can you suggest for producing "clean" random
bitstreams from this kind of biased data ?

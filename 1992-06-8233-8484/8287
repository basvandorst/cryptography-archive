I agree, except for one small detail.  As pointed out in "Codebreakers",
many small countries used Enigma into the sixties because it provided
some security from their enemies, though not from the major powers, and
was cheap.  The point being that this level of technology was the best
they could afford.  The implication being, that NSA regularly read these
messages.  My guess is, and this is only a guess, that there are some
foreign countries in this same position regarding DES.  They can't
afford technology that is adequate against the power NSA can bring to
bear on the problem and so use what is cheap knowing that their enemies
can't afford the equipment to break the DES messages.  NSA probably
still reads their mail.

   What I am really trying to say is that this noise is not random but
   is characteristic of the specific circuit design being used.
   One could gain statistical knowlege of the "real" random numbers
   being generated by knowing the specific work sation design.
   For example, one could know that there will be bursts of noise
   synchronized to the frequency of the switching regulator
   used in the system. 

More interestingly, if we feed the output of a radio tuned to a random
dead frequency into /dev/audio and use THAT as a RNG, will it be
really random, or not?

Isn't this missing the point though? The whole point of the public key
encrytion codes was that loss of the encoder key does not mean that the
data can be unscrambled. 

Computer security systems must by their nature frequently store the key
in the machine.

A reduction in the cracking time to `several years' is a significant
problem. Silicon compilation makes the design of a custom cracker chip
quite feasible on a reasonable budget. Fill a board with them and run
them in parallel. the several years can soon be brought down to several
days. With increases in chip speed a figure of several hours is probably
achievable.

2^47 means a solution in 1628 days at a rate of 1 million attempts/sec
or 2 days at 1 billion attempts/sec.

With ready avaliablility of chips pushing 100 mips the advent of a 1000
node farm of 1000 mip processors for $250,000 is not far off.

The `authorities' may have much better techniques than the Shamir algorithm.

Lets face it DES is dead.

Sorry if this is a really stupid question, but with all the discussion of
cracking various "secure" encryption schemes, this thought came to mind.

In order to get Truly Safe (TM) encryption, wouldn't the best method be
to run the plaintext through several encryption schemes (eg RSA, then
DES), and in addition to keeping the keys safe, also keep the types and
order of the crypt algorithms safe?

I realize that in order to send secure data across a network or other
medium at least two (people/machines) need to know these things, but given
a choice of, say, 2 crypto systems (for simplicity, add more for further
security), and 2 rounds, there are only 6 permutations, and a sequence can
easily be determined beforehand.  (The permutations of 2 crypto systems, A
and B, with 2 rounds, are:  A, B, AA, AB, BB, BA.  Again, add more crypto
schemes and more rounds for added security.)  Someone trying to crack the
encryption would not only have to crack the crypto scheme, but also know
the type of encryption and the number of rounds and order of encryption.
It seems to me that it would be infinitely more difficult to decrypt a 
message which decrypts to an encrypted message than it would be to decrypt
a message which decrypts to plain text.

Am I way off base here, or is this something which has been proven to not
work, or is it simply such an obvious idea that nobody wants to discuss
it?

Thanks -

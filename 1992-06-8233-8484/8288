an anyone please point me to an archive or a reference about voice
encryption. 
  Several companies sell different voice scrambling products with programmable
codes. ( CRYPTO VOICE PLUS,-I, -II) from Motorola, or CVP from Transcrupt Int.,
or the ST-25 from Selectone,......
  I presume that the method employed consists of continiously changing the 
carrier for frequency inversion. If so, how do they achieve synchronization 
between receiver and transmitter?

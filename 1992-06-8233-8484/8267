A friend of mine used to do this with some of the (semi-legal) gambling  
machines around here.  He'd created some sort of table which listed sequences 
and/or probabilities, and every week or so used to spend several hours  
cleaning out a few of the local machines.  I remember him wandering in  
halfway through lectures, pockets bulging with 20 cent pieces....despite this 
he graduated and his since moved on to an email-impaired site so I can't ask  
him for more details.

Depends on your resources. If you can get 1K encrypted in a decent time
using a workstation I can get 250K encoded in the same time using a
parallel farm.

Precisely what I expect. The Polish resistance managed it in WWII.

Of course if I did I wouldn't tell you, would I?

But it is important to be able to judge the probability of someone
cracking a code.

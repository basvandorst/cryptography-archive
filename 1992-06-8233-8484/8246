Around here coin-op gambling machines have become legalized. There are a lot
of machines which play a 3x3 grid of icon's like red 7s, bells, gold bars,
etc. They have 4 colored buttons used to play... Cash out/Odds/Play/Bet.
When you hit the play button items roll through the windows until they
come to a stop and you win credits for 3-in-a-row, etc. They are sometimes
called Singing Bells or somesuch. Anyway, I hope you get the idea.


They are completely electronic machines, or so it seems, and the random
number generation is probably done by a psuedo-random number generating
algorithm.

Given observations of the states of many successive screens, might one be
able to ferrit out the particular seeds being used, and then use that
information to predict the upcoming sequences? This is a problem which
would (I assume) require a certain degree of knowledge of the algorithm
being used, and the mechanics of how often it is re-seeded, etc, etc along
with a good chunk of computing power to hunt down the particular seeds, etc
in use. But it seems do-able, perhaps.


Does anyone have any information on the likely algorithm used, and the nature
of the parameters it gets fed to seed it, how likely they are to change the
seed, and how feasible it would be to reverse engineer the seed to then
predict upcoming sequences?

This looks like the common mistake of assuming that crystal oscillators
are uncorrelated.  In fact, that's not even close to true.

A number of years ago, a certain large computer company was working on
an early implementation of Ethernet.  As you know, this relies on random
numbers and uncorrelated behavior among the nodes.  Some paper analysis
was done which "showed" that the various oscillators would, statistically,
be synchronized about every 10^10 years.

Then a 3-node network was built, and it locked up in about 10 minutes.
The cause?  Crystals don't have anything close to a Gaussian distribution;
instead, the distribution is bimodal with very sharp peaks.  (The reason
is simple: the manufacturing process involves selection, and crystals
go into the highest-price bin their measured frequency justifies.  Thus
the .01% crystals have two sharp peaks: one at +.01%, and one at -.01%
from the nominal frequency.)

One should know -- and one could know.  In applications like this, you
need to consider the program "guilty until proven innocent".  In particular,
running a few tests that don't "find any flaws in it" doesn't tell you
anything.

Coincidentally, I was just a few minutes ago reading an article by E.W.Dijkstra
explaining why it is absurd to think of computer science as an experimental
science.  Here we have a case in point...

(Unfortunately, the same thing is true for word processors, judging by
some recent books...)

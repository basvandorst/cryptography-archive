I propose a new manner of encryption, where rather than patterns
of signals representing the encryption, encrypted messages would
resemble poetry, in that each line of the encryption would
induce a value judgement based on secret critera.  The "Good-BAd"
value judgements would correspond to "dot-dash" or "zero-one" binary
representations.  Here is an example:
Message (Plaintext) S-O-S
Key:
Everybody should like hot dogs with mustard.
\Bannana are ugly.
President Bush is good.

Encrypted Representation:
I hate hotdogs with mustard,
but bananas are beautiful
and President Bush is bad.
Cryptanalysis:
"I hate hotdogs with mustard," False (Dash)
"But Bananas are beautiful" False (Dash)
"And President Bush is Bad" False (Dash)
The true-false is the correspondence to the key, and the dash represents the
morse code (or whatever) representation.  The statements could be continued t
spell out "S-O-S" in plaintext, without compromising.  In addition, the
exact value judgements making up the key can be so subtle and subjective that
only the computer doing the encrypting and the computer doing the decrypt wou
know the "value frequency" (overall value structure) and "value schemata" spe
specific value judgements involved.  Hey, NSA, does this cook your oatmeal?

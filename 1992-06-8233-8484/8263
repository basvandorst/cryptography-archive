My memory of this was that the Germans maintained strict radio silence
not because they thought Enigma was suspect but rather becuse they
{rightly} feared signal intelligence.

SI is, roughly, the process of learning things by the presence of
signals, regardless of their still-unknown content.

For example, the Axis could tell roughly how many B-17's would be in a
raid by listening to them tuning up their transmitters while still on
the ground. You can also get an idea of a change in the activity level
by looking at how many messages were directed to a given HQ. (The
address header typically is in the clear so that the operators know
where it goes.) For that reason the Allies put Eisenhower's transmitter
nearer to Patton's spoof First U.S. Army Group, and ran long phone
lines to it from the REAL HQ.

By keeping all traffic about the attack on landline, the Germans
eliminated the hazard.

I am posting this on behalf of this person who replied to my question about
DES and whether it had been broken or not.

Subject: simple DES non-recommended by IBM.

I did a double interview of RSA-Shamir and some german guy from the original 
DES team, about 3 years back here in Paris. At the time Shamir had a public 
demo of breaking 8 rounds of DES on a PC, provided the original plain-text
obeyed certain statistical properties. He would not comment on his ability 
to break the full (is it 16 rounds?) DES.

At the same time, this german guy from IBM's cryptology competence center,
when asked whether DES was safe, said sure, however we recommend our clients
double-encrypt :-). He also said something about "acres of computers"
being needed to break DES :-)

I think that DES has had it. Only it is not yet public knowledge.

Edmund.

About a year ago there was a net-assisted math research project. I
can't remember the details, but it involved individual sysmjrs running
some background job with a very polite nice factor, with the results
being mailed back to the experimenters.

It occurs to me that, despite the vast difference between this task and
that one, and this resource and the proposed parallel machine, that
maybe a similar project is not impossible, either. After all, there is
an evergrowing number of unused MIPS available net-wide. [Has anyone
taken the time to graph the net-MIPS vs. time curve? Is it linear, e^n
or ....]

I suspect, however, that a serious proposal of such a project would
meet with vocal objections on many fronts. Thus, this is baseless,
impossible_to_implement fantasy.

Anyhow, I'd better go - somebody is hammering on my door ;_}

This statement keeps coming up, and I thought it was dismissed a few
months ago. If it wasn't, it should have been.

I was present at Don Coppersmith's "Coming Out" at IBM's T.J. Watson
Research Center about 6 months ago. And I have seen, in this news
group, a summary of what he said. Don was one of the team who designed
DES for the NSA, and had been sworn to secrecy for 17 years.

Basically, the S-boxes were designed specifically to be resistant to a
Biham-Shamir type differential cryptanalysis attack. Don presented
specific design criteria for the S-boxes which *unconditionally*
increased complexity as a single bit delta between two inputs was
cascaded through the system. (Note that it has long been said that a
single bit change to the input should result in about half of the
output bits changing. The essence of the differential analysis attack
is that this isn't necessarily true for *all* possible 1-bit different
input pairs, but it pretty much is for DES.)

In response to a specific question: "Are the design criteria you've
just presented the only ones? Did you just throw random numbers at it
until a set matched the criteria?", Don stated, "Yes."

Basically, the NSA and the design team knew about that kind of attack.
But the technique was too powerful to disclose, and releasing the
design criteria for the S-boxes would have made it pretty darn obvious
(the connection was obvious even to me, and I am but an egg).  So now
the truth is out (yes, I believe the above to be truth), and we don't
have to worry about the NSA designing in trapdoors. That they might
have built a machine fast enough to do brute force is still a
possibility, but so what. They can apply that kind of technology to
anything.

Could something like this go into the FAQ, if it isn't already? I'm too
old for all this paranoia.

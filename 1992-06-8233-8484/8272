If you read the articles carefully, you'll see that:

- A team of people have reduced the number of tries in a brute-force
  attack from 2^56 to 2^47, which reduces the time needed from several
  centuries to several years. HOWEVER, this is only if you are able to
  provide plaintext to be encrypted, and are able to analyze the result
  with the plaintext. Then you can find out the key, and decrypt
  everything else with the same key. Thus if you change the key on a
  regular basis, or don't allow the enemy to encrypt his test plaintext,
  it's not a problem.
- Several people have decrypted a DES version that uses just 8 or less
  rounds. Real DES uses 25 rounds. Even if you can decrypt a DES
  version that uses 24 rounds, this doesn't mean you can decrypt DES
  that uses 25 rounds.

So, real DES is still safe.

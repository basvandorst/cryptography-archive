Nearly _any_ textbook on cryptography would answer these questions.

How sad that so many university students now prefer to post questions
than to do library catalog lookups.  Most universities now have
electronic catalogs, so it should no longer be easier to post than to
lookup at the library, and the results obtained at the library will
likely be more reliable, more complete, and obtained at least as fast.

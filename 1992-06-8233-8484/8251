I have read many articles in the Crypto proceedings about RSA chip
development over the years.  Last night I read an interesting article
in The Public Key (a sort of hobby journal from U.K.) about a company
called Thorn-EMI that is developing a PC plug-in board to do large
integer math, including modular exponentiation.  The prototype was
tested and seems to run quite fast.  However, the company has no
definite plans to manufacture and market such a device.

So, are there any actual commercial RSA implementations, especialy in
the form of a plug-in board for PCs?  Alternatively, any available
DSP boards for which appropriate software is available?  I seem to 
recall several articles on this topic but am unaware of any available
software (commercial, bbs) implementing the published methods.

I can imagine that specific RSA hardware, at least here in the US, would
be subject to the evil RSA patent and royalties thereto.  However, free    
software for private use for a DSP board should be as available as the 
various RSA software packages.  Also, would imported software/devices
be subject to the US patent if they were written/manufactured in a country
where RSA is not patented?

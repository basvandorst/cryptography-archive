Could anyone please point me to a *reliable* source of reference (best
already published) which records, for example, that 40% user password
on a system were found (cracked) by searching through an on-line
dictionary of words (or similar things)?  I recall seeing lots of such
numbers floating around, but could not pin one down when I want to
refer to them.  Thanks in advance.

Li

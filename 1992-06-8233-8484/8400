Well thought. As said before I urge ANYONE to test and think all they
like about my generator. Either discussed on news or emailed to me.
I collect all results and will make a nice overview of it in a few weeks.
The more sceptic you are the better. If it has flaws they can't be detected
fast enough.

I doubth it is worth a paper (the principle behind it is not new I believe)
but there will be a "summary".

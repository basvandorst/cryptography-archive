The feedback positions are the non-zero coefficients of a GF(2) polynomial
of degree less than "m", where "m" is the length of the shift register.
(Which is equivalent to saying that the polynomial "names" an element
in GF(2^m).) To be a "maximal-length" LFSR, that is, to generate (2^m)-1
different values w/o repeating, the corresponding polynomial has to be
"primitive". [That is, the corresponding element of GF(2^m) has to be
primitive in GF(2^m).]

Primitive polynomials are the Galois Field equivalents of prime numbers in
the rational field. Like primes, you find small ones by exhaustive search
(i.e., pick a polynomial, run the associated shift register until the value
repeats, see if it's the "2^m"th time -- if less, it's not primitive). You
find large ones with better math than I have under my belt.

Most books on coding theory will have a table in an appendix that lists
some primitive polynomials in GF(2) up to some "m". For example, Peterson
and Weldon's "Error-Correcting Codes", Appendix C, lists all irreducible
and primitive polynomials up to degree 16, and at least one primitive
polynomials for each degree up to 34. [I don't know of a source beyond 34.]

Here is a primitive polynomial of degree 34 (from P & W):

	10 000 001 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 111

It'll make a dandy pseudo-random noise generator, with only 34 flip-flops
and 3 XOR gates (e.g., four 74LS374's and a 16R4 PAL).

Useless for crypto, of course.

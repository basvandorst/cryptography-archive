I forgot something important.

The IBM-PC (the real & origional one) uses a single Crystal for both
the microprocessor and the "real time clock". This should mean my
algo doesn't work on that type of machine.

I have not yet been able to test this. If anyone can please. The results
on a single crystal machine would also generate interesting info on
the ability of the program to measure phase noise.

<H2>Patent rights on the algorithms</H2>
<P>The RSA public key cryptosystem was developed at MIT, which holds a
patent on it (U.S. patent #4,405,829, issued 20 Sep 1983).  A company
in California called Public Key Partners (PKP) holds the exclusive
commercial license to sell and sub-license the RSA public key
cryptosystem.  MIT distributes a freeware version of PGP under the
terms of the RSAREF license from RSA Data Security, Inc. (RSADSI).
<P>At the time of this writing (September 1994), it appears that PKP may
be breaking up soon, in which case the patents they hold may fall into
other hands.  The RSA patent may end up with RSADSI.
<P>Non-US users of earlier versions of PGP should note that the RSA
patent does not apply outside the US, and at least at the time of
this writing, the author is not aware of any RSA patent in any other
country.  Federal agencies may use the RSA algorithm, because the
Government paid for the development of RSA with grants from the
National Science Foundation and the Navy.  But despite the fact of
Government users having free access to the RSA algorithm, Government
use of PGP has additional restrictions imposed by the agreement I
have with ViaCrypt, as explained later.
<P>I wrote my PGP software from scratch, with my own independently
developed implementation of the RSA algorithm.  Before publishing PGP
in 1991, I got a formal written legal opinion from a patent attorney
with extensive experience in software patents.  I'm convinced that
publishing PGP the way I did does not violate patent law.
<P>Not only did PKP acquire the exclusive patent rights for the RSA
cryptosystem, but they also acquired the exclusive rights to three
other patents covering other public key schemes invented by others at
Stanford University, also developed with federal funding.  This
one company claims to have a legal lock in the USA on nearly all
practical public key cryptosystems.  They even appear to be claiming
patent rights on the very concept of public key cryptography,
regardless of what clever new original algorithms are independently
invented by others.  I find such a comprehensive monopoly troubling,
because I think public key cryptography is destined to become a
crucial technology in the protection of our civil liberties and
privacy in our increasingly connected society.  At the very least,
it places these vital tools at risk by affording to the Government
a single pressure point of influence.
<P>Beginning with PGP version 2.5 (distributed by MIT, the holders of
the original RSA patent), the freeware version of PGP uses the RSAREF
subroutine library to perform its RSA calculations, under the RSAREF
license, which allows noncommercial use in the USA.  RSAREF is a
subroutine package from RSA Data Security Inc, that implements the
RSA algorithm.  The RSAREF subroutines are used instead of PGP's
original subroutines to implement the RSA functions in PGP.  See the
RSAREF license for terms and conditions of use of RSAREF
applications.
<P>PGP 2.5 was released by MIT for a brief test period in May, 1994
before releasing 2.6.  PGP 2.5 was released under the 16 March, 1994
RSAREF license, which is a perpetual license, so it may legally be
used forever in the US.  But it would be better for PGP's legal and
political future for users in the United States to upgrade to version
2.6 or later to facilitate the demise of PGP 2.3a and earlier
versions.  Also, PGP 2.5 has bugs that are corrected in 2.6, and 2.5
will not read the new data format after September 1, 1994.  (See the
section on <A HREF="pgpdoc2_51.html#0">Compatibility with Previous and Future Versions of
  PGP</A>.)
<P>The PGP 2.0 release was a joint effort of an international team of
software engineers, implementing enhancements to the original PGP
with design guidance from me.  It was released by Branko Lankester in
The Netherlands and Peter Gutmann in New Zealand, out of reach of US
patent law.  Although released only in Europe and New Zealand, it
spontaneously spread to the USA without help from me or the PGP
development team.
<P>The IDEA(tm) conventional block cipher used by PGP is covered by a
patent in Europe, held by ETH and a Swiss company called Ascom-Tech
AG.  The US Patent number is 5,214,703, and the European patent
number is EP 0 482 154 B1.  IDEA(tm) is a trademark of Ascom-Tech AG.
There is no license fee required for noncommercial use of IDEA.
Commercial users of IDEA may obtain licensing details from Dieter
Profos, Ascom Tech AG, Teleservices Section, Postfach 151, 4502
Solothurn, Switzerland, Tel +41 65 242885, Fax +41 65 235761.   
<P>Ascom-Tech AG has granted permission for the freeware version PGP to
use the IDEA cipher in non-commercial uses, everywhere.  In the US
and Canada, all commercial or Government users must obtain a licensed
version from ViaCrypt, who has a license from Ascom-Tech for the IDEA
cipher.  
<P>Ascom-Tech has recently been changing its policies regarding the use
of IDEA in PGP for commercial use outside the US, and that policy
still seems to be in flux.  They tell me that their current thinking
is as follows:  They will allow commercial users of PGP outside the
US or Canada to use IDEA in PGP without paying royalties to
Ascom-Tech, because it is not currently possible for commercial users
to buy a licensed version of PGP outside the US or Canada.  If the
legal situation in the USA changes in the future, so that users
outside the US or Canada can buy a licensed version of PGP (either
from ViaCrypt, or from me, or from a foreign enterprise licensed by
me), then Ascom-Tech will begin enforcing its patent licensing
policies on commercial users who are in a position to buy a licensed
version of PGP.  To get a more up-to-date report on this, contact
Ascom-Tech AG.
<P>The ZIP compression routines in PGP come from freeware source code,
with the author's permission.  I'm not aware of any patents on the
compression algorithms used in the ZIP routines.

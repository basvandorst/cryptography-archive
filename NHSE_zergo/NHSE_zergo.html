<A NAME="Management_summary"><P></A>
<H2>1 Management summary</H2>

<P>Zergo Limited has been commissioned by the Information Management
Group of the NHS Executive (IMG) to undertake a study looking at the
ramifications of using encryption and related services across the
NHS-wide Network (NWN) also known as the NHSnet. The principal
requirement, which is for the confidentiality of Person Identifiable
Data, is assumed. The study is to consider the ways in which
encryption could be provided across the network, in the context of
those networked systems that exchange Person Identifiable Data. It is
then to recommend how encryption could best be provided to meet the
NHS's requirement given the current relevant technical and business
strategies, and to advise the NHS on the ramifications of that
approach including the likely costs and benefits that would
arise. Finally, it is to consider in what ways the encryption approach
could be extended to provide other related network security services
in a cost-effective manner.

<P>The main results of this study are that

<UL>

<P><LI>the needed technology has recently become available to allow
encryption to be provided across the NHSnet in a versatile and
beneficial manner, and in a way that is responsive to need and
cost. Importantly, the use of encryption by some systems for some data
does not require the use of encryption by all systems or for all data
</LI>

<P><LI>the NHS's needs should be addressed by a family of related
encryption products built on the <I>Red Pike</I> encryption
algorithm. This algorithm has recently been made available to the NHS
by CESG, the National Technical Security Authority within HMG </LI>

<P><LI>the introduction of encryption facilities will not be a panacea
for solving all the information security problems associated with
networking NHS systems </LI>

<P><LI>the encryption facilities could be used in a mariner which is
highly automated and manageable </LI>

<P><LI>the implementation process will be by no means simple There are
a number of management and technical issues that will need to be
addressed within the implementation programme for the encryption
facilities. However, an approach is identified that will reduce the
associated risks to a manageable level </LI>

<P><LI>the recommended facilities should be readily extendible to
support the provision and use of related cryptographic services such
as Digital Signatures to prevent unauthorised tampering with the
communicated data and to link unambiguously the communicated data to
the identities of the parties involved in its exchange </LI>

<P><LI>the NHS will need to develop a key management infrastructure to
sit across the many different systems that will become
encryption-enabled. This infrastructure will require one or more
Trusted Third Part, (TTP) management centres, though the staffing
requirements for these will be small </LI>

<P><LI>the potential benefits will be considerable if encryption is
found to be a precondition for extensive use of the network services
by clinicians. The expected costs are small in comparison with the
costs of the IT facilities with which they would be used, and in
proportion with the expected costs of networking </LI>

<P><LI>the main manpower costs for the NHS will relate to the running
of the pilot and subsequent implementations. For these, the MIS will
need to provide a few tens of man-years of internal staff
resource. There is the potential for approximately £250,000 worth
of external expert security consultancy to assist in these
programmes. The day to day operation of the TTP(s) will require only a
handful of staff, at most eight full time equivalent staff. There will
not be the need for many thousands of users to be trained up before
encryption can be used </LI>

<P><LI>the possible equipment costs for introducing encryption across
the NHSnet could well be in the range £ 15M to £ 20M, spread
over an implementation programme spanning several years. At the end of
this programme, the annual on-going costs could be expected to be in
the range £2.5M to £3M. </LI>

</UL>

<P>The study considers the range of contexts with which encryption
might be appropriate and concludes that there are many. From this it
goes on to deduce that what is required is a small family of related
encryption products rather than just a single product. The family of
products would allow encryption to be provided according to the needs
of individual systems. Encryption could be provided either as part of
the user's application or in conjunction with the user's networking
facilities. It could be provided for those systems that require it
without it being necessary for all systems to use it regardless of
need. And the needed central management facilities (one or more TTPs -
trusted facilities to manage cryptographic keys on behalf of users)
would be readily scalable, allowing an initially small management
facility to be established, and for this subsequently to take on the
support of a growing community of users without the need for a large
central management or Head Office team.

<P>There are a number of established providers of the needed types of
security products that should be able to support the NHS's needs,
allowing the NHS to enjoy the benefits of a competitive
marketplace. The central management facilities could be provided in a
number of ways including either as a bespoke development for operation
by the NHS or as a Private Finance Initiative for operation by an
external trusted third party service provider.

<P>The study recommends that the encryption facilities should be
implemented in a staged manner which allows the management and
technical issues to be addressed in a controlled and steady way. A
staged pilot should be defined to prove the feasibility of using
encryption across the NHSnet, to test its use with a number of
different types of system, and to allow the measurement of a number of
technical and management parameters. After consideration of the
results of the first stage of the pilot, a strategy should be defined
for implementing the encryption facilities in stages to cover both new
and existing networked systems according to priority and need. It
should be expected that implementations could be started before all
the stages of the pilot have been completed. The implementation
program is likely to extend over a number of years, though the
benefits from using encryption will be felt from the first stage of
the implementation. An outline of the steps that will be needed for
the pilot and subsequent implementations is given within this
report.



<A NAME="Introduction"><P></A>
<H2>2 Introduction</H2>

<P>The NHS is in the early stages of implementing the NHS-Wide Network
(NWN) also known as the NHSnet. The NWN has an associated NWN Security
Policy and Codes of Connection, and guidelines on the use of access
controls on the network. The network does not presently have any
general provision for the use of encryption or related cryptographic
services for protecting the confidentiality of data transmitted across
the network.

<P>However, a number of technical barriers which have made the use of
encryption by the NHS difficult in the past have been lowered
recently. These include general product developments in the
cryptography marketplace, greater experience in the security
management of large and diverse networks, and a change in policy and
approach by the relevant government department (CESG - the
Communications-Electronics Security Group). These have, amongst other
things, shown that encryption can be employed by organisations which
are large and diverse and which do not follow a strictly hierarchical
organisational structure.

<P>As a result, and mindful of the possible need for such services,
the NHS Executive in September 1995 commissioned Zergo Limited to
undertake a study to investigate the ramifications of providing
encryption and related services across the NWN.

<P>The objectives of the study were:

<UL>

<P><LI>to examine the contexts in which encryption and other data
security services would be required for the exchange of Person
Identifiable Data across the NWN </LI>

<P><LI>to describe suitable techniques for implementing these security
services </LI>

<P><LI>to identify and describe the many different impacts the
recommended facilities would have on the various parties involved in
the use and operation of the NWN, including the likely benefits and
expected costs for each stakeholder </LI>

<P><LI>to identify and discuss an implementation approach appropriate
to the particular environment of the NWN where the end user
organisations enjoy a great deal of autonomy. </LI></UL>


<P>This report draws on a requirements study carried out by C
International Ltd. The scope of that study was to identify all current
and expected future information flows (both interactive sessions and
massaging oriented) that might need to use encryption facilities
across the NWN. Given the high number of potential data flows, it was
decided to focus the analysis on the primary healthcare sector. This
was expected to embrace all the issues concerning security and would
be focusing attention on an area of particular security concern. This
analysis was supplemented by a high level review of other areas of the
NHS to ensure that all significant security requirements had been
identified. The findings of the requirements study were ratified
through a workshop held in December 1995. A summary of the findings is
included within Section 3 of this report.

<P>The organisation of this report is as follows. 

<UL>

<P><LI><I><A HREF="#The_context_for_Security_Services">Section
3</A></I> discusses the expected uses of cryptographic security
services on the NWN. It presents a number of contexts which
characterise the transmission of Person Identifiable Data over the
NWN, and derives the constraints that the implemented security
services would need to satisfy </LI>

<P><LI><I><A HREF="#Recommended_approach">Section 4</A></I> describes
the recommended technologies for providing the encryption
facilities. It considers a number of possible approaches and
identifies that which would provide the NHS with the most strategic
solution </LI>

<P><LI><I><A HREF="#Implementation_issues">Section 5</A></I>
describes the ramifications of implementing NWN encryption according
to the recommended approach given in Section 4. It covers the expected
impacts of the provision and use of encryption, covering both
management and technical issues. It presents a view of the major risks
involved, the tasks that the NHS will have to undertake, and the broad
timescales and costs that could be expected </LI>

<P><LI><I><A HREF="#Benefits">Section 6</A></I> presents the likely
benefits to be gained from the use of encryption and related
services. It discusses these for each of the main stakeholders in the
NWN, and shows how the likely benefits relate to the expected costs
</LI>

<P><LI><I><A HREF="#Implementation">Section 7</A></I> outlines an
implementation programme showing the route by which the NHS can
address the outstanding management and technical issues and prepare
for piloting and implementation. </LI>

</UL>

<P>Further technical detail and discussion underpinning the
recommended approach to the provision of cryptographic facilities
(given in <A HREF="#Recommended_approach">Section 4</A>) is contained
in two appendices:

<UL>

<P><LI><A HREF="#Appendix_B"><I>Appendix B</I></A> discusses the
general form of the encryption facilities that would be needed. It
describes the implementation options to hand and how different options
might be appropriate for different contexts </LI>

<P><LI><A HREF="#Appendix_C"><I>Appendix C</I></A> discusses the
issues relating to the choice of encryption algorithm and key
management infrastructure, and makes recommendations regarding the
selections to be made. </LI>

</UL>

<P>The original Terms of Reference for the study from the NHS
Executive are included as <A HREF="#Appendix_A"><I>Appendix
A</I></A>. Finally, a Glossary of the main security terms used within
the report is provided in <A HREF="#Appendix_D"><I>Appendix D</I></A>.

<P>The Terms of Reference for the study refer to a number of services
relating to the protection of data exchanged across the NWN. These
services, primarily the use of encryption, form just a subset of the
full range of security services to be found within the overall IT
security framework and security infrastructure needed for the
protection of NHS data. Consequently, only a subset of the security
threats applicable to NHS data has been addressed within this study,
principally those that arise from eavesdropping on or tampering with
data transmitted across the NWN. Other threats are being addressed
separately, for example:

<UL>

<P><LI>unauthorised access to systems holding sensitive data, owing to
insufficiently effective system access controls (the sharing of
passwords, unattended terminals being left logged in, etc.) </LI>

<P><LI>inappropriate use of authorised access privileges by NHS staff
(for example, through bribery or coercion, or, as is believed to have
happened recently, as a consequence of a member of staff assisting
someone else whom it was incorrectly assumed was authorised to request
the confidential information) </LI>

<P><LI>eavesdropping and tampering on internal LANs within hospitals,
offices, and practices </LI>

<P><LI>reduced effectiveness of existing controls through a lack of IT
security awareness and general security understanding by users and
operators of IT systems. </LI></UL>

<P>It is important for the reader to understand that the use of
encryption on the NWN will not be a universal security panacea and
that it will not address all of the NHS's security requirements; in
particular, encryption should not be seen as a substitute for having
adequate access controls on the end-systems. Other controls will be
required within the end-systems themselves, and these are the
responsibility of the owners of each end-system. These fall outside
the scope of the current study.

<P>Finally, it must be noted that this study has been commissioned by
the NHS Executive in England in the context of the use of encryption
on the NHSnet available to the NHS in England.

<A NAME="The_context_for_Security_Services"><P></A>
<H2>3 The context for security services</H2>

<H3>3.1 Security Threats</H3>

<P>Current concerns about NWN security are centred on two main
threats:

<UL>

<P><LI>the possibility of unauthorised individuals logging on to the
network </LI>

<P><LI>the possibility of eavesdropping on network traffic. </LI>

</UL>


<P>The primary concern is that, by either of these methods, an
attacker might gain access to confidential Person Identifiable Data.

<P>The threat of unauthorised access to the network is being addressed
through a number of controls including strong user authentication
methods, and these are the subject of other work. Addressing the
remaining eavesdropping threat is the subject of the present study,
and it is this which leads to the consideration of encryption as a
possibly suitable countermeasure. However, encryption, if used
appropriately, does have further value in that it can help prevent
unauthorised access to networked systems or data. Unauthorised users
would find themselves unable to access these systems because they
would not possess the correct decryption keys. Again according to
implementation, authorised users might obtain some protection against
accidental or deliberate misrouting of data (posting confidential data
to an open discussion group, sending a confidential e-mail to the
wrong e-mail address) if the (unintended) recipient did not posses the
correct decryption keys.

<P>It can be argued that that the type of Person Identifiable Data
which will shortly be passed over the NWN has in the past been
transmitted between healthcare professionals by mail or by telephone,
and that similar risks of disclosure have long existed. However, it is
important to realise that the use of electronic means of communication
does introduce new security threats and security risks. For example,
it is relatively easy to automate the process of sifting through a
large amount of text-based message traffic searching for key words and
information particular interest. This kind of eavesdropping is a
threat to communicated Person Identifiable Data and is less laborious
than that of steaming open mail or tapping telephone conversations.

<P>The types of cryptographic techniques needed to counter network
eavesdropping can often be used to deal with a number of other data
security threats which also exist on the NWN, though those
requirements may not be as much to the fore as eavesdropping These
include:

<UL>

<P><LI>deliberate alteration of a message for some malicious purpose
such as fraud or sabotage </LI>

<P><LI>the introduction of messages by one user purporting them to
have been sent by another (spoofing, for example to obtain
confidential data by deception) </LI>

<P><LI>repudiation of a message sent earlier by the sender (for
example, the potential disowning of a negligent pathology
result). </LI>

</UL>

<P>However, there are a number of other threats that will not be
addressed by the use of network encryption, for example, the abuse of
access by authorised users. As has been said, these other threats are
being addressed separately by the NHS Executive, and they are not
dealt with within the scope of this report.


<H3>3.2 Communications Contexts</H3>


<P>The conclusion drawn from the study of communications contexts by C
International was that there is, or will be, a wide range of
information flows between a wide range of communicating entities where
unauthorised disclosure could, potentially, give rise to significant
and undesirable impacts

<P>Looking closer across the many dataflow contexts that need
securing, the characteristics of the sum total of the data flows are
that it:

<UL>

<P><LI>can involve almost all users, each communicating,
potentially. with many others </LI>

<P><LI>can touch almost any link of the NWN </LI>

<P><LI>will involve many systems, both national and local </LI>

<P><LI>will involve many different IT platforms, some of which will be
relatively new high-specification platforms but most of which will be
relatively low-specification platforms </LI>

<P><LI>will involve a variety of higher level communications
protocols. </LI>

</UL>

<P>Messaging (including E-mail) is the largest single type of NWN
communications context and is expected to remain so for some
time. However; other types of communication (file transfer;
interactive system access, tele-medicine) are significant and will
become more so with time. Many users are expected to access the NWN
via dial-up links. Hence, it is important that any solution adopted
should be capable of protecting these. The NWN will also be used for
broadcast traffic (though, by its nature, most of the broadcast
traffic will not be confidential), and it is important that any
solution adopted should be capable of protecting this. 

<P>Also, with time, it is expected that the development of more
sophisticated health care systems will lead to the exchange of more
comprehensive and, therefore, more sensitive clinical data over the
NWN. New applications of networking in the health environment are
already appearing which also bring further confidentiality demands,
for example remote consulting. This particular example would require
confidentiality protection of multiple synchronised channels, and
possibly of digital mobile radio channels, carrying voice and image as
well as data.

<P>From our study of the characteristics of the communications
contexts we derive the conclusion that if encryption is to be
effective in preventing eavesdropping and in preventing Outsiders not
equipped with the necessary technology and encryption keys from
communicating with networked systems, then it should be capable of
being made available at all endpoints in the network and in a form
capable of protecting any data transmitted to any other endpoint.

<P>What is required to achieve this is not so much a single encryption
product as a general encryption service based upon a family of
encryption products, a service which can be used to protect any type
of communication involving any pair or group of NWN network endpoints
The protection needed will be against eavesdropping and to prevent
anyone, either insiders or outsiders not equipped with the necessary
encryption facilities and keys, from communicating with networked
systems.

<P>The study of contexts also revealed a potential need for other
cryptographic services such as message integrity protection, source
authentication, and non- repudiation. For example:

<UL>

<P><LI>pathology/radiology test results (integrity protection and
source authentication) </LI>

<P><LI>referral details (source authentication) </LI>

<P><LI>items of service (source authentication and
non-repudiation). </LI>

</UL>

<P>However, confidentiality is seen to be the widest requirement. This
justifies the requested approach which was of focusing first on the
encryption solution and then examining ways by which the encryption
solution could be extended cost- effectively to support these
additional security services.

<P>It is worth remarking that the contexts studied place a range of
different performance requirements (in terms of response time and
throughput) on any cryptographic service. At one extreme, there are
pure massaging applications, for example the transmission of pathology
test results. A several second delay for cryptographic processing
would be unlikely to cause problems for the users. At the other
extreme is remote consulting where high bandwidth data streams would
need to be encrypted with minimal delay and in real time.

<P>The table below summarises this situation.

<H3>3.3 The IT environment</H3>


<P>Any technical solution intended to provide countermeasures to the
threats discussed above will have to be capable of working with the
variety of computer systems that are candidates for connection to the
NWN. Some important characteristics of these systems are:

<UL>

<P><LI>a wide variety of hardware and operating system platforms,
ranging through mainframe MVS systems, UNDC systems, VMS systems, more
unusual operating systems such as PICK, and of course PC-based systems
running under network operating systems such as Novell and Windows NT
as well as DOS and Windows </LI>

<P><LI>the continuing use of obsolescent hardware platforms such as
outdated PCs with limited processing power </LI>

<P><LI>application programs spanning a wide range of qualities of
design and of support. These include user written applications,
applications where the supplier has since gone out of business, and
applications where the design and documentation is so fragile or so
poorly understood that they cannot safely be modified. </LI>

</UL>

<P>Probably the most common computing environment found around the NWN
will be a PC running DOS or Windows. The cost of any encryption
facilities introduced will need to be modest or small in proportion to
the base cost of this common IT platform.



<A NAME="Recommended_approach"><P></A>
<H2>4 Recommended approach</H2>

<P>This section presents a summary of Zergo's recommended approach to
the provision of encryption facilities. Further supporting detail
describing the rationale behind the recommendations is presented in
Appendices B and C towards the end of this report.

<P>This section, and the remainder of this report, employ a number of
technical terms which may not be familiar to some readers. Appendix D
contains a glossary to assist the interested reader.


<H3>4.1 Introduction</H3>


<P>The study of the communications contexts has shown that there are
many cases where the value or sensitivity of the information exchanged
is sufficient that the use of encryption would be appropriate. This
judgement is based on an assessment of the magnitude of the possible
impact on one or more parties if confidential data were to be
disclosed.

<P>Adding encryption across the NWN as a whole has recently become
technically feasible. And, drawing on the wealth of experience
available from the Financial Services sector, the operation of
encryption across a wide and diverse user community (of many thousands
of users) has been shown to be manageable. It is not necessary for the
encryption facilities to be implemented everywhere at once. A planned
and phased implementation programme can be adopted with the benefits
of encryption beginning to flow from the start. The implementation
process will require care and effort, and the implementation programme
is expected to take several years to complete. A number of technical
and management issues will need to be addressed in the early
stages. For those users in need of encryption capabilities in the
short term, alternative interim options are available. These are
discussed at the end of this section.


<H3>4.2 Choice of Encryption Algorithm</H3>


<P>A number of encryption algorithms, public domain and proprietary,
exist. However, strong encryption algorithms and not available for
general use, and those algorithms which are available for general use
(for example, in the form of commercial off-the-shelf products) are
not regarded as adequately strong for the protection of Person
Identifiable Data. Consequently, the selection of a suitable
encryption algorithm is not, in this situation, straightforward.

<P>Given the national interest in the proper protection of Person
Identifiable Data, the advice of the National Technical Security
Authority, CESG, has been Sought on the choice of encryption
algorithm. CESG's advice is that, in the case of the NHS, there are
security benefits to be obtained from avoiding the use of encryption
algorithms which are in the public domain. CESG has recently been able
to make available to the NHS (and to others, including non-financial
sector Organisations) a suitable non-public domain algorithm known as
<I>Red Pike</I>. This encryption algorithm is very new, but there are
already a small number of products available on the market which use
it, and a wider range of products which use related algorithms and
which could quickly and simply be modified to use <I>Red Pike</I>
Consequently, the NHS need not fear that it might become locked in to
a single product or single supplier if it were to adopt <I>Red
Pike</I> as its preferred encryption algorithm.

<P>For the suppliers of encryption products, the NHS would represent a
large user community, and this size of potential market would
encourage the development of an active and competitive market in
<I>Red Pike</I> products. Also, the NHS is not alone in wanting to
encourage the development of an active Red Pike marketplace. Many
large international organisations outside the Financial Services
Sector are in need of similar encryption facilities. And, at the same
time, HMG has a number of initiatives currently underway which will
lead to the development of <I>Red Pike</I>-based systems. For example,
a CCTA-driven initiative to allow suppliers to government departments
to submit proposals electronically, and an Inland Revenue-driven
initiative to allow small businesses to file Tax returns
electronically. These organisations should add their weight to the
NHS's to encourage a wide range of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS)
products to be developed.


<H3>4.3 Technical Approach</H3>


<P>In light of the conclusions drawn from studying the many dataflow
contexts described in the previous section of this report, and in view
of the NHS's networking strategy, the NHS's network security strategy
should, in the large, favour providing the encryption facilities to
the host system whenever possible and, only if justified on a case by
case basis, provide it directly on the network itself.

<P>There are several advantages to be gained by providing the
encryption facilities to the host rather than the network:

<UL>

<P><LI>reusability of the security software - to allow the host's
local security facility to be used by more than one application if
needed </LI>

<P><LI>versatility of the security software - to allow the security
facility more easily to meet the varied needs of different systems or
contexts </LI>

<P><LI>independence of the security software from the networking
protocol (EDIFACT, SMTP, File Transfer, etc.) allowing the one
security facility to be used across more than one networking protocol,
and protecting the security facility from needing to be changed
whenever changes are made to the networking protocol </LI>

<P><LI>more cost-effective security - wherever multiple NWN links are
involved in the transmission of data between end-systems </LI>

<P><LI>increased security coverage - where it might facilitate
protecting sensitive data within some parts of end-systems prior to
its delivery to the NWN. </LI>

</UL>

<P>However, despite these benefits, in the early stages of the
implementation programme it may be appropriate to provide the
encryption predominantly in the lower levels of the networking
protocols in order to minimise some of the technical risks.

<P>Encryption facilities will be needed in a variety of forms
according to communications context and IT platform, and should be
provided in a range of forms to meet this need; there is no single
solution to meet all needs.

<P>The encryption facilities could be needed:

<UL>

<P><LI>most often implemented in software, but they may need to be
implemented in hardware in a few situations where performance criteria
mandate it (such as for the encryption of links between acute units
and the suppliers of their Facility Managed IT, or for high
throughput/short response time applications such as tele-medicine)
</LI>

<P><LI>in some cases as a Security API (a piece of service software
called directly by the business application, that delivers a standard
set of cryptographic functions through a highly structured standard
interface) for application systems or networking systems to call </LI>

<P><LI>in some cases built into the lower levels of the networking
infrastructure itself where it could, for example, intercept calls to
communications software so it could encrypt or decrypt the transmitted
data. Solutions of this kind would be needed where more complex
internal modifications to an existing application would not be
feasible, or where constrained by timing or migration issues. </LI>

</UL>

<P>The preferred form of implementation in any situation will vary
according to a number of considerations. The two considerations most
likely to influence the form of implementation are:

<UL>

<P><LI>the possible need for the encryption and key management
facilities to be built on to provide, in addition, Digital Signatures
for message protection, message source authentication and non
repudiation, and/or to support the strong authentication of people or
systems. These are the two most important needs after encryption, and
would usually favour an API-based approach to encryption </LI>

<P><LI>the need to avoid impacting the end-system for reasons of
urgency, reducing cost or reducing risk. This would usually favour a
network-level approach to encryption. </LI> </DL>

</UL>


<H3>4.4 Take-up of the encryption facilities</H3>


<P>In whichever of the above forms the encryption facilities are
implemented, it is expected that they will, on the whole, be
incorporated into the NWN on a system by system basis. Over a period
of time, increasing numbers of systems will be brought on stream using
encryption until all the systems that have a business case for using
encryption are so protected.

<P>The encryption facilities could, at the same time, also be
implemented in the form of a general purpose security package
independent of any one system or context, for example as a general
purpose message/file/data encryption package such as PGP (see Appendix
C), though PGP itself would not be appropriate to the NHS's needs<A
HREF="#BM1"><SUP>l</SUP></A>. If equipped with a suitable general
purpose package, the user would be able to use encryption or not
according to an explicit decision that they would make at the time as
to whether the traffic they were about to transmit warranted its use.

<P>Hence, there are a number of routes by which users might arrive at
the use of encryption, as follows:

<UL>

<P><LI>by default, because the use of encryption had been written into
the application </LI>

<P><LI>by choice, because in view of their judgement of the risks the
users requested the system provider to implement encryption with the
system, and they accepted the extra cost </LI>

<P><LI>each at their individual discretion, where they would have a
general purpose encryption utility such as a secure E-mad package and
they could decide on a case-by-case basis that a particular message
needed to be encrypted. </LI>

</UL>

<P>This approach means that: 

<UL>

<P><LI>for some applications, such as national applications, there
will need to be central policy defining where and how the encryption
facility is to be used </LI>

<P><LI>for other systems, there will need to be standards or guidance
developed to help the users determine if the cost of encryption is
warranted given the risks. As these will impact suppliers to the NHS,
the NHS Executive should have an interest in what standards or
guidance are provided. The NHS Executive may wish to co-ordinate and
drive the development of these standards or guidelines </LI>

<P><LI>for general use encryption packages, the users may wish to seek
guidance on when to use encryption and when not. </LI>

</UL>

<P>New applications will be able to incorporate the encryption
facilities they need, in the form that is most appropriate to them,
from the start within their design Hence, for each new system, the
cryptographic sub-system could be designed according to business and
technical needs, and in line with the applicable NHS cryptographic
Standards or guidelines. The use of NHS cryptographic standards will
channel the systems developers towards the reuse of a standard set of
cryptographic products.

<P>In the case of existing applications that might need to be upgraded to use encryption, it will be necessary for developers to incorporate the encryption facilities in to the existing system following the analysis of a business case comparing the perceived needs and expected costs. 



<H3>4.5 Trusted Third Parties</H3>


<P>With <I>Red Pike</I>, as with any symmetric encryption algorithm,
for two parties to be able to exchange encrypted traffic they need to
have a way to establish and manage the shared keys. Again, the advice
of CESG was sought about the possible need to interwork with any
future national key management infrastructure. CESG's advice was most
helpful and, while not leading to the introduction of any specific
functionality into the recommended NWN key management infrastructure,
has influenced the recommendations made in this report so that they
allow for this possibility.

<P>Given the size of the NHS community and the need for the simplest
of means for initialising the users' encryption facilities, the NHS
will need to develop a key management infrastructure which is built on
the use of what are known as asymmetric methods, and using one or more
Trusted Third Party (TTP) facilities. These TTPs would play a role in
the secure initialisation of the users' encryption facilities (they
could, for example, perform EDIFACT-style key notarisation) and in the
periodic changing of some of the users' keys. The TTPs would provide a
secure means by which users could obtain the appropriate high-level
cryptographic keys of other users to allow two parties ultimately to
exchange encrypted data. These high-level keys obtained from the TTPs
would not normally be the keys used to protect the exchanged data;
those keys would be generated and exchanged automatically and
bilaterally between the two communicating parties. Hence, the TTPs
themselves would not need to be involved in each exchange of encrypted
data. The TTPs would represent only a small overhead to the use of
encryption on the network and would add only a negligible amount of
additional network traffic.

<P>The TTPs would not require a large establishment for their daily
operation. TTP services could be provided by one or more external
service providers or by the NHS itself. As the keys being managed will
include end-system keys, not just network keys, the '17Ps should not
be provided by the NWN suppliers as part of the NWN service. Indeed,
the TTPs could be used to manage a wide range of cryptographic keys,
not just those associated with the use of these Red Pike encryption
facilities, and to provide associated services which are not
essentially cryptography based. For example, if there were the need, a
TTP could be used to provide a general Directory Service for the
NWN. The NHS will need to investigate the liability issues associated
with the operation of these TTPs (for example, any liabilities that
might arise from errors leading to the creation of a key certificate
for an unauthorised user), to determine whether there are any
constraints or limitations on the TT'P services being provided by
external suppliers or whether they would need to be provided by NHS
entities, and to determine for itself the services they could be
allowed to provide and the operational constraints and controls that
will be needed.


<H3>4.6 Key Management Infrastructure</H3>


<P>There are two options for the type of technology that could be used
for the key management infrastructure, RSA technology or
Diffie-Hellman (D-H) technology (see Appendix C for a description of
these terms and technologies). The technology that Zergo recommends
the NHS should use is the D-H technology. This will allow the NHS to
reserve its options regarding the possibility of interworking with any
future national key management infrastructure. It is highly likely
that any such national infrastructure would be based on D-H
technology. It is almost certain that it would not be based on RSA
technology. In all other significant aspects, including intrinsic
security strength, the two technologies are equivalent. Hence, a D-H
key management infrastructure is the more strategic of the two
available options.

<P>A D-H key management infrastructure would not preclude the use of
other algorithms, for example RSA, if that were needed for
interworking with other systems such as those in use in other European
countries. A D-H based infrastructure could easily be extended to
support DSA (a standard Digital Signature algorithm) based functions
which could then be used for the generation of suitable RSA (or, for
that matter, DSA) key certificates.

<P>The actual design of the NHS's key management infrastructure will
emerge in the early stages of the proposed pilot programme (see
Section 5.1). The first stage of the pilot will carry the main burden
of establishing the core key management infrastructure. Hence, the
design for this will need to be covered early in the pilot. Though it
would not be wise or appropriate to design the key management
infrastructure within this study, the expected general shape of the
infrastructure can already be sketched out (see <A
HREF="#Appendix_C">Appendix C</A>).


<H3>4.7 Short-Term or Interim solutions</H3>


<P>It is acknowledged that the strategic approach recommended in this
report will require some time to be piloted and implemented, and that
this would not provide all users with encryption capabilities in the
immediate term. For those users that have a more urgent need to use
encryption, other, interim options are available. These could be used
within the NWN on a case-by-case basis and would not inhibit or
interfere with the strategic developments as they come on
stream. However, they would not allow the users to interwork with the
strategic approach as it was increasingly implemented. They should,
therefore, be seen as interim steps for the short term, and it should
be expected that they would need to be replaced at some time in the
future when interoperability with other strategically protected
end-systems was required.

<P>Possibly the most attractive of the available short-term solutions
would be to use products such as E-mail packages that implement the
Red Pike algorithm. There is at least one such product available now,
and it is expected that more will follow. These will remain short-term
or non-strategic solutions, for the reasons discussed in Appendix C
Further investigation by the NHS is recommended before this class of
product can be endorsed.

<P>Other interim solutions are possible but have disadvantages, as follows. 

<UL>

<P><LI>the use of other available government algorithms. The National
Technical Security Authority, CESG, has a number of encryption
algorithms both hardware and software, one of which, Rambutan, (a
hardware chip) might be used where more sensitive information needs to
be protected and/or high bandwidth communications are required. A
small number of trusts have already investigated the possibility of
using Rambutan equipment for network protection. This algorithm is
available only within hardware devices, not in software, and is not
available to all NHS users as Red Pike will be, which is why it has
not been recommended here as part of the strategic approach. However,
its use could be suitable in some particular situations </LI>

<P><LI>the use of published and available algorithms. For example,
some users might wish to use the E-mail security package PGP. There
are a number of substantial reasons why PGP cannot be considered as a
strategic solution (see Appendix C and the earlier note in Section
4.4). PGP users would need to be aware of the shortcomings of this
package and would need to accept these and the associated risks if
they were to use it </LI>

<P><LI>the use of unpublished but available algorithms. Some users
might wish to use proprietary algorithms, for example RC4 which is
used in a number of Internet applications. These algorithms are either
not sufficiently widely available (being controlled by a single
vendor, or under other restrictions) or, if they are widely available,
are recognised to be of inadequate strength. The widely available form
of RC4 has been shown through published attacks to suffer from this
latter shortcoming. The users would need to be aware of these problems
and would need to accept the associated risks if they were to use such
algorithms. </LI>

</UL>


<P><A NAME="Implementation_issues"></A>
<H2>5 Implementation issues</H2>


<P>Adding encryption onto the NWN is technically feasible, the
encryption processes and encryption facilities could be managed, and a
planned and phased implementation approach would be needed. Adding
encryption across the network would not be a simple task, and it would
bring with it a number of technical and management issues that would
need to be addressed carefully, as well as bringing many
benefits. These are discussed here.


<H3>5.1 Management Issues</H3>

<OL>

<P><LI>For many not familiar with the subject, the issues relating to
the use of encryption and key management can seem complex and
obscure. The NHS will need to present its security decisions and
proposed encryption approach carefully when dealing with the many
stakeholders. These include primarily: </LI>

<UL>

<P><LI>clinicians and health care professionals </LI>

<P><LI>clinical professional organisations, such as the BMA </LI>

<P><LI>health care managers </LI>

<P><LI>end-system owners system and network service suppliers press
and public. </LI>

</UL>

<P>Each will have its own interests and legitimate concerns, and will
require specific attention from the NHS.

<P>Zergo believes that each stakeholder should be able to support the
recommended encryption approach. Significantly in the NHS's favour is
that, by using Red Pike, the NHS will (subject to independent
confirmation of the strength of the algorithm - see Section 5.2 below)
be using a stronger encryption algorithm than the Data Encryption
Standard (DES), an algorithm that has been used for over ten years
within the Banking sector. This should assure all concerned that the
NWN can be a suitably secure vehicle for the exchange of confidential
Person Identifiable Data. In addition, the NHS can demonstrate that it
has sought and taken expert advice from both HMG's security advisors
and from independent experts on the cryptographic tools it should
use. Zergo is confident that no significant criticism of the
cryptographic adequacy in today's environment of the NHS's current
encryption proposals should remain outstanding.

<P><LI>The implementation of encryption facilities across the NWN will
need to be taken carefully. The NHS will need to develop an
implementation strategy that includes a staged encryption pilot, and
carefully staged subsequent implementations, that takes full account
of the many management and technical issues involved. Migration to the
new cryptographically enabled versions of standard applications will
require particularly careful planning. </LI>

<P><LI>The NHS will need to decide which section within the IMG should
be responsible for managing the programme of implementing encryption
on the NWN. The whole implementation programme will be quite complex
to manage and will require a high level of senior management
commitment and support. </LI>

<P><LI>As has been mentioned, Red Pike is a non-published algorithm
supplied by CESG. CESG has made a number of significant national
policy decisions concerning the release and supply of Red Pike
encryption facilities for use by the NHS. When the pilot is being
defined, and in particular when the detailed key management design is
being developed (see below), there may be a few residual policy
decisions needing to be made by CESG. </LI>

<P><LI>The NHS may need to steer an intermediate course between
forbidding the use of the NWN for the transmission of certain types of
data in unencrypted form (which might be unacceptable to some users)
and leaving it to the users unaided to decide whether to use the
encryption tools that are offered. This latter option would require a
high level of security awareness from the users, and this is not
likely to be present generally across the user community. </LI>

<P>An Executive Board policy decision would be needed on the approach
to be adopted with respect to the take-up of encryption facilities
within NHS systems and the NWN. It will need to be decided where the
responsibilities should lie for deciding on the extent to which
encryption should be used, and on what would be considered suitable
timescales over which the take-up of encryption should occur. Then,
guidance will be needed for system owners to support them in complying
with the policy, and for system providers to help them interpret the
policy consistently. The NHS might wish to facilitate a forum of user
representatives and other interested parties which issues guidance to
the wider user community on the use of the encryption facilities with
the NWN. This presents the NHS management with an opportunity to take
the initiative on the setting and presentation of security issues and
standards. The guidance would need to be written in the context of the
current Data Networking Security Policy, Guidelines, and Codes of
Connection.

<P><LI>A strategy will need to be developed for supporting the
introduction of encryption facilities into new and existing
applications, as described below </LI>

<UL>

<P><LI>suppliers of existing MIS applications may need encouragement
to integrate cryptographic security into their systems - perhaps
through the existing Accreditation process </LI>

<P><LI>injecting requirements for added cryptographic security into
projects already running as Private Finance Initiatives may disturb
the underlying business case and thus be resisted by the developers,
or lead to a re-pricing of the service provided </LI>

<P><LI>the additional costs of implementing cryptographic security may
impair the business case for some systems which do not have the
prospect of a large customer base. It may never be cost effective to
migrate some legacy systems (older generation systems) or dumb systems
to incorporate cryptographic security. </LI>

</UL>

<P><LI>The legal, commercial and organisational issues surrounding the
creation of Trusted Third Parties will have to be investigated. These
will need to include. </LI>


<UL>

<P><LI>the Terms of Reference for establishing the TTPs </LI>

<P><LI>the need for or form of charging for the TTP's services </LI>

<P><LI>legal conditions under which TTPs will be able to release
information under their control or care </LI>

<P><LI>to whom TTPs will release each category of information </LI>

<P><LI>the liabilities that will fall to the operators of the TTP, to
the NHS centrally and to the NHS user in the event of a failure in the
TTP's controls </LI>

<P><LI>what kind of entity could be acceptable as a TTP, e.g.: </LI>

<UL>

<P><LI>NHS central organisation </LI>

<P><LI>A Trust </LI>

<P><LI>Specialist commercial security organisation </LI>

<P><LI>Government department </LI>

</UL>

</UL>

<P>The pilot will allow these TTP issues to be exercised and will help
the NHS to determine its long term position with regard to the
provision of TTP services. From these and related considerations, the
NHS will then be able to determine its requirements for controls on
the TTPs. The contracting of TTP services will then need to be framed
with attention being given to the relevant legislative frameworks as
they exist within English law.

</OL>

<H3>5.2 Technical Issues</H3>


<OL>

<P><LI>As <I>Red Pike</I>, the recommended encryption algorithm, is
not yet well known and as a consequence has not yet achieved wide
acceptance in the public domain it should be subject to independent
review by an expert who is acceptable to the commercial and public
domains as well as to the owners of the algorithm, CESG. The objective
of this will be to obtain authoritative assurance that no agency
external to the NHS could reasonably decrypt data which has been
encrypted by the NHS. This review will be an important part of the NHS
managing the presentation of its encryption approach. It will also
give the NHS confidence that its interests are being properly
represented by CESG when it advises on the use of <I>Red
Pike</I>. </LI>

<P><LI>The newness of <I>Red Pike</I> means that, though there are
already a number of suppliers that can provide <I>Red Pike</I>
cryptographic tools, there is currently only a limited range of
products available. However, given the size of the NHS market alone,
as the NHS makes these suppliers aware of its needs it can expect that
appropriate products will be developed to meet these needs. This need
for new product development will add to the technical risks of
developing NWN encryption. However, Zergo believes that the additional
risk will be slight given that <I>Red Pike</I> has been designed to
allow it to be used in conventional products as a simple replacement
for conventional encryption algorithms. </LI>

<P><LI>Some of the systems used by the NHS may also be marketed by
their suppliers for use in other countries in addition to the
UK. Suppliers will be looking for architectural solutions to adding
encryption to their products, which are capable of adaptation for use
in those countries. Solutions based on high-level APIs, International
Standards or de-facto standards, and modular cryptography, as
recommended here, will likely be more acceptable in these
situations. </LI>

<P><LI>Early in the development of the NWN encryption pilot it will be
necessary for the NHS to develop a detailed Key Management design for
the core of the key management infrastructure. This will be highly
specialised work requiring expert cryptographic assistance. Zergo
advises that the NHS should, at this stage, also seek further input
from CESG to confirm that the resultant scheme is of a sound
design. CESG is expected to be strongly supportive of the NHS's
development of a key management infrastructure and can be expected to
offer its assistance in this and various other stages of the pilot
development. </LI>

<P><LI>The NHS will need to define a set of technical standards for
cryptographic security to ensure both conformance with the agreed key
management arrangements and reliable and secure interworking between
applications. The standards will evolve as each of the pilot and
implementation stages is executed, and will cover topics such as the
frequency of key changes for each main class of application or device,
the need to use a new key with each message rather than to have static
message keys, and so forth. </LI>

<P><LI>There are a number of formal schemes which the NHS could use
for this evaluation process, and the most appropriate of these would
be the ITSEC/ITSEM scheme jointly administered by the DTI and CESG to
provide commerce / industry and government customers with assured IT
security products. (Although government high security projects have
been the main customers for this certification scheme, more general
acceptance by industry has been encouraged by a recent reciprocal
arrangement with Germany, whereby, to a certain level, each nation's
ITSEC certificates can be recognised by the other.) </LI>

<P>However, there are many drawbacks associated with the use of the
ITSEC/ITSEM scheme for software products, chiefly those of cost and
delay. Other options include the use of expert and independent system
testers but without using the formal ITSEC/ITSEM methodology, and the
use of the NHS's own IT resources. The NHS would need to evaluate
carefully whether to use the ITSEC/ITSEM scheme or one of the other
evaluation options.

<P><LI>The NHS will need to identify a small number of candidate
systems for use in the encryption pilot programme. The NHS-Wide
Clearing System (NWCS) may well be a suitable candidate for the first
stage of the pilot, and there is already in place a plan to pilot the
use of encryption with the NWCS. This NWCS encryption pilot is,
itself, having to address the same issues as have been addressed in
this study regarding the selection and use of cryptographic and key
management tools. Hence, it should not be disadvantaged by being used
as the first NWN encryption pilot. </LI>

<P>It will be desirable to have more than one system used within the
plot programme, in order to prove the feasibility of encryption across
the wide range of different systems. For example, it will be important
for one of the pilot systems to be one which involves GPs
directly. Consequently, the pilot should be a staged pilot with each
stage being of successive complexity.

<P><LI>CESG has not taken detailed performance measurements for <I>Red
Pike</I> as these would vary according to the application and platform
concerned. The NHS will need to obtain precise performance figures
applicable to the range of IT platforms that the user community is
expected to use, preferably before the design of the pilot is
commenced. However; having seen a description of the algorithm, Zergo
would expect that its performance will be acceptable and, indeed, has
the capability to outperform many existing encryption algorithms such
as DES. </LI>

<P><LI>The secure storage of secret cryptographic keys win have to be
addressed for each of the different types of end-site attached to the
NWN. In situations where all the cryptographic functions are
implemented in software to reduce cost, the storage of secret keys on
disk always brings some residual risk of disclosure or unauthorised
access to the keys, even when the keys are themselves stored encrypted
under some other key. An alternative way to protect the keys is to
store them on some kind of removable medium or token. It is expected
that, increasingly, NHS users will be using smart cards for system
access and then the user's keys could be stored on the smart card
itself instead of on the user's workstation. A number of other such
options can be identified. In all cases, it is important that, for any
system, its detailed design gives adequate consideration to the issue
of recovery from the loss of such a token. </LI>

</OL>

<P>Once the implementation has started and before it has completed
there will be a considerable period of time during which some but not
all of the end users will have been encryption enabled. This raises an
issue to do with managing the interworking between users and
applications where some will and others will not be equipped with
encryption facilities. The staged implementation programme where whole
systems are brought on-stream one at a time should minimise the size
of this issue. It may become necessary in some situations to allow the
user the discretion to determine whether or not a message should be
encrypted depending on whether the recipient is capable of decrypting
such a message. In practice, each situation will have to be examined
and appropriate choices will have to be made on a case-by-case basis.
</DL>


<H3>5.3 Costs</H3>

<H4>5.3.1 Introduction</H4>

<P>It is important that the whole life cycle costs of introducing encryption onto the NWN are considered, not just the purchase costs of the equipment. The life cycle costs include, along with the equipment purchase or licence costs. the manpower costs of: 

<UL>

<P><LI>planning and outline specification </LI>

<P><LI>procurement, design, development, testing and implementation of
the pilots </LI>

<P><LI>possible cost of earlier replacement of any systems not
suitable for upgrading to introduce encryption </LI>

<P><LI>running the pilots </LI>

<P><LI>updating the Accreditation Specifications </LI>

<P><LI>system migration and implementation </LI>

<P><LI>training </LI>

<P><LI>operation, maintenance and support </LI>

<P><LI>review and on-going enhancement. </LI>

</UL>


<P>Though much of the above project manpower could be provided by the
NHS from its own staff resources, there will be the need for the NHS
to obtain external assistance at a number of stages.

<P>Below, the general size of the possible lifecycle costs of
introducing encryption and other security services onto the NWN are
indicated, grouped separately into manpower and equipment costs. It
must be stressed that, for both groups, these costs are only
indicative and should be taken as broad planning estimates, not as
upper limits. The actual costs to the NHS will, of course, depend on
many parameters including the balance between the use of NHS staff and
outside assistance, the balance between hardware and software
implementations, and so forth. Whist it must be understood that the
costs are only indicative, every effort has been taken to ensure that
the costs given are reasonable and useful.



<H4>5.3.2 Costs Summary</H4>


<P>The day to day operation of the encryption facilities should be
essentially transparent to the users. For this reason, there will not
be the need for, and associated costs of, many thousands of users
being trained up before encryption can be used. Similarly, the day to
day operation of the TTP(S) will require only a small number of staff
and, consequently, will require only modest on-going resourcing. The
main manpower costs relate to the running of the pilot and subsequent
implementations. For these, the NHS will need to provide of order a
few tens of man-years of staff resource, some proportion of which
might be bought-in general project consultancy rather than provided
from internal staff. in addition to this, there is the potential,
overall, for of order £250,000 worth of external expert security
consultancy to assist in these programmes.

<P>We use two different global cost models to calculate the possible
equipment costs for introducing encryption throughout the NWN. The
purpose of these two models is to show the order of magnitude of the
equipment costs for two widely differing models with different
assumptions as to how the facilities would be implemented. These two
models should not be taken as giving upper and lower bounds to the
possible total costs. Indeed, the two results derived are still of the
same order of magnitude as each other. Hence, we can conclude that the
possible equipment costs for introducing encryption across the NWN
could well be in the range £15M to £20M. These would be spread
throughout the implementation programme which would last for several
years. At the end of this, the annual on-going costs could be in the
range £2.5M to £3M.

<H4>5.3.3 Manpower Costs</H4>


<P><EM>Planning and outline specification</EM><BR> The first step for
the NHS after accepting the report will be to develop a plan to carry
the strategy forward. This will include determining an outline
specification for the technical architecture, for which the NHS will
require some expert security consultancy assistance. Possible security
consultancy fees - at least £20,000.

<P><EM>Procurement, design, development, testing and implementation of the pilots</EM><BR>
The first stage of the pilot will carry the burden of establishing the
core of the key management infrastructure. Successive stages of the
pilot and subsequent implementations may enhance and build upon this
core infrastructure but will each carry a rapidly diminishing share of
the infrastructure development. For a modestly sized first stage
pilot, this part of the work may take of order nine to twelve months
to execute. For an extensive first pilot, it is likely to take
considerably longer. As well as the NHS staff involved, there will be
the need for a mix of external security assistance. Possible security
consultancy fees - £100,000. Successive stages of the pilot should
require a lower level of external security assistance, possibly
£50,000. 

<P><EM>Running the pilot</EM><BR> Each stage of the pilot should be
operated for at least six months, assuming it is successful. During
this time there will be phased evaluations to ensure that the results
of the pilot stage are taken on-board as they become available. This
task can be performed primarily with NHS staff.

<P><EM>Updating the Accreditation Specifications</EM><BR> At some
intermediate stage, the Accreditation Specifications for GP systems
will need to be amended to include the encryption facilities. The
changes to the specifications will need to be agreed with
representatives of the GP systems supplier community and signed off by
the NHS Executive. A period of time, at least a year, will then be
needed to allow the suppliers to respond to the changes. This task can
be performed primarily by NHS staff with some expert security
consultancy assistance. Possible security consultancy fees -
£20,000.

<P><EM>System Migration and Implementation</EM><BR> The cost of this
part of the programme is largely the cost of bringing each new system
in under the security umbrella. For each system there will be the
normal planning, design, development, testing and implementation
cycle, and this cost will vary widely according to the nature of the
system and the manner in which encryption is added. Different
approaches to covering the costs may well be appropriate for different
types of system:

<UL>

<P><LI>General Practice Systems </LI>

<P><LI>Acute Unit Systems </LI>

<P><LI>Community Systems </LI>

<P><LI>National NHS systems (NHS-wide Clearing Service, etc.). </LI>

</UL>

<P>and that will affect the distribution of the costs between
different funding sources. For each new system brought in, the normal
costing cycle will need to be followed, business cases developed and
procurement managed

<P>It can be expected that each system's implementation programme
would require a few man-years of NHS staff resources in
total. However, only a small part of this would be extra to the normal
implementation costs for the system and attributable directly to the
implementation of the encryption facilities. Hence, if encryption is
added in to a system's existing implementation programme, for example
either for a new system or for a revised one that is put back into
service following other system enhancements, the marginal extra
resources needed to manage the encryption aspects of the
implementation will be only a small part of the whole programmes
resourcing needs.

<P>The resourcing required for the development of the encryption
facilities by the system vendor will be borne by the NHS within the
equipment costs of the products purchased. For further guidance on
what these costs might be, see the equipment costs given below.

<P><EM>Training</EM><BR> The encryption facilities should operate with
a high degree of automation and the users should not need a high level
of training in their use. A degree of user security awareness training
could be beneficial but this would be general training and would not
need to be specific to the use of the encryption tools. Specific
training will be required for the operators of the TTP, and it is
assumed that this would be provided as part of the development of the
TTP (see below). Possible cost of training the TTP operators - at
least £20,000.

<P><EM>Operation, Maintenance and Support</EM><BR> The first TTP will
require a small team of staff to handle the initialisation of the
users' security facilities in whichever form they are implemented, and
for the periodic management of high-level cryptographic keys. The
lower-level keys will be managed automatically. The level of staffing
at the T'FP will depend on the rate at which users are brought
onboard, the need to operate dual-control over some of the more
sensitive TTP operations, and the need to provide cover for absence
(holidays and sickness). It is not expected that the TTP would need to
provide support out of normal daytime working hours; the period of
cover provided each day could be determined according to perceived
need. On this basis, a manning level of four to six staff is
suggested. During periods of active implementation, these staff may be
fully utilised; during steady-state operation of the TTP, they need be
only part-time utilised, allowing them to perform other tasks. It is
assumed that maintenance and support of the equipment (TTP and user
equipment) would be provided as part of the equipment purchase costs.

<P>Beyond the pilot, the NHS has two options for the development of
further TTP support. It could:<BR> <EM>either</EM>

<UL>

<P><LI>remain with a single 'ITP, having the pilot TTP be established
as the single management point for all NHS encryption-enabled systems,
taking each system under its cover as the encryption facilities are
increasingly widely implemented </LI>

</UL>

<P><EM>or</EM>

<UL>

<P><LI>decide to develop further TTPs as each stage of the
implementation progresses, with each TTP having a specific community
of users that it supported. </LI>

</UL>


<P>The strategy for the development of TTPs would evolve as the NHS
gained experience in their use. If only a single TTP were developed,
even once the encryption facilities were fully implemented across the
NWN, it should not be necessary for there to be a sizeable number of
staff performing central administration tasks. If multiple TTPs were
developed, the accumulated TTP staffing would be higher owing to the
reduction in the economies of scale achieved. However, each TTP would
likely have only a small staffing requirement, with the minimum number
of staff being four, and these might be involved only part time in
performing TTP functions. In either situation, the full time
equivalent staffing level for the 7rP functions should be no higher
than, say, eight staff.


<P><EM>Review and On-going Enhancement</EM> There will be the need to
monitor the performance of the encryption infrastructure and there
may, periodically, be the need for its enhancement. These will become
apparent as the use of encryption advances within the NHS and cannot
be predicted. They will fit within the normal cycle of infrastructure
development.



<H4>5.3.4 Equipment Costs</H4>


<P>The equipment needed will include the equipment in the TTP and
end-system encryption equipment, and the latter will vary according to
the manner of the various implementations. It is not possible for this
report to provide a definitive overall cost for implementing
encryption on the NWN because there is a wide range of parameters
which will influence each implementation and which cannot be
determined at this stage. The overall cost will vary according to the
balance of hardware versus software implementation, the number and
variety of systems running on large or midrange hosts, the allocation
of development risk between the NHS and suppliers, and so forth. Also,
the distribution of costs between the various funding sources will
vary to some degree depending on the financing approaches used.

<P>Consequently, the approach we have adopted is as follows. We begin
by presenting typical indicative costs (both one-off costs and
on-going annual costs) for some of the main components that are likely
to be needed somewhere within the NWN. We then, in the following
subsection, use these to derive broad indicative costs for adding
encryption to the NWN for a number of general user examples. Finally,
we derive broad indicative costs for the NWN as a whole using to
Global Cost (GC) models based on broad global assumptions.

<H5>5.3.4.3 Total Cost to the NHS</H5>


<P>The total cost of implementing the recommended encryption approach
is obviously an important parameter. This cost will depend on a large
number of imponderables, for example the outcome of discussions with
suppliers about the feasibility and cost of adding software-based
encryption facilities to their products.

<P>In view of imponderables of this nature, costing based on detailed
analysis of systems would require a large number of assumptions and
could not be accurate to better than an order of magnitude. We have,
therefore, here, derived costs based on two grossly simplified models
representing two extremes of implementation, in order to show the
range of costs that might be experienced. All the costs are based on
current values and make no allowance for inflation or for
depreciation.

<P>There will also be a requirement for a few tens of man years of NHS
internal resource (some of which may be provided by external
agencies).

<P>Information about the above systems is not complete. Details about
the number of different systems used within the NHS and the number of
major versions of these systems will need to be reviewed. For purposes
of high-level costing, it is assumed here that there are four versions
or types of each of the above systems. <A NAME="Benefits"></A>


<H2>6 Benefits</H2>


<P>Each stakeholder will obtain some benefits from the use of
encryption on the NWN, though these may well be different for
different stakeholders.

<P><I>Patients</I><BR>
Patients will benefit from the actual increase in security on the N~, and the level of benefit will increase in time with the degree of implementation achieved. As Person Identifiable Data exchanged over the network is increasingly protected, the risk to the patient of its disclosure and the possibility of embarrassment or consequential financial penalty, will fall. Patients will also benefit from having increased confidence in the practices of the MIS, and from the increased quality of service provided by the healthcare prnfess1.ons that will come with the increased automation and networking of MIS systems enabled by NWN encryption. 

<P><I>Clinicians and health care professionals</I><BR> These will benefit
from being able to make wider use of the NWN so that they achieve a
reduction in bureaucracy and give better service to their
clients. Lack of encryption may have been a barrier to this in the
past, and this need no longer be the case with the introduction of
encryption-enabled systems. The level of benefit will increase with
the extent of the implementation of the encryption facilities.

<P>To the degree that the encryption facilities are used to provide
services other than network encryption, the clinicians and health care
professionals would be able to protect confidential information in
their care against other threats. For example, the use of encryption
to protect data stored on PCs or hand-held equipment would protect the
data from disclosure if the equipment were lost stolen.

<P><I>Health Care Managers</I><BR> Health Care Managers are
responsible for the end-systems and are, amongst other things,
responsible for ensuring that their systems are adequately secure for
the purposes to which they are to be used. To the degree that their
systems are exposed to networking security risks and these risks are
not otherwise covered by other countermeasures, the addition of
encryption to the NWN will provide them with an effective ~d to manage
those risks. Encryption could be added in a way that was responsive to
the business need and technical environment. They will then be able to
direct their attention to addressing the other non-networking security
risks to their end-systems, and to fulfilling their responsibility to
manage the full profile of risks faced by their systems. Health care
managers will also benefit from being able to develop systems and
automate processes that could not have been developed or automated
without the improved security facilities that would now become
available.

<P><I>The Data Protection Registrar</I><BR> The DPR will wish to be
assured that Person Identifiable Data is protected when transmitted
across the NWN. Neither the current Data Protection legislation nor
the recently agreed EU Data Protection Directive mandates the use of
encryption; that is a matter of national interpretation. However, it
should be expected with confidence that the DPR would be pleased to
see that personal data was encrypted on the NWN. <!---->



<H3>The NHS Executive</H3>


<P>The NHS Executive would benefit in a number of ways from the
introduction of encryption on the NWN.

<OL>

<P><LI>Overall, the level of security risk faced by MIS systems will
be reduced as network security disclosure risks are reduced. </LI>

<P><LI>The provision of encryption will encourage the wider use of the
NWN for mainstream applications. Hence, encryption will allow the NHS
to realise more fully the considerable benefits associated with the
NWN. Also, having the encryption and related capabilities in place
will be an important enabler of future IT initiatives allowing new
systems opportunities to be realised. </LI>

<P><LI>The API approach to encryption proposed as pan of the
recommended approach can easily be extended to provide the
functionality needed to deliver message integrity protection, user
authentication and message source authentication. Encryption in a
variety of forms can also be used to support the stronger enforcement
of access control across systems, though care must be taken to ensure
that it does not interfere with or run across the desired access
control systems. Consequently, the strategic approach provides the MIS
with a highly cost-effective manner of addressing these further
security concerns. </LI>

<P><LI>Depending on the particular form of their implementation, some
of the technologies proposed to satisfy the need for encryption on the
NWN can be used to address security needs which exist outside the NWN,
including the encryption of data transmitted over other networks such
as local LANs, the encryption of data stored on hard disks, the
management of cryptographic keys for non-NWN systems, and so
forth. Consequently, again, the strategic approach provides the NHS
with a highly cost-effective manner of addressing these further
security concerns. </LI>

<P><LI>Though the study here has focused on the protection of Person
Identifiable Data, there is nothing in the technology or approach
recommended that restricts its use to this type of data. The
encryption and related facilities could be used to protect any
sensitive data exchanged across the NWN including contracting and
management data. </LI>

<P><LI>The result of following CESG's advice in the choice of
encryption algorithm is that (subject to independent confirmation of
the algorithm's Strength - see Section 5.2 above) the level of
security provided on the NWN will be higher than that in many
conventional Banking systems. This wilt help the NHS to counter any
criticism of the NWN's security approach in so far as confidentiality
is concerned. </LI>

</OL>


<A NAME="Implementation"><P></A>
<H2>7 Implementation</H2>

<P>It is envisaged that many of the actions outlined below would be
managed and carried out by the NHS Information Management Group,
calling on assistance from external consultants as required. Owners of
the applications may have to play a part in negotiating with
application suppliers regarding the addition of encryption facilities,
particularly if suppliers are not willing to carry the full
development risk of the modifications themselves. The procurement
strategy will need to pay attention to this possibility and aim to
avoid it where possible.


<H3>7.1 Preliminary Confirmations</H3>


<P>A number of preliminary steps will be required to establish a firm
direction for subsequent work. It is estimated that these will take in
the order of three months to complete.

<OL>

<P><LI>The NHS will need to have further, more detailed discussions
with CESG to: </LI>

<UL>

<P><LI>understand the details underpinning CESG's position regarding
the use of encryption in the NWN, to air any particular concerns
regarding, for example, the availability of Red Pike to non-LTK
systems providers, the possibility of the NHS being allowed to use
alternative algorithms, expectations regarding a possible national key
management infrastructure, and so forth </LI>

<P><LI>agree on any outstanding policy decisions that CESG may need to
make </LI>

<P><LI>determine what assistance CESG may be able to provide to the
NHS as it puts its encryption strategy into practice. </LI>

</UL>

<P><LI>The NHS will need to confirm the cryptographic strength of Red
Pike by obtaining an independent expert view. CESG has already
indicated its willingness to allow such a review, and the precise
Terms of Reference for the review will need to be agreed with
them. </LI>

<P><LI>The NHS should seek legal advice on the possible implications
of the legislative framework as far as this might affect its use of
TTPs, </LI>

<P><LI>Investigate the extent of any support or assistance that might
be available from other government departments, for example from the
DTI, to assist in the development of parts of the key management
infrastructure. </LI>

</OL>



<H3>7.2 Planning and Outline Specification</H3>


<P>Following the satisfactory completion of the preliminary
confirmations, the NHS will be able to advance into the planning of
its implementation strategy. It will need to.

<UL>

<P><LI>Confirm its strategy for cryptographic algorithms and key
management in the light of the results of the above steps. </LI>

<P><LI>Decide, what controls it might wish to have put on access to
keys held at the TTPs. </LI>

<P><LI>Build a Project Strategy that covers staged piloting and staged
implementation. Decide on the pilot projects and determine whether to
use the Clearing Service for the first stage of the pilot. Decide on
an initial outline implementation programme. This can carry
implications regarding the preferred order of priority for protecting
NHS systems using the NWN. Obtain an Executive Board decision on the
approach to be adopted with respect to the take-up of encryption
facilities within NHS systems and the NWN, and on what would be
considered suitable timescales over which the take-up should
occur. </LI>

</UL>

<H3>7.3 The Pilot Programme</H3>


<P>A multi-stage pilot programme may be needed before major
implementation is attempted. The initial tasks within this programme
will involve specification and development work before pilot testing
can begin. It is estimated that the first stage of the pilot would
take between a year and is months to complete. The successive
overlapping stages of the pilot could each take nine to twelve months
to complete.

<P>Major steps within the first stage of the pilot would include. 


<OL>

<P><LI>Arrange for the necessary budget provisions for the Pilot
programme to be made. </LI>

<P><LI>Identify the objectives of the piloting exercise and from the
results identify suitable applications and areas of the network for
involvement within the Pilot. It wilt be necessary to strike a balance
between choosing applications and areas which are representative of
the main problems which will be encountered in frill implementation,
and ensuring that the pilot remains manageable. Consequently, there
may be a need for more than one pilot stage, each successive one of
increasing technical complexity </LI>

<P><LI>Develop an overall plan for the pilot programme. </LI>

<P><LI>The preparation of a number of technical standards and
specifications will be needed. wherever possible, these should be
based on existing standards. The following will be
required. </LI>

<UL>

<P><LI>key management standards </LI>

<P><LI>specification for the key management systems at a trusted third
party depending on the nature of the pilot implementation, the
following may be required </LI>

<P><LI>standards for cryptographically protected exchanges in the NWN
</LI>

<P><LI>an API specification for a standard cryptographic software
architecture tool lit </LI>

<P><LI>for each application involved in the pilot, a specification for
adding the cryptographic capabilities. </LI>

</UL>

<P><LI>Agree a contractual basis for the participation of both
suppliers and users in each stage of the pilot. </LI>

<P><LI>Ensure the availability of appropriate types of cryptographic
software and hardware products that might be required. </LI>

<P><LI>Develop the first stages of the key management infrastructure
as necessary for the first stage of the pilot. </LI>

<P><LI>Design, develop, implement and test any modifications necessary
to enable each of the applications and systems involved in the pilot
to make use of encryption. </LI>

<P><LI>Carry out a security awareness programme for the users
including any specific guidance necessary for users to understand and
use the cryptographic facilities provided under the first pilot
project. Develop the training needed for the operators and management
of the pilot 1Tp. </LI>

<P><LI>Implement and run the first stage of the pilot. </LI>

<P><LI>Carry out a preliminary evaluation of the results of the pilot
at the earliest feasible milestone. Use these results to plan any
changes to the remainder of the first stage pilot programme. </LI>

<P><LI>Carry out a full evaluation at the end of the planned pilot
programme and adapt the plans for successive pilot stages and the
preliminary planning for full implementation, as needed in the light
of the results. </LI>

</OL>


<H3>7.4 Main Implementation Process</H3>


<P>Agreement will need to be reached with the early adopters of
encryption regarding the relative implementation priorities to be
given to each of their systems. These priorities will be drawn up on
the basis of commercial, practical and security risk considerations as
well as in the light of the pilot results. If the results of the plot
show that few modifications to the plot technology (user, system or
TTP technologies) are required for the initial phases of
implementation, then the implementation process could begin almost
immediately after the completion of the first stage of the plot. The
priority phases of implementation would probably take at least two
years.

<P>Steps to consider in the implementation process would include: 

<OL>

<P><LI>Define any necessary criteria for agreeing priorities for
implementing encryption in systems. </LI>

<P><LI>For each system, ensure that reasonable care has been taken by
the system owner to make adequate budgetary provision for the security
elements, including planning for the implementation and testing of the
encryption processes. </LI>

<P><LI>Update and extend as needed the specifications produced at the
start of the pilot programme. Produce any additional specifications
needed for types of system not included in the pilot. </LI>

<P><LI>Develop and test any new technical features needed for the TTPs
or key management infrastructure as implementation progresses. </LI>

<P><LI>Carry out further user security awareness programmes including
any specific guidance necessary for users to understand and use the
cryptographic facilities being implemented. </LI>

</OL>

<H2>Appendix A - Terms of Reference from the NHS Executive</H2>

<P>The Terms of Reference for the study, provided by the NHS Executive
are given below.

<P><STRONG>The use of Digital Signatures and Encryption in the context
of NHS-wide Networking</STRONG>

<OL>

<P><LI>NHS-wide networking is intended to enable 'any-to-any'
communications for NHS users in pursuit of their legitimate NHS
business. Much of this communication will be administrative, financial
or statistical information but increasingly it will include clinical
information about patients such as referral and discharge letters,
laboratory requests and results, and contract Minimum data sets. </LI>

<P><LI>In order to ensure that the network architecture is appropriate
to future needs a study is required which explores the practical

<UL>

<P><LI>Digital Signatures to provide strong authentication and

<P><LI>Trusted Third Party facilities for certifying encryption keys
</LI>

<P><LI>Encryption for confidentiality </LI>

</UL>

</LI>

<P><LI>the additional costs and implications of providing these services on a national NHS basis in such a fashion that they are available for use when those communicating NHS information think it appropriate. </LI>

<P><LI>The study requires sound and up-to-date understandings of the
NHS and the relevant technologies. These are unlikely to be found in
one person. The study team will need to include people with the
highest level of expertise in each of these fields. The following

<P><LI>the complexities of key management in a very large organisation
where there is a great deal of autonomy in its constituent

</OL>

<P>Proposals are invited for carrying out this study. An early start
is essential, but the completion date will be determined in the light
of chosen study proposals.



<A NAME="Appendix_B"><P></A>
<H2>Appendix B - An outline architecture</H2>

<OL>

<P><LI>Encryption can be applied to the NWN in any of several ways. It
can be applied: </LI>

<UL>

<P><LI>on a link-by-link basis (e.g. GP system to NWN Point of
Presence (POP), NWN Pop to NWN switch, between NWN switches, NWN
switch to Acute system; in hardware or software) as illustrated in
Figure 1 </LI>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="figure1.gif" WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=172 BORDER=0 ALT="Figure 1"></CENTER>
<P>

<P><LI>or on an end-to-end basis as illustrated in Figure 2. </LI>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="figure2.gif" WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=174 BORDER=0 ALT="Figure 2"></CENTER>
<P>

</UL>

<P>There are two principal ways in which end-to-end encryption can be
provided:

<UL>

<P><LI>within the networking infrastructure (e.g., within the TCP,
X.25 or Frame Relay communications protocol; in hardware or software)
as illustrated in Figure 3 </LI>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="figure3.gif" WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=254 BORDER=0 ALT="Figure 3"></CENTER>
<P>

<P><LI>or at the application level (e.g., GP system to Acute system)
where it can either be built in to the application itself or called by
the network service (e.g. the User Agent in a massaging system) (in
software, possibly with hardware to assist the performance) as
illustrated in Figure 4 </LI>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="figure4.gif" WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=241 BORDER=0 ALT="Figure 4"></CENTER>
<P>

</UL>

<P>The preferred strategy must be to favour providing the encryption
facilities to the networked application whenever possible, and only
where needed on a case by case basis to provide it directly on the
network itself. There are several advantages to be gained by this:

<UL>

<P><LI>reusability of the security software - to allow the security
facility to be used by more than one application if needed </LI>

<P><LI>Versatility of the security software - to allow the security
facility more easily to meet the varied needs of different contexts
</LI>

<P><LI>independence of the security code - from the networking
protocol (EDIFACT, SMTP, File Transfer, etc.) </LI>

<P><LI>information would not be available in readable plain language
at intermediate switching points </LI>

<P><LI>more cost-effective security - where multiple NWN links are
involved </LI>

<P><LI>increased security coverage - where it might be possible to
protect the sensitive data within some parts of the end-system prior
to its delivery to the NWN. For example this strategy might provide
protection against eavesdropping in LAN systems. </LI>

</UL>

<P><LI>Encryption can either be carried out in physically separate
hardware units or it can be carried out by software running on end
systems e.g. GP System, PAS, Pathology system, Messaging user
agent. Hardware solutions are generally more expensive than software
solutions, and can bring associated problems of the control of
shipments (under government regulations controlling the export of
strong encryption algorithms). On the other hand, hardware will
generally deliver better throughput performance than
software. </LI>

<P>Many applications in the NWN are of the massaging or file transfer
type so that throughput is not a prime consideration. Cost is of
importance, particularly at the GP end. Consequently, the software
solution will often be the most appropriate. Having said that, there
may well be some situations where hardware may still be appropriate,
for example:

<UL>

<P><LI>remote diagnosis systems (teleconsulting), where the time
available for encrypting/decrypting an image may be severely limited
(here an alternative implementation might be software with hardware
assistance) </LI>

<P><LI>where an NWN link is replacing a leased line (e.g. Kilostream
or Megastream) carrying legacy system traffic, e.g. acute unit to FM
supplier link. Here simplicity is likely to dictate an implementation
in stand-alone 'black box" encryptors or an encrypting communications
card or modem </LI>

<P><LI>Router to Router links between local members of a natural
community (likely to be implemented with stand-alone 'black box'
encryptors), </LI>

</UL>

<P><LI>Software encryption solutions can be chosen to operate at a
variety of levels of the protocol stack. It can be argued that by
positioning the encryption function high in the stack, encryption
becomes independent of the functionality in the lower layers. This
would make it possible to change the underlying communications
protocol without affecting the encryption function, and avoid the need
to decrypt and re-encrypt when passing the transmitted data through a
gateway which changes the communications protocol. However, it is
likely that there will be some situations where the application is not
amenable to this. For example, a legacy system for which there is no
longer a business case for its being changed, or for which the
necessary programming and support skills are no longer readily
available. In these situations, there can be case-by-case advantages
to putting the encryption facility in the lower levels of the protocol
stack. This may arise more often in the early days of the
implementation programme and for legacy systems, less often as time
progresses. </LI>

<P>For any system, the preferred form of implementation will need to
be determined by an analysis of the options and constraints. There
should be no system or platform for which, if encryption or related
services are required, it would not be possible to find a feasible
implementation. Hence, encryption in one or other of the forms
mentioned above should be feasible for mainframe or midrange host
systems, client/server and PC-based systems, massaging and interactive
systems, and so forth. It is believed that there are a considerable
number of systems within the NHS which have been developed using
MLTMPS. MUMPS contains its own communications handlers and it has been
suggested that these cannot readily be adapted to call encryption
routines. If this is confirmed by further technical analysis, MUMPS
systems may find they are not able to use the network-level security
software option. In this case, they would be constrained to use other
options, either application-level (Security API) software or
network-attached (hardware) line encryption devices.

<P><LI>To allow interoperability between different implementations,
software encryption must conform to a defined set of standards. There
is a need to avoid the requirement for every application developer to
become an expert in programming cryptography. These two considerations
lead to the concept of defining a standard set of cryptographic
software tools which present a standard Security Application
Programming Interface (Security API). In a client/server environment,
these tools may be provided by a separate cryptographic server. </LI>

<P><LI>De facto standards are emerging for such Security APIs (for
example, the GSS- API - the Generic Security Services API). Most
security product suppliers are already working with these types of
standards. Variations in the software used to support these Security
APIs will be required to port the Security API across different
operating system platforms: e.g. LTNIX, PC Windows, MVS. </LI>

<P><LI>Consequently, it is likely that different systems will favour
different forms of implementation of the encryption facilities, and
these should, therefore, be provided in a variety of forms according
to context - there will be no single solution to meet all needs. The
NHS should expect to use: </LI>

<UL>

<P><LI>mostly software, but there may be a need for a small amount of
hardware </LI>

<P><LI>in the short term, mostly software low in the communications
stack to minimise the impact on the end-systems and the associated
technical risks </LI>

<P><LI>in the longer term, mostly Security API software called by
application systems or networking systems, though retaining some
instances where encryption is built into the lower levels of the
networking infrastructure. </LI>

</UL>

<P><LI>Where the Security API approach is selected, suppliers of
applications may then have to modify their applications to make
appropriate calls to Security API functions to encrypt traffic routed
over the NWN. </LI>

<P><LI>New applications will be able to incorporate the requisite
encryption facilities from the start within their design. Existing
applications will need to judge the business case for adding in the
security facilities. The API approach would often minimise the cost
and effort of introducing encryption, and this would be a major
benefit to that approach. But there may be cases where the developer
does not believe a business case exists. </LI></OL>


<A NAME="Appendix_C"><P></A>
<H2>Appendix C - Algorithms and key management</H2>

<P>This appendix describes the process by which the study has arrived
at its recommendations regarding the encryption algorithm and key
management infrastructure that should be used. We do not attempt in
this report to provide the user with an introduction to the use of
cryptography or to the measurement of its capabilities. There are a
number of available texts and reference sources which make the subject
accessible to the interested reader and which should be available in
any good sized technical library.

<P>Two entities exchanging encrypted data across the NWN will need to
share common cryptographic keys whilst ensuring that the keys used for
decrypting data are kept secret. The mechanisms for exchanging these
keys securely must, as far as possible, be invisible to the users of
the systems involved.

<OL>

<P><LI>For data encryption, the NHS will need to use symmetric rather
than asymmetric algorithms. This is to provide acceptable performance
in software implementations, and compactness of code. Symmetric
algorithms can also be used to provide message and data integrity
protection, and source authentication, and can be used in strong
methods of user authentication, but not for generating Digital
Signatures. </LI>

<P><LI>Conventional symmetric algorithms that are in the public
domain, for example, RC4 (40 bit equivalent key length - often found
in Internet security products) or D~ (56 bit equivalent key length -
widely used throughout the Banking sector), would not be adequate to
the NHS's needs. There are no stronger symmetric algorithms in the
public domain which are not restricted in one way or another (by
patent or by other controls) and which would, therefore, be available
for use throughout the NHS. </LI>

<P><LI>The published E-mail security package PGP would not be suitable
as a strategic solution to satisfy the requirement for NWN
encryption. </LI>

<UL>

<P><LI>PGP is designed for the one way messaging environment and could
not be used for interactive communications </LI>

<P><LI>PGP uses an algorithm which is patent controlled (the IDEA
algorithm for which the patent is held by a Swiss company
ASCOM). Hence, the NHS would be tied to a single algorithm supplier
which was both a commercial organisation and non-UK based </LI>

<P><LI>PGP is available either unsupported as freeware or as a
commercial version from a single supplier. Neither option would be
attractive strategically to the NHS </LI>

<P><LI>PGP does not define a mechanism for the convenient distribution
of encryption keys. This would severely limit its suitability for such
a large community as the MIS. It is also, for this reason, vulnerable
to 'man in the middle" attacks in which an attacker arranges for a
sender of information to be provided with his public key in place of
the public key of the intended destination of the information. The
attacker is then able to decrypt the information and send it on to the
true destination using the correct public key. </LI>

<P>This problem can be overcome with the use of a Trusted Third Party (TTP), and, indeed, a TTP is required for the proposed solution. However; this means that PGP could not be used as a strategic solution in its current form. Its wide scale use would require the modification of the package by the supplier to include interfaces to a TTP infrastructure 

<P><LI>PGP does not integrate well with standard office e-mail
packages. For the non-technical user, PGP would require the
development of a front-end to dc-skill its user interface. Again, this
means that PGP could not be used as a strategic solution in its
current form </LI>

</UL>

<P><LI>CESG has also advised that there are significant security
advantages to using unpublished algorithms rather than published
algorithms. However, unpublished algorithms will be either
proprietary, unaccepted by the cryptographic community, or strictly
controlled by the governments that have developed them. Any one of
these would make the algorithm either unacceptable or unavailable to
the NHS. </LI>

<P>The NHS is, therefore, in the constrained position of needing to
use an encryption algorithm that is sufficiently strong for its
protection needs but which can also be made available across the NHS
as a whole and to the NHS's many systems suppliers. Until recently, no
such algorithm existed to be used by the NHS. However, within the last
12 months, this situation has changed. CESG has responded to this
situation, which the NHS shares with many other large organisations
outside the government or Financial Services sectors, by developing an
algorithm known as <I>Red Pike</I>. The recommendation from CESG, and
supported by Zergo, would be that the NHS should use this algorithm to
meet its data encryption needs.

<P><I>Red Pike</I> has been released only recently and a number of
necessary National Policy decisions were made by CESG in the last
months of 1995 relating to its distribution and use. <I>Red Pike</I>
can be implemented in software as well as in hardware, and in a number
of forms to facilitate its use with a variety of systems and on a
variety of platforms. There are no standards covering the use of
<I>Red Pike</I>. However; <I>Red Pike</I> has been designed to share a
number of characteristics with DFS, for which there are many public
standards. Hence <I>Red Pike</I> could easily be used in accordance
with those standards. And <I>Red Pike</I> can be released in
appropriate forms to the NHS's suppliers, including those that are not
solely UK-based.

<P><LI>Whenever a cryptographic algorithm is used for data encryption,
one or more encryption keys will need to be exchanged or agreed
between the two parties (the sender and the receiver) so that only the
authorised receiver is able to decrypt traffic encrypted by the
sender. This process is known as Key Management. </LI>

<P>Among the users of the NHS-wide networking system, there will be
many users of encryption and, for each user, potentially many other
users for which it will require new or unique keys to ensure secure
communication. Hence, for many of the users, and certainly when
looking across the NHS community as a whole, there will be many keys
to be managed. For this reason of very large scale, it will be
essential for the NHS to have a Key Management infrastructure that
includes the use of asymmetric key management methods.

<P>This would exclude the use by the NHS of the most long-standing
and, therefore, widely used key management standards (for example, the
ANSI X9.17 standard). However, asymmetric key management methods have
been used and well proved in large networks (many thousands of users)
in the last five years, and suitable international standards are now
in existence for these.

<P><LI>There are two acceptable techniques for the asymmetric key
management of symmetric keys. These involve the use of RSA or
Diffie-Hellman (D-H) methods. Each technique could be used to provide
an acceptably secure Key Management infrastructure. Each would lead to
the use of one or more TTPs in a hierarchy if needed. Each could
support the use of hashing, and of asymmetric Digital Signature
techniques (using the RSA or DSA<A HREF="#BM3">3</A> algorithms
respectively). </LI>

<P><LI>HMG has, for a number of years, been developing its ideas for a
national Public Key Management Infrastructure having what is known as
Key Recovery (KR) capabilities. HMG's interest in Key Recovery is
driven by its Law Enforcement needs. Papers describing schemes with
this capability are now in the public domain for review and
comment. It is expected that eventual national policy in this area,
supported by legislation, will involve the use of KR capabilities
shaped closely along the lines indicated by current papers. </LI>

<P>It is strongly expected that the LTK national scheme will be built
around the use of D-H techniques. it is even more certain that the UK
national scheme will not be built on the use of RSA
techniques. Consequently, the advice from CESG, supported by Zergo,
would be that the NHS should develop a Key Management infrastructure
that uses D-H rather than RSA techniques.

<P><LI>The NHS should consider, when it designs the details of its key
management infrastructure, whether it wishes to implement the KR
capability within it or not. For example, the NHS should determine
whether it would be necessary for the NHS itself, under suitable
controls, to have the ability to decrypt selected traffic in order to
check that the encryption capabilities it provides to the end users
are not being misused for criminal or fraudulent ends. The NHS would
also need to ensure that the key management infrastructure it
developed was resilient in the event of the failure of a piece of
equipment storing encryption keys. This resilience could be provided
in a number of ways, one of which could be through the use of a KR
capability. </LI>

<P>The NHS could reserve its options in this regard by following a two
stage strategy: it could develop a first stage infrastructure which
used D-H without the KR capability; to be extended in a second stage
when or if desirable to include the KR capability. The first stage
might be needed only for the pilot. Alternatively, if the NHS so
wished, the first stage could be used all the way through nation-wide
implementation. It must be realised that, if the KR capability were to
be introduced, it would lead to very tight operational controls being
needed at the TTPs.

<P><LI>The D-H functionality (with or without KR capability) will
allow two networked end-systems to agree a symmetric key for bilateral
use. This key may be used as the <I>Red Pike</I> key for message
encryption. Alternatively, it might better be used to protect (by
encryption) a second <I>Red Pike</I> key, that key then being
exchanged between the two end-systems and being the one used for
message encryption. </LI>

<P>This use of encryption keys to encrypt other encryption keys is a
well established Key Management technique and can be used to allow the
frequent and automatic changing of message keys without the overhead
of renewing frequently the higher4evel D-H keys. Indeed, it is not
unusual to have a multi-layered hierarchy of Symmetric keys allowing
the key at the top of the hierarchy to be changed only rarely whilst
the keys at the bottom of the hierarchy can be changed automatically
with each and every message. The NHS should build in to its Key
Management infrastructure the flexibility to allow this key hierarchy
technique to be used wherever needed.

<P><LI>A D-H key management infrastructure could be used to manage
asymmetric keys as well as symmetric keys. As was mentioned in the
footnote to Point 6 above, the processes used by D-H can be extended
simply to provide the DSA digital signature algorithm. DSA could be
used for generating the necessary certificates for asymmetric keys,
whether they were DSA keys or RSA keys, and according to whichever
standard (for example, version 5 of x.509 standard) that was
required. Consequently, the NHS would have the option of using its D-H
key management infrastructure as the basis for the management of other
keys as might be needed for any future interworking with other
schemes, for example those which might be used in other European
countries. </LI>

<P><LI>The solution outlined above will take some time to implement,
in pan because of the need to pilot the technology being
introduced. It is appropriate, in this case, to consider what shorter
term, non-strategic solutions might exist. The options to consider
are: </LI>

<UL>

<P><LI>existing suitable COTS (Commercial off-the-shelf) products that
use other algorithms besides Red like </LI>

<P><LI>products that would be appropriate for only a limited range
rather than all applications. </LI>

</UL>

<P>The general problem with COTS products which do not use <I>Red
Pike</I> are that they are either not available for the NHS's use or,
if they are, they do not have an adequate level of cryptographic
strength. There is one specific product; PG? which does not suffer
from these drawbacks. That has been dismissed as not being a suitable
strategic solution for the NHS (see earlier in this Appendix), and a
number of those reasons would also limit its suitability as a
short-term solution. There are a growing number of E-mail security
products, either on or coming to the market, which address some of the
shortcomings of PGI', and one of these (at least one, to Zergo's
knowledge) has recently been upgraded to incorporate the <I>Red
Pike</I> algorithm. That product would have the following advantages
as an interim solution for the NHS.


<UL>

<P><LI>it is an E-mail security utility, and that would make it
appropriate for a good proportion of the NHS's immediate need </LI>

<P><LI>it already has <I>Red Pike</I> in it, increasing its
compatibility with the recommended strategic solution </LI>

<P><LI>it integrates with ordinary office E-mail systems (which
addresses a major drawback of PG?) </LI>

<P><LI>it works with a D-H key management layer (though a rather cut
down version compared to the recommended strategic solution) </LI>

<P><LI>it is available today. </LI>

</UL>

<P>This product should not be seen as a strategic solution for the NHS
for many of the same reasons that PGP is not (see earlier in this
Appendix), and those are.

<UL>

<P><LI>it is designed for messaging and could not be used for
interactive communications </LI>

<P><LI>there is only the one supplier </LI>

<P><LI>it does not have a mechanism for the convenient distribution of
encryption keys, which would limit its suitability for such a large
community as the NHS. </LI>

</UL>

<P>However, it might have some value as a short term, interim solution
for a limited range of applications, and would warrant further
investigation for adoption in this capacity. That further
investigation should also identify any other such products which may
be on or about to enter the market.

<A NAME="Appendix_D"><P></A>
<H2>Appendix D - Glossary of terms</H2>

<P><B>Algorithm (Cryptographic Algorithm)</B><BR>The mathematical
process by which a cryptographic key and some input data are combined
to create a cryptographically useful result. Usually the required
result is either an encrypted version of the data derived from plain
text input data (the encryption process) or plain text derived from
encrypted input data (the decryption process). However, it may also be
a digital signature or a cryptographic checksum or Message
Authentication Code (MAC). The result is cryptographically useful if
it bars anyone other than those authorised to use the cryptographic
tools from decrypting the encrypted data or tampering with the data.

<P><B>Asymmetric algorithm</B><BR>A cryptographic algorithm in which
the keys used for encryption and decryption are different, and for
which it is computationally infeasible to determine the decryption key
(which is kept private) from the encryption key (which can then be
made freely available).

<P><B>CESG (Communications - Electronics Security Group) </B><BR>The
National Technical Security Authority within HMG. A LTK government
department with responsibility for ensuring the security of government
electronic communications and Information Technology.

<P><B>COTS</B><BR> The acronym "Commercial off-the-shelf' used for
products which can be purchased and installed as-is without needing
extensive customisation to make them suitable.

<P><B>Cryptography</B><BR> The field of technology using
mathematically constructed techniques and algorithms to protect
data. The fundamental requirement of these is that some protection
processes, for example the decryption of encrypted data or the
creation of digital signatures, cannot feasibly be performed without
precise knowledge of a particular data string (known as the key) even
if all the other input data is known. This requires that the key must
not be obtainable from knowledge of the algorithm and the output data.

<P><B>DES</B><BR> A long-standing (about 20 years) public domain
symmetric algorithm widely used within the Financial Services
sector. It is not normally available to users in other commercial
sectors unless it is used by them only in relation to the protection
of financial data.

<P><B>Digital Signature</B><BR> A digital value or checksum that can
be used to prove or verify that the data in a message has not been
changed in an unauthorised manner whilst the message has been in
transit across a network or in storage. The term is usually reserved
for checksums calculated using asymmetric techniques, where only the
originator of the message can generate the digital signature but many
people can verify it.

<P><B>Diffie-Hellman</B><BR> A method by which two parties can agree
upon a secret encryption key that is known only to them and which
cannot be determined by an eavesdropper listening to the dialogue by
which the parties agree the key. Named after the inventors of the
technique in the mid 1970's.

<P><B>DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm)</B><BR> A US Federal
Information Processing Standard which describes an algorithm for
creating and checking digital signatures.

<P><B>Equivalent key length</B><BR> For symmetric algorithms, a
rule-of- thumb measure of the believed strength of the algorithm. For
well constructed logarithms, the most efficient way to crack the
algorithm (obtain the secret key from knowledge of the algorithm and
the encrypted data) is to try each of the many possible keys until the
correct key is stumbled upon by chance. This is known as an exhaustive
key search. The number of keys in the key space that has to be
searched in this way is 2n where n is the length of the secret key in
bits. Hence, this gives a measure of the expected effort to crack the
algorithm and can be used (but only as a rule-of-thumb) to compare the
relative strengths of different algorithms.

<P><B>ITSEC/ITSEM Scheme</B><BR> ITSEC stands for IT Security
Evaluation Criteria and is a set of criteria against which a product
could be evaluated to test the level of security it provides. ITSEM is
the IT Security Evaluation Methodology and is a formal methodology
that Commercial Licensed Evaluation Facilities (CLEFS) must follow if
they are to perform ITSEC evaluations with a view to the evaluated
product being awarded an internationally recognised certificate.

<P><B>Key Certificate</B><BR> A data record that authenticates the
owner of a public key for an asymmetric algorithm. It is issued by a
certification authority (often a TTP) and is protected by a digital
signature, allowing the certificate to be verified widely. The
certificate may also contain other fields besides the value of the key
and the name of the owner, for example an expiry date.

<P><B>Key Management</B><BR> A general term for a number of processes
or practices involved in the secure creation, storage, exchange, use
and deletion of cryptographic keys.

<P><B>Key Recovery</B><BR> A capability that can be added in to some
Key Management schemes to allow the encryption keys to be recovered by
a trusted body under strict controls.

<P><B>Message integrity</B><BR> Protecting a message against its
unauthorised modification, often by the originator of the message
generating a digital signature.

<P><B>Non-repudiation</B><BR> Protecting a message against the
originator of the message later being able to repudiate the message,
i.e. claim that it was generated by someone else. Relevant in some EDI
or payment systems where someone might wish to repudiate a large order
or funds transfer sent electronically but in error.

<P><B>Rambutan</B><BR> A restricted HMG encryption algorithm.

<P><B>RC4</B><BR> A proprietary (U.S.) algorithm widely implemented
in, for example, internet protocols.

<P><B>Red Pike</B><BR> An HMG encryption algorithm developed for use
by non-central government organisations (possibly commercial) working
with government. It is represented by HMG as being stronger than DES,
the encryption algorithm normally used within the Banking sector,
though at the same time being releasable (under some constraints)
beyond central government.

<P><B>RSA (Rivest Shamir and Adelmann)</B><BR> An asymmetric algorithm
for encryption and decryption which may also be used for the creation
of digital signatures. The acronym refers to the names of the three
developers of the algorithm.

<P><B>Security API (Security Application</B><BR> programming
Interface) A piece of software capable of providing defined standard
security services, usually drawing on an underlying set of
cryptographic processes. The services are called by application
programs and return their results via highly structured and well
defined software interfaces.

<P><B>Source Authentication</B><BR> Being able to verify that a
message was sent by the claimed originator, often provided by the
originator being required to calculate a digital signature on the
message before sending it.

<P><B>Symmetric algorithm</B><BR> A cryptographic algorithm in which
(in contrast to an asymmetric algorithm) the same key is used for
encryption and for decryption. Hence, the encryption key cannot be
made public as this would immediately expose the decryption key (which
is the key that needs to remain secret).

<P><B>ThamesBridge</B><BR> A restricted HMG encryption algorithm, less
restricted than Rambutan but more so than Red Pike.

<P><B>(TTP) Trusted Third party</B><BR> An organisation trusted by
parties wishing to exchange cryptographically secured messages, to
manage cryptographic keys on their behalf. TTPs may also provide other
services relating to the use of cryptographic facilities

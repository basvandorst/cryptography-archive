Emcas, please switch to -*-indented-text-*-


What I would like, in order of desire (so to speak)
===================================================

 - Strip the saupplied version of SSLeay down to the absolute minimum,
   and write decent Makefile.in's.
 - If you use PGPlib to pack a text file into a literal and then
   subsequently unpack it with PGP, PGP will add stupid ^M's at the end 
   of text lines.  I have to figure out the Correct (tm) way to fix this
   once and for all.

 - Verify that the subset of SSLeay that is included is as small as
   possible.

 - The keyserver should produce output identical to what the ones
   based on PGP produce.  Then you could drop this one in (trade some
   memory for an order of magnitude increase in performance).  It
   should also write HTML, controlled by an command-line option;

 - Verify that PGPlib indeed is RFC1991 compatible.

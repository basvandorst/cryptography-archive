There are a few things you probably would like to know before looking
at this library.

- This is version 1.1 for the benefit of those interested in a PGP
  libary without sufficient documentation for end users.  The goal of
  this release is to obtain feedback on the overall design and
  usability. The ultimate documentation aside, there is almost no
  documentation.

- This software is certainly not written with your privacy in mind;
  don't trust it without first reading the sources carefully.  
  Not that you can't trust me, but if you don't know me, you
  shouldn't (If this statement makes you fell uneasy I am afraid you
  have not fully understood what trust implies).

  Having said that, I must add that I believe this software is well
  written, have no bugs, and, for sure, no trapdoors of any kind (but,
  what else can I say ?).

Emacs, switch to -*-indented-text-*- mode, please

Here are the manual pages to PGPlib.  If need be, I'll write some
more.  When you scrutinize them, you will find that some functions
have had their name truncated.  For example, buf2userid has been
truncated into buf2uid.

These will be part of PGPlib 0.2.

You can verify this release by adding my public key to your keyring
    pgp pubring.asc
and the checking that your copy is intact
    pgp PGPlib.man.tar.sig PGPlib.man.tar
Somewhere in all that output you should find
    Good signature from user "Tage Stabell-Kulo <tage@cs.uit.no>".
    Signature made 1997/05/20 07:40 GMT using 1024-bit key, key ID 71FBD469

You can remove my key from your keyring by
    pgp -kr tage@acm.org
(not that I understand why you would do such a thing).

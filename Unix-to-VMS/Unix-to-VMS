-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

below you will find instructions on how to modify the standard pgp 
distribution so that pgp can be easily compiled on your VAX running 
VAX/VMS.

REQUIREMENTS:  1) an uncompress/unzip utility like gzip to unpack the 
                  compressed tarred file

               2) a tar/untar utility on the VAX or you will be copying 
                  heinous numbers of files!

	       3) a C compiler on the VAX


after uncompressing and untarring pgp the dir tree should look like this 
(starting w/ the dir in which you had the .tar file)

USER1:[BIOCHEM2.FINERTY.PGP.ALL]

	CONTRIB.DIR
		LANGTOOL.DIR
		MD5SUM.DIR
	DOC.DIR
	RSAREF.DIR
		DOC.DIR
		INSTALL.DIR
			DOS.DIR
			MAC.DIR
			UNIX.DIR
			VAX.DIR
		RDEMO.DIR
		SOURCE.DIR	<--  put a copy of global.h here  <-|	
		TEST.DIR					    |
	SRC.DIR			<--  copy global.h from here to ----|
	VMSBUILD.DIR		<--  modify rsabuild.com in this dir.

###MODIFICATIONS

on our system i have had to make the following modifications in order to 
get pgp to compile correctly.  there are two changes to the rsabuild.com
file that comes with the pgp distribution in the vmsbuild dir and a file 
that needs to be copied (not moved!) to the [.rsaref.source] dir.

THESE CHANGES HAVE NO AFFECT ON PGP,  THEY ONLY AFFECT THE CREATION OF THE 

RSA LIBRARY THAT IS DISTRIBUTED WITH PGP!!

make these changes to the rsabuild.com file:

	1) comment out: $ call compile md2c
	2) comment out: $ call compile md5c

you can 'comment out' a line in a .com file by putting a ! at the beginning 
of the line, like this...

	!$ call compile md2c
	!$ call compile md5c

NEXT, make a copy of the global.h file (found in the [.src] dir and put it
in the [.rsaref.source] dir.  global.h is required to build the RSA library
but a copy does not exist in this location so you need to put one there. 
be sure to leave a copy in the [.src] dir so that it will be present when
pgp is built. 

if you are in the [.src] dir (USER1:[BIOCHEM2.FINERTY.PGP.ALL.SRC] in my 
case - see schematic above) type this...

	$ copy global.h [-.rsaref.source]


###BUILDING PGP


now you are ready to build pgp.  change to the [.vmsbuild] dir and type 

	$ @allbuild

this might take a while.  i think it takes about 5 min on our machine but 
as usual, your mileage may vary.

you will find the pgp.exe file in the [.vmsbuild] dir along with a lot of 
.obj files that you don't need.

###CLEANUP

you can delete almost everything once pgp is built.

you need to have these files though...

CONFIG.TXT;1
KEYS.ASC;1
LANGUAGE.TXT;1
MITLICEN.TXT;1
PGP.HLP;1
README.DOC;1
RSALICEN.TXT;1
PGP.EXE

AND in the [.doc] dir, you must have pgpdoc1.txt and pgpdoc2.txt.
pgp looks here to be sure you have these files and will not run without 
them.  read them so you don't post mindless questions to alt.security.pgp.


###RUNNING PGP

you need to modify your login.com (or make one with these lines in it if 
you don't have one) so that the system knows where pgp is and to set the 
PGPPATH variable.

here's an example.

$ pgp2 :== $[DIRECTORY WITH PGP.EXE IN IT]pgp.exe
$ DEFINE PGPPATH [DIRECTORY YOU WILL KEEP YOUR PUBRING IN]

here's what i have in my login.com

$ PGP   :==     $USER1:[BIOCHEM2.FINERTY.PGP]PGP.EXE
$ DEFINE PGPPATH USER1:[BIOCHEM2.FINERTY.PGP]

after entering these in your login.com file, type @login to make the system 
aware of the new symbol and logical.

you should now be able to execute pgp by typing pgp at the prompt.

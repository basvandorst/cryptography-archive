<WRU> (who are you) triggered an answerback sequence from the remote

Since '.' appears twice, there is probably an error in this. One of
them is probably a quote mark?
The presence of the UK pound sign suggests that there were national
variants - whether the US version had $ here is anyone's guess.
I _think_ this is the variety spoken by Creed Model 7 teleprinters.

Thus spake Stephen P. Morgan (smorgan@netcom.com):

>Where might I find a _complete_ Baudot code standard?  (Is there
>exactly one?)

Here is the International Telegraph Alphabet No. 2, as published in the
International Telecommunication Union's "Manual for use by maritime
mobile and maritime mobile-satellite service," 1976 edition.
The numbers in parentheses are footnotes.

I have converted their awkward binary notation, which used Z for one and
A for zero, into hexadecimal (and triple-checked it, so I don't think
I put any errors in).  The hex is the 5-bit value that makes up the
character itself--when actually transmitted, it is preceded by
a zero start bit and a one stop bit.  (Thus, F, hex 16, would be
transmitted as 0101101.)  The stop bit is 1.42 times as long as the
other bits, making it a 7.42 bit code.  The codes were apparently
assigned in order reduce wear on paper tape punches--thus a frequent
letter like E has only one punch (hex 10), while a rare letter like
V has four punches.  This gives it a very strange collating sequence.

My Signal-Corps-surplus Model 15 Teletype uses a different arrangement
for some of the figures:

    4        D         $           12
    6        F         !           16

    8        H        STOP         05
   10        J         '           1A
   19        S        BELL         14
   22        V         ;           0F
   26        Z         "           11
   32       blank keytop           00

FIGS H was the motor stop function.  When you sent a FIGS H, the motors
on the TTYs at both ends shut down.  You restarted them by pressing
the BREAK lever, which interrupted the connection momentarily.

I believe interoperation between TTYs that used FIGS J for BELL and
TTYs that used FIGS S for BELL was common.  I remember copying
commercial TTY traffic to ships in the early 1970s.  When they
wanted to get the attention of the receiving operator, they would
send a string of alternating primes and BELLs, so the bell would ring
regardless of the type of machine.

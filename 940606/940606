MIME/PEM is already in the Internet drafts directory.  Strictly
speaking, it doesn't say anything about direct vs. hierarchical trust.
What it does is remove the trust assumptions from the syntax and let
the user choose how they trust keys.

Now that RIPEM has a library API, the next logical step is to support
certificate chains, which is where it has always been going.
I personally think manging certificate chains from a command line
interface is difficult and should be handled by a nice GUI.  That why
I've been waiting for the RIPEM API which makes a Windows application
easy.   I envision a "Certificates" dialog box that that shows your
correspondents and allows you to click "Details" to see their
certificate chain and to select whether you trust them to certify
others.

Alows use of pgp for encoding messages provided the following are met.

  1)  elm is envoked with a -P option
  2)  The pgp keyrings are pointed to by PGPPATH or are in the current
      directory.
  3)  The user does not see some of the extra menus unless they have an elm
      experience level above novice level.

This was done to stop any new features confusing people used to standard Elm
and had no use for PGP (fools???)

This makes this program a compleate replacement for Elm.

on startup:

 elm -P

  it then prompts for your pgp-pass-phrase.  Normaly it does not check for
a correct passphrase, but that can be compiled in.

main menu:

  k     mails a public key or your whole key ring to a person.

  \     decodes message and then sends it through pipe.

  P     Sends the message decoded to the printer.

  .     Re-enter passphrase.  Either to correct the passphrase, or to wipe
        it from memory.

conformation menu (mail, forget, edit . . . ):

  p	enter pgp menu.

	options then are:
	
	s)ign message
        e)ncode message
        b)oth sign and encode
        e(x)it back to previous menu.

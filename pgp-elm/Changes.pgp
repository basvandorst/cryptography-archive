This version of elm has been altered to make the use of pgp with it much
simpler.  This is not a version of elm that is suported by the ELM development
group.

Any Bugs please email me (egd017@cent1.lancs.ac.uk)

Please only send bugs that relate to my codeing.  (ie if elm2.4pl23 has the same
bug, then its not my fault)

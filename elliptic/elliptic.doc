                Public Key Cryptosystems: Next Generation
                                Introduction

        The purpose of this document is to describe a set of subroutines
which implement elliptic curves over an optimal normal basis to share
secrets over an open channel.  The academic community has long recognized
[1] the power of elliptic curves, but only special implementations have
appeared, and those in patented forms.  Very little documentation exists
in the "amateur" community: one is expected to have the mathematical
preliminaries required to read the papers.

        Reference [1] makes an excellent attempt at breaking this barrier,
but without code examples it is difficult for the amateur to comprehend.
My hope is that these subroutines will aid in creating an alternate public
domain public key crypto system.  I class it as "next generation" because
the complexity of computation is higher than that required for exponentials
in finite fields.  The ability to mash bits into random patterns is also
much better - almost perfect in fact.  The task facing the cryptanalyst is
as difficult as finding the discreet logarithm in a finite field.  The
mapping from an elliptic curve to a finite field multiplies the exponent
of the field size by factors of 3 to 6.  A 200 bit normal basis elliptic
curve is as difficult to crack as a 1200 bit finite field exponential.
Since all that's required to hide is 128 bits for a symmetric key, it is
more than adequate.

        The first part of this document discusses the basic math 
associated with normal bases and attempts to explain where "optimal"
comes from.  The second part covers elliptic curves as used in
this implementation.  This field of mathematics is quite vast and has
been explored for 100's of years.  It will continue to be explored for
a long time to come.  Finally, I explain how a secret key can be hidden
using the above math.

                        Optimal Normal Basis

        A basis refers to a set used to describe numbers.  For base 10
the basis is {10^0, 10^1, 10^2, ... }.  Any number can be constructed
using coefficients in the range 0 <= a < 10.  Thus "347" is 3*10^2 +
4*10^1 + 7*10^0 and in general

        x = sum a_i*10^i        i = 0, 1, ...

        A normal basis [2] has the form {b^p^0, b^p^1, b^p^2, ... }.
For finite fields (Galois Fields or GF) over p^n the number of elements
in the set is fixed.  Any "number" can be represented by

        A = sum a_i*b^p^i       i = 0, 1, ..., n-1      0 <= a_i < p

Notice the difference: we don't care what b means.  It can be any
bizzare concept we like (although calling it complex makes me feel
better).  For integer bases we know how to count, for normal basis we
don't.  Well, _I_ don't anyway.  The reason it doesn't matter is
because the coefficients of each element in the set does make sense
and we can easily keep track of the symbols even if we can't attach
physical meaning.

        For p = 2 the symbols are 0 and 1.  Adding two numbers we get

        C = sum a_i*b^2^i + sum d_i*b^2^i
          = sum ((a_i + d_i) * b^2^i)

The terms are independent so each c_i coeficient is just the exclusive
or of a_i and d_i.  That's easy to do even in C.

        Multiplication gets a bit sticky.  References [2],[3] and [4]
explain this much better, but it boils down to finding what they call
the "lambda" matrix.  Let A = sum a_i*b^2^i, D = sum d_i*b^2^i and 
C = A*D = sum c_i*b^2^i, then:

        c_k = sum(i) sum(j) lambda(i,j,k)*a_i*d_j

Every normal basis can be represented.  They show that some normal bases
have the minimum number of non-zero terms (maximum number of zeros) in
the lambda matrix of 2n-1.  These few are called "optimal normal bases".

        One of the files included is optprime.dat.  This lists all
the optimal normal basis primes allowed for the variable "field_prime"
in bigint.h.  The formulas extracted from the references WILL NOT WORK
for any other primes.  The routine gen_lambda in bigint.c is based on
very particular rules associated with these primes, 2 being a generator
being the main one.

                        Mathematical properties

        There are several interesting and useful things to know
about normal bases.  The first is the "trace" function.  This is the
sum of all the coefficients (usually refered to as parity).  Adding
and subtracting are the same thing in GF(2): just do an exclusive or.
Multiplication of coefficients in GF(2) is the and operation.  This
is easy huh?  Well, here's a weird one for you: the number 1 is represented
by 1 = sum b^2^i.  When we store this, it's all bits set.  Adding or
subtracting 1 to any normal basis number is the same thing as taking
the complement, exclusive or against a word with all bits set.

        Another useful property is squaring a normal basis number.
This is simply a rotaion.  In the representation I've chosen the
coefficient of b^2^0 is the lsb and b^2^n-1 is msb.  Squaring
amounts to a rotate left and square rooting is a rotate right.  This is
very useful when we get to multiplication.

        The lambda table used by the opt_mul routine is used as an
index to determine how many powers of 2 are needed to generate a factor
of b^2^k.  The subroutine shift_index moves a source block the correct
shift amount faster than a bunch of rotates.

        A type one optimal normal basis has two non zero terms for
each value of k.  A type two optimal normal basis has four terms.  Only the
type one version is coded here.  It is similar to a feistal type
network with NUMBITS rounds:  there is a swap of right and left half
words exclusive ored (added) to a permutation (or rotation) of the original
block.  It's not really the same, but similar enough to give cryptographers
a good feeling that we're really scrambling bits well here.

        Taking an inverse is another trick.  The routine opt_inv is based 
on [1] pg 85.  This was fun to code because each bit determines what operation
to do next.  The routine first finds the msb, then works down squaring and
or multiplying new terms depending on the lsb in the window being set or clear.

        Before getting into elliptic curves, there's one more math problem
we need to solve.  It is the quadradic equation.  The solution is not really
written down in any of the references that I have, but they hint at it.
In the file elliptic.c you'll find the function gf_quadradic which explains
the gory details.  Koblitz (in private communication) explained why it's
obvious to mathematicians (i.e. they don't need to read this).  Given a
quadradic equation of the form y^2 + a*y + b = 0: we can determine if it
has a solution or not by first computing the trace of u = b/a^2.  There is
a solution only if the trace is zero.  Let w = y/a.  Cast the original
quadradic as w^2 + w + u = 0.  Since squaring is a rotation and summation
is just exclusive or we can view this equation one coefficient at a time
and come up with a series solution.  Picking the lsb of w as zero, and adding
in lsb of u gives us the next bit of w.  It's easy to walk our way up the
solution for w.  If we had picked lsb as 1 we'd get the complement, and in
fact if s is a solution then so is s+1.  To recover the two possible soltutions
we multiply s by a for the first term and then add a for the second.  We'll 
see why finding solutions to quadradics is important in the next section.

                        Elliptic Curves

        There are so many buzz words in this field it's really hard to
keep track of it all.  There are supersingular and non-supersingular curves,
curves with K=2, K=3, and all the rest, and there are subclasses of subclasses.
It's really fascinating, and lots of people have chosen various branches
and subclasses depending on what they wanted to do.  The particular subclass
coded in krypto_knot comes from open literature and is not patented.  Previous
to 100 MHz processors it was considered too slow a mehtod.  The advent
of 64 bit, 300 MHz processors changes the meaning of slow.

        Because our coefficients are 0 and 1, we're stuck on characteristic two
(K=2) curves.  The arguments given in [1] (pg 89) point to non-supersingular
curves.  The elliptic equation in this case is

        E:      y^2 + x*y = x^3 + a_2*x^2 + a_6.

        In the structure for CURVE I've left room for both a_2 and a_6.
Having a_2 non zero slows things down.  I do not know the cryptographic
significance of having a_2, but if you would like to try, Menezes [1] says 
its trace must be 1.

        To find points on any curve E it is simplest to compute the right
hand side of E (what I call fofx in eliptic.c) and then see if there is a
solution to y^2 + xy + f(x) = 0 with gf_quadradic.  This is easy to do.
The function rand_curv_pnt in support.c does exactly this when searching
for random points on a random curve.

        Like, uh, so what?  Well, the cool part is that once we have points
on an elliptic curve we can add and subtract them.  Adding two points on
a curve in a standard geometric sense is the same as connecting a line
between the points and finding the third intersection with the curve.  Over 
the normal basis math we use the same formulas, but where we end up in 
coefficient space is difficult to see.

        Why does this have cryptographic significance?  Given one point,
it is impossible to know what other two points were added together to
get there.  If the order of the curve (the number of points which satisfy
E) is greater than 2^128, a key can be well hidden.

        To crack a hidden key one first has to compute the order of the
curve being used and check to see which factor of that number matches the
order of the observed point (the number of other points that could be added
together to get there).  Then you have to solve a logarithm problem over
an elliptic curve (which involves mapping to a log problem over a bigger
field size).  This seems hard, but only because I haven't done it yet.

                Multiplication over an Elliptic Curve

        Multiplication of a point P by a factor k is just P added to itself
k times.  In reference [5] a method of converting any factor k into the
minimum number of calculations using addition, doubling and subtraction is
described.  The routines in eliptic.c that perform these operations on
points over a curve are esum, edbl and esub.  The formulas used are derived
in the references as well as attached in the appendix.

        There are 3 sets of math here, so don't be supprised if you are a 
touch confused.  The formulas for adding points are standard algebra.  The 
math they are performed over is a normal basis.  And the multiplication factor
is an integer basis.

        To make calculations go faster, projective coordinates are introduced.
The reason for this comes from the formulas for adding and doubling points.
A division operation is required for the algebra to work.  This is very costly
in cpu cycles - it requires (log_2(NUMBITS) + hamming_weight(NUMBITS) - 1) 
multiplications.  Reference [1] describes how to add and double points over 
projective coordinates.  I've expanded those formulas in an appendix.  They 
aren't hard, but for some reason it took me a long time to get them right.

        The routine flaten in eliptic.c removes the divisor term (z) by dividing
it into the x and y coordinates.  All POINTs are given as (x,y,z) structures.
Given a curve and a point we can reduce the storage requirements by flatening
a point back to 2D and then only keeping the last bit of y/x.  The routines save_
and restore_pub_key in support.c use a_6 from the CURVE, the value of x and one
bit of y/x to pack or reconstruct a full point.

                        Cryptography

        A good cryptographic scheme produces random output.  Using Marsaglia's
"Mother of all random number generators" to create random curves, points and
multiplicands, a comparison was made between the input multiplicand and the 
output x value.  Using n-dimensional serial digit tests, chi-square tests, 
autocorrelation, runs up-down and spectral tests, the output x values passed 
as uniformly random and serially independent.  The results of one spectral 
test pertaining to certain pattern frequencies were inconclusive since  they 
didn't show up using another FFT test.  A given point on a given curve 
doesn't tell you very much and that's why the academics like elliptic curves.  
[Special thanks to Prof. Pat for doing the work.]

        The particular method I chose to hide points was described by
Koblitz in [14], pg 85.  The idea is to set up a public key using a point
on a curve.  The owner of the key has a secret multiplier "a".  Call the
curve E, the point P, and compute Q = aP.  The public key is (E, P, Q).
A sender embeds a secret onto point S and choses a random multiplier r.
The secret is then sent to the owner as (E, rP, S+rQ).  The owner recovers
the secret by computing a(rP) = rQ.  Subtracting this from the second point
reveals S.

        It appears that the density of points is uniformly distributed
for any curve over an optimal normal basis.  I leave it to the mathematicians
to prove it.  To embed a 128 bit key onto a point only requires that the field 
size be greater than 128 bits.  For the 148 bit field used in my testing, this 
leaves 20 bits to play with to find one point with fixed 128 bits for x that 
satisfies a specific curve.  What it means mathematically to increment the upper 
20 bit block until we hit a point on the curve is beyond me - it's an easy 
operation to perform, it embeds specific patterns on a curve, and it is very 
difficult to find.

                        More Work Ahead

        The references explain how to compute the cardinality of curves (#E).
To be secure, a curve should have large numbers of points.  It turns out
that all the points which are connected to each other belong to a group
whose size depends on one of the factors of #E.  To be really secure, we
want to pick a point that is a memeber of a very large prime factor group.

        Chosing random curves and random points is probably secure given a
large enough field size.  The cardinality of the curve is on the order of
2^(n +/- n/2 + 1), where n is NUMBITS.  Once you find #E, you get to factor
it.  Knowing these factors it is easy to find the order of any point on a
given curve.  The structure of large numbers is a few small factors and one
really big one (on average, see [15] pg 171).  Finding a weak point with 
low order (i.e. one with few other commrads on a curve) is hard.

        Even more security is possible using type two optimal normal bases.
This scrambles bits better because the lambda matrix contains 4 shift 
parameters per bit position, not just a swap and 1 shift parameter.  It 
takes 3 times longer to compute but that holds for cryptanalysis too - in 
the exponent!

        Solving for a or r in the public or secret key exchange requires 
an intense amount of work.  At this point I don't understand Weil pairing,
divisor theory, or Schoof's algorithm.  I hope that the basic math routines
will help elliptic curve logarithm solutions.  It should give an estimate
on required field sizes for good security.

                        Conclusion

        Without a doubt elliptic curves over optimal normal bases are strong
crypto.  Combined with compression and fast symmetric key routines the
public key exchange using elliptic curves creates nuclear grade security.

        It is cost effective to build specialized cryptographic hardware
if everyone uses the same algorithms.  Once many crypto algorithms are in
use with equal security, such devices become less likely, or at least more
expensive.  Further, as more people learn that the math isn't really that
hard (just a touch confusing the first time you see it) a much broader
choice will be created.

        Please help to improve, enhance and test this initial offering.
Use it to learn the math and try out some of the other methods described
in the references.  With 100 MHz processors now classed as slow, elliptic
curves deserve strong scrutiny for real cryptographic applications.
Mathematicians don't need code to understand the math or what it means.
For the rest of us, examples help a lot.

Derivation of arbitrary projective points over non-supersingular characteristic
two curves used in esum and edbl routines in file eliptic.c

        To implement an efficient elliptic multiply it is necessary to sum and
double arbitrary projective points.  This derivation has identical results to [1]
except I assume both points are arbitrary projections.  The only reason I
include this derivation is because esum and edbl took me a long time to get
right.  I doubt they have been optimally coded.  Intimate familiarity with the
math is required before attempting to optimze these routines.  If the math
doesn't scare you, feel free to hack the code into better shape.

        Copying from [1] the formulas for summing and doubling over curve E
are

        1)      g = (y_1 + y_2)/(x_1 + x_2)

        2)      x_3 = g^2 + g + x_1 + x_2 + a_2

        3)      y_3 = g*(x_1 + x_3) + x_3 + y_1

        4)      x_4 = x_1^2 + a_6/x_1^2

        5)      y_4 = x_1^2 + (x_1 + y_1/x_1 + 1)*x_3

where P_3 = P_1 + P_2 and P_4 = 2P_1.  Transforming from (x,y) to (x,y,z)
coordinates allows us to easily clear out divisors and replace a costly
division operation with a few extra multiplies.  The projective form of
the curve E is given by

        6)      y^2*z + x*y*z = x^3 + a_2*x^2*z + a_6*z^3

and the transfer to projective coordinates is (x,y,1).  To flatten
projective coordinates back to E we simply find (x/z, y/z).

                        Summing

        Replacing y_i with y_i/z_i and x_i with x_i/z_i in equations 1-5
we get

        7)      g = A/B
where
        8)      A = y_1*z_2 + y_2*z_1

        9)      B = x_1*z_2 + x_2*z_1
and
        10)     x_3' = (A/B)^2 + A/B + B/(z_1*z_2) + a_2

        11)     y_3' = (A/B)*(x_1/z_1 + x_3') + x_3' + y_1/z_1

clearing denominators gives

        12)     z_1*z_2*B^2*x_3' = (A^2 + A*B)*z_1*z_2 + B^3 +
                        a_2*B^2*z_1*z_2

        13)     z_1*z_2*B^3*y_3' = z_2*A*B^2*(x_1 + z_1*x_3') +
                        z_1*z_2*B^3*x_3' + z_2*y_1*B^3
Let
        14)     z_3 = z_1*z_2*B^3
and
        15)     D = A*(A + B)*z_1*z_2 + B^2*(B + a_2*z_1*z_2)
then
        16)     x_3 = B*D

        17)     y_3 = (A + B)*D + B^2*(x_1*z_2*A + y_1*z_2*B)

                        Doubling

        Replacing x_1 and y_1 in 4 and 5, then clearing denominators gives

        18)     x_1^2*z_1^2*x_4' = x_1^4 + a_6*z_1^4

        19)     x_1^3*z_1^3*y_4' = x_1^5*z_1 + 
                        (x_1^4 + a_6*z_1^4)*(x_1^2 + y_1*z_1 + x_1*z_1)

Let
        20)     z_4 = (x_1*z_1)^3
and
        21)     T = x_1^4 + a_6*z_1^4
we get
        22)     x_4 = x_1*z_1*T

        23)     y_4 = x_1*z_1*x_1^4 + T*(x_1^2 + y_1*z_1 + x_1*z_1)

newsapi is a library for accessing Usenet News.

It's designed so other server access methods can be
added, for example, an RPC interface.

It currently speaks NNTP, and a little 'local file'.

./python is a preliminary python interface
./tcl  is some (out of date) tcl tinkering
./News is some C++ tinkering, used by:
./wxwin (wxwin is a os-indepedent GUI c++ kit)

newsapi is brought to you by the U.S. Taxpayers, authored by Sam
Rushing (rushing@titan.ksc.nasa.gov) while in their employ.  (I think
that means it's in the public domain)

Notes:

The file server is missing a posting capability for unix,
and isn't really implemented for win32 yet.

It's likely that file_impdep_type will lose the 'dirsep'
parameter.  That should really be buried in the file server
code.

        INTRODUCTION
        ------------

        The UKACD is a word list compiled for the crossword community.

        In particular, it's intended for setters and solvers of
        advanced cryptic crosswords in the UK; for example, the
        Listener Crossword and the barred puzzles in the Sunday
        broadsheets.

        Although there are many word lists in the public domain, none
        is well suited for use with crossword software such as my TEA
        product (available as TEA100.ZIP).

        This freely distributable list should be more helpful, as it
        is specifically intended for use with crossword software. The
        list will be updated at periodic intervals to correct errors
        and make additions.

        EDITORIAL POLICY
        ----------------

        The basis for the UKACD was a word list of some 500,000
        entries, compiled from public domain sources.

        This was reduced to a list of around 190,000 words by
        eliminating entries that aren't generally allowable in
        UK advanced cryptic puzzles.

        The vocabulary included in the following single volume UK
        English dictionaries was used as a guide to acceptability:

            The Chambers Dictionary
            Collins English Dictionary
            The Concise Oxford Dictionary

        Words are given in all their inflected forms, where
        appropriate. That is, nouns are given in their plural
        form(s); verbs are given as the infinitive, third person
        singular, present and past participle; and the comparative
        and superlative forms of adjectives are included where
        they are reasonably common.

        Common proper names have been included, as they are often
        found in crosswords, even though only Collins of the above
        dictionaries has a systematic coverage of them. Some very
        common words not to be found in any of the dictionaries have
        also been included.

        Some attempt was made to standardise the punctuation and
        capitalisation of entries; in particular, by ensuring all
        proper names start with a capital letter. However, no great
        effort has been put into this, as it only marginally affects
        the usefulness of the list to crossworders.

        Dictionary entries only differing in punctuation or
        capitalisation have been folded onto the single most common
        form. This was done to save space and, again makes little
        difference to the value of the UKACD for setters and solvers.

        FEEDBACK
        --------

        The UKACD will be enhanced with corrections and additions
        based on feedback from users. New releases of the list will
        appear whenever there have been sufficient changes to warrant
        the effort.

        If you find any errors, or have suggestions for additions,
        please e-mail them to me at the address on the first page
        of this document. Provided they are within the scope of the
        UKACD, as defined under EDITORIAL POLICY, they will be
        included in the next release of the word list.

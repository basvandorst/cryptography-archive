      encode.c
      decode.c


Decode.c reads a VCRPLUS code that you find in the newspaper and
calculates:
    date_of_the_tv_program
    starting_time_of_the_tv_program
    run_length_of_the_tv_program


Encode.c is reads a date, start time, and run length then turns
them into a VCRPLUS code number like the ones in the newspaper.



There are a few weak spots in these programs.

    1.  They only work for the usual kinds of tv shows,
        a.  Must start on an even half-hour or hour
        b.  Must end on an even half-hour or hour

    2.  They only handle VCRPLUS code values that are 1-6 digits
        long (these are the ones that start and end on half-hour
        or hour boundaries)

    3.  The VCRPLUS hardware uses "channel mapping" for  channel
        numbers above 19, and for cable tv stations. Just decode
        some VCRPLUS code numbers from each unusual channel  and
        get the "mapped channel" numbers.  For  example  in this
        area the VCRPLUS people have mapped cable  station  ESPN
        to "channel 22".





Example 1:  encode    nebraska  deleware  newyork

            This is a (deliberate) error.  You should
            get back a message telling how to do it right:

Usage: encode  month  day  year  channel  starting_time  length_in_minutes



Example 2:  decode    newyork  nebraska  deleware

Usage: decode  todays_month  todays_day  todays_year   Code_value_in_newspaper



Example 3:  encode 1 4 93 5 900 30

            You have asked for the VCRPLUS code of a tv show
            on January 4th of 1993, channel number 5, at 9 o clock
            (in the morning), that lasts for 30 minutes.
            The program answers back:

               1   4  93   5  900    30    VCRPLUS_CODE=    19297


Example 4:  decode 19297

            Assume current computer date is Jan. 2, 1993

            On January 2nd of 1993 you have asked a question.  You
            want to know "what show does the VCRPLUS code 19297
            represent?"  The program answers back

            Code           = 19297     1   4  93
            Mapped_channel = 5
            Start_time     = 0900
            Length         = 30



Have some fun with this stuff.

tis.

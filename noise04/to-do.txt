Features and fixes to add (or think about adding), in no particular order:

        Implement configuration through command-line options rather than
          rebuilding.  Perhaps writing the driver as a stand-alone
          executable with an uninstall function.

        An API or IO-Control (IOCTL) Interface may be added.

        Write more demo utilities and interface routines. (A TSR which
          samples /dev/random and over time generates a file of random
          noise while in the background would be nice.)

        Write OS/2, Windows 3.x/95 ports.  Make the driver Windows aware,
          so that it will function somewhat better when Windows is active.

        Add sampling of video-card scan lines, more IRQs, and any other
          interesting sources.

        Add sampling of Pentium's internal timestamp counter (RDTSC
          instruction).

        A 286-port of the driver (maybe).

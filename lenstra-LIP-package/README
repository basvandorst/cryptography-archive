Here are the instructions for installing LIP: 

1) Get a copy of /usr/spool/ftp/pub/lenstra/LIP from flash@bellcore.com 
   via ftp.  The sequence of operations should look something like this:
	ftp flash.bellcore.com
	login name: ftp
	password: anonymous
	ftp> binary
	ftp> cd pub/lenstra
	ftp> get LIP XLIP
	ftp> get lipdoc.ps.Z
	ftp> quit

2) Your copy is now called XLIP. It is an encrypted, compressed, 
   tar file. You must decrypt and uncompress it. For decryption you need 
   the key which can be obtained from Arjen Lenstra (phone: 201-829-4878) after 
   he has received a signed copy of the agreement stored in the .ps or .plain
   file in directory /usr/spool/ftp/pub/lenstra. Finally you must use
   the tar command to extract the files and put them in a directory:

	uncompress lipdoc.ps
	des -d XLIP LIP.Z 
	uncompress LIP
	mkdir lip
	cd lip
	tar xvf ../LIP

3) You should now find the files lip.c and lip.h in the directory lip.

4) lipdoc.ps is a postscript file containing a complete documentation of LIP.

Please let me know if there is a problem.

Please find enclosed the latest release of PGPlib in a tar-file, a 
detached signature made by me, and my public key.  To verify that your
copy hasn't been tampered with, simply run
	pgp pubring.pgp
to add my key to you keyring, then
	pgp PGPlib-0.1.tar.asc PGPlib-0.1.tar
to verify the signature.  When you are done, you can remove my key
from your keyring by running
	pgp -kr tage@acm.org

I am pleased to inform you that the signature you verified by means of
PGP was made with the program sign, source is included in the
applications directory within the release, invoked as
	./sign -a -f PGPlib-0.1.tar -k ~/pgp/secring.pgp -p MyPassword
		-u 0x033367AB71FBD469
(the line is folded for your convinience, also, MyPassword is not my
password).  The number 0x033367AB71FBD469 is the last 64 bits of N in
my public-secret key-pair (also kalled KeyID).  I hope you will
appreciate that the signature is properly armored, and that PGP
processed it without complaining.

I am confident you are fully aware that you should obtain a copy of my 
key (and the associated signatures) from some trusted third party :-)

The tar-file contains the directory PGPlib-0.1.  Within it you will
find the file CAVEAT_EMPTOR (read it carefully before using this
library), the file README describing this library in general and this
release in particular, and, as always, the file COPYRIGHT.  The latter
basically says that you can do whatever you like with this library,
execpt saying that you wrote it.

Please enjoy, I hope you like it.

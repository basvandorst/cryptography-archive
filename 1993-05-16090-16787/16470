   I can throw some quick references out for PRNG's.  I'll try to add to this
in the next few days, if I have time.
 
Eurocrypt '89:
 
   Rueppel:  On the security of Schnorr's pseudo random generator
 
   Niederreiter:  Keystream sequences with a good linear complexity profile
                  for every starting point
 
   Beth, Dai:  On the complexity of pseudo-random sequences...
 
   Chan, Goresky, Klapper:  On the linear complexity of feedback registers
 
   [Several others.  Check the book out.]
 
Eurocrypt '91:  There are three major sections on sequences in the collected
                papers.  A couple of articles were
 
 
   Chepyzhov, Smeets:  On a fast correlation attack on certain stream ciphers
 
   Meier, Staffelbach:  Analysis of Pseudo Random Sequences Generated by
                        Cellular Automata.

It is intuitively obvious that CBC will raise the cost of such an
attack.  (I never speak in terms of "breaking" or "defeating" in
discussing crypto, but rather in terms of "cost of attack" or
"resisting.") 

However, since intuition often serves us poorly in crypto,
I once put the question to Don Coppersmith.  He responded that he
was "unable to answer."  (I inferred some information from that
answer.)

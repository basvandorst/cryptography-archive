	This seems the key paragraph. The credit card lads need to get
smacked around a little, methinks. California is surely the ideal place
for this.  Anyone up for launching an initiative to make Visa
partially liable for card-not-present instances of fraud? Surely
their habit of making the relevant numbers more or less freely
available is an entering wedge.

	Me? I use COD. I'm a little too familiar with the kinds of
software that go in to credit auth. terminals and ATMs and so on ;)

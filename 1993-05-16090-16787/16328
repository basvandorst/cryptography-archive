For the voice-phone application, the incoming data will be highly
compressed in any case; even a bad system would probably leave it
indistinguishable from pre-encrypted data.  The chip could in theory
check to see whether the voice compression format is correct on input
data, and broadcast the result, but 1) this would be visible
evidence of "hidden features", and 2) the chip doesn't *know* the
voice compression to be used.

Probably not.

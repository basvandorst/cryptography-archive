  Nit-picking??  Those examples are preposterous on their face -- the analogy
between publicly available information on the Net and publicly available
information in a library book is so straightforward as to make it clear that
legal protections written for the latter must be bent into pretzel knots to
exclude the former, while your proposed analogies already -are- bent into
pretzel knots.

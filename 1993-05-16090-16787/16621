It's less bad even than this.  There are numerous vocoders you can
run on a workstation class machine or fast 486 that give good audio.
GSM is an example.  It should be possible to speed some of these up
somewhat too.  If you're willing to live with degraded audio (still
better than typical ham radio audio etc.) you can get away with using
some very simple coders that can run on a PC-XT class processor
and are simple to implement (e.g. CVSD at 10 kilobits).

If you are trying to get the best possible audio for a given bit rate,
you need lots of compute power.  The Qualcomm QCELP chip is an
example of something that is cost effective when CPU cycles are cheaper
than modem bits/sec.   

If you want to use very low bit rates (4800 bps CELP-1016 was designed
for the army's land mobile radio system, which has much worse audio
bandwidth than telephones) you need fancy vocoders, but with telephone
modems of > 10kbps readily available you can get away with simple
speech coders for many applications.

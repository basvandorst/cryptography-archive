	As I implied earlier, one real disadvantage of a one-time pad is
that for large amounts of data, if you ever plan to recover it, there
has GOT to be a pad hidden someplace. At that point, since the cryptosystem
is completely unbreakable, the only thing a cryptanalyst can break is...

	...you.

	Personally, I like to encrypt stuff with a key that's memorizable,
so I can scream it out at the top of my lungs if I ever have to. ;)

There must be a problem with terminology somewhere, but I have again
checked with a friend working for one of the biggest card manufactureres
and he claims there are three basic type of cards, credit cards which
allow you to use your card for payment up to a maximum limit and if
your card is also equipped with a PIN you can withdraw a certain amount
from ATMs. The next type of card is cash cards, which in the case if
SmartCards they call digital cash.  These cards cannot be used for
payment as with credit cards, and can only be used with ATMs to withdraw
cash.  The type of card I think you are thinking about are called
prepayment cards which are cards that have been credited with a certain
amount and will be debitted every time you do a transaction.  These cards
are like normal notes, they carry serial numbers, but there is no need
for this card to be linked to your person.  The more modern type of
these cards are using EEPROM memories with security features that allow
the card to be credited again in specialized ATMs.

The simplest type of prepayment cards are the telephone cards which
are in use all over the world, but here you have prepayed for a service
and you cannot use it as cash.  These type of cards use one of the
three technologies, magnetic, optical or IC.  The optical cards looks to
be a much stronger competitor to magnetic strip for this type of cards
than IC memory cards. One big user of optical prepayment cards for
telephones is British Telecom.

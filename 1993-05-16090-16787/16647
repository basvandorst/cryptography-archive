There are also 'electronic cheques', in Britain Barclays Bank have one
system (can't remember the name) and the other banks have a common one
called "Switch".  The user makes a payment with their card, and the money
is debited from their bank (US 'checking') account 3 working days later.
The retailer uses a Point Of Sale (POS) terminal, often the same one as
for credit cards, and pays a small charge per transaction.  (Originally
this was the same as the charge for paying in a cheque, but the banks have
been increasing it).  For comparison credit card sales are charged as a
percentage of the value, with a minimum charge.


Hope this helps,

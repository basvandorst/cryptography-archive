I have to differ here.  I worked for a man who had an NSA grant, and was
fired when I blew the whistle on his misuse of grant money.  He was using
government paid labor to run three of his own businesses.  He was buying
equipment for the grant from his own company and charging the government
twice what he charged anyone else.  I got fired.  He was never stopped. 
Some oversight!

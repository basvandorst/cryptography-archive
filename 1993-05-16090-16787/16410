   Don't do this!  It virtually eliminates all security!  It's very very
   very bad!
Certainly using a one-time pad more than once is a bad idea, and reusing
material very much is very bad.  But sometimes it's all you've got;
I decided to include it for completeness, though I realize it's not a
good idea, and wasn't sure whether to put it in the released code or not.
I did make the default behaviour be to fail; the user has to type
an option explicitly to get reuse, and the Usage blurb discourages it.

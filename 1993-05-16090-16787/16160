You actually need a source of truly random data as big as the document that 
you are encrypting, that you never use again.

It's not unbreakable.  In fact, it would take, oh, whole seconds to break.
This is not a one time pad.  This is a toy cryptosystem.

Any periodicity or internal correlation of the stream you XOR into your 
plaintext weakens the cryptographic strength of the system, and provides 
leverage for cryptanalysis.  You really do need a hunk of random data as big 
as your message.  White noise; radioactive decay; that sort of thing.

XOR would probably be a cracker's first guess, and the fact that it's ASCII 
text is enough to figure out the key.

Now, you could use something like an audio CD to approach a random pad, but 
you couldn't use the straight data--you'd have to do something like pick the 
low bit of each sample in succession, and make sure you don't have any 
silence in the key stream.  This would probably be close enough for most 
purposes.

Count on it.  There is no shortcut.  You have to use random data, throw it 
away after you use it, and use another set of equally random data for the 
next message.

I'd recommend learning some more about cryptanalysis.  Your university 
library might be a good start.  Designing strong cryptosystems is a black art.

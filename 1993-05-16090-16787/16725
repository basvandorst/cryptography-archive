Basically, at the time the document is written you can compute
a cryptographic checksum and publish it widely, such as in a national
newspaper.  Stuart Haber and Tom Stornetta came up with a clever
scheme of combining the checksums of N different documents
into a single number X, so that they can publish X and
attach a short certificate to each document which can be
checked against X, instead of having to publish N different
checksums.  I posted the details here a few months ago.

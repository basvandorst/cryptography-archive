It states quite clearly in the recent NIST information that
the Clipper/Skipjack chips will be encased in such a way that
removing the chip will destroy the IC.

Is this done by placing a portion of the IC integral to the
function of the chip in some portion of the packaging so that 
disassembly would destroy it, or including a small portion
of some metal which reacts to air or moisture in the chip
itself?  If the former, how does this prevent reverse-engineering?
It seems that by microscopic analysis a person could still
determine which IC components went where, and reverse-engineer
by hand.  A very determined person, in any case, with a
great deal of technical know-how.

Does anyone know precisely what preventative measures are to be
used to prevent reverse-engineering, or what methods of preventing
reverse-engineering are available and commonly-used?

I would be interested in personal knowledge, commonly-available
sources (government documents easily found in a large library,
trade journals, books and items which a person could find,
not Issue #2 of the Journal of Incomprehensible Obscurity which
printed two issues and then folded), and even obscure sources
if nothing else is available.

Thank you.

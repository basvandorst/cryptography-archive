Sorry Charlie, 1984 came on schedule.  Big Brother is watching, perhaps
not as effectively or as pervasively as Orwell warned but probably about
as much so as he expected.  Remember that part of Orwell's warning was
that most people, watchers and targets alike, would not notice.

I am an avowed opponent of the Clipper proposal, but I am much more an
opponent of the authoritarian, not to say Totalitarian, secret, and
undemocratic process by which the proposal was developed.  Clipper, per
se, appropriately employed, could, as the proponents suggest, actually
reduce much of the illegal wiretapping that now goes on.  However, that
is not its purpose.  Its purpose is to sow fear, uncertainty, and doubt,
and, thus, to discourage all private use of cryptography.

We will reverse that only by shining a very bright light into the black
chamber.

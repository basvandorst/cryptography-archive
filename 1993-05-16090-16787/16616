   I understand that AT&T has licensed Diffie-Hellman from PKP and uses
   it for key exchange in their current secure phone product.

Unfortunately, Diffie-Hellman is probably more appropriate than RSA for 
general-use secure phones and secure fax machines, since you don't
have to do as much for key distribution, teach users how to generate
public/private keys, etc.  PGP key distribution is fine for techies,
but it's a bit heavy-duty for somebody who wants a no-brainer consumer box.

A hierarchical scheme may be workable - you call up RSA's operator pool,
or some franchise such as Sharper Image or Pretty Good Phones, Inc.
give them your credit card number, and your box now has a certificate
good for a year, which gets printed in the page-number line at the top
of the fax page, along with the RSADSI and PGP,Inc. keyids;
otherwise you just get "uncertified" and your keyid.
It does take more infrastructure than DH, and more computer resources
for managing it (NVRAM, key generation software, etc.)

(On the other hand, the DH patent runs out in 1997 or so, which is a plus.)
Without precautions DH is susceptible to active eavesdropping
by someone with two back-to-back compatible systems.  
(Reading the DH half-keys over the phone before talking / faxing works, 
if you recognize the voice, but that's not as useful with strangers.)
The STU-III secure phones use physically distributed "smart key" devices
to prevent this; you can't connect unless your keys are authorized
for the same classification level.

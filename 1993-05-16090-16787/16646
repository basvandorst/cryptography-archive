Sorry. I was speaking of the observer's purpose rather than
its implementation. Insofar as an observer can be trusted
(which is not always in case you have a clever adversary)
it acts as an intermediary -- in effect, an outside organization
asks the observer "Is this person for real?' (in whatever way
they're interested in) and the observer says either "Yup" or
"Nope" in a trustworthy fashion.

In implementation terms, however, you're right -- everything
that the observer receives or sends goes through the wallet,
which can play appropriate fancy tricks to make sure the
observer is not doing anything it shouldn't (or, in some
cases, doing things it should that the owner doesn't want it to.)

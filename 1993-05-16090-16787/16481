We're going to need to have at least 2^80 characters for
a good analysis...

But seriously, basing a crypto system basied on chaotic behavior
is quite a good idea.  To bad when I invented one two years
ago it had been patented by two Frenchmen the previous year...

I believe most such systems fall under the category of
the NP-Complete solving arbitrary systems of boolean equations.

The great advantage of these systems is that they are trivial
to implement in software and hardware, exploit parallelism to
the max and are *extremely* easy to understand.

While in principle the non-linear mappings (S-boxes) are
susceptible to differential analyses, the fact you can do
hundreds of rounds quickly over, say, a block length of
1 or 4k sort of makes this point moot...

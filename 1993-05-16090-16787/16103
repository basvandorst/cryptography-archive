I agree. I would even say more. The world war III (Yes the third), which started
on May, 6th 1945 and ended at the fall of the communism has been won by the
western technology. The generals of both blocks have simulated open atomic
war hundreds of times. Each time, the supremacy of the West came from the
technology. The cryptography is just a part of the technology... It has already
been used as a weapon. There is no doubt about that. Many things can be a
weapon, it would proove clumsy (at least) to forbid anybody to have a stone
in one's hand because it can be a deadly weapon. The problem is the evaluation
of the risk coming from letting anybody using a given thing, which can be
turned into a weapon.

A gun, which is the most obvious example, can kill, but not more than one
person at a time. Some decisions can induce the death of millions of poeple
at a time. For example, speculation on the price of food can induce starvation
in underdevelopped countries. Should the technology which allows this
be left with no control in anybody's hands? It will be the case if really
strong cryptographic systems develop without control and without any
authority being able AND allowed to tap.

The Clipper scheme only seems to make sense if both parties use the same 
session key. A crook who is under surveillance will phone a lot of other 
people, and if law enforcement people could only listen in what he/she 
him/herself said they wouldn't profit a lot (`Go and tell, what's-his-name, 
no, no, yes, to keep the money at his place ...'). Or would there be a 
sufficient echo in the analogue part of the phone to listen to both 
speakers while tapping just one direction? 

Otherwise the L.E. folks would have to obtain vast numbers of keys of 
mostly innocent people to monitor all phone calls of a suspect.

Let me mention two other thoughts as I'm just wasting bandwidth anyway:

Someone said that according to US law, a wiretapped conversation can only 
be used in court if someone had listened in in real-time. With the Cripple 
chip there is a unique identification (and probably a lot of redundancy) 
in the bit stream so that the recording could not be forged by the police 
or the attorney (in theory). Thus a court might accept such a recording 
as evidence even if it was made automatically. 

If a digital voice encryption like the one under discussion here were 
available and were cheap enough to be used in cellular phones by the 
general public, it wouldn't be necessary to further encode the radio 
transmissions (e.g. by spread-spectrum techniques). So it would be 
easier to record and locate the radio signals -- without presenting a 
wiretap warrant to the carrier. Another advantage for the law enforcers??

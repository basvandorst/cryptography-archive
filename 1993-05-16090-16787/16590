	If there's a user-supplied key, it's not resistant to
rubber-hose cryptanalysis. Remember, rubber-hose cryptanalysis
is when you beat the user bloody until they give you the key.
(Or if you're a more civilized country, you lock them up,
and apply economic or emotional pressure)   There aren't a
lot of cryptosystems that can resist rubber-hose cryptanalysis.
I suppose a one-time pad, if you destroy the pad as soon as
you generate the ciphertext  --  but if you're caught they can
still beat you until you tell them what it was you encoded...

The "is known" is the weak part in that argument.  Obviously, any
public-key cryptosystem can be decrypted -- just try all possible input
messages until you match the output.

For private-key crypto, if it is a group, you get no benefit from
double/triple encryption.  (It may be more subject to differential
cryptography, but I don't know enough about that to be sure.)

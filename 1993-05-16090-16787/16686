Though honest men may disagree until the courts pronounce, I don't think the
presence of computers accessing ftp in a library makes them a library
subject to the "protection" of the above clause, any more than a copying
machine in a library makes the copied materials exempt from copyright laws
or a cash register in a library makes cash transactions exempt from any
financial regulations that might apply. (No nit-picking about the particular
examples, please--you get the point).

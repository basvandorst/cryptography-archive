Please see today's (6 May) issue of the New York Times, Business Section.

A well done piece, with the usual NYT diagrams, on the Clipper Chip and the,
more or less, public outcry over the "Clipper Initiative". 

With any luck at all this will help bring the issue to the general public, 
as local publications (doesn't everyone read the NYT ?) pick up the thread. 

Dare I hope that someone other than we USENET radicals are concerned about
the eventual outcome of this thinly disguised attempt to prevent the use of 
real cryptology by the general public. 

On the other hand, perhaps clipper is the best way to deal with the likes of
us. Clearly, we can't be allowed to have our neferious way with Al Gore's
National Data Superhighway. (-:

To paraprase my great, good friend, George; 

I am profoundly cynical about the ability of any agency of the federal 
government to act reasonably, ethically, honorably or cost-effectively on 
any matter affecting my health, safety, or security. The only agency that 
seems to be any good at what they are supposed to do is the IRS (GOD forgive
me, I said something good about the IRS.) And this, as far as I am
concerned, says it all.


Cheers,

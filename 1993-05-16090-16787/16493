This is David Chaum's "Dining Cryptographers Protocol," which he
described in a paper by the same name in the first issue of the
"Journal of Cryptology," Vol 1, No. 1, 1988.

To see the point in a different way, imagine Alice and Bob sharing the
result of a coin toss. They do the coin toss in secret. They announce to
the world "same" or "different" after the toss. If one of them wishes
to send a message, a "1," to a third party (call him Charles), he or
she "lies" (XORs) and says the opposite of what the real coin toss
was. Charles sees a "difference" between what Alice and Bob said, but
has no idea of which one sent the message (that is, lied), because he
doesn't know the results of the coin tosses. (Obviously, both Alice
and Bob know who sent the message, though.)

Extend this to 3 people doing a coin toss while sharing the outcome
with only the person on their right, and you have Chaum's DC-Net. None
of the participants, except the sender himself, knows who sent the
message. Kind of a "crypto ouija board."

Jurgen Bos, a student of Chaum's at the Math Center (CFW (?)) in
Amsterdam, has written a nice monograph on the interesting problems
that come up in DC-Nets. Problems of collusion, of spoofing , and of
preventing "jamming" are the obvious problems that need solution.

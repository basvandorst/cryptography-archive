Fine.  It is defined SOMEWHERE, or SOMEHOW.  Tell us where or how, please.

They are not misleading, but are not correct.  That REALLY makes a lot of

Why post ANYTHING if you are going to not tell us anything, other than the
above, which amounts to saying the quotes are right, but not right.  feh.

You are telling us that the LAW is classified?!?!  That the law that binds
what citizens can and cannot do cannot be made clear to those citizens?

Perhaps you can tell us, if it is true that us commoners cannot know what
we are and are not bound by, how in hell people are supposed to follow
the law?

That is a helluva cute way to write laws - "The law is secret, so you
gotta take our word for what it says, and we can say what we damn well
please, to suit our mood at the moment as to what the law is..."

Assuming you have all this access to privileged knowlege, perhaps you
can tell us commoners how telling the people what is and is not expected
of them is gonna affect National Security.  Perhaps THAT is something
to lean on the congresscritters about - writing laws that are binding
on the people, that say one thing, but that isn't correct and the people
cannot be told what that law is...  How does one prosecute one for violating
the law without telling what the law is that was violated, and how the
person violated it?...

I have heard some pretty ridiculous things and concepts coming out of
DC, but this pretty well takes the cake.  If true, we DO have a government
TOTALLY out of control, completely off the rails, and the people should
start reminding our so-called representatives very loud and clear that
it is government of the people by the people, not government of the
serfs by a bunch of unelected lords.

Is the ITAR classified, or not, and if so, why, and if not why the
cloak-and-dagger bit?

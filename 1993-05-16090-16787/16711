   Reference:  "The FEAL Cipher Family," in the Rump Session of the
procedings of Crypto '90.  Written by Shoji Miyaguchi.
 
   The author contends that a chosen plaintext attack can be defeated by
use of CBC mode.  However, I don't see that this is really true.  If I
know the plaintext of one encrypted transmission with a given key, I should
be able to retrieve known plaintext-ciphertext pairs from the encryption
function.  Then, I should be able to use those to choose a second set of
chosen plaintexts that will give me the desired input values to the
encryption function.  All I need is the IV, which is (I think) usually
transmitted with the message in the clear.  (What am I missing?)

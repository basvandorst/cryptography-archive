Perhaps a year or so back I believe I remember a flurry of activity on reasonably
available lisences for rsa encryption of mail.  My memory was that there was a
simple (one to two page) lisence which allowed one to implement rsa encryption
for internal use only.  I have looked through the faqs, and also through my save
news articles, but seemed to have mislaid this information.  Can anyone give me a
hand here?

Thanks in advance!!

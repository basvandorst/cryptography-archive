   Hmmm.  My understanding was that the observer was *never* to be in
direct contact with the outside world.  Otherwise, Foo Bar Industries
might manufacture an observer that occasionally "leaked" a bit of
information, via a subliminal channel in its signature algorithm.
 
   In fact, I beleive that the observers' signatures on statements like
"I have $100 in my account," or "I have a Master's degree in Nuclear
Physics" have to be blinded by the wallet that contains them, to avoid
any chance of messages being sent from the observer to its makers.

Allright, I know by the discussion on this news group that a LOT of you
have very
strong views about Clipper.  This is probably our biggest opportunity to
express those views to the people who are actually making these decisions, and
if we don't take advantage of it, it will be a huge mistake.  There is only
about a two-week window to get the letters in, so get to it everybody!!!
I'm working on mine.

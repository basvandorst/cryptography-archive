    The messages here regarding presumed government unhappiness 
over encrypted telecommunications led me to wonder about the 
following question(s): 

    As I understand it, 

    1. An encrypted bitstream should look completely random.

    2. With the exception of header information, which basically
       tells how to decrypt the remainder of the message, compressed 
       files should also look random.

    So shouldn't all the .ZIP, .GIF, .ARC, etc. files, as well as 
bitstreams going through modems that do on-the-fly compression, 
look pretty much like encrypted messages? How does the generic 
government Three Letter Organization easily tell the difference 
between ANABELLE.GIF, ZIP (ANABELLE.GIF + ANABELLE.TXT) > 
ANABELLE.ZIP, and KGBCRYPT SPYSTUFF.TXT | TXT2GIF | ZIP > 
ANABELLE.ZIP? (As noted in other postings, you could also take the 
real ANABELLE.GIF and put KGBCRYPT SPYSTUFF.TXT into the lsb of 
chosen pixels.) 

    The basic question isn't whether the TLOs could detect the 
presence of something peculiar if they were to focus on a 
particular file going through the communications system, but 
whether they can pick out "suspicious" files from lots of 
legitimate, if tasteless, compressed traffic? 

    Doesn't sorting through these apparently random bits at least 
complicate life for the TLOs?

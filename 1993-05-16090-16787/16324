Okay, I'm confused.  What's all this "proper security procedures"
about?  They're going to sell devices containing the chip to anyone
who wants one, so what's the point of secure "handling and storage"?

In your dreams.  Any bets on how long before some underpaid
technician who has worked on the chip gets bribed/blackmailed/
tricked into spilling the beans?

Do they mean next year's model, or will chips in existing devices
be upgraded?  To save you the trouble of physically removing your
chip and taking it to a reprogramming center, perhaps the software
can be upgraded via commands in the incoming data stream.  Thus
your chip could be programmed to, say, provide increased security
algorithms or be compatible with new devices.  Gee, it could even
be reprogrammed to silently switch to plaintext mode when it received
a polite digital request from the FBI.

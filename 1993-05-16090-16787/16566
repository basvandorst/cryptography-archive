Yes, I had in mind the security aspects only, as I am not able to
assess the costs in the US. In Europe the SmartCard manufacturers
quote the cost to be about 2 $ per card in large quantities (>10000). 
So the cards themselves are not much more expensive than the magnetic
cards manufactured with special printing techniques and hologram
security IDs. Where the real costs will appear is in the overall
infra-structure, change of card readers in ATMs, change is ATM software,
communication procedures etc.  But all the major card reader
manufacturers are now making combined readers for magnetic and
Smartcards.  In shops over here they are now installing combined swip
magnetic readers and smartcard readers and in large supermarket
chains they have had them since about a year or so. Smaller firms
in France have card readers attached to their Minitels and do the
transactions over the Minitel terminals.

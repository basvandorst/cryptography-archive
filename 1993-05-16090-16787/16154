Both the above assume that we are talking about NSA vs. the "outside". I was
discussing the possibility that the NSA would lie to the President
(formally) about Clipper. There are no legal tricks, national security
concealment, etc. that the NSA could use to get away with this if the
President or one of the independent auditors found they were lying. The
damage would be severe.

Let me remind you of the major damage the CIA suffered when they enraged
Congress. It took years for them to recover, and many jobs were lost. All it
takes is for a committee to refuse to approve significant parts of their
budget and they are in deep trouble without any need to try anyone. I
suggest that those who doubt the CIA or NSA can break the law these days
with impunity review Congressional oversight history and the whole
Intelligence Committee investigations episodes. The bad old days have been
over for some time. These days our intelligence agencies are doing less than
many think they should rather than more. They are still agonizing, for
example, over whether they should commit economic intelligence gathering
against our economic adversaries and pass the info on to our companies, as
the French and probably others do.

Not necessarily. There have been messages arguing that secret systems can be
more secure. Don't confuse trust with security.

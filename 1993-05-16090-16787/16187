As well, she was talking there about a different problem, that of
designing a secure system.  This is a problem of designing an
insecure system.  The need for insecurity is what mandates secrecy.

The flip side, though, is that the insecurity shouldn't either.
Here it does.  If the algorithm becomes known (what's the rated
lifespan of this system anyway?), secure and compatible systems can
be built.  Not that I'm complaining about that.

At 16 Mbps?

Clipper is hardly going to set the world on fire, if ATT's pricing
structure is any indication.  For the ~$30 the chip costs, you could
probably get a general-purpose embedded processor capable of doing
whatever encryption technique you choose, including secure ones.
You only need kilobyte/sec rates for this application, not megs/sec.

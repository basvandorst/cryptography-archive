Actually, they may have.  Mosaid, located in Canada, routinely
provides reverse engineering data for your competitor's chips, as well
as doing some design of their own.

For those of you wondering about the Hughes security patents, the
ideas boil down to using focussed ion beams (or possibly electron
beams) as a way of modifying devices post-fabrication.  The primary
idea seems to be changing the threshold voltage of transistors, such
that gates are permanently set to one or zero outputs, or selective
gate inputs are permanently set to a one or zero.  They also talk
about intentionally slowing down selected logic paths such that
circuits behave in one manner at low speed [test mode] and a different
way at normal speed.  The testing problem is apparently addressed by
also writing the modifications performed into a ROM area on the die,
so that the tester can know what to test for.

For physical security, the patent I've discovered so far uses a pair of
chips face-to-face with soft indium metallic interconnect, such that
the connection is broken if you attempt to disassemble the pair.
Keeping data in volatile form, cycling between the chips then
provides the security, though you presumably could also just detect a
break in the connection and intentionally erase the stored data.

If anyone is curious, no, I definitely don't think these techniques will
withstand a concerted attack.

Could someone tell me (in simple terms) how the public key is derived and 
related to the secret key in something like PGP. Is the public key a small
part of the secret key ?
How is the alogrithm converted into ascii when about 255 char.s are available?
Is this enough ? or has the encryption tool got to have an ascii `wrap around'
for the characters 1-0, a-z, A-Z, etc

Thanks (apologies if questions too stupid !).

Can anybody tell me where Public Key Partners is located or where any
other party owning US patent 4405829 (RSA algorithm) is located?  I was
told they were in Sunnyvale, but Directory Assistance reports they have
no such listing.

This is legal notice to Public Key Partners that I would like to use
PGP, although I have no intent to do so now.  I will make a reasonable
attempt to locate you, but if I cannot find you, I will have to assume
that PKP no longer exists or has relinquished rights to the patent.

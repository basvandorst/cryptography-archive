   I have developed a cryptographic algorithm based on chaotic behaviour.
   I invite any body who is interested in this field to break
   this algorithm.  Please let me know if it is possible to 
   beake it and if so let me know the work factor (time, cost,...etc).
   Here is an example of ciphertext:

Hey! Me too! Me too!
I've invented this rilly cool algorithm, too!

Here's the ciphertext:

q

I won't provide the plaintext, but I can give you a couple of hints:
a) It's about 30k long
b) It contains Richard Nixon's Social Security Number
c) It's written backwards in Esperanto

Good luck, and thanks for your time!!

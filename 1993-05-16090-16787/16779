Bill is quite right. Most people are either unaware or simply do not care 
that routine surveillance of the populace in 'democratic' countries is
becoming near total. 

Between video surveillance in buildings, video 
surveillance of city streets, video surveillance of major highways, 
audio surveillance, wiretapping, cell phone monitoring and tracking and
the monitoring of bank accounts and credit card transactions, privacy is 
an illusory state of mind.

The arguments I hear are how this wonderful technology promotes public safety
by assisting in the apprehension of criminals. And, after all, to be "safe"
you won't mind being constantly watched, will you? Un less, of course you 
have something to hide..... A great many people accept this argunent, 
essentially preferring to surrender privacy and real freedom for the dubious 
benefits of 'enhanced' security. 

True freedom means taking responsibility and it may be painful at times. Many 
prefer to shirk the responsibility by surrendering their freedom, feeling 
that they get a bargain in the process. In my view, and in my country at 
least, there is not a shred of evidence of the advance of surveillance is to 
serve the ends of an oppressive government. There is considerable evidence of 
politicians listening both to the bleats of sheep that elect them and to 
the police, for whom total surveillance enables the apprehension of a speeding 
motorist to be as easy as shooting fish in a barrel. However, it has not yet 
lead to the conviction of a single terrorist, of whom Great Britain has 
more than its share.

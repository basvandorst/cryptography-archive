NBS  stated in their original validation procedures publication that they
could validate  HW, not SW products.  They allegedly didn't have the
capability to validate various SW implementations on every different
machine. There may have been some concern that  the SW versions could
somehow stray from compatibility.  There are validated DES products which
are SW based in dedicated processors.

DES Validation does not change the output to anything magical.  Some
products have been validated by NBS/NIST and other manufacturers have
choosen not to validate per FIPS, but are compatible with validated
prducts.

Very low information content in most music most of the time, so easily
breakable---also key search space is ridiculously small.

(Also the human ear could probably pick out the spoken message and the 
 music from the resulting composite signal simply from rhythm and pitch
 clues!!)

Perhaps a solution is to record the one-time pad as analogue-derived
white noise on a DAT tape...  Still have to distribute keys by hand
though (but that's sort of necessary for one-time-pads!!)

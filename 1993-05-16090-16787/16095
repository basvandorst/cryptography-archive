(I think that they're copyrighted, not patented.)  If they're really
curious, they can always disassemble them.  Heck, we'll even provide them
with a disassembler (MacsBug) free of charge.  If you mean that we won't
publish our source code to it, you're right.  But anyone who owns a Mac can
try and figure it out on their own.  Or get a job in R&D at Apple. :-)

So, how can I "disassemble" a Clipper Chip and figure out how it works?

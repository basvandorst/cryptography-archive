The real standards in making secure mail work involve making
identifiers, magic numbers, header formats, and the like in some
consistent way so that there is adequate information for different
implementations of secure mail to work and so that future extensions
can be backward compatible.  Substituting another encryption scheme
for DES should be as easy as defining a new MIME content type, and
certainly does not warrant a "return to the drawing board."  One could
use IDEA or Skipjack (though I'm sure few people here would choose
that one :-) or one-time-pads (though that would make encrypting the
key rather expensive) or a classic rotor scheme or most anything.

There are, of course, social and political barriers to such, but not
technical ones.  But I believe that, in general, it's important for
Secure-Mailer 2.0 to be able to interoperate with Secure-Mailer 1.0 as
much as possible, and it should interoperate with
Email-Security-Program and other software as well if possible.  I
suppose some people disagree with that.

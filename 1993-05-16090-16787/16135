per 5.,7.  It sounds like the two chips get involved in a link negotiate with
each other.  I  would be willing to bet you could still do superencryption
if you restored it in real time.  The idea is to deny an outside party
the session key.  I am willing to stipulate its alright for both parties
chips to know it.  There is probably sequence numbers used in transmitting
blocks (fields), making it more difficult to spoof.  Another method would
be to retransmit the information in the LEF in the session key  and compare 
checksums.

The part I don't like is 4. and 7. 

The family key is not fixed in silicon other than by programming.
The implication is that there can be more than one family key.

Some of the control software is loaded as well.  7. mentions that
there are programming options with regards to the law enforcment field.

Want to take odds the politicos use a system untappable?  How come
the phrase "If your not cop, you're little people." comes to mind?  

This has a smell similar to congress exempting itself from OSHA and darn near
everything else.

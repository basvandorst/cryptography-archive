Quite simple to tap a specified phone, you just have to spot the beginning
of the communication and not change the LEF block. Do not make the mistake
of setting it to 00...000 ! The device would enter a non-crypted mode and
warn the one who's using it ! No, just change the bit number <<?>> from
0 (or 1 or f(LEF), or ???) to 1 (or 0 or ~f(LEF), or not(???)) and the
clipper will enter a special mode, with a special key, directly provided
by the eavesdropper... No need for escrows. It would be a very good
reason for secrecy, wouldn't it ? The only problem remaining is to have
the phone exchange computers cooperate, it might need a warrant (?)

Funny that the same poeple who do not accept the statement << it you want to
crypt, it means that you DO have something to hide ! >>, use exactly the same
one against he government! Note that I REALLY think that your government HAS
something to hide!

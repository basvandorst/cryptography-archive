   I've been reading some articles about linear complexity profiles, and I'd
like to ask what's probably a pretty simple question.  Are all finite-length
sequences generatable by some finite length LFSR?  It would seem like they'd
HAVE to be, since the LFSR could be pre-filled with the value ahead of time.
Or am I missing something?
 
   Am I correct in my understanding that the linear complexity of a binary
stream is the length of the shortest LFSR that could generate it?  Am I correct
that the linear complexity of a PRNG is the length of the shortest LFSR that
could generate all output streams of some length from that generator?  Then,
if for all binary stream lengths N, the shortest LFSR lenght was also N, would
that imply a strong PRNG?
 
   Thanks,

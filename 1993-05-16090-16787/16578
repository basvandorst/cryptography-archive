Maybe they'd all been shot before before I started wearing long pants? :)

Two things occur to me:
	
	1. OTP is regularly discussed in this group in admiring terms. There is 
a world of difference between its near perfect theoretical performance and the 
security afforded by a practical application under operational conditions. If 
any doubt this, agree with a few likeminded friends (say 30), in widely 
separated sites, to lay aside your PGP/RIPEM for a year. Develop a good OTP 
(not too difficult) print an edition and securely distribute it (no cheating 
on the security). Each pad holder to to encrypt not less that three messages 
per day, each containing not less than 100 words. Copies of all traffic to be 
filed in plain and ciphertext. At the end of the year, if you are all still 
sane and speaking to each other, gather in all pads and traffic copies and 
see how effective your 'unbreakable cipher' has been. 

In short, unless there is, really and truly, no alternative form of secure 
transmission, OTP sucks.    

	2. What was commented in the original post, was not error in 
operational procedure (which I take to be described above). It was the policy 
to, quite unnecessarily duplicate OTP editions to sister services. Why would 
they do that?  I am not saying that people do not make mistakes but this is 
no mistake. In fact, it resembles a deliberate compromise of the cipher.

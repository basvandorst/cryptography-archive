Right now, the only solutions extant involve trusted
time certificate servers that can time-stamp your
documents.

In the style of PGP, though it seems reasonable to
think about a distributed rather than hierarchical
solution such as relying upon a large number of
semi-trusted systems unforgeable time-stamps.

For example it would be fairly trivial to send
you a "ping" robot mail reply that would give
you E(m,t) where m is your message that you want
timestamped, t is date and time UTC according to my clock,
and E() is encrypting under my private key.  TO
save bandwidth the m you send me can be of course
just the message digest of your document.

 Wheee!  Right down my alley!

 The first two were among the 213 references in my Cryptologia
 RNG paper from April '91; I found the other in my files:

 Gunther, C.  1987.  Alternating Step Generators Controlled by
 De Brujin Sequences.  Advances in Cryptology:  EUROCRYPT '87
 Proceedings.  5-14.  Springer-Verlag.

 Siegenthaler, T.  1984.  Correlation-Immunity of Nonlinear
 Combining Functions for Cryptographic Applications.  IEEE
 Transactions on Information Theory.  IT-30: 776-780.

 Vogel, R.  1985.  On the linear complexity of cascaded
 sequences.  Advances in Cryptology:  EUROCRYPT '84.  99-109.
 Springer-Verlag.

 (but don't miss the classic:)

 Golomb, S.  1982 (original publication 1967).  Shift Register
 Sequences, Revised Edition.  Aegean Park Press.

 (or the consequences of Berlekamp-Massey for attacking LFSR's,
  the algorithm is probably best described in a coding-theory
  text, e.g.:)

 Blahut, R.  1983.  Theory and Practice of Error Control Coding.
 Addison-Wesley.

 Clark, G. and J. Cain.  1981.  Error-Correction Coding for
 Digital Communications.  Plenum Press.

 (and don't miss this famous result in modern stream cipher
  cryptanalysis:)

 Siegenthaler, T.  1985.  Decrypting a Class of Stream Ciphers
 Using Ciphertext Only.  IEEE Transactions on Computers.
 C34: 81-85.

 (which breaks:)

 Geffe, P.  1973.  How to protect data with ciphers that are
 really hard to break.  Electronics.  46(1): 99-101.

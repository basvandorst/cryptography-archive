Summary: If Clipper can be reverse-engineered, observers won't work.

Several people have argued that it will be feasible to
reverse-engineer Clipper chips, even though they're designed to
prevent reverse engineering.  If these people are correct, then
it will also be feasible to reverse-engineer David Chaum's
proposed "observer" chips, as described in his August 1992
Scientific American article.

	  There is such legislation.  It's in the Arms Control Act.  I have
   looked this up.  Look in the index to the USC under Arms Control.
   [....]  The general export control system is administered
   by the Commerce Department, and, while a pain, can be dealt with.  There's 
   a separate system for "arms control", administered by State and Defense.
   This controls the import and export of items listed on the "Munitions List".
   The Munitions List (which is a real list, published in the Code of
   Federal Regulations) lists all the items for which "arms control" applies.
   Items like "battleships" and "rifles" appear.  Unfortunately, so does
   "cryptographic equipment", because, when the Munitions List was created
   decades ago, civilian cryptography barely existed.  Cryptographic
   equipment is the only "dual use" technology covered under arms control,
   and NSA has lobbied strongly to keep it that way.

However, what constitutes "equipment"?  Is software "equipment",
or only hardware?  Some of the rules have export restrictions on
equipment and "technical data", but import restrictions only on equipment.
(Does software become hardware if you store it on magnetic media
and physically ship the media?)  The rules for technical data also
appear to be different for publicly available data.

   Importing or exporting "arms" is complicated.  Among other things,
   you have to register as an "arms dealer" (Jim Bidzos of RSA had to do this).

On the other hand, RSA not only imports software, they export it,
and they presumably want to export hardware containing their software,
such as ROMs and maybe smart cards or other such widgets;
they certainly want to sell their software to other people who export hardware.

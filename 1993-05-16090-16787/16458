Hi,
I am looking for hints/references/sources for the following problem:
Assume you have an (encrypted) message. Now, by natural causes, or by
action of an enemy every 16th (or every 2nd) bit is dropped. So the
message you receive is 1/16 (1/2) shorter than the one you have sent.
The receiver now wants to recover the message. He does not know what
bits (in what frequency, which may not be constant) were dropped...
Has anybody an idea if there is existing work for this scenario ?
Simple ECC seems not to be helpfull...
Friendly greetings,
	Germano Caronni

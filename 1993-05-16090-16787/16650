We should perhaps move this discussion to alt.security as it has
very little to do with cryptography.  To get a better handle on
my "digital cash" term I have also contacted a banking friend of
mine and he contradicts some of the statements made by my
Schlumberger Smart Card friend. 

What my SmartCard friend called cash cards are in banking circles
called debit cards. Credit cards and debit cards together are called
bank cards. The debit cards, while allowing you to get cash from
ATMs are also used as as Anthony mentions as electronic cheques.
One such card is EuroCheque which is well implemented in Europe.
In Switzerland this card can be used at POS terminals, which are
called EC Direct.  No signature is needed to use this card at a POS
terminal, only the card and your 6 digit PIN code is used.  The
PTT (Post, Telephone and Telegraph) cards that I have mentioned earlier
can also be used at POS terminals.

The banker claims that the term "digital cash" is no longer used
in bank and financial circles. He says this term was coined long ago
when people invented cash- and paperless banking, but that it 
quickly went out of use.  The correct term to use is EFT and EFTPOS,
Electronic Finacial Transaction and Electronic Finacial Transaction at
Point Of Sale.

So I am convinced that I was wrong in using the term "digital cash"
and I promise never to use it again, :-).

The banker had some other information about the use of SmartCards
in USA. He said that the use of SmartCards in USA is mainly by government
agencies. Apparently the DOD and the State Department are using
SmartCards for identification.  Much more interesting is the fact that
the US Marine Corps is giving SmartCards to its recruits and that they
receive their pay, make purchases and withdraw cash using these cards.
He also mentioned that NSA is experimenting with SmartCards for 
use in various access schemes.

My Schlumberger friend says that the use of SmartCards for identification
and access is increasing. During the Olympics in Barcelona the staff
used SmartCards with their finger print digitalized and stored on the
card. Access to the area was via gates controlled by a SmartCard reader
and a finger print sensor.  He also says that one European intelligence
service are using SmartCards and retina sensors for access control to
restricted areas.

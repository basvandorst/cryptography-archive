I am looking for information about known plaintext attacks on RSA
signatures.  

I have not only the knowledge of the original input but also control
over it.  The data is then 'signed' and I have access to a public key
that can decrypt the signed data.  Does the ability to control the
input give me any advantage in cracking the private key so I can sign
things myself?

The question arises because I hear that some games console
manufacturers are looking at encrypting CD-ROM games with a private
key so that the console will only use 'authorized' games.  Since a
CD-ROM represents 600,000,000 bytes of known plaintext and you can
disassemble the console to find the public key I was wondering how
secure is this?

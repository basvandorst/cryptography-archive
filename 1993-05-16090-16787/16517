   Well, the DES seems to have been designed with S-boxes that resisted
differential cryptanalysis.  But suppose they had provided a longer key
(128 bits, say) which was breakable with some reasonable number of chosen
plaintext pairs.  This would be a kind-of "trapdoor," in the sense that
probably only a few select national security types in various agencies
knew about it.
   It is also possible, although I doubt it, that DES *was* built with some
specific cryptanalytic technique in mind that could break it.  If so, when
it's finally rediscovered, it'll probably make some *real* waves.

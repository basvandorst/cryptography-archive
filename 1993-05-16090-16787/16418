Norton Utilities contains a program called WipeInfo that will completely wipe
a file with a pattern of 1's and 0's according to DoD specifications.  Once
this has been done, that file is GONE.  It cannot be recovered, unless you
take the drive apart and examine it with special equipment. (I don't know
if it is possible to recover a wiped file in this way)

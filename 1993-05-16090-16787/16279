Check out a book on VLSI design...the one I have handy here is "VLSI
Design Techniques for Analog and Digital Circuits", Geiger, Allen & 
Strader, 1990.  They have some nice die photos, and the functions are
pretty obvious to someone familiar with VLSI.  You can draw out a schematic
just from looking at the photos.

Remember that the various layers of resist are exposed using UV light and
masks...you don't necessarily need the resolution of an SEM or STM to see
the features (1u or 0.5u typical, MAYBE for 0.2u bleeding-edge technology
like an Alpha CPU) a good optical microscope will do, although you probably
want to use polarizers to increase constrast.   The buried 3-D features
show up in 'bumps' or 'troughs' easily visible at the surface of the chip,
or in colored areas due to differing oxide thickness and optical rotation
of your polarized light source.   Also be aware the MINIMUM feature size
is generally specified in the fab process...most features are several times
larger than the minimum feature size, making them easier to see.

Check out a VLSI book and see for yourself! 

Nearly all the circuitry can be deduced from looking at the die photo
and a basic knowledge of VLSI...there's only so many ways to make a 
transistor, and the ways to connect them together efficiently into
standard building blocks is well known.  You don't even have to know
the doping of P-type and N-type to work out the functions. 

The main barrier is simply the complexity of the chip.

RAMBUTAN is an encryption algorithm that has been available for 'approved' 
use in the UK for several years. I do not know of any imlementations of it 
ex-UK. AFAIK the algorithm was developed by a UK govt agency and is it is not 
released into the public domain. It is supplied to cryptosystem manufacturers,
some of whom have had their products ITSEC certified (IT Security and BT) and 
also other manufacturers, such as Data Innovation which implements RAMBUTAN in
its ED600 X25 encryptor. It only seems to be marketed in hardware 
implementation. In terms of security provided, it would appear to rate 
similarly with DES as it is found with DES as an optional specification in 
some equipment. However, it does not seem to be as widely used, commercially, 
in the UK as DES, judged by the range of equipments offering one only one 
cipher or the other.

The above is from memory but I hope it helps.

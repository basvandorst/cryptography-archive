In production volumes of 10^8, a stone-stupid piece of printed PVC with a dab
of cheap magnetic paint on it is difficult to compete with.  Laminating on
a photo of the authentic cardholder, as Citibank is now doing on a customer-
option basis, should help a lot against in-person fraud using cards stolen
from the holder or from the mail.

Once you've decided to abandon simple imprinters and go to online terminals,
the incremental cost for decent security (and PIN entry) in the terminal is
small.  The difference in cost between a smart-card terminal and an online or
dialup terminal is also small.  The number of cardholders will always exceed
the number of terminals by a large factor - you are better off doing the bare
minimum to the cards, and more to the terminals and network.

Truly anonymous digital cash is a great idea, but it is doomed unless there is
a major change in political climate.  Governments don't want it, and will
stop any attempt by private financial systems to provide it to any significant
extent, unless the relationship between people and their governments is once
again rectified.

Smart cards are as useless today as they were in 1979, when I worked on them
just long enough to figure out that they were mostly useless (regardless of
the admitted technical fun-factor).

Sigh. Unfortunately I am
a) not expert enough to solve your ciphertext without further info
b) am not willing to spend the time to solve it.

You see, it is rather easy posting some encrypted stuff here,
(would like to do this with my self-invented algorithms too)
but it has usually no sense. Unless your crypt.alg. is extremely
easy, and it does not seem to be; much more data, some correspon-
ding plaintexts and most likely a description of the algorithm
is needed. 
May I most kindly point you to the FAQ of sci.crypt which will
tell you some things about posting cryptograms to this group ?

Not that I would not like to try to solve this one, but on the
first glance, without knowing the algorithm, I simply wont.

Friendly greetings,

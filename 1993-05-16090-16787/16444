Everyone knows you're supposed to be VERY careful about not revealing
your PIN number for your ATM card.  How are you supposed to stop this
new trick???  At the Buckland Hills Mall, in Manchester CT, last week,
some scam artists installed a fake ATM machine.  They had negotiated
with the Mall officers, pretending to be Bank officials, and had gotten
permission.  Apparantly, they even got the pone company to come in and
lay down some lines.  Then, they installed an ATM machine they had stolen.

It was programmed to read off the account numbers, remember the PIN as it
was typed, then claim some kind of error and refuse to give out money.
They left the machine in the mall for a WEEK, collecting PINs, then they
came back, took it machine back to "repair", and have since printed up
new cards, and have been using the PINs to siphon off money.....

Why didn't I think of that??

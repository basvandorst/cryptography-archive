I have before me a paper entitled Experimental Quantum Cryptography by
Charles H. Bennett (IBM Research), Francois Bessette, Gilles Brassard, 
Louis Salvail (University of Montreal), and John Smolin (UCLA).  Dated
May 1, 1990.  The abstract reads:

We describe initial results from an apparatus and protocol designed to
implement "em quantum public key distribution", by which two users, who
share no secret information initially:  1) exchange a random quantum
transmission, consisting of very faint flashes of polarized light; 2)
by subsequent public discussion of the sent and received versions of
this transmission estimate the extent of eavesdropping that might have
taken place on it, and finally 3) if this estimate is small enough, can
distill from the sent and received versions a smaller body of shared
random information (key), which is certifiably secret in the sense that
any third party's expected information on it is an exponentially small
fraction of one bit.  Because the system depends on the uncertainty
principle of quantum physics, instead of usual mathematical assumptions
such as the difficulty of factoring, it remains secure against an
adversary with unlimited computing power.

Fascinating reading.

   Does the Clipper scheme allow for an attack on the algorithm
using differential analysis?   This scheme allows a chosen clear
text and chosen key attack.   The chosen clear text is obvious.
The chosen key could be more difficult.   Presumeably the serial
number, key, etc. are programmed into the chip using known technology.
This could be PROM (fuse links), (E)EPROM (floating gates), or
any other non-volitle technology.   Some designs allow bits to be
reprogrammed to any value while others only allow bits to be cleared to zero.
It is possible that the key could be changed in a chip as part
of a chosen key attack.

   To further complicate things the design of the chip could disallow
reprogramming as a security feature.   This is done now in some
microprocessors.   These schemes can be defeated using e-beam scanners
or mechanical probing devices.

   The question remains; can the algorithm be determined with a
chosen clear text and a chosen key attack?

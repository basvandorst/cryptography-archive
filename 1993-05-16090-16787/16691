  (sorry if this is a duplicate; I forgot sci.crypt in my initial post)

Can anyone recommend good trade rags on security issues?  The most recent
FAQ that I could find, and the CERT FTP site, seem to only reference books,
conferences, and research journals.

These are all valuable, but what I am lacking is a way to keep tabs on the
products and the general direction in which the commercial sector is
heading.  I guess I'm looking for the equivalent of Network World or Data
Communications, for security issues.

I have so far only seen InfoSecurity Prod News, the DataPro info security
reports, and the Computer Security Institute publications.

Thanks for your time,
Mike

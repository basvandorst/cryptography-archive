This is great in principle; the difficulties arise when you try to be more
explicit about exactly what it is you are doing.  For one thing, unless n is
pretty close to the number of bits in the message, most messages are pretty
easy to read.  This eentexce hrs evury fvfth nettek chawged;xdo ypu haye anp

Error-correcting codes are usually designed to deal with cases where n is
much smaller than the number of bits in the message.  Finding ECC's that are
reasonably computable when n is very large isn't easy.

In addition, what's the key?  Cryptosystems should allow multiple keys.  In
your case, the key could be the particular ECC used.  However, while in theory
there are tons of ECC's, the known ECC's that you can actually compute are
drawn from fairly small classes.  It would probably be possible for an
opponent to try them all.

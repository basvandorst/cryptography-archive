     The answer is (4).  Just off the top of my head I can think of
a library that, unfortunately for the Internet as a whole, has a
collection of MacIntoshes on a state university campus network that
is part of the Internet.  Those machines have TCP/UDP/IP software
and anyone can walk in off the street, sit down at one of those Macs,
get whatever they want via anonymous ftp, download it onto a floppy,
and walk out of the building carrying the floppy.  No questions asked.
It is quite possible that other such libraries exist within the U.S.A.
     And just to head off any flames, no, that library isn't here.
We don't allow unsecured, non-authenticating machines to have direct
access to anything outside of our campus.

A warning is of little use if you don't point out the error, if any,
or at least direct the reader to where accurate info can be obtained.
Operating in a state of vague fear intended to paralyze does not go down well
with many people.  Some tend to get downright testy about such things.

VERY informative.  About as informative as when someone asks "Where am
I?", and one responds with "You are here.", or the answering machine
with the recording that says "You have reached a phone.  Leave yer meg"...

With friends like that, who needs enemies?  At least with an enemy, one
KNOWS the individual/entity is out to destroy him, and can endeavor to
do onto him before he does onto you with a clear consience.  AKA
``self-preservation''...

Please enlighten us as to how someone can be convicted on a violation
of a law without having to inform the person (and the public) of the
nature of his transgression, thus letting the world know?  One does have
a right to a public trial - unless our Constitution has been TOTALLY
trashed by "greater good" elitists.  How can such elitists expect
commoners to play by any rules they dictate, if THEY refuse to follow
the rules that bind them?  All in all, such attitudes from our government
or those who have ever worked for it sounds like a good argument for
one having a policy of minimizing all traceable transactions.

And please tell us the logic as to why laws binding people must be kept
from them, and failing that, tell us why you cannot tell us.  Really,
the cloak-and-dagger bit tends to suggest one just doesn't know and
would rather not say so.  Nobody is asking for anything sensitive,
just public information (unless the 'law' has never been invoked, which
would make it irrlevant - laws not enforced because that would make
them known are kinda useless).

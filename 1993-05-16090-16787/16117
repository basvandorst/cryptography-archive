The concept of a connection mediated between two communicating entities by
a third party is the essence of connection-oriented network service
(CONS). Connection-less network service (CLNS), which is mandated by most
current US Government procurements, has as its underlying concept the
absence of an active third party. This necessarily makes encryption a
layer 7 function, to be negotiated by the two parties to the data
transfer. In CLNS, the packets making up the data transfer may pass over
multiple networks (some protected), and arrive at the receiver in
arbitrary order, via highly various routings.

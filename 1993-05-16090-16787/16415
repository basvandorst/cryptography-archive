And a front page article in the 4-26-93 MacWEEK, entitled "Security chips
trigger alarm".  They quote John Podesta, staff secretary to President
Clinton, on complaints that the encryption algorithm will remain
classified:  "We can't protect the key escrow features if we reveal the
algorithm to the public ... that's caused some heartburn.  I'm not
suggesting that the public should trust us any more than any other
government agency, but we are doing a more comprehensive review [than any
previous administration]."

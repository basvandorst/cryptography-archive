No flamage... just a comment... in the case of my alogrithm at least,
it allows infinite key lengths, which get wrapped back onto itself,
into a length of 11.  It is therefore possible to come up with any 11 byte
mapped password from an alphanumeric password.  So the keyspace has not
been reduced.  And it is and n to 1 where n -> infinity mapping.  
But, back to the point, every "real" key should be generatable by some
"rememberable" keys... so long as you allow arbitrarily long passwords, so
the x space is full (in theory although probably not in practice since people
will likely keep passwords under some given length... of course, they
could be clever and mix case, throw in some garbage... intermix words...
put in a control character in the middle of a word... of course any
user-generated-key based system is only as good as the key which means only
as good as the user).

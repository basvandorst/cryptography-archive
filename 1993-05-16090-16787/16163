   The concept of a connection mediated between two communicating entities by
   a third party is the essence of connection-oriented network service
   (CONS). Connection-less network service (CLNS), which is mandated by most
   current US Government procurements, has as its underlying concept the
   absence of an active third party. This necessarily makes encryption a
   layer 7 function, to be negotiated by the two parties to the data
   transfer. In CLNS, the packets making up the data transfer may pass over
   multiple networks (some protected), and arrive at the receiver in
   arbitrary order, via highly various routings. 

As Phil has pointed out, encryption can be handled at a variety of levels.
CLNS is basically similar to the IP level, and there are protocols
that do encryption between Layers 3 and 4.  Others do the 
encryption above Layer 4, typically as a Presentation Level protocol,
so the layer 7 stuff gets handed cleartext.  You can also
do it above Layer 7 (e.g. in a Mail User Agent or an encrypted telnet.)

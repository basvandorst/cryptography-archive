A VISA card, whether implemented with a magstripe or a smart card, 
does *not* represent "digital cash" -- which is what you claimed. And
an ATM "cash card" doesn't offer digital cash, either. Such cards 
allow you to perform banking transactions -- including the withdrawal
of cash -- when the bank is closed. That's all.

Sorry. A facility, however implemented, to allow you *access* to cash
cannot be described as "digital cash".

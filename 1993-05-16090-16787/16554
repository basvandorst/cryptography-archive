Well, just to clarify things, I dug out the source.  "Secret
Intelligence" by Ernest Volkman & Blaine Baggett ISBN 0-352-32528-3.
It's about the "Venona" intercepts, starts on p59. The following
passage describes it best I think:

" The errors were almost beyond belief. Code clerks, pressed by heavy
traffic, in some cases had used the same one-time pads repeatedly. In
other cases, apparently out of pads, they resorted to sending vital
intelligence in ordinary (and easily breakable) commercial code."

Apologies for breach of copyright :-)

BTW, the book is quite an interesting account of the early days of
the "intelligence" services in the US.

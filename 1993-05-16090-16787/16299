Thank you. On the face of it, that poses more queries than solutions. A 
fundamental of strong cryptography is that it is impervious to the analysis of 
intercepted signals, i.e. interception and analysis of ciphertext is not 
effective in the short or medium term for the recovery of plaintext. This, in 
turn, creates a stronger focus of offensive interest in the interception of 
plaintext signals before encryption or after decryption. Conversely, defensive
concern as to whether or not the the ciphertext is intercepted is reduced to 
devising methods of defeating or deceiving traffic analysis and the analysis 
of equipment and other operational signatures. 

Would you (or someone) be able to post the article you refer to? It would 
seem to warrant both dissemination and some discussion.

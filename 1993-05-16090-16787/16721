Some time ago, we put the full specs of our CDMA (spread spectrum)
digital cellular system up for anonymous FTP (on ftp.qualcomm.com,
in /pub/cdma/*.ps.z).

We did this largely to quash the concerns that a few members of the
standards committee to which we were submitting this spec had about
export controls (several members of the committee were not US
nationals.) We had already placed paper copies in the UCSD engineering
library, but it was the public distribution via FTP that finally
overcame the lawyers' concerns.

I think this says something about your claims.

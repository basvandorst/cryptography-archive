ObCrypto: 

I was speaking to a physics major friend of mine about group theory (which
I haven't studied yet) vis-a-vis encryption algorithms.  He didn't understand
anything about encryption.  After some discussion, I came to the following
conclusion, on which I would like comments regarding its accuracy:

Any algorithm which is a group is composed of invertible operations, which
map to an operation which is already in the group (and is therefore 
invertible.)  Therefore, if an algorithm can be shown to be a group, an
inverse exists, and is known (?)

Obviously it is bad if "one-way" hash functions or message digest functions
turn out to be groups, but is it bad if a private-key crypto function can be
shown to be a group?  It seems to me not, but I seem to recall reading
something to the contrary here in the past, although I can no longer find
the article.

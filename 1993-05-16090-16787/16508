There is a lot of new cypherpunk material on the CPSR gopher including
a discription of the "Clipper" chip by Arthur Abraham.

To access the whole gopher server, try
  gopher gopher.cpsr.org 70

Or, to see what's new in the last, say, 2 days, try the CAF whatsnew server:
  gopher -p"1/cpsr/2 days ago" gopher.eff.org 5070

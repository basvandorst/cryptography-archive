What a sec - this makes unauthorized tapping a piece of cake, right?  Lets
say one person (the "caller") phones another person (the "receiver"), using
MYK-78 for "security", and you want to listen in.  Just intercept the
signal from the caller, corrupt his LEF block (ie. change it to all zeros
maybe), then pass this along to the reciever.  When the receiver's data is
transmitted to the caller, do the same.  This shouldn't be tough - you
could splice into the phone line right by one of the two parties, and we
always know where the LEF blocks are, right?  (Otherwise, the law wouldn't
be able to access them.)  Now, both sides of the conversation will be
encrypted with a key of all zeros - may as well be unencrypted!

OK, what am I missing?  Must be something - this is TOO easy a back door.
You could fly the space shuttle through this sucker!

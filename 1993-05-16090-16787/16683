      Good idea, had it myself.

      A country that 'needs at least a little proof before throwing
you in jail' is not likely to be one that uses tourture.  Hay we do,
closed trials now, for 'National Security Reasions.'

      It does not require 'after everyone starts using it.'  All it
takes is for you to give them a second key.  At this point they will
allways have doubts about the number of keys, so you have do it to
yourself as soon as you get them key #2.

      This is not very usefull for a reporter.  If I were in a
country, as a reporter, and had some information I considered worth
my life - I would not encrypt it!  I would send in the clear, to as
many places as I could.  The idea being to get it out!

      Luck would be nessary, but it sure would help if the (PGP/no
decrypt key) system was widely known to be available, used and
effective.  If the county's information gathering orig. knew about
the system in advance of aquireing the reporter they would be much
more likely to beleve said reporter.

      And you can't have everything.  And with no outside support,
you are most likely to die an unplesant death in captivity in any
case.

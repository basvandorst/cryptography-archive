A question from a rank amateur:
	I thought that the problems with encrypting voice were the result of 
the massive amounts of redundancy in voice even after most forms of
compression. And that this redundancy and the large amounts of signal, gave
the ability of a plain text attack and periodicity?
	Am I wrong or is the threat minimal?

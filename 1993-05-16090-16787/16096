I am pretty sure that they would not collaborate. However, if it were so
easy to identify a drug dealer, the drug problem would no longer be a
problem, would it ?

Given the current paranoia against law enforcement agencies, it is likely
that it will be easier and easier for them to hide themselves under the
cover of << private life >> and cheat honest poeple in working for them
and  thus unwillingly helping then in their criminal activities.

How is it possible to fight organizations which are RICH, have no respect
for any rule other than theirs if the law enforcments agencies have no
source of information ? (wire tapping is one of them... access to banking
accounts in << fiscal paradises >> would be the best one).

Is it cost-effective? Perhaps not, as long as YOUR kid is not caught in
drug... Up to now, I have been lucky. Shall I ever be ? Will you ever be ?

hello, world!
I need some explanation about a FAQ. It's in part 4 : Mathematical cryptology,
in the part "What's a chosen plaintext attack ?".
Is is suggested to en crypt a plaintext P as
T,E_K(h(T+R+P),R,P) where T is a time-key.
Here comes my question : what is the interest of T? Why is this method better
than the following : E_K(h(R+P),R,P) ?

please answer by EMAIL!!!

thanks for wasting your time for a beginner!

According to the May 11, 1993 Federal Register (v. 58, n. 89, pp. 27713-
27715), the Secure Hash Standard has been approved.  It is now:  Federal
Information Processing Standards Publication 180, Secure Hash Standard.
The standard is effective Oct 15, 1993, which should give NIST plenty of
time to approve DSS.

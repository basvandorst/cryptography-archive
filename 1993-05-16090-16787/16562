I'm curious if anyone out there might know a bit about how the various
vendors accomplish this serialization scheme.

An example is SCO UNIX/Xenix.  The installation requires that you have
a serial number and an activiation key for the software to run.  

Similarly, INFORMIX has such a scheme which uses this.  The executables
will not run without a 'valid' serial number.

I'm not trying to crack anything, but am interested developing my own,
similar scheme for future projects.  I'd appreciate any help.

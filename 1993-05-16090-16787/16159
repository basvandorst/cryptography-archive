The answer to the question is No.  It is not even slightly secure.
The cryptoanalysis of the above problem is trivial:
Statistical analysis of cipher text with n arbitrary text filters
	(there are only a finite number of file-types, each can have 
	statistics easily compiled on them.  You simply try them all
	until you have a fit.)
will tell you the most probably key-length and will quickly solve
a one-to-one transformation, regardless of its type.
Any repeating cipher (Vigenere substitution) is solvable.

Sorry...

Ya, it must also "beggar credability" to suggest that a President is
a crook when he say he ain't. Or that the President knew about Iran-Contra
when he said he didn't. Or that a government-controlled organization would 
cheat the President ... or would look up "passport information" for the
President's benefit w/o his knowledge?

As far as I am concerned, there has been more Presidents caught lying
or telling half-truths then uncaught ones in at least the past 20 years.
Anyone who suggests something must be true because the President said 
so is a sucker in my book. Wake up! The government is not trustworthy.
How many private people you know that never broke [a serious] law?
How many goverment agencies stand to the same test?

David also suggests the NSA won't lie to the President because they have
too much to loose, etc. How do *you* explain Iran-Contra then?! (I know
the NSA had nothing to do with that one, this ain't the point.)

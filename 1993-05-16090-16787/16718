About DES, people should realize that a software realization of the
DES algorithm is not an implementation of DES. According to Numerical
Recipes, by W. H. Press et. al (Cambridge, Cambridge University Press,
1988), the DES standard states that only a hardware realization is an
implementation of DES. Does anyone know whether this is why the
Numerical Recipes Book, written in the U.S. and printed in the U.K.
doesn't get into import/export trouble over its DES code (there is no
notice of import/export restrictions in the book, nor on the order
form for the diskette). N.R. is not concerned with cryptography, but
uses DES as a random number generator.

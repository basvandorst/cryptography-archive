This is a situation where a simple repetition code is effective.  Simply 
encode each bit with a long string of repetitions of that bit.  Decoding 
requires only an approximate knowledge of the expected frequency.  If you 
estimate that 1/16 of the bits will be dropped, then a repetition factor of 
4 or 5 should be enough to unambiguously recover the original message with 
high probability.  If about half the bits will be dropped, a larger 
repetition factor would be required.  If the frequency is unknown and 
unbounded, this approach will not work.

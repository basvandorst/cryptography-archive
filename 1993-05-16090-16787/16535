There are companies that specialize in the reverse engineering
of integrated circuits, and ALL major IC foundries and design
houses have this capability to one extent or another.  These
people are miracle workers, and although NSA is fairly astute,
they can't claim to know more about semiconductor wafer fab 
than, say, Mitsubishi or Intel.  The real expertise in this
area is in the private sector, and much of it is in Japan.

There are trade rags for the wafer fab biz that I've seen over
the years where the author of a given article details the construction
of chips made by competing companies.  You don't think they got
that information by mail order, do you?

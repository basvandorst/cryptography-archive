  From the look of it, there are a few useful improvements (such as the
ability to encrypt binary files without having to stop and uuencode them),
but it still encrypts the message proper using DES (with the public key
applied in the usual fashion to encrypt the DES key and sign the message
digest).
  Given that 56-bit DES keys are just too short for really strong security,
I'd have to recommend a return to the drawing board.

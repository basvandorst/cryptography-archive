I believe the physical reverse engineering of chips, called "peeling", is
done commonly today. At least I have read articles describing various techniques
(using lasers, solvents, microscopes, etc). Regardless, an electron microscope
is hardly required! With an EM you could study the interface of an individual
junction in detail. Optical microscopes would be fine.

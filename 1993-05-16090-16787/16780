One method of cryptography of which I am aware is one-time-pad
cryptography. For those who haven't heard of it, it's a method by
which both sender and receiver keep a common set of random data.
The random data is fed with the message in basically a 1:1
ratio into a permutation algorithm to generate the cipher text.
The receiver takes the matched random data and the cipher text,
feeds them into a decoding algorithm, and gets the text back.

If I understand it properly, it obtains its strength from the
fact that the random data, rather than an algorithm, does
the scrambling (and the best pad data would come from a natural,
rather than algorithmic source). The name comes from the
traditional method by which pads of "key" are printed and as
each page is used it is destroyed to insure security (since
there would be no way to recover the key, it having been randomly
generated). Again, if I have the facts, this leads to one-time-pads
being especially useful for covert use since the algorithm would
be a simple one a person could do quickly, and yet the result is a
strong encryption.

Is my presumption correct -- that if one has a suitably random
and secure set of pads one could use something as simple as
an XOR or Caesar cipher on each pair of text and key bytes?

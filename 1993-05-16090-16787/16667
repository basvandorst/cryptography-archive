Will this work?

Using a PGP/Ripem type RSA device, is it possible to set up a
"group key" by the following method:

1. All members of the group are trusted.
2. All members of the group have the device.
3. All members have public-private key pairs.

If one of the members generates a public-private key pair, and
sends each other member (and everyone else) a copy of the 
group public key, and encrypts the private key and the password
using each members individual public key, and sends it to 
them. Is this secure?
Thanks,
Rudy

Pardon the intrusion, but does anyone know exactly how HyperCard generates its
random numbers, and if this is not random enough, does anyone know a source
for a good HyperCard random number generator function?

My guess is that it is based on the time of day, with some fractional second 
repeatability, i.e. if it splits the time into 60ths of a second, there are
60ths x 60 seconds x 60 minutes x 24 hours = 5,184,000 possible seeds, which 
is not nearly enough.

On its repeatability, a quick check shows no repeating in a 10,000 number 
sample.

Thanks,

	Wars are not the same as internal disturbances or revolutions.
	Where do you get this war business?  I am not talking about
	externally imposed (foreign) governments.  Obviously, these 
	do not depend on the cooperation of the governed in the
	slightest.  Modern industrial countries cannot function 
	with the sorts of conditions that prevail on the Gaza
	strip and they will disintegrate.

	Wars are won that way but internal struggles are different from wars.
	Governments that preside over modern economies cannot 
	impose conditions similar to the West Bank and Gaza and hope
	to keep the economy functioning.  A wrecked economy almost 
	always leads to a wrecked government sooner or later.

	Does France have an emperor now?  Eventually unpopular governments
	fall.  Not necessarily through military force.

	This is a case of foreign occupation which is more like war
	than revolution.

	Correct.  But it can only be effective if enough people cooperate
	with it.  Needless to say it may take time but I stand by my
	statement: 
		When a significant fraction of the population considers 
	       	its government the enemy even a totalitarian state cannot 
		endure.

	What do you suppose happened in the USSR?

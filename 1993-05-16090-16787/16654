Or you simply superencrypt everything in a strong cipher with
unescrowed keys before feeding it to the Clipper Chip, and decrypt
after Clipper decryption. This has the disadvantage of not being able
to exploit the Clipper chip's speed (since you have to encrypt
everything again, presumably in software).

But it does have the distinct advantage that if the government's
assertion is true that they could not decrypt Clipper without going
through the procedure to obtain escrowed keys, they could not detect
your use of super-encryption by mere casual snooping.

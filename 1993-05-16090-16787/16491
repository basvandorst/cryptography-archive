I can think of a simpler method: the waiter supplies them with three identical
pieces of paper, three identical pens, and a hat.  Each writes a `1' on his
piece of paper, if he paid for the meal, else `0,' and puts it in the hat.
The waiter then takes the three pieces of paper, and adds the numbers written
on them.  If the waiter says the sum is 0, then a government agency paid for
the meal; if he says the sum is 1, then one of the diners paid, and if he says
2 or 3, then the restaurant was trying to rip-off the diners.

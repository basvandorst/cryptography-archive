I assume that except for one-time pads, the NSA is much better at this
stuff than our adversaries. I can't prove it though, and if it's false, our
adversaries aren't going to tell us.

Part of the basis for my belief is that we have more people, spend much more
money, and have much better hardware than anyone else. NSA has had quite a
few years to benefit from these economic advantages in order to develop a
technology base that, one hopes, is the best in the world in this arena.

But I don't have any "inside" information.

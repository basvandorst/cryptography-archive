I think I'm catching the tail end of this argument, but ...

Reverse engineering an IC is in general fairly easy.  Areas that are
doped can be determined visually (through an SEM or even a visible
light microscope), as the dopant changes the refractive index.  Also
layers generally do not obstruct layers beneath them since they are so
thin that you can see through the higher layers.  Couple this with
basic knowledge of layout architecture and IC's can be reverse
engineered quite simply.  I imagine AMD reverse engineers Intel's
designs (not that they necessarily use them directly), and I'm sure
that government labs RE any foreign nation's high tech products.  I
had a friend that worked at one of the gov't labs which would tear
apart any fallen Soviet satellites to determine the state of their
art.  AND (one last thing), I remember seeing a 60 MINUTES episode
some time ago (>5 years) that did a story on the problem of the Asian
coast countries reverse engineering American chips and then reselling
them back to the US for less money.

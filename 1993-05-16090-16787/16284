For the purpose of argument, I presume that RSA's patent is valid (in the
US), and the PGP incorporates an algorithm covered by the patent.

I'm afraid we disagree on terms.  The program is not the patented device. 
(Text cannot be patented, and software is text.)  The patented device is
created when the program is run on a computer and executes one of the
patented algorithms.  Hence, even if the program is sold, a patented device
is NOT sold, (possibly) unless the seller also sells a computer.

Hence, we have the following dictionary of terms:

Patent term                real term in regard software
Manufacture                execution (probably of specific
                            section of code, but possibly 
                            execution of a program containing
                            the specific code.)

Use                        execution of specific code

Sale                       would be sale of a machine while it is
                            running pgp; selling access to a computer
                            running pgp; or selling an encryption service

Wrong.  (Well, correct for "object" patents, but not for "process"
patents.)  The infringement only occurs when the process is used.  Hence,
the only question in regard distribution of PGP is whether it would be
contributory infringement, in that it induces others (users of PGP) to
infringe RSA's patents.  I think the disclaimers I've seen quoted here
from the PGP documentation are adequate, but I'm not a lawyer.

Charging for distributing PGP is analogous to selling plans for producing a
patented device.  Construction of the device is not.

PGP is NOT A DEVICE.  How many times do I have to say that?

I haven't read the patent, but (1) if it only covers public-key encryption,
then using it with a non-public key would not be infringing; (2) if it
covers only encrypted messages, then using it for a file-encryptor would
not be infringing; etc.

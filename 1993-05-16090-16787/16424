Further to my posting re: NYT article on Clipper.

On Friday, 7 May and on Sunady, 9 May, John Markoff had two more very well
done articles in the NYT Business Section. 

With these three articles, a lot of very worthwhile material about clipper
and modern cryptlogy in general is being desseminated to the general public.
The Sunday article even has a few works to say about PGP.

The tone of all three pieces is not one that will warm the heart of those
pushing clipper. In fact, it looks very much like clipper has about as much
of working as all of the other Clinton bull shit. Maybe after he finishes
selling higher taxes, stimulus packages, health care packages, aid to Russia
and aid to Bosnia, he will hop on his bus and take his 'clipper initiative' 
show on the road and try to sell that to the people, who are turning
out to be not quite as stupid and gulliable as he thought.

For those who have not seen these articles, take a peek. If enough people
can't find them via local sources, I suppose I can post them to the net. Does anyone know, for sure, what the Copyright issues might be ? I suppose I'll
ring the Times and ask before I get into even more trouble.

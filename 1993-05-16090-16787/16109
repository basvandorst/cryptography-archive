In case anyone missed it in Denning's account of the Clipper system,
one essential aspect of it is:

The service provider will make the encrypted transmission avaiable
to the FBI black box. In short the service provider must have the
capability of isolating an individual's transmissions from all
others.

This is just the FBI Digital Network proposal in another form.
Aside from the fact that this proposal shows a complete ignorance
of the functioning of even today's network, it will severely hamper
(even cripple) current efforts to create a broadband network .
The possibility of the US functioning in the BISDN multimedia market
will become exceedingly remote.

I can hear the guffaws coming from Japan and Europe now, Goodbye to North
America's lead in telecommunications.

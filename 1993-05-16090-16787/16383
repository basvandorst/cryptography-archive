As for inducement to infringe: wouldn't the existence of a non-infringing
use be a defense? That was the result in the case of VCRs (although of course,
that dealt with copyright instead of patent infringement).

I'd have to go back and look at my license, but I believe I have a license
to use RSA for personal purposes, and I'm pretty sure that is REGARDLESS of
whether the RSA implementation is RSAREF or some other. IF that's true, then
my using PGP would not be a violation (and, as has been pointed out, it is
the act of using a computer program that would violate the patent, not the
act of writing a program, or even distributing it for a charge). That's a
pretty good defense against inducement to infringe, as I'm sure there are
many people who requested and received RSAREF along with a license to use
it.

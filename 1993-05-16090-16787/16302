This assumes that clipper's "signature" will be the same no matter
what data is encrypted using it.  It might instead be possible that
any voice waveform encrypted with clipper will be recognizeable as
such, and will look different from other binary data (eg, voice
encrypted with RSA) encrypted with clipper.

And I'm sure that monitoring your phone line looking for anything that
isn't (voice + clipper) will be ruled not to be search and seizure
(and thus not require a warrant), just as getting a list of who you
have been calling is not considered search and seizure.

Note: The above is entirely conjecture on my part.

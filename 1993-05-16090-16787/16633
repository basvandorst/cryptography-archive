Yes. Just assume the disk is backed up before, or made physically
write-protected. Then you reveal that you have something to hide,
when the original disk is different to the backup.
If you are talking about a large government that wants to find out
something, and want it badly enough, I guess they will find out, just
by asking you about the data, and not the keys, unless you die.
But if they want just to hide the information, well... the disk
will be junked, at least.

I see no way. Corrections welcome.

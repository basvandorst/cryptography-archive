       There is such legislation.  It's in the Arms Control Act.  I have
looked this up.  Look in the index to the USC under Arms Control.

       Basically, there are two complete independent systems of export
and import controls.  The general export control system is administered
by the Commerce Department, and, while a pain, can be dealt with.  There's
a separate system for "arms control", administered by State and Defense.
This controls the import and export of items listed on the "Munitions List".
The Munitions List (which is a real list, published in the Code of
Federal Regulations) lists all the items for which "arms control" applies.
Items like "battleships" and "rifles" appear.  Unfortunately, so does
"cryptographic equipment", because, when the Munitions List was created
decades ago, civilian cryptography barely existed.  Cryptographic
equipment is the only "dual use" technology covered under arms control,
and NSA has lobbied strongly to keep it that way.

       Importing or exporting "arms" is complicated.  Among other things,
you have to register as an "arms dealer" (Jim Bidzos of RSA had to do this).
Then, for each transaction, you have to open a "munitions case" with the
State Department.  The general assumption with regular export controls is
that you can export unless there's some explicit prohibition on doing what
you want to do.  The general assumption on arms controls is that you can't
export or import unless State and Defense like what you're doing.

       Operationally, arms controls are administered by the Director
for Munitions, Office of the Deputy Undersecretary for Trade Security Policy,
Office of Policy, DOD.  For information, contact their "Outreach unit",
703-697-7480.

       Exactly what current restrictions are I don't know.  But that's
where you find out.

Don't you mean "maximum available security" instead of "optimum"?
"Optimal" cares connotations of balance among considerations, including
cost.

The numbers waved about here have not shown that that smartcards would
be optimal.  If you take the VISA number of ~$50M, multiply by 4 to
get the real losses it as some here have said, and then multiply again
by 4 for having several companies, you don't get the claimed $B costs
of issuing smart cards.  Without knowing anything more than what has
been written in this newsgroup (as if it were possible to "know" anything
from netnews), the current dumb plastic sounds a lot closer to "optimal."

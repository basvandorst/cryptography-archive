We've been taught by Granpa Reagan that everything is a business; from
Governor Winthrop going on the lecture circuit in Salem comparing
witches to cuckoos to elevating murderers to celebrity status with
miniseries.  Yes, even appearing on the cover of Wired is good business.

Business. Exempt from most Constitutional guarantees of personal freedom;
its insinuation into the Great Ikon of our consciousness is a wonderful
painless way of gradually extinguishing freedoms, a slow venal drip.

The equivalent Constitutional coup in the nineties will be when the President
and Senate realize they can enact supreme law of the land by no
more than creating a treaty with some country: "I'm sorry.  Transmitting
unapproved encrypted messages is agains the law.  We have a treaty with
Iceland covering this just last year..."

Time to send copies of PGP to: (1) political and drug activists; (2) religious
splinter groups; (3) all reachable BBS in the country; (4) Opposition
political groups in other countries from Aruba to Zambia [with the correct
munitions license, of course :-)]

The only way you could stop the Samizdat then is to build in to every
CPU manufactured in the world crypto-blocking AIs.  (Researchers at
Georgetown, sparked at the suggestion at such efficient low-level
filtering, assure me that this is possible.)

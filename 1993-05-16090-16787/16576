In reading the material about the Clipper chip, it should be noted
that this is purely an encryption device. In order to *use* it in 
a secure(!) telephone application, there are many other aspects to be
considered. These include:
	
	Voice digitization/compression
	Session key establishment
	Encrypted channel protocol

Without all of these being specified, two clipperified telephone systems
from different vendors are unlikely to interwork. This is good news as
it means that it will be *less* likely for a single standard to arise -
this will cause there to be less systems to interwork with, and hence
a smaller market.

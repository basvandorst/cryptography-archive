Yesterday evening I was at a talk given by Anthony Sale who is manager of the
Science Museum's Historic Machines Programme (Computers and 
Telecommunications).  He is involved in a plan to set up a Museum of Cryptology
and Computing at Bletchley Park in Buckinghamshire, home of the 'Enigma'
decryption effort during WW2. They intend to restore the buildings to their 
wartime appearance and to build a working replica of the Colossus crypt-
analysis computer which was first used at Bletchley in 1943.

If you would like more information about the restoration of Bletchley Park,

"Hello.  Sternlight Escrow Agency, can I help you?"

"This is a list of keys we heard in law enforcement blocks whilst tapping the
phone lines of a suspected criminal."

"Hmm...  Well, since I have no database of keys and addresses, I'll have to
trust you that these are all plausible.  Here are the keys.  Oh, you will
promise to forget them once the investigation is over, won't you?"

"But of course."

"What if one of those keys belongs to the telephone of some innocent person
who allowed a friend to use his phone?"

"Then we won't listen to his conversations.  Trust us."

"What if he claims he didn't let the bad guys use his phone?"

"Can he prove he didn't?  We have evidence that he did.  We've a list right
here, and his phone's ID is on it.  Who are you going to believe, honest
God-fearing men like us, or a man who openly consorts with criminals?"

"What if some of those keys belong to people who phoned the bad guys
unwittingly?"

"Then obviously we won't listen to their conversations either.  Trust us."

"Hmm... Yes, I'm convinced.  Have a nice day."

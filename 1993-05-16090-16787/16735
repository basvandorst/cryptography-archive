True.  That was before the advent of digital signatures.  Validation of 
software would make no sense, since there could be no confidence that
there was any correspondence between what was validated and what was
sold or used.

Mostly true but irrelevant.  

In those days, most computers were "untrusted" multi-user machines.  The 
problems of managing keys in such and environment appeared to be
intractable, at least for national security applications.

All of that having been said, hardware-only was a concession to NSA's
fear of loss of control.

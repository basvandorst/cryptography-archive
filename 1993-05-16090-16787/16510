For the usual UNIX-Systems this is public knowledge:
The password may contain up to 8 characters. Bit 7 (=128) of all
characters is ignored. A random salt of twelve bits is created.
The original password is put through DES 25 times, where one permutation
in DES is disturbed by the salt. (The 56-bit-password serves as key
to this encryption, the data is all 0) The salt is the first two
characters in /etc/passwd, the ouput of DES the next 11 characters.
The password entry in etc/passwd consists of 12 bit salt and 64 bit
encrypted pasword.
There are other encryption-shemes for Ultrix machines, and a whole
bunch of other systems for other OS...
Sources are widely available for the std-unix passwd-crypt.

Hope this helps,

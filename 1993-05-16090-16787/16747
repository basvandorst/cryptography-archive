     Unsecured, non-authenticating systems are a standing temptation
for those antisocial types who go breaking into computer systems
around the globe.  Attacks from such machines can, at best, be traced
to those machines.  There is generally no clue whatsoever as to the
identities of the culprits.  Consequently, such machines, be they pee
cees or terminal servers (e.g. Annexes), are usually restricted to
direct access only within the administering organization, provided
that organization is a responsible member of the Internet community.
Our institution wishes to be a responsible member of the Internet
community and therefore requires that users of unsecured, non-authen-
ticating hosts who wish to access the resources of other institutions
first log into an authenticating host at our institution, from which
they can proceed with what they wish to do.
     There is further an unresolved issue of legal liability.  If we
configured our campus network such that a malicious person, perhaps
not even associated with our university, could just walk into a lab
on campus and use a pee cee to break into, say, a banking or brokerage
system, would our university be liable for damages on grounds of
negligence or perhaps something else?  If the victim were in another
country and significant damage were done, what would be the ramifica-
tions both politically and under international law?  We don't know,
but we also don't want to be so irresponsible toward the rest of the
net as to provide the test case.

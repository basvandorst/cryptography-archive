Shortly after posting my message, I realized that my `solution' does not
really solve the problem.  The key question, which is partially identified in
Mr. Epstein's message, is that some person must be trusted to handle the slips
without giving out the information as to the origin of each slip.  In other
words, he must vouch that the three messages did indeed originate with the
three cryptographers, but not reveal from whom each message originated.

In my solution, it is actually the hat (and the indistinguishability of the
slips of paper) which achieves this.  So the waiter can be eliminated, and one
cryptographer (or all of them) could examine the slips in the hat.

However, I cannot see what could play the role of the information-destroying
hat if the messages were being communicated electronically.  In that case, one
would indeed have to resort to the more complicated scheme involving the XOR
of coin tosses.  In this scenario, the originator of each message is known,
but the messages themselves have too little information to allow the donor (if
any) to be identified.

   I don't buy the argument that the NSA doesn't want to publish skipjack for
fear that our enemies will get it.  If skipjack is implemented in commercially-
available products that are mass-marketed, then they *will* be reverse-engineer
ed by people in the employment of major adversaries of the US.
   Perhaps they don't want to publish it because they don't want US/foreign
citizens using such a strong algorithm....

And (3) the LEF may be repeated -- not literally, but in modified form -- 
during the transmission. With at least partial knowledge of the protocol 
and the algorithms it would be possible to verify if the original LEF 
matches the rest of the transmission. If not, the line could be inter-
rupted automagically, or at least a red flag could be waved ...
(Otherwise it would be possible to replace the LEF by a pre-recorded 
value which had been used by some other arbitrary cripple chip.)

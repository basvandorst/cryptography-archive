I thought I included a power table in the original post....

were looking at).

I'll try to remember to check this when I get home tonight (notes
are at home; I leave on vacation tomorrow).  If I did make a 
transcription error, I apologize.  

(After bitching about how most of our problems set had at least one
typo in them this would be _extremely_ embarassing!)

BTW, you didn't need to figure out the possible keys to decrypt
the message.  I started to, then realized it wasn't important --
the system could be cracked without knowing the key(s).

Yes.

Yes.  I used matrix notation, but this is equivalent.

I was using the smallest positive power of a particular solution to
a polynomal in GF(2^3).  It makes multiplication much simplier -- you
just add the exponents modulo phi(2^3).  Your notation requires a
full multiplication table -- easy in GF(2^3), not so easy in GF(2^8).

Yes.

>Have fun.

I actually did have fun on this problem.  Very strange, since it
was on my final...  :-)  Of course, I did get an "A" in the class.

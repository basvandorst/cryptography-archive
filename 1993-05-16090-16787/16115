Precisely.  According to Feynman, the Challanger commission was
stacked with people who wanted nothing more than a quick, quiet end to
the investigation -- people who wanted to avoid "rocking the boat".
Hand-picked stoolies.  Feynman (according to Feynman) was the

demonstrating that we should trust a so-called independant commission. 

I doubt the NSA will make the same mistake.

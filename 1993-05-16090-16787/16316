   Teleportation by Quantum Menage a Trois?

   The seemingly science fiction Star Trek quality to the following has 
   practical applications to cryptography and secure untappable command-
   control-communications in military technology (e.g., submarine, combat 
   battle-field and deep space), computer-assisted financial transactions, 
   personal privacy etc. It is no accident that Charles H. Bennett, one of the 
   key physicists, works for IBM Watson Research Center. Can this new 
   "teleportation" may allow us to break the speed of light barrier in the 
   transfer of information between different space regions of a computer?  
   Ignoring these physics developments may be catastropically disastrous for 
   world-wide political and financial stability ten years from now.  Certain 
   large corporations now in the fore-front of high technology can find 
   themselves out in the cold.  [etc.  much stuff mercifully deleted]

	Say what?
	Didn't you use to hang out at the alt.sci.physics.new-theories
board?  What on earth does this have to do with cryptology.  People,
correct me if I am wrong.  The crux of cryptology is the ability to
use a uniquely invertible function to apply to text.  Since the function
is uniquely invertible, after f(Key)(text) is applied, then f(inverse)encoded
text returns f(text)  {excuse me, this would be clearer if I could use 
subscripts}.  If text is scrambled randomly, then how do you unscramble
it?  
	I'll admit, I'm not sure whether you are serious or not, or
whether I really understand whatever the hell you are talking about.
I think you have rediscovered a new cypher technology called incoherence.

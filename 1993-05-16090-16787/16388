How can you obtain the random component from an mixed random and
non-random source?

Specifically, in order to generate a truly random OTP, you connect a
Soundblaster card to an FM radio tuned to no signal. The white noise is
digitized by the SB card to serve as a starting point for OPT generation.

There is a "truly random" component in the digital data so obtained. But
there is an awful lot of repetative stuff as well, so that it wouldn't be
useful as a one time pad.

Some thoughts on how to filter out the non-random stuff are:

   Compress the data and throw away the header (initial table) and thus
   remove a lot of non-random sequences.

   XOR the compressed string with a transposed version of itself and smear
   away remaining non-randomness. (?)


I suspect there is a better way to do this. Any ideas?

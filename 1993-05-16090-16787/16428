Or better yet, an SPDIF munger that takes the output from an
analogue-to-digital converter recording, say, the Grateful Dead playing
a concert basement and replaces the bottom bit with one derived from a
true random source.  This could then be written to a DAT or a CD-R (but
not DCC or MD, of course).  People pass Grateful Dead tapes around all
the time.  Dithering the bottom bit with true Random Noise will do the
sound no harm at all.  The one-time pad can be recovered with the
inverse operation.

I've often wondered why the former WarPac countries exported cheap CDs.
Maybe this is the reason...

Surely here you have to ensure that the only people who have access to
the identities of the people in question is themselves and a safe
haven back home---in other words the individual contributors
anonymously contribute their statements encrypted in the public key of
the safe base.  Only after returning to the safe base can the accounts
be regenerated, so the `bad guys' can only compromise the system by
either catching the contributors in the act, or compromising the
security of the home base (which is in another country).  The
contributors have to trust the validity of the journalist in providing
the correct public key of course...

It's important to be quite clear that export and import controls on
publically-available / public-domain software do not exist.  The
following extract from "Defense Trade Regulations" from Federal Record,
March 26, 1992 (formerly International Traffic in Arms Regulations, or ITAR):

> Sec. 120.23 Technical data.
> 
>     Technical data means, for purposes of this subchapter:
> 
>     (c)  *Software* as defined in Sec. 121.8(f) directly related to defense
> articles;
> 
> Sec. 125.1 Exports subject to this part.
> 
>     (a)  The  export controls of this part apply to the export of technical
> data and the export of classified defense articles. Information which is in
> the  ''*public* domain'' (see Secs. 120.19 and 125.4(b)(13)) is not subject
> to the controls of this subchapter.

If anybody disagrees, please state clearly which regulation of which agency
restricts the import or export of publically-available / public-domain
software.  I've spent hundreds of dollars in free-text searches of the
Federal Record, and can't find any such restriction.  Comments akin to
"Joe Blow of company X once told me that his lawyer cousin told him that
you couldn't do Y" don't really cut it.

In addition, the following partly describes the restriction on importing
cryptographic equipment, which clearly is covered by the U.S. Munitions
List.  I guess the Treasury Department will protect us from importing
these dangerous weapons <sarcasm alert>:

> Sec. 120.5 Relation to regulations of other agencies.

Lastly, it's really amusing to see how even a big company like DEC can
get so caught up in this kind of foolishness.  I was in Siberia all week
last week (Novosibirsk) and logged into gatekeeper.dec.com to test Internet
connectivity.  It was a bit tricky because routing was messed up, but it
was no problem to transfer anything from gatekeeper.dec.com to Russia.
There is a silly "EXPORT CONTROL NOTE" included on the login screen,
which is so clearly ridiculous that it must have been written by an
army of DEC's lawyers.  This note, included below, not only is incorrect,
but if I can get in from Russia, where can't I get in from?

Of course, nobody in Russia is at all interested in getting any DES software
from DEC - the better archives of cryptographic software are in Finland.

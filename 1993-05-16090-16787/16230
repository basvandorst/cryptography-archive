One of the key parts of today's nad tomorrow's network will be the private
network. A company will lease a portion of bandwidth from one of many
(or several of them) service providers and then multiplex its own
transmissions onto this bandwidth. The service provider is only responsible
for providing a clear path on this link, it will have no knowledge of the
switching, multiplexing, addressing, compressing, encrypting, etc
which the client will use on it.

Now if the telco cannot isolate criminal transmissions since they
are hidden in the normal stream, who is going to do it? Suppose
a crooked bank is laundering money for some drug dealers. They will
just communicate over their private network with their own addressing
and multiplexing. Now is the FBI and Dorothy Denning going to ask this
bank to send all criminal transmissions off to some black box in
Washington?

Clipper is unworkable to tap organized criminality. However Clipper
as a means of enforcing the FBI Digital Network Proposal is ingenious.
The3 FBI has trouble tapping private networks. The FBI sees that
BISDN networks will become even more diffcult (if not impossible)
to tap. The solution is simple. Make such networks uneconomic by imposing
impossible regulations.

Keep the North American network firmly entrenched in the 1970's. The
Europeans and the Japanese will gladly develop the next generation
network for us.

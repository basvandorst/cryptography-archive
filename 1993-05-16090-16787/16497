   If the NSA actually used the same chip in all of their top-secret
   communications, *that* would make me feel a lot better for its
   security.  That's a good idea anyway... it would prevent the NSA and
   other government agencies from holding secrets back from the rest of
   the government.

This is true only if the keying data is simple.  One expects that, on
the contrary, the keying data consists of essentially a program for a
relatively general purpose cryptography engine.  So, this is a little
like saying it's ok for us to be using DES on our machines, while the
NSA uses the latest of their cryptography systems, because, after all,
they both can run on IBM PCs.

There has also long been the suspicion that some NSA cryptosystems
have keys with sufficient internal structure that it is statistically
unlikely to choose a strong key, and that most keys chosen without
knowing the algorithm are weak.  Note that this strategy guarantees a
role for a central key distribution authority, and ameliorates the
difficulty of having strong crypto hardware falling into the hands of
potential adversaries.  One might surmise that Skipjack has some of
these features.

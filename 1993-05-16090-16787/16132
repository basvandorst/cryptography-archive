It's not at all secure.  Ordinary random number generators aren't
designed for this sort of usage, and their parameters can easily
be recovered from a small segment of the "random number" stream.
(See Knuth section 3.6, excercise 7, and references therein.)
This segment can be obtained from (eg) probable-word guessing,
or more generally any of the usual known-plaintext attacks.

(You should also beware of exhaustive search if the parameter
space isn't large enough.)

If you had a "cryptographic random number generator", for which
the parameters weren't easily recoverable from the output stream,
then such a system might be a useful cryptosystem.  But *good*
cryptographic RNGs are hard to design (just like any other good
cryptosystem).

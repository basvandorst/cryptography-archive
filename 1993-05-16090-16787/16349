FIPS-140 'General Security Requirements for Equipment using the Data 
Encryption Standard' (originated by the Communications Security Organization,
National Security Agency, 9800 Savage Road, Fort Meade, MD 20755) specifies
two methods of key variable entry approved, one of which is manual entry.  

Any visual residue shall be removed automatically after is is accepted
as valid.

After initial key loading, all unencrypted key variables shall be stored
inside DES cryptographic equipment, in order to receive the protection
associated with the security requirements of this standard.  A means must
be provided to assure that the unencrypted key variables cannont visually
or electrically be read out of DES cryptographic equipment.

Once the key is entered it is blanked from the display, never to be
seen again.

A skipjack or clipper version of this document will undoubtably be
promulgated to clipper equipment manufacturers.  The major differences
would be for size of the key, and maybe the physicals of the key
injector to remove compatibility with DES key injectors.

Because it is a FULL DUX (duplex) clipper chip, The encryption test can
consist of method 1, where two key generators are used to encrypt
the same plaintext and have their outputs compared.  This keeps
you from doing having to do algorithm checks (S-Box test, Checkword test),
and revealing algorithm information to manufacturers.  Thus you will never 
see a HALF DUX clipper chip, and method 2 will not be presented.

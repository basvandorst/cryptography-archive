Many citizens of the United States have strange ideas about 
wars, and seem to think that a war is a kind of referendum where 
the side that gets the most votes wins.  For example, 
in article <1993May19.211055.19170@news.eng.convex.com>, 
gardner@convex.com (Steve Gardner) writes:

It would be nice if this were so; but even the most unpopular 
totalitarian state can hold out if the revolutionaries are unable 
to match them in military methods.  Sadly, wars are won by guns and not 
by votes.  

Two examples spring to mind:-
(A) In France in 1815, the Restoration was widely despised, but 
    survived numerous attempts at a new Revolution by using what 
    we would call secret police to stop the (very popular) revolutionaries 
    from succeeding.
(B) When Israel occupied the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1967, virtually 
    all of the population in those territories opposed the situation, but 
    effective crackdowns prevented an uprising for two decades. 

The necessary conditions for a revolution are:-
1   The majority of the population agrees with it;
  PLUS!
2   The government (to be overthrown in the revolution) is not effective
    at preventing the revolution.  

It's not enough that the government must be universally unpopular; it must 
also be unable or unwilling to stop the revolution by non-democratic methods.

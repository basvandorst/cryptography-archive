More to the point, Feynman pointed out that NASA was not the agency of old
-- the one who put us on the moon.  He kept encountering bad engineering,
bad science and lack of understanding -- technical management by hacks,
etc.

I've been wondering.

Strong crypto has been in the hands of private citizens for about 4000
years (according to "The Codebreakers" by Kahn).  Since at least 1500 AD,
there have been official government cipher agencies.  Why does this
proposal to surrender keys come up only now, for the first time in history?

Well, there are a few possibilities -- but I'd sure like someone like
Feynman to ask and answer that question.

--BEGIN PURE FICTION--

For those who like to speculate, our signals intelligence community (like
the FBI's) is slightly larger than the Pope's cipher bureau in 1550.  It
might even be large enough to be called a bureaucracy and to be managed by
the kind of people you wouldn't invite to a dinner of fellow scientists.
Everyone knows that such people (and such an organization) have one rule:
continue to exist, grow, ....  They may not be very good at getting results
the normal way, but they're really dedicated to increasing their budgets.
Now, along comes the cold war.  Great!  Big budgets.  Then, there goes the
cold war.  Oops.  What do we do now?  Aha!  We have a war on drugs -- apply
all this SIGINT to the civilian population.

--END PURE FICTION--

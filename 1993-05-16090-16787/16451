Hi!

With all the talk currently going on about Clipper/Skipjack, does
anyone know anything about the RAMBUTAN system being adopted for
"approved use" in the UK?  I presume that it's a secret algorithm
:-(, but was wondering if anyone has had any experience with it.

BTW, all of the systems I've seen that use it require GCHQ-generated
key material :-{

TIA!

Nik

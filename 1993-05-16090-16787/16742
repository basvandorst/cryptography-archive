I have made available for anonymous FTP a revised version of
Manber and Wu's agrep 2.0.4 (approximate grep) ported to Macintosh
MPW 3.2.3.  'Best match' option and 'read patterns from file' (-f)
option now functional.
 
Available from:

Uses in cryptography include screening passwords for sufficient
dissimularity from contents of word and phrase lists and
in signals intelligence for screening large (~30,000) watch lists
against spool directories at sublinear speeds.
 
 
For example, as a password screener (to make sure a prospective
password or phrase is not too close to a dictionary word or phrase):
 
agrep -w -2 'plu4gh' scrabblewords
 
produces:
 
>plough
>plug
>plugs
>plunge
>plush
>pugh
 
 
 
Or more prosaic use as a 'suggesting' spelling checker:
 
agrep -w -B 'souxp' scrabblewords
 
produces:
 
>best match has 1 error, there is 1 match
>soup
 
Includes 'man' page; augmented internal usage summary.

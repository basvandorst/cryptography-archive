I don't remember the details of the patents themselves sufficiently to
determine what an infringement is.  I _think_ the patent(s) in question
only cover encrypted communication (or possibly digital signatures) using
the specified algorithms, so that sending  (with intent to send?) an
encrypted message would be an infringement, although they couldn't prove it
without obtaining the decryption key.

I want to add, for PKP's benefit, that I have no intention of using any
encryption scheme here at Beckman without having it cleared by the
company's lawyers.  (What I do on my home machine is another matter.)

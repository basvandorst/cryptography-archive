This week's Science has a paper on a CAT scanner with 1 micron
resolution.  (I haven't seen the paper itself, just a news report.)

But to physically open up the chip, probably the best way is to
go in through the back, and grind it down until you can
see the active layers.  (Astronomical CCD image sensors are
often thinned this way, so that they have higher sensitivity when
illuminated from the rear, where the light can go through pure silicon
instead of the metal etc. electrodes.)

Anybody who uses the word 'tamperproof' is trying to fool someone,
(possibly himself.)

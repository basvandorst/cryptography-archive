Amen. This has been bugging me too for quite some time. The credit card
companies couldn't care less about the costs of fraud that they don't have
to bear directly, even though they're the only ones in the position 
to virtually end it with smart cards.

Not only do they not care about the costs incurred by merchants (the ones
who don't verify sales or actually have the card in hand when they do),
but they also don't seem to care about the ease with otherwise smart
young people can ruin their lives by "carding" and getting caught.

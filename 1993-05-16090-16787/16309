   1.  If so, what prevents someone who knows my public key from using
   it to derive my private key?

Keys are generated in pairs.  You generate BOTH keys at the same time.
It is based upon the fact that you cannot factor large numbers very
quickly.  If someone could derive your private key from your public
key, then they must know something about factoring numbers that no one
else does... ;-)

   2.  What mechanism is preventing someone who knows my public key
   from decrypting plain-text encoded with that key by using the
   reverse of the encryption algorithm?  Or is this math way beyond
   my mortal talents?

The encryption function is a one-way function: exponentiation within
the group of integers mod N (N is the large number that they would
need to factor to break your key).  Basically, its computationally
infeasible to reverse this process.

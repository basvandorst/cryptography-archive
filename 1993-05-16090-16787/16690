   FEAL is a feistel-type cipher designed in Japan.  I don't have the
references in front of me, but I can tell you a bit:
 
   FEAL is a feistel-type cipher, like DES.  This means that the input
block is split into a left and right half, then each round of encryption
calculates some nonlinear function of the right half and part of the key,
XORs it into the left half, and swaps the right and left half.  The non-
linear function in FEAL depends on addition of 8-bit numbers mod 256, which
isn't all that strong.
 
               One round of a Feistel-type cipher:
 
                     L = L XOR F(R,K_i)
                     SWAP L,R
 
   The original FEAL has a 64-bit key.  Biham and Shamir wrote in Crypto 90
that FEAL with less than 32 rounds is breakable by differential cryptanalysis
faster than a brute-force keysearch.  They detail an attack on FEAL in
Eurocrypt '91.  There is also a statistical attack on FEAL-8 in Crypto 90,
which seemed to be strongly related to differential cryptannalytic techniques,
but I haven't read the article just yet.
 
   There is an extended version of FEAL called FEAL-NX (N = # of rounds).
Biham and Shamir wrote that it was no harder to break that FEAL-N.

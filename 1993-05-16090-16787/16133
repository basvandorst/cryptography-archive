a) as a Clipper programmer ( an Xbase language) I resent the naming of this
	chip.

b) I DONT GET IT!???
	1) suppose the clipper chip is for law enforcement purposes.
	   i.e. find the bad guys.
	2) if you are a bad guy, do you use a police radio to talk to
	    other bad guys?
	   in less than a day, with net access you could get prob'ly 
	10 different encrytion schemes right? 
	   your local library probl'y contains a similar number....

	So even if the govt BANS all other schemes..(cant be done)

	they'll catch all the dumb crooks? and leave a huge capacity 
	for the govt to abuse their privilages....



	Please excuse my spelling. and poor formatting. and confusion.
	They're the government, they must know what their doing...
		but do we?

That sounds like a back door if I've ever seen one.  All someone needs to do
is mess with the LEF when it is transmitted, set their Clipper to decode all
zeros, and they have instant access.  If this is true, that engineer may
have accidently given more information than Uncle Sam wanted people to know.

What's really cute is that the clipper does not indicate an error.  It
seduces the unsuspecting target into think that they have a secure channel
so they may reveal more information than if they just had a convential phone
connection.  Having NO protection is better than faulty protection, because
then you will not reveal secrets because you know your connection is

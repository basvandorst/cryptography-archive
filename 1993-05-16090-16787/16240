I agree, Clinton is not yet Richard Nixon.  But, he seems to be trying
to be LBJ.

Clinton has shown, so far, a penchant for secrecy.  Consider Hillary's
Health Group.

The Wall Street Journal is _still_ trying to figure out who these 500 people
are.  No one knows (the default seems to be "a bunch of government policy
wonks/bureaucrats" but that seems largely out of frustration.  They are not
the heads of major hospitals, the head of the AMA, the pharmaceutical industry
and other "special interests" who also happen to actually _deliver_ our health
care.  They are faceless somebodies meeting in secret.  Not my first choice as
a way to redesign 15% of the US GNP).  Government by secret deliberation (not
always an evil), secret society (definitely an evil), and by trial balloon.

Now consider the Clipper proposal.  Another government initiative deliberated
_in secret_ by who knows whom (sure, the NSA, but who else?) and simply
delivered to the body politic and expected to be implemented, with the appearance
of a public debate, but actually all the decisions (so far as the government
hopes) already made, with no public discussion of the social trade-offs other
than in politically powerless placers like Internet.

Nixon is in a class by himself, but we forget at our peril that LBJ seemed
not to be beyond a few dirty tricks (or, at least, a hankering to do it).  His
"arm twisting" was reputed to be based, in part, on secret knowledge of a
congressman's weakness (with, to be fair, a keen skill at ladling on the pork, 
which is hard to call corrupt in the sense we're discussing).

Where Clinton falls remains to be seen, but he is famously pro-government and
so is likely to think that the government can do anything, especially keep
important secrets.  I've seen no hint that he worries at all about government
fallibility.  I'd be delighted to be proven wrong, but I don't see it yet.

I think we're seeing the beginning of a bad trend:  Government is good and
able to do whatever it sets itself out to do and executive secrecy is OK, since if
we let the "special interests" in on the deliberations, the executive might
actually have to consider the ideas of those affected by the decisions and that
would lead to "gridlock" (a public debate) instead of victory for the "activists"
(who want to do a particular something).

On the issue of how to obtain an authenticated

I haven't seen the article yet, but with the minimal assumptions
that

(1) There are no time servers that are trusted;
(2) Any or all of the time servers may be working in concert

Is does seem hard to imagine how you could get a valid time-stamp.
("valid" in the context of the conditions above means that you
can obtain a time-stamp(s) with arbitrary high probability that it
matches a golden time-standard that you can only occasionally check.)

Given that one's whole definition of what is 'reality' comes from 
these untrusted servers, it seems convincing myself or a third party
that my time-stamped document is correct still seems impossible
(at least with arbitrary high probability).

So -- before I read the Stornetta/Haber article -- what must be
my revised minimum assumptions in order to get a valid time certificate?

I can see that if there exist time servers that I trust even a
tiny amound above zero, then if I can get enough different time-stamp
certificates I can accumulate any level of trust.  But if they can
work in concert to fool me, then even this seems impossible.

I came up with the opposite notion the other day:

If you have an ISDN phone and a CD player with some level of
software control and bits out, you can scramble your voice
comm via your favorite CD.  This is, of course, private-key
encryption using the infamous one-time pad with 
not-very-random numbers.  But key distribution is done for 
you by the music industry.  All you have to do is agree
which CD beforehand or at the beginning of the call.

Silicon Graphics CD-ROM drives have full digital sound I/O;
SUN I think will have the same (Sony) drives soon.  Actually,
you just need to input and monitor the track and second counters.
Standard consumer $100 CD players should work with a few simple
mods.

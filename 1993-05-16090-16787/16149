: Actually, I base my views on rational principles. I probably know a lot
: more, in detail, about overflights, government wiretapping, and other such
: behavior than you do. I was a working professional during the Berlin Tunnel
: flap, the many cookings of data and outright falsehoods to get more money
: for the defense budget, Lyndon Johnson's lying to the American people (I
: served with a White House Commission in the Johnson Administration, whose
: purpose was to do something about unemployment in America's urban ghettos,
: and I could tell you stories that would curl your hair about the White House
: then), Nixon, Agnew, etc. etc.

Could someone send me another box of lineprinter paper please?  I'm running
out of room for David's excellent resume' :-)

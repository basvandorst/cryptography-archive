Security in cryptography isn't a matter of $ and hardware.  It is a matter
of brains, discipline and loyalty.

The Russians have a much better tradition of serious mathematics than the
US.  We seem to import ours.  Inasmuch as Russia, for example, can do
anything with 486's that NSA can do with Crays (it takes more of them,
of course, but the total cost is lower), and a Russian manpower budget buys
lots more brains for less money, I wouldn't assume NSA is way ahead.

As for loyalty, it is probably a toss-up.

However, I would go set up an R&D lab in Russia if I wanted to do serious
development of new cryptographic techniques, not Harvard.

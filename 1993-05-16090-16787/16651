(This discussion belongs in talk.politics.crypto, a group for ``the
relation between government and cryptography.'' As you can see, this
group doesn't exist---yet. I do not want to handle the RFD and CFV for
this. Loose ball; somebody pick it up, please. Thanks.)

Let me preface my comments with the disclaimer that I am currently
unable to speak in public about a number of issues highly relevant to
this discussion. What I say below is necessarily incomplete.

The ITAR does say that information in the ``public domain'' is not
subject to any ITAR control. The ITAR defines ``public domain'' in a
certain specific way. The ITAR definition of ``public domain'' does not
cover a document which I have just created, even if I waive all copying
rights to that document, and even if I intend to hand-deliver a copy of
the document to every mailbox in the known universe. It covers only
certain types of ``published'' information. The ITAR does not define the
word ``published.''

Let me repeat that: The ITAR does _not_ define the word ``published.''

As this is an absolutely critical point, let me repeat it once more:

******** The ITAR does _not_ define the word ``published.'' ********

At my last check with the NSA and the State Department, ITAR was still
current. The quotes which Ed gives, although not substantially
misleading, are simply not correct, and it is easy to draw certain
incorrect conclusions from his article.

Sorry to be so vague.

	In response to a message distinguishing key escrow from back doors (both are
	terms of art with specific meanings), some have asserted that there is a
	back door. It seems to me that those who assert that are making it up out of
	whole cloth. There's actually more evidence that the earth is flat. :-)

No David, from the description of the key generation algorithm published
you'll see tha the user's key is entirely determined from the chip's serial
number and two seed numbers.  The seed numbers are the back door.  If they
weren't the back door, random bits from a particle counter or an ultra high
speed unstable flipflop would be used instead.

PS If someone knows the private key from one chip in a batch, and the
serial number, can they reverse engineer the S1 and S2 for the whole batch?

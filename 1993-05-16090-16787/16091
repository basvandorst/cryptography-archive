I'd be even more satisfied if they'd publish the names of the experts that
they call in to examine the algorithm.  Hopefully they'll include people
that we (the public) can rely on to be earnest (but impartial) in their
examination.

What comes to mind is the group that was gathered to investigate the shuttle
explosion a few years back.  We need someone like Feynman on the comission
that will study this algorithm.

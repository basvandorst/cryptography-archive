A nice analysis, but I don't think "direct access" is needed.
Why not have the IC CAD tools generate a block of circuitry
which looks for a "trigger" pattern on the crypto input port?
Then someone in the middle of the connection can send the
trigger pattern, which causes the chip to send the session key
on the output port (or go into some other mode useful to the
cryptanalyst).  A pattern about 80 to 100 bits long would
almost never occur accidently, and if it did, it would just
look like a transmission hit to the user.

To prevent such a backdoor, the committee of experts will
have to continuously verify that the actual production masks,
in combination with the actual production programming,
implement ONLY the described, classified algorithm.  Proving
this negative will be difficult;  especially since sample chips
cannot be reverse engineered to check the production.

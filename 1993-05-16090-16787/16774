Having said that, I'm curious about something:
 
How secure is the encryption PGP uses on its key rings?  If someone gets 
ahold of your encrypted secret keys, how much effort would they have to 
expend to break that encryption?  In other words, how much of a risk are 
you taking if your encrypted secret key is more or less a publically 
accessable file?
 
Assume that the pass phrase is a "good" pass phrase, and not something 
easy to guess.  I generally use an English phrase, with some of the words 
intentionally spelled incorrectly (transpositions or outright 
misspelling).  I'd also like to know if this pseudo-English much weakens 
the security -- if going to outright random letters would make it 
a lot more secure it might be worth spending a few minutes memorizing.

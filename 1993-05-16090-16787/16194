Capstone is the propietary government chip that will incorporate the Skipjack
encryption algorithm, DSA digital signatures, and SHA harshing.  Simmons'
subliminal channel paper shows how to embed secret information into a digital
signature such that no one (except those who know a special, secret key) can
read the information--in fact, no one can even know it is there.

Here's a chilling scenario.  What's to stop the NSA from embedding all (or
part of, depending on the bandwidth limitations) of your Skipjack key in the
DSSA signature?  All the algorithms are incorporated into one chip.  There is
NO WAY you can tell if they are doing so.  Only someone who knows the
subliminal channel key can recover the subliminal information; to everyone
else it just looks like a conventional signature.

I'd like a show of hands...who trusts NSA not to do this?  Who is sufficiently
paranoid to think that NSA will do this?

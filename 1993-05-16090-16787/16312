I doubt this meta-observation is really correct.  Leaving aside the
issue of whether Liberatarians are really on the right or left (some
claim each, some neither... while not agreeing with them entirely, I
think their case is more complex than the facile equivalence between
their anti-state rant, and Raygun's), I, for one, am a left-wing
anarcho-marxist:  and the Clipper eavesdropping chip bugs the hell out
of me.  I've been a bit of a lurker, since I just joined this group,
and haven't quite learned up the technical details of crypto yet (like
the math, etc.).  But I've certainly already told my philosophy
students about this anti-privacy measure signed by uncle-Bill (a
*right-wing* hack, from where I'm sitting).

Yours, Lulu...

There is a known plaintext attack against these generators; see W. Meier and
O. Staffelbach, "An Analysis of Pseudo-Random Sequence Generators by Cellular
Automata," Advances in Cryptography--EUROCRYPT '91 Proceedings, Springer-
Verlag, 1991, pp. 186-199.  The attack is quite efficient on a PC with values
of n (widths of th CA) up to 500.  Additionally, Paul Bardell proved that the
output of a CA is identical to the output of a linear-feedback shift register,
and is hence no more secure.  See: P.H. Bardell, "Analysis of Cellular 
Automata Used as Pseudorandom Pattern Generators," Proceedings of 1990
International Test Conference, pp. 762-768.

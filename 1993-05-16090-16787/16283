You could protect yourself against that by using your "true" encryption and
then encrypting the result with clipper.  To decrypt, you would apply the
algorithms in reverse order.

The encrypted message would have the clipper signature, but would not be
readable to "escrow agents" who couldn't break your backup encryption
scheme.

And if they accuse you of using some other (illegal?!) encryption method,
ask them for the court order they used to get your clipper key out of
escrow.

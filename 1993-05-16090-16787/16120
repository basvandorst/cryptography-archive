You place your bets, and I'll place mine.  Personally, I think the patent
is weak enough that PKP won't prosecute, especially since I've seen some
intellectual property lawyers say publicly they would defend someone
prosecuted for possession and/or distribution of PGP, at no charge.  (That
offer could be withdrawn at any time of course, but....this means even the
little guy has legal recourse.)

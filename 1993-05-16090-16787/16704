Just to toss out 2 cents worth, the DES was published in Scientific
American 4 years ago.  I wrote a software version and found 2 errors
and sent them in with a correct and operational version of the code.
This was published 2 or 3 months later.  Sorry I don't remember
the exact dates, but I *do* know that DES is public and published in
paper form and sits in libraries.  According to the ITAR (or what-
ever it's called now) previously posted, the DES should be exportable
out of the US without hassle.  Has anyone actually been arrested or
otherwise "visited" in regard to DES distribuition???

Patience, persistence, truth,

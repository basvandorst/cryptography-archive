Public comments fax number is 202-456-2461. This seems more reliable
than the CompuServe number. I just today got written confirmation (in
the form of a card) that my comments had been received.

I asked a simple question in my letter: would Clinton's team have
felt completely comfortable using Clipper-encrypted communications
to coordinate activities during last fall's campaign? And if not, why
not?

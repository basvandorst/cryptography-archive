Ok.. the cleverness of the unstrusted server time-stamp
scheme is the linkage to the qualitatively different
kind of 'server' -- the New York Times, say -- in a convenient
way.

Using this principle with the need for arbitrary fine
granularity I suppose in principal one could emit a signal
from earth to reflect off of distant objects
(light years away perhaps) and then measure when
and in what order with respect to other signals they return.

The ether would act as a circulating quantum buffer for
signatures.

Other hard to subvert media might be to splice lengths of
'useless' codons into the chromosomes of some common
sea creature and then release them at different sites in
the world; or maybe dump a mole of buckeyballs with
custom molecules embedded in the center that could be decoded...

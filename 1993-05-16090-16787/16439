Slight correction.  The phone displays a number that is *said to be* the
key.  No guarantees -- it's classified, right?

My own feeling is that the "backdoor" is some form of "man in the
middle", which would let the NSA keep on with its mission of monitoring
international phone calls.  I would guess that the key exchange
protocol can be a three-way negotiation if there is a "listener" chip in
the middle.

Or maybe the Clipper just sends a pseudorandom "display key" that has
nothing to do with the algorithm.  When hardware becomes available, we
can test this with two back-to-back Clippers ....

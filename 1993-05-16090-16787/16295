The "crypt.3" man page found in the "net2" and "386BSD"
releases has a fairly thorough explanation of what happens
(except that it neglects to mention that the encryption constant
is all-zeros).  Look for usr/src/lib/libc/gen/crypt.3

But crypt(3) uses DES, which is not explained.
You can find an explanation of DES in most modern crypto textbooks.

From past experience, I understand the NSA has a secure encapsulating material
they can use to cover chips.  The material cannot be removed without destroying
the chip.  I have no idea if such a material is used in Clipper, but it's
possible.  That would prevent analysis using any conventional techniques.

(We were looking for a secure, unremovable chip encapsulant a few years ago,
and the only one we found was the one by the NSA -- and needless to say, they
weren't interested in letting us use it.)

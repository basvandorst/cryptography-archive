I used to work for a silicon vendor, and have regularly peered thru
microscopes (optical) at silicon dies. You can easily trace out the
wiring, and even tell what sort of transistor you are looking at
(construction details differ (one of them wiill be in a "well" that
has to be tied to a power rail, etc), for equal performance, the the pmos and
nmos have to be different sizes, and most importantly, the silicon
will show as a different color (vaguely green vs vaguely brown)....)
Modern Cmos logic only uses two transistors, one to the rail and one
of the other sort connected to ground. for logic, it doesn't matter
which is which (tho you can tell) -- you just need to see the wiring
to decode the logic.  with a little practice, you can recognize the
gates used without having to do much decoding.

if you can get the top of the die exposed and still operate the chip,
not only are there sem's that will let you do materials analysys, but
there are some that will let you "probe" the operating chip with the
electron beam and see the signals flowing around (you have to get the
passivation layer off for this to work) The machine is expensive, but
rentable.

getting the package open:  there may very well be a coating that makes
it difficult to examine the wiring, removal may be expensive, but
current ion milling machines make it possible to  remove almost
anything in layers a few atoms thick.  Certainly, we don't use
mechanical means to remove epoxy packaging -- either strong acids when
we are in a hurry, di-methyl formmamide when we have to be gentle.

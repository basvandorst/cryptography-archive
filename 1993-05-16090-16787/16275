	PRIVACY-PROTECTING OFF-LINE ELECTRONIC CASH SYSTEMS
        ___________________________________________________


I recently published a new privacy-protecting off-line electronic
cash system as a technical report at CWI. Being a PhD-student at David
Chaum's cryptography-group, our group has a long history in research
in the field of privacy-protecting cash systems.

The electronic version of the report is called CS-R9323.ps.Z, contains
77 pages, and can be retrieved from

ftp.cwi.nl   (192.16.184.180)

from the directory pub/CWIreports/AA.
The postscript-file is suitable for 300dpi laserprinters.

TITLE   :  An Efficient Off-line Electronic Cash System Based On The 
           Representation Problem

ABSTRACT: (from coverpage): We present a new off-line electronic cash
system based on a problem, called the representation problem, of which
little use has been made in literature thus far. Our system is the
first to be based entirely on discrete logarithms; the security is
unrelated to RSA. Using the representation problem as a basic concept,
some techniques are introduced that enable the construction of
protocols for withdrawal and payment that do not use the cut and
choose methodology of earlier systems. As a consequence, our cash
system is much more efficient in both computation and communication
complexity than any privacy-protecting off-line cash system proposed
before.
  
An important aspect of our system concerns its provability.  Contrary
to previously proposed systems, its correctness can be mathematically
proven to a very great extent. Specifically, if we make one plausible
assumption concerning a single hash-function, the ability to break the
system seems to imply that one can break the Diffie-Hellman problem.
Honest users of the system are guaranteed to be
information-theoretically untraceable, i.e., they remain completely
anonymous in the sense that not even a cooperation of the bank(s) with
all shops can find out which user paid in what shop.

Our system offers a number of extensions that are hard to achieve in
previously known systems. All these extensions can be achieved very
efficiently. Perhaps the most interesting of these is that the entire
off-line cash system (including all the extensions) can be
incorporated in a setting based on so-called wallets with observers (a
user-module with embedded within it a tamperresistant module), which
has the important advantage that double-spending can be prevented (!),
rather than detecting the identity of a double-spender after the fact.
In particular, it can be incorporated even under the most stringent
requirements conceivable about the privacy of the user, which seems to
be impossible to do with previously proposed systems.  Another benefit
of our system is that framing attempts by a bank have negligible
probability of success (independent of computing power) by a simple
mechanism from within the system, which is something that previous
solutions lack entirely. Furthermore, the basic cash system can be
extended to checks, multi-show cash and divisibility, while retaining
its computational efficiency.
====================================================================

Cryptographers are challenged to try to break this system!  

I made a particular effort to keep the report as self-contained as
possible.  Nevertheless, if you have any questions, please e-mail to
me and I will try to reply as good as I can. Any comments are also
welcome!

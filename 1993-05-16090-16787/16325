You raise an interesting question, and one that I've been doing some
research on.  My tentative conclusion is that that sort of monitoring
would not stand up to court scrutiny.

In terms of calling lists, there are two issues.  Attaching a pen
register or a trap and trace device to a line to monitor calls is
specifically prohibited by 18 USC 3121, unless a warrant is issued.
However, that is a legislative right, not a constitutional one; the
Supreme Court had held that warrantless pen registers were legal, since
the information provided by them was voluntarily turned over to a third
party, to wit the phone company.

The entire doctrine regarding wiretaps and the like has to do with
``expectation of privacy''.  If an activity or a conversation takes
place under circumstances that suggest that the parties involved desire
privacy, and have some reasonable expectation that it can be achieved
because of actions they have taken, then a warrant is required to
listen in.  Thus, the mere act of using an encryptor would, I think, be
taken as indicative of both points.  You are trying to achieve privacy,
and -- given the noises about escrow agencies and the like -- you have
reason to believe that your privacy will be respected unless a warrant
is issued.

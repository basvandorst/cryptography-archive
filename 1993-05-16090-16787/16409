   In Crypto '85, there's a short article by Stepher Wolfram, discussing
the use of a one-dimensional cellular automaton.  Is anyone familiar with
this sheme?  Has it since been shown to be easy to predict some of the time?
It seemed simple and fast enough that it should be being widely used by now
if it was as strong as Wolfram seemed to think.
 
   The scheme uses a register of N bits (cells), and updates each cell each
iteration by applying the formula
 
   a(i) = a(i-1) XOR (a(i) OR a(i+1))
 
   Has anyone done any tests on this?  If I have time in the next week or two,
I may do some simple testing, but I don't have the time or computer access to
do anything too extensive.

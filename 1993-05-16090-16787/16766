Paranoia lives!

The best corollary to Clipper is DES 15 years ago.  Seem that with 2^^40
*choosen* plaintext (a real practical requirement) you can shave some
small % off the brute force attack.  DES has withstood all practical
attacks and cat calls short of an exaustive attack (and you bet your
paycheck on it every month. ) 

..at last check, no one is forcing you to use it, and you can always
communicate in the clear.

know what they are doing.   Luckily not too many really know..."

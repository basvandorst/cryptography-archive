So owning a copy is not enough?  How would you prove that someone was
using it?  Clearly, a message with "BEGIN PGP BLOCK" would prove
nothing (though I echo the call for these to disappear; I suggest
"begin 600 message.pgp" and uuencoding, with an option to leave off the
".pgp" extension.)  Do you have to successfully decrypt?  Even then, is
any  way of encrypting a message so that your private key will decrypt
it an infringement?

      Suggestions: From a friend at Dibold:
            1)    Get out your modem+laptop, grab the line to the
            bank, tell the machine it has $1.00 & $2.00 bills, not
            $10.00 & $20.00 bills.  Don't be the first to make a
            withdrawal after the change, don't take it all.

            2)    Get out your 2 modems + laptop, monitor the line
            between teller and bank.  Validate transactions, without
            sending them to the bank for your friends.  You will have
            trouble with transaction sequence numbers when you leave,
            but by the time they start out after you, you will be
            gone. 

            3)    Business using direct debit are the best of
            targets.  Security around phone lines of this type is
            not what it is around banks and teller terminals.

            4)    This list is not complete.

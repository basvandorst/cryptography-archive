I was criticized for not pointing out that encryption can be implemented
at layer 3 or 4, and I agree with those critics; however philosophically,
CLNS makes use of whatever communications resources are available to it.
Unless all possible links/networks are encrypted (which can be
prohibitively expensive), there is the possibility that individual packets
may be transmitted in the clear. To ensure data security, the users have
to provide end-to-end encryption, which is the concept underlying the
clipper chip. 

My point is that CLNS is conceptually incompatible with the FBI digital
network proposal.

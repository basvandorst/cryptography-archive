Being a second semester junior in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering
(double major), I am now rappidly considering a PhD in the areas of
computer security, network security, or cryptography.  I was wondering if
there might be any suggestions as to schools to consider that have programs
(or active research) in these areas (these areas are not the flashy "computer
graphics" or "robotics" areas, so they rarely make it into a school's PR 
literature).  Any help, comments, or suggestions would be greatly appreciated
(either posts or email - email will be sumarized in a post later).  Thanks in
advance.

I'm afraid y'all are missing the point - the NSA *wants* the clipper to be
secure, algorithmically speaking.  So long as they have easy access to the
keys to our private communications, why would they want anyone to be able
to break it?  And I assume that they have designed in features such that
we can't use non-NSA keying materials, by for example, including some
crypto hash checksum within each key, which is checked by the Clipper chip.
Further, who this thing is completely classified, right?  So who is to
say that the keying material isn't just some crypto-assembly language that
implements the cipher function?  If we *were* able to force release of the
Clipper chip's innards, we might find that it's just a general purpose
micorprocessor with some extensions to make substitution and permutation
functions easier, thus a public review of the chip would yield no valuable
opinions on the security of the system, as all security is within the
keying material itself!

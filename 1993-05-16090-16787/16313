"Computers in Physics" journal (vol.6, no.6, p.590, Nov/Dec 1992) reports 
on US Gov. developments in ultra high speed computers. Among different 
designs one is of interest for this newsgroup. I quote:

"In another interconnection circuit project, the US Department of 
Defence is funding the development of a 128 x 128 superconducting 
crossbar, which will provide an "intelligent" switching matrix for highbandwidth
(greater than 2 Gbits/s) connection of 128 processors to 128 memories. 
The switching matrix will include an arbitration network, which would 
resolve contentions that can arise when more than one processor requests 
the same memory. The crossbar system (see Fig. 10) consists of a vacuum 
chamber, to insulate the superconducting electronics from room 
temperature, arrays of processors and memory-port electronics at room 
temperature, and a superconductive multichip module cooled to 
liquid-helium temperature 4 K. The 128 x 128 crossbar is realized by a 4 
x 4 array of "switch chips" containing the matrix connection circuits, 
and four "glue chips" containing interface circuits. The niobium 
circuits are being designed at Hypres and UC Berkeley; the 
superconducting multichip module at MCC; and the external interface 
electronics at Tektronix."

Fig. 10 carries the caption: "Superconducting crossbar switches 2 
Gbits/s data streams between 128 processors and 128 memories. (Courtesy

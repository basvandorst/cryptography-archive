   2) The algorithm contains a secret backdoor which might be discovered
   if the algorithm is analysed.
Unlikely - SkipJack is being incorporated in the Defense Messaging System,
and probably other military applications, so a secret backdoor would
probably not be acceptable.
   4) The knowledge of the algorithm will allow third parties to produce
   "non-escrowed" encryption devices.
That's certainly possible - and they could produce them in software
versions as well as hardware, making control more difficult.
Of course, we can do this now, using triple-DES or idea, but maybe
Clipper would offer some technical advantages.
   5) The knowledge of the algorithm will allow an attacker to submit a
   fake Law Enforcement Field, thus spoofing the communication.
Not unless you have the Family Key, which will hopefully be protected.
   8) The reason is classified.

Some additional possible reasons:
   8a) We're the government, and we don't feel like telling you.
   9) Security by Obscurity isn't adequate by itself, but if you've got
      well-designed security anyway, Obscurity doesn't hurt,
      and it makes it more difficult to use traditionally effective
      cryptanalysis techniques such as bribery....

However, it WOULD be interesting to ask the official people for an
official statement....

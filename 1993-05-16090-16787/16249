Could somebody in the USA please ask some official source who is
supposed to be competent on the matter, why is the encryption
algorithm in the Cripple chip kept secret? I can imagine the following
possiblilities:

1) The algorithm is not secure enough and an attacker will be able to
break it, if s/he is able to examine it.

2) The algorithm contains a secret backdoor which might be discovered
if the algorithm is analysed.

3) The algorithm is violating a patent and the patent holder might
file a patent infringement case.

4) The knowledge of the algorithm will allow third parties to produce
"non-escrowed" encryption devices.

5) The knowledge of the algorithm will allow an attacker to submit a
fake Law Enforcement Field, thus spoofing the communication.

6) The algorithm is already being used elsewhere and the NSA (or
somebody else) has reasons to hide this fact from somebody.

7) A combination of the above reasons - please specify which of them.

8) The reason is classified.

It will be very interesting to see the answer. Even if the answer is
not the -real- reason, it will still provide some information.

Regards,
Vesselin

No, Uncle Sam is not that dumb, and yes, you are missing something:
the motive.

As with many government actions, this one does not have anything to
do with what it appears to.   The motive is to resist the casual use
of cryptography.  It is not intended to deny access to crypto to 
criminals but to discourage its use by the law abiding.

While the NSA may have succeeded in duping the FBI into believing that it
has something to do with catching bad guys, its real purpose is to protect
the efficienc0y of signals intelligence.  When analysing government action
in crypto, remember that the primary goal is to protect the 60K+ jobs in
NSA.  If you remember that, you will not go far wrong; if you forget it,
you will wander endlessly in Wonderland.

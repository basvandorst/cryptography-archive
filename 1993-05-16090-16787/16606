    I like this idea and it has several other uses.  For example,
encrypt your videos (or still photos) and send them via satellite--the
home studio has the key.  Or keep the private key in RAM and use your
computer normally.  Turn it off when the police show up, and/or have a
more sophisticated challenge/response system which destroys the key if
you don't log on every twelve hours, etc.  Since the journalist never
sees the private key, it can't be rubber hosed out.

     After reading this news group for a few weeks now and asking
some questions, I have come to some conclusions about the Clipper
proposal, it's implications, and what I think I should do about it.
     First, I am going to quit spending as much time as I do
reading this news group.  The time will be better spent informing
friends and associates about the proposal, it's upside, and
downside.  I have yet to encounter anybody in my day to day routine
that has even heard of Clipper, much less understands it's
implications.  Getting out in the world and talking to the general
population seems to me to be a better use of my time then to listen
to the knowledgeable argue among themselves over what appear to me
to be minor issues.
     The major issues as I see them are the possablity that the
encryption system has a 'back-door.'  This is not a threat to the
general public.  Given the agency who designed it, I suspect that
they are the only ones who can read it.  Also consider the fact
that the use most people will put it to is to protect their
cellular and portable phone conversations from idle eavesdropping
by neighbors and their kids.  I don't think they will worry to much
about the NSA/CIA/FBI being able to listen in.  Most people assume
that these agencies can do that now and don't worry about it. 
     Corporations, attorneys, and tradesmen concern themselves with
security of a higher level, i.e.  their competitors getting trade
secrets, the local police 'reading their mail', etc.  The biggest
problem here is with attorneys and the attorney client
relationship.  No competent attorney discusses sensitive
information on the phone nowadays anyway.
     The next problem is that a 'government approved' encryption
system may lead to a government mandated ban on private encryption
systems.  This is the biggest threat as it directly impacts on our
freedom of speech.  This is not a technological problem at all and
whether or not there are technical problems with Clipper or the key
escrow scheme bear no relationship to this.  This issue should be
attacked directly, not with indirect attacks via the Clipper chip
and it's technology.
     In the letters I am writing to President Clenton, my congress
people and my friends I am stressing the point that while a
generally accepted and standardized encryption system and protocol
is a basically good idea, it could lead to a legal restriction on
the use of other privisy systems.  This is a very bad idea.  I
think the general public could be made to see this, even if they
can't understand the technical issues relating to Clipper.  I also
think that once they understand this, the chances of it happening
will diminish to almost zero.  That's what we are after, right?  I
will also be telling people that they should continue to treat a
Clipper equipped telephone as a telephone - it will convey your
words to an intended recipient, but it may also convey those words
to an unintended recipient.
     <Please do not take anything I said personally, this is
     not an attack against any specific person or the group in
     general - I just think it's time to spread the word to
     the general population, rather then just to the group of
     professionals and hobbyists we have here.  You made me
     think, and that is invaluable.>

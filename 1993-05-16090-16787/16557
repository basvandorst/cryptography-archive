   Am I correct in guessing that weak IDEA keys are keys that have long strings
of 0's in them?  (Ie, 25 0's?)  I could see that that kind of key would do a
poor job of changing bits by XORing *or* Adding mod 2**16, and would wind up
often multiplying mod 2**16+1 by powers of two.  Or is this something more
involved?  Can you tell us anything about the structure of the weak keys?

Not necessarily.  The smarter developer will use a one-way function, so you
can't work out the key even if you know what the SN is.

Of course, this still doesn't stop you patching the binary, but...

The install program for 4DOS (an excellent replacement for DOS's
COMMAND.COM) requires a key which depends upon your organization name.  So I
couldn't use Mantis's key to illegally "unlock" a copy without having
"Mantis Consultants" burned into it.

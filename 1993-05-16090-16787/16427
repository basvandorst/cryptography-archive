From the viewpoint of VISA, its banks, and even its customers, whether or
not it is difficult for people with bright ideas in crypto to get
venture capital is not a concern.  It is certainly not a justification
for using smartcard technology when it cannot be cost-justified.  To do
so would be asking VISA to subsidize the crypto market.  And in the
computer field, we already have too many solutions in search of problems.
(IMHO, the voice-activated VCR controller is a good example of this,
though it *would* be a useful device for physically handicapped folk.)

If VISA's data is indeed biased in such a way that there are large
fraud costs to customers that are not reported in the analysis, that
is a worthy thing to attack.  But remember that a solution that costs
more than the cost of not fixing the problem is frequently not a good
solution.

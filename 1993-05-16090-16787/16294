Getting back to the main question, it is possible to determine the
composition spectrum for a chip by surface science methods, such as
secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS), and Ion Scattering
Spectroscopy (ISS) to name a few.

SIMS will let you do 3D composition profiling, if you raster the ion
beam across the chip.  The technique basically sputters layer after
layer of atoms off the surface, and runs them through a mass
spectrometer.  Single quantum wells (Angstroms thick) can be detected.
I'm not sure of the side-side resolution-- I'd have to look that up.

ISS basically takes a low energy ion beam (<5keV) and bounces it off
of the surface.  The intesity of the reflected ions (at a given angle
and reflected energy) will depend on the species present on the
surface.  This technique can also be rastered, and combined with
sputtering, to give a 3D profile of composition.  It takes a bit more
data analysis than SIMS, but it can be done.  ISS has resolution on th
eorder of tens of micrometers, if I remember correctly, and can go up
to millimeter resolution.

Just to add $0.02 of extra support for Ed Hamrick's point about DES
being in the public-domain (although he's sufficiently demonstrated it
already), I've seen several posters here mention that DES code was in
fact published in _Byte_ magazine a couple years ago (although
apparently with some kind of error).  Clearly  _Byte_ is in numberous
public libraries of the old-fashion kind with walls and racks and all
that.  I didn't see the article myself, so this isn't 100%
confirmation, but I've seen it mentioned enough times that it would be
peculiar if it were untrue.

Yours, Lulu...

According to an article in the May 10-16 Defense News, it appears that
Clipper may have been the government's attempt to head off use of a
different, privately developed encryption system:

From the article entitled "Scrambler Contract Award Spurs Protest":

Washington- In a move expected to greatly expand the market for voice

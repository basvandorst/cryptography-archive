      One fundamental problem is that the chip not only has to be able to
resist current reverse-engineering techniques, but those developed in the 
next 10-20 years, depending on how long the standard lives.  The way
technology for looking inside objects is progressing, this is a big
gamble.  The last 20 years have seen the development of CAT scanners,
MRI scanners, scanning tunnelling microscopes, atomic force microscopes,
scanning electron microscopes that can image electric charge, positron
emission tomography, and a whole collection of new machining techniques.
What will the next 20 years bring?

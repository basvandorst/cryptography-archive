RSA is one such algorithm. Most numbers are easy to factor, but
some are quite hard. If they had kept the keybuilding process of
finding two large primes, both equal to 3 modulo 4 etc... secret
then most keys would be easy to break.

I vaguely remember the opposite. I thought that it was hard to 
cook the sboxes in such a way that it wasn't obvious how to
break the system. Of course, there is a middle ground in between
our two memories. Any one with harder facts?

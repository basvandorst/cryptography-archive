	Wow! Quantum cryptosystems! When observed, they become stronger,
probably the photons striking the algorithm has a tempering effect?

	The correct statement is that a secure system's strength is
independent of the secrecy of the details of the algorithm. If you have
a secure system, and you have some other reason for keeping the details
to yourself, this doesn't make the system more breakable.

	Please don't give me some jive about how the NSA can't know
it's secure unless they post it here so every ignorant goober can
peer at it. This is like saying 'we can't be *sure* Ali was *really*
a great boxer, after all, he never fought Pee Wee Herman!'

	All this is, of course, almost completely independent of
the actual security of Clipper.

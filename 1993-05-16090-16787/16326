Such an exemption is indeed not in the statute, but is recognized by
the courts.  I recently picked up the following ref on exactly this
question, but cannot remember from whom.

%T patents and the progress of science: exclusive rights and experimental use
%A rebecca s. eisenberg
%J university of chicago law review
%V 56
%N 3
%D summer 1989
%P 1017-1086

Actually, I haven't read it, but the summary given seemed conclusive.

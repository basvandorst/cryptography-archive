The proposal doesn't handle conference calls. This is just another indication
of the complete ignorance of the network demonstrated in this proposal.

Another question, how does the telco handle conferencing compressed 
voice on leased line trunks. Answer, the telco service provider doesn't.
It is up to the owner of the private network to be able to confenrence
proprietary compression algorithms.

The service provider cannot handle conferencing, the service provider
cannot handle isolation. The Clipper proposal is just another indication
of the ignorance demonstrated in the FBI Digital Network proposal.
The FBI has difficulty bugging calls on even today's network
as demonstrated by the conference example given above. The FBI will
find it impossible to bug the multimedia broadband network.

The FBI's solution - legislate the broadband network out of existence
with regulations that make it uneconmic. Keep the North Amaerican
telecommunications market firmly in the 1970's while Japan and Europe
produce a 21st century network.

The US can make its choice but Clinton wants to encourage telecomunications
as a strategic technology while at the same time he allows some
gum shoe luddites to prevent new development.

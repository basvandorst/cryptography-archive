What if clipper is fairly secure but leaves a distinct clipper signature...
that is, what if it's not too difficult to tell that a msg. was clipper
encrypted, even if you can't tell the contents?  In that case, anyone 
who is trying to hide behind anther encryption scheme will stand out
from all of the other traffic and raise a red flag to the NSA, etc.
 
Just a stray thought....

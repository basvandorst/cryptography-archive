Yep, whether or not it is true is another matter... :-)

This is an interesting point that Dave raises.  What happens if the
NSA is caught lying?  Well, first you'd have to prove they were lying,
which would mean locating a memo which indicates this (good luck) or
an employee who exposes this info.

I thought the NSA was legendary in its legal tricks: it will stonewall
and remain silent under a cloak of national secrecy, miss court
deadlines (invoking further pleas of security), and then at the last
moment de-classify certain documents and thus void many lawsuits
against it.

Heck, they are suing John Gilmore over books available in the public
library.

Ok, this is fair.  It just seems like you are saying "well, the gov't
is telling us there is no back door, so there obviously isn't" when
even one of the most basic tenets in cryptography is that a truly
secure system is secure when the algorithm is public.

I'm just saying that even though they are saying there is no back
door, a review should be done anyway.   Who knows, the results may
surprise...

Well, I've carefully guarded my copy against just such an occurrence.
Basically, Wright asserts that a large amount of duplication was used
by the Russians from "the early years of the war" to 1948. Wright says
that since the Russians had five separate channels (Ambassadorial, GRU,
Naval GRU, KGB, and trade) with vast amounts of traffic, they must have
felt the risk was worth it. A break came with the acquisition of a
partial codebook and the use of collateral information to attack the
trade channel. Very little traffic was broken (Wright estimates 1%)
and, as Owen Lewis says above, most was broken years after the fact,
but Wright asserts that it gave the West insight into the sheer
magnitude of the Russian intelligence effort, and identified areas
of penetration by Russian agents. Obviously, very valuable.

Those interested can refer to chapter 13 of Spycatcher (1987, Peter
Wright with Paul Greengrass). The counterintelligence effort was
named _venona_.

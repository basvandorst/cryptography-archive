I have compiled very large lists (>600,000) of English words, phrases, names,
places, and other categories that may interest you.  Since the National Security
Agency is a customer for at least one of my products (Moby Part-of-Speech)
there is no reason not to let everyone else have access to these works.

To censor distribution of ideas based upon policing other's intentions is
morally wrong to me.  That is one reason why I support widely available
encryption tools in the first place.

Please send e-mail with a postal address for more information.

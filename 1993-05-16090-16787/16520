I was thinking about using a high speed and high density digital tape for 
a OTP keying source for a cryptophone.  I'd use an Exabyte 5.0 gig 8mm tape,
a 14.4K modem, and, say LPC-10 for the digitization.  You'd get, lesseee,
5,000,000 kilobytes per tape, 2,500,000 kilobytes each direction.  That's
lots of time of keying!

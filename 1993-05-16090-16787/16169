  According to one of the essays in "Kahn On Codes" the NSA these days is only
cracking about one message in twenty-five from any halfway-modernized nation;
many of the cases where they -do- succeed are the result of operator error
rather than poor encryption technology.
  This was about ten years ago.
  So much for the possibility that locking the barn door on strong crypto
at this point will do a bit of good.

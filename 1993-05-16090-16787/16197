More interesting was that some of the people where NOT stoolies, but in
a very vulnerable position if they didn't deliver the right results. At
least one of these people implored Feynman to take the job, and do what
others in the system dared not. Not also, RF had generaly high opinions
of the NASA engineers, it is the managment that stinks.

Um, I'm confused; where is the fiction? this has been a major govt goal since
1948. It is well documented in the open literature. See the works of Alex
Cary (sp?) for a start. A lot of what he has written is not yet published, and
may never be.

The cripple proposal is quite standard type of fare for the us gov. It is not
the 'the reds are comming' line, that went with the wall, it is now 'the enemy
within'. This is for the govt an improvment. With an external 'enemy' you have
little or no pretence to turn the guns on 'the masses', with the 'evil drug
barrons', who *MAY* be the next door neibour, they can openly turn the guns on
you! And it enriches AT&T, Mycotoxic et al, the main reason de entre for all
of it. Can you say 'industrial-military-complex'?

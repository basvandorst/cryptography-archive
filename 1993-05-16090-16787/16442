That would depend on how the binary data is represented. There's no
reason that voice encrypted with RSA couldn't "sound like" ordinary
voice. Example: every 'n' bits is encoded as one of (2^(n-k)) words
spoken in one of 2^k tones. The bandwidth might be low, depending on the
size of the dictionary available and the capability of the voice production
and recognition software on either end. It would also obviate the need for
a direct modem hookup: you simply take your phone off the hook and put
it next to your computer's speaker.

As others have pointed out, it's highly unlikely that a good cryptographic
system would produce output that gives that much information about its
input, so this discussion is probably moot for clipper.

	I agree with you 100% Phil but unfortunately the only value that
	seems to carry much weight these days in America is the bottom
	line.  Look around at how the social fabric is being torn in
	the interests of saving money and being efficient.  Its sad
	that the value of personal liberty is way down the hierarchy
	of needs in modern america but I'll take any argument that
	is correct and works to save my freedom.

MacPGP 2.2 Bug Note

MacPGP 2.2 contains a bug affecting only certain Macintosh models running
System 7.  The bug manifests itself when typing a pass phrase into the
password dialog window: there is a very noticeable delay in response to
keystrokes and usually there is a system crash after a few characters are
typed.  This problem seems to occur only on Mac Pluses, SE's and (original)
Classics running System 7.  Other machines don't seem to be affected and the
problem doesn't appear at all under System 6.

MacPGP 2.2a is bug fix release to take care of this problem.  It contains NO
additional features.  If you have not experienced this problem running
MacPGP 2.2, there is NO reason to upgrade to version 2.2a.  If you have been
affected by this problem, you may find it more convenient to download just
the bug fix patch rather than the entire MacPGP2.2a archive.

The patch is contained in the file 'MacPGP.bugfix.sit.hqx'.  After
unarchiving this file use ResEdit to replace the 'CODE 0', 'CODE 2', 'CREL
2' and 'DATA 0' resources in the official release version of MacPGP 2.2 with
the ones contained in the bug fix file.  There is also a revised 'vers'
resource, to bump the version number up to 2.2a (0.9.6).

The files are as follows:

   MacPGP2.2a.sit.hqx		Full PGP 2.2a release for the Mac
   MacPGP.bugfix.sit.hqx	Just the patches
   MacPGP.bugfix.README    This information

They have been uploaded to src.doc.ic.ac.uk and ghost.dsi.unimi.it.  They
will hopefully make their way from /pub/tmp to a more permanent home.  I am
also posting the bug fix file to alt.security.pgp.

For more information (including details of source patches), see article
<PmaR4B5w165w@mantis.co.uk> in newsgroup alt.security.pgp.

  Public key cryptography is based on a special type of mathematical operation
called a "trapdoor one-way function".
  In a "trapdoor funtionn" it is relatively easy to caluculate the function
of a given number x, but very difficult to calculate the inverse function
of a given number y.  Thus, the function is like a trapdoor that is easy to
fall through, but difficult to climb back up through.
  What is special about cryptographic trapdoor one-way functions is that they
have secret information used to derive them that makes it relatively easy to
compute the inverse function -- and this secret information is not easy to
determine if all you know is the function.

  The best-known example of such a function is the RSA algorithm.  Without
getting into the details, the public key (used to compute the function) is
based on the product of two large numbers and the private key (the secret
information that makes it practical to compute the inverse function) is
based on the two individual numbers.  If the numbers are big enough, the
encryption/decryption is still reasonably fast on a computer, but it would
take practically forever for someone who knows only the public key to get
the secret information -- that would require finding the factors of a
seveal-hundered-digit number.

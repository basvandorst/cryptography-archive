[GUNT87] is probably C.G. Gunther, "Alternating Step Generators Controlled
by de Bruijn Sequences," Advances in Cryptology--EUROCRYPT '87 Proceedings,
Springer-Verlag, 1988, pp. 5-14.

[SIE84] is probably T. Siegenthaler, "Correlation-Imunity of Nonlinera
Combining Functions for Cryptographic Applications," IEEE Transactions on
Information Theory, v. IT-30, n. 5, Sep 1984, pp. 776-780.  This is a very
importatnt paper.

I have no idea about the third.

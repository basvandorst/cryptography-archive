I deliberately used the term "rubber-hose-resistant" rather
than "rubber-hose-proof," by analogy with watches that are
water-resistant but not waterproof.  As I said in the
Conclusion, no complete solution to the "rubber hose" problem
exists.

Mistreating foreign journalists has costs, both for individual
government employees and for the government that employs them.
They must weigh the costs against the expected benefits.  If
they expect large benefits, they'll do it anyway.  But if they
think they've probably already gotten all the keys, they may
refrain from further action.

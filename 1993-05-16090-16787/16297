I agree. When I was in the Navy, I repaired cryptographic COMSEC units. The
Printed circuit cards in the units were covered with epoxy ceramic coatings
that were opaque and imbedded with tiny rocks or pebbles. Any attempt to 
reverse engineer these cards would destroy them.

We also kept a sledgehammer handy in our crypto cage. If our ship was going
down, we had orders to destroy all crypto equipment with our hammer.

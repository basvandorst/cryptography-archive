  Hmmm... given the error corrections in modern audio CDs, is it sufficient to
simply instruct your agent to decrypt using the bit stream from the second
cut of the latest Garth Brooks CD, or are the usual number of bit errors
found acceptable in commercial CDs because of that error correction enough
to garble the message if such a method is used?

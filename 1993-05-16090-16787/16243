A TEM can not only scan the pattern (3D) but also the composition of the
material. Many universities has TEM for their research on semicondutor
layered heterosturcture with resolution up to a few A. There are also
many spectroscopy techniques that can analysis the doping composition
etc. I just do not have any idea what kind of technique is employed
in cliper chip so that it can be resistant to TEM. If cliper were
widely used in business, there would be incentive for an adversary
company or country to invest a couple of million dollars to throughly
study it.

Any enlightment?

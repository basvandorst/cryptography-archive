    The IBM ATMs I've used have horrible software, and they give
    you little useful feedback when you've inserted a bad number.

    They're pretty darned secure.  The ones I've seen in banks have
    a safe built around the mechanism on the back, and the front is
    armored against smash & grab attacks.  Some imbeciles in Los
    Angeles were filmed trying to crack one open during the riots.
    In college the Wells Fargo ATM was vandalized periodically, but
    the worse that was ever done was damaging the paint.

    About the only thing one might be able to do is rent a huge
    truck w/ crane and steal the whole ATM, much as the bad guys
    dragged safes into the desert in the old cowboy movies :-).

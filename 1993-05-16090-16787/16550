The "observer" is a chip that sits inside your cryptographically secure
store of personal information and digital cash -- it ensures, essentially,
that you don't lie to people by doing things like spending the same
digital banknote twice, claiming credenttials you don't possess (or
the lack of "negative credentials" you do possess) etc. There's a protocol
for communication between the observer, "digital wallet" and the rest of
the world that makes cheating by any party very difficult. (It involves
signatures by certifying authorities and a bunch of other good stuff.)

As I understand it, compromising an observer might get you the ability
to compromise transactions in which it was involved (or possibly to
forge individual transactions in general). Reverse-engineering a clipper
chip could give you the ability to compromise calls made with that particular
chip, to fabricate an unlimited number of unregistered Cliiper chips,
and, if there's a backdoor, to listen to all clipper-encrypted
conversations (since the serial number is transmitted with each call).

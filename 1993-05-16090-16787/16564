I'm not entirely dumb in mathematics (I've done rather competently in
a *little* graduate work), but having just read the 'sci.crypt' FAQ on
RSA, I'm left a bit foggy on some details.  I actually more-or-less
understand how the encryption and decryption work; but my problem is
with the generation of (p,q,d,e).  I don't actually know how one goes
about generating a 256 digit (binary) prime -- so if anyone can tell
me really quick, I'd be extremely interested.  However, leaving that
to the side, what really perplexes me is how one goes about finding
'd' and 'e'.  I know one has to locate large numbers satisfying:

	de-1 = n [(p-1)(q-1)+1]		; for an integer n

But it's not clear to me why it's automatically easy to find such d
and e.  I'm sure I'll kick myself after someone explains it, and I see
just how simple it is -- but could someone please do this.

Yours, Lulu...

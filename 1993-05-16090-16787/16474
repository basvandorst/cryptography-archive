Hello.  I am working on a project and I would like to know if there 
is a list describing the various encryption/authentication schemes used
by commercial software on the market.  It should have the following info:

      *  Name of Program and Company  (of course :-)
      *  Version (both release number and US or International)
      *  A description of the particular implementation (Details)
            Is it DES with six-letter passwords (insecure)?
            Is it proprietary?  If so, how does it work (monoalphabetic
              substitution, repeated password XORed with plaintext, etc).
      *  Description of any weaknesses.  If available, citations for 
           published references.
      *  US Export Status:  Yes, No, n/s (Not submitted), n/a (Not 
           available.

If no such list exists, I am willing to take E-mail replies and I'll post 
the results in a week or so (Use the email address in .sig). Let me know.

                        -Ernst Smith

P.S.   I know about WP51, but would appreciate any other info.  Expecially 
       on Lotus Notes and PKZIP.

P.S.S  PGP isn't commercial software.

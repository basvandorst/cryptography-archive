   The Scientific American article covers much more than digital
   cash.  For example, a potential employer asks
      "Do you have any of the following:
	 a) B.A. and 3 years' experience?
	 b) 10 years' experience?
	 c) Ph.D. and recommendations?"
   and the observer answers "yes."  I don't understand how this
   sort of thing could work without a tamper-proof observer.

To provide any of these, you need one or more "credentials agents" who provide
a relatively trustable credentials service; otherwise none of it works.
I'm assuming you believe that single credentials can provide an adequate
level of trust without observers; otherwise this all breaks.
You also need some sort of credentials wallet that you can verify is yours
and not somebody else's.  Several potential approaches:

- you can transmit the request to the credentials agent along with
	the information for identifying you and blind-signature,
	and get back a "yes, this user meets at least one criterion" token.
(The following options assume you've got an MS and 6 years experience:)
- if you're willing to give away *which* category you're in,
	you can give the employer your "B.A. or better" token and
	either "experience" tokens for 1990, 1991, 1992, or a 
	"3 or more years between 1985 and 1993", or whatever.
- you can give them a "BA or better and 2 or more years between 1980-1989" 
	token and a "1 year between 1990 and 1993" token.

	Depending on how informative you want to be, you may have a 
	variety of tokens with different degree levels, years of experience,
	and date ranges for the experience, which gives you some flexibility
	in combining experience credentials from different vendors
	while making it possible to show all your years of experience
	without being able to double-count them.

	You can make the tradeoffs about how much each credentials vendor
	knows about the credentials you have from other vendors,
	e.g. one vendor knows about college and the co-op job,
	another knows about your job programming mailing lists for NORML,
	another knows about your job working for the CIA,
	another knows the total years of experience but not the employers,
	because you gave them the tokens from the other vendors that
	had the dates and salary levels but not the employer name...

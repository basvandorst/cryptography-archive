As a lifelong member of the post first and proof read later school, I, 
of course, left out a rather key work in my recent post about the Friday and
Sunday NYT articles. 

The missing word is 'opportunity'. Kindly insert it where it will fit best
(if at all). My choice is, following the line that ends "as much".

Sorry about that.


Cheers,

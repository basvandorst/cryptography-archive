I'm no cryptographer, just a simple number theory person.  But the following
occurs to me.  Suppse you have a plaintext message which you break up into
blocks of length n.  Now encode this message using an error-correcting code 
which will correct n errors.  Then garble the message somehow, perhaps by 
jangling your keys against the transmission wires a la Stoll.  Now you have 
an encoded message which you can decode by correcting errors.

How could you beat such a scheme without knowledge of the error-correcting
code?

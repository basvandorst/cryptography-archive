I must respectfully disagree with your interpretation of the regulations.
If you'd like a copy of the actual text of the Defense Trade Regulations
(ITAR doesn't exist any more), I'd be happy to e-mail them to you.

Here is the definition from the Defense Trade Regulations:

DTR> Sec. 120.19 *Public* domain.
DTR> 
DTR>     *Public*  domain  means  information  which  is  published and which is
DTR> generally accessible or available to the *public*:
DTR> 
DTR>     (1) Through sales at newsstands and bookstores;
DTR> 
DTR>     (2)  Through  subscriptions  which are available without restriction to
DTR> any individual who desires to obtain or purchase the published information;
DTR> 
DTR>     (3)  Through  second  class  mailing  privileges  granted  by  the U.S.
DTR> Government;
DTR>     (4)  At  libraries  open to the *public* or from which the *public* can
DTR> obtain documents;
DTR> 
DTR>     (5) Through patents available at any patent office;
DTR> 
DTR>     (6)  Through  unlimited distribution at a conference, meeting, seminar,
DTR> trade  show  or  exhibition,  generally  accessible to the *public*, in the
DTR> United States;
DTR> 
DTR>     (7) Through *public* release (i.e., unlimited distribution) in any form
DTR> (e.g.,  not  necessarily in published form) after approval by the cognizant
DTR> U.S. government department or agency (see also Sec. 125.4(b)(13)).

It seems pretty clear that DES code that is available via anonymous ftp
meets this criteria.  You may choose to quibble about whether making
something available via anonymous ftp constitutes publishing, but consider
what percentage of jurors would laugh at anybody asserting that information
available via anonymous ftp  doesn't meet the intent of 120.19.  I myself
would tend to focus on subparagraph (5) referring to libraries open to the
public or from which the public can obtain documents.

Asserting that the ITAR doesn't define the word "published" is as meaningless
as asserting that the ITAR doesn't define the word "exhibition",
or "trade show", or "libraries", etc.  This kind of quibbling is completely
meaningless - are you saying that you need to print out the DES source code
and put it in a University library before it can be distributed via
anonymous ftp?  If so, this is a triviality.  Anybody can open up a "library"
to the public (item (4) above).  Most people would claim that anonymous ftp
constitutes an electronic public library.

U. S. government rules are always written.  Please refer to specific rules
published in the Federal Record, or specific legal cases.  Are you saying
that the "Defense Trade Regulations" have not superceded the ITAR, as clearly
noted in the Federal Record?

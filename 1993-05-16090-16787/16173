   Chances are that this will also mean that if someone steals a bunch of
   unprogrammed chips, they'd be useless without d. which will probably be kept
   highly and separately secure. It may also mean that the chip manufacturer
   can't play games.

The specialized control software is the most interesting part.
The family key means that a phone with a non-family chip won't be able
to talk to a Family-approved* phone, since you won't be able to match
the 23-bit authentication pattern for your 25-bit serial number
(I was very interested to see that the serial number was now shortened,
which means that they can only make 32 million Clipperphones!)

But what does the special control software do?  If it's only doing
the policy enforcement, that says that versions of the chip may be
available that DON'T insist on talking to other Family-approved phones.
On the other hand, if it does something like feed the key schedule to
SkipJack, this may be a way of keeping the algorithm more secure.

   The more I hear the more it sounds as if the NSA has broken  its back to
   provide us with secure crypto (if you don't mind the key escrow part).

We already had secure crypto (if you don't mind the no key escrow part.)
They're just telling us ve should buy it, und ve should like it,
and they can break *our* backs if ve don't cooperate.

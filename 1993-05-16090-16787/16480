I'd like to add a plug for a book that I've found very helpful:
	Carl Pomerance, ed.  _Cryptology and Computational Number Theory_.
	1990.  (from lecture notes for an AMS short course in 1989)
On page 130, in section 7 of the chapter by J. C. Lagarias, there's
a discussion of several PRNG's whose output can't be predicted without
solving outstanding number theory problems: inverting RSA, factoring, 
or taking discrete logs.

I really like this book, and I've found it very helpful.  (I'm
a theoretical chemist, not a hard-core number theorist; my only
professional connection to all this is that my Ph. D. thesis is
all on Monte Carlo calculations, so I'm interested in randomness
and RNG's.)

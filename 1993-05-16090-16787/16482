Suppose I had a 650 MB optical disk of genuinely random numbers

Suppose the crypto system uses an array of integers and another
array of operators as the key, and generates a OTP stream from
this disk by selecting each n(1)th byte, op(1)ing it by each n(2)th byte, ...
and wrapping around the disk space as required.

Disk access speed may be a problem.

The key space is real large, and brute-force solutions have a factorial
complexity.

Does this make sense?  Is it better than known crypto-quality PRNGs?

BTW, there don't seem to be crypto-quality PRNGs published here.

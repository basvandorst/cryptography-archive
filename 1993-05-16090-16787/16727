I know that there was an instatnce where the US government "visited" Texas
Instruments when they were about to publish their digital signal processor
applications book. They were asked (told?) to pull the code to implement DES
on TMS 32025 processors. The description of DES remained. Yes, DES is also
available from the govt as a one  of the government computing standards.

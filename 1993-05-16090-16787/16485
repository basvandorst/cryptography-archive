This generally sounds like a good idea whenever entering a password
(e.g. logging into your favorite machines) -- some amount of trojan
horse defense, anyway.

Usually less than that.  Not all 10000 permutations are allowed as valid
PIN codes for some companies.  I recall being told by one plastic card
issuer (phone company?) that the first digit of the PIN was restricted
to certain digits only.  This, of course, excluded the new PIN I was
trying to request.  Grrrr.

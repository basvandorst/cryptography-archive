 According to the ITAR (or what-

I truly hope you either have an excellent attorney and $$$, diplomatic
immunity, or check with the Department of State, Office of Munitions
Control.  Unless things have changed since 4PM PST today,  a license is
required for DES export from the U.S.  In general, US businesses receive
little resistance to using DES for their own inter-company use overseas.
(An export license is still required) Export for financial applications
(such as tying an overseas branch into an existing EFT network) is
normally permitted.

Has anyone actually been arrested or
>otherwise "visited" in regard to DES distribuition???

I believe the answer is yes.
I heard from the "Powers that Be" that individuals have been prosecuted
for unlawful export of DES (the specific citation was a Floridian who
sent his Video Cipher II unit to his brother in the Bahamas.  The
incident was apparently tracked back by the legitimate registration of
services via a service provider such as HBO.  This was about  Fall of 
1988.  He apparently made his fatal mistake by verbally abusing those who
brought it to his attention, telling them what he thought of ITAR 13b
(Comsec section). His room and board were later provided for by your tax
dollars, although I don't know for how long.)

Citibank made a similar mistake in 1987,  but they took the matter
seriously, and then took appropriate action to make sure it didn't happen
again.  The "cognizant party" at Citibank told me it was delt with very
professionally by USG personnel.  She walked away (without handcuffs) and
nothing happened after that.

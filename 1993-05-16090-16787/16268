I've been reading the section on Linear Feedback Registers in J.
Seberry's book "Cryptography: An introduction to computer security".
(section 7.1 pg 268). However, the references quoted are not given
in the bibliography!!!

Does anyone have any idea of what they are??

   [GUNT87] [SIEG84] [VOGE84]

They're to do with adding non-linear and time-dependant features to
data s.t. the linear feedback register is usable for encryption, w.r.t.
some reasonable level of security that is.

Any help much appreciated!

"Digital cash" -- am I missing something here? "Cash", in my book [or
pocket, at any rate], is a form of money which is essentially anonymous.
It leaves no transaction record; creates no audit log [OK, let's ignore
the serialisation of baknotes with unique numbers]; "is good for all
debts, public and private". VISA cards and so called "cash cards" do 
not have this functionality -- they produce very detailed information
about their holders, such as where they were, what they spent, what they
bought, over what period they paid off their owings to the credit 
provider.

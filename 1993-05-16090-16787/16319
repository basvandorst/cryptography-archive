I'm a new reader to sci.crypt (actually only dropped in to ask a few
questions, but I read through the stuff on this cute "clipper" chip
thing). I had to make a few comments on this testimony.

Isn't it true that the Federal Government has required the various
service providers to implement methods for transferring control to
the Government in cases of national security (as defined by the
Government)? Wouldn't these methods pose security problems in their
own right (aside from the obvious possibility of Government abuse)?

First, am I wrong or is the above item the same avowed
goal of the recent FBI Digital Telephony Proposal? I suppose it will
be up to the providers to implement the standards developed. Second,
in light of the above concern about unauthorized eavesdropping, how
can one make a switch "really secure, but not *that* secure"?

I think this is the crux of the argument underlying the discussion
in this group. The "clipper" chip technology indeed does not
provide law enforcement with new authorities to access the content
of the private conversations of Americans. But it also does not
provide Americans with new protections from the abuses of law enforcement,
except to the extent that a simple wiretap would no longer suffice
(one must also compromise the escrow agencies, obtain an illegal
warrant, or compromise the encryption of the session key). The
"clipper" chip announcement, furthermore, provides the Federal
Government with additional leverage to prohibit strong (private)
encryption.

I must also add that, when I started reading this group a few
days ago I had heard nothing of these developments elsewhere,
and still have heard nothing except through this group.

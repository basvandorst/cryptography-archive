You'd have a hard time - BUT in reality someone always aquires the
error-correcting code and then you are beat six ways to Sunday.

Thats why to be considered a stong scheme it must be possibe for you to
release the method, the plaintext, the cypertext and STILL have no one
be able to deduce the key.

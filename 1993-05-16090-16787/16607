	In addition to Racal Guardata, of whom you already know, the following cryptosystem manufacturers sell DES implementations to approved users in the UK.

Racal-Datacom. This is a UK-based successor to the Racal-Milgo merger. It 
markets the Datacryptor 64 for link encryption. This is (I think) a US design and used DES in CFB mode. It also can utilise double length keys and has a 
particularly well thought out key management system.

Data Innovation offer DES encryption in the following products:
		a. ED2048. A 2Mbps link encryptor. OFB mode. Optional to 
ANSI X3.92
		b. PCP400 internal cards. 
			(1) For PC and compatibles. Mod 1. DES only
			(2) For PS/2 MCA. DES + RSA (key length to 512 bits).

			N.B. I think these are IBM units that they are reselling. Throughput to 14.4 Kbps.


GEC-Plessey Crypto offer the Datalok L. A link encryptor to 19.2 Kbps.


Info Guard AG offer:

		a. i-2010. Data to 2.048 Mbps. Propietary algorithm as standard. DES on request.
		b. i-3010. For X.25. To 64 Kbps. Proprietary Algorithm as 
standard. Des on request.

Winkelmann Security Systems are selling imported TRW fax encryptors that implement DES.


Gretag AG will (with sorrowful gaze) supply a range of their fax and data  encryptors with DES if so stipulated by a customer. 

This list is not comprehensive; it's just what I had to hand. 
 

Carl Ellison of stratus.com mailed for this information information but my 
mailer ate his address before I could use it. My apologies to those whose 
bandwidth has been wasted.

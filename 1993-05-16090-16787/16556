Try "A public-key cryptosystem based on algebraic coding theory" in that
omni-popular journal _Deep Space Network Progress Report_ #42-44, Jet
Propulsion Labs, 1978, pp. 114-6.

Or, try "Security-related comments regarding McEliece's public-key
cryptosystem" by Adams and Meijer, in an unknown journal from Queen's
University in Kingston (whether that's Kingston, NY or Kingston, Jamaica,
or wherever, I don't know).

These citations are from "Cryptography" by Seberry and Pieprzyk (Prentice
Hall 1989).

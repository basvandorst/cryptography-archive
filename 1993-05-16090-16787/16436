Ok, there's something I'm not following here.

I've read the technical bulliten with the overview of operation and I'm 
having difficulty seeing where a receiving Clipper chip gets enough 
information to decrypt.  

The very first step in building the 'Law Enforcment Packet' thingy is to 
encrypt the 80 bit session key under the chips serial number - one of the two
*unique* numbers on the chip.  Other information is appended, and another
encryption done based on a non-unique number, but how does receiver clipper 
ever undo this first crypt to get the session key?  Is there some logic
to the choice of serial numbers, or does one of the other pieces of transmitted
information yield something.

Also, what the hell is an 'IV' (intermediate value???).  The doc says that 
the chips use the session key and a random 'IV' to 'establish cryptographic
synchronisation'.


Thanks,

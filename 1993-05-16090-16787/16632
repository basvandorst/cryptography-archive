Try anon FTP from csrc.ncsl.nist.gov (129.6.54.11).  There is a file, 
DSS.TXT, from the the January NIST CSL Bulletin which gives a (non-technical)
background on the DSS proposal and describes ways of getting FIPS by snail
mail.

For detailed info, FTP the file SECHASH.TXT, which is a 1/22/92 draft of the
technical specifications for the Secure Hash Standard.

I obtained these document by using the BBS dialup (301/948-5140), but the
FTP site should work as well.

I do recall this. If you bother to read all the possible answers to my
question, you'll see that one of them says:

8) The reason is classified.

I am ready to accept an answer like "We can't tell you why SkipJack is
kept secret, because the reason for this is also secret". This will
actually provide some information. However, I want to hear the answer
from an official source, not from you.

You didn't clarify anything. Number 4 still reads:

4) The knowledge of the algorithm will allow third parties to produce
"non-escrowed" encryption devices.

However, you remind me to include another possible answer, between 6
and 7:

6a) The algorithm is kept secret because the US government does not
want other parties to use such a strong encryption algorithm.

I do read everything that it posted here, including, alas, your
messages. However, if you read what I have written above, I am
interested in an answer that comes from an authority - and an answer
to the question I posted, not a pointer to already published stuff. I
am definitively NOT interested in your speculations or interpretations
of what has been posted here.

So, could somebody please ask the question above to some authority?

Regards,
Vesselin

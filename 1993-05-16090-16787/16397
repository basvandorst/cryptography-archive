It was some time in 1977 from memory (I've got copies here somewhere
buried in the mess).  Interestingly enough, no library on the country has
the two issues of Byte the code appeared in.  Every other issue of Byte
going back almost to the beginning is available in many NZ libraries, but
the two issues with DES code are missing in all the ones I could check.
Eventually I got a photocopy from someone who brought a large collection
over from the US.

Has anyone else from outside the US had the same problem?  I'm wondering if
this is just a coincidence fnord, or if there was some organised plan to
stop those issues leaving the country....

Peter.

The "observer" chips proposed by Chaum are not meant to provide the
whole security. The idea is to use cryptographically secure protocols
for the transactions, and use the observers for those things that
cannot be solved using cryptography alone. For example: in an
electronic cash system without an observer it is not possible to
prevent a user from spending the same coin twice. What the
cryptographic protocols can do is detect which user spent a coin
twice, and provide proof of this fact. The role of the observer is to
provide prior restraint i.e.  prevent the user from even attempting
this fraud. Even if the tamper-resitance of the observer is broken,
then the user would still be caught after the fact by the
cryptographic protocols. This combination provides the best of both
worlds. The security is fully cryptographic and prior restraint is
provided by a tamper-resistant device.

Here at the CWI we are currently working on the incorporation of
observer into electronic cash protocols. One of our other aims is to
structure the protocols in such a way that the users privacy is
unconditionally protected even if the observer is returned to the
central issuer after use. This requires that the observer doesn't
'see' which transactions the user is involved in.

Hello,

RSA as DES are under the restrictions of US Export Regulations, but 
there are implementations of DES and RSA that have been developed outside
US and are not bound by US restriction.

Is anyone out there who knows of a RSA's implementation available from 
a company in Europe and how a company in Europe can apply for a RSA's license.

Thanks,

....sal.

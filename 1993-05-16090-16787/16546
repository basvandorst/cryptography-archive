I've recently learned that one of the factors keeping smart cards out
of the US is cheap telecommunications. In Europe, communications is so
much more expensive that the ability of smart cards to do offline
verification is a real economic advantage. Here it's claimed to be
much cheaper to just make a phone call for every transaction to verify
the number and amount.

But I really would like to see a comprehensive tally of the costs of
credit card fraud in the US. Not just the direct economic losses to
the banks, credit card companies, consumers and merchants, but also
the indirect costs of criminal investigation, prosecution and
incarceration.  The credit card companies base their decisions only on
their direct costs, but we all end up paying both the direct and
indirect costs in higher prices and taxes.

And then there are the less tangible but no less important costs.
Credit card fraud is largely responsible for law enforcement's
increasing interest in bulletin board systems, which has engendered
considerable confusion about a sysop's liability for his users'
activities.  If it were impossible to commit credit card fraud by
simply knowing credit card numbers, this would eliminate one major
reason the First Amendment is having such a chilly time in Cyberspace.

Yes, you are obviously missing something. The PTT cards I mentioned
are digital cash cards, they are not credit cards. If you have money
in your account the ATM will let you have your bills, if you have
a zero balance, no cash. So instead of carrying a bulging valet you
carry your digital cash card. Of course the card leaves transaction
records, but so do you when you visit the bank in the first place.
The bills you get from the ATM though are supposed to be as good as 
those you carry in your pocket.

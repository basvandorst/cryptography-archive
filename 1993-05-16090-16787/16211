Something I haven't seen meta-discussed here just hit me in the face (I
may have missed it in the intense noise ;).

Most of the strident complaints about how evil the Clipper chip
cryptography key escrow system is come from the right side of the aisle.
Most cries of alarm, on usenet at least, seem to be generated by
conservative and libertarian voices, or voices that at least lean in those
directions (like me).

On the other hand, most of the government abuses of law enforcement info
and activity have been directed towards those on the left side of the
aisle.  The above-mentioned UK anti-nuke groups, the anti-Vietnam War
activists, central american people's activists (CISPES, etc.), and
other left wing organizations have been the traditional victims.

I submit that Clinton is not being true to his own roots in allowing the
spooks in the US government to create yet another opression tool.

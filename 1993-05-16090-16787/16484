   You can't just use a widely-available CD as a one-time pad, since the
   Bad Guys can decode your stuff with an easy brute-force search if they
   know what your CD is, but you can use it to make brute-force DES decryption
   non-useful.

As I pointed out here a few years ago, this isn't true.  A one time
pad consisting of the LSB's  of samples of the latest rock hit isn't
very good, because the keyspace is small.  But if we choose, say, a
dozen CD's, and some time offsets for each CD, and XOR the bits
together, then we have a large keyspace (<# of CDs>**12 just for the
selection), and a pretty good OTP.

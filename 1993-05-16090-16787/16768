Subject: Norton NDisk encrypted disk problem/question
Lines: 19

A user has Version 5.0 of Norton Utilities and was running an
encrypted virtual disk - or "NDisk" as Norton calls it. When
an attempt was made to change the password, the data appears
to have been trashed. The old/new passwords are/were valid,
and the attempt was made by the properly authorized user. The
encryption technique is Norton's "proprietary" one.

There seems to be no way to "undo" an encryption. I am
suspicious that there may be a bug in Ver. 5.0 that causes
data on the NDisk to be multiply-encrypted, rather than decrypted
with the old key and re-encrypted with the new key on a password change.
Norton tech support has been useless and rather uncooperative
on this entire matter.

Can the data be recovered??

The user reports that no backup exists.

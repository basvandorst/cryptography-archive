I'm getting out of my depth here, but what I meant was something like
the following:

If I'm trying to prove that I have a credential C, which has been
signed by some authority A (whose public key is known), the person
I'm trying to convince can ask me a series of questions about the
bits in that encoded credential. If I don't actually possess it
(or A's private key, with which I could synthesize one at will),
I have only (very roughly) one chance in 2^N of answering N
queries in a consistent fashion.

If you imagined that someone would just believe a yes/no
answer from the observer, then you're right, but as I 
understand it (not very well) the observer is generally
just a convenient intermediary in conversations between
your digital wallet and the rest of the world.

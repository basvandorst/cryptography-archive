(One of) the RSA/PKP patents covers use of polynomials modulo primes for
the purpose of encryption (it might be restricted to public-key encryption;
I don't remember).  (I think it covers digital signatures also, but I
could be mistaken.)  (Most of) PGP has a non-infringing use; a
reproducable pseudo-random number generator.  (It may not be good at
that, but it is a use).  Hence distributing it is probably not illegal as
contributory infringement.

Also, I disagree with the part of this paragraph where you seem to
be agreeing with me.  Charging is irrelevant.  What may infringe is use (in
this case, transmitting encrypted messages) or manufacture (executing PGP
to create encrypted messages.)

I hate to say this, as I am not a lawyer, but you're wrong.  Patent law
itself allows use of patented devices for certain types of research.  (I
don't remember the details.)  A use/manufacture can only be infringing if
it does not fall under those exceptions.  Whether or not you actually
develope a new process, if you only use it in development, I think it's
covered.

For instance, (one of) the RSA/PKP patents covers use of polynomials modulo
primes for the purpose of encryption (it might be restricted to public-key
encryption; I don't remember).  (I think it covers digital signatures also,
but I could be mistaken.)  If you don't use the encrypted data, but
develop algorithms which include that and/or an additional (unpatented)
encryption method, you could patent THAT algorithm, although use of
RSA-type encryption would require licensing that from PKP.

Please -- let's temper our paranoia with a dose of realism.  This doesn't
come close to working.

First of all, the chip's key U is composed of two halves XORed together.
To start your attack, you need U1 and U2, not U.  (But see below.)  Second,
U1 and U2 are generated from triple-encryption using Clipper.  To recover
keys from that sort of operation would require a back door the size of
an airplane hangar's, or maybe larger.  If they could do that, they wouldn't
need an escrow key, or even U; they could recover every session key
directly.

Actually, the XOR of U1 and U2 could be regarded as yet another encryption
of U1, to produce U.  But U2 is itself the result of two triple-encryptions.
I very much doubt you can reverse any of that.

Ah..., a 64 bit block implies that the session key E(K,U) fits on block
boundaries.  That should be 2 blocks with the 80 bit key added to an
authenication pattern.  As in E(Kp1,U) & E(Kp2 & authen,U).

E 	Cryptographic Algorithm
Ec	Encryption Algorithm cipher block chained
K 	session key, Kpn part of session key
authen 	authentication values, used to verify successful decryption
U	Unit Key
F	Family Key
[]	specifies 64 bit block boundary
&	concatenation

The size of the serial number is wrong from what we have been otherwise told.
The size of the filler authentication pattern must be as well.

should be Ec( [E(Kp1,U)] & [E(Kp2 & authen1,U)] & [N & authen2],F ) ?

(consistent with D. Dennings posts)

Unless is Ec( [Ec(Kp1,U)] & [Ec(Kp2,U) truncated & N & authen],F ) ?

(consistent with above)

Prof. Denning had said that the size of the serial number was subject to
change.  The NIST file gave a date (in the file) of 20 Apr 93.  The
The revised Denning document gave a date of 21 Apr 93.

If these things are in silicon, will we be able to get any accurate
descriptions (without revealing the Cryptographic Algorithm)?

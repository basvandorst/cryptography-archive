	Exactly.

	This is what I referred to in my earlier discourse on the topic.
I did a toy one-time pad against /dev/rz0a (a hard disk with a file
system). The disk had large free spaces which amounted to blocks of
zeroes in the one-time pad, so *zap* there was my plaintext just
sitting right there!!

	I suspect that if you are looking at some data that's been
run though a one-time pad and suddenly you see a paragraph of legible
english, then you *KNOW* that the guy who generated it has a real
lack of randomness in the system. ;)

mjr.

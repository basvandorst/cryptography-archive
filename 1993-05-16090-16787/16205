Why not?  The media does it, pressure groups like HCI do it, and I bet
that the government does, as well, when they want to 'adjust' the
tone of an expert's report.

Besides, I think the above condensation pretty well describes the main
purpose of Clipper, and why the government is so all-fired hot to
ram it up our backsides, SIDEWAYS.

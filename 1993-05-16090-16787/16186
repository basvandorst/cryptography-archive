Not true. People keep diaries, and have a reasonable expectation that
noone, except for themselves, will or should ever read them. It
therefore makes perfect sense to be able to securely encrypt one's
diary so that it won't `accidentally' be read by anyone else. 

A diary is the human equivalent of backing store; you can't keep all
the details in your brain, so you write them down on paper, or disk,
or whatever. As such, however, a diary should be treated as an
extension of one's memory, and should be entitled to the same privacy
guarantees (e.g., 5th amendment in the US) as `real' memory. Does this
make sense from a jurisprudence point of view? (I think so). Any
precedents that establish this one way or another?

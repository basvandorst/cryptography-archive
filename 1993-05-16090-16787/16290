I think I have the general gist of this whole public/private key
thing down.  Okay, something encrypted with your private key
can only be decrypted with your public key, and thus it is a
type of "digital signature".  Something encrypted with your public
key can only be decrypted with your private key, ensuring privacy.

Now, how does the actual encryption/key-assignment program work?  I
know this is probably really naive, but I can't find the FAQ
anywhere.  Is my public key derived from my private key or vice
versa?

1.  If so, what prevents someone who knows my public key from using
it to derive my private key?

2.  What mechanism is preventing someone who knows my public key
from decrypting plain-text encoded with that key by using the
reverse of the encryption algorithm?  Or is this math way beyond
my mortal talents?

Thank you much,

BH

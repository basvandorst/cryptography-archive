This isn't really true unless you have to defend against a known
plaintext attack.  You can prevent such attacks by changing DES keys
for every message, and using something like RSA for key exchange.  I
know of no practical ciphertext only attack on DES.

Does anyone know of such an attack? 

Andrew.


NB  Measuring the entropy of the plaintext doesn't help- it might be
CELP compressed speech, for instance.

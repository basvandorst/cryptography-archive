Having a non-infringing use is irrelevant.  If something infringes any of
the claims, then it infringes.  Regardless of what use you make of it.
That's why claims are made to be as broad as possible.

Charging for distribution MEANS selling it.  That is explicitly and
quite clearly selling an infringing device which is covered by the 
US Patent laws.  Charging is not irrelevant.   It is also clear,
though very weird, that the act of importing into the US a message
encrypted by PGP (or any non-licensed method that is the subject of
a US patent) is also an infringement.  You say that use and
manufacture in the sense of the messages -- actually, the law
says the use, manufacture or sale of the device (in this case, the
program) is an infringement.  That's what we are questioning as being
an infringement.

I have the law in front of me and there is *NO* exception for infringement
for "certain types of research".  You may chose to think me wrong, but
please tell me why.

Again, if what you create does the same thing as specified by any
of the claims of a patent, then you have infringed that patent.

I suggest that what you think is the law is only what you wish it
to be.  It may or may not be better than the reality of the law, but
you should really check your "facts" before claiming them to be facts.

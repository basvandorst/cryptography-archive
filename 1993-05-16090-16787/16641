N93-151 TITLE: Quantum Overt Technique Exchange Systems (QUOTE)

CATEGORY: Research, Photonics

OBJECTIVE: Provide a means, based on quantum cryptography, of
exchanging information for the purpose of discreet decision making.

DESCRIPTION: Quantum cryptography exploits the unavoidable disturbance
of photons of light when an eavesdropper intrudes on a polarized
connumications channel employing light generators with quantum
correlation.  In cases where multi-level security is desired, where
joint decisions are made based on separately private information, or
where authentication is the issue, quantum cryptograhy may have
important applications.  Although devices have been built, they have
mathematical inefficiecies.  Schemes using an information-processing
procedure called oblivious transfer have recently been described which
could well be the most promising applicaiton of quantum devices.

PHASE I: Study the mathematical approach and feasibility of
constructing a quantum device for use in short distance (local) liks,
such as a ship automatic switching system or a shore-based,
multi-national control complex.

PHASE II: Demonstrate a proof of concept model at a land based
operational setting.

PHASE III: A successful Phase II will have worldwide significance for
DoD and a profound effect on commercial applications for privacy
protection of individuals and businesses.

I have a Pascal implementation of probabilistic relaxation that I can send
you.  Ref:  King, J., D. Bahler.  "An implementation of probabilistic          
relaxation in the cryptanalysis of simple substitution ciphers."  Cryptologia
16(3):215-225.  July 1992.

I've ported the code to C and extended it to solve periodic polyalphabetic
substitution.  Wrote another program to take the output of relaxation (many-
to-one mappings) and resolve it to one-to-one mappings, thus providing
100% accurate plaintext decryptions.  The extension of the code was trivial.
The fun part was implementing the IC calculation over subsequences of the
ciphertext and the one-to-one mapping resolution.

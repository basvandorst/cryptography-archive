I have no idea whether the storty is true or not but, if true, it must 
have got several people put up against a wall and shot. 

OTP are not manufactured, packed and shipped like chocolate bars where a 
duplicated order is normal. OTP would be stringently 
controlled items, with each pad individually accounted for at all times. 
The Soviets were masters of cryptography and the inevitable result of 
a deliberate production of duplicated editions would have been quite clear.
If an edition were split between two services it would be because that 
edition was intended for joint service communication and would have been strictly reserved for that purpose.

No, on the whole, I think there may be two stories here that have elided. 
However, operational control of large OTP editions on other than a single 
directed net must be a nightmare even if the operating instructions were 
designed to allow for it. Soldiers can screw most things up if given half a 
chance and as for secret policemen, well.....  ;-).

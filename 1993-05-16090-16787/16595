Why not use a public key system, leaving the private key at home in the
safe. Use the public key to encrypt your notes. When safely out of the
country, you can decrypt them.

This does not solve the problem of needing to refer to your notes as you
are doing your interviews. You could keep some info encrypted with a key
you know (only what you could tolerate having fall into enemy hands). 

Sort of like keeping some cash in the register, and putting any extra in
a time lock safe you don't know the combination to. If your lucky, they
might buy the "I can't open the safe" story".

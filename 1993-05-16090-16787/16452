Bill Stewart mentioned the re-use of OTPs and the problems associated
with it.  There is one major case where this happened, during the 50s
(I think) in the USA, where soviet agents had so much intel they ran
out of pads and were forced to re-use them!

(sorry, that should read 'one major case that I know of' and I'm
using a naff text editor :-{

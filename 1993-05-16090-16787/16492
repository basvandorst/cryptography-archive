How random are the bits on a music CD?  Does a CD with lots of silence
or very quiet passages have lots of zeros?  Or equivalently low-entropy
bit strings?

How random are the least significant bits of the samples?  Are the
least significant bits out of the A-to-D's unbiased?  Do they tend to
have any common frequencies, maybe from "hunting" by the A-to-D's?

If you took an arbitrary CD, would it be evident if someone had hidden
a one-time-pad in the least significant bits?  Perhaps because the bits
would be "more random"?

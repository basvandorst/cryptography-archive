I am very very new to encryption, but had an idea and wondered if it's unique
or in common usage. Basically my idea is to encrypt a text file by shuffling
up the letters much as a deck of cards would be. However, it cannot be 100%
random or else no decryption would be possible.

A password would be an argument to the encryption and shuffling would vary
based on the password entered.

This seems harder to put together than a large jigsaw puzzle. 

Or what about multi-phase encryption? By this I mean scramble the letters
like I said, but then use another algorithm to mess them up even more like
a sin curve to shift their ascii value or something.

Please send E-Mail with comments.

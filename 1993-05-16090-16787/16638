Why not just encrypt the data using a public key assigned to you by
a "security and notary" service?  Encrypt with your own first, if you
don't want them to ever see the contents.

Then, the info can't be gotten out of you, and the service could
be sure you were under no constraints when they performed the
decryption at their facility, or after verification across the net.

Please be careful to distinguish between DES in *source* code and and
executable DES.  The former is technical documentation, not a crypto
device.  I export technical documentation that falls under the
'public domain' exemption all the time.

People make the same error thinking that they are violating a patent by
providing *source* code (which is, after all, just a extremely unambiguous
decription of the process or algorithm) compared to the working executable.

No matter how hard you try, eating a *description* of a sandwich is not all
that satisfying.

(The above should not be construed as legal advice; you have pretenses to being
a free human being: do what you want.)

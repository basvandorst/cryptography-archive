OK, I'll bite.

Ms. Denning  was challenged  many times  to defend her position on
key registration and Clipper. Some of those challenges were nice,
some were heated. She chose to ignore the reasoning of her
opponents and she didn't  provide any argument,  neither 
here (in public), nor in private e-mail conversation.

Tired or not - it does look like she has nothing to say
(except for maybe some more details of how Clipper chip
works).

Dixi.

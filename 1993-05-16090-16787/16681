Yes that was my fault, I realized after I had sent the article that
I had used Financial instead of Fund.

This is entirely correct, but I have been talking about systems that
have been implemented and already are in use.  My banker friend mentioned
this electronic cash idea, but he said that to his knowledge no system
like this is in operation apart from the prepayment cards used for
telephones and other services.  He mentioned though that they are already
preparing to use SmartCard debit cards in an off-line mode. Whenever
you are using the debit card in an online ATM your credit balance on
the card will be updated with a date stamp. When you are using the
card in an off-line ATM you will be allowed to do purchases up to a 
certain limit of your on-card credit balance.  This is not yet operational
but are plans for the future.  Of course this is still not untraceable
electronic cash, just an extension of EFT, but it shows that perhaps
they are moving in the right direction.

Apparently the banks are not yet pursuing the idea of untraceable
electronic cash.  I guess there are legal problems involved as well
as I can imagine that the authorities don't like to much the idea of
large amount of untraceable cash flowing around. Bank notes carry
serial numbers and can be traced even if it is not easy to know how
many hands the notes have passed.  With new regulations in force
concerning money laundering the banks are rather prudent these days.

Recent work at the BT Laboratories at Martlesham Heath has demonstrated
transmission over a 10km link.  I believe this has been reported in
various Journals.  The April '93 (Vol 11 No2) issue of the BT Technology
Journal carries an article* on the topic of Quantum cryptography which
includes "...secure key transmission over several kilometres of optical
fibre is possible using readily-available components."

*Quantum cryptography and secure optical communications.

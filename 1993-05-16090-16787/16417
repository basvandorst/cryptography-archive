	Am I missing something with the above figures? If it's accurate that
it would cost 7 billion to save 50 million a year, overall, for everyone,
then I am down on smart cards too. In this case the selfishness of the
big boys in in the interest of the little guys. We gotta pay for it
either way, and $7B in one chunk is just plain more than $50M a year forever.

	Karn seems to be indicating that the $50M would be saved by the
credit card companies, while vastly greater savings would be enjoyed by
the other levels of the heirarchy, but this is not clear from the quoted
remarks. Is it true?

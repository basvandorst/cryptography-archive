While it may be true that key escrow requires *some* kind of secret, it's
certainly not necessary (as you seem to agree) that the secret be the algorithm
itself. Digital signatures would work just fine, and in fact be much, much
better in that the secret could be changed, partitioned (different signatures
for different applications of chips [e.g. defense crypto vs civil crypto)
and maintained in a physically unassailable fashion (e.g. only encrypted
signature, not plaintext, is stored in chip). Depending on the algorithm's
secrecy is putting all the eggs in one basket -- if the algorithm is ever
successfuly RE's or otherwise disclosed, all extant chips become worthless.

I believe there is NO TECHNICAL REASON for not disclosing the algorithm,
as technical alternatives to algorithm secrecy would always have better
features for all concerned. I can think of a couple of POLITICAL reasons
for keeping the algorithm secret (i.e. back doors or weak implementation).

Dorothy was right the first time.

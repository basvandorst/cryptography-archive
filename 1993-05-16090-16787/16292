I was just wondering what encryption algorithm PKZIP 2.04g uses.
I would like to use it to protect some important data and need to
know if a few months from now someone will come up with a 
"PKZIP 2" cracker the way they did for PKZIP 1.10 and WordPerfect 5.1

Please respond by e-mail if possible.

Thanks

The problem is called "The Dining Cryptographers Problem," and it was
invented and solved by David Chaum ("The Dining Cryptographers Problem:
Unconditional Sender and Receive Untraceability," Journal of Cryptology,
v 1, n 1, 1988, pp. 65-75).

The algorithm is simple.  Each cryptographer flips a fair secret coin with
the person to his left, and another to his right.  Then each cryptographer
announces the XOR of the two coins he sees.  If he paid the bill, he
announces the opposite of the XOR.  If no one paid, then the XOR of all
the announced values will be 0.  If someone paid, then the XOR will be 1.

It is trivial to prove this result correct, so it will be left to an 
exercise.

And it was me that gave the talk at Fermilab.

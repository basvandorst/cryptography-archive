The US gov't does not have any obligations to answer questions of
citizens either, nor even to read them.  Most white-house mail
probably makes the circular file pretty quick.  And 99% of the
remaining gets one of twenty form letters.  However, I *am* a US
citizen, and if Vesselin would like to compose the text of questions
he would like submitted to the whitehouse, and email them to me, I
would gladly send them in under my name -- and post any responses to
this group.

Yours, Lulu...

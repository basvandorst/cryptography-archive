Andre Berthiaume and Giles Brassard of IRO Universite de Montreal, CP 6128, 
Succursale, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3C 3J7 write:

"In a bold paper... David Deutsch put forth .. the quantum computer.... What 
makes a quantum computer so different from a Turing machine is the 
possibility it offers for massive parallelism within a single piece of 
hardware.

Let f be a computable function ... The quantum computer allows you to 
prepare an input that encodes both x and y in .. quantum superposition... 
your program .... produces the quantum superposition of f(x) and f(y) in the 
time needed to compute the function once only .. The catch .... quantum 
mechanics severely restricts the way in which you can look at the result 
.... 
f(0)+f(1) represents a crucial decision that must be made within 24 hours, 
such as buying or selling on the stock market, but that computing f takes 
almost one day on either input. With a classical computer nothing can ever 
be achieved ... In sharp contrast the quantum computer allows one to obtain 
this exclusive-or with probability 50%... the quantum approach gives a 
useful answer every other day, while the classical computer never does... 

...quantum cryptography provides a technologically feasible oracle-free 
approach for harnessing quantum physics for computational purposes,,, it 
mildly challenges the Church-Turing thesis itself...it allows one to achieve 
tasks that are demonstrably impossible when Turing machines are allowed 
unlimited computing power."

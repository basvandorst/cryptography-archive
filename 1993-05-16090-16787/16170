   As far as I can see, no matter how the session keys are generated (be it
   Diffie-Hellman or whatever), any Cripple conversation which travels in

Active wiretapping is a problem with ANY public-key system.
You have to design your key management protocols carefully,
or you won't be able to avoid it.  One way military systems
avoid it (especially from the days before RSA) is to use a 
Key Distribution Center - every call include a call to the KDC
to exchange some piece of information, like session key encrypted
with your private key or a Diffie-Hellman half-key or something.
I think the AT&T "Cinnamon" patent by Joe Everhart and Jeff Osborn
did something like this with DH and DES, though it's been a long time
and I don't think it's used by the phones.  Needham-Schroeder does
some similar stuff.  The old fashioned briefcase-handcuffed-to-CIA-agent
method does the job as well, though it's best reserved for the
master key that you use to talk to the KDC.

Another way to avoid it, if you're using Diffie-Hellman, is to set up
the secure connection and then read each other the half-keys by voice,
with the phone telling you the number to expect.  (You can't have the
phone do it automagically, because this would be easily spoofable.)

There are lots of variants on it, all worth a good academic paper or
two, and maybe a master's thesis :-)  RSA makes the job MUCH easier,
because you can do digital signatures in a hierarchical fashion,
and keep a copy of the top-level certifier's key on all machines
(or in the phone book or whatever.)  Any good commercially available
system has to have addressed it somehow, and since the AT&T and Motorola
phones are presumably based on their STU-III products, they'll
probably include something.

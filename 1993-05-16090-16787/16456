   There are cryptosystems built around error-corrrecting codes.  If I remember
I'll bring in some references.  I know there are some in the Crypto 'XX where
XX > = 88, but I'll need to look to see what I can find.
   Specifically, I believe there's a public-key system based on error-
correcting codes.

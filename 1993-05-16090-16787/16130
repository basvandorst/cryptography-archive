Maybe.  I'm not an economist.  Atom bombs can definitely induce the death
of millions.  I'm happy to have export of atom bombs outlawed.  I think it
would be silly to suggest outlawing speculation in pork belly futures.

That depends.  Is it the place of a government to make sure that people are
so limited in their behavior that they are incapable of doing harm?  I
believe that the USA is based, in part, on the notion that the people are
free -- and that includes the freedom to hurt others (and be punished for
it, once caught).

Really strong cryptography (ie., as strong as that used by the military *of
the time*) has been in the hands of private citizens since the creation of
cryptography (which Kahn dates back to 4000 years ago).  Granted, what was
strong in biblical times would be a joke today.  What's strong today will
probably be a joke in 3000 years.  Read Kahn's "The Codebreakers" for
details.

Throughout all this history, private citizens have been inventing, owning,
distributing and using their own cryptography.  Sometimes, they distribute
it to governments.  Sometimes governments invent their own.

I have no desire to ask NSA to make their own cryptosystems available for
use by the general public.  I want only to use fully available systems
(currently RSA, DES, IDEA) and ones I and others in the private sector
invent.

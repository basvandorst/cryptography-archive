Although not exactly an epiphany, something has got to be deeply flawed
when reasonably diligent citizens of a state cannot determine whether
something is against the law or not.  Wasn't that the point of the
written "Code of Hammurabi," to prevent arbitrary application of laws?

This is another reason to continue to work for strong public cryptography
and anti-traffic analysis -- we've got to keep alive the possibility of
distributed revolution.

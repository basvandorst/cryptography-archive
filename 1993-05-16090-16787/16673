In this example the information to be protected is the sexual orientation
of Alan and Larry. The policy for sharing the information is "it is OK
for another gay person to know I am gay, but nobody else". This example
was chosen because it is topical. Another version is "its OK for someone
else in the resistance to know I am a freedom fighter, but not the
Gestapo" and so on.

The protocol I illustrated seems to me to work fine as long as the
opponent can not get access to the decode key through skullduggery like
turning authorized persons or infiltrating the organization.

The cryptological problems are:

1) Any hole in the protocol?
2) How to do an audit trail that lets me track down defectors (and
preserves privacy of those whom I beacon, find to have compatible
interests, and still choose not to interact with)?
3) How to do key revocation?

You are right about the big problem with this being security policy.

A simple version of this scheme is in daily use in gay bars around the
world. One wears a hankerchief of a particular color, hanging on one side
of the body or the other. The "hankie code" is often posted in ALT.SEX
and the like (I have a copy if anyone wants it emailed to them). The code
book contains dozens of entries. In places with active vice squads, all
the security problems mentioned in the previous posts have come up.

I am also told that an electronic version of this is available over in
Europe (France I think). Sort of like an Identification Friend or Foe
radar transponder. It is supposed to vibrate when someone compatible
comes by.

It is sad that the only way the Gay and Lesbian Authentication
Directorate can fully protect the security of its members is to conduct
polygraph examinations, background investigations, and do damage control
analysis of leaks!

Indeed smartcards are coming in Europe.  In Norway, where I usually
live, they are what banks are pushing on their customers.  There are
persistent rumours, though, that they are not really secure: The
rumour is that someone equipped with a smartcard reader and some
clever electronics can extract the PIN code from the card.  You are
supposed to have only three attempts, but I don't know if that limit
is implemented in the card or in the reader.  If the latter, it is of
course worthless, as it can be easily circumvented by a clever person.
Similarly, if it is implemented in the card but can be circumvented by
removing power from the card, it is equally worthless.  Does anybody
here know what is the case?

In support of the rumour, I could mention a case reported in the
University of Trondheim campus newspaper a while back on someone who
had their card stolen and where the thieves extracting over NOK 18000
(US$ 2500) worth of cash and merchandise the very same day, actually
overdrawing the account.  There is a lower limit in the card, but once
they had the PIN, the thieves used stores that only had the
old-fashioned magnetic stripe readers to get around that limit.  The
bank refused any liability, claiming that since the thieves had the
PIN the customer must have written it down, which is (of course)
considered negligent.

Infosecurity News
MIS Training Institute Press, Inc.
498 Concord Street
Framingham MA   01701-2357

Nominally $40/year (6 issues), but free to "qualified" subscribers.
This trade journal is oriented toward administrators and covers
viruses, physical security, hackers, and so on more than cryptology.
Furthermore, most of the articles are written by vendors and hence
are biased.  Nevertheless, there are occasionally some rather good 
crypto articles.

The existence of an inverse map plays an essential role in
decryption. There are weaker systems than groups with similar
properties.
1) A left (right) identity and a right (left) inverse.

2) To each a there is a b such that aba=a.

3) Inverse semigroups.

Reference to 1) is in Marshall Hall's book on groups.
I think 2) is called a regular semigroup.
3) is standard terminology - Try the standard reference to semigroups:
   Clifford and Preston.

Deep ideas are simple.
                      Odd groups are even.
                                           Even simples are not.

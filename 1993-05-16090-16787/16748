My knowledge of Bellcore's method comes from a New York Times article,
but it started me thinking how to subvert even this.  Depending on the
granularity of time, and what size quorum is required, it may be possible
in some limited way.

After about six months, many libraries start throwing away their
paper copies of the New York Times.  And replace it with a microfilm
copy from some place like University Microfilms Inc (UMI).  After
about two years, it is fairly difficult to find original copies
of a newspaper.  It may be possible to intercept the copy sent to UMI,
and substitute a different classified ad copy after the date of publication.

While a few libraries, and maybe the newspaper itself keeps the original
printed copy.  I think the number of copies of the newspaper that
need to be subverted is a dramatically smaller number than at first
imagined.  A week or two after publication, if you can break into
the New York Times archives, UMI, and a few other places, I think you
may succeed in replacing every other copy over the course of a few
years through a ripple effect.

I think this lowers the confidence in the time stamp from a day to a week,
or a month.  For a patent filing, a week may make a difference.

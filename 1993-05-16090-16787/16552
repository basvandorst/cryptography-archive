Joan Daemen, Rene Govaerts, and Joos Vandewalle presented a paper entitled
"Block Ciphers and Modular Arithmetic" at the 3rd Symposium on State and
Progress of Reserach in Cryptography, Rome, 15-16 Feb 93.

The paper describes an algorithm called MMB (Modular Multiplication-based
Block cipher).  It has a similar design philosophy as IDEA, but is based
on 32-bit arithmetic operations and has a block size of 128-bits.  The
authors contend that this algorithm has more provable security.

Additionally, the papers discuss a number of "weak" IDEA keys.  These are
not weak keys in the traditional sense (e.g.: the weak DES keys), but keys
if used can be easily identified using a chosen plaintext attack.  The
number of weak keys is statistically small (the chance of not generating one
is 1 - 2^32/2^128).

The authors do not have a source code implementation of the algorithm.  It
would be simple to implement, given a library that does modular multiplication
of 32-bit numbers.  If someone feels like coding it up, I would love to 
include it in my book.

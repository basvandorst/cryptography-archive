A bit of a pedantic point, but this is not strictly correct. Take a set
of operations ("group" elements) A, B, C, D which maps to itself such
that

AC = BC = D

There is then no inverse for C (and the set is not a group), even though
all the set elements are mapped back onto the set.

Definition of a group:

A group is a set of elements {A[i]} and a composition (or "multiplication")
law which maps pairs of group elements such that

-- for all A[i], A[j] in the set, the product A[i]A[j] is also in the set.

-- the composition law is associative: A[i](A[j]A[k]) = (A[i]A[j])A[k]

-- the set contains an identity I such that IA[i] = A[i]I = A[i] for
   all A[i] in the set.

-- for every A[i] in the set, there exists an inverse A(-1)[i] which is
   a member of the set and A(-1)[i]A[i] = A[i]A(-1)[i] = I

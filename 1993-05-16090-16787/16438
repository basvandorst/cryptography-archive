: One of the key parts of today's nad tomorrow's network will be the private
: network. A company will lease a portion of bandwidth from one of many
: (or several of them) service providers and then multiplex its own
: transmissions onto this bandwidth. The service provider is only responsible

Maybe i'm missing something here, but this doesn't seem accurate to me.
I can only think of two possibilities - the "company" leases dedicated
circuits from the public network, or the company pays for a certain amount
of bandwidth but the circuits are not dedicated.  In the first case tapping
would simply require turning on the FBI wiretap capability from a service 
terminal attached to the switch - since the circuit(s) carrying the
information are always dedicated.  In the second case there must be address
information in order to route the call correctly.  The terminating address
must be accurate in order for the call to route.  The originating address
can be validated by the switch and the call rejected if it isn't accurate.
Either address can be used to activate the wiretap.

I assume a warrant would be issued to tap all transmissions from the
"company" in question - the warrant would be against the entity leasing
the circuits, not against any particular individual that might use the
circuits.  Other than possibly attempting to overwhelm the FBI by
leasing many circuits and passing false information over them (and
spending a lot of money) i don't see any technical difficulties with
the FBI wiretap desires, or with the use of Clipper in conjunction with
this wiretapping. It wouldn't add any really new capabilities to the
network, but it wouldn't restrict any technological advances either.

: The3 FBI has trouble tapping private networks. The FBI sees that
: BISDN networks will become even more diffcult (if not impossible)
: to tap. The solution is simple. Make such networks uneconomic by imposing
: impossible regulations.

Why would BISDN networks be more difficult to tap?  It only requires that
the FBI have the bandwidth available.  Is there some other issue?

: Keep the North American network firmly entrenched in the 1970's. The
: Europeans and the Japanese will gladly develop the next generation
: network for us.

This ignores that fact that some other countries already require switching
equipment to have the wiretapping capability that the FBI wants - even
countries that are considered democratic.  And it is quite likely that 
those European and Asian countries that don't have it will have it soon.

	If our government does not clean up its act and stop using
	violent oppression against its own citizens I think a revolution
	will happen whether or not strong public cryptography is legal.
	No revolution is EVER legal but they happen anyway.  Why?
	Because governments overstep the bounds of acceptable behavior and 
	find themselves almost universally hated.  When a significant fraction
	of the population considers its government the enemy even a 
	totalitarian state cannot endure.  We saw that in the former USSR.
	The more draconian the methods used to crush the rebellion the 
	swifter the fall from grace among the population.  That is why
	"strong" governments like that of the Shah of Iran and Somoza
	and yes the Soviet Union fall in breath takingly fast time frames.

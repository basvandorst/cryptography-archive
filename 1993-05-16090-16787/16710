Does anyone remember "Cold Fusion"?
It involved unsual behavior of substances
on the quantum level.  After rounding up a lot
of Eastern Bloc technological spies, the myth faded
from government and popular press.  Forgive me for 
not being overwhelmed by the academic ink being spilled
on the topic of "Quantum Cryptography," but do you think
is might be another CI spoof?  I'd bet you it is.

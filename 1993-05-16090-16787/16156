Maybe not. According to recently published books, the Sovs have been
using one-time pads, etc. and we've had very little "take" for some time. As
a consequence, the NSA (it is alleged) has reprioritized some time ago, to
non-communications technical (electronic) intelligence, and to focussing on
non-Soviet targets.

If these accounts are accurate, then the NSA had reprioritized before the
end of the cold war, and there'd be no reason to "invent" a new mission to
keep people busy.

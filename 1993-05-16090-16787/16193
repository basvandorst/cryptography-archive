However, if Ali hadn't fought *any* other great boxers, who would believe
him if he asserted "I am the greatest"?

In science and mathematics, peer review is a critical step in convincing
the world of the truth of your claims.  Fermat's Last Theorem hasn't been
disproved in hundreds of years, but because he never actually published the
proof (and no one else has proved it, either) mathematicians are still not
convinced of its truth.  On the other hand, when details of the alleged
cold fusion discovery were published a few years ago, other scientists were
able to knock it down.

I just thought of something: if the Clipper design is classified, the
algorithm can't be patented.  Therefore, if someone invents it
independently (or manages to get around the anti-reverse-engineering
features of the chip) they'll be able to distribute their version.  This
may not be entirely true, since the original manufacturer may have patents
on critical, but unclassified, components of the chip, and a clone would
violate those patents; however, it's nice to contemplate it!

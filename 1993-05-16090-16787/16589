It depends on what you mean by "work". The observer itself
doesn't have this information; instead, you must use some 
kind of protocol to convince it. That means the user is relatively
safe. Meanwhile, the zero-knowledge proof tricks make it exponentially
unlikely that a hacked observer will be able to falsely convince
someone that a user holds credentials (signed by other, known parties)
that they don't. (At least that's the way I recall it.) A hacked
observer could withhold information about negative credentials (e.g.
"are you a convicted felon?") but so could a hacked smartcard with
an observer in it, so that part is a wash...

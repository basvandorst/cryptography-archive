Recall that the plan is for a panel of cryptographic experts to review the
clipper algorithm, and while they won't be permitted to reveal it, they will
be permitted, nay encouraged to reveal their conclusions about its security.

By the way, to clarify one aspect of your number 4:

4a)The algorithm is so secure the US government doesn't want it to fall into
the hands of foreign intelligence targets who might use it without key.

Finally, if you read the documentation posted here, you will have seen that
they say the reason is to protect the security of the key escrow
system--i.e. reason number 4.

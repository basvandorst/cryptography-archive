I'm working on some software using the ethernet CRC-32 as a manipulation
detection code.  I am aware of MD[245] and have compared their performance,
but the CRC may be a reasonable engineering tradeoff for my application
because its signature is half the size and the computation is a bit faster.

I've heard rumor that there is some public domain code that calculates a
value that can be appended to a given file to make it produce a chosen
CRC value.  I've searched for it with archie but have been unable to
locate it.  Can anyone point out its location for me?  Thanks!

Any references to books, articles, programs for spoofing CRCs or CRC
mathematics would also be appreciated.  They would be very helpful for
testing my code.

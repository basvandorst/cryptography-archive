It does not seem too difficult do reverse-engineer the chip, even if it is
hardened. It is simply more expensive. But there are some poeple who do not
really care about the price when their business is at  stake. How to do it ?

1/ wait some time, just to let everybody think that everything is OK...
2/ highjack some truck with a few hudreds chips in it (easy to find which
   truck if you can pay some clerk. No, not ALL of them are ALWAYS honest.
3/ wait some time...
4/ export the chips in some country where the algorithm is not classified. 
   When one sees how much drug enters the developped countries, it is not
   so difficult. I would not kown how to do, but many poeple DO know...
5/ use the appropriate tools to analyse the chip. OK, some of them will be
   lost before useful info is obtained... but you have a full load of them.
6/ at your choice : build pseudo-compatible chips..., publish the algorithm
   in the local country and send it on the usenet... or any other...

About a week ago I attended a seminar that was being given by a 
mathematician/cryptographer.   At one point he brought up a 
story to illustrate a point about a way to protect anonymouity. It was
called "The Three Cryptographers".  In it three of the learned men were 
enjoying a lunch together.  When they asked for the bill, they were told 
that the meal was already payed for by a source who wished to remain 
anonymous.  The three men decided that if the meal had been payed for by 
a goeverment agency, than they didn't want to accept it.  If however it
had been payed by one of them, then they would gladly accept.  To protect
the potential anonymous payer, they came up with some sort of scheme where 
each of the three would flip two coins.  They would then XOR the results of
the flip together and then if one of the people at the table had payed, they 
would invert their answer before reporting it.  Then they would combine the 
results in some way, and if the answer came up to be 0 then no one at the table
had payed, and if it came up 1 than one of them had payed.

I'm may be off of the exact method, but it's close.  If someone knows the 
exact algorithm, I'd appreciate it if they could let me know, it's been 
bothering me all week.

Thanks,

Mark

     Nit-picking??  Those examples are preposterous on their face -- the analogy

   information in a library book is so straightforward as to make it clear that
   legal protections written for the latter must be bent into pretzel knots to
   exclude the former, while your proposed analogies already -are- bent into
   pretzel knots.
Yeah, they seemed pretty warped, though printing a few copies and donating them
to some public libraries might slow down a few pretzel-logicked prosecutors - 
the Library of Congress would seem an obvious location if they take donations,
as well as some helpful small-town library and State University if they'll put
it on open stacks, and there *are* some people who still read paper :-)

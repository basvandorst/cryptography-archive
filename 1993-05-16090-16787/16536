I have consistently challenged every person who comes to me with this
rumor or "import controls" to substantiate it.  Give me a law or a law
number.  Give me the name of a person who has been prosecuted for it,
or any reference to a court proceeding.  Give me a regulation or a
reference to one.  How about a law review article, or a newspaper report?

	NOBODY HAS!

They all slink off.  Some promise to look it up, but never do.  Others
just admit that they don't really know but they heard it from somebody.

I also read the import laws -- you can too, they are in the library.
There was a small amount of material about importing tanks and guns.
No material at all about importing cryptography or communications security
gear.

Until you hear otherwise, WITH REFERENCES YOU CAN CHECK, you can assume
that there is no law or regulation that controls the import of
cryptography into the U.S.

Bill Stewart ought to know better than to keep spreading this rumor --
I've asked HIM for his sources enough times.  He's toned it down to "It
does not appear to be illegal, but...".  Bill, it does not appear that you
are beating your wife, but have you stopped?

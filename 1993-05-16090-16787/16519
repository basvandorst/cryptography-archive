I'm looking for information on what's called in VMS documentation
as the Purdy Algorithm.  The system service $HASH_PASSWORD converts
plain ASCII into an encrypted quadword, using any of a number of VMS
algorithms, historically.  Current is UAI$_C_PURDY_S, which equates
to UAI$_C_PREFERED_ALG, the current system implementation.

The VMS documentation only says that this method of encryption is
'the Purdy algorithm over salted input'.  However, I have not been
able to find anything on "Purdy"...

Can anyone point me to documentation on 'Purdy' ? 
(please followup or email, thanks!)

I don't believe this is true.  In the past year there was a case in St. Louis
of a person murdering his daughter, which was recorded by a U.S. government
electronic surveillance device that had been installed in his house.  According
to the FBI, the reason no agent came to the daughter's assistance while
she was being killed was the recording was made automatically.  The FBI
didn't learn they had recorded the sounds of the killing until they reviewed
the tapes later.  This did not prevent the recordings from being introduced
in court.

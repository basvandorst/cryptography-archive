     It is my intent to cut the government off at the knees with the pen
   (and keyboard).  True, the lawyer and the lawbook only go so far, but
   I agree that it is best to use those resources to the maximum extent
   before seriously contemplating anything more... disruptive.

As is frequently mentioned on the libernet-digest;

Citizens options for dealing with government and laws that are out of
control:

Jury box, Ballot box, ammo box.

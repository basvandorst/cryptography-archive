   The data rate needed for good speech quality with ordinary waveform
   coding is too high for dialup modems, so special speech compression
   techniques (vocoders) are needed. This is easily the most complex part
   of any secure digital voice system desiged for ordinary phone lines.
   Until vocoders become cheap and widely available (which digital
   cellular is about to do), secure phones will remain fairly expensive
   and low volume.

It doesn't really take that much - DSPs are cheap, and you could
put a secure phone on the market today if you could get enough market
penetration to get your production volumes up.  Technology's there.
Digital cellular does have the advantage that it's already digital,
and it's probably already got DSP or some other cheap CPU available
for management functions, and encryption doesn't take much horsepower.

There are ~$1000 DSP-based speakerphones out there, which do lots of
fancy equalization to get rid of echoes, background room noises, etc.,
and several companies have announced that they'll be coming out with
products in the $300-500 range.  Current ISDN phones are in the 
$250-500 range as well, and are already carrying digital voice.
It wouldn't be hard to do an enhanced-quality-audio phone which
compresses better-than-telephone audio into 56/64 kbps,
and throws in encryption as well.

   Once vocoders are in hand, the actual encryption is easy to do in
   software - a hardware encryption chip is overkill. And at $30/each,
   the economics are (fortunately) going to be strongly against Clipper
   for low cost secure voice.

And at $15-30, DSP chips are substantially faster, perform other
functions you already need, and usually require minimal glue compared to
the support the Wiretap Chips need.  Other places for application:

- Fax machines / fax boards - aside from the scanning and printing hardware,
a fax machine is basically a data compressor plus a half-duplex modem,
and it's really easy to implement this with a DSP plus a D/A chip.
Throwing in encryption would be simple if you could agree on a standard,
and might not require more hardware (or at most some more RAM or a
somewhat faster DSP.)  It's especially cheap if you're squashing it
all onto an ASIC anyway.

- According to a recent AT&T Bell Labs Technical Journal article,
the AT&T video phone does 9.6 kbps video and 6.8 kbps audio,
wrapped in an X.25 stream over 16.8-19.2 kbps modems.
The modem is DSP + ASIC, don't remember what the video codec is,
the voice uses DSP when it's in digital mode (vanilla analog is used for 
call-setup and power-failure-fallback), and there's a 68000-relative
that handles X.25 and call setup.  That leaves several easy places to
do encryption, since 19.200 isn't that much data.

See

 `Method and Apparatus for Securing Integrated Circuits from Unauthorised
 Copying and Use', US Patent no 4,766,516, Hughes Aircraft Co, 23 Aug 1988

This is used in some military crypto (see paper by Mayhew and others entitled
`The Kinetic Protection Device' in the last NCSC proceedings). I presume that
Clipper will use something similar, and so it would be nice if someone with 
access to a US patent library could read this document and summarise it to 
the net,

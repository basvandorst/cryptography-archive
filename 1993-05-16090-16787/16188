And we should assume we will never sell one of these instruments outside the
U.S.?  There is N-O W-A-Y the French/British/Saudis/Japanese are going to let
one of these things inside their borders without being able to crack the
encryption.  I suspect they won't trustingly, and blindly, use the boxes
supplied for FBI use - unlike its dealings with the American populace,
the govs "trust me" explanation doesn't work here.

But then the xUSSR never managed to penetrate NSA or its counterparts did
it ;-( ?  And remember, twenty years ago, we would have jumped at the
opportunity to sell these to the Shah and five years ago to Sadam.  Where
would the knowledge have been then?  Probably for sale to the highest bidder.

Soviet inability to make most of the things we do stemmed more from a lack of
fabrication technology than from not knowing how to.  As far as espionage
goes, money _can_ buy happiness.  Or as Pepsi discovered when Coke dumped
"Old" Coke, so can a lot of reverse engineering (Pepsi figured out the
formula - they just couldn't get it to market before Coke gave in and
resurrected Coke Classic).

You don't hide things at this level.  If a government wants to know, it will
find out regardless of the means: murder, bribery, blackmail, theft or whatever.
They don't want US to know for the sole reason they want to force key escrow.
Ignorance is power.

   I've been looking at the articles in which the PES was proposed (by
Massey and Lai), and where the IPES was proposed (to make the PES
more resistant to differential cryptanalysis.)  The IPES later evolved into
IDEA.  Can anyone tell me when the decision was made to change the final
output transformation from (MUL ADD ADD MUL) to (XOR XOR XOR XOR)?  Does
anyone know *why* it was made?

the "author" of FEAL is Shoji Miyaguchi at NTT in Japan.  I don't have an
email for him, but his voice and fax at NTT in Japan are:
Tele 81 468 59 3377
Fax 81 468 59 3858 (Usually prefered to Japan because of time delta)
FEAL started as a SW based algorithm and has been "strengthened" by
adding additional rounds ("FEAL-8, FEAL-16...)  At least at Crypto91 they
had a prize (small) out for any successfut attack for (I think) Feal 16,
but I don't think anyone collected, and there wern't any major
announcements at that time that someone was taking them up on their
challenge.  There was allegedly a FEAL chip comming out a year ago, but I
don't know the latest.  Anybody?
Hope this helps.

   Are there any examples or discussions of differential cryptanalysis on
the net?  I've been reading through the Shamir/Biham articles in Crypto 90
and Eurocrypt '91, and the Lai/Massey/Murphy article in Eurocrypt '91, and
I'd like to dive in (now that I have a bit of free time), but I was wondering
whether there are any good net.references to illustrate the process of
attacking a product cipher this way.
 
   If my account is still alive when I get through some analysis of this,
I'll post something long and hopefully readable on it.  [The basic idea
is fairly simple, but I need to really attack something.]  Can anyone
explain to me the algorithm for LUCIFER?  [This is apparently breakable
fairly easily by differential cryptanalysis, so I'd like to try an attack
on it myself.]
 
   If I'm understanding the general idea of diff. crypt., it should be
useable to break rotor machines, too, right?  [I'm trying to think whether
the differential function would be possible to calculate....]

There's another solution with different characteristics. Let's say that
a document dated D is ``received on time'' if the receiver saw it before
date D. (We're assuming a global date system here.) You distribute a
whole bunch of dated documents. Meanwhile you distribute certain keys.
Anyone who receives some of your documents on time, and later sees your
keys, can verify that those documents were in fact all created by the
same cryptographic entity. On the other hand anyone who does not receive
a document on time will not be able to verify anything about it.

Obviously the timestamps here are useless in court. Depending what you
want timestamps for, this is either a serious advantage or a serious
disadvantage.

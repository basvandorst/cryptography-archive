There are certainly important political questions to be considered 
in the clipper debate, but several posts, including the particularly
silly example here, make the mistake of substituting a political
opinion for a technical result.  This is not how cryptology is done.

As Ronald Rivest says, cryptology is the study of communication in
an adversarial environment.  In consideration of "back doors" the
builder of the system is the potential adversary.  One would not
accept a proof of security like: "Alice can not cheat because her
problem is equivalent to factoring, and Bob can not cheat because
he's an honest person and if it ever were discovered, he'd loose
his reputation."

So let us consider the technical question of the security of clipper
from "back door" attacks.  If one considers key escrow a back door, 
then clipper definitely has one ; this fact is conceded.  But lets 
say this does not count as a back door.

Those who claim that clipper has no back door have presented no
evidence of this fact, although the same can be said of those 
claiming that there surely is a back door other than escrow.  
( I personally have not heard anyone make the latter claim.)

Are users of clipper secure from a back door ?  No.  The system 
described in Dennings posts provides no assurance  that the 
producers of the system do not save all the keys.  If they do, 
the system provides no way for users, law enforcement or 
experts who are given the algorithm to detect the fact.

This is disturbing considering that key escrow techniques in
which no one party is trusted do exist.  The clipper keying 
method seems designed to lead people to believe that no one 
party could hold the key.  In fact, after the laptop-in-a-vault
nonsense, the chip manufacturer holds the complete key in their 
own hardware.  They might as well just generate all the keys 
themselves and give the right parts to the escrow agencies.

In conclusion, the clipper key escrow techique, and therefor the
entire system, is vulverable to a back door.  That much we know.

Its even simpler than that.  Presumably the keys are generated by some
algorithm.  I don't think they'll have people throwing dice to generate
them.  So even if the keys are 80 bit pseudorandom sequences, if the
key generation algorithm and seed leak out, then crackers would only have
to search over the space of released keys, not over all 80 bit keys.
That's not a very big space and it could be searched very rapidly.

Even if the escrow agencies guard users individual keys properly, what
ensures that the space of issued keys remains secret?

Another risk is that the chip could provide a covert channel.  For instance,
the chip could modulate its digital edges a little bit and key information
could be encoded in this edge modulation.  Since the design and manufactur
of the chip is not an open process, there could be a lot hidden there.

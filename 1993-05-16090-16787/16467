Just out of curiosity, why do you guess that?

My best guess is that it uses the Macintosh's built in PRNG which, to the
best of my knowledge, is based on Park and Miller's "Minimal Standard
Random Number Generator", and has a period of 2,147,483,646.

Note that while the MSRNG is about as good as you can get for a 32-bit
multiplicative residue PRNG, it is certainly not of cryptographic quality.

The Scientific American article covers much more than digital
cash.  For example, a potential employer asks
   "Do you have any of the following:
      a) B.A. and 3 years' experience?
      b) 10 years' experience?
      c) Ph.D. and recommendations?"
and the observer answers "yes."  I don't understand how this
sort of thing could work without a tamper-proof observer.

There was a message on sci.crypt about using quantum effects for secure key
interchange.  Essentially, A and B can both receive the same random bit
stream, knowing that if X taps the communication link, the bits will be
scrambled.  This basically depends on the fact that (under quantum
mechanics) that you can't "clone" a particle retaining its quantum state. 
If Sarfatti is correct, that may not be the case.  (I don't think he's
correct, either, but it is relevant to sci.crypt).

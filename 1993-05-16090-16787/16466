Two things:  (1) there is no guarantee, since we can't see the
algorithm, that the remaining clipper cipher is secure and lacks back
doors, perhaps of a subtle kind, such as limiting the keyspace
actually used.

and (2) there is no guarantee that communications systems will pass
data with an invalid LEF.  My guess is that eventually, and perhaps
even initially, the LEF will be checked on transmission for validity,
using the IV as a verification that the block was created by a real
clipper chip with the correct system key F.

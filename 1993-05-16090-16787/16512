That's an interesting possibility.  Are there any public algorithms
with this property?  Kind of a "proof of concept"?  An encryption
algorithm with a small set of strong keys (very low probability of
getting one of these at random) would be very interesting....

I vaguely remember that when there was a lot of speculation about
back doors being built into DES, someone showed that it was indeed
possible to pick the values for the S-boxes in such a way that a
back door was introduced.

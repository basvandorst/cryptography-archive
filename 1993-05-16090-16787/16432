     How could you beat such a scheme without knowledge of the error-correcting
     code?   

 One of the first assumptions in cryptography is that the enemy knows
 the algorithm.  This doesn't answer the question, just points out that
 the question is not well defined given the basic assumptions.  (i.e.
 "I don't know").

 Who is more likely to stop the government from pushing 'The Button' -
 nonviolent protesters crying around the peace tree, or nasty individuals
 saying 'Go ahead and push the f---ing button.  We're heavily armed, well
 prepared, and ready to hunt your ass down after the fallout settles'?

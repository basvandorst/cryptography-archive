        Good. That leaves "digital cash" to describe what is not
        included in the above: an anonomous, currency-equivalent smart
        card cryptographically loaded with legal tender.
        
        Since the protocols for doing this are still on the challenge
        list, sci.crypt does seem the right place to discuss it.

        Cheers,
                Marc

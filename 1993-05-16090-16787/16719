I should point out that the Videocipher II has a *hardware* DES chip.
It's only slightly more reasonable to attempt to control the export of
special-purpose hardware, since it cannot be cloned as easily as a
computer program.

This case most likely involved organized piracy of encrypted satellite
TV signals. The prosecution probably used the ITAR controls on
encryption equipment simply as a convenient expedient than out of real
concern that a Videocipher unit could be used to encrypt anything (as
opposed to decrypting satellite TV).

Nevertheless, despite ITAR, Videocipher units are quite common in
Latin America.

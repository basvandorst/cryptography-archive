Hi All,

May be this is the wrong group, but I've already posted to comp.os.dos.*
without success. Here is the problem :
One of my friend is using stacker to gain disk space, and he has recently
decided to set up a password. Bad Idea !!! Surely because he made a typo
while entering the password, he has been unable to retype it correctly
later when restarting his PC (right, he has a PC, Dos 5.0 and Stacker 3.0).

Well, now he has no more access to his stacked drive, containing 240 MB of
valuable datas... Can someone tell me if there is a known way of removing
this password, and explain me what is encrypted by Stacker (maybe nothing
is encrypted, and the password is just used to control access) ?

Please send me any information concerning the password and Stacker 3.0,
Thanks a lot in advance,


Paul Rolland

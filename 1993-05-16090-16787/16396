My Pascal code for solving monoalphabetic substitution ciphers using probab-
ilistic relaxation is available anonymous FTP on ripem.msu.edu as 
 
     pub/crypt/other/solve-monoalphabetic-cryptologia-july92.pascal.tar.Z

C code will be available at a later date.  There was a lot of interest on the
Pascal code so I will make another post when the C code is available.

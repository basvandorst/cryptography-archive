The subject of this thread is `Import Controls' ..., I was aware of
export controls from the USA - The SunOS des(1) command man page is present on
my system but I cant find the command itself :-(.

Can someone clarify whether the various bits of US statutes/regulations
governing encryption refer to Import or Export ( or both ) and what the
status of DES is if I have the source to an implentation of des(1) originating
outside the USA. ( I havent tested it for confomance against the original
Sun version. )
Quoting the manpage of the C library
"This has been implemented from FIPS publication 46 which I has been in my
local library for several years."
I dont know what FIPS is, so I cant say if it is a publication or not

regards
JonT

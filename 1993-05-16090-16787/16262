I'm trying to figure out what is the deal with the RSA, PKP, PGP and so
forth.  In efforts to do just that, I have ftp the privious mentioned
site:
CHIRALITY.RSA.COM
And found a slew(?) of literature about their object to make the PKP
open to the public, and not "just privicy for outlaws."  (Not their
quote)  They had a large document about what they are doing to make this
program available.  Mainly, making a standard for it (PKCS) that it also
compatible with PEM (Can't be that good then :)  Here is a bit from a
text they have called announcement.txt  Since it is on an anonymous ftp
server, (not the incoming dir)  I figure it's ok to put some of it up
here.
---------
RSA Data Security, Inc. is pleased to announce PKCS: Public-Key
Cryptography Standards, a suite of standards for public-key
cryptography developed jointly with representatives of industry and
universities. PKCS covers RSA encryption, Diffie-Hellman key
agreement, password-based encryption, extended-certificate syntax,
cryptographic enhancement syntax, and private-key information syntax.

As public-key cryptography begins to see wide application and
acceptance one thing is increasingly clear: If it is going to be as
effective as the underlying technology allows it to be, there must be
interoperable standards. Even though vendors may agree on the basic
public-key techniques, compatibility between implementations is by no
means guaranteed. Interoperability requires strict adherence to an
agreed-upon standard format for transferred data. PKCS provides such
a basis for interoperability.

The standards presented here evolved from the following broad design
goals:

1.  To maintain compatibility with PEM (the Internet Privacy Enhanced
    Mail standard) wherever possible, at least to the extent of being
    able to share certificates and to translate encrypted and/or
    signed messages back and forth between PEM and PKCS.

2.  To extend beyond PEM in being able to handle arbitrary binary
    data (not just ASCII data), to handle a richer set of attributes
    in (extended) certificates, to handle Diffie-Hellman key
    agreement, and to handle a richer set of features in digitally
    signed and enveloped data.

3.  To propose a standard suitable for incorporation in future OSI
    (Open Systems Interconnection) standards. The standards here are
    based on the use of OSI standard ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation
    One) and BER (Basic Encoding Rules) to describe and represent
    data.

PKCS describes the syntax for messages in an abstract manner, and
gives complete details about algorithms. However, it does not specify
..............
and so forth----cut
I would like people to get this document, and read it.  Does this mean
that a 'good' PGP like program will be available?  (For a sum?:)  Are
they actually letting the public 'legally' run pgp?  (To a degree)  Does
this mean that the NSA has cracked the PGP?  I would like those with
legal opinions to post their views of the documents provided, as well as
those on the anonymous ftp site OSIRIS.MIT.EDU.  (I have not been able
to connect yet.)  I also want to hear from anyone in the know (RSA, PKP,
hackers, reg folk) what they think.  And finally, is the source code for
pgp legit, if it is just used for educational purposes?  Thanks...
(Please post here if possible)

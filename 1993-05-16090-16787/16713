Well no. It involved an experiment in which "excess
heat" was generated. No no theory believed by more than the
author was ever advanced, and no known physics could explain
the claimed excess heat (including "cold fusion:)
(More careful experiments saw no excess heat as well).

Quantum cryptography on the other hand is a trivial first year
application of quantum mechanics. The technology is however very
difficult to produce, and if your link is good enough to maintain the 
quantum coherence needed, it is almost certainly good enough to be used
as a standard secret channel. I suspect the quantum returns will be
minor, but then I know quantum mechanics, not cryptography. So cold
fusion is highly significant if true, but wrong, while quantum
cryptography is certainly right, but of shall we say unproven
significance.

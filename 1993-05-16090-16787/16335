I wasn't going to post on this again, but (a) I was unclear,
and (b) I've gotten a few emails about it... 

Althought the law does not specify research as an excuse for
infringing a patent, there is some case law to that effect.
But, I believe that the cases are very picky about the
research truely being research.

I think that anyone using PGP for email would be hard pressed to
convince a jury that this was research into the patent.  Even more
clear would be a port of PGP, say to the Mac.  It's hard to convince
someone that to understand the patent in question you had to make
the program useable on a different machine.  That alone makes it clear
that you intended people to use it.

So, depending on where you are (I don't recall the jurisdiction of the
case law -- it might be a precedent throughout the US or not) you can
claim research (if it is truely research) as why you built and used a
patented device.  But they can be very picky about it, and there is nothing
in the law itself covering this.

For having been too brief and too unclear, I appologize.  I think, however,
that in the case of PGP, the idea of research use into the patent is not
a likely excuse (perhaps for a few people, but...).

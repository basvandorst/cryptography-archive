I know little of the Clipper & don't normally read these news groups,
so I'll ask a little before I write my president. It seems to me from a
crook's point of view that Uncle Sam's patented encryption scheme is
a noop, i.e.:

my crooked data sent -> encrypt -> transport -> decrypt -> my crooked data rcvd

is logically equivalent to

my crooked data sent -> transport -> my crooked data rcvd

in terms of keeping my crooked data private. If "there exists some unknown
listener such that the listener can decrypt my message," that is just
as bad for a crook as "for all unknown listeners each listener can decrypt
my message." Uncle Sam's encryption-decryption is effectively neutral overhead
on the net, perhaps a parasite but probably not in and of itself a malignant
one.

An enterprising crook simply wraps his own encryption/decryption layer
around Uncle Sam's inefficient transport system, treating the latter
as a noop. Is this wrapping another layer of encryption the illegal
part? If so it's a little silly because,

IF I get 10 to 20 for the crooked content of my message
	AND I get 1 to 2 for do-it-yourself encryption
THEN
	I hire an underpaid hacker for do-it-yourself encryption
	and risk the 1 to 2

Anybody who deals in crime for a living surely ain't gonna flinch at
encryption laws. Is Uncle Sam that dumb, or am I missing something?
All the law succeeds in doing is creating a black market for encryption
expertise, and laying open legitimate folks who don't break encryption
laws to industrial and personal espionage wherever the unknown decryption
scheme leaks. It doesn't appear to do much for catching the high rollers
of the underworld.

I'm sure these groups have discussed encryption laws to extremes so
we needn't do it again, but it seems like someone's passing a law
that stops me from saying $%!!@(() because they can't attach semantics
to $%!!@(() (presumably this message HAS a meaning, but perhaps it's
just a decoy) is on shaky legal grounds. Remember the Navajo code
talkers in WWII? Am I now prohibited from conversing in a language
which may be unknown to the federal govt? That sounds suspiciously
like restriction on freedoms of press and speech.

I predict a rise in the number of people studying encryption techniques
and language synthesis as the first big effect of such a govt. move,
followed by bootleg languages out the proverbial wazoo. If you have
a multitude of encryption techniques, they don't even have to be good ones.
Good old combinatorial explosion.

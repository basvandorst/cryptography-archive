<H3>Random numbers</H3>
<P>PGP uses a cryptographically strong pseudorandom number generator for
creating temporary conventional session keys.  The seed file for this
is called  <VAR>randseed.bin</VAR>.  It too can be kept in whatever directory
is indicated by the PGPPATH environmental variable.  If this random
seed file does not exist, it is automatically created and seeded with
truly random numbers derived from timing your keystroke latencies.  
<P>This generator reseeds the disk file each time it is used by mixing
in new key material partially derived with the time of day and other
truly random sources.  It uses the conventional encryption algorithm
as an engine for the random number generator.  The seed file contains
both random seed material and random key material to key the
conventional encryption engine for the random generator.
<P>This random seed file should be at least slightly protected from
disclosure, to reduce the risk of an attacker deriving your next or
previous session keys.  The attacker would have a very hard time
getting anything useful from capturing this random seed file, because
the file is cryptographically laundered before and after each use. 
Nonetheless, it seems prudent to at least try to keep it from falling
into the wrong hands.
<P>If you feel uneasy about trusting any algorithmically derived random
number source however strong, keep in mind that you already trust the
strength of the same conventional cipher to protect your messages. 
If it's strong enough for that, then it should be strong enough to
use as a source of random numbers for temporary session keys.  Note
that PGP still uses truly random numbers from physical sources
(mainly keyboard timings) to generate long-term public/secret key
pairs.

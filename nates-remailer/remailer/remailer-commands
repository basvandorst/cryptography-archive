Commands that should be issued outside of the external encryption envelope:

::               Sends the text file you are reading now.  No other
SendInformation  information is needed (the remailer looks at the 
		 header for the sender's email address).

::               Tells the remailer to decrypt the message.  This *MUST*
Encrypted: PGP   be used if you are not asking for information.  All mail
		 routed through the remailer must be encrypted at least 
		 once.  If this tag is not present, the mail will either
		 get stuck in the owner's mailbox or will get trashed.

Commands that should be included inside the first encryption envelope:

::               Tells the remailer that the message to be sent out 
Encrypted: PGP   needs to be decrypted once more.  The message should
		 have been encrypted with the remailer's public key.

::                  Tells the remailer that the given subject is to be
Subject: <subject>  used instead of the default one set by the operator.
		    The original subject of the message will *not* be
		    used.

::                   Instructs the remailer that it should wait the specified
Latency: ## MINUTES  number of minutes before it sends the mail out.  ##
		     can be an integer or the word "RANDOM" to specify a 
		     random latency between 0 and the remailer's maximum
		     latency.  If the latency is greater than the set
		     maximum, the maximum will be used instead.

::               Tells the remailer not to use message padding on the
PleaseDontPad    message.  By default, the remailer adds a section of
		 garbage to the end of the message as it's going out.
		 This should only be used for the last hop in a chain
		 for cosmetic purposes.

::                                     Old faithful.  Specifies the email
Request-Remailing-To: <user@machine>   address that the message should be
				       sent to.  Mail *cannot* be delivered
				       if this is not specified.

There are two things you need to edit:

your ~/.forward file to be something like this:
|/home/yourname/remailer/remailer.pl

and edit the first variable in the remailer.pl script to
point at your particular rc file.

Then, look through the remailerrc file and edit the
necessary declarations.

If you are using some filter program (like elm's filter, which I use),
you can still have your mail filtered...  just modify the 
dumptombox subroutine like this:

sub dumptombox {
  print DEBUG "No commands... putting mail into $mbox.\n" if ($debug > 0);
  #if (!(-e "$mbox")) {
    #system "touch $mbox";
    #}
  #open(MBOX, ">>$mbox");
  #flock(MBOX, 2);
  #seek(MBOX, 0, 2);
  #print MBOX join("", @message) . "\n\n";
  #close(MBOX);
  open(FILTER, "|/usr/local/bin/filter -o /u1/nates/filter-problems");
  print FILTER join("", @message) . "\n\n";
  close(FILTER);
  close(DEBUG);
  exit 0;
  }

Just edit the actual filter you want to use, and mail not run through the
remailer will be sent to the filter.

available by finger if you feel it necessary to use it.

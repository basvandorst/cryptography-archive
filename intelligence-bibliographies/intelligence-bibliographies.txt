1.      Bibliographies



	Among the most useful bibliographies are the "Bibliography of
	Intelligence Literature" published by the Defense Intelligence
	College (8th ed. 1985); "Intelligence and Espionage: an Analytical
	Bibliography" by George C. Constantinides (1983): and
	"Bibliography on Soviet Intelligence and Security Services," by
	Raymond Rocca, John Dziak, and the staff of the Consortium for
	the Study of Intelligence (1985).  Another bibliographic
	reference, which selectively catalogs recent intelligence
	literature, is "Comparing Foreign Intelligence: The U.S.,
	USSR UK and the Third World edited by Roy Godson (1988).

	Additional bibliographies on intelligence include the
	following:

	*Blackstock, Paul W and Schaf, Frank L. jr. Intelligence,
	Espionage, Counterespionage, and Covert Operations: A Guide to
	Information Sources.  Detroit, Michigan: Gale Research Co., 1978.
	255 p.  (Note: some of you may be aware that the director of
	my august organization used to be a Very Senior Person at Gale,
	this should not imply any attempts at influence.  He also used
	to work for Harlequin, I defy you to find any recommendations for
	them in here - Alec.)

	*Russell J. Bowen Collection - Georgetown University Library

	The Bowen Collection at the Georgetown UL contains over
	8,000 cataloged and 3,000 uncataloged intelligence-related
	titles and is still growing.  A bibliography of over 5,000
	of the titles by 372 categories is "A Scholar's Guide to
	Intelligence Literature:  Bibliography of the Russell J. Bowen
	Collection, Marjorie W. Cline et al., eds (Frederick, Maryland:
	University Publications of America, 1983).

	The Collection has recently been entered into a database
	permitting key-word search to access over 8,000 titles.  By
	1994, over 11,000 titles are expected to be cataloged.  Almost half
	of the entries contain summaries of the book, followed by a
	listing of important names and references in the text.  The
	database can be purchased from the National Intelligence Book
	Center, 1700 K Street NW, Washington, DC, 20006 202/785-4334
	for $400.  The Georgetown U. Special Collections Dept. has
	the database installed on its computer, and it is available for
	use by the public.  Contact: George Berringer, (202) 687-7475.

	*Canadian Peace Research Institute.  Peace Research Abstracts

	This bibliography contains commentary on over 500 volumes in
	English.  It covers the history of US and European intelligence
	operations from the 17th Century to the early 1980s.  The
	commentary on each book is designed to provide a guide to the
	usefulness and accuracy of the work; the reliability of the
	central themes or principal issues investigated; and the extent
	to which the subject has been thoroughly examined.  Cross references
	in the text pinpoint works dealing with identical or related subjects.
	(I have used this book and can recommend it strongly.)

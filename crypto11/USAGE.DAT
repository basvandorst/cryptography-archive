Test Driver for Crypto++, a C++ Class Library of Cryptographic Primitives:

- To calculate MD5 and SHS message digests:
    cryptest m file

- To encrypt or decrypt using DES-EDE in CBC mode:
    cryptest e|d input output

- To share a file into shadows:
    cryptest s <pieces> <pieces-needed> file
    (make sure file has no extension, if you're running this under DOS)

- To reconstruct a file from shadows:
    cryptest j output file1 file2 [....]

- To gzip a file:
    cryptest g <compression-level> input output

- To gunzip a file:
    cryptest u input output

- To run validation tests:
    cryptest v

- To run benchmarks:
    cryptest b [length]

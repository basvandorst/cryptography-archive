      Request an Evaluation Key File by E-mail to Fully Test ZipNews!
      ---------------------------------------------------------------

      To order a 10-day evaluation key file send e-mail to:

      file-server@nlbbs.com

      Include the following 3 lines of text in the body of the message:

      password ZipNews
      evaluation johnd John Q. Doe
      quit

      Substitute for "johnd" above your login or username (and this must
      match the "username" specified in your reader setup).  Substitute
      for "John Q. Doe" your name as you'd like it to appear on the
      "From:" lines of your messages.  The above example, if John were
      calling the site, nlbbs.com, would result in his message "From:" lines
      looking like this:

      From: johnd@nlbbs.com (John Q. Doe)

      (You don't have to specify a middle initial or name...just include the
      full name you'd like to go by.)

      Also, in specifying the password on the first line, the password is
      case-sensitive.  So capaitalize "ZipNews" exactly as shown.

      After receipt of a correct message by our file-server an automated
      reply containing your 10-day evaluation key will be sent during the next
      UUCP session.  It will be contained within a uuencoded ZIP file.  The
      evaluation key will allow complete evaluation of all registered
      features of the ZipNews reader, v0.92w and later versions.

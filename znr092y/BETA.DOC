                   The ZipNews Reader v0.92y (BETA)

The ZipNews Reader provides fully threaded newsreading of Usenet and other
newsgroups distributed via the Internet.  It obtains its news packets from
the ZipNews Door.  The system operates in a manner quite similar to the
QWK-compatible readers and doors.  A big difference is the accessability to
the fantastic Internet in a familiar and easy manner.  There is no compromise
in Internet functionality by having to traverse a gateway.  There are no
addressing kludges that must be mastered in order to force some measure of
compatiblity between the one format (such as QWK) to the pure Internet/Usenet
format as per the standards set forth in RFC-822 and RFC-1036.

This reader provides for the selection of newsgroups and the maintenance of
last article read pointers from remote via packet upload.  Use the "Setup"
menu in the reader, "News Selection".   To add/delete newsgroups, you must
first obtain a list of those available from the BBS through which you
access the ZipNews door.   You request the list from the door (if v0.96e or
later) by choosing C)onfigure from the door menu, cycle through the various
options, and answer Y to the prompt asking if you wish a list of the
newsgroups.

When you first use the ZipNews Door accessed from a PCBoard or Wildcat!
BBS, you are prompted to register your Internet login ID with the door.
You also are given an opportunity to choose the archiving utility to be
used to compress your news, the file transfer protocol to be used, and
whether Internet e-mail is to be included in your packet (available from
registered versions of the ZipNews door, and usable by registered versions
of this reader).

A successfully completed download results in a *.ZNS file being received in
your download directory.  From the Northern Lights, you will receive
NLBBS.ZNS files.  Before attempting to work with such a file, run
INSTALL.EXE.  And, if you are using a registered copy, copy ZNREADER.KEY to
the same directory you have chosen for your ZipNews executables.  You do NOT
need to have a registered copy or ZNREADER.KEY to obtain full newsreading
capability from the reader.

Should you choose to register your ZipNews Reader, it becomes a mailer as
well.  This will allow you to use your own editor to compose postings to
newsgroups and private mail messages and replies to sent via the Internet.
The registered reader also can read your Internet E-mail messages downloaded
from a registered ZipNews Door.  The reader not only integrates with your
favorite editor, but it may integrate also with a spell checker of your
choice, and with a public/private key encryption system of your choice.
(See ZNRORDER.FRM for information on how to register your reader.)

To try out the reader with an evaluator's key (versions 0.92w and later),
see ORDERING.KEY in the distribution archive.

To install the ZipNew reader, merely unZIP the distribution archive into
a work directory and enter the command:  INSTALL

Fill in the fields that are pertinent to your operation, save, and exit.
Note that hitting F1 at the entry of any configuration parameter will
provide a unique help screen with more info regarding use and specification
of that parameter.

Here are the basics of running your reader:

1. Use a packet (nlbbs.zns) produced ONLY in ZipNews Reader Format by the
ZipNews Door (or on Unix systems by uqwk 1.7 or later).  After downloading
with your usual communications program, it should be in the directory you
have named as the "incoming" directory in ZNREADER.CFG.

2. Invoke the newsreader with the command:  znr
To access the packet, pick IMPORT - NEW in the reader's menuing scheme.
Thereafter, I think you'll see how to use the reader.

3. Once you have finished with a packet, you may "store" it away along with
info indicating which articles of the total packet remain unread.  To
"store", pick EXPORT - STORE.   To re-access this packet, merely choose
IMPORT - RETRIEVE.  Simple, huh?

4. When you quit out of the Group Selection screen, or when quitting
out of the reader entirely, you may re-enter the newsreading mode very
quickly by choosing NEWS - READ.   This will bring things up
instantly, bypassing the re-generation of the index files since they
exist in the current directory.   Should you ever have to re-index
a packet, select INDEX. (This option is provided should you manually
unarchive a packet and place its contents in the current directory.
To bring up the articles in readable form you would have to use INDEX.)

Within each major area of the newsreader operation (showing/selecting
groups, or threads, or reading an article) there is a unique help screen
indicating the action keys.  Hit "h" or "?" or "F1" to invoke the help.

5. If you are using a registered form of the reader, there is a MAIL
section that operates pretty much like the NEWS section.  Look at the
help screens at the various levels to see what commands are available.
(The commands pertaining to the posting or follow-up of news, and the
commands dealing with various mailing operations are not functional
in the unregistered form of the reader.)

Beginning with the v0.92b release of the software the Waffle Sysop's LOCAL
mode of operation is supported.  The reader can be used locally on Waffle
BBSs for newsreading (and, with the registered version of the reader, for
posting news follow-ups, and for various e-mail operation).  This is bound
to become a very popular tool for Waffle sysops AND their callers via the
ZipNews Door.  (Sysops:  Please read WHATSNEW.92y for more on operating this
software in local mode on your system, it is first introduced in the v0.92b
section.)   Version 0.92e of the reader provides for a unique, new feature
of LOCAL mode operation, that of "accumulating" news.  When using the
"Accumulate" sub-function of IMPORT, new news articles are added to the
indices built earlier, so that you can accumulate several days worth of
news to and readily refer back to older articles in threads of interest.
This feature is not available in the normal packet reading mode of the
reader.

Although this software product is still in beta testing, most functons
are working solidly.  I hope you like the product.  Please let us know
of any problems you encounter with the reader.

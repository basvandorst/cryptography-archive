NEW FEATURES IN PGP

1.  PGPnet. PGPnet is a landmark product in the
    history of PGP. PGPnet secures all TCP/IP
    communications between the local machine and any 
    other machine running PGPnet. PGPnet has been 
    successfully tested with Cisco routers (requires 
    Cisco IOS 12.0(4) or later with IPSec TripleDES). 

2.  Self-Decrypting Archives. You may now encrypt
    files or folders into Self-Decrypting Archives
    (SDAs) that can be used by users who do not even
    have PGP. The archives are completely independent
    of any application, compressed and protected by
    PGP's strong cryptography.

3.  Integrated PGP Command Line. This version
    incorporates the popular command line version of
    PGP for Windows platforms. This product provides
    a convenient way to integrate PGP with other 
    Windows applications and automated processes
    on your desktop system. Please note that this 
    is intended for single user/workstation use. For 
    use on servers, customers are required to purchase 
    the PGP e-Business Server product. Please contact 
    your local Network Associates Sales representative 
    for more information.

4.  Automated Freespace Wiping. PGP's Freespace Wipe
    feature now allows you to use the Windows Task
    Scheduler to schedule periodic secure wiping 
    of the free space on your disk.

5.  Hotkeys. The Use Current Window feature has been
    significantly enhanced by the addition of Hotkeys.
    By using a configured key combination, the
    Encrypt/Decrypt/Sign functions can be automatically
    invoked without using PGPtray. This feature is very 
    useful for users using messaging applications for 
    which PGP does not currently have a plug-in, such 
    as Netscape Messenger.

6.  Fingerprint Word List. When verifying a PGP public
    key fingerprint, you can now choose to view the
    fingerprint as a word list instead of hexadecimal
    characters. The word list in the fingerprint text
    box is made up of special authentication words that
    PGP uses and are carefully selected to be 
    phonetically distinct and easy to understand 
    without phonetic ambiguity.

7.  Support for Outlook 2000 and Outlook Express 5.0.
    This version of PGP adds support for sending and 
    receiving encrypted email in Microsoft Outlook 2000 
    and Outlook Express 5.0.

8.  HTTP Proxy Support. If you are behind a 
    firewall with an HTTP proxy server, PGP now 
    supports accessing HTTP keyservers through the 
    proxy.  To use this feature, you must configure 
    the proxy server address in your Internet Explorer 
    preferences.

9.  Smart Word Wrapping. The word wrapping in PGP now
    automatically rewraps paragraphs and even quoted
    paragraphs resulting in much cleaner signed 
    messages.


* PGP VERSION 6.5.2a ENHANCEMENTS *

1. Support for Windows 2000 operating systems. This 
   release of PGP introduces support for Microsoft's
   latest releases of Windows. All PGP functionality is
   available in Windows 2000 except PGPnet. PGPnet will 
   support Windows 2000 in future releases of PGP.

2. Windows 2000 IPSec interoperability. PGPnet 
   running on non-Windows 2000 systems can establish 
   VPN connections with the built-in Windows 2000 
   IPSec client.  (The Windows 2000 system must be 
   running the Windows 2000 High Encryption Pack.)

3. Intel Pentium III Random Number Generator (RNG) 
   support. If your computer is equipped with the 
   Intel RNG, PGP will use the random data generated by
   the chip in addition to our own entropy collection 
   whenever random data is needed for key generation 
   and encryption. The Intel RNG is currently only 
   available with select Pentium III chipsets, 
   including the Intel 810 chipset.

4. Automatic email plug-in pre-selection. PGP will now
   automatically pre-select email plug-ins to install on
   your system based on what messaging applications
   are installed. Nevertheless, you are still 
   able to change the selected plug-ins at install time.

KNOWN ISSUES

*PGP ISSUES*

1.  Mismatching your keyring files can result in 
    data loss. Your public keyring file and private 
    keyring file must be kept in sync.  If, for 
    instance, you select a public keyring file that
    does not contain the public portion of your 
    private key without also changing the private 
    keyring to the corresponding file, you and 
    others will not be able to encrypt to exported 
    versions of your key after that time. In most 
    cases, simply updating your key from a public 
    copy on a keyserver will fix this.  However, it 
    is recommended that the keyring files always be
    kept in sync. A future version is expected 
    to correct this issue.

2.  Some PGP Versions 6.0 and later features are 
    incompatible with previous versions of PGP, so 
    we feature a "compatible" export format that 
    strips incompatible features such as Photo IDs. 
    Selecting "Include 6.X Extensions" in the 
    Export dialog enables these features to be 
    exported. By default, PGP exports in compatible 
    mode. You may change the default in the Advanced 
    Preferences dialog. When sending a key to a 
    PGP Certificate Server Version 2.0 or above, 
    Photo IDs always accompany the key. The default 
    LDAP server in PGP 6.x supports this.

3.  On Windows 95/98, the Free Space Wiper will 
    reset every time another program writes to your 
    disk while the wiping process is in progress. 
    This is similar to defragmentation programs, 
    and is required by the Operating System. For 
    optimal wiping, make sure to close all open 
    applications. On some systems with very low 
    amounts of RAM, it may be advisable to also
    shut down Windows Explorer.

4.  The Windows Explorer provides PGP with 
    information only about the target of a shortcut 
    and not the shortcut itself. If you use the 
    Wipe feature in the Explorer, the shortcut 
    itself will not be wiped. The actual target 
    will be wiped. When using PGPtools, the shortcut 
    will also be wiped.

5.  Hotkeys are for use with applications that 
    support general text editing. Using Hotkeys 
    with some applications may result in 
    unpredictable behavior.  

6.  The PGP Exchange/Outlook plugin does not support 
    Microsoft Word as an email editor.

7.  We strongly recommend that VirusScan users
    upgrade to VirusScan Version 4.0.3 or later to
    take advantage of the newest virus DAT file 
    update features.


* PGPNET ISSUES *

1.  Do not attempt to manually uninstall PGPnet. 
    It is very important that you use the PGP 
    Uninstaller to remove PGPnet. PGPnet makes 
    extensive modifications to the registry and 
    changes the bindings on network adapters. 
    The PGP Uninstaller can be accessed via the 
    Add/Remove Programs control panel.

2.  [Windows NT only]
    As a precautionary measure, in the unusual 
    event that there is a incompatibility between 
    your network card driver and PGPnet, you can 
    create a "No Networking" hardware profile 
    prior to installing PGPnet on your system. 
    The "No Networking" hardware profile can be 
    used later if an incompatibility occurs.
 
    To create a "No Networking" hardware profile,
    right click on "My Computer," select Properties,
    and then select the Hardware Profiles tab. Use 
    the Copy button to create a copy of the Original 
    Configuration. Get Properties on your copied 
    configuration and click the Network tab.
    Finally, select the "Network-disabled hardware
    profile" checkbox. Click OK to both windows 
    and then you are done. (Due to a Windows bug 
    we recommend that you restart once and 
    double-check that the "No Networking" 
    configuration is working before you
    install PGPnet.)

3.  [Windows 95 only]
    You may experience a loss of networking after
    resuming from standby mode. You must reboot 
    your machine to resume network activity.

4.  PGPnet is not compatible with the Intel 
    EtherExpress 16 driver.   
    
5.  Installing virtual private network software 
    such as PGPnet on the same machine as a firewall
    or another VPN client is highly likely to cause
    problems. We recommend uninstalling the other
    product prior to installing or choosing not to
    install PGPnet on such a machine.

6.  You cannot use the default MSN dialer to 
    connect to MSN if PGPnet is installed.
    To connect to MSN with PGPnet, use the Microsoft 
    Dial-Up Networking client.

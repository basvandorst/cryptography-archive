To use this c++ method, declare a class like so:

		blow_this b(18/*number of elements in P*/);

Set a buffer with your keystring.  A buffer has two elements,
a character buffer, and a buffer length:


typedef struct{
	char	*buff;/* buffer */
	int	N; /* Number of elements in buffer */
} BUFFER;


For the key, N will be the key length.

Then set your subkey data with your key, like so:

		b.initbf(key);

Where key is of type BUFFER, and key.buff is your keystring.


Note:  If you want to change the key, starting with the original
       subkey data, all that you need to do is call initbf again.

       The original subkey data is copied, so it is always available.
       I.e., you do not need to declare another blow_this class if
       you wish to change the key.

NOTE:  Allgined buffers are not supported, but they are risky.
       Do not use them unless you understand how a computer
       may convert four bytes to a UINT32...

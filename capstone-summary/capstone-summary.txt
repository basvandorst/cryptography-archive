Well, for anyone whose interested, here's a summary of the Capstone from
Mykotronx's own brochure.  The Brochure is a single glossy sheet.  The
front has a picture of a MYK-80 chip, S/N 000000414.  (Do they really
think they are going to need a billion serial numbers? :-)  Also the
following text.

CAPSTONE MYK-80

A New Breakthrough in Encryption Technology

Capstone offers today's most advanced encryption and authentication
technology for digitized voice, data, facsimilie, EFT, EDI, and network
communication available in a single IC.  Capstone (known as the MYK-80)
is a member of the Key Escrow Microcircuit family.  Capstone features
fully-selectable keys to assure system security.  (Does this mean I can
choose a new unit- and family-key? NOT!)

MYK-80 FEATURES:

-Confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity with non-repudiation.

-Double Level Metal 1.0u CMOS Technology.

-Four cryptographic operating modes (FIPS Pub 81).

-On-board non-deterministic randomizer.

-Performs NIST Digital Signature & Secure Hash Standards.

-Message Encryption Key generation.

-Public Key Exchange up to 1024 bits.

-Key cover and uncover.

-Built-in self test assures system integrity.

-2^80 (or 1.2 x 10^24) possible selectable keys.

-Exportable in products meeting the NIST FIPS Pub 140.1 and government
approval.

MYK-80

Designed by Mykotronx, Inc., manufactured by VLSI Technology, INC., and
programmed by Mykotronx, Inc., the MYK-80 features a complete 32-bit
RISC-based cryptographic processor.  A Type 2 government
encryption/decryption algorithm - called "Skipjack" - is implemented with
an 80-bit cryptovariable key.  The MYK-80 also implements NIST Digital
Signature and Secure Hash Standards.

by eight triangles, labeled Secure Logic, vROM 512x32, Expo 1024, RISC
ARM 6, Skipjack, RAM 256x32, Randomizer.

Specifications:

- Cyrptographic modes: 64-bit ECB, 64-bit CBC, 8/16/32/64-bit CFB, and
64-bit OFB.

-Two package configurations: 176-pin TQFP (shown) & 180-pin CPGA (1.575"
x 1.575" x 0.25")

-Processing rate: ECB at 12 Mbps and CBC at 10 Mbps.

-RISC processor: 32-bit ARM 6 running at 18 MIPS.

-Max system clock rate: 20MHz

- Power dissipation: 20mW/MHz at 5VDC (approx.)

- Operational temperature range: 0deg to 85deg.  (Note: there is no
indication of scale, so I would assume it's Celsisus)

- Operating voltage: Vdd = 5 V +/- 10%

- 32-bit data and address busses.

- TTL I/O compatible and low power.

Pin Configuration:

indication of which pins are which, etc.]

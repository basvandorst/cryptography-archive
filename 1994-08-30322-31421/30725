How fast is Curve Encrypt 1.1?

Here are times to encrypt and DOD Wipe a 685,557 byte file on various
Macintoshes (System 7.1, booted with extensions off).  Disk speed is the
driver for wiping encrypted files, of course.  A fast non-fragmented disk
can also shave a percent or two off of encryption times (I used the
fastest disk on each Mac for my tests). Otherwise, the faster your CPU,
the better.

Native code on PowerMacs really blazes, even on my crude development port
to PowerPC.  Version 1.2 of Curve Encrypt will be buildable for PowerMacs
(at least using the Metrowerks compiler).  Be patient, for it is coming
soon to an export-controlled, Free-World-prohibited ftp site near you.

Compiler notes:

The Think C 7.0.3 was upgraded from version 6 via the patches on umich and
sumex-aim archives.  (I'm still pissed about Symantec's $100-too-high
pricing on an "upgrade" to a broken product, and won't buy a completely
new copy again like I stupidly did for version 6.  In fact, the only thing
that keeps me using Symantec stuff at all is CMaster 2.0, from Jersey
Scientific.  Ahem, sorry about the rant.  But get CMaster. :-)
The Think C 5.0.4 was my last stable version of THINK C.
The Metrowerks 68k was 1.0.1, from the CW 3.5 release
The Metrowerks PPC was 1.0.1, from the CW 3.5 release

Patentable and yet cannot be patented. I guess that means his statement
was false, yet not false.

BTW, IDEA (patented in Europe) was licensed for use in PGP. RSA was not
(until recently), and then only for U.S. use. But that's of little
consequences to European users, since there's no European patent, and
thus, no legal need to license. (Hopefully, most readers know this by now.)

You can use it, but you can't use it. Doesn't that clear things up?

:-). Actually, meanwhile I recalled that there indeed was one unsolved
problem in this area - how to compute the number of different magic
squares of a particular order. However, I still insist that I am not
aware of any magic sqare-related problem that is demonstrated to be
NP-complete.

Magic squares of *any* order, containing integers that differ by a
constant can be constructed trivially.

I know that it is possible, and recall that the smallest square of
this kind had a rather high order - 12 or something like that. I also
recall some tricky problem with using the prime number 2 in it -
because it spoils the evenness (si that the proper English term?) of
the rows/columns... Unfortunately, my copy of "Mathematical
Recreations" by Martin Gardner is on my bookshelf in Sofia, so it is
rather difficult to consult it right now... :-) Oh, well, I guess
sci.math is the more appropriate place for this.

P.S. Yes, recreational mathematics is one of my hobbies. Actually, I
owe to Martin Gardner's books that I've selected to make computer
programming my profession...

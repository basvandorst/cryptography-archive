Usual method is use a small public exponent (3, 17, etc). so
you don't have to do much multplication.  Then encryption is
pretty fast on most reasonable computers these days.  You can
speed up the multiplication with Karatsuba's method (see Knuth
vol. 2.).  Fancier multiplication methods exist, but don't appear
to be worthwhile for numbers of this size.

John!  Your of course entirely correct that a good encryptization scheme
is possible but.....

    jms don't do maths!  jms, wonderful writer and Great Maker that he
    is, is basically borderline illiterate when it comes to engineering
    and mathematics.

    I join the chorus!  JMS, don't do it!  Unless you know and know that
    you know that your code cannot be broken.  That means that you must
    use one of the methods described by Mr. Schilling.  Little password
    protected files will be broken within days!!!  No doubt about it.

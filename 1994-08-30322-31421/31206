Starting the calculation from scratch each time.  One does not test a 100+
digit number for primality by essentially running the Seive of Eratosthenes,
the universe isn't that old.  To put the numbers in perspective, estimates
as to the number of atoms in the universe run in the vicinity of 10**90.

It is still expensive to use large numbers of universes as a storage medium.

If you're still referring to primes, they published both of them.

The same principle is used in the GPS constellation and some kinds of
amateur packet modems to enhance the transmission reliability of small
amounts of data in the presence of a large amount of random noise.

The base transmits a short pseudorandom sequence of bits. The receiver
slides the same sequence along the uncorrelated background noise until
the receiver notices that in one particular position their are far
more matching "peaks" and "valleys" than in any other position. You
are now in sync and can then copy the bursts that follow relatively
easily.

Reputedly phones like the Tropez do not actually use spread-spectrum for
the voice portion of the transmission, though, so we're still going to
have to wait for Voice-PGP or something before we have true voice/data
radio security.

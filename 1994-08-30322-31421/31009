A friend of mine just sent me a copy of a suit against RSADSI.  It's
a long claim, but here's a few tidbits that should get some comments
going here.
===========================================================================
In the United States District Court for the Northern District of California 
 
Civil Action File No. C-94 20512 
	 
Assigned to Judge 
Category 410, Antitrust 
 
ROGER SCHLAFLY, an individual, Plaintiff 
v. 
PUBLIC KEY PARTNERS, 
and 
RSA DATA SECURITY INC., Defendants.  
 
 
Complaint Against Unfair Business Practices 
 
Plaintiff makes complaint against defendants for unfair business practices, 
including libel, interference with contractual relationships, patent 
misuse, fraud, monopolization, and racketeering, and demands remedies 
available under federal law, including jury trial, declaratory judgment, 
monetary damages, and injunctive relief. Jurisdiction. The Federal Court 
has jurisdiction because it is based on Federal law, including antitrust 
and patent law. Venue is proper because defendants and plaintiff reside in 
this Judicial District.  
 
For its complaint against defendants, plaintiff alleges as follows: 
 
1. This is an action for unfair business practices, libel, fraud, 
monopolization, and racketeering by Public Key Partners ("PKP"), which is 
managed by Mr. Robert Fougner, Director of Licensing, 310 North Mary 
Avenue, Sunnyvale, CA 94086 and by RSA Data Security Inc. ("RSADSI"), which 
does business at 100 Marine Parkway, Redwood City, CA 94065. 
[.....]

19. Defendants have fraudulently induced standards-making bodies, including 
American National Standards Institute ("ANSI") and Institute of Electrical 
and Electronics Engineers ("IEEE"), to draft standards based on the RSA and 
Diffie-Hellman patents by promising a reasonable and nondiscriminatory 
licensing policy, when in fact no such policy exists. ANSI and IEEE require 
such a policy, and would not have drafted RSA standards if PKP had not 
misrepresented its intentions. 
[......]

24. By getting their technology to be declared a draft standard, RSADSI has 
unfairly monopolized the cryptography market. Plaintiff has been damaged 
because competing technologies are regarded as nonstandard by the public. 
[......]

36. The idea of public key cryptography and digital signatures is disclosed 
in a paper titled "Multiuser cryptographic techniques" by Whitfield Diffie 
and Martin E Hellman, National Computer Conference, vol. 45, 1976. The 
paper was presented at a public conference in mid-June 1976, and published 
as part of the conference proceedings shortly thereafter. This was more 
than one year before any patents were filed, and therefore in the public 
domain according to 35 USC 102(b). A copy of the paper is attached as 
Exhibit T. 
[......]

42. The Hellman-Pohlig patent is not even a public key patent. PKP 
deceptively cites it to bolster their claim to own all public key technology. 
[......]

55. Defendants' conduct and tactics with regard to the PKP patents 
constitute patent misuse. 
 
56. Plaintiff is informed and believes and on that basis alleges that 
defendants charge different royalties to different licensees, and use price 
discrimination to bolster their monopoly. 
 
57. Defendants are in violation of antitrust laws with their monopolization 
tactics. 
 
58. Defendants have defamed plaintiff by making allegations of patent 
infringement to third parties, in violation of libel laws and laws against 
unfair business practices. 
 
59. Defendants concocted a joint scheme to fraudulently exaggerate the 
scope of their patents and deceive standards making bodies into drafting an 
RSA standard on or about April 6, 1990, the day the PKP partnership 
agreement in Exhibit A was consummated. Defendants formed an association -
in-fact that constituted an "enterprise" within the meaning of 18 USC 
1961(4). 
 
60. Defendants intended to use the exaggerated patents and phony license 
promises to monopolize the public key cryptography market, with full 
knowledge of the ANSI and IEEE patent policies-and of the invalidity of the 
Hellman-Merkle patent. 
[......]

66. Defendant PKP has conspired with defendant RSADSI to engage in a 
pattern of racketeering, in violation of the Racketeer Influenced and 
Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act. 
 
67. Plaintiff damages, in lost sales, contracts, and royalties, are 
estimated at $2 million. Much of this would have been interstate commerce, 
including royalties from ISC in Illinois. 
 
 
WHEREFORE, plaintiff prays for judgment as follows: 
 
1. That defendants, defendants' agents, partners, servants, employees, and 
all others acting in concert or participating with them, be enjoined during 
the pendency of this action and permanently from further interference with 
plaintiff's business. 
 
2. That defendants pay plaintiff $2 million in real and punitive damages, 
and that damages be trebled according to antitrust and RICO laws. 
 
3. That defendants be required to comply with the ANSI and IEEE patent 
policies. 
 
4. That defendants' patent claim on all public key technology be declared 
invalid. 
 
5. That practice of ElGamal encryption does not infringe any PKP patents, 
whether those patents are valid or not. 
 
6. That practice of the DSA does not infringe any PKP patents, whether 
those patents are valid or not. 
 
7. That the Diffie-Hellman patent be declared invalid and unenforceable.  
 
8. That the Hellman-Merkle patent be declared invalid and unenforceable. 
 
9. That defendants be estopped from enforcing the RSA patent. 
 
10. That defendants be enjoined from further libeling plaintiff. 
 
11. That defendants supply a complete list of persons and businesses that 
they have given false or libelous information, and that they send written 
retractions to each party. 
 
12. That defendant partnership PKP be dissolved, and its patent pool be 
divided and returned to each patent's rightful owner. 
 
13. That plaintiff be compensated for court costs and legal fees. 
 
14. That plaintiff have such other and further relief as is just and proper.

===============================================================================

It's going to be awhile before this actually goes to court, but it reminds me
of all the arguments I've seen here for the past couple of years.  It sounds
like AT&T lawyers are helping on this so there are some big bucks being played
out.  Should make Zimmerman and Grady's life a touch easier if the patents
are declared invalid.

e-mail me if you want a copy of the whole thing, it includes Cylinks complaint
as well (but none of the exhibits).

Patience, persistence, truth,
Dr. mike

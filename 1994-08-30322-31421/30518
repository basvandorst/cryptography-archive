However, systems which use an embedded computer program for transformation
or control are not. One more time--the RSA patent is not on a computer
program. It is on a complete cryptographic system. Read it instead of 
arguing, or consult a good patent attorney. 

The truth in this matter is counter-intuitive and no matter how smart you
think you are, you aren't going to prevail by argument, much less by making
up what's in the RSA patent out of whole cloth. It's a matter of specific
law and how it's phrased in general, and the language of the RSA patent
which makes it not a computer program or algorithm patent in particular. You
cannot succeed here using the method of proof by assertion.

Your argument is a very tired one. It was tried by the "wise guys" on the
U.S. side of the net a long time ago, and they were shot down by a patent
expert or two who knew the specific details of the patent, and finally by a
pointer to the patent itself.

You remind me of the sophomore (wise fool) who did the aerodynamic
demonstration proving that a bumble bee cannot fly. The bumble bee, being
unaware of this, goes flying merrily on, collecting honey.

taken to extremes the spurious notion of freedom without responsibility, and

are told by their pals that they are in the middle of the road. Nothing is
wrong any more (except, of course, conservative thoughts and expressions).

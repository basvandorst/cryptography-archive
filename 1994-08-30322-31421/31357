I'm not clear here as to whether you think PGP may have a systematic weakness
or that (RSA) public key encryption is weak. In the latter case, the body
of research in number theory, which is substantial, suggests that RSA
encryption is difficult to crack. By this I mean that an amount of computer
power many orders of magnitude in excess of that so far amassed would be
needed to factor a single 1024-bit key. If you think that this type of power
would be likely to be applied to your messages, then RSA is not secure.
Otherwise, in my humble opinion, it is.

If you consider that an unintended loophole is present in PGP, consider that:
1: The code is open. Many people have examined and worked on it. Any areas
of weakness get extensive discussion. (e.g random number threads...)

2: The PGP program is fundamentally quite simple, unlike "secure" operating systems which perform a far more elaborate task. It is thus far less likely
that a loophole exists. Consider that most UNIX weaknesses have involved bugs
in programs that need privilege to run, e.g. sendmail.

Of course, PGP is only secure when operated securely. There are systematic
attacks widely known that are probably much easier to an opponent than
factoring 1024-bit RSA.

This has been extensively discussed elsewhere. I think you should worry
about aspects of security other than a succesful RSA factoring. If you
want to know whether it's worth the CPU time to use bigger than 384-bit keys,
then I would say that it's pretty unlikely your parents, school, boss or
irate girlfriend can crack a 384 bit key. The NSA probably could, but,
given the likely expense, only if they suspected you of nuclear terrorism or similar.

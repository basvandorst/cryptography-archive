I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask, but is there any 
utility/method to crack os/2's lock-up password?  I sure hope there is one 
(or am I the only one with bad memory?), cause otherwise I'll be bound 
not to leave my desk for more than few minutes for the rest of my life 
(or until I reinstall os/2, whichever comes first)...

Thanks in advance,

From the work of Ueli Maurer, it seems that generation of integers which are
provably prime is not necessarily slower than generating probable primes.
Maurer has a paper entitled "Fast Generation of Prime Numbers and Secure
Public-Key Cryptographic Parameters", which is to appear in the J. of
Cryptology, describing an algorithm for randomly generating provably prime
integers which are almost uniformly distributed over a given interval.
(It's an improvement over a previous paper of his which appeared in EURO-
CRYPT '89.)  He gives arguments to show that generating a provably prime
number using his algorithm takes only about 1.57 times as long as the
Miller-Rabin test (which only generates probable primes) for a *single*
base.  (And if one is willing to sacrifice some uniformity, this factor can
be reduced to 1.05 or less.)  Since in order to achieve a high probability
the M-R test is normally run many times with different bases, Maurer's
algorithm is actually much faster.

Factoring is known to be in NP.  Thus, whether or not factoring
is NP-hard, if factoring is outside P, then there is a problem
that is in NP but outside P, and therefore P != NP.

Last I heard, factoring was not known to be NP-hard.  Some
mathemticians believe it is in P, others don't.

Factoring is known to be in QBP, the class of problems solvable in
probabilistic polynomial time on a quantum computer.  Unfortunately,
nobody knows how to build a quantum computer.  But then, nobody knows
how to build a gigabit 1-nanosecond DRAM either, and a crypto
algorithm whose security depended on this fact would not be considered
secure by most theorists.

Does anyone know enough about the technical specifics of the FBI Wiretap
sections of the Digital Telephony bill to tell me whether or not they would
allow someone to perform a man-in-the-middle attack against a Clipper-
encoded conversation? Specifically, would an agent be able to add a device to
the phone switch that would enable him/her to route both ends of a conversation
through a 'black box' without the detection?
 
Thanks,
Josh

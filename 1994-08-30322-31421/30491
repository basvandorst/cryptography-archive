    August:        Cracking RSA-129

    Date:          Wednesday, Aug 10
    Time:          7:00pm
    Location:      MIT
                   Building E51 Room 329  (larger room)
                   70 Memorial Drive
                   Cambridge, MA

    Coordinator:   Kim Carney, <kim@mit.edu>
    Speaker:       Derek Atkins, <warlord@mit.edu>

    Description:   Seventeen years ago, the phrase "The magic words 
    are squeamish ossifrage" was encrypted using a 129-digit key. At 
    that time, it was thought that decrypting this phrase would take 
    40 quadrillion years.  Recently, a team of people from various 
    educational and research organizations around the Internet broke the 
    code. Derek Atkins, a member of the team, will join us to discuss 
    the work involved in discovering the previously unknown phrase.

    This meeting will be jointly held with the BCS Internet SIG.

    BackBay Large Installation System Administration forum (BBLISA) was 
    founded in July 1992 to provide a forum for meetings and presentations 
    of interest to system and network administrators in Boston, MA, and 
    the surrounding areas.  BackBayLISA caters to administrators of large and 
    small networks, alike.

    Membership in the group is free; everything is done on a voluntary
    basis.

    The group holds monthly meetings, currently at MIT in Cambridge.  
    Meetings are held on the second Wednesday of each month. The
    directions can be ftp'd from ftp.bblisa.org:/pub/bblisa/directions

    Gatherings normally start at 6:30pm with an opportunity to meet
    other folk and chat.  The meeting starts at 7:00pm and consists 
    of announcements, discussion of future activities, job announcements, 
    followed by the presentation from the guest speaker.  The meeting 
    usually goes on until 9:00-9:30, at which point folk often adjourn to 
    the Cambridge Brewing Company.

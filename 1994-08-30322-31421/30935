   Hmmm.  With only 4 digits to spoof, a man in the middle would only have
to try 10,000 different temp keys to get a match.  I'd guess the designers
of the system figured that it would take too long to brute force search
for a session key / public key pair that hit the right number.  It wouldn't
be a good idea to leave the possibility of precomputed fingerprints....

I've not been able to find a decent reference to this.

Could someone please explain to me what a book cipher is, how it's 
implemented, protected and, ultimately, broken.  Perhaps even 
pointers to book ciphers which are known (broken or unbroken... I've
heard of a Beale cipher).

Thanks... (please respond via email)

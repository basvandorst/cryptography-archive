I am working on a project that includes an implementation and an
evaluation paper about IDEA. I would like to include in my paper comments
and opinions about IDEA from people involved in cryptography and
cryptanalysis. Of course, all selected comments will be included with
proper accreditation. My paper will be submitted next week for evaluation
and review. We are seeking publication through the ACM and SIAM.

Those of you guys who would like to cooperate with us, please e-mail your
comments to PB4@aol.com ***TONIGHT IF POSSIBLE*** because we're running
out of time. Consider answering these questions:

Is IDEA a good or a bad cipher?
Is it good enough to substitute DES?
Is it better than DES or not?.

Please include your name, qualifications and the name of your institution
or company. We are asking for free contributions (this is not a commercial
and there is no money involved), since the paper is for academic purposes.

Thanks in advance for your help.

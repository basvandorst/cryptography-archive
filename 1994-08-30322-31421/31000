Is there a way to authenticate a message as being "reasonably close" to
the original message?  I know this sounds like a contradiction, but the
application I am thinking of is in the transmission/reproduction of
images, where the transmission process alters the image slightly.

A simple-minded approach (that doesn't work) is to authenticate only
the upper N out of M bits, where the image is represented by M bits per
pixel.  The reason it doesn't work is that even the upper-most bit can
be altered by a slight perturbation (e.g. 127 -> 128 on an 8 bit/pixel
image).

Perhaps what would be useful in general is an authentification method
that would say that the difference between a message and its original
is at most X.  Where X is a meaningful metric for some class of
messages.  Does such a method exist?

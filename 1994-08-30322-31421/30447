      I second this most strongly, it is an excellent book.  However...
     The thing people always leave out when asking this question is what
     sort of technical background they have.  Just because one has access to
     sci.crypt, one does not necessarily have a reasonable background in the
     appropriate mathematics, Unix, C programming, or a real operating system.
     If you aren't mathematically inclined, but interested in the sort of crypto.
     covered by "Codebreakers" then you might want to find "Elements of 
     Cryptanalysis" by William Friedman (published by Aegean Park Press).
     At approx. $40.00 it costs about 5x as much as the more easily available 
     "Cryptanalysis" by Gaines (Dover) but is about 10x better as a self-teaching 
     tool.  If you have a strong mathematical background, then you might want to 
     look up the titles suggested by Mark Riordan in his occasional posting.  Even
     if you don't have the mathematics, but you are willing to apply yourself,
     you can get quite a lot out of some of the titles he recommends.   Marks
     primary recommendation is "Codes and Cryptography" by Dominic
     Walsh (Oxford UP).

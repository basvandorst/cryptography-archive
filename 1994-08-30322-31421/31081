It seems a lot of problems inherent in building poisson or
gaussian noise devices might be obviated by building two
such devices on the same board and then only using the 
uncorrelated products of the individual devices for
input to the distillation step. Sort of like how gravity
wave detectors try to eliminate local bias.

I suppose you could also expand on this principle to
create a high quality random noise device from a large
quantity of low quality devices that had the property of
being able to be mass produced, several hundred or
thousand on a die.

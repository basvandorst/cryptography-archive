i don't know much about pgp but i ask myself, whether there isn't allready
some kind of precedence.
european governments have agreed an the gms-standard in the field of mobil
phones. i heard from somebody, who should know it, that this is absolutely
secure, as long as it is a call from one mobil phone to another. another
person, who could know it also, was sceptical, but i don't know, whether
his scepticism was more a philosophical one. anyway, it seems unbelievable,
that gms is indeed secure, but it is possible, that european governments
did indeed agree on that.
the situation with mobil phone in the states is a different one. their doesn't
exist, as i was told by someboody else, any national standard. this could
be the reason, why gms was not discussed in eff.news... or do i overweight
gms? BTW how is china?????????>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

	This is one of the first problems I realised when I concidered 
duress codes. I developed a simple soultion. In addition to duress 
infomation, and the real infomation, I add random data. Because the 
random data is added in a unknown amount, someone who discovered 
unaccounted space would obtain no usefull infomation, it could either be 
ciphertext, or the random data used to foil this attack. I would have 
posted my ideas when the subject first came up, but my system was unable 
to post (we have various hardware/overload problems at this site).

I hadn't realized they were all that secret.  I've had to write routines
for about thirty different "checkdigit" algorithms for all sorts of
id numbers.  I'll admit some of them are pretty weird, selecting among
different scrambled tables and so forth.  But in almost every case the
agency just gave me a photocopy of the state's algorithm.  I've never
signed anything, or saw any notices that the information was confidential
or secret.  Maybe its because I was writing software for other state
agencies, they considered it "all in the family."  Normally, the government
goes a little crazy and stamps everything "confidential," even for insiders.
On the other hand I have run into government agencies that really didn't
have anyone on staff who knew how the system worked.  The system generating
the numbers was written twenty years ago, and nobody now at the agency knew
the algorithm.

I know it may not be as challenging for mathamaticians, but did anyone
try asking the state agency for a copy of their algorithm?

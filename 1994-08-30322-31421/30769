    First of all, discovery laws are very different in civil and
criminal cases, and you don't make this distiction above.  I can see
someone being ordered in a civil case to turn over all keys needed,
but not in a criminal case.

    If a judge grants immunity with respect to the key, I can't
imagine any evidence trail which originated in that key being allowed
in court.  (Or at least I would expect some appellate court to grant a
new trial.)

    (Of course, I am not a lawyer, and if I was, I would tell you that
this advice may not be applicable in all cases, etc.)

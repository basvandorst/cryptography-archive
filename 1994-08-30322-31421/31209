yup - but if the USA does not wake up to the fact the European community
and other parts of the world resent these attempts to play "big brother" some US countries
may find that the EEC will place limits on certain US companies trading
in Europe. For everyone's sake I hope that this nonsense will stop soon.
This sort of behaviour was at one time justified as part of the cold war
strategy. Now that is over  could it not be seen as a form of economic
imperialism? ;-)


Certainly PGP 2.6 is in widely available here and any attempts by US gov
to play the bully boy here will probably only result in another loss of face
for the US administration. Sort of Boston tea party in reverse!?!! :-)  


We have no need to use PGP ourselves. If its important enough to use
something like PGP to provide security then it is important enough for
someone to crack it. I for one do not believe PGP is as secure as its
made out to be. I cannot prove that so do not ask me to do so -
but I would not rely on anything other than totally private key encryption
with all the limitations that that imposes. I have seen too many
so called "secure systems" broken with far greater ease than their creators
and users ever imagined possible to place any real confidence in
any of them no matter what the current scientific consensus indicates. In
crtpography there is always "someone somewhere" who is secretively ahead
of the pack by a fair distance.



Leaving that hoary old chestnut to one side can anyone come up with any
meaningful response to the question:
 
"How safe is RSA"

which has been posed in another thread?

[ Using Diffie-Hellman as public key, with published a, n, a**x mod n ]

]normally think of DH as being only for key exchange.

There are two problems - one is a convenience issue (there are several
steps to the communications, which is fine for session-oriented
activities like telnet, but not very useful for store-and-forward email,
though it could be used for link-encryption on SMTP connections.)

The other problem is whether you can use the same half-key multiple times;
somebody's probably done papers about this, but I'd worry about
whether it was usable, especially since someone can send you any
choice of a**y mod n and get you to raise it to your private power x.
I know discrete logarithms are hard, but I'd still be a bit worried if
handed "a**y = 2", and not real happy about being handed 0 or 1 either.
(After all, they don't really have to find y such that a**y = 2, 
they can just hand you a 2...)

On the other hand, if you are going to change your Diffie-Hellman
half-key each time, there's the man-in-the-middle problem to solve,
and digital signatures on your key-parts are a good approach for that -
but then you need to distribute the digital signature information anyway.

I suspect the real issue, though, is that somebody has to implement
and distribute it, and RSA was well-known before any widespread
Diffie-Hellman code came out, solves more problems, and was what Phil Z. 
used for PGP so it's what we all use.....

	A few years back, I rember hearing alot of talk about CA's 
(Cellular Automations<sp?>) usefulness to cryptography. I have a simple 
question, are they still concidered secure, or has someone found a way to 
crack them? I am thinking of the one that used several cells in a line 
that have OR statements and addition (I think).

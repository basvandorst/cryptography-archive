I have found the following info on the density of prime numbers.

The function that gives the number of primes less than or equal to
a number, N, is called pi(N).

There is an unproven conjecture in analysis called the Riemann
hypothesis, which states that the zeros of a function called
the Riemann zeta function are restricted to a certain region.
No counterexamples have yet been found.  The concensus (for
what it's worth) among mathematicians is that R.H. is very
likely to be true (my info is on this is dated 1952.  Perhaps
there has been progress on this problem since then).  If the
conjecture is true, it implies that pi(N) is approximated by


  integral from 0 to N of dx/ln(x)


This is called the log integral, or li function.  The implication
is further that:

     li(N) - pi(N) is always positive and on the order of

     sqrt(N) * ln(N)

Making li(n) and pi(N) assymtotic to each other (that is their
ratio tends toward unity).

So, if R.H. is true, the number of primes < 1e100, for example, is
about 4.36e97, with an error of only about 2.3e52 (not much out
of that many).

The info given by the poster above for 1e200 sounds to be in the
right ballpark (my floating point overflowed when I tried to take
li of 1e200).

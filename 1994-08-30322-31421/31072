in the mail this last week.  (This was the "fast software encryption" con-
ference where Bruce Schneier presented his paper on Blowfish.)  This is a
*really* neat book!  My only wish is that it came with C source for all the
algorithms.
 
   Does anyone know if any of those ciphers has been broken yet, or if there
have been any really interesting results on any of them?  There were ciphers
that were clearly designed for immediate use (SAFER-64, Blowfish, SEAL), and
other ciphers that were apparently designed to test the theoretical waters
(Anderson's rotor machine/lfsr combination, and Kaliski & Robshaw's proposal
for an MD5-like cipher based on a *really* large block.)
 
   For reference:  The book is #809 in Springer-Verlag's Lecture Notes in
Computer Science series, _Fast Software Encryption_, Ross Anderson, Ed.
This has two ISBN numbers on it:
   3-540-58108-1
   0-387-58108-1

I think that`s a good idea, anyone who wants to can d-load the
program and take the stat's of the type of files they want...
Then post the results here and possibly archive them at some ftp site.

I saw that someone posted the source code for a program that would do
freq. counting...has anybody run it yet to see how well it works...for
instance, can you designate a stat file and have it update those stats
as you process multiple messages???  Again, if there is a desire for
such a program (and there is'nt already a good one out there) I'll write
it and post it here when I'm done.  Let me know what you think.

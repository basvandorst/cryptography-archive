Somebody told me, that the D-net in Germany uses RSA to authorize and then
an 8-bit XOR-key to encrypt the sound data. Also you should be able to
receive the sended data within 1.5-3 km from the phone, so a receiver
at the bottom of a car or someone following then car (if he does not
drive at 250 km/h...) could get it.
Anybody out there who knows more about this?

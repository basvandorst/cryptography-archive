Unfortunately, flaming someone has considerably more effect on the
reputation of the flamer than that of the  flamee. It is much better,
not to mention quicker, to place the object of your irritation into
your kill file, where they won't bother you again. Otherwise you
generally end up like Canute, who you'd have to admit looked a little
silly even if he was a king.

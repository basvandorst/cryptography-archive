   This is clearly necessary.  However, I don't think it's sufficient,
unless the random data makes up the vast majority of the data on the
disk.  Now, let me make sure I'm being clear with the weakness I see
in this--it's not that it's possible to be sure that X% of space free
implies that there's another level.  Instead, it's that the probability
of there being at least one more level available is a function of the
percentage of free disk space.  This doesn't mean that Bruno knows when
to stop breaking bones, but he may be able to get a clue from the amount
of disk space accounted for.  If he's recently tried this disk-encryptor
1000 different times with different seed data, and he's seen that when
more than 40% of the disk is unaccounted for, 70% of the time, there's
another level available, then he's going to listen to your claims that
the other 55% of your disk space is random bits with a touch of
skepticism.
 
   The obvious solution to this is to have the vast majority of
the disk be random bits.  This way, the amount of variation in
your random levels will be small regardless of how many levels
are available.  Note that simply requiring that the last level
not take up much space won't work--it'll just make your attacker
look for the next-to-last level.  Only if all level sizes are
relatively tiny will this attack not work to some extent.

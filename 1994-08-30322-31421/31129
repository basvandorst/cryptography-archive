Summary: WPcrak Needs Testing
Keywords: Wordperfect Password Recovery

I have written a program WPcrak which finds Wordperfect passwords for 
Wordperfect thru version 5.2.

This program implements a known plaintext attack against a well known 
weakness of the Wordperfect encryption algorithm.  The program uses a 
"reference file" which contains the same base font and printer setup as 
the encrypted file (usually this is available to a legitimate user) to 
determine the file password.

Of the thousands of copies in use, I have only had one validated 
complaint that the program would not automatically extract the exact 
password.  In this case the password was extracted by manually viewing 
the program output screen. One other case is pending ( I have not yet 
seen the files). 

I am wondering if there are any closet cryptographers out there who would 
be interested in helping me test the program and establish some data 
concerning reliability. I could possibly offer incentives.

CHARTER

The discussion of cryptography, cryptanalysis, and related issues, in
a more civilised environment than is currently provided by sci.crypt.

There are 5 moderators:
 
  David Wagner <dawagner@princeton.edu>
  Greg Rose <greg_rose@sydney.sterling.com>
  Mark Lomas <tmal@cl.cam.ac.uk>
  Michael Paul Johnson <mpj@netcom.com>
  Peter Gutmann <pgut01@cs.aukuni.ac.nz>

The submission address has not yet been determined.


RATIONALE: 
 
This vote is an attempt to provide for the creation of a forum with a
lower volume and higher quality of information than what is currently
available in sci.crypt.  It is hoped that the creation of a moderated
group will encourage more active debate on cryptographic research and
related issues than currently takes place in sci.crypt.


HOW TO VOTE

Send MAIL to:   vote@dogwood.com
Just Replying should work if you are not reading this on a mailing
list.

The subject in your mail message must contain the name of the group to
allow your vote to be correctly handled by an automated vote-counter,
if you do not do this you will receive a message asking you to
resubmit your vote with the name of the group that you are voting for
in the subject line.

Please do not quote the entire CFV in your vote, it will confuse the
automatic vote counter and will earn you a duplicate vote message.

Your mail message should contain one of the following statements:
      I vote YES on sci.crypt.research
      I vote NO on sci.crypt.research

You may also ABSTAIN in place of YES/NO - this will not affect the
outcome.  Anything else may be rejected by the automatic vote counting
program.  The votetaker will respond to your received ballots with a
personal acknowledgement by mail - if you do not receive one within
several days, try again.  It's your responsibility to make sure your
vote is registered correctly.

Only one vote per person, no more than one vote per account.  No votes
will be accepted from system accounts (i.e. root, news, uucp) or
anonymous accounts.  Addresses and votes of all voters will be
published in the final voting results list.

I have uploaded to the SimTel Software Repository (available by anonymous
ftp from the primary mirror site OAK.Oakland.Edu and its mirrors):

SimTel/msdos/fileutil/
cs-251.zip      CHK-SAFE checks file integrity w/MD5 algorithm

Chk-Safe v2.51 is a program written by Bill Lambdin, Don Peters and
Robert Bullock which uses the MD5 hash algorithm from RSA Data Security,
Inc. to validate the integrity of software.  It's purpose is similar to
that of VALIDATE which is distributed by McAfee Associates, but it uses
a stronger hash function and thus provides much greater security.  Hash
codes for antivirus software will be published in forums such as
comp.virus/VIRUS-L so that users can check the validity of their
software.

Version 2.51 is the first version which is being offered via anonymous
ftp.  Previous versions were much slower, but due to optimizations the
current version is more than twice as fast.  Bill Lambdin has given his
permission for me to upload this program, and for its redistribution.

Special Requirements: None

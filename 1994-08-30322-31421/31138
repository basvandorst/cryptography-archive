I posted the following article about 2 years ago as part of an ongoing 
thread on truly random number generation.  After a bit of digging I finally 
managed to unearth it again from my sci.crypt archives, so here it is along 
with comments by others.  I should add that I used MD5 (now SHS) to mix the 
data coming from this generator (ie I read 1024 bits, ran MDC/MD5 over it 
to "distribute the randomness", XOR'd in another 1024 bits, ran MDC/MD5 over 
it, and so on - for more details see the PGP or SFS docs), which I didn't 
mention in the original article.
 
For those interested in RNG's, there was an ongoing discussion in mid-late 
1992 about this topic.  The following four articles are just a part of this.

The following is a simple hardware noise generator which you can throw together
using junk box parts in about 10 minutes.  It's based on thermal noise in a
zener diode, and is powered by its own supply to reduce the chance of noise
from the computers supply being coupled in.
 
There are three stages to the circuit:
 
1. The noise generator, a reverse-biased zener.  The random motion of
   electrons inside it causes random fluctuations in the voltage across it.
   I had a BZX85 9V1 zener so I used that (or at least that's what I assume it
   is - the lettering's worn off).  You could probably use a special noise
   diode if you can find one.  A quick flip through about 2 feet of suppliers
   catalogues hasn't turned up anything, and even then they're probably just
   std. diodes which have passed some sort of noise certifying test.
 
2. An amplifier for the diode noise.  The output from the zener is fairly low-
   level, so I fed it through an op-amp.  The diode noise is fed in through a
   0.1uF capacitor to the 741, which is set up as a differential amplifier, ie
   one which amplifies the difference in the signals at its two inputs.
 
3. A pulse shaper to get a nice square wave from the noise output of the 741,
   fed in via another 0.1uF capacitor.  You can use anything here, a schmitt
   trigger or some sort of buffer - I ripped a 4049 out of a logic probe.
   You can just use anything that can be wired up to buffer/clean up a signal.
 
Here's the circuit diagram ("schematic" to US people):

-9V
 
The component values are very noncritical - I had a batch of 10k resistors left
over from an R-2R D/A converter (not that you can tell from looking at the
circuit :-), as well as a generic boxfull of 0.1uF decoupling capacitors.  The
op-amp used was a 741, the buffer was two gates from a 4049 but you could wire
in just about anything.
 
If you were feeling really paranoid about noise from the computer PSU getting
into the circuit, you could feed the final signal through an optocoupler.  I
just clipped it at 5V and fed it into the printer port "Ready" input.  You
could probably get away with the 9V driving one of the serial port handshaking
signals if you don't have a printer port.
 
Ideally the generator should be powered by two 9V batteries.  I never have any
that aren't flat so I used a conventional mains power supply.
 
The only thing which needs adjusting is the duty cycle, which can be changed by
varying the 10k pot.  If you've got one, you can hook an oscilloscope to the
output of the op-amp and check for a 50/50 duty cycle.  However a much more
precise measurement can be made by hooking the thing to your computer and
timing the duty cycle.  The control afforded by the pot is a bit rough, it may
be better to substitute a multiturn one for better control.  However the final
product will still drift a bit with temperature.  It's probably easier to
compensate in software for any bias or drift in the signal.  Alternatively you
could take advantage of the fact that buffers come six to a chip (4050) and use
an LM348 (quad 741) to get 4 bits at a time, with one bit in each pair set up
to cancel the bias on the second bit.  If you were feeling really ambitious you
could get an octal buffer and two 348's and generate a byte at a time.
 
As to the performance of the circuit, for it's simplicity it performs amazingly
well.  It may not use a NIST-certified noise generator, but it is a reasonably
good random noise generator, provided it's driven off it's own power supply,
has compensation for bias in the duty cycle, and possibly an optocoupler in the
output.
 
If anyone has any comments or improvements I'd be interested in hearing from
them.  I'm also interested in any construction hints people have, or comments
on important details I've neglected to mention, or alternative components which
can be used - I've assumed some knowledge of electronics for this, I wasn't
quite sure what level to pitch it at.  Finally, if anyone builds one of the
more ambitious setups (4 or 8 bits at a time) I'd be interested in what sort of
results they give.
 
Peter.

Fundamentally, I think this idea works.  I have built a zener-diode
noise source similar to this, that I then xor'ed into a hardware
feedback-shift-register PRN generator.  The noise coming out of this
appears to be quite random.
 
Some ideas for you:
 
1. I don't understand the need for the 10K pot.  Isn't your noise
   source AC-coupled into the op-amp?  Seems like adjusting the pot
   shouldn't have much effect.  My noise source had no pot.
 
2. You are relying on the noise from the zener diode, which we assume
   to be completely unpredictable.  However, people have spent years
   figuring out how to make zener diodes with low noise levels.  So,
   your noise signal may be small.  You want to ensure that other
   signals don't get coupled in and swamp out your good random noise
   with other junk.  (If your op-amp input voltage noise is very big,
   it could swamp out the zener noise, but that's probably not bad.)
 
   One thing I did was take the output of the op-amp, and run it
   through two different R-C first-order low-pass filters.  These two
   signals went into a comparator, effectively making a bandpass
   filter and at the same time giving me a TTL signal output.  On the
   low frequency end, I wanted to avoid picking up 60 Hz stuff.  On
   the high end, I wanted to ensure that no high-frequency system
   clocks got in.
 
   I'm not sure that how much high-frequency stuff needs to be
   filtered out.  One problem with filtering it, is that it limits how
   fast you can grab random bits out of the noise source.  With no
   high-freqeuncy filter, you are effectively using the bandwidth of
   the op-amp as your high-frequency cutoff.
 
3. As I recall, 6.2V is the magic zener voltage level which has the
   lowest noise, so you want to design your circuit with a zener that
   is either much bigger or much smaller than this value.  My noise
   source used a 10V zener.  You probably want the cheapest zener
   diode you can find.
 
4. Although the noise from a zener is supposed to be completely
   unpredictable, it does not have a flat frequency spectrum or very
   many other properties that are desired for random numbers.
   Therefore, you must use this noise source along with some other
   noise source.  My design used a hardware feedback shift register,
   but there is no reason you couldn't use a good software random
   number generator.

You have to be a bit careful here. The bitstream from the feedback shift
register will look random even if there is not a lot of noise coming out
of the zener, or if the entropy of the noise source is being killed by a
circuit resonance somewhere.
 
The Intel KEYPROM used a similar idea for an on-chip noise generator
which was used to generate random challenges. Instead of a zener, they
used the relative drift of three oscillators as the random source.
 
Earlier this year, we took a look at their test results and estimated
that this random source only contributed about one bit of noise per
fifty bits of output. The other forty-nine were just the shift register
sequence.
 
If you do use a shift register to condition the output of a generator, it
would seem prudent to do a linear equivalence test on the output - that is,
check that the linear complexity of n bits of output is about n/2.
 
There's no inherent reason why a zener-plus-shift-register design should
be bad, but there are a lot of things that can go subtly wrong with the
implementation, so testing is vital,

Agreed.  The analog noise source must first be verified before hooking
it to the digital noise source.  One thing to verify is that the
high-frequency cutoff (whether due to an explicit filter or due to
bandwidth limit of your op-amp) is much higher than the frequency at
which you will sample the noise source.  Another thing to verify is
that the frequency spectrum of the noise output doesn't contain any
suspicious peaks, especially at frequencies related to the frequency
at which you will sample the noise source.

This is true enough. Lets see what the charter of _this_ discission group says about what is
to be discussed in it:

"A common myth is that sci.crypt is USENET's catch-all crypto newsgroup.
It is not. It is reserved for discussion of the _science_ of cryptology,
including cryptography, cryptanalysis, and related topics such as 
one-way hash functions."

This means that discussion of "cryptography, cryptanalysis, and related topics"
possible _could_ occurr on the same level as a cryptologic journal _without_
violating the charter.

This remark really irks me. As far as I can judge, Silverman (and some others)
_do indeed_ explain themselves in intelligent layman's terms. In any case, an
explanation in laymans terms should not be required for a specialist discussion
group as this.

This is obvious. But again, I quote the charter of this discussion group:
"It is reserved for discussion of the _science_ of cryptology,
including cryptography, cryptanalysis, and related topics such as 
one-way hash functions."

Please note the word "_science_". In order to be able to discuss this "_science_",
certain prerequisites are required of the participant. A participant who does not
have these prerequisites is _not_ entitled to verbal or written warfare against
those who _do_ have these prerequisites, and who _do_ discuss this "_science_".

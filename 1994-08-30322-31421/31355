The conjecture is that the zeros have real part=1/2 (the "region" is a 
line)... the approximation does NOT depend on the Riemann Conjecture (the 
approxomation is asymptotic and works)

I believe it has been proven that li(N)-pi(N) changes sign infinitely 
often (but the size of the numbers for the first sign change is obscenely 
large... not sure of that, but I believe it was a comment thrown out by a 
teacher when I was taking number theory about 7 years ago) (this would 
make the error small where it changes sign)

(where they change sign, pi(N) changes by at most one, and the change in 
li(x) as x varies by one is around 1/x... so If my memory about the 
change in sign is correct, the error estimate is wrong)

(maybe you meant the error as an upper bound? I do not know what it is, 
yours looks good... but only a bound)

Again... this does not depend on the R.H.

Excuse me, but this is sci.crypt.  Command line options for PGP?  I've 
never seen any here.  Maybe you think you're still in alt.security.pgp?  
Please show me a solid example if I'm wrong.  Politics --- was a problem 
here but people here are making efforts to reduce that and let me say they 
are at least partially successful.

If theoretical security of a given cipher is not a valid topic in 
sci.crypt, please list me valid topics, and please compare your list with 
the sci.crypt charter, and please post a report of the comparison.

I have to admit that your idea of building a newbie-bot is neat.

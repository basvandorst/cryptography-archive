No, it is not. However, it should be a requirment that those partaking
in discussion have done their basic, preliminary homework and have
at least read the rudiments of the subject. Many posts here seem to
indicate (based on content) that the poster has not done his/her
preliminary homework. There is an expression: RTFM. I think it
applies.

This is not a classroom in introductory cryptography or in algorithms.
It should be assumed (IMO) that the "intelligent layman" can at least
understand the basic terminology of the field and be able to pose 
well-formulated questions. If not, then (IMO) they should first go 
read an introduction to the subject. If this is arrogant, then so be it.

Indeed, I think it arrogant on the part of others that they believe I
should have to discuss everything in terms that newbies can understand.
When you (for example) go to a golf pro, you pay him for lessons. I
am not being paid to give low-level tutorials.  I give what (little)
time I can in answering questions.

When you take a course from a professor in college, it is certainly
reasonable to expect that you have learned the prerequisites and not
waste his time if you have not. Indeed, the erosion of this standard
(requiring prerequisites) is ruining secondary education today.
The only question should be: What are the prerequisites for this
group? IMO, people should at least have skimmed a basic book on the
subject and understand the terminology. They also need to understand
the rudiments of time-complexity in algorithms. It is obvious that
many people who post here have not done so.

I make no apology for my belief in demanding *excellence*. IMO,
if schools demanded more of it we would be a lot better off.

>sci.crypt is not research.crypto.advanced.
 
Nor is it "sci.crypt.1st.semester.course"
There are times when a professor's answer to a question MUST be:
That is part of the prerequisites. If you don't know, then get a book
from the library and read it.

IMO, it is quite reasonable for a professor to tell a student, when
a question is asked: "The question is meaningless; go think about it
and come back when you are ready to pose it in a meaningful way".
Agsin, IMO, this sort of interaction is a part of the learning process.

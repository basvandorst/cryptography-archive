Or say, a CD-ROM?  That looks like a great 'book' in this case.  Simply
right a driver that will allow you to scan the entire CD-ROM in what
most UNIX types would call raw mode.  Then you could do a simple, non
repeating (for short messages at least) character cipher system.

Ie. if your message had a 'A', scan the CD for a 'A' and encode it as
the offset from the start of the CD as the encoded version.

Given the prevalance of CD-ROM players these days, it shouldn't be too
hard to set this up...in fact you could even get a CD-ROM of books (old
books, but eh?) and use a '<book><offset>' sort of tupple.

Sound reasonable?

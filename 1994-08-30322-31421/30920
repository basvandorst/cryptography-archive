Assuming that the vote passes (fingers crossed), we need a volunteer for a site
to handle submissions before they're sent to moderators.  What this would
involve is the creation of an address crypt-request@<sitename> which would
forward all mail sent to it to the moderators, preferably without adding dozens
of lines of headers.  This shouldn't be too hard using <insert favourite
scripting language here, eg perl>, all you need to do is mail submissions out
to the moderators in a round-robin fashion.
 
Having the submission address here isn't really possible because (1) the mail
system we use is weird, and (2) having all of sci.crypt.research flowing
through our overseas link three times per article is probably unhealthy.
 
The prerequisites for the submission site are:
 
  - It should be outside the US.
  - It should have a reliable internet connection(s).
  - It should be a site which will be around for a long time to come.
  - It should come pre-installed with someone capable of setting up the
    remailing system.
 
Any volunteers?
 
Peter.

I am working on implementing an electronic voting package that includes
several voting protocols with varying privacy/security/complexity
trade offs.  I am not a cryptography expert, and I had hoped to be able 
to plug in an encryption package such as PGP for all the necessary 
encryption and digital signatures.  However, for one of the 
protocols I would like to include, I need to be able to do blind 
signatures.  Does anyone know of a public domain (or free for 
non-commercial use) implementation of blind signatures?  
Or is there a way to use PGP to do blind
signatures.  I read Schneier's description as well as Chaum's
paper, but I am still a bit confused about how to actually
implement a blind signature protocol.

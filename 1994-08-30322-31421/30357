Has the offense with which he's charged (or for which the grand jury
is considering a charge) been made public ?

He can imagine it because it's happening.  We post crypto
code/algorithms/systems to sci.crypt all the time.  Whether this is
export and if so whether it's illegal export is debatable at best, but
it's been going strong for years.

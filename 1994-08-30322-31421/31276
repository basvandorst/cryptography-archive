A couple points:

#1 It looks like you've never read ANYTHING about RSA. Raising a number to
a power modulo a number is *NOT* an easily reversable procedure. Just
because f(5) = 6, doesn't mean it's easy to make f^-1 such that f^-1(6) = 5.

#2 Even if you WERE right about it being easy, given enough 
plaintext/cyphertext(SP), that STILL wouldn't apply to PGP, because PGP 
*ONLY ENCRYPTS ABOUT 128 BITS* with the RSA KEY.

Given the above two points, I think you should seriously consider reading
about RSA and PGP.

: Reply via e-mail; I don't have time to read news that often.

I'll email and post this, and I recommend you expect people to reply to you
in posts, because it's *nice* to let other people read responses.

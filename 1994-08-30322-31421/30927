But the keyspace may be a whole lot smaller than that. JMS has said that 
the clues will be something like the name of a ship that appears in 
such-and-such an episode.  We can infer that the keys would therefore be 
English or English-like words. For example, "Giznambulon" might be 
possible, but "k23479sKJHiuh*Kjkh9080" would not.  This would further be 
limited to words that the user would be able to remember and spell from 
memory (I think).

This would cut the possibilities waaaay down. I leave it to other who 
might know the math involved (I don't) to answer whether it makes the 
answers perilously guessable.

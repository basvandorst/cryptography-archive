Indeed.  I remember some similar experiments with optical signals, where 
there was some rather intense 60 Hz and 120 Hz "noise" that kind of 
drowned out other effects if you didn't filter it out.

I tend to think that radioactive decay and/or cosmic radiation tends to
provide a better source for physical noise that can't be reproduced, even
partially, elsewhere.  Unfortunately, geiger counters or scintillation
counters cost a little more than a resistor and an op amp or quad CMOS
inverter driven by a zener diode.  The output still has to be
post-processed, even with a radiation detector.  The bit rate of cosmic
rays tends to be rather slow, unless you have a detector with a very large
capture area. Even a small sample of radioactive material at close range
(perhaps inside the detector?) can cause some bias by being too close to
saturation. There has to be a happy medium.

Even a poor random noise source that has some randomness can be distilled 
down to high quality random bits with a hash function, though. This takes 
some intelligent guessing as to how much of the data is noise, and how 
much is just a quantized, distorted version of the local radio broadcast.

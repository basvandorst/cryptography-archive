Not really as far as is known. I believe that with some large figure
like 10^15 selected plaintext - crypted text pairs you can reduce the
effort to 2^47 instead of 2^56 brute force steps. How you will get and
store 10^15 such pairs is of course up to you. DES was designed to be
safe by some bright people.

A while ago I was trying to find out exactly how the DES algorithm works, 
and I was unable to find a plain-english explanation on the internet, and 
all the good books had been ripped-off from the library. I tried wading 
through various C sources (I don't know too much C), but that was too 
much work. Finally I got my hands on a book (Cryptography And Data 
Security, DER Denning).

So now I have typed up a short DES how-to file. It is designed to tell 
you everything you need to know to use the DES algorithm in plain 
English. It is meant to be distributed electronically and as freely as 
export laws will allow, ie only in USA and Canada.

I am wondering if there is any interest in such a thing, and also if I 
have recreated something that already exists on the net that I was just 
unable to find before. If there is interest I will post this to sci.crypt 
with a distribution of usa,ca.

(I assume this will be perfectly legal as long as it stays in the USA and 
Canada. The algorithm is not copyrighted, to my knowledge.)

This was the official line until a few months ago - that A5 was strong and A5X 
a weakened export version.

However, once we got hold of A5 we found that it was not particularly strong -
there is an easy 2^40 attack. The government's line then changed to `you
mustn't discuss this in public because it would harm British export sales'.

Perhaps it was all a ploy to get Saddam to buy A5 chips off some disreputable
arms dealer type. On the other hand, Occam's razor suggests is was just the
usual bureaucratic blundering,

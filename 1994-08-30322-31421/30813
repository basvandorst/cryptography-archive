	I would be surprised if neural nets could be used to crack RSA, but
I *still* wonder if neural nets wouldn't be useful for searching for 
non-random properties in symmetrical block ciphers (IDEA, DES, 
Monoalphabetic Substitution ;-) ).  For example, the XOR of the 4th, 32nd,
and 64th bits of plaintext match the 1st bit of the key 60% of the time.
Stuff like this *does* seem to be something neural nets might be good at.
Am I mistaken, or are there just better techniques.  The obvious advantage
to using neural nets is that, to an extent, you get to search for all possible
wierd properties at once.

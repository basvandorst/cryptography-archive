No but think I know enough about Clipper 8*/. 
1) Will the FBI be able to just tap in ? - Not without a box having a 
duplicate of one of the chips in use and its key or something similar.

2) Will the FBI be able to mount a man-in-the-middle attack ? - This is a 
little different. To mount a man-in-the-middle, the FBI would not use a tap 
but a filter made up of two more Clipperphones. When you tell the clipphone 
to go secure after calling someone, the first FBI clip would negotiate a key 
with you while the second negotiates a different key with the "someone". 
Both phones report "secure" but the FBI can listen in on the clear line 
between their two clips. Incidently I am told that this is the *only* way 
GSM operates - in clear through the switch.

When I asked this question some time ago, I was told that the AT&T 3600 has
a display and in the case of a MIM attack, your display will not match that
of "someone" and you can ask on the secure(?) line. For the very very 
nervous, you could prearrange to only give the sum of the digits or what 
ever other authentication you feel like.

I would say it does.

The only hard info I've been able to come up with recently is this
excerpt from Hansard:

Source: Parliamentary Debates (Hansard) Thursday 21 April 1994
      : Written Answers

Mr. Llew Smith: To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what is
Her Majesty's Government's policy towards the use of private encryption
technology by individuals or companies to protect data sent by electronic 
mail.

Mr. McLoughlin: I have been asked to reply. It is a matter for the
individual, or company, to take measures, which may include private
encryption technology, which they consider necessary to safeguard their
electronic mail communication.

As far as I can see that makes it okay to do any encryption you like.
Anyone see any other interpretation?

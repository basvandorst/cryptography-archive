I switched because of the pseudocollisions, and because I can point people
at a US govt. standard for SHA (all other things being equal, having an
official standard for one of the algorithms gives it an advantage when
presented to people who won't use something unless it has "ISO", "X", or "US
government standard" as part of the name).

I haven't made the switch to SHA++ yet because I want to get more information
on why the change was made and what it fixes.  Although my original suspicions
that the weakness in SHA could be "its too easy to turn into a block cipher" 
have been allayed, I'd still like to see an explanation before I make the
switch.  See my comments when I posted the updated SHA code - is the one-bit
rotate merely a band-aid to avoid major redesign of large numbers of
Capstone chips, or is it really an optimal solution to the problem?

Peter.

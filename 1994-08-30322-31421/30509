   A while ago there was discussion of using dice for RNG.
I've been using a pair of dice and a 6x6 grid laid out with letters
and numbers. You get 5.17 bits of complexity per character with
this scheme.

Some people talked about using 10- and 12- and even 15-sided dice
from game shops.
   Recently a game shop opened in my neighborhood and I bought some
10- and 12-sided dice.
   The 10-sided die, used with a regular 6-sided die, gives 60
possible characters. I used upper and lowercase letters and digits
1 through 8. This scheme gives 5.91 bits of complexity per character.
   The 12-sided die was difficult to use. How do you fill 72
characters? Plus, the 6.17 bits of complexity was only a marginal
improvement (less than 1/3 bit) over the 10-sided die.

   Anyway, I have had much more trouble dealing with passwords from
the 10/6 dice pair than with with 6/6 dice pair. And there's not
much improvement in complexity either.
   If I want a 40-bits-of-security passphrase, I can get it with 8
characters of the 6/6 dice pair. If I use the 10/6 pair, I only
need 7 characters. Wow.
  For an 80-bits-of-security passphrase, it takes 16 rolls of the
6/6 pair, and 14 rolls of the 10/6 pair. For me, 't0iw7bfkf2wwh8ox'
is lots easier to memorize than 'plhGwgEy8TZCdl'. Those 2 extra
digits are more than offset by the need to memorize upper- and
lowercase.
   Plus, the 10-sided dice I have are all somewhat crooked. Here's
a result of some trial tosses:
Die face:     #hits:
1              4
2              19
3              9
4              11
5              9
6              12
7              12
8              5
9              12
0              10

After 103 tosses, the mean was 10.3 and the std was 3.95. Not as
random as I'd like.

So, the bottom line is that I'm sticking to plain old 6-sided
dice for password generation.

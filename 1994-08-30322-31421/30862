Quoting vote@dogwood.com in article <sci.crypt.research-CFV1.1@uunet.uu.net>:
>The submission address has not yet been determined.

I can't vote for this.

If the submission address is in the USA, then the people who run it may
face trouble for passing articles to non-US moderators.

If it is outside the USA, people within the US may face trouble for
mailing articles to it.  On the other hand, it would probably count as
crypto export to post articles to this newsgroup in the knowledge that
they will be distributed worldwide.

Please state the non-US submission address, and I promise my YES vote
will follow by return of post.  Something ending "cl.cam.ac.uk" or
"cs.aukuni.ac.nz" might be good.

By the way, messing with the "Followup-to" field without alerting the
user in the body of the post is a breach of manners.

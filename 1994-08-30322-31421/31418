PGP uses two encryption methods: the public-key part is RSA, the 
symmetric part is IDEA.  I'll let others to enlighten us on IDEA.

Couldn't help you there.  Though I wish to make a guess. :)

Alright, posted as well as emailed.

As a side note (as well as a proof that I have read the paper indeed 
:) I want to discuss a discussion in the paper that determining a/the 
private key (usually known as 'd') is as hard as factoring the 
modulus.  I believe it, in the following sense: factoring the moduli 
is polytime reducible to finding d.  The paper cited a reference to 
Miller, _G.L. Riemann's hypothesis and tests for primality_, Proc. 
Seventh Annual ACM STOC for factoring the modulus using any multiple 
of EulerPhi(modulus).

(Oh, darn, RH! :)

A while ago many people here believed that determining the private key 
might not be as hard as factoring the modulus, or factorization in 
general.  Does this mean they were wrong?

Maybe I should also take a look at Miller's paper.

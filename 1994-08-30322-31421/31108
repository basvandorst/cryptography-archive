Yes they took the people from the Quantum computing workshop there.
Nothing cryptographic there after WW2 essentially, but interesting nontheless- eg a
working hands-on enigma machine, and various displays thereof. A copy of
the Great Seal from the Moscow ambassedor's residence a la 1950'2,
various medals etc from the KGB private museum, old code books (eg
German naval codebook from 1892) It's worth a few hour's visit I'd say.
Not that it's easy to find although there is a sign on the Freeway- and
thena drive up a gravel backroad that you're sure must be wrong.
For the kids there is a free "codebreaking" workbook which mainly
discusses Ceasar type cyphers.

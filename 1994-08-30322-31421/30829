  ^^^^^^^^ This last sentence is gibberish. And the prior sentence is WRONG.
  I would call a problem that took about 1600 machines 8 months to solve
  difficult. Wouldn't you?

Flamethrower ON:

(1) It would be nice if you would learn to communicate in complete sentences.
    We are often judged by our ability to communicate and by our ability to
    elucidate our thoughts.
 
    If you can't say what you mean, how will others know that you mean what
    you say?


(2) I have followed this thread for a little while. NONE of you know what
    you are talking about.

    Firstly, someone talked about keys that were 10^15 times larger. If you
    knew anything about the subject (you obviously don't) you would know that
    the SIZE of a number is its number of digits or its number of bits, and NOT
    the VALUE of the number. A key that is 10^15 times larger than RSA-129 
    would have 1.29 x 10^17  DIGITS; The universe is not old enough or big
    enough to allow even a POLYNOMIAL TIME algorithm to break such a key.

    Secondly, I suggest you ALL do a little library research.

    The issue is not time, per se, but MONEY. One can cut the time by a 
    factor 1/n, by throwing n times as much money at the problem [i.e.
    n times as much hardware.


    The question is NOT "How secure is my key?", but rather, "How secure
    is my key for a period of time X if  Y dollars are thrown at the problem?"

Now will those of you who have not worked in this area please stop making this
ridiculous pronouncements? You are misleading others and misleading yourselves.


FLAME OFF.

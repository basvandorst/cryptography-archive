I would argue with this. I suggest that the criterium should
be something more like "the compressibility of the
cyphertext must not be dependent on the probability structure
of either plaintext and key." 

An example where Kagalenko's criterium is misleading:
Suppose we have a secure cipher.  After each n symbols
of ciphertext in this cipher, insert a linear function, yielding
a vecotr of m symbols,
of these n ciphertext symbols (perhaps for error correction).
If n is small, the resulting text can be easily compressed,
either by making a Huffman code for groups of n+m symbols,
or trivially by deleting the checksums.  Kagalenko's
criterium now says the cipher has become insecure.
Since this can be done to any cipher we have a contradiction.

: Two things you must do first (both are IMPORTANT)

: 1) Add at least two bits worth of forced-air noise to the sound when it is
:    recorded.  Forced-air noise is not really random, whereas crypto-text is.
:    The LSB's of the noise, however, will be more random-ish than the MSB's,
:    so if one's "truly-random" noise is WELL below the level of the audio
:    noise it should be fine.

: 2) Do *NOT* just replace the LSB of each sample with a bit of cryptext, but
:    instead ADD 0 or 1 to each sample to make the LSB match the cryptext.
:    Otherwise, especially at high sample rates, the LSB will stick out like a
:    sore thumb (each bit should have NO LESS than half the randomness of the
:    next-least-significant bit in a normal audio file.  ADDING 0 or 1 will
:    assure that half the randomness leaks to bit 1, half of THAT to bit 2, etc.
:    whereas otherwise bit 0 would be much more random than bit 1.)

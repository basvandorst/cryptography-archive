Because any attacker worth their salt will never let you get to the point of
using the destruction mechanism.  In addition what's needed is the ability to
protect, but also preserve, the information.  If what you're trying to keep
secret are the complete business records for your company, then revealing them
to an enemy may be preferable to destroying them altogether.

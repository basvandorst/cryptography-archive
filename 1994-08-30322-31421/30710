Hello, my name is Marlon Machado and I'm a Computer Science major at the
Univ. of South Alabama. I'm working on an implementation of the IDEA
encryption algorithm and I'm looking for any public domain source code. I
exchanged e-mail with Mr. Bruce Schneier and he suggested this newsgroup
as a possible good source of info. If any of you guys know where I can
find something related to IDEA, either a source code or a review paper,
I"ll appreciate your replies to this message (by the way, I have to submit
this project on Monday, Aug 15...).

Thanks in advance,

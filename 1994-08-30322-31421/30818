An oscillator based on a resonator, rather than the relaxation types
this thread has been discussing, would likely yield more controllable
jitter, since the jitter is related to the resonator Q.  You would
want a low-Q circuit, big wide grungy gain curve.

But all in all, it does seem like amplified Johnson noise is more
robust to implementation issues.  Why not try one of the FM IF
chips, like the MC13135 from Motorola (or any of the more narrowband
all-in-one receiver chips like the '3362)?  Lots of gain, you
can use the mixers to advantage, and you get a prelimited noise
waveform to feed to the synchronizer.

I think this just came up a few weeks ago (sorry if it's still the
same thread), but you want to watch for metastability, and Schneier's
book contains techniques to remove bias.  Also see Knuth for
statistical tests, and a random processes book for independence
issues when sampling bandlimited noise.

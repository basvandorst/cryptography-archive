Jeez, Mr. Silverman... lighten up, will you ?

You could have given a lot of folks a nice education on the issues 
without the flamage.  

What was it ?  Did you miss your Ritalin/Prozac dose, or was it just 
Monday ?

See below for specific responses...

It is poor netiquette to call someone on bad grammar.  Get a clue, bud.

: (1) It would be nice if you would learn to communicate in complete sentences.

It is poor netiquette to call someone on bad grammar.  Get a clue, bud.

: (2) I have followed this thread for a little while. NONE of you know what
:     you are talking about.

Ah ah ah, now, let's not resort to shouting - unless you want the net
to think you're a stark raving asshole.


:     Firstly, someone talked about keys that were 10^15 times larger. If you
:     knew anything about the subject (you obviously don't) you would know that
:     the SIZE of a number is its number of digits or its number of bits, and NOT
:     the VALUE of the number. A key that is 10^15 times larger than RSA-129 
:     would have 1.29 x 10^17  DIGITS; The universe is not old enough or big
:     enough to allow even a POLYNOMIAL TIME algorithm to break such a key.

:     Secondly, I suggest you ALL do a little library research.

And you need to do research on netiquette - just as badly as other posters
may need to get some math chops.


:     The issue is not time, per se, but MONEY. One can cut the time by a 
:     factor 1/n, by throwing n times as much money at the problem [i.e.
:     n times as much hardware.


:     The question is NOT "How secure is my key?", but rather, "How secure
:     is my key for a period of time X if  Y dollars are thrown at the problem?"

These points are spot on and are detailed nicely in Bruce Schniers' (sp?)
"Applied Cryptography".


: Now will those of you who have not worked in this area please stop making this

No, they don't have to - so there.  Last time I checked, the Net was not
owned by Mitre, nor were you the moderator of this newsgroup.  Thank
you for playing...and thanks for reinforcing the view of many that Mitre
is full of constipated assholes is dire need of a life.


: FLAME OFF.

Thank god...

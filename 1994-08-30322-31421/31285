There are two related problems here:

1.  Some people read news in order to avoid going to the library or
doing any actual study on the subject.  We've seen a lot of that
recently.

2.  People who don't know what they are talking about post opinions and
challenge those who do know to shoot them down.  When they get shot
down, they whine about how rudely they've been treated, and have the
nerve to tell us how we should conduct our discussions.

I welcome newbies here, but I urge them to spend a little time studying
the rudiments.

Re something substantive about the strength of RSA:  A number of
experts met in 1991 to consider questions like this. (EISS Workshop,
Oberwolfbach 1991.)  Their conclusion was:

"For most applications a modulus size of 1024 bit for RSA should
achieve a sufficient level of security for "tactical" secrets for the
next ten years.  This is for long term secrecy purposes, for short term
authenticity purposes 512 bit might suffice this century.

Please note:  Although the participants in this workshop feel best 
qualified in their respective areas, this statement (with respect to
long lasting security) should be taken with caution."

That's about as strong a consensus on the security of RSA as you're
ever likely to see.  I'm sorry if the newbies want more, but that's 
all the information they'll get without studying the algorithms
themselves.

There is no royal road to mathematics.

Andrew.

   I regret there is no (up to my knowledge) paper dedicated to the
   use of latin squares in cryptography.

"Finte Automata, Latin arrays, and Cryptography" by Tao Renji,
Institute of Software, Academia Sinica, Beijing. This (as yet
unpublished) paper covers several fascinating topics, including some
very fast public key methods -- unfortunately in too little
detail. Hopefully a published version will appear soon...

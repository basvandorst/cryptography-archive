Steven T. Degele has an interesting approach to cryptographic key stream
generation.  For more information, see

patent is too long to post, but I'll post small extract here.

Patent Number:				05297207
Inventor Name:				Degele; Steven T.

Abstract

A keystream generation system for producing a cryptographically secure
keystream by an "amorphous" process. Three types of keystream generation
are preferred. A large seed key is directly amorphously expanded into a
cryptographically secure keystream. A small seed key seeds a pseudo random
number generator whose output is made cryptographically secure through a
contracting amorphous process or, alternately, the security of an extended
keystream is strengthened through contraction. Finally, a state machine
whose output and transition functions are based on amorphousness
recursively operates on a seed key to generate an arbitrarily long,
cryptographically secure, keystream. The recursive performance of such
amorphous logical operations on seed keys in order to generate keystreams
is akin to the encryption of data.

                        BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
...
     The present invention will be seen to be concerned with the generation of
large, very-large, and indefinitely-large cryptographic keys as suit large
key cryptographic systems including, notably but not by way of limitation,
the one time pad. The way by which these large cryptographic keys are
derived will be seen to be analogous to cryptographic processes
themselves.
...
     In order to reach the present invention, it will be seen that (i) the
technologically obsolete notion of a small key is discarded, and then (ii)
the same ingenuity that Gilbert Vernam used is applied. Namely, or in
other words, it will be seen that the present invention calls for the
application of a bitwise transposition to a large incoherent key to
generate a keystream (subsequently usable for diverse cryptographic
processes in the encryption/decryption of data). The bitwise transposition
will be seen to include (i) substitution through selected XORings of the
"columns", and/or (ii) annihilation through skipping some of the "rows" in
each "column", and/or (iii) a method of multiplexing the columns. Finally,
as still another essential idea of the present invention, it will be seen
that this bitwise transposition is "amorphous", meaning that, complex as
the transposition may be in its substitutions and/or annihilations and/or
mutiplexing, it is (normally) repetitively recursively performed each time
in a different way.

     Cryptoanalysis of the amorphous transposition processes gives rise to a
mechanical correlation problem. The intractable nature of this problem
appears likely to be provable. Even if no proof of the cryptographic
security of one or more of the amorphous transposition processes of the
present invention is forthcoming, the apparent intractability of these
amorphous processes are arguably more attractive than any competing
cryptology systems having a supposed intractability of cryptoanalysis
based on number theory because the latter systems have an undesirable
profundity inherent in their fundamental objects such as the factoring
problem. This profundity is continually being revealed as further
mathematical research finds new structures which provide means for
realizing better algorithms to these problems.

     The bitwise transposition processes in accordance with the present
invention, on the other hand, will be seen to be, quite intuitively,
shapeless--hence the description "amorphous". The mathematical function(s)
defined by such an amorphous process(es) will be seen to be so random that
the prospects of finding any deep, analyzable, structures in the general
amorphous method(s) of the present invention appears to be quite remote.

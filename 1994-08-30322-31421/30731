   Do you know whether or not it makes it much harder to retrieve
the original (overwritten) data if you use a completely unknown (to
the attacker) string of bits to overwrite, or is it more important
to use the right portion of 0s and 1s?  (I'm inclined to suspect that
this depends on some very low-level details of the disk controller and
the coding scheme used on the disk, etc.)

   For a fast "kill" feature on any encrypted files, include a salt as
long as the key in the file's "encrypted file header" or whatever.
When you're hashing the passphrase, use this salt as part of the input
to the hash.  When you want to do a fast kill, overwrite just the salt
several times.  The key is no longer derivable from the passphrase.

   If you expect rubber-hose attacks, you probably want to document this
feature in big, hard to miss bold letters on the first page of the manual
and on all the help screens of your encryption program.  ("NOW, WITH FAST
KILL FEATURE!")

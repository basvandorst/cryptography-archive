True enough.  But the KGB bought the CIA's director of counter intelligence
for under US$ 2,000,000, his wife included.  Certainly Clipper can be
*socially* reverse-engineered for this amount; and this is about an hour's
cash flow for, say, the Medellin merchants.  

Are the Mycotronix computers secured in faraday cages?

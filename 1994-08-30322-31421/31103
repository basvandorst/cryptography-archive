   Wait a minute.  I thought magic squares were those things where the sum
   of columns are all equal as are the rows, and the diagonals.

   I thought that numbered squares useful for transposition were knight's
   tours of the chessboard.

Knight's tours have been used.  Let me demonstrate how magic squares
may be used with a toy example.  A 3x3 magic square is:

                     8 1 6
                     3 5 7 
                     4 9 2

Let the plaintext be "MAGICSQUARETRANSPOSITIONLMN" where I've added 3
nulls to make the plaintext be a multiple of 9 characters.  We write
in the text in the order of the numbers in the square to get:

UMS
GCQ
IAA

PRN
TAS
ROE

MSN
TOL
INI

Finally, we take off by rows and form five-letter groups, adding three
more nulls to disguise the size of the square used:

UMSGC QIAAP RNTAS ROEMS NTOLI NIFUR

Note, we could have pulled the usual tricks with transposition
ciphers, such as writing-in in order and taking-off by the magic
square.  Note, also, that the 3x3 square is rather smaller than would
ordinarily have been used.

I don't have my Gaines on me to post her challenge cryptogram, which
is why I made up my own.

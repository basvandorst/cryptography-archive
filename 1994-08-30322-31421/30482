What types of text files are you going to use to calibrate the frequency stats?
Archives of Sci.crypt?  USA Today online?  I'd like to suggest that we all download
your code and run it against sample text of interest to us, then post the findings
back here.  We might be able to calibrate the stats to specific disciplines.  <STS>

:"Period" ?  You are now in a position to tell us *for sure* that 
:foactoring is "difficult"?
 
It does not matter. Even if factoring can be done in polynomial time
you can still construct a key large enough to make factoring it
prohibitively expensive. Of course, encrypting also becomes expensive.

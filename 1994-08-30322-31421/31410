:>Q: What did the RSA-128 people do with all the numbers they found??
:
:There was no RSA-128 project.  The project before RSA-129 was RSA-120.
:
:Any numbers which might have been found on RSA-xxx were probably discarded.
 
Actually, I think the previous poster had the mistaken idea that RSA-129
was factored by generating primes and trying them as factors (i.e. trial
division).
 
I think this is what he means by "all the numbers [i.e. primes] they found"

Hi. I'm the author of Curve Encrypt.

One of the reasons you can't find it on a European server is that
distributing Curve Encrypt outside the U.S. is a violation of _copyright_,
not just ITAR.

How the hell is it supposed to end up on a European server without
anybody removing it illegally from the U.S.?

If and when the laws change, I'd love to see it exported. But until then,
if you like the software and want to see further development, DON'T EXPORT
IT! Consider keeping me out of legal trouble your Shareware fee.

And Vesselin, I would consider it a favor if you refuse to carry it.

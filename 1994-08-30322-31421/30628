Please don't quote out of context.  The "this" was a statement that it
transformed an input bit stream into an output bit stream.  *More* than
this (at least in the UK) is needed to be a "system".

I have no intention of building special purpose encryption hardware.  It is
quite possible that the PKP patent could be invoked were I to do so;  as
you say it would depend on the wording.  However I have run PGP on a PC.
The patent is statute barred (in the UK) from being invoked to prevent me
(irrespective of prior publication).

And you can quote US interpretations and precedents as much as you like.
They are not binding in other jurisdictions.  When two aspects of a law are
contradictory then it's up to the Courts to decide which is the more
important, and different jurisdictions may well decide differently.  In the
UK (for reasons which I described earlier in "The case against Software
Patents") the statute barring of software patents is regarded as important,
and artificial devices to get round it are disallowed.  Hardware in which
there is a software component may be patented as long as the only
innovation isn't in the software.

Doesn't it depend whether you allow for lift during the backstroke?

By the way, I suspect that it is known by everyone that bumble bees *do*
fly.  So an "aerodynamic proof" that they don't is a statement about
aerodynamics not a statement about bumble bees.

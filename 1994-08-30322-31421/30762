While reading this group, it seems that there is a level of interest in
these 900 mHz phones that goes beyond why I bought mine. Living in a high
density community like NYC, the odds of someone else having a "Freedom
Phone" operating at 49 mHz within a two block area are very high. Even
though I don have anything of National Security interest to talk about, I
do believe it is my business and not that of someone whose phone just
happens to be able to receive it. I therefore purchased the ATT version of
the Tropez which has digital transmission, different coding everytime it is
removed from the base station and uses spread spectrum to get the clearest
signal back to the base station. All of this pretty much gurantees that no
one in my area will ever be bothered by my conversations intruding into
theirs by accident or design. It also gurantees that I will not be troubled
by their interference. I am sure that if someone was sufficiently interested
in what I have to say that they wanted to tune in on some sideband or run it
all through a digital decoding system with alimentary algorithms, that they
could probably get into my conversations. However, at least I know that my
neighbors aren being bothered by them!

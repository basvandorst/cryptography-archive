I've tried this once before, but I got flamed to a crisp.

I would like to have a simple crypt program evaluated by posting the source
and possibly some sample encrypted text.  Is this an appropriate venue for
that sort of thing?  If not, what newsgroup would be appropriate?  Also, 
if I post source code am I going to have spooks knocking on my door for
"exporting" crypto technology (as if MY program could be dangerous)?

Thanks,
Paul

My comments are:

1. This should be in talk.politics.crypto (note the follow-up)

2. My original post concerned a very specific case: I ask those who are
   not US or Canadian citizens to refrain from downloading nCrypt from
   public sources. I am not concerned about the activities of the USA or
   any other government; I am expressing my wishes as the creator of the
   software.

3. The best way to distribute crypto software in Finland is to write it
   and give it away. The widespread distribution of non-American crypto
   is likely the most effective argument against export controls. Simply
   passing ur stuff around will just make some people more paranoid.

Please vote for the proposed new group soc.history.science. 

Look for the following post (CFV or Call for Votes) which gives the 
voting instructions:

peterb@telerama.lm.com (Peter G.  2nd CFV: soc.history.science

This has been posted in the following newsgroups (ran out of room to post
it everywhere of interest--some software has a 200 character limit on
crossposting): 
news.announce.newgroups,
news.groups,
sci.astro,
sci.bio,
sci.chem,
sci.engr,
sci.geo.geology,
sci.math,
sci.med,
sci.misc,
sci.philosophy.tech,
sci.physics,
sci.psychology,
soc.history

CHARTER

soc.history.science will discuss the history of science in the broad sense:
including the history of the physical sciences, history of the biological
sciences, history of the social sciences, history of medicine, history of
technology, history of mathematics, philosophy of science, and related
areas.

RATIONALE

soc.history.science is needed because although the history of science is
an area of significant and growing interest, currently discussion is spread
out over dozens of science and history newsgroups, each with only occasional
scattered postings (plus several mailing lists).

A mailing list gatewayed to this group will be created so that
people who do not have access to Usenet groups will be able to read the
group (Cold Spring Harbor Lab has volunteered to do this). This is new
information since the CFV was issued.

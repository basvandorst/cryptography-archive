For those interested in the discussion... the point was to find p,q if
you know a multiple of lambda(n)... method suggested... pick a, if it is
relatively prime to n (if not, you have factored n) and k is the
multiple, take x=a^(2^k) and the GCD(x-a,n) the claim being that the
prob is fairly large that this is p or q (not just n or 1).

Attempt (here) to show that it can be 1 for all but 2/SQR(n) values (not
likely to happen).

Suppose p-1=2A, q-1=2B where A-1<>2B and B-1<>2A, neither A nor B is 3,
A,B prime, 2 a primitive root mod A and mod B (hope this can be done!)
and let k=r*lambda(n) (r another prime... bigger than A and B, say) (A,B
large, say... in particular, not 2 either!).

The number of elements a which produce a GCD divisible by q or p is
(shown last time):

 pGCD(2^k-1,B)+qGCD(2^k-1,A)

Claim is that the GCDs are both one, so this is just p+q, on the order
of 2/SQR(n).

The only way that one of the GCDs is not one, is if, say A divides
2^k-1... but I said that 2 was a primitive root... that is A-1 divides
k, or A-1 divides 2rAB... as r and A are relatively prime to A-1, this
means A-1 divides 2B... only divisors are 1,2,B,2B... A-1 isn't 1 or 2
(A is not 2 or three) and if A-1=B, then A is even, not prime... so
A=2B+1... and that does not happen... so the second GCD is one, so is
the first and the number of terms that "work" (in providing a GCD that
is p or q) is less than (some have GCDs of pq which does not help
factor) p+q.

Nope... something is wrong with the method (or my analysis of it,
above).

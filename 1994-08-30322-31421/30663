 In <Cu8opK.15z@dorsai.org> stevalln@dorsai.org (Steve_Allen)
 presents his physically-random RNG design.


 Subsequent research has found figure 5.30 in [1] which seems to be
 quite similar to the jittering oscillator in the RNG design;

      +--R1--+--||--+
      |      |   C  |      R1 = 10 R2
      |      R2     |
      |      |      |      (but R1 and R2 are reversed in the RNG
      | |\   | |\   |       design, and R1 ~= 6.7 R2)
      +-|  o-+-|  o-+---
        |/     |/

 their comments are:

      "Sometimes you need an oscillator with very low noise
      content (also called "low sideband noise").  The simple
      circuit of 5.30 is good in this respect.  It uses a pair
      of CMOS inverters . . . connected together to form an RC
      relaxation oscillator with square wave output.  Actual
      measurements on this circuit running at 100 kHz show
      close-in sideband noise power density . . . down at least
      85 dB relative to the carrier."  [1:285-286]

 Thus, the oscillator is not chaotic, nor do we normally expect
 the resistors or internal noise to be a major factor, unless the
 reversal of values does this.  On the contrary, it is a design
 we expect to be particularly stable and noise-free.  This leaves
 supply-voltage sensitivity as the likely source of jitter, and
 this is a very predictable effect.

 So, unless we find something unexpected, this sort of oscillator
 would not seem to be a good choice as the main source of
 randomness in a physically-random RNG.

 This is actually an interesting result, for it allows us to
 calibrate our testing procedures.  If they do not find this
 problem, they will certainly be unable to deal with the more-
 subtle problems associated with real noise.

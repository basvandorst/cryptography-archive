   I am not aware of any.


However, I am.  Back in the good old days, one of the transposition
ciphers used magic squares for writing in, or taking out, blocks of
text.  One of Gaines' problems is a magic-square transposition cipher.
If there's enough interest, I'll post the ciphertext.

I do not know of any modern, non-toy cryptographic uses of magic
squares.

   What is so NP hard about them?! There are trivial and fast methods to
   construct magic squares of any order. The odd-order ones are

Not so fast, young man!  Some magic squares of small orders containing
only consecutive integers can be created easily.  Others are much more
tricky.  Here's a challenge for you: construct a non-trivial magic
square containing only positive prime integers.  If you fail, a quick
search through the last 2 decades of Scientific American will produce
an example for you.  (You didn't expect me to give a precise
reference, did you?  That would make it far too easy to cheat 8-)

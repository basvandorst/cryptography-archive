I don't actually know quantum all that well, so I would appreciate it
if someone more knowledgeable could correct any errors here, but:

I don't think you can have a particle with a definite zero momentum.
Since you are defining it's position at some time t=0, then there must
be a resulting uncertainty in it's momentum  -- (delta x)(delta p) >=
(h-bar)/2.  So it would seem to me that you can't know where the
particle is going to be after some time.

Which is not to say that quantum shouldn't provide some interesting
uses in cryptography, but I think that this idea may need some more
work. You might be able to get such a scheme to work for at least some
time (you could have an upward bound on (delta p) and (delta x), so
you could perhaps build a device with a one-read key that also has a
built in lifespan....

 Launch Voyager - like device, powered by durable nuclear reactor, to reach
 a great deal into space, so that signal send to it and bounced back would
 take, say a year. Don't think it is technically unfeasible even now. The
 obvious flaw would be capture of the key during the transmission. That
 can be dealt with  by using antenn aperture much larger then wavelength
 (might require short wavelength, i.e., visible or even gamma), so that
 beam produced would be very thin.

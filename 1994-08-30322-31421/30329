False. RSA is patentable in Europe but cannot be patented because of prior
publication. IDEA was patented in Europe.

Neither patent is an algorithm patent. Both are system patents, which are
perfectly proper both in Europe and in the U.S.

You may use the algorithm all you want if it is patented, but not in a
system to encrypt or decrypt material without violating said patent.

taken to extremes the spurious notion of freedom without responsibility, and

are told by their pals that they are in the middle of the road. Nothing is
wrong any more (except, of course, conservative thoughts and expressions).

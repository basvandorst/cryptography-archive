I'm looking for elliptic curve public key cryptosystems source code (El Gamal,
etc). I've been looking for a while but I really found nothing. Though I have a 
good book about this subject, I'd really like to see some 'real life' 
implementations. Maybe someone could  mail me source code or give me advice 
where to find something. 
			
	Thanks in advance,

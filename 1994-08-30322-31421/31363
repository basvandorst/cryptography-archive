Actually, using Z'(n) being isomorphic to Z'(a)xZ'(b) where n=ab and a,b 
are relatively prime and knowing that:

Z'(p^n) is isomorphic to Z(p^(n-1))+Z(2^u)+Z(U) where p-1=2^u*U and U is 
odd (for odd p... this is just lambda(p^n)=Phi(p^n))

(Z(1)) is the trivial group

Z'(2) is iso to trivial group

Z'(4) is iso to Z(2)

Z'(2^n) is iso to Z(2)+Z(2^(n-2)) (follows from the format of 
Lambda(2^n)) and -1 has a component in the Z(2) term mod 2^n

(note... if -1 has components in Z(2^a(i)) and a(0) is one with the 
lowest size, one can use a new isomorphism to have -1 only having a 
non-zero component in Z(2^a(0))... the reason I used -1 is because it has 
all components in the power of two order part of Z'(n)... but you can 
change isomorphism for any number with some components in the power of 
two part) (note that if there is a Z(2) component for which -1 has a 
component... heck any a... that is equivalent to -1 not being a quadratic 
residue... in particular if 4 divides n or any prime which is equivalent 
to 3 mod 4 divides n, then -1 is not a QR).

Using the decomposition, as long as n (assumed odd) has two different 
prime factors the method will help to factor n (if one knows n and a 
multiple of lambda(n)... if n is just a power of a prime though, there is 
only one Z(2^a) term, so the only square roots of one are 1,-1... 
so one cannot get a non trivial square root of one).

In fact, if you know C is Carmichael, use C-1 as a multiple of lambda(C) 
and get factors a,b... use C-1 again mod a,b to try to factor a,b... and 
then the resulting factors. Carmichaels can be factored

The method works (point of this post) in general (as long as n has at 
least two different prime factors) to partially factor n.

You can 'break' lockup by rebooting your computer.  It doesn't lock 
on startup.  Also if you need to change your password, bring up the desktop
menu (right mouse on desktop), click the arrow next to open, open settings,
select lockup (near the bottom), and then click the right arrow until you
get to the third page.  You can then change the password.

Hope this helps,
   Doug

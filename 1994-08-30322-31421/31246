OK I would be willing to give this a shot.  But the last one I
got by ftp was in weird format--like it was all one line a
zillion characters long and *poof* went another fuse in my
editor.  We subscribe here to FAQs, too.  Only this one is
unreadable, like _always_ unreadable.

I don't know, I think it is kind of _charming_ that a group like
this has an unreadable FAQ.  :-)

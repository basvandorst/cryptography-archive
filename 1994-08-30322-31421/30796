   My understanding is that if the MITM had two clipper phones it would be
no problem. Your phone talks to (echanges keys with) MITM#1, who sends the
unencrypted voice to MITM#2, who has exchanged keys with "the party with
whom you are speaking".

   Note (I believe) that this is a general problem with schemes that build
the keys on the fly, without authentication.

In DH, you have a system-public modlus P and generator a.
Alice and Bob each choose a random exponent (x and y, respectively)
and exchange a**x and a**y (both mod P).  Alice and Bob can
now each calculate a**(xy) to obtain the session key, and
then destroy x and y, and when the session is over they should
destroy the session key also.  The only public keys are
the public keys of the whole system (P and a).  The only secret
keys are the transient x, y and a**(xy).

Yes.

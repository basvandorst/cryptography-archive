We're listening.

>(1) The Riemann Hypothesis does NOT imply that pi(N) is approximated by
>li(N).  Pi(n) *is* approximated by li(N). This is a THEOREM known as the

Say Robert... just because other assumptions can lead to this
approximation, does not mean that the Reimann hypothesis doesn't
imply it.

Some mathematical results can be derived from several 
different sets of assumptions.  Any one of those assumptions
can (and should) be said to "imply" the result.

Quit trying to confuse things.

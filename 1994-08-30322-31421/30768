If strong enough, probably, but it renders the disk unusable, since it
will also destroy the servo tracks - the tracks the voice coil head
mechanism uses to tell what track it is on, etc, so one cannot reformat
it by usual means.  The servo tracks are not user accessable, and requires
the heads to be MECHANICALLY indexed, while the track is re-written.
Only some drive repair facilities have the means to re-write the servo
tracks.

Even overwritting the tracks is not for sure - since the microscopic
backlash in the head indexing means that areas on the fringes of the
tracks may not get overwritten reliably (how much effort is the enemy
willing to expend to get the data?).  That is why truly secure procedures
require destroying the drive.  If an adequate field were applied
externally, it would also de-magnetize the permanent magnets in the head
drive assembly, too, as well as the above-mentioned servo tracks (not to
mention the effects of induced voltages in the electronics).  Only
drives that used stepping moters, with their physical indexing to move
the heads lack the servo tracks.

This is why so many drives always seem to have an odd number of useable
heads - the 'unused' platter surface is where the servo tracks live.

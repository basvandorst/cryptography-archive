   Hmmm.  I suspect it uses RSA for public key functions, and a different
encryption algorithm for the actual bulk encryption.  RSA is really too
slow to use for bulk encryption.  Perhaps they use Rivest's ciphers ,
RC2 or RC4?  Kept down to 40 bits or less, they're exportable.  RSA
keys are probably kept down to 512 bits or less.

I hope you mean ONE OF THE submission sites. Otherwise any U.S. citizen who
submits stuff is exporting it, and may in some cases be taking a chilling
risk. There should be a U.S. submission site for U.S. readers, a European
submission site for European readers, and how the stuff gets back and forth
is a matter between the organizers of the newsgroup, and their consciences or
local laws.

   A new release of CFS, my encrypting file system for Unix-ish platforms,
   is now available,  This version includes a number of bug fixes and ports
   to new platforms, reasonably friendly hooks for adding new ciphers, and an
   online 3-DES mode.  Details in the announcement attached below.

   ...

   New features in CFS 1.1 include:

   * User-contributed ports to a number of additional platforms.

   * Better hooks for adding new ciphers.

   * 3-DES encryption option.

   ...

   Because of export restrictions on cryptographic software, we are only
   able to make the software available within the US and Canada to US and
   Canadian citizens and permanent residents.  Unfortunately, we cannot
   make it available for general anonymous ftp or other uncontrolled
   access, nor can we allow others to do so.  Sorry.

How about breaking it up into two packages (like the info-zip people
do)?  If you make a CFS which has everything but replaces the
encryption routines with skeleton routines, then there shouldn't be
any export restrictions on it.  Then other people (US &
non-US) could distribute CFS encryption routine packages.  To get the
complete system working one would have to pick up your CFS & pick up
one of these encryption routine packages.  I'm sure that compatible
encryption code will quickly showup on ftp.funet.fi, ...

Just an idea,

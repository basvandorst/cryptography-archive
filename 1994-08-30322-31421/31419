Yes, I agree these spaces are too large to exhausitvely search.
I was responding to somebody who said that some RSA implementation
drew primes from a space containing "billions" of primes,
a considerably smaller number than 1e74.

Even a well-funded adversary could probably not field more
than 2**25 processors which each locate a prime per microsecond,
or 2**45 primes/year/processor, or 2**70 primes checked in
a year.   And that would be stretching it.  It would take
some elaborate custom hardware to find a strong prime in
a microsecond.

Searching over 2**250  primes is out of the question.

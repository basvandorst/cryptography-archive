Hmm... I don't think so. But maybe someone from RSADSI will comment.

I've written some code that does LUC based on the GNU GMP library. It 
is slower than RSA with the same library, but by less than a factor 
of two. 

However, what I have is far less than a complete public key system 
for use with Email &c. like PGP or any of the various PEM 
implementations. 

I'm not going to proceed any further and implement a full system for 
practical public key cryptography. There are a few toy driver 
programs, but that is it. 

But if you want some code to implement LUC to play with, and you are 
in the U.S. or Canada and a Canadian/U.S. citizen/permanent resident, 
you can fetch it and a bunch of other information on LUC from 
ftp.wimsey.bc.ca in 
/pub/crypto/software/dist/US_or_Canada_only_XXXXXXXX/LUC

The LUC code itself is in l3-1.3b.tar.gz

I'll repeat myself and say again, that this is just a toy. It would take
significant work to make a public key system for communications based
on it.

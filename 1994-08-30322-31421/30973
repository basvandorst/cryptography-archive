Quite right. I should have said 'except those which incorporate the Gemstar
VCR+ circuitry themselves'. The point we were discussing was 'what good is a
VCR+' in contrast to setting up a (conventional) VCR to record'. Owning one
of the newer VCRs which includes VCR+ is, of course, like owning a VCR+.
Either can switch a cable box needed to decode and record channels scrambled
on the cable feed itself, as conventional VCRs cannot.

Yes you are right, L= ln(N) where N is the number not log2(N).
I would absorb the o(1) into the definition on O(), but fine.
And I assume that your post giving the coefficient as 1.092 was a typo
and not a malicious attempt to mislead as well.
Perhaps the original questioner now has enough info to get a feeling for
the answer to his question.

yes... I reported this late last week... and am still researching it. My
phone though, is the Tropez 900 DL which is not spread-spectrum but 
digitally modulated on single carriers within the 900 MHz band.  What I
have found is that there is some leakage of in-the-clear audio in the
430 MHz amateur band from the handset.  Others have found and reported
similar signals.  I am trying to get someone from VTech (the manufacturer
of the phone) to discuss this with me...  but they seem to be having trouble
returning my calls.

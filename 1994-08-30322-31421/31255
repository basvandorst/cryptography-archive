I would like to see code posted here, because it is very much part of
what I see the group is intended for, but I suspect it cannot happen.

It is more and more like Martin's anology is holding and will continue
to do so:  The 'new, improved, modern' answer is to just let the rapos
robbers, etc out early (and push for more draconian infringements to
'fix' the resulting 'crisis'), and then build more prisons to hold the
'politically incorrect' (defined as those who think the Const/BoR means
what it says instead of what our 'betters' say it means this week, or
those who think crimes should be defined as activity that produces a
clear and identifiable victim).

With the latest victory of our Loving Leaders (disarming the non-criminal
of cosmetically incorrect firearms - all 279 of them going by the most
recent rumbles from the BATF - is somehow going to make the criminal
behave), the votes for which were purchased by providing funds for every
liberal's pet social program, and trimming it with pork to get the
holdouts.  Note that the gun part - the part that blatantly violated
the Constitution - was the ONLY part that was not negotiable.  With
this, and the expected bill next session requiring registration and
banning of just about everything else (Brady II), the government is well
on its way to being in the position to say (as Dung Tsau Ping effectively
said):

"You don't like it, dirt bag?   Wotarya think ya are gonna do about it?"

If they cannot find jail or 're-education camp' space, they can trash
you financially to remind you who is boss, simply by bringing assorted
CIVIL* charges, like obscure tax beefs, or whatever against you.  Remember
the gov't gets to define what the law means, not the peon.  Also, the
govt is more inclined to lean on those they know lack the resources to
effectively fight back (called selecting a 'soft' target), and end up
taking away what little the person has including any real future in our
'Kinder, Gentler, New World Order'.

*The scheme of using civil law conveniently ensures that if one cannot
afford an attorney or adequeate defense, they are screwed, as it has
been declared by Those Who Know Best that the protections provided in
the Bill of Rights only applys to those facing CRIMINAL charges.
Therefore, the right to adequate representation only applies to CRIMINAL
cases.  This is how they get around the 4th Amendment for civil forfeiture
without so much as even charging the person, let alone a conviction,
due process, etc.  If one cares to check, one will find the misuse of
civil law is being used quite extensively as an end-run around the
Constitution 'for our own good'  - by those sworn to 'uphold and defend'
the US Constitution.  Problem is, they only do so when deemed expedient.
Yet they continue to be re-elected, cuz they continue to promise something
for nothing.

I would be very concerned if the gov't decides to crack down on private
crypto, and I think they will 'for your own good'.  It could get very
unpleasant for ftp sites or people even writing such stuff and making
it available (the PGP thing I suspect is a 'feeling of the waters' to
see what can be gotten away with).  This is evidenced by the admitted
goal of the Administration to not budge on ITAR, and to misuse it to
achieve their ends.  And the passage of the wiretap bill (which is
quietly sailing through congress right now) will ensure this, if not
now, very soon by setting the precident of REQUIRING fishing-expedition
friendly communications.  And nothing better to 'make an example' of
than some schmuck posting something that is deemed verboten after the
fact, who is just able to live from paycheck to paychedk, and putting
that person up as a 'threat to national security'.  I wouldn't hold up
much hope for sheer numbers helping one out - any more than it helps
for bringing an end to Prohibition II (the fact that Prohibition failed
miserably then and is failing now is immaterial, as I see it is simply
an excuse to grab more power and institute more centralized control).

I suspect you will find few people who desire to become martyrs, either
literally or economically.  That is how governemnt controls - through
FEAR, and when that fails, through naked force (hence the desire to
disarm the population).

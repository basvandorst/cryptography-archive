Those books are for crypto systems that can trivially be broken with 
"sufficent work" (modern type systems)... for an understanding of how 
much information one needs to break a system with an arbitrary amount of 
work (one time pads cannot be broken) one should also look at entropy 
(even physics books... which have more theorems on it) and information 
theory... which also leads to compression.

Just a few more things one needs to know (and don't forget advanced 
algebra... galois theory, cyclotomic polynomials and elliptic stuff... 
not to mention.... welll enough... learn math/CS etc.)

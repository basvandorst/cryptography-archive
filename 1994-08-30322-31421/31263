Hmm.  It seems to me that if there are only a billion (2**30)
primes in the range, then a brute-force search through these
should lead to a viable attack.

I recommend a distributed-computing effort a la RSA-129 to
look for and compile a list of these primes.  Finding even, say,
100,000 of them, and making these available to cryptanalysts,
would compromise the security of RSA to an unacceptable level.
(If the figure of one billion is in range...)

The idea is to amortize the cost of finding primes over
a large number of cryptanlyses, so that each individual
cryptanalysis need only perform a bunch of long divisions.

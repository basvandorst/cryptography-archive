Although it is difficult to authenticate an image,
it is relatively easy to establish criteria that says
two different images are "essentially" the same,
such as the RMS error signal being below some threshold.
If both images were signed and authenticated, and the
RMS error was low, this would prove one signer's claim
that either he obtained the image from the other signer,
or vice-versa.  (Positive authentication.)

Unfortunately, if the goal is anti-pirating (negative
authentication), any such metric can probably be gotten around
by cropping, warping, non-linear mapping, etc.

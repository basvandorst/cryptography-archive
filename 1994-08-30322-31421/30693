 Keeping RNG-generated keys for floppies on HD (encrypted). Wipe hard drive - no
 way to decrypt floppies. 

  Think sci.crypt crowd is paranoid ? Read yesterday Wall Street Journal, about
 Berkeley HUD suing and fining people for peaceful protesting of
 housing project in their neighborhood (under non-descrimintaion laws. Apparently,
 heroin addiction is considered involuntary disablity). Demanding activists to 
 produce the lists of participants in protest. Nice democratic style, eh ?

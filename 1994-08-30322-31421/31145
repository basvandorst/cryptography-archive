I assume you are talking about making tables of primes?  If so, this is way out of the question; the problem here is that the table would have to be of immense magnitude and size that there is no way in hell you could store it.  This is feasible for small numbers, but just think, with an average of 10 numbers per hundred being prime, if you wanted all the primes from 10^40 to 10^41 (just for example), then you are going to have a table with 10^39 40 digit numbers.  I don't care what kinda of compression yo
u are using; that is far more than you have available on disk. :)

In reference to the 1977 deal, this depends on speed, alg, etc.  But, you would probably not have enough.  If you had to test each number for primality, and say, even counted by 2's starting with 3, you would be lucky to be at 10^15 or 10^20 with 1977 super high tech technology.  

There are some formulas which yield mostly prime numbers and whatnot, but
the idea of RSA numbers are that the two prime candidates are chosen to be not easily obtained.  I don't know what extent is done to ensure they are "good", but I imagine a simple alg wouldn't be the answer. :)

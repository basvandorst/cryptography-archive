      "Weak" Pseudoprimes and Factoring of N=P*Q

      Baillie and Wagstaff(1) and also Monier(2) have shown that every
composite number N, not a power of 3, is a pseudoprime to some bases a,
1<a<N-1. The number of such bases vary and cannot be calculated without
knowing the factorization of N. Finding any one of such bases is usually
sufficient to factor N.
      While, in general, finding such bases is rather ardous for large N
there are mitigating circumstances that can be exploited to make it more
reasonable. Here are a couple of observations on the subject:
      1. One can "tenderize" N by multiplying it with a prime R
such that R-1 has a common factor with N-1 larger than 1,
      2. Some of the bases may be solutions of the Diophantine equation,
         a^3 = 1 (mod N),
      3. Some of the bases may be UFMs.
      4. All bases are related in that a(j) = N - a(i), etc.
      By "tenderizing" the number N one will not necessarily increase the
probability of finding a valid base but, as the experience shows, such
a procedure can drastically affect the distribution of such bases in the
region of interest. More importantly, the procedure can reduce the value
of the lowest base for which N is a weak pseudoprime. Here is an example
to illustrate the procedure:
       N = 96709
       No. bases = 143
       a(min) = 5237
Now, multiply N by R=13,
      gcd(N-1,R-1) = 12
      M = N*R = 1257217
      No. of bases = 1727
      a(min) = 161
Both of the above bases can be used to factor N but, obviously, it is cheaper
to find the second one. Incidently, in both cases the probability of finding
a base remain pretty much the same.
      As is the case with many of the proposed factoring schemes, the ultimate
utility of this scheme remains to be assessed in the context of a good-sized
N, say,RSA129, etc. If you have experience with this or a similar scheme, let
me hear from you.

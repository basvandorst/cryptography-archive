When I checked more than a year ago the European Patent Office were
just a shell. The patents they issued did not give the one who got it
any kind of exclusive rights except possibly within the European Patent
Office itself.
They used to grant patents on modified human beings.

I think that for a patent to be valid in Germany it must be granted
by the German Patent Office.

X Very interesting.  Samples of what size?  Do you have any references or

The gov't requirements are classified except for the standard probability
and frequency distribution stuff. sorry.

X rate I'm using that many 5K samples would require almost 1400 hours.  Or 
X did you mean samples of size 1X10^6?  Still, if duty calls...

One CONTINUOUS sample of 1X10^6 (or larger).

good luck-

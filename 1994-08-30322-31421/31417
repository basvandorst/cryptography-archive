Not really.  Without GRH or RH, one can prove easily (!) (hee) that 
the limit of pi(x)/(x/log(x)) is 1 as x approaches infinity.  Of 
course the problem is you don't see the error term here, so you aren't 
sure of its magnitude.

Even easier to prove is the Chebyshev's bounds, i.e. there exists 
constants b and c such that bx/log(x) <= pi(x) <= cx/log(x).  So once 
you hunt down b and c you have a sense of the error.  Then choose x 
large enough so that the error is not large enough to make your 
search-range prime-deficient.  Done.

Wait, let's see what you people are talking about --- prime-search 
attack?!  Do you know what it takes to search through 10^74 primes?  
(That's for 512-bit moduli in RSA.)  And if you talk about moduli of 
more bits, mind you pi(x) is strictly increasing.  If you have trouble 
searching through pi(2^256) primes, you are going to have more trouble 
searching through pi(2^257) primes, not same or less.

People, please... take an astronomy course and appreciate how large 
10^74 is.

Even Pollard's Rho is much faster than that.

We should include at least one factorization method other than trial 
division in the high school curriculum.  Or else don't teach 
factorization or the fundamental theorem of arithmetics at all. :)

Thank goodness the Euclidean method for GCD/HCF is included.  I don't 
want to talk to people who find GCDs by factorization.  (Just kidding.  
Actually I'd love to explain the Euclidean method.)

And I always thought that p /= np-complete because if, for example,
the complexity of one space is n while another is 2^n, then they
could not be of the same measure by a diagonalization proof, just as
aleph-sub-one is incommensurable with aleph-sub-zero -- two other
spaces one of whom is the power set of the other.

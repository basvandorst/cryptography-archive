Apparently not.

: RSA can be made as safe AS YOU WANT. Period. The amount of safety depends
: on the useful lifetime of the information. 

"Period" ?  You are now in a position to tell us *for sure* that 
foactoring is "difficult"?

Or that if it *isn't* difficult that it will be X years before it will
be found to be easy?

If you're going to post like this, Bob, I <for one> would appreciate
your adding the appropriate qualifiers, such as IMO, IMHO, or "with
the best publicly known algorithms today".

I would further suggest that we now stop the bantering this thread has 
taken on and discuss the science of cryptography.

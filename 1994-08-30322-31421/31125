Yes, it may.  As I've pointed out, some small but non-ignorable fraction
of military and diplomatic transmissions contain information
that will remain sensitive several decades into the future.

One would not want the security of these dependent upon
some mathematical breakthrough not happening.

An aside, there is enough publicly-available information
about military cryptography for one to guess that
private-key cryptography seems to be the norm.  This
may be because there is a lack of a safe enough public-key
algorithm (including RSA); but my own guess would be that, 
given the overall requirements, there is little or no
cost saved or convenience gained by employing public-key
vs. private key.

Regarding Terry Ritter's noise experiments:  I have used reversed biased 
b-e junctions with success.  I recently tried Terry's suggestion to me in 
email of using one op-amp open-loop, instead of two feedback amplifiers.  
It works justs as well as the two-amp setup.  Viewed on a spectrum 
analyzer, the noise appears random, but pink; i.e. falling off about 3db 
per octave, more or less.

Be careful of power-supply regulation, bypassing, and short leads, or you 
will indeed build a radio/60/120Hz receiver, as one of the other posters 
noted.

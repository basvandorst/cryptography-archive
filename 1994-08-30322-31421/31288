No doubt several people will echo my sentiments, which is that this type of
challenge is relatively meaningless. You sound like you're trying to
evaluate the security of your algorithm. If so...

1) Post the algorithm itself. Let people attack it, not its output

2) Post your design decisions. Why your algorithm instead of DES, Blowfish,
or any of the others? What problems do they have that your algorithm
solves?

3) Post the results of your own attempts to crack it. What attcks is it
especially strong against? What attacks do you conjecture may work against
it?

Good luck.

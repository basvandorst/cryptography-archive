I have *never* posted a message like this before in this usenet group,
for this usenet group is for the discussion of the science of
cryptography (*not* for instructing people on how poor their math
educattion is if they do not know the current terms for things) and I
never will again (promise... means, not even replies in public to
replies to this).

--Paragraph devoted to the science of cryptography to validate
  this message for acceptance in this UseNet group-----

People have asked me what books they should read if they were interested
in cryptography... I suggested... books on algebra, combinatorics,
linear algebra (over modules), number theory, calculus (to be able to
understand...), analytic number theory (for many of the asymptotic
results), modern Ramsey theory (for counter examples), special numbers
(for counter examples), general math knowledge.

(I don't think trigonometry appears, though I have seen it used in some
 analytic number theory stuff, where one needs Fourier material... so
 that leads to trigonometry and functional analysis)

(note... none on cryptography!)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

And then I have seen people complain that people asked questions here
"without having done their homework" (all ten years of it?) to
understand the questions and on top of that be familiar with the recent
publications in cryptography.

(oops... forgot to include books on computational complexity, what P, NP
and NPC is along with other complexity classes... <sigh>)

Those *are* the things to read and know in order to understand *all* of
cryptography (applied math, and each of the above has an application to
Cryptography).

There are *newbies* here who want to learn about cryptography (one asked
if NP meant non-polynomial... one response was that the person should
read more on complexity, my response was a simple explanation of what
non-deterministic polynomial meant).

Yes... this is my first and last political post here.

Someone asks a simple question... instead of a simple answer and a
pointer to more information we see a *flame* against the poster, then a
*flame* against the responder, then a *flame*...

nonsense.

I have *never* posted other than math oriented (science of cryptography)
material here before this... but attacks on newbies because they are not
experts in a particular field (my field is funtional analysis... not
number theory, maybe I should not post here) seems to be unwarranted.

Again... I will never again (OK... for the next year, at least) publicly
post political material... my posts from now on (for a year at least)
will be as they have always been... answering some questions, asking
some, posting algorithms and posting counter examples to suggested
algorithms (mostly for RSA which is my main interest now). The proper
subject of sci.crypt.

But when I read three articles about factoring... followed by two on why
they shouldn't have been posted (no math stuff in the responses, all
political) followed by more articles on factoring (with answers to
the first three) I wonder why the two political articles were posted...
and so I have never posted responses (if we all did, this place would
be filled with political sh*t) (*=a vowel, if you are interested).

But, it has just gotten on my nerves *so* much, that I figure that,
having posted so much math stuff, and never having posted a political
message before, I could get away with *one* political post per year
(though it is not proper in this group) saying...

Help people, don't yell at 'em.

OK... they are new, don't know some stuff... teach 'em... if not, at
least don't chase 'em away before the people who would help them have a
chance to do so.

P.S. Check my prior posts for the several months I have been here, if
     you find any other that is not devoted to the math/science of
     cryptography, let me know. Most of them are devoted to the math of
     RSA (much more than the simple Fermat's Little Theorem approach
     given in Schneier's "Applied Crytography") and some questions and
     answers about things "everyone knows" about RSA (some of which are
     false). SO... please, check my other posts if this is the first
     from me you have read, you will see that this is the *only*
     political post I have made... and the last for a year.

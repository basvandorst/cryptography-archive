A5 was disclosed in message <2ts9a0$95r@lyra.csx.cam.ac.uk>. It can be broken 
with a 2^40 attack (guess registers 1 and 2). There may well be faster attacks,
as reported in that posting.

Ross

from the original posting:

A5 is a stream cipher, and the keystream is the xor of three clock 
controlled registers. The clock control of each register is that 
register's own middle bit, xor'ed with a threshold function of the 
middle bits of all three registers (ie if two or more of the middle 
bits are 1, then invert each of these bits; otherwise just use them 
as they are). The register lengths are 19, 22 and 23, and all the 
feedback polynomials are sparse.

Readers will note that there is a trivial 2^40 attack (guess the 
contents of registers 1 and 2, work out register 3 from the keystream, 
and then step on to check whether the guess was right). 2^40 trial 
encryptions could take weeks on a workstation, but the low gate count 
of the algorithm means that a Xilinx chip can easily be programmed to 
do keysearch, and an A5 cracker might have a few dozen of these 
running at maybe 2 keys per microsecond each. Of course, if all you 
want to do is break the Royal Family's keys for sale to News 
International, then software would do fine.

It is thus clear that A5 should be free of all export controls, just 
like CDMF and the 40-bit versions of RC2 and RC4.

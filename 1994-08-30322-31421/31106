    Okay, let me try to explain those "weasel-words."  There is an
"open" problem in mathematics called P=NP.  (In books explaining the
field of complexity theory, this problem usually ends up about chapter
10.  I'm not going to write such a book here.  If you want to know
more about it, I can recoomend some good books, or good graduate
programs.)  If P=NP, then factoring is (relatively speaking) easy.
Thus if you can prove that factoring is hard, you have proved P/=NP.
However, P/=NP is not a sufficient condition for proving factoring to
be hard, and finding an easy method of factoring would not prove P=NP,
although it would affect mathmeticians opinions on the subject of
whether it is possible.  (One of the worst features of P=NP, is that,
if it is unprovable, you cannot prove that it is unprovable.)

    Mathematicians have been working for hundreds if not thousands of
years on improving the speed of factoring.  There has been a lot of
recent progress, including by Bob Silverman and by some of those
involved in the factoring of RSA-129.  The importance of P=NP has only
been understood in the last 20 years or so, but it may be the most
important unsolved problem in mathematics.

    It is certainly one of the three or four most important.  (Any
mathematicians who want to argue for, say, Goldbach's Conjecture as
more important, please start another thread, and perhaps take it to
sci.math.)

    So ANY improvement in our understanding of factoring and/or P=NP
is not going to come easily.  But without a very huge advance, there
is no way to say (without weasel-words) whether factoring is easy or
hard.  For now, most experts in the field are willing to trust
that PGP and RSA are secure.  (Remember that factoring is easy would
not necessarily mean that P=NP.  But if P=NP, then any public-key
cryptosystem is theoretically equally vulnerable, as are many
non-public key systems.  So if you really are uncomfortable with the
lack of proof, use a one-time pad.)

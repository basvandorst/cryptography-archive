According to "The little book of big primes", by Paulo Ribenboim,
Skewes did indeed use this number as an upper bound on the first
change of sign of Li(x) - pi(x). I quote:

	Assuming Riemann's hypothesis, Skewes showed in 1933 that
	x_0 < 10^(10^(10^34)) [I don't know if it's 43 as above or
	34; 34 is what's in the text. uh]. For a long time, this
	number was famous, as being the largest number that appeared
	in a somewhat natural way in mathematics. One knows now,
	even without assuming Riemann's hypothesis, a much smaller
	upper bound for x_0.

	RECORD

	In a computation reported in 1986, te Riele has showed that
	already between 6.62*10^370 and 6.69*10^370 there are more
	than 10^180 successive integers for which Li(x) < pi(x).

End quote. So there you have it.

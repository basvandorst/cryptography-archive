One-time storage devices are in fact pretty common.
Among the common ones are dynamic RAM's (just leave
out the regenerative sense amp...) and bubble
memories.

The "particle in a box" idea is intriguing ... realistically
one would get a very weak signal from such a device, leading
to a corrupted pad, but enough error-correction coding on
the plaintext should in theory take care of that.

Further, there are "self-destruct" designs, which
are sometimes used for intelligence equipment, as
well as designs that destroy or "zeroize" data upon
tampering.  Finally, E-cells and other time-bombs could
be used to wipe out your key or keystream at a 
set point in time.

The question presents itself of why you would want to 
wipe out your pad upon using it for decryption.  After all, you
now also posess the plaintext -- which is at least as sensitive
as the pad -- and you are faced with the question
of destroying or protecting it.   The pad, and the recovered
plaintext, could be given equal protection and treatment.

Has any research been done in the field of encryption that uses one of 
the many millions of equasions that generate chaos as the algorithmic 
engine for encryption.  If so please e-mail me at 
wimer922@raven.csrv.uidah.edu 
and let me know what research has been pursued in this field.

If not please let me know what you think of the idea, also by e-mail.

Thanx for your time and trouble, you may save me from reinventing the 
wheel. :)

Although some bits may remain, I think you could use a strong electromagnet
adjacent to your disk.  An AC motor field coil comes to mind.

You could also use a long random sequence and xor it with the data
as needed; keep the key on a floppy, and keep a torch near the floppy.

Or keep the key on an eprom with an open UV window, with a tanning 
lamp nearby...

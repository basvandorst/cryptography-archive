At last, an expert.

There has been a lot of screaming and shouting about how RSA could not be
patented in the European Community because it is:

1. a patent on an algorithm;
2. a patent on a computer program;
3. a patent on a mathematical formula.

all of which are asserted not to be patentable in the EU. (I exclude the
prior publication issue which was not the subject of that discussion.)

Associated with that family of discussions has been the assertion by some
that it "should not" have been patentable in the U.S. for the same reasons.

Could you please clarify just what kind of U.S. patent RSA represents? Those
I trust have asserted that it is a "system" or "process" patent rather than
any of the above, and thus would be patentable in the European Community.

Thanks;
David

are told by their pals that they are in the middle of the road. Nothing is
wrong any more (except, of course, conservative thoughts and expressions).

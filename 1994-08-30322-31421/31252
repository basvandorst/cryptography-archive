There you go - if you can't decipher the faq, then you shouldn't be subscribed 
here.  :-)

Actually, if you lurk for a while, you'll see a series of postings that 
identify themselves as being the faq; they're clearly labeled (1 of 10, or 1 of 
3, depending on which faq is posted [we have *2* faqs in sci.crypt] :-).  You 
can think of them as 'chapters' of the same 'book', and simply save them as 
individual files.  The two faqs are the sci.crypt faq, and the RSA faq.

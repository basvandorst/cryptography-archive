>in this group?

The FAQ's for starters, then try checking your local
public/university library.  The latter will usually have some
good stuff, though I found very good intro in my public library.

>How many of you actively break codes (cyphers?) for fun or profit?

I suspect not very many.  The idea that super secret spies and
hackers are actively breaking ciphers is very romantic, but not
very realistic, IMO.  Most of the discussion in this group is
politics, politics, more politics, command line options for pgp,
and a few irrelevant posts about the theoretical security of
a given cipher.  <sigh>

>Is it even feasible for Joe Blow to consider decrypting a modern cypher?

Yes and no.. as one person already said - you can do anything if
you try hard enough.  However, breaking most modern ciphers
requires on of two things - massive computing power for a brute
force or more efficient attack, or massive brain power :) to
design an attack that *doesn't* require massive computing power.

>Are there programs available to help?

Check some crypto archives, there is a program called Crypt
Breakers Workbench for cracking the Unix crypt command I
believe.  However, there is really no such thing as a *general*
cracking program - every ciper is different and each has different
avenues of attacks.

>Is there a FAQ?  A list of books to read, hopefully some that aren't all
>greek? 

The FAQ is in All The Usual Places (ATUP - did I use that
first?!? :)  It is posted here and in news.answers every few
weeks, available for ftp at rtfm.mit.edu and a few other places.
(the FAQ also contains many useful ftp sites).  If you can't
find it or don't have ftp, I can send it to you.

>I read in a help doc (for PGP) that a cypher based on a RNG (like xor

>somebody explain to me in small words how this can be attacked?

Usually the RNG in such a scenario is what is weak - if I can
predict the output of the RNG then I know the keystream and I
can decrypt your message.  It all hinges on the choice of RNG. 
I don't know if I should use RNG here - a REAL random number
generator, i.e. generating random bits from atomic vibrations
etc. used in this scheme is called a one time pad and is
impossible (provably) to break.  However, the key (the random
bits) must be as long as the message, can never be reused and
must be transport securely to the recipient of the encrypted
message - read the FAQ for details.

>The same guy who said the above also said that creating a

>many years ago.  How can it be attacked?

(Most ciphers invented by "noobies" :) are "stolen" simply
because they have already been thought of.  If everyone took a
look around at what has been said and done before claiming
something as their own - *nobody* would be a newbie :)

>Thank you all for indulging me.

No problem - good luck!

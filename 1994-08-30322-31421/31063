M(> The real hard question that comes to mind, for me, is what to do 
if
M(> someone sends source code for a complete encryption application (not just
M(> an algorithm) that is not exportable from the USA.  I think that right
M(> now, I would suggest that the poster just submit a short article to
M(> sci.crypt.moderated that told where the application can be found. If the
M(> poster is outside of the USA, this could be a full posting on the
M(> unmoderated sci.crypt or an open ftp site.  If the poster is inside of
M(> the USA, it might be an "export controlled" site, an offer to mail the
M(> full application to qualified (under the ITAR) recipients, or, if the
M(> poster chooses to take the risk, on an umoderated news group or open ftp
M(> site.  Such long posts as are involved in complete applications are
M(> probably better off in a binaries or sources group, anyway.

All the above suggests to me is that:

1. The moderator should be OUTSIDE the US(, or any other country that 
was part of COCOM?).

2. The host computer were the files/info communicated are retained 
should also be outside the US.

If that is the case, the author in the US automatically takes the risk 
if he/she posts export controlled info/code/source/etc., and no one 
else need be concerned, since IMPORT is not controlled to the same 
extent (yet :-) )

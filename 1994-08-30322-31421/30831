There was also something in American Math Monthly a year or so
ago about figuring out the check digits in US drivers licenses.
The different US states issue their own licenses and they use
a wide variety of algorithms.  The author of the article had
figured out a bunch of them, and described characteristics
of some others that he hadn't completely figured out.

I'd recommend digitizing the amplitude values.  Besides being much easier,
it is not affected by bandwidth in the same way as a pulse width
measurement.

We use noise diodes for random noise generation at the Institute where I
work.  These devices are rf-isolated, and produce a flat average amplitude
response from 100 kHz to 18 GHz.  A typical diode produces 25 dB excess
noise above
kTB.  Paradoxically, we use these noise sources to calibrate RF
measurement equipment.

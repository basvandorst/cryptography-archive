 RZ> P.S: I've feared someone has invented a fast factoriser

Well if someone does, I betcha you won't find out about it.
Money beats fame any day of the week, and if _I_ invented one, I
know where I could sell it (and my silence) for a whole buncha
$$$.

On the positive side, some pretty darned good mathematical minds
have been publically working on this problem for centuries.  It
still appears to be "difficult."  But, remember, it has never
been (publically) _proven_ to be "difficult!"  Insofar as I know
there is not even a proof about the "provability" of this one
way or the other.  (In some rare cases you can prove that
something can/cannot be proven/disproven.  This is called
"showing that it is undecideable.")

However I surmise that if mathematicians all had to place bets
on the bar right now about it, they'd mostly bet that factoring
will remain "difficult."

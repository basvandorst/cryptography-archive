This is an admirable attitude for places where scholars meet, but the
Usenet is not such a place. Demanding excellence on Usenet is silly, and
expecting it sillier.  And that is what makes the Usenet what it is.

Most people that go about learning anything new start from zero; I do not
think they should remain silent until they have reached a level of
excellence. I think it is good that people ask stupid questions. At least
they are showing an interest in trying to learn more.

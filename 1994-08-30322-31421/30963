GP would be just another hill climber that can escape local minima, except
that you can (though most don't) evolve representations as well as
parameters.  Twiddling seeds doesn't let you escape your basic RNG
polynomial; what you need is to evolve a polynomial (or funkier equation) as
well as its initial states.  Of course, this greatly enlarges your
search space.

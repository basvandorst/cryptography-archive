With transposition, one simply computes the standard deviation of
the ciphertext. It'll have essientally the same Sd as plaintext. 
One then starts the computer doing statistics on the occurence of
*pairs* (or triplets even) of characters at various "intervals".

This actually gets the transposition pattern fairly quickly. Multiple
transposition is equivalent to *one* more complex transpostion (one
having N1 * N2 as it's base).

I don't have the programs anymore, but there were some workable ones
published in "Cryptanalysis for Microcomputers" back in 1980. 

BTW, I suggest that you try *decrypting* your simple example. I'm not
certain that the process is "properly" reversible as you have it set
up.

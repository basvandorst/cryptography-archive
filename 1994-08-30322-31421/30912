As a postscript to the preceding posting, note the following:
The two UFMs that occur in each set of the bases for which N is a "weak"
pseudoprime, satisfy the quadratic congruence,
		a^2 = 1 (mod N)
Hence, having an efficient method of solving that congruence is all that it
takes to find one of the UFMs and to factor N. No random search, no exponentia-
tion, just addition and an algorithm to recognize when (1+k*N), k=1,2,3...
is a square.

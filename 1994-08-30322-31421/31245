Boy I would be afraid to try that!  I've snarfed many FAQs out
of many groups: they are usually a series of messages in
sequential order, a doddle to splice together, and I end up with
something to read.

But the FAQ for _this_ group!  I have tried to cryptoanalyze it,
but when after the smoke clears from my editor I have to give
up.  It comes as some series or collection of documents in
pieces in random order: I am not sure if I get all the pieces or
some of them more than once; hard to tell, actually.

Just saw it fly by yesterday, and it was the same weird mess.

If this is some kind of test, I admit I fail.  :-)  Someday I
think I would like to read it, though.

Is there a key or rosetta stone or something that tells how to
assemble the FAQ?  Maybe a "How to make the FAQ FAQ?" :-)

Actually, for this sort of topic, it is fair to ask for 
general opinions as to how safe the method is from a factoring
attack, even if one does not understand the mathematics
of the best currently known factoring attacks.

Most published opinions I have read are weasel-worded, e.g.
"Everybody believes factoring to be very difficult, but
nobody really knows if there isn't some trick that makes it
easy".

I don't think we need to make people jump through hoops
to feel around for opinions on this issue.  It is, after
all, an important one.  Any fixed notion of "basic preliminary
homework" would seem off-base to me, so long as the
discussion is rational and scientific.

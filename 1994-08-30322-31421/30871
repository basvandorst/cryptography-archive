While NNs would not be very useful for the task, Genetic Programming might
offer another hook into breaking some of the more popular public key
systems.  Methods such as RSA are based upon the, yet unproven, assumption
that factoring is a hard problem.  If one had the $$ to throw at the
problem it would seem that the best approach would be to evolve agents
which take a shot at the factoring problem.  If you can find a trapdoor to
factoring the product of large primes then a lot of people are going to be
very interested...

GP and related evolutionary methods are very good at tasks such as this
and given enough CPU power they could possibly make more progress than
human mathematicians...

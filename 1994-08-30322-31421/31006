It may appear that in the preceding note I have re-invented the wheel. Not,
really!. Just consider the case when both of the UFMs are of comparable size.
One can show then that finding one of them is quite simple. We have then,
	a2-a1 = delta
	a1 =(n-delta)/2
Just when such conditions occur is not clear but they do! Here is the inevitable
example:
	N = 253 260 01
	a2=126 686 27
	a1=126 573 74
	delta = 112 53
That value od delta is much smaller than the multiplier k required by the
solution of the quadratic congruence ( k =632 587 5), so that there is some
merit in pursuing this line of reasoning, right?

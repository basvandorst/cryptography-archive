Well I sent a formula to you by email but since you apparently either
did not receive it or read it, here it is
#operations is of order exp(1.9 (L)^(1/3)(ln(L))^(2/3) ) for the "best"
the Number Field Sieve, for large numbers- L is the length in bits I
believe.

So plug in your favourite computer speed and calculate.

If you wish to write a zero and the LSB in the original sample is 0, leave it.
If you wish to write a zero and the LSB in the original sample is 1, add 1.
If you wish to write a one  and the LSB in the original sample is 0, add 1.
If you wish to write a one  and the LSB in the original sample is 1, leave it.

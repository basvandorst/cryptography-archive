:Well I sent a formula to you by email but since you apparently either

:#operations is of order exp(1.9 (L)^(1/3)(ln(L))^(2/3) ) for the "best"

This is incorrect. If L is the length in bits then N ~ 2^L.
The run time is

O((1.9 + o(1)) (log N)^1/3 (log log N)^2/3)

Your forgot the o(1) term [it is important for real problems]
and log(2^L)  does NOT equal L. It equals  L log 2. You are missing
two instances of log2 in your exponent. This is the natural logarithm.

Finally, this is (essentially) a deterministic run time and does
not answer the question about "probability of cracking in time t"
[which is basically gibberish. If t is fixed, then it either is 
or is not sufficient to factor a number of given size. There is no
"probability"]

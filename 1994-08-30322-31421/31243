The problem is not the encryption algorithm itself, the problem is
that the people who use it are....people. Human. You'd be surprised
how easy it is to break people's encryption just by doing a few things
they never expected you to do.

You need to ask one more question in the case of PGP; "How safe is
IDEA" since IDEA is doing the actual encryption. Oh, and PGP DOES do
private key encryption too. Read the docs, they're great. 

(PS : I use PGP 2.3 or something like that...)

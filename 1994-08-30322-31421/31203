  ... goes on to describe a system that asks for some parts of a pass phrase.

  I'm of two opinions on this:
     a) if you really want security above and beyond the account
       security, then use something like s/key for the password.
     b) forget about securing the secret key ring: secure the system.
       If you telnet, then use kerberos encrypted sessions, s/key for
       initial authentication, etc..
     c) have a secure secret key, kept offline, use it to sign a "key
       of the month", and keep that online, and *assume* it will be 
       compromised soon.

  Anything really complex always comes up against:

  Does anyone know if anyone is selling s/key programs for pocket
calculators? (Preferably something cheaper than an HP48SX)

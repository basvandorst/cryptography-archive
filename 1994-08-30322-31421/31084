No sir, I am sorry to differ, but it does not.  The work factor for a
cryptanalytic attack is related to the difficulty of factoring the
modulus.  However, this work factor is so much greater than the
alternative costs of obtaining the data that it is hardly related to the
security.  Rather, the security is a function of many far more mundane
things.  Phil Zimmerman went to great pains to describe these in the
documentation for PGP.  (It may not be a masterpiece, but I wish that I
had written it.)  It is a shame that so few people seem to have read it.

Even NSA, who presumably can break codes cheaper than anybody, prefers to
break knuckles.  They will resort to breaking codes only when they want
there to be doubt as to whether or not they have seen the traffic.

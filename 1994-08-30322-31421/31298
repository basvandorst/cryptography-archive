	You are making an error in your quotation of the basic relation
used to derive the decrypting exponent, d. The correct form is:
	e*d =1 (mod phi(N)) where
	phi(N) = (p-1)*(q-1)
So, for example, if p=3 and q=11 you will have N=33 and phi(N) = 20. Choosing
e that is relatively prime to phi(N), say, e=7 and solving the resulting
indeterminate equation you will get for d=23 or some other congruent number.
If you are interested further in the matter I suggest that you read a very
fine article by M. Hellman in Sci.Am.(1979).

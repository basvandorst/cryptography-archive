VCR codes are sometimes not available and GEMSTAR charges for calls to their
computer phone number which will give them to you. Such phone calls require
the same information the VIP-18M takes anyway.. Sometimes there are
back-to-back programs on the same channel which require several codes, but
one has a full load in one's VCR Plus. Putting such programs in manually can
allow for more pre-loads.

I know of no VCRs (certainly at least not mine) which will change the
channel on my cable box for scrambled programs requiring the box for
decoding (HBO, etc.). That was one original inspiration behind the VCR+--you
could set it up in advance to record programs on different scrambled cable
channels, which would remain scrambled if you used the VCR's own tuner to
switch back and forth. The VCR+, in contrast, sends an infra-red signal to
turn on the cable box and switch channels along with the signal to turn on
the VCR and start it recording (in one common set-up of the VCR Plus).

If you don't have cable, then it is still advantageous to use the VCR Plus
since the codes know the length of programs (such as movies) whose exact
lengths cannot be determined from the program guides. This is especially
important for channels which precede each movie with commentary or show
"edited for TV" versions for which the code is correct but the TV guide not.

As long as you're using it that way, it's better to include the manually set
recording in the VCR+ since if you did those in the VCR, you then have to
turn it off on "time record" mode and it will not respond to VCR+ codes.
That prevents you from batch recording both known code programs and unknown
code programs if you put the latter in your VCR.

Trust me, the guy who developed the VCR+ is brilliant. He was a new Cal Tech
graduate at the time, knew exactly what he was doing technologically, and
deserves all the riches I hope he's getting. Consider only the chicken and
egg problem of getting papers to carry codes for devices with low market
penetration intially, or getting people to buy devices before the codes were
near-universally available (TV Guide was a laggard in carrying them).
Consider the sophisticated encryption of the codes. Consider the challenge
of mass production of an unknown device whose chip was probably about as
complicated as Clipper, that could be marketed at high-volume target price
points. The guy got the country to buy his vision using nothing more than
the free market, and transformed the way a segment operates, and my hat's
off to him. I hope he got a lot of money out before the thing becomes
(became) a mature industry.

By the way, I've talked to him, since the company is local here in Pasadena.
He's a young Chinese fellow--perhaps that helped him in setting up
high-quality, low cost mass production of the device in China.

A word to the wise. There's a newer model which includes a universal remote
control, and which does not contain the facility to put in your own program
info without codes. In a conversation with a sales rep of the company, I was
told that they were heavily downplaying that feature of the VIP-18M
mentioned above, for the reasons I stated. It may be that it is now a
discontinued model and the third one is the current model. If so, get an 18M
while you can--as I say, Sharper Image is selling them at about half the
price at which they originally came out. Make sure it's the one pictured in
the newest Catalog (which I got in the mail last week)  with "Call Set" which
is model VIP-18M.

I have recently been informed that "my posting on the RFC citation summary
for revision of the Secure Hash Algorithm (comp.security.misc)
contained 530 blank lines at the end of the message!!!".

Sorry about that, I apologize.

This did not show up on my newsreader.
I posted in a hurry, via an old Multics machine, where the
document was sitting, and had to use an unfamiliar version
of Emacs, which may have added the blank lines.
I have reposted the "SHA Proposed Modification" without the
blank lines.

Many software developers and computer scientists have been
calling up NIST since April 22, 1994 about the "technical
correction to the Secure Hash Standard" and have been
getting no response, as has been reported on the newsgroups.
Not many computer people read or have access to the
"Federal Register", especially in the summertime.
The SHA is of reduced security without the fix.
There is a deadline for receipt of comments.

While i knew that the posting might have errors,
I felt that it was important to get the "SHA Proposed
Modification" on the Net as soon as possible.

Instead of sending me e-mail, which i dont mind by the way,
complaining about 530 blank lines at the end of the message.
A more constructive activity would be contacting either:

Lynn McNulty, Associate Director Computer Security
or
Ann Enright Shepherd, Public Realtions

United States Department of Commerce
National Institute of Standards and Technology
Computer System Laboratory
Gaithersburg, Maryland   20899-0001

And request that NIST improve their procedures
in releasing technical corrections to standards.
Such as, putting the information on their Gopher Site,
or releasing it on the Net, as soon as it becomes available.


P.S. NIST has always been very helpfull to me, and other
     computer scientists. I believe that this was a very
     unusual situation.


Thank You    \\//    :-)

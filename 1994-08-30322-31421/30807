Clipper does not include any key exchange protocol.  Maybe you are
thinking of Capstone.  If the conversing parties used Clipper with
a prearranged shared secret key, the MITM couldn't hear the unencrypted
voice without getting one of the Clipper unit keys somehow.

The only commercial encrypted phone I've seen, a prototype AT&T 3600, used
authenticated key exchange with non-Clipper encryption.  I heard that
a Clipperized version was in the works.  Presumably that model will/would
also have authentication.

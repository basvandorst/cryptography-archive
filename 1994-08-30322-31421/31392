That's a very interesting idea... But why only one round? I have the
vague impression that it would be insufficient. I'd use at least 3
rounds.

However, if I recall correctly, it has been proven the existence of
configurations that are "germs", i.e., that cannot appear by applying
the rules to any other initial configuration... Not sure whether this
is relevant to the application we are discussing, though.

Also, what would be the chances of the initial configurations to
"disappear" after one (or more) round(s), or at least to leave a
configuration with too many emplty cells? This would lead to insecure
keys...

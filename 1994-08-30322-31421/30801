It is very laborious trial and error. I gave up when GEMSTAR came out with a
VCR Plus model that also allows one to enter start, duration, date, and
channel info directly, without the need for the Plus codes. They've kept
this pretty quiet, because they don't want to spoil the VCR code publication
business, but Model VIP-18M (with Call Set) has this feature. It's not
mentioned on the packaging, but under the cover is a button called "Alter"
that does the deed, in connection with subsequent "Enter"'s. Sharper Image
has these on sale at a very good price right now.

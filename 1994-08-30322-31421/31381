I doubt very much the UK has a law that explicitly bans encryption.
Some places to look could be:
1 -- The Official Secrets Act (going equipped for espionage??)
2 -- BABT regs. There may be rules about what one can send down a phone
     line.
3 -- Export regulations. Do the UK regs copy ITAR? 

Anyone have these references?

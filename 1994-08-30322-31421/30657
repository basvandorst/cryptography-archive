Let's analyze your statement that:  "national security to one nation is
national insecurity to another".  This is absolutely true, no argument here.  If
all the countries of the world were capitalist democracies with the
recognition of individual rights codified in their constitutions, national
security would be a non-issue.  But there are self-sworn enemies of our
respective countries at large in the world, and I choose not to sacrifice one
iota of my country's security so a usenet group can have an "international"
flavor.  I like secure borders and a high standard of living.  I also play poker with
my cards face down.

Insert any nation you wish into "national security"--the risk remains the same. 
Risk goes with this territory.  How each of us deals with it is clear.

M. Blase really wrote it; he even has a paper describing it. Among
other things, as any big company, AT&T has *research* centers, where
*researchers* like M. Blase are paid to do *research*. The outcome of
the research is not always predictable and migth not satisfy all
governments at any given moment. I suspect the NSA didn't like much
him discovering the way to bypass the escrow in Clipper either.

Bet it. The source is available, so any competent cryptographer in the
USA is able to inspect it and look for security holes. S/he can even
fix them if s/he finds any.

1) Get a clue.

2) Learn to spell.

3) AT&T does not produce Clipper and is not behind it. Mykotronix
produces it and the NSA is behind it. The whole fault of AT&T in this
story is that they want to make bucks by selling phones with the
Clipper chip in them.

4) Get a clue.

5) Go back to alt.2600 or alt.conspiracy, where you obviously came
from.

> Why is are these few so fast to defend this? 

Because there are a few intelligent people, who can't stand your
ignorant nonsense being spit on the net.

> Who do they work for?

I, in particular, work for the Virus Test Center, University of
Hamburg, Germany. Also, I am a Bulgarian citizen, supporter of PGP and
any kind of strong crypto that is made freely available. I am opposing
the Clipper project too, because I think that it is a step toward
establishing a totalitarian regime in a free country.

Because it is export-restricted from the USA, you silly! If they were
giving it to anybody calling from an anonymous server, who would they
make sure that this "anybody" is not from abroad? Besides, just
sending it to the server would be breaking the (stupid) law, because
the server is in Finnland - therefore, the program would be exported.
Stop hiding your cluelessness behind an anonymous handle, send them a
message from a real address that is verifiably in the USA, and you'll
get it.

If, after that, you decide to break the law and export it (risking 41
to 51 months of jailtime, but it should be expected somebody as
clueless as you to do such a thing), then there are many sites outside
the USA (including ours), that would accept to carry it.

> This was over six months ago, in february.  Has anyone actually received this code? 

I'm sure that many people in the USA can respond affirmatively to this
question of yours.

> I'll stick with PGP: version 2.3.

1) PGP is a file encryption program - not a file encryption system
like CFS.

2) PGP version 2.3 has a bug, which makes it fail to verify correctly
some clearsigned messages. You need to upgrade at least to 2.3a. And,
if you want to continue to be able to communicate with all PGP users
around the world even after September 1, you'll need to upgrade to PGP
2.6 or PGP 2.6ui.

In short - get a clue, you need it badly.

Regards,
Vesselin

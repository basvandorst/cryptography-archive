Naw, the cosmologists can't hold a candle to us! A "big number" to
them is 10^10, as in the age of the universe, or 10^73, as in the
total number of particles in the universe.

We routinely deal with 300-digit numbers. Not too many of those crop
up in the physical universe.

They're just pikers compared to us.

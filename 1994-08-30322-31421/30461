JA>>Frequency of letters (%, not just ordering);
JA>>Frequency of initial letters (ditto);
JA>>Frequency of terminal letters (ditto again);
JA>>Frequency of most common digraphs.

JA>    "Cryptanalysis" by Helen Fouche Gaines (available from

JA>    over the years and with the subject matter. [...]

   While the Gaines book is a classic and I wouldn't part with my copy
for anything, it should be noted that only the first and last items on
the wish-list actually appear (and digram frequencies only in English).
For initial/final letters you get only order (and a choice of results
from two researchers, to boot).
Cheers...

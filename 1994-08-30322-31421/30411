Just because Penknife produces network-ASCII ciphertext as part of the
algorithm doesn't mean that other cryptosystems such as PGP need to
consider the 8-to-6 conversion as part of the algorithm.  Different
designers can make use of 8-to-6 conversions to different degrees.
Penknife uses it as part of the encryption, while PGP considers it a means
to media compatibility.  What's wrong with this difference?

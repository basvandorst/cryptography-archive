Good question.  Unfortunately, I haven't been keeping track of exact 
articles.  I probably wouldn't have passed my own posting about Phil 
Zimmermann's debate to sci.crypt.research (actually, it was Phil's, I 
just relayed it).  Even so, I set follow ups to talk.politics.crypto on 
that one.  sci.crypt.research is supposed to be for discussions of the 
art, mathematics, and science of cryptography.  This includes algorithms, 
protocols, basic math such as factoring, methods of generating truly 
random and psuedorandom numbers, etc.  Discussions of politics (of the 
USA, France, or wherever), including export controls, the wisdom of EES 
(or lack thereof, as opposed to the technology of EES), are better off in 
talk.politics.crypto, alt.clipper, or alt.privacy.  Flames and personal 
attacks should be sent to /dev/null or alt.flame.  Discussions pertaining 
purely to the implementations of RIPEM or PGP that have little to do with 
the techical aspects of cryptography might better be sent to 
alt.security.ripem, alt.security.pgp, or possibly the unmoderated 
sci.crypt for packages with no dedicated group.

It would probably be good for all of the moderators to agree on a form
letter for rejects containing such information.

In case of doubt, I would probably just approve the post and see if 
anyone objects.

The real hard question that comes to mind, for me, is what to do if 
someone sends source code for a complete encryption application (not just 
an algorithm) that is not exportable from the USA.  I think that right 
now, I would suggest that the poster just submit a short article to 
sci.crypt.moderated that told where the application can be found. If the 
poster is outside of the USA, this could be a full posting on the 
unmoderated sci.crypt or an open ftp site.  If the poster is inside of 
the USA, it might be an "export controlled" site, an offer to mail the 
full application to qualified (under the ITAR) recipients, or, if the 
poster chooses to take the risk, on an umoderated news group or open ftp 
site.  Such long posts as are involved in complete applications are 
probably better off in a binaries or sources group, anyway.

As far as code fragments to implement an isolated algorithm, or perhaps a 
complete one-time-pad program, I see no problem with these.  After all, 
if anyone doesn't know how a one time pad works, they can probably read 
it in someone's tag line.  How short of a one time pad program can you 
write in C?

Adding sci.crypt.research shouldn't take anything away -- it just adds a 
place where people who don't care to wade through so much noise can hold 
a more focused conversation on the technical aspects of cryptography.

I hope this helps...

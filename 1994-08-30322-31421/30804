Maybe from a marginal point of view. Magic squares have some links with latin
squares, and in my opinion, latin squares are the unavoidable tool for the
design of dedicated cryptographic primitives.

More precisely, latin squares and quasigroup law are almost the same thing
(they differ as the same as matrix and linear mappings). A finite set have a
quasigroup law iff it is bi-regular i.e. for all x,y,z (x.y=x.z ==> y=z) and
(x.y=z.y ==> x=z). From a cryptographic point of view, this property performs
"perfect diffusion": if only one input is changed, both output are changed.

Quasigroups play an important role in the design of IDEA cypher (see Lai's
thesis pages 25 and more). They are also basic in two papers of Schnorr and
I:

C.-P. Schnorr, S. Vaudenay.
Parallel FFT-Hashing.
In Fast Software Encryption, Cambridge Security Workshop (UK).
pp 149--156. Lecture Notes in Computer Science No. 809, Springer-Verlag, 1994.

C.-P. Schnorr, S. Vaudenay.
Black box cryptanalysis of hash networks.
To appear in the proceedings of EUROCRYPT'94.

I regret there is no (up to my knowledge) paper dedicated to the use of latin
squares in cryptography.

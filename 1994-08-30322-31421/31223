   Call the multiple of lambda(n) k.  Pick some number a and calculate
x = a^(2^k).  If x is not equal to a or n-a, then GCD(x-a,n) = p or q.
Repeat as necessary, with probability approximately 1/2 that any step
will succeed, and an average expectation of two tries required.

   (Effectively you are finding two roots of a^2.  It helps to look at
the Chinese Remainder Theorem representation of a and x to see why
this works.)

   That help?

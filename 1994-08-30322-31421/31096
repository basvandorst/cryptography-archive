  I wanted to ask for some help with finding the right book(s) about 
cryptography for a beginner.  Since I will be covering cryptography in my 
science fair project this winter (where are the times when high school 
kids talked about how beans grow or continents move at the science fair? 
;), I would like to find some resources (especially on public-key 
methods, RSA, etc.) that would not be hard to obtain (sorry, no access to 
any university library), and also the mathematics would be explained in 
some easier-to-digest way.  All help will be highly appreciated.

Regards,
Robert

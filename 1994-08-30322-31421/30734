Meed some advice:
I have developed a copy protection device (dongle) based on a
cryptographic algorithm.  It is based on a DES modification.  The
protected program picks a 64 bit random number, sends it to the
device and receives an encrypted response to be checked by the
protected program.  The device also have a read protected zone that
is accessible by the software for reading encrypted information and
decrypt and used inside the protected software. The device is fully
operational now and it is manufactured in Israel. What bothers me is
the export license from the U.S. The software manufacturer might
export his software protected with my device. This device is a
cryptographic device, and the protected software uses routines for
decryption.  I know the subject of export license was discussed in
this conference in the past.  Can anyone advice about the following?

1. Dose an encryption device and software manufactured outside of the
   U.S and impored in, need any export license?
2. Are devices that do one way functions based on cryptographic algorith
   (RABIN's hashing function in my case) included in this category?

No, there are residual traces at the "fringes" of the magnetic
domains that are still readable.  There is some variance in
the positioning of the write head.  Overwriting your data once
is good enough if the advesary is going to use the normal means
of reading your disk, but if they are willing to spend the money
they can look for old, overwritten data.  Of course, there is
a limit to what can be done, so overwriting with random data a
few dozen times should obscure the data in most cases.

We've seen examples of programs (a la CRACK) which will take given
input files (dictionaries) and attempt to break passwords... but I've
yet to see a program which will actually attempt to crack the DES
encryption itself.

Are there some available for FTP?  

(respond via email and I will summarize if there's interest)

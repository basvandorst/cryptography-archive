That question isn't really possible to answer because, going from my experience
with comp.compression{.research}, most of the material posted to the
non-moderated group is never posted to the moderated one because people know
that it isn't suitable.  So saying "what would be the rejection rate for
postings to group A if they were suddenly all posted to group B" isn't a valid
question.
 
Going from the compression groups (which, incidentally, have only a fraction of
the bandwidth of sci.crypt, and much of that seems to be Zip and Stacker-
related), I'd say that most of the submissions would be accepted.  I only
reject blatant FAQ's by sending a pointer to the FAQ, and as a rule of thumb
tend to post messages posted to both groups to the unmoderated one only,
because they're usually from people posting to anything with "compression" in
the name in order to get maximum coverage.
 
Peter.

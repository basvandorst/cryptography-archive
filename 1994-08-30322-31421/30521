I'm not a lawyer, much less a trademark lawyer (I'm a patent examiner 
with the US Patent & Trademark Office), so obviously this isn't legal 
advice, nor does it necessarily represent the official position of the 
USPTO.

But I think you're confusing things a bit here. Noun v.s. Adjective isn't 
the right distinction. The distinction is whether the term in question 
designates the source of the item, or the item itself. In other words, if 
PGP were regarded as the generic name for any program that used this 
encryption method, then it would not serve as a trademark. However, if 
PGP does not refer in general to such encryption software, but rather 
refers to software _from Zimmerman_, then it would serve a trademark 
function.

It isn't "adjective v.s. noun", but whether the expression is the generic 
name of the product or whether it instead designates not the product 
itself but the _source_ of the product, which matters.

: Also, a TM must be registered vs a copyright which does not.  
: Just attaching the letter TM does create a trademark.

There are "common law" and state law trademarks, at least in the US. 
Trademarks do _not_ have to be registered with the USPTO, although there 
are obviously additional benefits in so doing.

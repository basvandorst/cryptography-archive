Unless you have lots of $ for custom chips, you're probably out of luck.
Crypt(3), the pasword-encryption function, uses a slightly modified DES.
Slightly modified deliberately so that you can't crack passwords with
standard DES hardware. There is a public-domain and very fast crypt(3)
called ufc-crypt. It is usually used with Crack, as Crack is way too
slow without it. Running Crack and ufc-crypt on a fast PC with Linux would
give you more power than any hardware you could easily build.

This is the place.  Some crypto source-code we've seen has been harder
to decipher than its output, so include a text description of what
your algorithm does and why.  Tell what ideas you think are original,
and how you selected among different design options and parameter
choices.

Do include the source, since most English descriptions we've seen have
been under-specified in important areas.  Sample encrypted text is
just about useless.

I don't know how much experience you have, but be clear about what is
a result and what is a conjecture.  Be humble.  Invite criticism.

You'll probably get flamed anyway.  Don't worry about it.

No one has gotten into trouble for posting code here.  Some recommend
that people refrain from posting complete cryptographic products until
we find out more about the Zimmerman case.  Encryption routines get
posted all the time with no problem.

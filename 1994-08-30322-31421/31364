A(> Date: 25 Aug 1994 13:51:22 GMT
A(> I was very glade finding some people knowing things like DES and 
IDEA.
A(> May anyone of you tell me the stucture of an DES-Algo. or describe me the
A(> math.-way of an DES-Encrytion?
A(> I really plan to construct a hardware 'cracking' just one PW (not a whole
A(> file) in about - let's say - 2 weeks. This hardware should do the same as
A(> a normal Crack, but the will be more CPU's ever seen in a computer (in most
A(> computers).
A(> Here's the problem: planning such a computer needs the knowledge of DES-
A(> Encryption to program the software in assembler to compute the problem on
A(> more than one CPU.
A(> If someone can help me, please do `R'eply to:

Just get a copy of the FIPS publication that defines DES. It is a 
public and published document, and should be available in a library 
somewhere in Germany.

Ya know, the amazing feats of cryptanalysis that impress me the most
are  breaking a book cipher.

How do you think it's done? Lots of manual searching through books?
This must be the brute force method.

If the "book" was a file on a computer, couldomething more efficient
than brute force be done? What would it be? Any ideas? I'm completely
at a loss.

Cheers.

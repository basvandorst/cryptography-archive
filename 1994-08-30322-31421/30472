Good idea, and the solution is already known: to make a system that will
let your diary be read 50 years hence, use an RSA key with a bit length
that should be factorable by anyone's tv set by then.  Simply let
Moore's law be the physical process that requires time to elapse.

Flaws include tech. breakthroughs and concerted efforts of teams, as
in the RSA-129 crack.

I propose calling these "Packwood" schemes...

That is strange, the PGP docs are quite explicit about this, referencing
patent numbers and the full address and tel.nr. of the contact person at
Ascom. Maybe they meant they didn't give permission to use IDEA in a
commercial version of PGP? (Which is something else than a freeware PGP
that is used for commercial purposes).

I recall that Viacrypt bought a license for IDEA to sell PGP - so that
would be consistent with the fact that PGP can't be sold because of the
IDEA patent/license.

(But again... I'm not sure. I only know what I know from the PGP docs!)

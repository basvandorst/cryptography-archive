A few days ago I had some spare time and did some additional
work on the algorithm -- it's actually quite a bit more interesting
than I had originally realized.  While I'm still not confident
of it's security, the tests I did seem fine.  The interleaving
of the step using modulo-2^32 multiplication with the CRC-based
LFSRs seems like a reasonable design decision and should produce
a reasonably good statistics.  I still need to make sure there
aren't biases in the output introduced by the second (multiplicative)
round; if there are any, it'll probably be breakable.  Otherwise
breaking it would probably require finding some interaction between
the reduction in GF 2 in the CRC steps and the multiplicative step.
It may well be possible, though that doesn't seem trivial.

Last Wednesday I spent an hour or so going over the algorithm 
for Whit Diffie and some of the other folks who come to the
Stanford crypto seminars (though unfortunately Dr. Hellman 
didn't make it).  Whit seemed particularly interested  in 
the algorithm as a nice real-world LFSR-based algorithm 
for cryptanalytic attack.  While I don't know whether he or 
anyone else will have time to work on it, I'll try to keep 
the net up-to-date if there are any interesting developments.

Cheers,
Paul Kocher

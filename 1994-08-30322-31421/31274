Some examples:

1. Problem: COMPOSITE
   Instance: a natural number n
   Question: is n composite
   Status: known to be NP.  Not sure whether in P.

2. Problem: RESTRICTED COMPOSITE
   Instance: a natural number n which is smaller than 10
   Question: is n composite
   Status: P.  O(10) = O(1) algorithms exists to answer the question

3. Problem: SAT
   Status: NP-complete

4. Problem: 3SAT, which is like SAT but each clause has 3 or fewer 
   literals
   Status: NP-complete

5. Problem: 2SAT, which is like SAT but each clause has 2 or fewer
   literals
   Status: P

I refer to Garey & Johnson, _Computers and Intractability_, section 
4.1 (pp 80) for a discussion of the interesting phenomenon that even 
though a problem in its most general form is NP-complete, once we 
impose some "practical restriction" things can change significantly.

On the other hand I don't discourage you from studying, say, why 3SAT 
is NP-complete and 2SAT is P, i.e. how 3SAT and 2SAT are (un)related 
so that they are on the two sides of the bordor.  Deep insights on 
this may shed light on the NP vs P issue.  Wish you every success.

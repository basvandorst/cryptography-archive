Funny thing ... I just looked up the same information 
in "Handbook of Mathematical Functions" last night. :)

So, does this mean that, on top of all the other various
assumptions, the security of RSA depends on the Reimann 
Hypothesis being true?

That is to say, if li(n) - pi is of order greater than
sqrt(n) * ln(n), then there could be fewer primes
then we believe for a given RSA-key range, making it
more vulnerable to prime-search attacks than we surmise.

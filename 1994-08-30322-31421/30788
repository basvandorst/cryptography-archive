[Misstatement of the discussion to date omitted.]

The actual discussion was started by a claim that crypto such as RSA could
not be patented in Europe. I suggested that it could, and pointed to IDEA.
That was followed by a lot of nonsense, changes of subject, and outright
flames by several. I suggested the simple test (since it never pays to argue
about facts) of seeing if IDEA was patented in Europe (there had been a lot
of excuses about maybe only a Swiss patent, Switzerland not being part of
the EU, etc.).

This was followed by more flames, nonsense, and people generally making
fools of themselves by trying to argue about facts, apparently to
demonstrate how smart they are.

Finally, someone on the scene took the trouble to check, and posted the EU
patent number for IDEA.

As far as I am concerned:

1. Those who attacked my comments have since shown themselves to be
graceless boors by failing to acknowledge they were wrong;

2. Further posts to try to prove that black is white--i.e. that one really
was arguing about something else, and the IDEA patent is irrelevant, will be
worth only derisive laughter from one's colleagues here.

Several people replied to me in private e-mail in a similar way
(thanks!), which makes me think that I have not expressed myself
clearly enough. And indeed, after re-reading my post I see that I have
written exactly the opposite of what I meant. :-(

In short, I was reasoning in the following way: Suppose that somebody
succeeds to *prove* that P /= NP. Does this mean that factoring is
easy or difficult? Nobody knows, because factoring has not beem proven
to be in NP. Second, suppose that somebody succeeds to *prove* that
factoring is hard. Does this mean that RSA is safe or not? Nobody
knows, because breaking RSA has not been proven to be equivalent to
factoring (but fortunately, there are other public-key cryptosystems
for which this has been proven).

Also, a few people noted that if factoring is in P, it will be "very
unlikely" for it to be proportional to a polynomial of a high degree,
because most problems that can be solved in polynomial time usually
can be solved by algorithms that take at most O(N^3) time. This might
well be true; what I meant was that *if* factoring was in P, then it
requiring time proportional to a polynomial of a high degree would
explain why nobody has found a "fast" algorithms for such a long
time...

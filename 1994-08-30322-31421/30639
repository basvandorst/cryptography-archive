I usually test them by simulating whatever application the
generator will be used in, and then comparing the resulting
performance to that which is theoretically predicted.

It is difficult to predict which statistical tests are
significant to a given application.  e.g., if we
are testing the effects of random noise on a modem, which
test do we use?  The answer depends on the design of
the modem, and rather than trying to figure out which
tests are best, it is easier to simply simulate the effect
on the modem itself.

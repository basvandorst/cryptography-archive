The claim that they are equivalent led me to send this question to B. 
Schneier...

Dear Mr. Schneier,

RE: Applied Cryptography

Page 288:

Knowledge of one encryption/decryption pair of exponents for a given
modulus enables one to factor he modulus.

I assume you mean a pair (e,d) where encryption of a message x as m with
m=x^e mod n permits decrypting by m^d=x mod n.

Consider the following: Find n=pq (p,q primes)... take a prime number
about the size of n, say A... take e relatively prime to A(p-1)(q-1)
(and small... who cares)... find d so that de-1 is divisible by
A(p-1)(q-1) (OK... it is NOT the smallest d which works... its size is
on the order of.. maybe n^2... it still is feasible to use this to
code/decode... for n^2 only has twice the number of bits that n has).

Suppose an interceptor finds that "d" decodes every message (it will).
Suppose in fact that ed-1 is actually equal to A(p-1)(q-1).

OK... he knows the public key (e,n) and found (somehow) a d that works
(it is not unique... and this one is very large)... calculates ed-1
(equal to or maybe just a multiple of A(p-1)(q-1)).

Are you telling me someone who knows n=pq and A(p-1)(q-1) for some large
A can find p,q easily (that is, factor n)?

Of course, IF an interceptor HAPPENS to come up with a d for which ed-1
equals (or is a small multiple of) (p-1)(q-1) then he/she can get
(p-1)(q-1) and knowing n=pq can use the quadratic formula to get p,q and
so factor n, BUT IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE TO USE ANOTHER d WHICH IS SMALL
ENOUGH TO MAKE IT PRACTICABLE AND HAVE ed-1 A LARGE MULTIPLE OF
(p-1)(q-1) (say A(p-1)(q-1)). Will one have to factor this large number
(to find (p-1)(q-1)) in order to factor n? Does that mean that finding a
decrypting exponent that works (NOT one that has ed-1 a small multiple
of (p-1)(q-1)) NOT factor n?

Further... what happens if ed-1 is NOT divisible by (p-1)(q-1) but ONLY
by (say it equals) Least_Common_Multiple(p-1,q-1)... knowing only the
LCM(p-1,q-1) and pq, does this permit one to factor n (find p,q) when
the Greatest_Common_Divisor might be as large, say as the fourth root of
n? (if p-1=xy,q-1=xz where x is the GCD and x,y,z are on the order of
the fourth root of n, n is on the order of xyxz... just right) (ed-1
need only be divisible by the LCM(p-1,q-1), NOT (p-1)(q-1))

In short... is the statement that finding a "d" that works (and is
practical) permits factoring of n (practically) correct or not?

(NOTE: IF n is permitted to have more than two prime factors, but has no
square factors, one can still get RSA to work... but then, finding d is
NOT equivalent to factoring... partial factoring -not complete- permits
one to find a d to decode.. for example, take n=pq where p is prime, q
is relatively prime to p and is a Carmichael composite... then just
knowing the partial factorization n=pq WITHOUT FACTORING q permits one
to use d with ed-1 divisible by (p-1)(q-1) to decrypt)

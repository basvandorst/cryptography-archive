I hope this is the right group for this.

Does anybody have a list of available secure SPOMs?  I know there is a
derivative of 68hcxx11 microcontroller, is there anything else out
there?

Background: secure SPOMs are one way of ensuring hardware security in
encryption systems.  The secret key as well as the algorithm to
encrypt/decrypt messages are programmed on the SPOM.  Once the
programming is done, some fuse is blown (or some other process) to
ensure that the secret key and the program cannot be
accessed/duplicated.  The only operations available to the rest of the
system is to request encryption/decryption services of the CPU.

A related question: is there any other way to achieve the same result.

Any help will be appreciated.

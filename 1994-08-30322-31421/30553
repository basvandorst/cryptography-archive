Because the most interesting uses of cryptography involve protecting your
rights in the elctronic community. E-cash and authentication are just part
of the full range of possibilities. But to do things on the net, you need
to distribute things through the net, and the net crosses the US border.
The US ban doesn't hurt foreign governments at all. The only possible
benefit of it is that it slows the advance of cryptography in the US thus
giving the Clinton administrationa leg up in implementing its cryptographic
policy and making it easy for law enforcement to spot people with something
to hide by the fact that they use crypto.

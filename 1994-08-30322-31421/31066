Clarifications requested:

While I generally agree with the above statement by David, I have to 
wonder about the following, which just happen to apply in my case...

Is a US citizen who is NOT in the US culpable for export of crypto if 
exporting legally from the country HE/SHE is in at the time? Assume 
that the US citizen has been resident in that other country for at 
least 25 years. (Canada deals with Cuba, the US doesn't - and there 
is legal Canadian crypto which does NOT have a US origin, for example)

If a US citizen is a legal resident of another country, which 
submission site would he use?

If a US citizen were resident in another country which did have export 
controls similar to those of the US, could he/she even use a US 
submission site?

While the suggestion, on its face, is simple and concise, there are 
issues that need clarification.  You can replace US citizen with any 
other country which has export controls and the clarifications are 
still required.

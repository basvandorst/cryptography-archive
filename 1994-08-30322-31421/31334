Oh!  I read it as:

A 128 digit key has been broken using the Internet, and anyone
interested in taking part [painted themselves purple for the day].

Now I am finally enlightened as to what it meant.  The comma made it
ungrammatical.  People seem to consider punctuation the cress garnish
of English writing, but it can significantly change meaning, or even
turn sentences into gibberish.

TREASURE

A MAGICAL, BRAIN-TEASING JOURNEY THROUGH MIDDLE ENGLAND
IN PURSUIT OF A FABULOUS FORTUNE

Devised, written and illustrated be Dan James

Middle England is the place
A fortune is the prize
Join Tallifer your minstrel guide
To find out where it lies...

Somewhere in Britain a glittering treasure lies hidden - waiting
to be discovered by anyone with the ingenuity, determination and
patiece to seek it out.

Tallifer, minstrel and close confidant of William the Conqueror,
is reduced to ghostly status by a mortal wound at the Battle of
Hastings. Prior to his death he made a scret expedition to the
five counties of Middle England, concealing treasure along the
way. Under the obligation to fulfil a vow to his lord and master,
he attempts to retrace his steps to find the treasure and, like
the reader, discovers that this is no ordinary task.

There are over forty intriguing clues to be solved in this
exciting historical fantasy, with a gripping narrative and highly
detailed, intricate pictures. A complete solution reveals the
location of the treasure itself, but solving individual clues
brings its own rewards.

Devised by Dan James, a skilful puzzle-master, artist and writer,
and founder of the Armchair Treasure Hunt Club, this enthralling
game takes place across five counties, in some of Britain's most
beautiful countryside.

It promises to be a treasure hunt on an unparalleled scale, with
more clues and substantial prizes than have been offered in
previous publications of this kind, and puzzles that can be
solved by amateur and expert treasure hunters alike.

This an interesting argument.  By law a TM must be an adjective.
This is why the noun coke cannot be trademarked and the adjective
Coke (tm) can be.  Many trademarks have been voided because of
this requirement.  Once the general public accepts the trademarked 
adjective as a noun, it fails to meet the trademark laws.  An example
of this is nylon, which was a trademark of DuPont.

If PGP is a trademark then it must be written something like 
PGP (tm) Software or PGP (tm) Encryption Software.  Notice in
both cases the letters PGP are used as an adjective. 

Also, a TM must be registered vs a copyright which does not.  
Just attaching the letter TM does create a trademark.

I do not recall all of the interstate commerce requirement part of
the trademark law so I will not comment on it.

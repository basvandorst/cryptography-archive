   Okay, after reading the article on the RSA129 crack,
   I would like to know what the group or the leader of that effort 
   feels is now needed to break military grade RSA based their 
   experiment.

Well, I was one of the coordinators (wouldn't call myself a
"leader") of the RSA-129 project.  I am assuming that you mean
1024 bits as "military grade" (please correct me if I am wrong).

   After all the real prize lies in breaking the military grade code
   which is > 10^15 times larger and a whole new ballgame.

Larger?  Hmm, maybe, maybe not.  If we are talking about a 1024 bit
number, using the GNFS factoring algorithm (which is _not_ what was
used for RSA-129), it is approximately 3E5 times harder than factoring
a 512 bit number.  So, if you could only get as much hardware as was
used in the RSA-129 project, it would take you about 300000 years to
factor a 1024 bit number.  RSA-129 had 1600 machines for 8 months, and
a guestimate total of 5000 MIPS-years.  You do the math :-)

   Yes I know that breaking RSA may not require factoring, but keep 
   this thread pure to the factoring idea.

This is true, but let's assume factoring; it is the best known attack.

   Will the information superhighway ever be safe if anyone
   could break such numbers, no...

Yes, I would think it would be safe.  Currently, the cryptographer has
the advantage of the cryptanalyst.  You can easily increase the size
of an RSA key, which only moderately increases the time to use the
key, but greatly affects the time to factor.  However, if major
breakthroughs are made in factoring, then this the assumptions of RSA
will not be met, and all bets are off.

Hope this helps

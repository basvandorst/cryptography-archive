Strictly speaking what you say is true (and you need 2N consecutive
bits) with two (important) conditions:

	1. The shift register must be _linear_, i.e., the feedback
	bit must be an XOR of some fixed subset of the current bits
	of the shift register.

	2. It is good to have access to the pure spreading sequence 
	_unmodulated by data_, you see, sometimes one period
	of the spreading sequence spans more than one data bit
	and this causes inversions.  

Of course, these two problems are trivial in a crypto sense. If it
is right that they're using m-sequences (maximal length sequences)
in these cordless phones, yes m-sequences are linear hence
satisfy condition 1.

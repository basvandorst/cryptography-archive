I suggest you do a little arithmetic. Try comparing li(n) with
the error term sqrt(n) log(n) for (say) 256-bit n.


 
Let me try to inject some FACTS into all this misinformation.

(1) The Riemann Hypothesis does NOT imply that pi(N) is approximated by
li(N).  Pi(n) *is* approximated by li(N). This is a THEOREM known as the
Prime Number Theorem. It does not depend upon RH. The theorem does depend
on the fact that the zeta function has no zeros on the line Real(z) = 1,
but that is not RH.

    What RH does give is better ERROR BOUNDS for the approximation.
    RH would imply that  pi(x) = li(x) + O(sqrt(x) log (x)), whereas
    the best error bound without RH is something like 
    O(x exp(-C (log x)^3/5 (log log x)^(-1/5)).


(2) There are explicit inequalities, due to Rosser and Schoenfeld
    (and improved by Guy & Robbins) that give the number of primes
    in an interval. They depend on no unproved hypotheses.
    If one takes two of their inequalities, one giving a lower bound,
    and one giving an upper bound, one sees that the possible error is
    TINY relative to the actual number of primes.

(3) Improving the error term simply means changing the possible error
    in the PNT by a very small fraction. It matters not if the number
    of primes up to x is li(x) or 1.01 li(x). For the orders of magnitude
    under discussion (e.g. 6.525 x 10^74  256-bit primes) it matters not
    a whit if that number is actually 6.524 x 10^74 instead.

    It is known that pi(x) > x/log x for sufficiently large x. I can't
    recall the exact least value of M such that it is true for all x > M,
    but M is not that large. The error term in the PNT is insignificant
    compared to x/log x.

    Fewer primes than we believe? Nonsense.

Try to break RSA by trial division with tables of primes is futile.
Actually it is WORSE than futile. It is IMPOSSIBLE. The universe is not
big enough to contain the necessary tables.

In the context this was said, it doesn't matter.  The point was 
that the theory is not the problem.  The practice is the problem.  

As the numbers get bigger, it takes more time or resources to do 
it, until above a certain size it is said not to be possible (ie 
NSA gives up).  No one knows for sure when the NSA will give up, 
or decide it is cheaper to bribe your confederates, but it is 
difficult to think of a message that they would be prepared to 
spend more than a few million dollars to read.

 The "Block Mixing Transform" technology which I have been promoting
 on sci.crypt for much of this spring and summer is a Latin square
 technology.  (This was part of my "Large Block DES" project, which
 eventually produced the "Fenced DES" cipher as a possible DES
 upgrade.)

 Each of the equations in a Block Mixing Transform is the equation
 for a Latin square.  The multiple equations in such a transform
 together represent orthogonal Latin squares.

 In this particular case I chose to use a finite field in mod 2
 polynomials; this provided better than usual support for reasoning
 about the cipher.  A big advantage of the technique is the ability
 to combine large-width blocks with linear effort.  A disadvantage
 is that the mixing is "weak," but the exact same thing can be said
 of exclusive-OR, another Latin square technology.

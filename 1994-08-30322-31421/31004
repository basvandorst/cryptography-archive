Here is a sample
char key[8]
char *break(char text[9],crypt[9])
{
 for(key[0]=0;key[0]<128;key[0]
 for (key[1]=0;key[1]<128;key[1]i++)
   .....
 for(key[7]=0;key[7]<128;key[7]++)
   if(! bcmp(DES(key,text),crypt,8)) return(key);
return(-1)
}
Write properly compile and run. Wait a while (say a million years on a
good workstation) and there you have it. You might if you have a million
dollars or so be able to cobble together some gates, etc to construct a
special computer to run the above instead ( it is a simple program after
all) and reduce that to a few hours or days, but I assumed that you have
a workstation.

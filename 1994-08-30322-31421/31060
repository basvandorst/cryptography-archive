My understanding of the FBI Wiretap bill is that the FBI gets copies of
the conversation sent down another wire.  They do not get to filter
the conversation or do a man-in-the-middle attack that way.  However,
the requirements on the telephone companies are going to be secret, so
we can't be sure.

There's nothing preventing them from doing a man-in-the-middle attack
by going to the central office and doing a cable-splice man-in-the-middle
attack there.  There's nothing preventing them from killing one of
the parties and impersonating him, either, except they need to come
up with a good excuse for doing so (He was living with a child, and
presumably abusing it, so we had to burn both of them to the ground.
No, they used that one already).

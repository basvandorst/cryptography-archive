It's nice that US-citizens told me that RSA or similare are patentable
in Europe, but RSA is not patendet due to prior art. This is definitly
false for Europeen Community and esp. in Germany. One has said that IDEA
is patented. This is true for SUISSE, not member of EU. And as far as I know,
this patent was made to be sure IDEA was public accessible.

In Germany and EU some patents possible in USA aren't possible here.
You can't hold a patent of genetic manipulated DNA , algorithms and so on.
However, if you found a hardwaresolution for a given problem, you can patent
this. I however, can write an emulator and can use this for free.

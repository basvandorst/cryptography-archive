I think I see the error... the assumption that "p-1" is "random".

The formula for the probability that a number does NOT have a factor of
a prime (p) from  a set S as factor
(product[over primes p in S:(1-1/p)])
only works for numbers large compared to the primes in the set (or their
product?)... eg. for N large, about 50% have no factor of 2 (are odd)...
or for N large, about (1-1/2)(1-1/3)(1-1/5)(1-1/7) of such numbers have
no prime factor smaller than ten (about 22%).

But... how about using primes up to N? E.g. product(2<p<N:(1-1/p)) for
the probability that N has no prime factor larger than 2?. By first
multiplying by all primes up to p0 with ln(1-1/p) being about -1/p (to
within a multiple close to one) and with the number of primes up to K
being (to within a number close to one) being K/ln(K) for p,K>p0
(getting a multiple, C) and doing the calculation from p0 to N, one
would get this probability as being: C*log(p0)/log(N) or >>1/log(N).

But the only way a number can have no prime factors greater than two is
to be a power of two... 2,2^2,...2^j... so there are at most log_2(N)/N
numbers which have no prime factors greater than two. This is much less
than 1/log(N).

It appears that the formula for the probability that a number has only
prime factors less than 2^K is vastly overstated! So, while the method
will decrypt messages (for which the largest prime dividing o_n(x) is
less than 2^K), the probability of having a potentially weak n (all
prime factors of p-1,q-1 are small) (for which all the messages could be
decrypted) seems to be DRASTICALLY overstated!

He makes it worse.

What Silverman fails to take account of is that this is not a refereed
cryptologic journal. It is a usenet discussion group.

It is not a requirement that readers have read Silverman's papers, nor that
they be at the level of his own work, or those of his peers. That kind of
exclusive community is not available on the net except in private mailing
lists with admission standards, or in private correspondence among peers.

If Silverman cannot explain himself in intelligent layman's terms, even with
the best intentions his posts will come across as arrogant if they are
posted generally in an unmoderated newsgroup such as this one. In
Silverman's case, he adds some of his own personality to the general
observation of this paragraph, making the situation even worse.

sci.crypt is not research.crypto.advanced.

By the way, so far Sam Pullara has gotten off easy. In the past, when
Silverman's responses are called into question he sometimes attacks the
questioner, at least in my experience.

Don't take it personally, Sam--even those who admire and respect Silverman's
work have acknowledged his personal foibles here. Sit tight and in time
you'll get the answer you're looking for.

The mathematical theory for factoring a large product of two primes
is easy:  Try dividing it by every number between 2 and itself - 1.
You can even use pencil and paper.  Theory doesn't concern itself
with practical problems like the time required to do it is more 
than the age of the universe or that our galaxy doesn't contain 
enough mass for the pencils required.  

If you think about it a little before undertaking this task, you
can eliminate all the even numbers except 2, limit yourself to
numbers between 2 and the square root of the number in question,
and avoid testing easily-determined composite numbers (like those
ending in 2, 4, 6, 8, 0, or 5).  This is still using 
stone-knives-and-bearskins methods compared to modern factoring
techniques.

It's my understanding that factoring techniques (the method, not
the implementation which may have made compromises knowing the
range of numbers it was dealing with) don't actually cease working 
when you give them much larger numbers.  Some other method may
be better in that range, and the technique may be so slow as to be
useless, but it will still work, eventually.

PGP is not vunerable to any known, effective cryptanalytic attacks. 
Lots of knowlegeable cryptographers entrust secret data to it.

This means it's not vunerable to any obvious attacks either; if you're
not a cryptanalyst, the attack you just thought of is obvious, so bear
this in mind when you ask about it.

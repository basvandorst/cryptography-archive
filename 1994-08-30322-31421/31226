If you have PGP, and can encode a text message with someone's public key
so that they can only decode it with their private key, you have three
of the four parts of the equation: plain text, public key, and encoded
text. Surely with these pieces (*especially* the encoded text and the
plain text), it would not be a tremendously difficult task to derive the
private key? And from there, with private key in hand, one could proceed
to decrypt all else that had been encoded with the public key.

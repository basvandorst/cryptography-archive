This is what I mean when I say some people just don't do their homework.

One can't understand discussions here without understanding the basic, key
concepts.  NP does  *NOT* stand for non-polynomial. It stands for
NON-DETERMINISTIC  polynomial.

May I suggest you read a chapter on complexity theory. Try, for example,
chapter 10 of Aho, Hopcroft & Ullman's "The design & analysis of computer
algorithms". This is an elementary intro to the subject.

Complexity generally refers to worst-case complexity. The fact that some
instances of a problem are solvable in P-time, does not mean that all are.

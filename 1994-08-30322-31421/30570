"What is MD2?  One-way hash functions for $1000, Alex."  ;^)

Don't rule out MD2 so quickly.  I believe you are looking at one of
the MD2 implimentations ("AI_MD2WithRC2_CBCPad" or something similar)
from the RSA BSAFE 2.0 crypto toolkit.  If you have access to the
toolkit you will find your table in MAC_PI_SUBST (MACPISUB.OBJ).
Also, if you take a look at RFC 1319 and you will find a similar table
called PI_SUBST in the Appendix that is the same size and is also
XOR'ed a byte at a time in the code.

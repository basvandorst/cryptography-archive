Someone posted an article here a while back that described a meeting
between an NSA delegation and Jim Bidzos at RSADSI.  I remember the
high-point of the thing being the NSA threatening to have Bidzos run
over in the parking lot.

If anyone still has this article, would you please e-mail it to me?

Thanks!

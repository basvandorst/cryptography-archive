Further, in an INTERNATIONAL conference, what is national security to 
one nation is national insecurity to the next, and I can assure you 
that anyone OUTSIDE the US is NOT impressed by repression of valid 
discussion because someone inside the US believes it contrary to US 
security interests.  Either this is an international conference or it 
is not, and if it is an international conference, US national security 
interests cannot be used as a basis of suppression of valid crypto 
discussion.

One man's opinion, of course, who is NOT in the Usurping States.

First off, can anyone suggest a good "cryptography dictionary"?  This
isn't the first time I've been annoyed at the lack of a good source
to check out a definition.

Secondly, here is my immediate confusion:  is there a distinction
between a trapdoor one-way function and a trapdoor one-way
permutation?

I know that the distinction between a generic function and the
specific class of functions known as permutations in this context
is that the permutations are one-to-one and onto, whereas the
non-specific "function" doesn't make this guarantee.  But in
the only definitions of a trapdoor one-way function that I've
been able to find it seems that the function in question must
be a permutation or else the definition is "not well defined".

The best definition of trapdoor one-way function that I have
found is:
  A trapdoor one-way function is defined as a family of invertible
  functions f_z, indexed by z, such that, given z, it is easy
  to find algorithms E_z and D_z ghat easily compute f_z(x) and
  f_z^-1(y) for all x and y in the domain and ramge, respectively,
  of f_z; but for virtually all z and for vitrually all y in the
  range of f_z, it is computationally infeasible to compute
  f_z^-1(y) even when one knows E_z.

This definition of a trapdoor one-way function seems to require
that f_z(.) have a one-to-one correspondence between the domain
and range, and thus f_z(.) is a permutation.  Or am I not reading
something right?

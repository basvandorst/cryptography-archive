Books.

Sure.  If you put enough work into something, I think you can do it usually.

I'd be more than happy to exchange whatever programs I might have so long
as doing so wouldn't violate the US export laws (which I think are
incredibly lame).  There is an ftp site that has a ton of crud on it,
the sci.crypt FAQ might have it.  It was somethign like swccs.[a few
three letter acronyms with s's in them].  I can't find it on my ftp
site paper.  But, you'll knwo which one I'm talking about should you see 
it come up.  Another place to start might be rsa.com.

Well, you obvioulsy didn't read the FAQ, cuz it says not to do that. :)
But, it seems to me that the definition of a good cipher is one which has
some kinda mathematical proof behind it, vs. a nobody has broken it yet
type of thing.

This is a really wuss encryption and can even be broken brute force with
a plaintext attack on a variable length key really easy.  Supposedly
there is some way to rotate the ciphertext so you get the key out of
it, but I haven't done this so I can't give you specific details.  That
is also commented on in the FAQ.

That is pretty wussy too, even for brute force.  

Since most of my encryption work revolves around that used in computer
viruses, both of these methods are of interest to me, sicne they are both
used often in encrypted viruses (and surely Vesselin will tell you all
about it, since I see he reads this group occasionally).  Nonetheless,
if you use a byte as a data type for each character, you don't even need
to do a modulus 256; just ignore a carry.  And, you will quickly see
that the ADD is also the same as doing a subtract on a computer, just
with a different key.

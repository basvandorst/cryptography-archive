OK, got some mail with the answer. Someone has found the factors of a
129-bit key. Since this is in range of good factorising programs it should
be no wonder. The Author of the rumor shall take a lesson in discrete
mathematics to discover that making key longer makes crypt safe again.

Thanks to all who answered me,

P.S: I've feared someone has invented a fast factoriser

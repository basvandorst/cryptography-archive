This is an interesting social question.  Who do you trust?  Who do you 
trust for paper analogues?

1.  Notary Publics?
2.  Banks?
3.  The Postal Service?
4.  People you know personally and trust?
5.  People certified by a trusted corporation or other entity?
6.  People in your own club or organization?
7.  Relatives?

Any "global" key management and certification system should be able to 
emulate this variety of trust structures.  Pure hierarchies with just one 
person at the top won't cut it.  Even if my key were signed by Almighty 
God, you might not believe in Him and/or wouldn't know where to find His 
public key.  My public key is signed by Philip Zimmermann.  He isn't God, 
of course, but he is a nice guy who made a significant contribution to 
cryptography with his "web of trust" key management model.  I think most 
key management can be expressed as a subset of the web of trust.

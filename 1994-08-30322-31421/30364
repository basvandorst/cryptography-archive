This is incorrect.  It did use public-key; it didn't use secret
algorithms or tamperproof hardware or security-by-obscurity,
unlike Clipper which uses all three.

Doesn't work, since the receiver has no way to verify that the sender's
wiretap field contains correct data, unless the sender and receiver
both share the same key, in which case the receiver can tap *all* the
sender's traffic, which even the government would probably agree is Not Good.

One way to do key retention in a pure secret-key system is to have key
distribution centers, the way people did before public-key.
Alice shares a private key with the KDC; so does Bob.
Alice encrypts a session key with her KDC key, ships it to the KDC,
which decrypts it, encrypts with Bob's KDC key, and ships it to Bob.
In the Clinton/Bush/Denning scenario, the KDC can just hang on to the key.

(Other variants affect who initiates the conversations, etc.,
such as having the KDC send Alice the key encrypted with Bob's key for
her to send to Alice, which is ok if you're not worried about chosen
plaintext attacks on your cryptosystem.)

Don't you mean "upper bound"? The only know lower bound is the trivial
one: M(N) where M(N) is the time to multiply numbers mod N.

:4. This was a useful result, except that there now was an algorithm
:   (ca. 1989) called the number field sieve [3]. It factors numbers of
:   the form $a^3 - b$ (a, b are small integers) in conjectured time
:   L[1/3, c + o(1)] and is conjectured to factor other integers (the
:   general NFS) in time L[1/3, c' + o(1)] where c' > c and estimated
:   to be ~1.90. Lenstra and Pomerance remark in [2]:
:
:Even though (G)NFS is asymptotically faster, the number of digits
:where it's implementations cross over those of other practical fast
:factoring algorithms (esp. the quadratic sieve) is pretty high.
:Perhaps Bob Silverman or others with experience in such matters will
:be able to throw some light on this.
 
Recent work of Arjen Lenstra with a multiple-large-prime variation of
GNFS has shown a crossover less than 110 digits with the Quad. Sieve.

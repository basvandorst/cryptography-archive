Related note: 
	Some video game company tried to prevent competitors from 
making game cartridges by including the requirement that the manufacturer's
name appear in video ram (thus be visible) in order for the game to
run cartridges.
	The US courts decided that, since this was a  requirement 
of the system being interfaced with, it was legit for competitors to
use this mechanism, even though the name was copyrighted.

	So if clipper datastreams contain the word "Mykotronix" as 
an *irreplaceable* part of their protocol, US legal preceident exists
for the barbarous hoardes that surround us :-) to use this protocol
to interface with our divinely inspired telecom gear, despite 
any copyrighting of that phrase.

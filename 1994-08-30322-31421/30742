It may be that NNs can be used to screen lots of text messages, for
example, for evidence that a "poor algorithm" was used, e.g., that the
text has significant nonrandomness in it.

(But I would view the neural nets as just another tool in the arsenal
of the cryptanalysts, along with statistical methods, AI, signal
processing, etc. All pretty much the same set of tools, basically.)

My point was more that well-designed modern ciphers like RSA and IDEA
appear to admit no such analysis based on "nonrandom" properties. If
anybody has found shortcuts to factoring the modulus in RSA, for
example, they haven't let on.

Caveat: Few of us outside the NSA and its sister agencies (including
former enemies, etc.) have done significant cryptanalysis. I know I
haven't. Those who munch on lots of traffic may well be using neural
nets, custom signal processing, etc. to "prepare" the captured traffic
for further analysis. A safe bet, in fact.

My comments were more to the question of whether neural nets are
useful in cracking ciphers per se, which I suspect not.

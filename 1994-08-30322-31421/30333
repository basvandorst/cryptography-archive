Yes, you are right about this.  I goofed on my algebra.  Of course this makes
it even less likely that maximum cycle lengths are important.

I'm not sure what you mean by this.  As long as your N's are Blum moduli
(products of P*Q where P and Q are congruent to 3 mod 4) you can run the
X^2 sequence backwards and read messages sent using BBS as a PK system
(where you send the last X value along with the XOR'd message).  "Special"
in this context refers to moduli where (P-1)/2 and (P-3)/4 prime.
That should not be a requirement for reading messages of this type.
(According to the proof of Theorem P, sqrt(X) mod P is x^((P+1)/4), and
similarly for Q.  Use the CRT to get sqrt(X) mod N.)

Yes, I have seen an algorithm for generating "strong" primes for RSA
(where (P-1)/2 must be prime) that simultaneously sieves for P and for
(P-1)/2.  It is somewhat slower than finding ordinary primes but not,
as you say, enormously so.  "Special" primes for BBS would be still
slower but perhaps tolerable.

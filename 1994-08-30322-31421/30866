   Okay, after reading the article on the RSA129 crack,
   I would like to know what the group or the leader of that effort 
   feels is now needed to break military grade RSA based their 
   experiment.


I suspect I'm going to regret this, but since I'm a "leader" (not my
choice of words) I'll leap in.

First: define "military grade RSA".  I do not know what that term
means.  I do not have an authoritative statement by the military,
whoever they are, as to whether they even use RSA, let alone what key
sizes they use.

   After all the real prize lies in breaking the military grade code
   which is > 10^15 times larger and a whole new ballgame.

Ah, a partial definition.  "> 10^15 times larger".  I assume the
comparison is with RSA129.  The use of the word "larger" is
interesting but I assume you meant "harder" or "more difficult".

   Yes I know that breaking RSA may not require factoring, but keep 
   this thread pure to the factoring idea.

Fair enough.

If what you are asking is "What do we need in order to factor numbers
which are presently over 10^15 times more difficult to factor than
RSA129?", the answer is quite simple.  Either we need hardware at
least 10^12 times faster, or radically better algorithms, or a
combination of both.  Personally, I think the algorithms are the best
bet; I don't see hardware improving by more than a factor of a million
any time soon.

Lest the sharp-eyed folk pick up on my 10^12, compared with the
question posed as 10^15, I'm assuming that someone who really cared
could acquire a thousand times more power than we used.

[speculation deleted]

   Will the information superhighway ever be safe if anyone
   could break such numbers, no...

My guess is yes.  History has shown that once it is widely known that
a cryptosystem is cheaper to break than the value information it
protects, the cryptosystem is either strengthened or replaced.  We
already know how to increase the strength of RSA and there are many
other cryptosystems out there.

In that case, you are using a "one-time" key for the cipher,
which means that it is pretty much *not* solvable, unless you 
have a message that is "long" with respect to the key length.

But with enough computing power to throw at it, it's probably
solvable. By brute force if nothing else. *Especially* if one
follows the usual "given" that the *method* is known, and
only the *key* (K1, K2 pair) is unknown. 

Figure out how long it'll take a 486 or a Vax to crank thru all
possible combos of K1 & k2. Plaintext is *very* recognizable. So
I can have the program only dump out the stuff that closely resembles
it.

Its not as easy to reverse engineer clipper as it is other chips. They have
put in a few traps for the unwary so you will end up needing quite a few of
the suckers before you get it right.

I still beleive that the algorithm will be published on the Internet within
a year of the chip being avaliable to the general public. When they do I might
implement it in Shen :-)


Personally I think the clipper chip is a dreadfull idea. Its like reading the
last chapter in a book to find out what the ending is. It really does spoil
all the fun. The LEAF is in my view simply unsporting.

Nope - with a single overwrite, slight variations in the degree of
magnetization indicate the previous state. This is where the electron
microscope comes in; if there was no overwrite, undelete utilities will
recover the data in seconds. The received wisdom seems to be that for
sensitive data, it should be randomly overwritten several times. Someone
else may have more exact info on this?

Of course there are a lot of destructive ways to erase a disk, but I
wouldn't bet on anything that relies on smashing it. Some of these guys are
real good at jigsaw puzzles...

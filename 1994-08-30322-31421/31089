Or find someone with a nice LF spectrum analyzer like an HP 3585B  (ask 
HP for a demo :-).   The EMI will be plenty obvious as big spikes on the
otherwise smooth noise floor.

Dealing with noise is tough.  I find that if you really want to generate 
noise, and not amplified EMI you either have to go into a big hole (like the 
sub-basement of a big building) or hop into a Faraday cage.  Building the 
circuit in a metal box will also work, as long as you are careful to use 
feedthru caps on the dc lines and shielded coax for the noise signal. It is 
also a big help to use a low impedance system (ie not the inputs of an OP 
amp).  In any case, you will never escape the dreaded WWV 10Mhz carrier if 
you are in North America, and n*60Hz is also everywhere.

With regards to the original posters experiments, you will find that 
maybe a FET is a better way to go as it will have horrible 1/f noise
specs.  Typically the 1/f noise current (short circuit) can be modelled
as     
                  AF
    i_n = KF * Id^
               --
                f

where Id is the drain current and KF and AF are constants for the device.
1/f will usually dominate out to about 10MHz for your typical noisy FET.
You will see powers on the order of -120 dBm (1Hz bandwidth) around 10kHz
to 1 Mhz.  Be careful you are not shorting out your noise near dc by
using inappropriate filter caps on the dc supply.

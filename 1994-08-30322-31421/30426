I read in the FAQ (and already knew) that a linear congruent PRNG works
poorly for cryptography.

What about using multple ones.  For example, I prepared a short program
that uses all of the 53 primes (other than 2) less than 256 as moduli,
and chooses a multiplier M_k for each prime P_k such that the sequence
generated by modulus P_k will not repeat for P_k - 1 iterations.
A hashing password (or phrase) typed in by the user serves to produce
initial values for all the generators.

The LCM of P_k - 1 over all the primes less than 256 is about
2.6e25.  If the output is the sum mod 256 of all the generators,
an attacker who wanted to guess the key would have to locate himself
in a 2.6e25 byte long sequence.  If he were already in possession of,
say, the first n bytes of the sequence, how difficult would it be for
him to determine bytes n+1, n+2, etc?

I would recommend changing the low-pass filter into a band-pass filter
that cuts off 60 Hz, since this is almost always present to some
degree.

You should also examine the output of any amplifiers that clip.  The
recovery time for a clipped amplifier is sometimes slow, and you want
fast recovery compared to the bandwidth of your noise signal.  You
also want roughly equal recovery times from both positive and negative
rails.

I'm surprised you can't get more from this.  But that's okay, better
to grab too few bits than too many.

You need to run some LARGE statistical tests if you want reasonable
confidence that this is working well.  Let us know how it goes!

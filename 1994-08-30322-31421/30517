You are right and I was wrong. I misremembered the original message, which
does refer to the European Community.

However, the writer's contention is still false. RSA would be patentable in
the European Community if not for prior publication. The original message
says "RSA and other krypto-algorithms" making it clear the writer was not
referring to the prior publication of RSA in the U.S.

He is wrong because the RSA patent is not a "krypto-algorithm" patent, but a
system or process patent including the input, output, etc. It specifies
means including hardware. Process patents ARE patentable in the EU and there
are plenty of them.

The writer made a common error--that of thinking the RSA patent was on an
algorithm or mathematical formula, or software, none of which are patentable
in many jurisdictions. It is not. It is a complete cryptographic system
patent. That it incorporates an algorithm in the middle is no more a bar to
patents than that a chemical process plant incorporates a temperature
control algorithm in the middle.

The patents are written with broad enough claims that unless you can figure
out a way to do cryptography with no inputs or outputs, anything practical
you can do cryptographically with RSA is covered. Thus in effect the
algorithm is "sewn up" for cryptographic purposes. But the patent is not an
algorithmic one.

(Thanks for taking the trouble to dig out the original message. I'm just
learning how to navigate threads in my newsreader--it will make it easier to
check the text of earlier messages in a thread.)

taken to extremes the spurious notion of freedom without responsibility, and

are told by their pals that they are in the middle of the road. Nothing is
wrong any more (except, of course, conservative thoughts and expressions).

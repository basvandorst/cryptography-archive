Can anyone answer (or else point me to the best place to answer) a
fairly simple question about DES-CBC?

Using a plaintext file of Ascii NUL's (0x00) and using some
arbitrary DES encryption key K and initialization vector IV, can an
opponent predict the N+1-th through the  N+k-th bytes of the
CBC mode ciphertext knowing only the first N bytes of the
ciphertext and that the plaintext is Ascii NUL's?

If not, is there any plaintext for which an opponent can predict
the N+1-th through N+k-th bytes?

(That is, any means short of a full break of the DES key K using
known methods for directly breaking DES, of which my recollection
is that the best current method involves ~2^47 ciphertext-plaintext
pairs).

As a related question, can the same question be answered for IDEA
or MDC ciphers?

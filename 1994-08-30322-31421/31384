Hi all

Apologies if this question has already been beaten to death, 
but I couldn't find it in the FAQ.

In the July PC Mag is a program called wincrypt, that uses 
the rules from Conway's Life to generate a scrambled 512 byte key 
that is XOR'ed with the message to be encrypted. 
It does this by treating the 4096 bits as a 64 by 64 cell matrix, and
it applies 1 round  of the life rules.

What I found interesting about this scheme, is the idea of
using the game of life as a one way function, given that it is completely
deterministic in the one direction, but a given position could come from
a large number of possible previous positions after several iterations.

Does anyone have any ideas on the suitability of cellular automata as 
one-way functions?

Thanks
Andrew

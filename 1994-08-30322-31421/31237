Would you mind an estimation of how much storage one needs to store so many 
primes?

Let's say for the purpose of cracking 512-bit RSA, which is pretty much the 
minimum an RSA user would use.  So we are interested in a prime number 
table of all primes below 2^256.

The prime number theorem more or less says that there are more or less 
2^256 / log(2^256) primes below 2^256.  (Here log means natural logarithm.)  
So we estimate that there are 6.5*10^74 primes.

(For reference purpose this is a more accurate statement of the prime 
number theorem: as x approaches infinity, the number of primes below x when 
divided by x/log(x) approaches 1.)

Now we need to propose a really concise way of storing those 6.5*10^74 
primes.  Then we will estimate the number of bytes required, then we will 
choose a really cheap storage media and estimate the cost.  I will leave 
these to you. :)  But I suspect the Earth does not have that kind of 
resource.  Maybe you can help by using Jupiter or something but beware of 
comet collisions. :)

Ok so you may object and say "of all those primes the smaller ones are 
useless since we expect the prime divisors of an RSA modulus is pretty 
big".  Excellent observation. :)  So how about counting the primes between 
2^255 and 2^256?  That will be very roughly 6.5*10^74 - 2^255/log(2^255), 
right?  Which is 3.2*10^74.  Perhaps this time the Earth can barely store 
that.  But why on Earth would anyone want to do that?! :)

Ok, lets assume *you* on Earth do want to do that.  So let's crack a 
512-bit modulus using that huge prime table.  So you are confronted with 
3.2*10^74 trial divisions.  (Or you say on average 1.6*10^74 divisions.  
Fine.)  Now here comes the final blow: who on Earth would have the time to 
wait for that?

The catch is that the number of primes we're interested in is about 
x/log(x), which is nearly exponential w.r.t. the number of bits (512) in 
the modulus.  On the other hand good factoring algorithms runs in 
subexponential times w.r.t. the number of bits.  Meaning those factoring 
algorithms runs faster than trial division even if you've already got hold 
of a prime table.  Thus trial division is kind of out of the question.

> Q: What did the RSA-128 people do with all the numbers they found??

Caution: they didn't build any huge prime table.  They did use a small 
one, but that one is so small that you can memorize it.  (Yeah right. :)  
The small prime table is used to help find X & Y such that N divides 
X^2-Y^2, where N is the number to be factored.  I.e. the small prime table 
is not used against N directly.  I refer you to other netters here for 
further descriptions of the quadratic sieve and the number field sieve. :)

like to bug somebody in sci.math too. :) :)

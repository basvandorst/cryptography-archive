While the logical flow here is not entirely clear, it seems to be:
A1  * the First Amendment (part of the Bill of Rights) guarantees citizens
      the right to say anything that they like
A2  * therefore people have the right to transmit anything over the Net that
      they like
A3  * therefore people have the right to distribute cryptography over the Net
A4  * therefore arresting someone for distributing cryptography over the Net
      would violate the Bill of Rights

B1  * the American people are invariably incensed when the Bill of Rights is
      violated
B2  * therefore the American people would be incensed if someone were arrested
      for distributing cryptography over the Net

I responded first to A1, which is not true:

This response to my critique is itself confused.  I am sure that it is not
'treason' to transmit government secrets.  Government secrets are leaked
every day.  People may occasionally get fired, but they are never shot.

What the government has actually done is to classify cryptographic
techniques as weapons (munitions).  You may or may not agree with this.
In fact, of course, such techniques have obvious military applications.
At least tens of thousands of Germans were killed during the Second World
War because the Enigma codes were compromised.	Dead is dead.  They were
killed with cryptographic techniques.  So arguably cryptography = weapon.

Were I a government lawyer, I would say what I said above, concluding that
cryptography is a weapon, you can kill people with it.	You can't get more
trampled upon than that.  Dead is dead.


I then turned to proposition B1, which I believe to be generally untrue:

The response is off the point.	Whether the FBI won or lost is irrelevant
to the B thread.  My point is that B1 is generally not true and therefore
B2 is unsupported.


I may or may not agree with the substance of what you are saying.  But
the presentation consists of a string of bald assertions which are
frequently wrong.  Would the American people rise up because someone was
arrested for exporting cryptography?  Well, no.  Most of them wouldn't
have the faintest idea of what cryptography is.  And if it were explained
to them by a reasonably intelligent government lawyer ("these people are
behind the international trade in kiddie porn"), I believe that a large
majority of the American people would vote to hang.

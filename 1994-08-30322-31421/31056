Looking around, it seems many first time posters are using
subjects like "NEWBIE alert" and such.  I think this a Good
Thing.. unless of course more experienced people stop reading
(and thus answering) such posts.

Anyways I thought of an interesting/entertaining idea - how
about a Newbie-bot that scanned sci.crypt for articles with the
word "newbie" in their subject line - the poster would be
automagically mailed a copy of the FAQ.

I could see this getting out of hand, but it's an interesting
idea..

"To get the sci.crypt FAQ, just post in sci.crypt with "newbie"
in the subject line - the FAQ will find you."

We need a sci.crypt Kibo..  :)

Magic phrases such as "I know nothing about cryptography -
please help!" uttered anywhere on Usenet would get you the
relevevant FAQ's.  The newbie-bot could be kept updated with
David's current .sig so that he receives a copy of alt.atheism's
"How to construct a logical argument" everytime he posts. 
Cliched NSA-bait words would get you an ominous forged mail
message from a site called nsa.gov

Imagine the possibilities...

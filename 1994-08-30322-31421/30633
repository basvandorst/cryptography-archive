True, indeed.

This is the next best thing.  Make every block on the floppy a function 
not only of the key, but of some value (a random initialization vector, 
perhaps) on the disk.  To destroy the data in a hurry when the bad guys 
(or cops, in your case) are breaking and entering, all your hot key 
function has to do is to overwrite the initialization vector (which you 
don't have memorized or copied elsewhere) with some garbage.  This 
instantly makes all data on the disk unrecoverable, unless you can either 
break the encryption algorithm or do a brute force search for the random 
value.  This could be used to nearly instantly destroy the data on hard 
disks, too.

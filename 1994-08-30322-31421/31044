There are cryptographic methods that let you get down to maybe 2**47
iterations of DES if you can do chosen plaintext, but DES is strong
enough that you basically need to do brute force to crack it.
Unix password cracking is the same way - it uses a bunch of iterations
of a slightly modified DES.  What makes Crack and programs like it
work well is that people typically *don't* choose good passwords;
they choose things they can remember, mostly from lower-case alpha and numbers,
so you may need to try 36**7 or 26**6 * 36**2 guesses instead of 128**8,
or maybe even the ~100K words in your dictionary.

What you need to build a convenient DES cracker, for the case where
you think the victim has used wimpy passwords, is a way to input some
known plaintext and grind it through all the wimpy passwords,
and maybe save the output on a sorted list for you to look up later
if you think he's used the same known plaintext a lot.
Crack doesn't do this, because the "salt" used in Unix password
encryption increases the amount of grinding and storage by 4096,
which is enough to be annoying.

I recall reading a Technical Note from the Laboratory for Computer Science at 
MIT on the implementation of a hardware random number generator. As with your 
current design, they used a noise source followed by a digitizer, and the 
paper went into the statistical tests needed to verify the randomness of 
the resulting bit stream.

I haven't looked lately, but I suspect that a ftp or gopher walk around 
lcs.mit.edu might lead you to an online copy of the paper.

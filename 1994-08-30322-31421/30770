Rubbish.  GSM uses TDM and frequency-hopping to get the best out of the 
available communications channels, but beyond that the decoding of the 
control channel is no more difficult than of TACS control channels.  After 
that there's only the encryption, which is applied *after* the error 
correction, so that breaking it involves trying every key and performing an 
error check to see whether you've guessed right (a bit like the way Pkzip 
crackers work).  It has been estimated that a brute-force attack on A5 would 
take about a week to recover a key, with optmisations being possible to give 
a significant speedup.
 
These security claims sounds like some Bellsouth propaganda I was exposed to 
recently which also claimed incredible figures for breaking GSM security 
(something like $50-100M).
 
Peter.

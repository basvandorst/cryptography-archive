	I have been working on an encryption algorithm which I
might, at some point in the future, post to sci.crypt for a
critique by its readers. I was wondering-- given that I am
posting from the United States and that the post will go
all over the world, could I get busted for violating
export restrictions if I include in my post any c code from the
implementation of the algorithm? Or is that a bit paranoid?
	I've set follow-ups to talk.politics.crypto.

I have. Repeatedly. In fact, I've lost count of the number of times
I've discussed these issues.

What I object to is people who don't know what they are talking about
posting their "opinions" as if they were fact, and *usually* getting it
wrong. It gets tiring after a while.

Not bad grammar. Gibberish. There is a difference between (say) a simple
grammatical error such as a subject/verb mismatch, and gibberish.
This is a printed medium. If you can't be bothered to elucidate your
thoughts clearly, or to take the time to proofread your posts, then why
should others bother to read them? Sloppy writing indicates sloppy thinking.

When one goes for a job interview you will be judged not only by WHAT you
say, but also by HOW you say it. Are you articulate? Do you use good grammar?
Do you clearly present your thoughts? Failure to do so can mark one as 
poorly educated, even if that person has a terrific technical background.
In a printed medium, such as this one, it is VITAL to say what you mean
in a clear fashion because facial expressions, body language, tone of
speech etc., are not conveyed. Readers only receive what is written.

An incomplete sentence is not merely bad grammar.

Once again, there is a difference between babbling and bad grammar.
I was not criticizing grammar, but failure to communicate clearly in a
subject area that requires clear ideas and definitions.

 
And resorting to personal name calling is a pretty sure sign that the
antagonist has run out of constructive things to say.

Most of the people on the net don't think, period. They shoot their mouths
off about subjects they know very little about. 
 
And once again, someone who resorts to name calling clearly has nothing
constructive to say.

It is bad netiquette [and stupid in general] to discuss a subject without
having done any library research on the subject.

I get tired of seeing the same ridiculous assertions about this subject made
over and over. People who post without knowing anything about a subject
*deserve* to get flamed.

No. But I am the only one who posts regularly who knows this subject
area. As such, it is my duty to pour water on nonsense. If such criticism
offends people, then I suggest they learn to distinguish between criticisms
of their IDEAS from criticisms of THEM. [But you seem quite good at the latter,
don't you? Why don't you try criticizing the content of my posts, instead].

You will note carefully that although I said people did not know what they
were talking about, I refrained from any namecalling or personal attacks.
Telling someone they do not know what they are talking about is a statement
about the content of their posts and their state of knowledge, and NOT a 
name calling, personal attack.

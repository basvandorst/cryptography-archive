The *VERY FIRST* use of RSA in practice was at Los Alamos National
Labs.  RSA was used to verify access cards at the entry gates to a
complex storing weapons grade plutonium.  RSA was used so that the
access cards could be programmed at a heavily central facility, thus
preventing attackers from dismantling an access box and prying the
access codes from it (the box contained public keys only).

The RSA key length was conservatively chosen to resist the best known
factoring attacks of the time with considerable room to spare.  The
length chosen?  336 bits.  They are not using this system any more.

I'm following up from a thread called "2-oscillator RNG's".  This subject 
seems more apt.  Terry Ritter posted a discussion of "establishing a 
relationship between population and the number of 'matches' found in 
trials of random samples."  I intend to read his paper in Cryptologia, 
but in the meantime I solicit comments from those more informed on 
statistics than I am.

I tested my hardware RNG this way:

I collected 100 files each of samples of sizes 2K, 5K and 10K.  The 
samples were considered to be 8-bit numbers [0...255].  For each file I 
measured the mean, second moment, third moment, fourth moment, chi-square 
and runs up and runs down.

The chi-square was computed with 255 degrees of freedom.  I also computed 
the probability function for each file.  I plotted the chi-square values 
and found that the fell in a gaussian-looking distribution (I didn't 
calculate this, just eye-balled it).  If I understand correctly what 
these test are telling me, they indicate a generator with good random 
properties.  However, for larger files, a small excess of "1" bits began 
to show up (about 0.5% excess).  The chi-squares for these samples became 
more skewed toward the high-probability values, as the sample size became 
larger.  To me, this indicates the generator has a slight bias.  
Averaging the samples with XOR eliminated this.

Can anyone suggest specific additional tests (easily implemented, if 
possible!) to test the properties of this generator?

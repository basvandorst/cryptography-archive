Just for reference, the question of what is or is not patentable
in Europe had NOTHING to do with the RSA situation --- that was 
decided based solely on the fact that US patent law allows one to
file for a patent up to one year after publication while European
patent law dictates that you must file BEFORE publication.  The RSA
article was published before the patent application was filed...

Now, back to the discussion about whether such inventions could be
patented or not...

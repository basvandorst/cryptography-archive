It wasn't obvious to me either, but here is one idea.  It is a
natural way to make some stream ciphers easier to use.
Suppose your stream cipher in raw form just takes a key vector and
a plaintext stream and outputs (not to the same place) both a 
ciphertext stream and a new key vector. For many
stream ciphers, such as XOR with a cryptographically strong pseudo-
random number generator, it weakens the cipher to the point of
triviality if you reuse the same key vector on multiple messages.
It's hard on the users to make them keep track of the new key vector
and use it on the next message.

One solution is to take a good-sized block of plaintext, hash it with
a function which perhaps need not be cryptographically strong, and
combine the hash with the user-input key to get the key vector for
the block.  The hash must be transmitted along with the ciphertext.
A refinement is to delete a hash-sized piece of plaintext after hashing
but before encrypting, making sure that the hash function can
be inverted by the recipient to recover the missing piece. This could
be a design problem if the hash for some reason needs to be otherwise
cryptographically strong.

We seem to have wound up with a block cipher, even though the original
motivation was all stream-oriented. It's worth mentioning that this
cipher leaks a little information since the hash is not concealed.
A minimum block size probably is needed to prevent this from being
too serious. This implies that no messages may be shorter than this,
and that the last block must be combined with the previous one if
it would be too short.

I'm sure there are other ways to get a block cipher out of a stream
cipher ...

Page 231 of Abramowitz and Stegun (quote):

(Assuming Riemann's hypothesis that all nonreal zeros of zeta(z) have
a real part of 1/2)

5.1.50  li(x) - pi(x)  =  O(sqrt(x)*ln(x) )

(end quote)

I will admit to misinterpreting the graph that is shown just below that,
which suggests that li(x) - pi(x) > 0, but does not state that explicitly.
That was a stupid mistake on my part, and Mr. Silverman has every right
to try to lead this horse's ass to knowledge on that count.

But the quote more than suggests that there is some dependency of the
Prime Number Theorem on R.H.  Of course Abramowitz and Stegun is a
reference work of material that the authors gathered from other sources.
The do not cite a source for eq. 5.1.50.  Is it possible that somebody
published a work that had an error in it that A & S might have quoted,
or perhaps A & S misinterpreted somebody's work?

Perhaps my approximation algorithm for li(x) needs some work (actually
it approximates Ei( ln(x) ), which is the same thing).

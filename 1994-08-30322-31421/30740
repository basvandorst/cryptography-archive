The book is called "Verschlusselt, Der Fall Hans Buhler".  It is not
written by Hans Buhler, but by a Swiss journalist named Res Strehle.
The book is published on Werd Verlag, Postfach, CH-8021 Zurich,
phone: +41 1 248 46 99; fax: +41 1 248 50 39. The price is SFr. 34.80
and it contains 200 pages.

Hans Buhler was imprisoned in Iran for 292 days and was fired from
his employer Crypto AG 52 days after he was released. To my knowledge
Hans Buhler did not go public before he was fired in 1993 and the book
was first published this spring.  There has also been a one hour TV
program on Swiss TV on his case, which is indeed quite interesting and 
which poses a number of questions.

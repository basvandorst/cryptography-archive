WordPerfect changed the encryption algorithm used for password protection 
of files after version 5.2.  The newer encryption is significantly better 
than the earlier one.  There are programs such as WPcrak which will break 
the passwords up to and including version 5.2, but I have not seen one 
which will break version 6.0.

Does anyone have knowledge of the encryption algorithm used for version 6.0?

Are there any ftp sites that could be of assistance?

If so, please e-mail me at johnk@indirect.com with the info.

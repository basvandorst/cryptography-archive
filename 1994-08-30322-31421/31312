Having read the ITAR regulations I would like to know how does the 
restriction of exporting strong cryptographic algorithms to other than 
US states protect the relevant parties.

Living in the New South Africa, in the times of the sanctions, the South 
African Arms Industry became exceptionaly strong due to these 
restrictions.

I see the point of a sanction whereby the resources being restricted is 
of such a nature that it would have impact on the desired party. Having 
a restriction based on intellectual property does not make any logical 
sense. What if the parties that this restriction applies on create their 
own crypto algorithm that is used by them. How would this affect the US 
then?

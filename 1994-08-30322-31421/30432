For us Postscript-impaired folks, could you also just post the plaintext
and let us struggle with the last 10%?

Um, I guess that depends on your definition of reasonable.  The way I
figure it, 40*40/6 is about 270 holes to be filled per quarter-rotation.
This works out to between 6 and 7 consecutive characters, on average, of
the message appearing on any given line for a given direction (left
to right, right to left).  Plus there is a relationship between the
characters appearing, say, in line 1 with those in line 40, etc.

Although grunting one's way through your post is a bit much for an
armchair cryptanalyst to tackle in an evening, I would imagine a
determined attacker should not find it too difficult to write a program
to mechanize the attack.

Cheers...

P.S. BTW, your message doesn't contain the word "element", does it?

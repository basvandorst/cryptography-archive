 From what I have seen in the short time I have been reading this groups
articles no one has taken exception to any scientifically expressed 
reasoning by Bob Silverman.

The only verbal criticism, which does not seem to amount to warfare, 
has been against his  quite unscientific personal asides and what I would
judge to be an inflammatory language style.

If there are to be pre-requisites then those who read the qroup,are also
entitled to expect they include an ability to  express scientific matters
with courtesy and  good taste.   

Many people (and I would count myself among them) believe that such a talent
is as much the sign of a finely developed mind as the ability to understand
and apply the most complex of formulae.

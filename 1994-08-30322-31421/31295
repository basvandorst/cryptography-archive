The cipher is of course under-specified here and what we see doesn't
give us much confidence, but Gaussian elimination should not work, at
least not directly.  Addition and exclusive or are both linear, but
over different fields.  The combination should not be linear over any
field.

I'm a little worried by his citations of toy crypto.

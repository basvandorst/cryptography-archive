	Spread spectrum was not developed as an encryption scheme.  The 
properties that makes it desirable are :

	Protection against jammers.  This is measured in the AJ (anti-
		jam) ratio.  Some simple math shows how much more jammer
		energy is needed to cause bit errors(digital communications)

	Low probability of intercept.  SS signals can be placed below the
		noise floor in many cases.  This means that covert operation
		can be conducted with some communications.

	Most people confuse the encryption with the last one.  If the method
for spreading and the code is known, a little bit of work will show you the
signal.  For more information I believe Sklar's "Digital Communications" has
a chapter on it.  This was the text that was used when I took a class on this,
and it seemed pretty good.

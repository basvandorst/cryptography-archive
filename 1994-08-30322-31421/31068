The problem with 3c is that I can easily think of malicious alterations 
that are very close to 3b - examples: changing a smile to a frown, or 
altering some minor text (street signs). Those kind of alterations can 
be more than enough to change the meaning of the picture without 
changing the distance metric very much.

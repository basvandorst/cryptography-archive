	If I remember properly, the 900Mhz band was reserved for spread 
spectrum, and because of the modulation used, it is in a way allready 
encrypted (I know the general principles of Spread Spectrum, but I am not 
sure of the exact form of modulation used). Unfortunaly, it uses the 
equilvent of a 16 bit key (65536 codes), and therefore not secure from 
anyone with any decent electrical, or cryptographic knoladge.

   Wait a minute.  I thought magic squares were those things where the sum
   of columns are all equal as are the rows, and the diagonals.

   I thought that numbered squares useful for transposition were knight's
   tours of the chessboard.


OK, here's the cyphertext.  It's problem 10 in Gaines.  It's also so
easy that I'm giving no clues.

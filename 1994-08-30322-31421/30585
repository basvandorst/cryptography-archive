Thanks for checking it out. I think the issue will be theoretical unless
someone else patents a similar system. ASCOM AG has U.S. IDEA patents as
well as Swiss ones. Do they have EU ones? That might tell the story right
there.

In addition, the new round of GATT has harmonized patent policy, so areas
where the U.K. was, to some extent, off on its own may no longer apply.

taken to extremes the spurious notion of freedom without responsibility, and

are told by their pals that they are in the middle of the road. Nothing is
wrong any more (except, of course, conservative thoughts and expressions).

The normal statistical test applied to this situation is the chi-squared
test, in which one calculates the sum of (observed-expected)^2/expected
and asks how often one would expect to get such a large value from a
genuinely random source. In the present case, the value is 15.155,
with "9 degrees of freedom" (corresponding to the ten bins, less the
one constraint that their sum be fixed). A truly random source would
produce a chi-squared value greater than this (i.e., a distribution more
uneven than this) in 8.7% of trials. This does not qualify as "statistically
significant" (the customary threshold for which is 5%) unless you are the
United States Environmental Protection Agency and are hard up to reach a
predetermined conclusion. ((The moved the finish line to 10% for the
second-hand tobacco smoke study.))

That is a meaningless question.  There is no such thing as absolute
safety.  As one approaches it, asymtotically, cost approaches infinity and
all other values approach zero.

If you mean on RSA, most certainly.  I stake my life on far less efficient
mechanisms every day.  

Courtney's first law: "Nothing useful can be said about the security of a
mechanism except in the context of a specific application and a specific
environment."

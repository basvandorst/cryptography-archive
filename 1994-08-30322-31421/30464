I find it easy to believe.  They probably fabricated a lifetime
supply of the things, and now they are all sitting on a shelf
somewhere.

The ATT's of the world are not interested in being commercial
chip suppliers, nor do they continuously manufacture
anything but extremely high-volume parts (memories etc.).

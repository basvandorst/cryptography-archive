   A standard digital signature won't accept a change of even one bit.
This is really a nice feature for most applications, but not necessarily
for this one.  I think the best you could do would be a digital signature
of some cannonical image format that all other formats could be reduced to
(lower-resolution than any other format, probably) along with an algorithm
for reducing any digital image to one and only one standard representation.

   The closest thing I can think of is a string distance measurement.
This might go well with the standard image format.  If you've got some
noise, so long as the standard format's string distance from the signed
version of image (in standard format) is less than some constant, you
accept the signature.
 
   Now for the real ugly questions:  How do you design a string distance
measure for an image that allows a little static, but not a meaning-changing
alteration of the image?

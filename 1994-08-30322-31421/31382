let me correct some (more) misinformation.

:I have found the following info on the density of prime numbers.
 
I am curious where you found it. Certainly your quoted references do not
state what you claim.

:
:The function that gives the number of primes less than or equal to
:a number, N, is called pi(N).
:
:There is an unproven conjecture in analysis called the Riemann
:hypothesis, which states that the zeros of a function called
:the Riemann zeta function are restricted to a certain region.
:No counterexamples have yet been found.  The concensus (for
:what it's worth) among mathematicians is that R.H. is very
:likely to be true (my info is on this is dated 1952.  Perhaps
:there has been progress on this problem since then).  If the
:conjecture is true, it implies that pi(N) is approximated by
:
:
:  integral from 0 to N of dx/ln(x)
:
(1) pi(N) ~ li(N) does NOT depend on this conjecture. pi(N) ~ li(N)
    is the Prime Number THEOREM.

:This is called the log integral, or li function.  The implication
:is further that:
:
:     li(N) - pi(N) is always positive and on the order of
 
(2) Where do you get this implication? It is false. It was proved by
    Littlewood that li(N) - pi(N) changes sign infinitely often.

:     sqrt(N) * ln(N)
 
(3) This is indeed the order of the error term if RH is true, but where
    did you get the idea that it is always POSITIVE? Certainly not from
    any text you read.

:So, if R.H. is true, the number of primes < 1e100, for example, is
:about 4.36e97, with an error of only about 2.3e52 (not much out
 
No! The number of primes < 1e100 is at least 4.342944e97 and does NOT
depend on RH.

Existing guidelines suggest that "history of cryptology"
questions/discussions belong on sci.crypt for lack of a better
home.  With this new newsgroup around I'd like to poll the
denziens of sci.crypt as to what forms of questions relating to
the history of cryptology are appropriate for:
  sci.crypt only
  soc.history.science,sci.crypt crosspost
  soc.history.science only

Any thoughts?

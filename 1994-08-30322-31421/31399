I just posted another message in this thread on where Li(x) - pi(x)
first changes sign. Quoting again from "The little book of big primes"
by Paulo Ribenboim on the difference between x/log(x) and pi(x):
"In 1962, using a very delicate analysis, Rosser & Schoenfeld showed
that, if x >= 17, then x/log(x) <= pi(x)."

Rosser, J. B. & Schoenfeld, L. "Approximate formulas for some
functions of prime numbers", Illinois J. Math., 6, 1962, 64-94.

The citation for the other message I posted, on the change of sign of
Li(x) - pi(x), is

te Riele, H. J. J. "On the sign of the difference pi(x) - li(x)",
report NM-R8609, Centre for Math. and Comp. Science, Amsterdam, 1986;
Math. Comp. 48, 1987, 323-328.

	I have a question about ``undeniable digital
signature''.   Why it is so called?

	In the book I read, ``undeniable digital 
signature'' different from common digital signature
that without the consent of the signer, one can't 
prove it to another people.
	Why use the word ``undeniable'' in its name?


	Thanks in advance.


Best Regards,

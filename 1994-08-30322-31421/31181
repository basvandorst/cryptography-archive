Hello

I've been trying to recompile PGP on IBM PC. Under DOS everything
was OK, but when I tried to port some functions under Windows...
(namely, random.c), apparently, Windows doesn't permit to use
outp() function, so I cannot build truly random number generator...

Please, please, if you know how to solve this problem, amswer to me.

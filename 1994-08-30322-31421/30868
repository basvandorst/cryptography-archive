Thanks.  And thanks also to those who replied privately.  I got through
the files in question and at least my curiosity was satisfied.  I didn't
find anything "juicy" but at least I got some nice floppies I can re-use. :)
 
Although it was not my initial intention, this sparked an interesting
conversation amongst some of my co-workers at the office recently.  Its
amazing just how many people trust the "encryption" in Word and WordPerfect. 
Thanks to this little thread, I have convinced a few people to start keeping
sensitive word processing on floppies that can be locked away instead of on
the LAN where anyone can get at them. 
 
Thanks,
   --Peter

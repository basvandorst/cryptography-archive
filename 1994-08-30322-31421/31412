Well, let's see.  KOH is, first of all, not a program that acts like a
virus, it *is* a virus.

I'm not familiar with "Good Virus #1 v1.01", but if it is anything like
KOH, then it is probably as shoddy.

First off, why would you want to use a virus to encrypt your drive vs. using
a real program.  What benefits does a virus offer?

Secondly, KOH has some bugs, and it's not too hard to loose data.  Which
tech support number do you call in order to try to salvage some of your
data once it has been hosed?

Thirdly, the encryption method used in KOH may not be  legally exported out
of the US, and it was designed here in the US.  Would you be so kind to tell
us where you got this from?  Was it ftp.netcom.com??

While on that same line -- keep in mind that netcom has made it known they
do not care if their users place viruses or similar programs available for
anonymous ftp to whoever, so if you are ftp'ing to there, make sure you know
exactly what you are doing.

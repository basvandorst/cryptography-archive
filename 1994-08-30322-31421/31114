Right.

I seem to recall at the point when I left grad school
(10 years ago) the general swirl of opinion was that 
P=NP, and that this would be proved for certain within a 
few years.

Guess it hasn't happend yet. :)

In any case, I recall an NSA employee telling me that
NSA doesn't make use of RSA.  Clearly, if you are hyperparanoid
about security, you are not going to use a system whose
integrity depends on an unsolved mathematical problem
that everybody is working on....

I knew that the li(x) function and pi(x) changed signs... did not know 
that it had been proven that x/ln(x) < pi(x) (for big x).

(actually, one can get the difference between x/ln(x) and li(x) as an 
integral.... and if one has a good enough bound on the differnce between 
li(x) and pi(x) I can see how one might get a proof that x/ln(x)-pi(x) 
has constant sign for sufficiently large x)

Of course the values of x for which the problems occur (change of sign 
for li(x)-pi(x), for example) are so large that is pretty inconceivable 
that they would ever occur in practice.

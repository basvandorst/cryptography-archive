Forgive me, if that has been mentioned here before, but I'm new to this 
group, and to public key cryptography as well.  The problem is,
I have been browsing thru some text files about RSA, when I came across this:
(edited for clarity)

    m=(p-1)(q-1)=40
    Pick E and d so that Ed = 1 mod (m):
                         E = 3, d = 27

The "mod" used above does not seem to be the "ordinary" modulus function, 
sine 1 mod 40 (or 1 % 40, if you prefer) = 1, and not 81.  What is it then?

]The only sciences that use numbers like the crypto-heads are astronomy and
]cosmology.  While they use orders of magnitude, the crypto-heads are using
]integers of the same orders of magnitude.

Other complexity theory people also use big numbers.  The difference
is that algorithm folks say things like
"Rats!  That would take about age-of-the-universe seconds to calculate."
while crypto people say things like
"Great! That would take about age-of-the-universe seconds to calculate.
Let's make the keys longer!"

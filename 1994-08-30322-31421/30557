Probably not. I'd guess it uses the same algorithm as Word, which is
pretty hopeless - basically it just XORs a repeating pattern on top
of the data, and there are standard methods of breaking that sort
of encryption. I'd suggest getting PGP or a DES program off of the
net if you want to keep it secure.

P.S. The fact that Microsoft can export Excel would tend to imply
that the encryption isn't much good, wheter it uses the same
algorithm or not.

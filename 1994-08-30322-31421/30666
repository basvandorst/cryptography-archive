I've recently read Bruce Schneier's "Applied Cryptography", and decided to
experiment with some of the code examples in the back of the book.  I typed
in the Enigma simulation, and got it to work encrypting and decrypting my
own files.  But I found two problems:

I cannot understand how the ring setting adjustment works.  When I put in
some debug code to look at the rotor permutations, it seemed to me that,
except for the rings in the base 'AAA' or '1 1 1' position, that the rule
that the rotors should be reversible was broken.  I.e. that if E in gave R
out going one way, then R in did not give E out going back.  Can I get at
some example Enigma crypts to check against?

Also, I tried to decrypt a sample of Enigma cipher (with key settings)
given in a Cryptologia article (in a book form collection).  I tried every
interpretation of the given key that I could think of, but I couldn't
decrypt the sample.  Is there more to it than this?  Different types of
Enigma machine (neither the example nor the code specify a machine type)?

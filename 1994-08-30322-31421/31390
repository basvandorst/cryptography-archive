I have always encouraged those who don't wish to read my posts to put me in
their kill files. I don't take offense. People should feel free to ignore
anyone they want here, for any reason, or even no reason.

This writer, however, is up to some ego game, as can be seen by his use of
the word "squelched" as well as his final remark.

This is a gross distortion of what I said, confirming the implication in
"squelched" that you're posting with malice. I said that answers should be
consistent with the phrasing of the question, not that they should treat
laymen as "helpless slugs". If a questioner can handle (for example)
Carmichael numbers, by all means go for it. But if it's not clear he can,
then at least a little throat clearing is in order before dumping highly
mathematical material on him. To use the arcana of a professional field in
response to what is an obvious layman's question is an exercise in
self-gratification, not a conversation.

By the way, so you know where I am coming from, I have a Ph.D. in
mathematical economics. I am not writing as a member of the unwashed asking
for dumbing down, but as a professional who knows where simple politeness
and consideration is warranted, and who recognizes the use of fancy
verbiage for self-aggrandizement rather than informing a questioner, when he
sees it.

Another confirmation that you are posting maliciously, rather than as part
of this community trying to forward the action. Why not do your
self-gratification in private so you won't embarass yourself. Not everyone
thinks getting one's rocks off in public is one of the social graces.

Who says people are offended by the SUBSTANCE of Your scientifically based
analyses it is the way you your criticism personal that is the cause
of complaint.

If you do not understand by now I fear you never will.


Anyway I think that people are unlikely to want to hear anymore of this.

So if I wanted absolute safety it could be guaranteed?

Would you stake your life on it?

Would you stake the life of every American on it?

Surely that depends upon whether or not someone somewhere has found a method
of cracking RSA so fast that the timescale limitation is meaningless.

That was what an expert told the German High Command about enigma. Why
should anyone believe this analysis?

I will email you privately on these because they are spin offs from 
sci.crypt and I want to make sure that I am not taking up band
width that others may regard as "off topic".

In regard to the how safe is RSA question?


Let us say someone was asked to prepare an analysis in response to the
questions "How safe is RSA"


Under what sub headings do you think the analysis  should be made?

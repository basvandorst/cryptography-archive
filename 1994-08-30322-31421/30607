This is the DESX algorithm invented by RSADSI but recently
placed in the public domain.  (The algorithm, not the code.)
An independently developed C implementation of this can be
found on the non-anonymous FTP server ripem.msu.edu.
DESX is just DES with some XORing before and after to expand
the keyspace.

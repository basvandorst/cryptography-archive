As I said in posting starting this thread, it's impossible to patent IDEA
in EU. you can patent every black-box system doing this system, but Computers
aren't black boxes, so no program usind IDEA is patentabele at least in Germany
and as John states for UK, there too.
And, If you patent such a cryptobox, you can wrote a simulator for any computer
doing same thing without infrigating the patent.

Yup, And I hope such patent-bombs like they are able in US will gone forever
and US is moving himself to more civil laws.

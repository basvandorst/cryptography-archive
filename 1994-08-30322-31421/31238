Actually sometimes I like easy questions, since those are the only ones I 
can write something on. :)

As I've outlined in another post, there may be 3.2*10^74 primes between 
2^255 and 2^256.  I am rather nerdy these days, and haven't read newspaper 
for a long time (like, years), so please enlighten me on when was the last 
time human population on Earth exceeded that number. :)

(If someone really gets that lucky to have the same modulus as some other 
people, then, well, tell them to buy lottery! :)  (Seriously, good luck to 
them.)

Bruce Schneier asks:
  Can anyone help me with information about ISO/IEC 9979


I have two copies of this standard (one printed by ISO and one printed
 by BSI, the UK standards body. The covers are different, but the text
is identical). I also have a copy of the register.

As the standard itself is copyrighted by ISO, I shouldn't really post
it's contents. However, to answer your questions I can summarise:

1. Origin

   ISO 9979 was developed by ISO/IEC JTC1 SC 27. It was a point
   project between ISO and the IEC (International Electrotechnical
   Commission). The ITU (aka CCITT) was not involved in the development
   of this standard, unlike (say) X.509, which was a joint project
   between ISO, IEC and ITU.

   SC 27 is concerned with ``security techniques''. Other SC 27 projects
   include specification of non-repudiation mechanisms, and the
   standardisation of various hash functions. Note that ISO has agreed
   not to standardise hash functions (after a strange and unexplained
   incident when it attempted to make DEA-1 an International Standard).

   Within ISO, one-way hash functions are (by definition) not
   cryptographic algorithms, and so ISO considers itself permitted to
   standardise them. On the other hand, cryptographic algorithms can
   only be registered, not standardised. The difference between
   standardisation and registration here is that standardisation
   involves the technical content of the standard being approved by a
   majority of ISO member bodies, while registration does not involve
   any such approval.

   The BSI edition of 9979 gives a list of the organisations that were
   represented on the UK commitee (IST 33) that decided which way the
   UK should vote on this standard.

   These are:

   Association for Payment Clearing Services
   Bull HN Information Systems Ltd.
   CCTA (Covernment Center for Information Systems)
   Department of Trade and Industry (IT standards Unit)
   GCHQ (CESG)
   IBM United Kingdom Ltd.
   International Computers Limited
   Rank Xerox Ltd.

2. Date of approval

   It's full title is ISO/IEC 9979:1991, with the 1991 meaning that it
   was approved in 1991. It is very common for there to be a long gap
   between a standard being approved and it actually becoming available
   to the public --- the process of typesetting and printing takes ages.

   The BSI edition only became available a few months ago (I got fed up
   waiting for it and obtained the ISO edition). The BSI edition states
   that it came into effect of 15 May 1994.

3. Who keeps the register

   The standard itself does not state who keeps the register. This means
   that people who want to consult the register are left at a loss as
   to what to do.

   In fact, the register is kept by the National Computer Center in the UK.
   
   The contact person is:
   Chris Hook
   National Computer Centre Ltd
   Oxford Road
   Manchester
   M1 7ED
   United Kingdom
   Telephone: +44 61 228 6333

   A list of which algorithms have been registered is available free.
   The full details of each register entry cost 15 UK pounds per
   register entry. As I'll explain later, even the full register entry
   does not necessarily explain how the algorithm works.

4. Who controls what's on the register


   Only an ISO Member Body, an ISO technical committee or an organisation
   that has an official liaison with ISO ask for an algorithm to be
   registered. Private individials cannot do this. (Although they can
   talk to the relevant commitee of their national standards body
   and try to presuade them to ask for an algorithm to be registered).
   Your milage may vary. I have been meaning to try this as an
   experiment.

   There may also be some undocumented aspects to this process. For
   example, it has been alleged that GCHQ (our local spook
   organisation) gets to see every register entry first, and can
   arrange for algorithms it doesn't like to be quietly forgotten about.
   I will not comment as to whether or not there is any truth in this
   rumour.

5. What's on the register

   This section reproduces the summary of the register that's available
   free of charge. Unlike the standard itself, this summary doesn't have
   any copyright notices on it (however, it can still be considered
   copyright material even without them). As this summary is available
   free of charge, I'm not depriving anyone of revenue by reproducing it.

    Brief Description of Algorithm:
      B-CRYPT is designed for use in communication and computer security
      products. The exact details of the algorithm will not be generally
      published.

      B-CRYPT is designed by BT Cryptographic Products to provide privacy
      in a wide use of telecommunications services using a block mode
      transmission protocol. In particular it can be used in digital
      terminals for telephony and data, communicating office products,
      and in securing network management. The device produces a sequence
      of 64-bit blocks of pseudo-random bit-stream, suing a key and a 64
      bit initialisation vector. Key variables are of 64 bits, formatted
      with every eigth bit represnting even parity for the previous
      seven. Normally the device operates in the Addiitive Stream Cipher
      mode.

    Other information:
      B-CRYPT has been implemented in 2 micron CMOS technology and
      operates in excess of 20Mbits per second.

5.2 IDEA

    ISO Entry Name: ISO 9979/0002

    Name of Algorithm: IDEA (tm)

    Sponsoriing Authority:
      Schweizerische Normen Verinigung (SNV), Muhlebachstrasse 54,
      CH-8008 Zurich Switzerland

    Registration Requested By:
      Ascom Tech. ltd. PO Box 151, CH-4502 Solothurn, Switzerland

    Contact for Information:
      Teodor Bruggemann, Ascom Tech Ltd.

    Date Submitted: 21 April 1993

    Date Registered: 10 May 1993

    Intended Range of Applications
      1. Confidentiality (e.g. using modes of operation detailed in
         ISO 8372)
      2. Entity Authentication (e.g. as detailed in ISO 9798-2)
      3. Date Integrity/data origin Authentication (e.g. as detailed
         in ISO 9797)
      4. Hashing (e.g. as detailed in ISO 10117-2)
      5. Key Management (e.g. as detailed in ISO 11770-2)

    Brief description of algorithm:

      The block cipher algorithm IDEA(tm) operates with 64-bit plaintext and
      ciphertext blocks and is controlled by a 128-bit key. The
      cryptographic design of this algorithm is based on the use of
      operations from three different algebraic groups. The algorithm
      structure has been chosen so that, with the exception that
      different key sublocks are used, the encryption process is
      identical to the decryption process.

      As a 64-bit block cipher algorithm IDEA(tm) can be used in any mode
      of operation defined in ISO 8372 and ISO 10116.

    Other information:

      The IDEA(tm) was specifically designed to be resistant to the recently
      developed differential cryptanalysis technique.

      IDEA(tm) was designed to allow easy and efficient software
      implementation. However, it has alos successfully been implemented
      in hardware. The current version of the chip is capable of
      encrypting of decrypting data in various modes and at very high
      speeds of up to 170 MB/s.

    National Standard:

    Patent License Restriction:

      World-wide patent applied for. may be implemented and distributed
      as Freeware or Shareware, as long as Ascom Tech Ltd. is clearly
      stated as the proprietor on every copy. However, for commercial
      use of IDEA(tm) a license and fee is required.

6. What should a register entry contain

    Actual register entries are shown above. According to the standard,
    a register entry should contain the following:

     (mandatory information)

     1. ISO entity name
         An object identifier of the form
         {iso standard 9979 algortithm-identifier(n)} where n is the
         number of the register entry

     2. proprietry name (or names) of algorithm

     3. intended range of applications
        e.g. confidentiality; authentication; data integrity; digital
        signatures; hash functions

     4. cryptographic interface parameters
        e.g. input size; output size; key length; initialising value size;
        encrypt of decrypt mode

     5. set of check words to check basic functionality

     6. organisation that requested registration

     7. date of registration and modifications

     8. whther the subject of a national standard

     9. patent license restrictions

     (optional information)

     10. references to any associated algorithms
          These are intended to be references to ISO standards, ITU
           recommendations or national standards, and should be
           in the form required by the ISO Directives.

     11. description of the algorithm

     12, modes of operation
           e.g. Electronic Code Book; Cipher Feedback; Cipher Block
            Chaining; Output Feedback; Additive Stream Cipher;
            Black Box

     13. other infomation
           e.g. design criteria; cryptographic strength; suitability
           for specific applications; transmission characteristics;
           recommendations for key selection

          
7. Object Identifiers

    The following object id is used as the prefix for cryptographic
    algorithm algorithm identifiers:
     {iso standard 9979}

    The following object id is used as the prefix for mode of operation
    algorithm identifiers:
    id-MOP OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {iso registration-authority 
       cryptographic-algorithms(?) 1}

    The standard itself has a ? for the second to last component i.e at
    the time of publication, its value had not been assigned. In addition,
    the ASN.1 used in the standard to define it contains several
    errors.

    identifiers for specific modes of operation are assigned as follows:

    id-MOP-eelctronic-code-book ID ::= {id-MOP 0}
    id-MOP-cipher=feedback ID ::= {id-MOP 1}
    id-MOP-cipher-block-chaining ::= {id-MOP 2}
    id-MOP-output-feedback ::= {id-MOP 3}
    id-MOP-additive-stream-cipher ::= {id-MOP 4}

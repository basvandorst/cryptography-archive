CFS employs a user-level NFS server running on the workstation's loopback
interface.

Most of the interesting file system work in Unix seems to take this approach
these days; set up the code to use NFS, and one doesn't have to hack the
kernel.  It's a much better approach; it's quick, easy, and mostly portable.

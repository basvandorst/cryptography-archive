I goofed. The noise transistor develops about 100mV of noise.
At all stages of amplification and filtering I closely observed the 
signal on my scope with line (60 Hz) triggering. No pattern was 
observable. That's good enough by me. Maybe not good enough by you?
My low-level frequency components should be above the corner freq of the 
filter, i.e., about 5KHz. When I hook up a frequency counter to it, it 
reads roughly 4700 Hz. Perhaps you mean low-frequency components? I want 
a min frequency of about 1KHz (i.e., a period of 1mS) to preserve 
randomness at a 4mS sample rate.
I may mail you with questions on testing...

I am being requested by a local club, to try to recover some of 
their club records which were previously kept by a club member, 
who later got angry, and returned them encrypted :-)  I understand
the guy who encrypted them is not too bright, and is not a programmer,
so he undoubtedly is relying upon some commonly available encryption
method.  

Do the common encryption methods, such as some of the compression &
encryption programs, have something which makes it identifiable (i.e.
a signiture of sorts?).  What are the more common encryption programs
out there, that a normal John Q. Public would get at his local compter
store, and do they have any tell-tale traits which can be identified
to determine which one he used?   

I don't have the files in hand yet, but will be receiveing them
shortly.  Any suggestions on attacking this would be helpful.

Thanks

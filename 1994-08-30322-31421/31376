I hate to correct myself, but better I do than error remain... forget 
using another "a" with non zero components... just minus one (the point 
is that for the odd prime factors, with summand Z(2^u), as (-1)^2=1, the 
component is 2^([u-1])... if we have two summands, Z(2^u)+Z(2^v) consider 
the homomorphism (since x divisible by 2^u implies 2^(v-u)x divisible by 
2^v) from Z(2^u)+Z(2^v) to Z(2^u)+Z(2^v) given by (a,b)-->(a,b-a*2^(v-u)) 
where (2^(u-1),2^(v-1))-->(2^(u-1),0) (killing the term with the higher 
order)... for the factors of 2^n, noting that -1 has a component in the 
Z(2) permits an isomorphism Z(2)+Z(2^v)->Z(2)+Z(2^v) of 
(a,b)->(a,b-a*2^(v-1)) and (1,2^(v-1))->(1,0)

however it depends upon the fact that (-1)^2=1 (that is, the component in 
any Z(2^v) summand is either zero or 2^(v-1)) (and as -1<>1, at least one 
component is non zero.. so we can reduce to the smallest)

But for arbitrary a, one cannot always move the result to the smallest 
power (need that the non-zero terms have coeff. 0 or 2^(v-1) in Z(2^v) 
which works for -1... eg... cannot find an isomorphism from Z2+Z4 to 
Z2+Z4 that changes (1,1) to (1,0) or (0,0) for then (1,1) would have to 
have order 1 or 2, but has order 4... CAN do it to move (1,2) to (1,0) , 
but (1,2) has order 2)

So forget the comments on an arbitrary a... though it does work for -1 
(since (-1)^2=1) (luckily it only need work for -1!)

(I hate it when my subconscious makes errors like that and I do not 
notice them till my conscious has already acted on them... it is my 
subconcsious that actually noticed the error... but too late!)

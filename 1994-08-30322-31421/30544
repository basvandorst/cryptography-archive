Oh sod that for a lark. Much cheaper to dunk the chip in rather strong nitric
acid for a bit to soften the expoxy. if nitric does not work assay the resin
to determine what the original solvent was and apply that. Few things do not
dissolve in Oleum. Of course you would probably prefer not to dissolve the chip
as well but this has not been a problem in the past :-)

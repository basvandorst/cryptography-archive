Yes...almost all releases of PGP (I'm not going to look at my 1.0
to see if it is there :)

The term is one Zimmermann coined for 1024 bit RSA keys.

Yes.

The military has more goals than just security.  For example, the NSA - the
mandated suplier of all military (and now civilian(??) :(  crypto wants to
make sure only certain modes of use are available...ie they control the
kinds of keys you can use.  This to make sure no one is doing stuff on their
own and, maybe :), so that they can always read the traffic.

Indeed, many argue the level of security provided by PGP exceeds much of
that used today by the military.  (See the Walker spy trial for some
interesting nuggets of info.)

Bigger keys mean exponentially increasing difficulty in breaking the cypher.

No, every user of PGP has 1024 bit keys available to them.  The Friends of Big
Brother would like to limit keysize and encryption methods, etc, but, until
they get the Digital Telephony Bill through Congress, we still live in the
Land of the Free.

We were all nubies sometime.

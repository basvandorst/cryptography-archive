Good arguments can be made that no finite sequence can be considered
to be "random." But for a discussion of these issues, I like Ming Li
and Paul Vitanyi's "An Introduction to Kolmogoroff Complexity and its
Applications," 1993, Springer-Verlag.

They also have no discussion of crypto, disappointingly. But Charles
Bennett of IBM has applied the work of Kolmogoroff, Chaitin, etc., to
crypto, especially as regards "logical depth."

Gregory Chaitin, also of IBM, has done a lot of work on measures of
complexity and randomness for finite strings.

For example, a finite string is "random" if it has no shorter
description than itself. (But one can _never prove_ that a supposed
short description is the shortest. For example, a "seemingly random"
sequence or string may actually have a very short description, if one
is sufficiently clever. The connection to crypto is pretty clear: a
seemingly random (high entropy) string actually is quite regular,
saying "Buy Apple.")

Descriptive complexity, aka Kolmogoroff-Chaitin complexity, is I think
what you want.

A useful intro is in Tom Cover's books on information theory.

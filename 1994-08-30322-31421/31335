>sci.crypt is not research.crypto.advanced.

Yes it is; at least, there is no "research.crypto.advanced" because
that's what sci.crypt is supposed to be for. All "sci" newsgroups are
intended for people who have at least some idea what they're talking
about.

Actually, I don't suppose that people would get so peeved at posts from
people who don't know, if they at least knew that they didn't know. 
I'm probably the most ignorant of the regular posters to this group;
practically my sole knowledge of crypto comes from this group, apart
from the PGP docs, a glance at the crypto part of Denning's
undergraduate text, a read of the IDEA paper, and the back of
"Introduction to Algorithms" where they describe RSA.  I've never been
flamed by Bob Silverman because I've some idea of how far my ignorance
constrains me from making pronouncements about the strength of RSA.

True: all the way from Iberia to the Urals.

Also true.

Ah, no.  The only "European Law" is that of the EU; this construction is
the same as "The European Court" or the "European Currency Unit."

Really?  References, please.

Mmm.  Isn't this a rather childish argument to authority?

The RSA patent is framed in such a way as to describe a machine which
performs the algorithm.  This is common in algorithm patents; The RSA
patent descibes a bunch of discrete logic to do this.  A patent can
describe a computer, read only memory, et cetera, and then describe
the process of computation.  This trick has been used in UK and other
European patents.

It's not logical to say "You can't use the RSA algorithm to encrypt
data becase it's covered by a patent" and then say "The RSA patent
isn't an algorithm patent."

An "algorithm patent" is a patent which gives a monopoly on the use of
an algorithm to the owners of that patent.  It doesn't matter how the
patent is framed: if the RSA patent prevents non-licencees from using
the RSA algorithm, then it's an algorithm patent.

In arguing this, it's just occurred to me that perhaps we have
different definitions of what an "algorithm patent" is.

But there is a crucial difference between a process patent and an
algorithm patent; the former transforms matter in some way, the latter
does not.

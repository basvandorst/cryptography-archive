Neural nets are not likely to do well with modern ciphers (e.g., RSA,
IDEA, DES, etc.), mainly because of the shape of the solution space.

Instead of the "rolling hills and valleys" that neural nets (and
related methods, such as genetic algorithms, simulated annealing,
etc.) do well in, the solution space for modern ciphers offers very
little in the way of "learning" opportunities: you either have the
solution (the key), or you don't.

Think of a needle standing up from a flat plain...a NN or any other
hill-climber could wander for years and never find it.

I suspect there are uses in peripheral aspects, such as guessing
passwords (when people have not picked high-entropy passwords, but
have instead used familiar names). Or in traffic analysis.

But the move in modern cryptology is definitely away from using
anything with "structure" that can be learned. Put another way, neural
nets and such work well in structured environments, where there's
something to _learn), but not in the high-entropy, seemingly random
world of encrypted data.

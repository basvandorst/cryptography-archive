It's been pointed out that a transcription error I made when
typing in my previous posting made one paragraph nonsensical. My
apologies! What I meant to say was:

   Note that ISO has agreed
   not to standardise cryptographic algorithms (after a strange and unexplained
   incident when it attempted to make DEA-1 an International Standard).

   Within ISO, one-way hash functions are (by definition) not
   cryptographic algorithms, and so ISO considers itself permitted to
   standardise them.

(Mind you, the concept is still pretty bizarre even with the typing error
corrected...)

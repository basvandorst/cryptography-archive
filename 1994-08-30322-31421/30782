As far as I remember, there were two crypto options in the GSM standard:
one a DES-quality (ie: fairly secure) type, and the second (much weaker)
option had a much shorter keylength...
The weaker option was for sale to govts who requested it or were barred from
receiving strong crypto by COCOM regs.

Funnily enough - most of europe also chose the weaker version of the
crypto standards.  I know that in Norway the security forces ("Your friend
with a large budget") specifically demanded ^H^H^H^H^H^H^Hrequested 
the weaker crypto standard be implemented by the phone co.

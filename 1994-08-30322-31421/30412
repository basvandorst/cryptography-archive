No it didn't.  He persists in confusing the law of the European
*continent*, which simply doesn't exist, with the law of the European
*Union* (nee European Community), which does exist, and which excludes
Switzerland.

He replied to a statement specifically about European Union law by an
example in Swiss law.  That's about as relevant as trying to show a
counterexample to US federal law, by quoting Canada because it's in the
same continent.

He has done that before, been corrected and acknowledged the correction,
but still repeats it.

Sure "European law" might appear ambiguous as might "American law".  But
would anybody in the US *really* think that the latter meant the law of the
American continent, and included Canada, etc.  "European law" means and
*only* means the law of the European Union.

United Kingdom law, which *is* part of the EU, specifically excludes from
patent law (amongst other things):

  Computer programs.
  A scheme, rule or method for performing a mental act.
  A scheme, rule or method for playing a game or doing business.
  Mathematical methods.

I find it inconceivable that the RSA algorithm (or system, or whatever else
one would like to call it) could have been patented here even were it
previously unpublished.

I understand that Germany takes a similar view of patentability, as does
most of the EU.  Part of the EU initiative is of course to harmonise the
member countries' laws.

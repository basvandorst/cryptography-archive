Most of the programs fore sale outside of the USA have weak encryption to 
avoid those nasty export restrictions (if we outlaw encryption, only 
outlaws will have encryption).
  
That is why programs such as WPcrak.zip (WordPerfect password cracker) have 
been so successful.  Many of the other word processors such as Word have 
also been broken for the same reason.

There must be an OS/2 password cracker, all you have to do is find it!

Using DH as Paul suggested does not require per-session interaction,
and Paul's requirement that all users share a common base and modulus
is unnecessary.  Alice publishes a, n, a^x mod n and keeps x secret.
Bob can then choose some y and send Alice a^y mod n followed by a
message encrypted with a conventional algorithm using (a hash of ?)
a^(xy) mod n as the key.

I don't know whether a black box which computes f(z)=z**x mod n
provides an easy way to find x.  This is not a problem though, since
Alice has no reason to reveal what she gets by raising the quantity
provided as a**y to her secret x.

The reason to be unhappy if handed 0 or 1 is that Alice knows the
sender failed to keep the session key secret.

: (After all, they don't really have to find y such that a**y = 2, 
: they can just hand you a 2...)

In fact if they do know y and a**y then they can find a**(xy) without
Alice.

The fundamental difference is that block ciphers work on a block of data 
at a time, where a block is typically 8 bytes; this is inconvenient
for some kinds of data, which want to ship each bit or byte as soon as
it's generated.  Voice transmission at low bit rates is often picky about it.
Stream cyphers let you encrypt things a bit or byte at a time; they
typically work by generating a cryptographically strong stream of bits
which you XOR with the plaintext, though there are other approaches.
Block cyphers can be turned into stream cyphers, and I suppose vice versa.

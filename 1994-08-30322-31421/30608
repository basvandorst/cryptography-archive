The prior message (only use primes that divide LCM(p-1,q-1) and test to 
see of the LCM is a divisor) was to indicate how one could come up with a 
workable, inefficient method... in general, unless you have factored 
n=pq, you do not know p-1,q-1 and so use all the primes... even less 
efficient, but workable for decoding all messages for which the largest 
prime factor of o_n(x) is less than 2^K... and is totally inefficient, 
BUT does *not* require factoring n!

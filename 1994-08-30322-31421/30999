the study of foreign languages after the acquisition of our own is undoubtedly
one of the most interesting and agreeable which can occupy the time of
literary persons or engage the attention of those who are desirous of presenting
themselves in society as objects of a polite and accomplished education.
	the spanish language which yields to none in elegance expression
or strength has now become by reason of commercial treaties recently
established with south america as necessary and important to british
youth as it is instructive and entertaining to the learned by reason of
the infinite number of works which in all times and on all subjects
have been written notwithstanding the trammels of the inquisition by men
of genius in that once eminent but now unfortunate country

It has been seen that every good cryptographic system combines two
more or less separate and distinct elements a basic or unchangeable
method or process, which is termed the general system; and a specific
or variable factor which controls the steps under the general system
and is termed the specific key x the secrecy of any military cryptographic
system must be entirely dependent on the specific key because it
must be assumed that the enemy is in full possession of all the details
concerning the general systemX This assumption is warranted by the whole
history of military cryptography and is based upon the two following
considerations which all experienced cryptanalysts regard as validx
	in t(J5+%Ist place in military cryptography there are more prolific
sources from which to obtain information concerning cryptographic methods
than there are in isolated methods used by private individualsX in fact
by one means or another the enemy can sooner or later come into
possession of full information regarding the general cryptographic
systemX in the second place within a very short time the number of
messages available for study becomes so great and the inevitable
blunders in the handling of communications have become so numerous
that a solution by detailed study can always be made by the enemy
with a consequent disclosure of the general system.

   Forget the tea leaves, grab a
dowsing rod.<
   The ancient art of dowsing can help predict the future,
discover past lives and even allow people to communicate with
animals, according to enthusiasts gathered in Santa Cruz, Calif., a liberal
seaside town with a reputation as a counterculture mecca.<
   ``Whatever you want to know, you can dowse for,'' said Rose
Rozga, one of about three hundred people at a weekend dowsing convention
at the University of California at Santa Cruz.<

   ``I use it when I'm buying cosmetics. I ask if there's
anything in the product I'm allergic to,'' she said.<
   Dowsers from the United States, Canada and Australia
attended the convention of the American Association of Dowsers.
The group claims about six thousand members in forty one countries.<
   Dowsing rods, traditionally used to find underground water,
used to be made from Y-shaped willow branches. Modern rods are
made from nylon tubing. A dowser asks the rod a question,
watching for slight movements or bends. If the rod points
skyward the answer is no; downward means yes.<
 
 
 
third of three parts
   In addition to the traditional pursuit of water, the
convention offered such classes as ``Dowsing and Past Lives''
and ``Inter-species Communication.''<
   ``Don't worry if you don't understand this stuff,'' master
dowser Tony Gehringer told students. ``You're going to learn
how to work these things and maybe you'll understand it later.
Or maybe you won't.''<
 
outhouses
   It's easy to find Hy Goldenberg's
home: Just look for the row of outhouses.<
   He started collecting them thirty years ago while he was
building a house on the banks of the Wabash River. His land was
in an isolated spot, so Goldenberg gave a friend money to buy
an outhouse that carpenters could use while they were working
on the house.<
   ``He came back with two, and if you have two of anything,
you have a collection,'' Goldenberg said.<
   The number grew to twelve over the years, and each is different.<
   ``I think they are a strong piece of Americana that nobody
thinks about,'' Goldenberg said.<
   When Goldenberg made it known he would be moving and
auctioning off his collection to museums, people protested.<
   Friends complained that without the outhouses, Huntington's
dual claim to fame as the home of former Vice President Dan
Quayle and Hy Goldenberg's outhouses would be gone as well.<
   Even his kids were upset.<
   ``My kids said, `Dad, you can't do that. They belong to the
public,''' Goldenberg said.<
   He said his daughter has promised to maintain the
collection.<

There you go..... the final listing }iis actually sample No. 2 but i
had a hard time remembering the name of the file! (regarding sample
message No. 1... I posted it long ago from an article in Cryptologia).....
and thought I'd keeping numbering the same.

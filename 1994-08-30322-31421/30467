Outer space.

Simply launch a satellite into geo orbit, which is programmed to
receive transmissions containing the private key (wrapped with a
second key held by the user).  At the defined future point in
time, the satellite broadcasts the wrapped private key down to a
groundstation, from which it can be furnished to the user, who
can then unwrap it and use it.

Compromising the system would involve physically accessing
a satellite in high orbit, which is unlikely in the first place,
plus one could make the satellite tamper-proof.  If this isn't
good enough, one could go deep-space rather than earth-orbit.

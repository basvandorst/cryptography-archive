Well, the original message I have in this thread is
<31g63k$989@zeus.rbi.informatik.uni-frankfurt.de> from Ralf Zessin
<zessin@helena.rbi.informatik.uni-frankfurt.de>.  This has been my thread
root for some time, and contains no back references, either in the header
or by context.  It refers to the European Community, *not* to Europe
generally, so I don't think it's me that is being "blatantly false".

    "Hi folks, as Subject says, RSA and other krypto-algorithms
    are not patentable in Europeen Community. Since we know that
    Algorithm we can use it as we want. However, if we want to
    distribute a software containing such patented material to USA
    we have a problem.
    But it will be nice to distribute messages undecrytable by NSA,
    or thinking on Germany, BND and similar."

There is no "European Law" except that of the European Union.  It has its
own legislature and courts.

There is a European *continent*, as there is a North American continent.
However neither have any *legal* significance.  (You don't seem to have
grasped that your dismissive comments about "American" being the adjective
of the USA rather than the North American continent is *precisely* the
analogy I was drawing.)

European political institutions are undergoing continuing change, and the
political union formed as a result of the Treaty of Maastricht is perhaps
not yet well understood.  It establishes common law, citizenship, rights,
etc, over a large part, but not all, of the European continent.  As this
treaty has only been ratified by the countries concerned last year, it is
understandable if US public opinion has not yet adjusted to the
consequences.

Please understand than when an European use the word "European" (and you
are commenting both originally and immediately on articles written by
Europeans), he is more likely, and *always* in matters of law or
citizenship, to mean the European Union not the European continent.

If you are relying on knowledge gained at that time, you are, I regret,
sadly out of date.  The Treaty of Maastricht, signed in '92 and ratified in
'93, created the Union and common citizenship and law, and has produced a
*significant* shift, and not a little heart-searching.

And, BTW, European law means the law as enacted by the European Parliament
and Commission, and as administered by the European Courts.  These are
*specific* institutions independent of any member country, and definititely
not vague collectives of the European countries.

I don't understand the relevance of the "Wogs begin at Calais" comments as
a reply to my asserting the United Kingdom and Germany now being parts of a
larger European Union.  I hope it doesn't presage a descent into insults as
an alternative to debate.

UK law, and as far as I know other EU law, makes a strong distinction
between abstract, mental, rules and procedures (such as the examples I
quoted), and physical things like chemical refineries.

I have written an encryption program for the mac that is for
the completely paranoid person.  It encrypts a file and then hides
the encrypted data in a sound.  Below is a description of the
encryption process.  I would like some feedback on how hard
it would be to break, and how it could be improved.
 
1: get 2 passwords from user (ask them for at least 18 chars)
2: take MD5 hash of password 1, call this K1 (128 bits)
3: take MD5 hash of password 2, split into K2 & K3 (64 bits each)
4. encrypt file with K1 using IDEA, make cyphertext 1
5. using DES pcbc, encrypt cyphertext 1 with K2, make cyphertext 2
6. using DES pcbc, decrypt cyphertext 2 with K3, make cyphertext 3
7. using DES pcbc, encrypt cyphertext 3 with K2, make cyphertext 4
8. store cyphertext 4 in lowest bits of a sound.
 
How hard is it to detect if the lowest (LSB) of a sound has
encrypted data, or if it is just normal static from A to D
conversion?  The sound sounds the same after adding data.
 
If anyone would like a copy of the program, please e-mail me.
You must be a US citizen to legally have this.

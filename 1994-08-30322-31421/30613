: If you wish to write a zero and the LSB in the original sample is 0, leave it.
: If you wish to write a zero and the LSB in the original sample is 1, add 1.
: If you wish to write a one  and the LSB in the original sample is 0, add 1.
: If you wish to write a one  and the LSB in the original sample is 1, leave it.

Sorry for the stupidity, next time I will think for 30 seconds
before asking questions like that.
 
It works fine, as long as the sound level isn't at max.  Just add an 
extra check.  If its 255 (or 65536 for 16 bit), you can't add one, 
otherwise you get nice clicks in the sound.

BTW: Does anyone know of a good way to distribute a program that can't
be exported?

Why is this a problem?  Posts to sci.crypt an sci.crypt.research are 
international, anyway.  They normally consist of academic discussions and 
such things as are protected in the USA under the First Amendment of the 
US Constitution, which is a higher law than the ITAR.

Of course, if someone outside the USA wants to post a complete crypto
application, then it would be good to have a submission address outside of
the USA.  Perhaps two parallel submission addresses would make sense --
one outside the USA and one inside.

Okay, after reading the article on the RSA129 crack,
I would like to know what the group or the leader of that effort 
feels is now needed to break military grade RSA based their 
experiment.

After all the real prize lies in breaking the military grade code
which is > 10^15 times larger and a whole new ballgame.

Yes I know that breaking RSA may not require factoring, but keep 
this thread pure to the factoring idea.

The military and political posibilities for the cracking
of military grade RSA are astounding. One could wage "war"
by liquidating the accounts of foreign countries, mafia, 
political rivals, or more as those numbers were transfered
in seemingly secure messages.

Nations could set rival nations at war with each other by
forging messages and thentake them when they were burying
the dead. It is really scary....

Will the information superhighway ever be safe if anyone
could break such numbers, no...

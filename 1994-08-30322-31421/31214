Huh?  I may be confused - I am quite a bit.  But I thought that if you
could solve one NP-complete problem at a given order, then you could
solve all of them.  Solving an NP-complete problem in polynomial time
sounds kind of oxymoronic being that NP stands for Non-Polynomial.  But
then I may have missed a couple of exceptions.  If there are I would
be very interested in references.

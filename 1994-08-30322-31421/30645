I'm still not clear if you're "deducing" that it wouldn't be patentable or
if you're making a statement as a patent attorney with full knowledge of the
format of the RSA patent and the IDEA patent in Switzerland and the U.S.

That's why I suggest the question is not what someone thinks, but whether
ASCOM AG has, or has applied for EU patents.

Still waiting for an answer from someone who might KNOW, rather than people
trying to speculate using their understanding of the thing.

I'm not being stubborn here, but we've had plenty of claims over that past
year about similar matters by people who were not expert, and who were
proved wrong in the event. Bright people tend to make it up as they go from
incomplete information by the use of simplistic syllogisms such as:

Computer programs are not patentable in the EU.
IDEA is a computer program.
IDEA is thus not patentable in the EU.

It turns out it may be more complex than that. For example:

Computer programs are not patentable in the US.
RSA is a computer program.
RSA is thus not patentable in the US.

The above is fallacious, and rather than examining the details of the
syllogism, a basically omphaloskeptic exercise, one merely can cite the RSA
patent number.

Arrgghh, not this again!  Despite the fact that in the entire history of
sci.crypt noone has ever had any problems posting articles, information, source
code, algorithm descriptions, and whatnot, and that exactly this same subject
came up in the RFD, people still complain about it.  The submission site will
be outside the US somewhere to avoid hassles with US export restrictions, but
based on the history of sci.crypt never having been troubled by these
restrictions before I don't think there'll be any problems.

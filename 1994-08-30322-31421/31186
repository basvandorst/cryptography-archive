Thank you; I think that understood the context.  (Though the original
questioner failed to read the FAQ.)  Without wanting to get into an
extended debate over it, I think that you gave a cryptographer's answer to
a question that (though a cryptography question) was stated in security
terms.  

The distinction is an important one.  When the cryptanalytic work factor
is sufficiently larger than the value of the data or the alternative cost
of obtaining it and when the elapsed time is sufficiently longer than the
life of the data, then, while still of cryptographic interest, they cease
to be of security interest.   The cost and elapsed time for cryptanalytic
attack against RSA are a function of the length of the modulus.  The
length of the modulus is arbitrary.  Therefore the cost and elapsed time
for attack are arbitrary, i.e., not of security interest.  

On the other hand, the value and life of the data are quite finite.  The
most valuable data is probably about keys, but still quite limited.  We
know of almost no secrets that need be kept much longer than three
generations.  (That is, a spy will die for his grandchildren but expects
his great-grandchildren to be so numerous and the resolve of his enemies
sufficiently weak that trying to protect them is futile.)

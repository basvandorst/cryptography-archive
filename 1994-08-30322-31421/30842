A man in the middle attack isn't the worst of it.

The two secret components in a Diffie-Hellman (or derivative) key exchange 
are known to all TSD 3600s, and there appears to be no mechanism for update
or change.  The physical security protection for the TSD 3600 appears to be 
minimal or nonexistant (FIPS Pub 140-1 security level 1 or 2).

Two questions arise:

Is it possible to monitor the internal function of a TSD 3600 to recover
components needed to recover negotiated session keys?

What assurances does AT&T provide as to the security of these components?

Take the theoretical case of a TSD 3600 that has had a hardware virus
added whose job it is to lie about the LEAF, preventing it from being
transmitted, and when in receipt of an IV from the Distant End (DE), load
the local IV/LEAF in, and use the save and restore context commands to
initialize with the DEs IV.

Law enforcement finds that it can't recover the session key, and approaches
AT&T for help, possibly with a warrant or court order.  There are a couple
of scenarios, one where they turn over enough information for LE to recover
the key from an exchange and one where they turn over a key that they 
recovered from the exchange.  The first scenario opens all TSD 3600 key 
exchanges to recovery.

The point being that using a TSD 3600 you are absolutely placing trust in
the manufacturer in a fashion analagous to using type I crypto with keys
supplied by NSA or its derivatives.  There is not one security hole but two.
Besides escrow access, man in the middle or man on the side attacks are 
possible only when in possession of key exchange security parameters.  It
would be nice if these were protected and changeable.

Whats needed is a private and trusted key exchange security parameter
certifying agency, and/or the ability to load your own keys.

       Two Research Posts in Cryptography and Computer Security

There are two vacancies for postdoctoral research assistants at Cambridge
University Computer Laboratory. These posts are attached to the Computer 
Security Group which is led by Professor Roger Needham.

Both are for research into the engineering aspects of cryptography, and are 
funded for two years. The first, which runs from 1st October 1994, is for 
work with Mark Lomas on trusted third party services; the second runs from 
1st January 1995, and is for work with Ross Anderson on the robustness of
cryptographic protocols.

Cambridge University is an equal opportunity employer. However there is not
enough time to arrange a work permit for the first of these positions, so
applicants for that post should not need one (that is, they should be UK
citizens, EU nationals, or persons who have the right of abode in the UK on
other grounds).

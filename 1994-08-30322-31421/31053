Things are even more complicated. Even if the general problem of 
factorization were rigorously proven to be "difficult", we still had
to identify the hard problem instances (to factor a power of to is
trivial ;-). 

PGP uses the product of exact two (probably) prime numbers as modulus.
At present this seems to be the hardest case for all known factoring 
algorithms, but the existence of an other algorithm to factor those 
products fast would not contradict the assumtion that the genral 
factoring problem is hard. 

A good example for this problem is the class of the NP-complete 
problems. In general these problems are believed to be hard, but for 
some of them there exist polynomial time algorithms to solve all but 
a negligible fraction of the problem instances.

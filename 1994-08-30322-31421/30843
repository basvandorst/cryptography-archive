First, I'll put on my asbestos suit just in case.

I just acquired a number of diskettes that contain a bunch of rather boring
Microsoft word for windows 2.0 documents.  Some of them have been encrypted
and although I have no use for any information in these files (I don't even
know their source) I'm curious whats there.
 
I remember there was a little program that did a neat job of figuring out
the password for encrypted Word Perfect 5.1 files.  (I actually used it to
rescue a friend's resume when she forgot the password.)  Is there such a
beastie for MSWORD?

Flames will be diverted to /dev/null.
 
Cheers,
     --Peter

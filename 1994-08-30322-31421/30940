OK, let me ask the dumb question.  What's wrong with extreme encryption,
or in other words, destruction of the data.  I mean something like a thermite
grenade built into the disk drive triggered with a panic button.

That still won't protect you from the brutal interrogator, he'll kill you
for destroying the data.  But it may protect the data.

yes, this is an excellent reference.  the first author was a neighbor of mine
years ago!  small world!

it is also well and good to point out to the community that there are a
lot of random-noise posts. what i feel is important to keep in mind is
that it does no good to sit back and simply remark on the lack of quality
of the posts - we know firsthand how easy it is for beginners etc. to get
onto a thread in their own language.  simply saying "wow, that was incredibly
wrong/funny/stupid" is of no help.  what these people (who are obviously
interested and often alert) _want_ is to be helped along.

the question asked in my original post which has not yet been well addressed
is "what are the details of the ss systems used in the 900 MHz cordless
phones." perhaps this was my fault for not having been clear enough.

whatever.

instead of offering any of this information, it appears that it is far easier
to insist that the well-meaning posters, who apparently didn't understand the
question well enough to be of succinct help, are to be "howled" at.  this does
no good.

i can imagine that if some poster who had concrete information to offer did
so, then any questions regarding basic terminology and introductory material
could be referred to at the time they were asked.  give the interested the
benefit of the doubt and move constructively to address the issue.

how about providing the interested among us with some concrete information
which directly gets to the point of the original post: details on the 900MHz
ss phones.

	1) spreading code generation scheme / rate / utilization.
	2) tx/rx frequency pairs.
	3) analog digitization rate.  mixing scheme.
	4) security code scheme.  unique to phone?
	5) power output.
	6) etc.

finally, i want to apologize for starting what probably appears to be a flame
war.  i promise to be better.  also, the three posts happened because the
newsreader kept telling me that the post did not go thru.  i haven't seen
a way to cancel with this reader, yet ;)

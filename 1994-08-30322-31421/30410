Now maybe there is something subtle I am missing about all of
this, but it seems to me that public-key technology provides a
"zero-knowledge proof" of a kind.  That is, if someone signs a
message and sends it back and the message checks out OK then you
know the person has a secret (the appropriate secret key)
without any clue about what that secret is.

For that matter any message you recieve that you can decrypt
with their public key proves the sender holds the secret key,
without revealing any knowledge of the secret key, or so it
seems to me.

Yes?  No?  If not what?  :-)

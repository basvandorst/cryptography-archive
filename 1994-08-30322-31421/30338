Lets putting words in my mouth here. I'll address A1 in the manner that I
interpret it after reading the relevant parts of my Oxford Companion to the
Supreme Court. In the United States of America you can't restrict free
expression AT ALL unless you demonstrate that the government has some greater
need. In cases involving none of the following:

Libel, Slander, Oscenity, Use of a limited public medium (spectrum), Secrets

the courts have required an extremely high burden of proof to be met by
the government. In cases in which the government has attempted to abridge
first amendment rights on the grounds that they posed a threat to national
security (as is the case here) the most established test (although many
different ones have been used) is that the government must demonstrate
a "clear and present danger" to national security. This is a test that
obviously is not fullfiled in the case of transmitting cryptographic
source code over the net.

In the spirit of your "logical flow" above, here is one the government might
use:

A1  * Government regulations prohibit the transmission of cryptographic source
      code to foreign nations via the net.
A2  * Posting source code to mailing lists and newgroups within the United
      States is equivalent to transmiting source code to foreign nations.
A3  * These Government regulations are not prevented by the first amendment.
A4  * The government can get a jury to convict a student for compormising
      the security of the united states by transmitting source code over the
      net.

A1 is just plain wrong. ITAR only applies to munitions. Munitions only include
physical objects, hence the recent ruling that disks containing code can not
be exported while books containing the same code can. ITAR has nothing to do
with the export of information.

A2 is a really difficult question which has not been resolved at all. Some
court somewhere ought to rule on it.

A3 is just plain wrong. The government must demonstrate that the threat I
pose by exercising my rights is sufficiently great to warrant the abridgement
of those rights. Not a chance.

A4... not a chance.

Treason is defined by a highly restrictive definition in the third article
of the constitution itself. Transmitting secrets is a breach of civil law
that may occur simultaneously with treason or may be confined to the private
sector. I believe that there are additional criminal laws at the federal level
reguarding the unauthorized transmission of secrets, but I wouldn't know.

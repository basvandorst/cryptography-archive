Fascinating.  So all one would have to do is reverse engineer a
Mycotronix chip and the EU members could interface to Clipper
data streams, via software, without paying the $ to US companies,
and without a claim of patent infringement.

Of course, this assumes that the US is stupid enough to continue
with Clipper (possibly) and that the US won't convince the UN to
send peacekeeping troops to keep the EU under control (just kidding).

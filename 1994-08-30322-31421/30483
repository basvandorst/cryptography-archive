You can also have two private keys, one on Earth and one on Mars --
and repeatedly encrypt a message in these keys, alternating
e[m[e[m[e[m[e[m[ .....[x]....]]]]]]]].

This gives release at the desired time only if people keep trying to get
there.  Therefore, it provides only a lower bound on the length of time
until release.  The upper bound comes from the date when simple factoring
of m's key will be easy.

Some diaries (like mine) would likely stay secure forever this way (since
I doubt anyone would be interested. :-)

: "How safe is RSA"

The security of RSA is based on the inherant difficulty in factoring
the products of large primes.

While it is conceavable that some spook community might have made
inroads into this difficulty, it is extremely unlikely.

It is yet to be proven (and I mean this quite mathematically)
that factoring *must* be more difficult (read time consuming)
than multiplying, and so it is remotely possible that some fast
way may be found.  However, I know of no one in the mathematics
community who will seriously entertain this possibility.  Rather,
they are keen to find the proof that is must be difficult, and
expect it to be found RSN, as was believed of fermat's last
theorum.  (read any century now)

and of course the actual security of RSA (assuming no factoring
shortcuts are found) is a function of it's key size, so pick the
one that makes you comfortable.  I for one feel confident that
todays government agencies do not have access to computers more
that 100 times faster than they admit to, and would choose a key
size which give me the desired period of security based on that
assumtion.

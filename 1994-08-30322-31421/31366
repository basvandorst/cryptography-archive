	I have a question about ANDOS ---
		All or Nothing Discovery Of Secrets.

	Why it so called?

	The example in my book is a protocol which Bob and Carol
buy secrets from Alice.  And Alice will not know which secret
Bob or Carol got.

	Why this is called ANDOS?

		Thanks in advance.

Best Regards,
Fat-Fat

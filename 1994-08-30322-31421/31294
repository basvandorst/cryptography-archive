w>True, but no requirement that the devices be digital.

My understanding is that although the telephone line need not be 
digital, the devices incorporating the Clipper chip must be.  The 
Skipjack algorithm works on a bit stream.  It is not an analog 
encryption scheme.  The only device I know that currently incorporates 
the Clipper chip is the AT&T secure phone, and I believe that it works 
by first compressing the analog voice data, then digitizing it, running 
it through the Skipjack algorithm and then sending it out through a 
modulator.

Actually, I'm leaving out some steps- the session key encryption scheme 
is not specified by Skipjack and I'm not sure how AT&T's doing it.  I 
understand that it actually can be difficult to get a encrypted link 
with these phones due to having to go over an analog line.  No doubt 
they work better over ISDN.

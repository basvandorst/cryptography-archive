Forrest Gump: "Practical is as practical does."

It's misleading in a practical sense, don't be silly.  It may not be
misleading in a theoretical sense, but this is obviously not what was
asked for.

It's funny to play games with people's misconceptions, but defending it
as a practical matter is just plain indefensible.

If you want to misdirect him, lead him to ECM.

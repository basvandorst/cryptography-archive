Actually, all one need have is ed-1 being divisible by the 
Least_Common_Multiple(p-1,q-1) (called lambda(n)) (Phi(n) is a bit of 
overkill)... of course IF it is divisible by phi(n), then it is divisible 
by lambda(n) (only need some multiple of lambda(n) to get an 
encryption/decryption pair... but if you can get a multiple of lambda(n) 
then there is a probabalistic attack to factor n)

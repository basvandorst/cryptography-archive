I asked the same in a email i sent to Matt Blaze. He responded that the
 *whole* package is considered cryptographic material, and removing the
 crypto routines only wouldn't change this fact. He pointed to me that this
 might be a conservative approach on the subject, but they (AT&T) prefer to
 be safe than sorry. Understandable, i guess. Any plans out there to create
 an equivalent package outside the US ?

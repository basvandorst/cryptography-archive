Here's another idea fora  self-destructing cryptosystem.  Every N days
at 7pm, your system gives you a new password, and re-encrypts the data.
Whether or not you are there.  If you aren't there, you lose your
data.   Dead-man switch encryption.

Risky, and it requires that the machine be turned on after you've been
captured and the program run, changing its encryption.

You might require your decrypter to be run, twice to get your data, in order
to assure that it is run once, thereby automaticly reencrypting data with an
unknown key.

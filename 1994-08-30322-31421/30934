Good point.  My understanding is that gramatically correct English
has an entropy of 1-2 bits per character.  Since we are dealing with
a collection of proper names, with no relationship to one another, and 
with possibly alien spelling, it would probably be safe to assume 3 bits
per character.  40-50 characters of such keys would probably suffice,
100 definitely would.  Say, 10 names of 10 characters each.

This would, of course, involve more than 128 bits of raw data, so the
actual key would have to be a hash function of all the clues.

Not a problem, assuming there isn't some underlying structure to the
choice of clues.  And with invented proper names, there shouldn't be.

 MJ> THE IDEAS

Excellento!  Saved!  Brings back memories.  Years (decades!) ago
at Motorola I had somewhat to do with "certified noise diodes"
which were selected Zener stock.

One other thing I seem fuzzily to recall: doing balanced
circuits and careful attention to geometry to reduce common-mode
RFI in the very hi-Z bits.

David, many of us know exactly how patents can be framed to get around
the "no computer program or mental process" restriction.  Some of us
have even done it.  You don't need to educate us about that.

However, a "software patent" or "algorithm patent" is one which gives
a monopoly on the use of an algorithm to the owner of the patent.  The
way in which the patent is framed is not substantive.

The RSA patent prevents non licencees from using the algorithm.  Any
patent which prevents anyone from using an algorithm whithout a
licence is an algorithm patent.  Therefore, the RSA patent is an
algorithm patent.  The fact that the RSA patent is framed as a process
patent does not change this fact.

It's the effect of the patent that matters.

Andrew.

This allows arbitrary application-supplied data to be encrypted?

If you expect "common sense" to apply then you'll be disappointed.

If you want a definitive answer then I would recommend that you and/or
your reseller consult with the State Department, or obtain legal advice,
or both.

I have been seeking an answer to a similar question recently in order
to legally import and re-export a European-originating SESAME
implementation (which provides, hybrid symmetric/asymmetric key
distribution, secure transmission of privileges, data integrity, and
encryption).

As part of a series of communications by telephone and fax with the NSA,
I produced the following note to summarise _my_ understanding of the 
position. It has no official standing, and is in lieu of getting answers
from the NSA in writing.

I have annotated it with some comments to elucidate some less obvious
points.

Specific NSA and State Department contact names are xxxxx-ed. Contact me
by private mail in the unlikely event you have trouble finding out who
to talk to.

We had sent them a draft FAQ which said what we had implemented, that
we were including Kerberos code, that we were providing a number
of security services (including encryption), and that we were using
specific algorithms DES and RSA (the latter from PGP).

As a matter of interest, does Israel require a export licence for
cryptographic munitions?

In our case, this seems to be the determinant of exportability.

The specific case I had in mind was if the code was brought in on
a laptop, then it could be brought out again by the same person if this
license was obtained. When the export is to arbitrary overseas customers,
then this case doesn't apply, and a normal export license is required.

So we would need to licence use of PGP-RSA from PKP, or license a 
RSA implementation from RSADSI.

So in summary the conclusion from my experience would be that you, or
rather your US-based vendor, would probably require a license.

[This was for software rather than hardware, though this may not make a
difference.]

My understanding is that use of this mechanism to implement the
security service doesn't rule your product out of scope - but it will
likely make it easier for you to get an export licence.

Good luck.

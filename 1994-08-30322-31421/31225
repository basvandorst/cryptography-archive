R(> 2) The friendly PO has recently been visiting the mail rooms of
R(> corporations in the Bay Area, opening FedX, etc. packages (not
R(> protected by the privacy laws of the PO's first class mail), and
R(> fining companies ($10,000 per violation, as I recall), for sending
R(> non-time-sensitive documents via FedX when they could have been

The operative question is whether or not anyone has the guts to take 
them to court to SEE if the FedX package, in their own mailroom, IS 
protected by the (US) Constitution's privacy provisions.  Is the 
mailroom staff opening up these packages voluntarily?  Has the 
corporation given its permission?  Does the PO have a legal document 
permitting them entry to private premises for these encursions? 
Without knowing any of the above, whatever happens in SFran is an 
unknown quantity from a legal perspective.

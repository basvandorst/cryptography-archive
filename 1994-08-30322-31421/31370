Probably not the "real" entropy, but the approximation based on the 
frequencies (for example... write PI in binary, check the entropy=... it 
is conjectured that PI is totally normal... that is, in any base, the 
distribution of the digits... or any fixed sublength subsequences... is 
that of random digits... so try it on PI in binary... the real entropy is 
zero... the digits are deterministic! Just because something, like PI, 
cannot be compressed by one algorithm does not mean it has high 
entropy..... heck all one has to give is an algorithm to compute pi, and 
that compresses all the digits at once... the infinitely many)

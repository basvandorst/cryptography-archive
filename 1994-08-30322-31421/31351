Of course it would be much easier and much faster to look up a number
pre-computed than actually compute it.

Perhaps immense magnitude was not clear enough.  For you to have a list of
all the prime numbers from 1 to a 100 digit number would require more
storage than feasible.  At last guess, (at least that I heard), there were
10^77 atoms in the guestimated known universe.  There are approximately
10^99 prime numbers from 1 to 10^100.  So, even if you could store, say a
50 digit number in one atom, you still don't have enough atoms.  And this
is assuming you can store your magnetic blip as small as an atom.

While it is true tht you only need to have a table up to about 10^65 to
factor RSA-130, this is far beyond our ability to store such a massive
list.  

>Q: What did the RSA-128 people do with all the numbers they found??

There was no RSA-128 project.  The project before RSA-129 was RSA-120.

Any numbers which might have been found on RSA-xxx were probably discarded.

The system you have described is basically a trivial form of the Vernam
tape approach.  Rather sophisticated versions were broken by Freedman in
the 30's  --  by hand and calculating machine.  For a historical review,
go get yourself a copy of Kahn's "The Codebreakers".  Get the hardback,
not the paperback version.  Your local library may have it.  it is a good
read.  For reviews of historical cryptanalysis, look up Agean Park press. 
They publish the old classics.

Actually (continuing the above), one need not use all primes from 2 to
(say) 2^K (K=13?)... one need only use those that divide (p-1)(q-1) (and
if, then, LCM(p-1,q-1) is a factor of the result, all messages can be
decrypted). If the LCM is NOT a factor (say, p and/or q are strong
primes -that is p-1 and/or q-1 have large prime factors) one knows that
some messages cannot be decoded. But what then is the percentage of x
relatively prime to n with:

Every prime that divides o_n(x) is less than 2^K?

(that is, the percentage of the messages which *are* decodeable).

It looks like one will need to use strong primes (at least... PGP does
not... do other implementations of RSA?) at least and test that only an
infinitesimal proportion of messages are decryptable (that is, have all
prime factors of their order less than 2^K).

[Note: decoding a message in RSA does *not* require factorization of n.
 This is only needed for efficient decoding, that is finding a small
 multiple of all the o_n(x) under which to take the multiplicative
 inverse of the open key exponent, "e". If one simply takes a number
 which is a multiple of many of the o_n(x) and obtains the inverse
 of "e" modulo this... very inefficient... one decodes many messages.
 If the primes p,q are not strong, this can be done for all the messages
 modulo n, but even if p,q *are* strong, for what percentage of the
 messages does this provide decryption (inefficient though it may be)?]

A while back I asked for information on any known FEAL HW-implementations. I
promised to summarize any responses. Sorry it took so long, I was extremely
busy.

I didn't get any replies pointing me to FEAL chips. Here is what I found by
doing a literature search:

1) FEAL chip implenting FEAL-8, 12 MByte data rate, 12 MHz, 1.5 um CMOS:

[MIY90] Miyaguchi, S.: "The FEAL Cipher Family". In: Menezes, A.J.; Vanstone,
S.A.: Advances in Cryptology -- CRYPTO '90 Proceedings, Conference on the
Theory and Application of Cryptography, Santa Barbara, CA, USA, 11-15 August
1990, pp. 627-638. Lecture Notes in Computer Science 537. Berlin: Springer 1991

[STE89] Steinacker, M.: "VLSI Crypto-Technology". Proceedings VLSI and Computer
Peripherals, 3rd Annual European Computer Conference, EUROCOMP 89, Hamburg,
Germany, 8-12 May 1989, pp. 4/159-163


2) FEAL chip for multimedia applications, 2 Mbit/s data rate:

[MAT93] Matsumoto, H.; Oyaizu, I.: "Encryption board for the ITU-T standard
audivisual services". NTT Research & Development, Vol. 42, Nr. 12, 1993, pp.
1557-1564

(Note: I have only read the abstract of this paper, as it is in Japanese!)


As I expected, there were no FEAL chips produced outside NTT, whose employees
invented FEAL.

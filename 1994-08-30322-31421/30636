If you mean the (good!) introductory article on Cryptology in the
August issue, you're over-interpreting. ("As the Clipper discussion
shows, the trend leads not only towards keeping algorithms secret, but
to authorities and intelligence trying to keep back-doors in order to
prevent privacy, authenticity and anonymity in public communication
networks from showing up in the first place." [c't 1994/8, p.238])

I don't recall reading anything specific about planned changes in
German policy on this issue.

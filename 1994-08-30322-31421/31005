Ive been reading the documention with PGP and a few maths books. I was
wondering if anyone had some info who if anyone has cracked RSA and if
so in what time period. Ive heard that a group of banks in England are
making a card called Mondex which I think is based around the RSA 
algorithm, it would be nasty if someone had already come up with an
easy way to crack RSA!

I think breaking RSA involves factorising the public key into the 2 
prime key componants. This however is meant to be very difficult.


I'm new to this group so I may have posted in the wrong place.

This isn't spilling the beans but just a reference for those who might be 
stuck: There was a debate in CACM in 1989 about check-digit algorithms with 
properties roughly similar to the one described in the posting.  The 
original article was in early '89 (maybe February), with a followup letter 
towards the end of the year (maybe September or October).  I have a number 
of (very simple) algorithms used by various mag card vendors here, but the 
posted algorithm is far more complex than any of these.

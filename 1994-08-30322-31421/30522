Oscillator jitter, diode noise, and nuclear decay are the three
most often used random sources.
Hughes aircraft uses diode noise, Rockwell uses oscillator jitter.
The chips are available to 'approved' users.
If u build one, watch out for asymetry in rise/fall's.
I doubt that anyone fabs the chips any more as the circuits are
typically small with 400-500 die per wafer. a few 50 wafer lots
yield lifetime supplys'.
I believe Hughes offers a commercial version that doesn't require
govt approval to purchase.
good luck-

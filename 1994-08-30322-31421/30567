No, this appears not to be the case.  In the UK at least, the opinions 
posted so far indicate that the fact the system is implemented entirely 
in software disbars it from patent, on those specific grounds.  Others 
have said that the same holds in Germany.  

Has anyone besides Sternlight argued to the contrary?  Has anyone come 
up with an example of a system patent granted in Germany, England, or 
other EC member country to a system entirely implemented in software?

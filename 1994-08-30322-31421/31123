Your statement does assume that the only way to break RSA is using the
algorithm you have kindly detailed above. Would it not be reasonable to
assume that there may be many other ways of solving the problem even if
we don't know what they are at the moment. It may well be that there is
another solution which does not require such massive computational power
but could be based upon for example statistical or even random methods.

I could choose a 8192,16384,... key. Does that mean that RSA can never
be broken if the user of the system keeps his/her key size at least twice
the number of bits of the last known factorisation?

I was at the time looking for solutions which are based upon methods other
than the predictable application of raw power. For example I could just
guess at the private key and then check if its correct or not. I may get
it right on the first guess or it make take until eternity, this means
there would be a probability:-)

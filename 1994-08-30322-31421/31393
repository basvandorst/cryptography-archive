Summary: information request

I'm writing a paper about solving obsolete ciphers, and would like some
help with the literature search.  Do you know of any published attacks on
double (incomplete) columnar transposition, either one or two keys, for a
single cryptogram without crib?  The only one I know of is Courville's
book, which anagrams short ciphers and then proves the solution.  Several
books deal with anagramming multiple ciphers, including the declassified
NSA books and the British SI instruction course, both from Aegean Park Press.

My best attack so far (not including a dictionary attack on a word-based
key) seems to have a work factor proportional to the square root of the
total key space, so that (for example) a single 13-letter key used for both
transpositions is about as difficult as one with 8- and 9-letter keys for
the two transpositions, and each can be solved overnight on a laptop
(assuming 200 or so letters of unmanipulated English).

I'm thinking of using a brain-damaged DES for another example.  I think
somebody reported in sci.crypt recently that some company was planning
to use 2- or 4-round DES as their encryption to get an export license.
Am I remembering that right?  Could you remind me of that message?

Thanks!

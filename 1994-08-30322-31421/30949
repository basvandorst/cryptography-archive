Since everyone scoffs (myself included) at the idea of the post office
providing digital signatures, and key services, I'd like to ask a 
question of the group.

If public key cryptography is going to become really widespread,
what entity or entities should be providing signature and certificate
services for general transactions?


Please post and/or e-mail me and I will post a summary in a few weeks.

Thanks!

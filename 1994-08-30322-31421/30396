If Stanford and Mit had applied for a patent before publishing, it
probably would have gotten stomped on as secret and they would not have
gotten a patent either in the USA or elsewhere. That was why they
published first and lost European patent rights, as I understand it.
That way they at least got US rights and the possibility of the
technology being used, instead of getting nothing and having the
technology be buried. (Hmm shades of PGP there. "Lets do an end run
around the law so as to have at least some of our goals be fulfilled")

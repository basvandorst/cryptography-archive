I'm just as skeptical of GP for these problems. Koza's book on
"Genetic Programming" describes pseudo-random number generators "evolved"
with GP.

Closer examination, though, showst the PRNGs to be of the
old-fashioned, weak sort. It is mostly the _seeds_ that are twiddled,
and GP method can indeed generate some PRNGs that are better than
others. GP is still just another hill-climber.

Much more impressive would be a GP evolution of something as strong or
stronger than Blum-Blum-Shub. But the BBS algorithm relies on fairly
deep number theory knowledge, and merely twiddling exponents and
symbols would not do much. (The needle sticking up again, with the
"cryptographically good" points being adjacent to cryptographically
useless points, in a space of vast size.)

I challenged a friend of mine recently on this. He's a fan of GP, and
made the claim that GP could evolve PRNGs like BBS. I urged him to "go
for it," to spend the weeks or months getting the code running (my
friend initially claimed it would take a week or two...he now figures
longer). 

I urge others to do this as well. I'm skeptical, but GP adovocates
could make their name in crypto by doing this.

Hello friends:

Searching on different Internet resources like ftp, gopher, mosaic; I think
that it is very hard to find something related to CODING THEORY, in the sense
that by the Shannon Theorem.

Maybe one of the reasons for this is the dual nature of that theory : both
mathematical and communication engeneering. I think that the most important
of all this is the change of information between coding researchers. 
Because of this, here,  at the Department of Communications at Campinas
University, it has been built a WWW server for having an own page about 
coding theory.

Suggestions and something relative it is wellcome.

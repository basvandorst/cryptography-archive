More specifically, where can I find some?  I've read the FAQ, gone
net-surfing, asked my friends, and even prayed for one to fall off the net
onto my HD, all to no avail.  The FAQ said to make your own - surely
someone's done this and archived it somewhere, no?

If I could write a wish-list, it would have:

Frequency of letters (%, not just ordering);
Frequency of initial letters (ditto);
Frequency of terminal letters (ditto again);
Frequency of most common digraphs.

Any ideas?  If I get fed up with waiting and make my own, is there
interest in having it posted or archived?

Thanks-

Brendon

By the way, a caution. Some of the early VCR+ -included VCRs could accept the
codes to set up the VCR, but did not have the infra-red transmitter to
switch a cable box. Such VCRs, like conventional ones, could not switch the
box among scrambled channels requiring a cable box to record properly,
though the stand-along VCR+ devices can. I think last year's RCA VCRs
"including VCR+" were in that category, as I recall.

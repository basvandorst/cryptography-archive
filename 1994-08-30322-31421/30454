I *have* checked them before establishing the crypto subtree on our
ftp site. According to BSI (the German Information Security Agency),
there are no problems with using strong crypto in German, or making it
available on an ftp site or a BBS.

True, there are some projects to outlaw strong crypto - ain't the cops
in all countries alike - but I strongly suspect that they will fail
just as they have failled in the Netherlands.

I wouldn't. Kohl doesn't threaten to sue the people because they are
using something he happens to hold the patent on. :-)

Follow-ups redirected outside the technical crypto groups.

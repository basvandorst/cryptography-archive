Actually, there is something else one could present that
is relevant to the question, "How safe is RSA".

One could compare RSA (the security of which is depedent on
a problem that has not been proven to be hard) with other
encryption techniques, which might not have this drawback.

For example, can one construct non-linear keystream generators
that are provably hard?  If so, then there is a perspective from
which encryption based on such a generator is "safer"
than RSA.

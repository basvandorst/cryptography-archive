Stephen Wolfram proposed use of cellular automata for crytography some
years back; his collection of essays on cellular automata contains at
least one such mention.

Many people suspected that 1D CAs were no stronger than linear
feedback shift registers (LFSRs), and I recally hearing a couple of
years ago that someone proved 1D CAs (and maybe all CAs?) are
equivalent to LFSRs, which have been used in crypto for many years.

Intuitively, the idea of a CA looks attractive for "one-way
functions," for the reasons mentioned. But what's the "trapdoor" that
gives the key holder a shortcut to reverse the process? (Public key
crypto needs a trapdoor 1-way funtion that is easy to reverse if one
has the right information).

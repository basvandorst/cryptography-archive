I have a client who wants to distribute a large spreadsheet which
contains proprietary data.  We can hide confidential data and
formulae, then protect the spreadsheet with a password to prevent
this information from being accessed.

Question: Is Excel encryption serious?  (I tried Microsoft Support,
who have no idea.)

I assume, without knowledge of my own, that they use a password to
encrypt/decrypt the data.  Thus, there isn't a single point where
you can change an instruction, since decrypting with the wrong
password gives garbage.

Does anybody know about the protection provided by this Product?

(Excel 4.0 for Mac and 5.0 for Windows are to be used, 5.0 for Mac
if it is available in time.)

Thank you for your attention.

Lew

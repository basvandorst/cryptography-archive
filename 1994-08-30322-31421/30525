Interesting idea, but most of the posts I've seen concentrate on how

Surely, you've got to worry about the bulk-encrpytioon algorithm too,
otherwise attackers will ignore the key and go straight for that...

Not only that but you have to make sure that the keyspace is big enough
to forestall a direct search.

I'm sure you've all thought of this but sometimes we miss the obvious...

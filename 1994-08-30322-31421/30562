Thank you.

I remain convinced that the RSA patent would not have been granted in the
UK, irrespective of any prior publication, for the reasons detailed below.

I agree that this is the crux of the argument, so I have rechecked some
reference books I have.  They are adamant that software patents are not
allowable, but agree with you that software may be part of a larger
invention.  There are however conditions to the latter.

There appear to have been two approaches to the patentability of inventions
including software.  The stricter is to ignore the software and to ask how
much invention is the the remaining function.  Although I have not studied
the actual PKP patent, it would appear that all the invention is the
algorithm and the hardware is merely a generic computer.  It would
therefore fail this test.  If the hardware were more specific, then it
would of course not prevent the algorithm being used in an ordinary
computer.

The alternative, slightly looser, test is that if the purpose of the
program and machine is to bring about an innovative effect, which is a
"technical contribution to the state of the art" (whatever that is), it may
be allowable.  My understanding is that this must be a physical, not an
abtract effect.

It appears that UK law puts more weight on the first test.  Both tests
obviously allow the two examples you quote of a chemical plant or a radio,
where one component (temperature control or tuning) may be digital or
analogue.

I would like to look at two other aspects.  I can run the PGP algorithm in
my PC.  The PC is a perfectly ordinary PC, and is obviously not subject to
the PKP patent.  Similarly the program is not patented as that is statute
barred.  So where's the innovation in putting them together.  The act of
loading a program isn't exactly state of the art, nor is operating a
computer to run a simple "filter" program.

The other point is that software patents were barred by the Patents Act
1977.  The law had a major update in the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act
1988, and a minor update in the Copyright (Computer Programs) Regulations
1992.  However no attempt was made in either of the latter to modify the
patent position of software or to close any apparent loophole.  Describing
a general purpose computer loaded with the program as a specific bit of
hardware is too obvious a loophole that would vitiate the whole intention
of barring software patents.  The fact that such an obvious loophole was
not closed, means that the Patent Office and courts were not giving it any
credibility, that the hardware component has to have a real effect and not
merely be a vehicle for the software.

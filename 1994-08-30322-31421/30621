No, a trademark does not have to be registered.  A trademark is created by
using it.  Registering is a good idea, because it gets you national
protection.  Without registering, you run the serious risk of ending up
with a mark that is limited geopgrahically to the places you've actually
purveyed your product.

(By the way, the letters TM are only used with unregistered trademarks.
When the trademark is registered, you use circle-R).

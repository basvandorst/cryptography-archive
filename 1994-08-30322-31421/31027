I was unable to answer because you failed to specify Y and X.
*Noone* can answer it without this data.

"How safe is RSA"  *IS* meaningless, because one can get as much security
as desired by increasing the key size. The answer is "it is as safe as
you want to make it".

:Do you happen to have for a formula for determining the probability of
:cracking an n bit RSA within the time period t?

"the time period t"?  What is 't'?

You can break an RSA key whose value is near 2^n  (an n-bit number) in
time

O(exp((1.092 + o(1)) ((n log 2)^1/3 (log (n log 2))^2/3)

using the Number Field Sieve. Is this what you were looking for?
If you have K machines working on the problem, it will run K times
as fast.

100%
 
For sufficiently large n, the above estimate will be quite close to
the actual time. Of course, the implied constant depends on the 
implementation and the machines you run it on. You also need to 
specify K.

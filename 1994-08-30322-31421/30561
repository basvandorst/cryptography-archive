If you're seriously this paranoid, I suggest packing the empty space in
your computer with thermite, which if high school chemistry serves (by all
means, look it up) is about 50/50 rust (iron oxide) and aluminum shavings.
Put it in a plastic bag (or several) to keep the shavings out of those parts
of your computer that don't like having metal filings randomly shorting out
traces.  For a fuse, use a little magnesium ribbon, which you can ignite
with a cigarette lighter and ought to burn hot enough to ignite the
thermite.  Stick it through the vent grill in the front so you can just
light it when the door bursts open.

This ought to be good for getting rid of any other incriminating evidence
in your abode.  The place itself, too.  I specifically do NOT recommend
this approach.

Is there a way to do this in software?  No.  Magnetic traces of data stay
on the disk quite a while, and you probably don't have time to do multiple
overwrites of data while the door is caving in.

An interesting question.  The point of the copy of the bill that I saw
(last year's) was that it required the provider to be able to tap *any
combination* of lines and route them to the FBI.  This can mean a *lot*
of lines.  Consider the case of an investigation of a major Government
contractor.  We could easily be talking about thousands of lines.

What are the implications?  Let's see -- the classic wiretap looks like
this:

     A ---------+---------- B
                |
                |
                Z

This is a "three point connection".  The connection can be as simple as
a couple of clipleads.  It can also be done in the switch, which is what
the FBI is after.

Now switching matrix theory is an interesting area that I know far too
little about.  Hopefully, somebody who knows more than I do on the
subject can jump in here.

Anyway, an important characteristic of a switch is that it be "non
blocking".  In other words, the existence of a connection from A to B
cannot prevent a connection from Y to Z from being set up.  Now, there
are some theoretical ways of making sure that a switch is, in fact, non
blocking.

However, it is *impossible* to have a nonblocking switch that allows
three port connections.  The "classic" tap is a three port connection.
To maintain nonblocking, the obvious solution is to use two two port
connections:

     A ---------+ +-------- B
                | |
                | |
                 Z

which is just what the doctor ordered for a MitM attack.

Hmm ... and I'll bet that if somebody knew the details of the Capstone
chip, they could even make a box that forced all three stations (four
Capstones) to use the same key ....

Maybe the FBI is confident that the switch manufacturers will simply do
it this way, either on their own or with a little "friendly
persuasion".  (Nahh.  More likely, they expect the manufacturers to
provide an access panel so that they can hook their alligator clips to
the screw heads on the relays.  1/2 :-)

A has a set of numbers from the range 0..999999999
B has a set of numbers from the range 0..999999999

How do they calculate the size of the intersection of their sets
without revealing more?

According to Dagens Nyheter, the biggest dayly newspaper in Sweden,
it is not possible without A and B finding out which are colliding.[1]

I saw something similar here on the subject of cryptology for kids,
therefore I guess there might be a version for grownups.

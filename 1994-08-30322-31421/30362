Oh, c'mon Padgett - you were one of Clipper's few defenders around here.
Don't you know this stuff by now?  :-)

Anyway, it is not yet illegal to send encrypted messages within the
United States or from there to other places, except for certain  cases
in which the government has decided to limit free speech, such as
Amateur Radio.  Importing cryptosoftware and descriptions of
encryption methods are legal, though the government insists on
licenses for crypto hardware.  Exporting crypto hardware or exporting
software on magnetic media without government interference also
requires a license, except that there may be exceptions for free
public-domain code, and exporting printed computer softwarealso risks
interference, though Bruce Schneier's book got a commodity
jurisdiction with no major problems, as the government really didn't
want to risk a good First Amendmentt case.

There's no U. S. law against telling your correspondent how to get the
decryption software from ftp.funet.fi, either.

Furthermore, there are no ITAR problems with using PGP in the US;
the only legal problems there are patents, and maybe trademarks if you
go selling the stuff under Phil's trademarked Pretty Good Privacy name
without his permission.  And ViaCrypt and the MIT 2.6 release don't
have those problems.

Key exchange is also fine.  Key generation devices may be affected, if
they're cryptographic; shipping dice overseas is probably not an ITAR issue.

On the other hand, the U.S. government *is* trying to change all these
freedoms, as you well know, especially for telephone and datacomm providers.

Also, if you're communicating with people in differently controlled countries,
they may have local laws oppressing them that prevent them from using
encryption freely, and may even cover you as well, even if you think
you're outside their jurisdiction.  I don't think anybody else's ITAR
laws covered crypto, and COCOM is dead anyway, but France had laws about it,
the Soviet Union didn't need written laws, and some other places were
generally hostile. 

I wouldn't recommend shipping those dice to Iran, either;
shortly after their revolution against the Shah, probability teachers
had to start finding examples other than gambling to remain
politically correct... and encrypted copies of the Satanic Verses are
likely to be a bad idea.

"Mod" is not a function.  "a = b modulo c" is a statement that means, in
effect, the remainders of a and b are equal when divided by c.  There's
actually a more formal mathematical definition involving residue
classes, but the remainders definition is good enough to do arithmetic
by.  The equal sign really should be a congruence sign, with three lines
instead of the two of an equal sign.  The "mod 40" applies to the entire
statement, not just the number on the right side of the equation.

Thus 8 = 13 modulo 5, 1234981234 = 2394828911234 modulo 10000, et cetera.

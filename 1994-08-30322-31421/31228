NP stands for non-deterministic polynomial (one than can be solved on a 
non-deterministic Turing machine... one that can guess the correct value 
to use for some polynomial number of bits, which, if guessed correctly, 
give the checkable result)... eg to factor n... guess a factor and see if 
it works... factoring is NP... question... is it P (can you keep it 
polynomial while getting rid of the need for luck)?

NPC are the hardest NP problems... if anyone of them can get rid of the 
need for a correct guess, than all NP problems can be done without guessing.

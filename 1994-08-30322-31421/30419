 Indeed.

 Those who remember the few previous messages in this thread will
 recall that this was essentially my point.

 The whole thing started with the assertion (in response to a
 question by a newbie) that any cipher which "allows simple
 compression" cannot be good.  My point was this was a far too
 broad statement, and gave the example that any cipher which
 produces network-transportable ASCII can be compressed.  Then,
 anticipating the argument that 8-bit-to-6-bit conversion was "not
 part of the cipher," I introduced Penknife as an example of a
 real cipher which gains some of its strength *after* the
 8-bit-to-6-bit conversion.  And one can readily imagine valid
 cipher designs which operate on 6-bit symbols throughout.

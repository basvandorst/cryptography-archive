The trouble is that there is no experimental way of knowing if an
algorithm is P-time or not.  You cannot tell about behaviour at
infinity.  So you will not know if a procedure is P-time or not,
except by a theoretical argument and if an algorithm works in
P-time, but this fact is unprovable (and I would imagine that one
can show such algorithms exist, although you couldn't exhibit one),
then you would have no way of knowing it.  This is more or less the
same error Roger Penrose made in his rather silly book, The
Emperor's New Mind, whose mathematics is wrong on just such a point.

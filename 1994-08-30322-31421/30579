You could (and should) read the FAQ, but I'll try and give you a
brief run down.

Everybody knows how to crack RSA.  The difficulty is doing it
before you die or the universe ends, depending on how long the
key is.

The security of RSA rests in the difficulty of factoring large
numbers.  Your public key is an exponent and a large number
called the modulus which is the product of two large primes. 
Anyone who wants to crack your secret key simply factors the
modulus.

Problem is that this takes a long time.  RSA-129 was a project
to break a 429 bit RSA key.   Thus they had to factor a 429 bit
number (129 digits if I recall).  This took 8 months, over a
thousand computers (?) etc etc.  This is probably the "rumour"
that the original poster heard.  <sigh>  RSA is still secure, we
just have a better picture of *how* secure.

Hope this helps, please get the FAQ, or I can send it to you,
and feel free to ask any questions in email.  ttul

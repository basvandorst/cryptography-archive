Which countries do you know or suspect are using
RSA for military transmissions?  Is it clear there
*are* any such instances?

Military and diplomatic transmissions tend to have
security requirements ranging decades into the future.
Since the security of RSA hinges upon the present 
unavailability of good factoring approaches, I doubt
that any miltary organization would make much use of it.

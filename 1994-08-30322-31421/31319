Three questions to ask are:

1. How long of a stream of random characters do you need to
generate?

2. Does the stream need to be deterministic (e.g. do you require
the ability to reset the generator and obtain an identical
stream)?

3. What is meant by "good" ?


One very simple approach that comes to mind is the following:

    64 bit Binary Counter ---> D E S --> decimate --> 8-bit character
                                /\
    56 bit Key ------------------|

One drawback of the above is that it has a slight bias --
the occurence of a given character code slightly reduces
the probablility of that code again occurring.  An advantage
is, that by initializing the counter and the key, one has
the choice of a large number of sequences.

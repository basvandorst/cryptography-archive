You may be looking at the guts of RC2 or RC4. These are trade-secret RSA
algorithms included in BSAFE. One is a stream cipher and one a block cipher.
Both of them allow variable key sizes, so the export-crippled versions of
the software can use 40-bit keys and domestic versions can use longer keys.
If you manage to get the whole algorithm, many people would be interested
in seeing it. RSA might sue you, however.

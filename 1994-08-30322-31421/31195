It seems that the question at hand is 'what is a decent level of security?'.
The RSA 129-bit trick that Bellcore pulled off took a great deal of thought
before the task was even started; then it took quite a few people and many
machines a decent amount of time to decode a simple sentence.  Did anyone
collect the $100?  I haven't heard.

What *is* interesting is that computational power seems to be asymtotic, yet
there are generational leaps.  I believe that an upperlimit of silicon will
be met with sub-micron masking of the CPU's, yet the algorithm used to 
compute may provide factors of greater speed in such endeavors.  To this 
element, one could envision a 'fractal' computer that approaches the problem
at hand in a completely different manner, and the speed found necessary today
will be replaced with cleverness tomorrow.

I have no doubt that 512/768 will be broken within a decade, given the notice
of this topic in the academic circles - Clipper discussions are likely to lead
others to look at RSA.  There are many smart, clever people out there.

So...I make a key with 1024 bits to tell my wife, "I love you".  A key with
65536 on my resume...and when I plot to overthrow the world...a kazillion
bit key (just kidding Mr. NSA!).

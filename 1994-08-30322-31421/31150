I have just been catching up on this thread which was started by trefor.
Before I chip in my two pennyworth I cannot ignore the side issues which 
have, at times, detracted from the value of the discussion.


----------------------------- Side Issues------------------------------

Until I started reading this thread I only knew of Bob Silverman by
name and I have had no contact with him. Trefor is quite capable
of standing up for himself so what I have to say is based solely on my reading
of the thread so far. At the risk of making myself unpopular by my first
contribution here goes:

Judging by his words it is, I think,fair to say that Bob Silverman appears
to forget that his words convey not only his intellectual wisdom but also
give a clear exposition of his attitude to others. 

Judging by his style it appears that he only wants people to value him
for his intellectual qualities. 
If he is unwilling or unable to apply his critical intellect to refining his
ability to communicate his intellectual wisdom, without giving offense by
his style, then so be it. Personally I feel very it is a shame because whilst
I think I understand what he is saying mathematically I am sure I do 
understand, his attitude to others and it is, frankly, not very appealing
to me. 

I am new to this group and I welcome minds like yours Bob but it is also 
clear from this thread that a few tutorials
from a professor in human communication skills might not go amiss. 
Would you, in such circumstances apply your own dictum:

If you had added to this list is at least a basic grounding in the skills
of human communications and understanding (after all this is the sine
qua non of all newsgroup activity) 

Then your statement:

>It is obvious that  many people who post here have not done so.

would have been quite clearly applicable to you.


------------------------Second Bit --My two pennyworth ---------------

OK enough of that-- now returning to the main theme. 
There seems to be two major threads to the intellectual part of the 
discussion.

The first thread seems to be set on exposing mathematical formulae
which, in the end, might, at best, be able to tell us how long it will take
to decrypt  codes of a specific byte length using particular algorythms on
particular systems. These results are analogous to asking a plumber how
safe is my  central heating system and getting a reply which tells you
how long it takes for pipes to be eroded by the water that they are meant
to contain.


The second thread, which seems to have been less well explored,  invites the
question "for what purpose".

I mean is RSA safe enough to be used as a basis for a world wide banking
transaction scheme? Is it safe enough for the workings of the
world monetary system to depend upon for all its every day financial
transactions? 

Is RSA encryption safe enough for a head of state to rely upon to ensure
that only he could authorise a nuclear missile strike?

How likely is it that competing intelligence agencies are able to crack
one another's encrypted messages?


I am not asking this group to become  social.implications.encrypt but what
I  would like to see emerging from this discussion is an adequate
level of scientific response to the question "how safe is RSA" to enable
the replies to be fed into discussion of the  social, philosophical and
practical issues which arise from the existence of RSA.

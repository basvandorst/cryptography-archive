This is blatantly false. The original assertion was "not patentable in
Europe". When Switzerland was offered as a counterexample, the attempt was
made to shift the ground to "the European Union" which was never in the
original message.

False.

False.

Irrelevant. Also false. "Europe" means a group of countries wider than those
in the Union elsewhere in the world.  "American" means the U.S. even in
Canada and Latin America ("Los Americanos"). It also means that in the U.K.
When the BBC says, on the news, that "The Americans have...." they mean the
U.S. and everybody knows it. You can't save this mistake by fast dancing;
stop trying as it only wastes space

If you mean "European Union" you need to say so, or say EEC or some such.
Unless you are dealing non-Union members out of Europe by revisionist
geography, you simply cannot support the case you are making.

Even if the phrase is "European law" rather than "in Europe", the normal
construction of the English language in most of the world is that "European
law" means 'the law in European countries' and not 'the joint laws of the
EU'. To assert the latter is the kind of British hubris (polite for
arrogance) that once led to the headline in The Times "Record Fog; Continent
Isolated." and at another time led a Prime Minister to rise in Parliament
and say, "Gentlemen, the WOGs begin at Calais."

(Don't mess with me on this--I got my Ph.D. in London.)

So what? The writer said "Europe" not "U.K."

But to address your specific comment, you seem unable to read. RSA is not a
software patent but a system patent. Systems patents are common in the U.K.
or you'd have no process patents on chemical refineries, etc. Rather than
perpetuating your ignorance, I suggest you read the RSA patent.

This fast smudge won't wash. "algorithm or system" smears the crucial
difference. They are not the same. The first is not patentable even in the
U.S. The second is, just about everywhere.

Again, you are either writing from ignorance or deliberately attempting to
throw dust in our eyes. Germany has more system patents (process plants,
etc.) than almost any other country. It's one of their biggest exports.

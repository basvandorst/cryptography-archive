Yes. You can find it in the usual places for this sort of thing but if
you can't, get ftp://ftp.mantis.co.uk/pub/users/tony/wordunp.zip. 28K,
source included; it's by Marc Thibault <marc@tanda.isis.org>. Some
people have reported difficulty getting stuff from here by FTP; do let
me know if you're having problems.

HOWEVER, the protection used by WinWord is so trivial that it's much
more fun to crack it yourself, armed only with a copy of Word (optional
really), a hex editor and a few microscopic programs to XOR things. Word
6 tries slightly harder, but it's still a piece of piss to crack.

I can't help with the algorithm but I can give you some information on 
how cc:mail passes messages.  Remember that "messages" are not stored
or passed between servers, "files" are.  All messages reside in a single
file on the server and messages that need to move between servers are
moved as files.

If I remember correctly, the files on the servers are always encrypted
and the files are also encrypted in transit.

Hope this helps,

Eric

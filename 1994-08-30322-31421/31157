This is no doubt a naive question, but if RSA, or other public key
encryption scheme were to become widespread, who would be 
responsible for coming up with the millions of "unfactorable" numbers
and their factors, and gauranteeing that everyone had thier own unique
keys?  It seems like it would require a fairly computationally intense
effort to generate the number of numbers required to make widespread
RSA feasible.

1) the encryption standard in GSM, A5, is not desclosed.  But folks who
know have not thought it of cryptographic quality.

2) a mobil to mobil call, unless within the same cell, will be routed
over land lines between transmitters (sometimes even microwave links
instead of land lines!!).  Nobody encrypts these links.

3) the Friends of Big Brother, who seem nowdays to run much of Washington,
have opposed even things like A5 for the US phone system.  Thus, our network
is much less secure.

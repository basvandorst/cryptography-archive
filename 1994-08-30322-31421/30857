	I just had a thought.  Suppose the Digital Telephony bill goes through.
and the FBI gets it ability to remotely listen in on the traffic.  For the sake 
of this question, let's say that the info from the initiating clipper set is 
transmitted to and recieved from the exchange via an analog signal (this is true
for the recipient also).  At the exchange, the analog signal is converted to a 
digital one (via an A/D conv. D/A outbound).  With the signal encoded as a 
digital one, it should be easily replicated.  Now a copy is made and the original
data is passed imediately along (at this point I don't think that either set would
detect MIM attack because to them, none has occurred), but the copy of the full
transaction (this includes the negotiation, data (not sure if transaction is the
proper term)) is uploaded to the FBI.  

	If the FBI has the full knowledge of the 
system and the data, would it be difficult for them to extract the data without
bothering to get the keys from the key escrow authority?  Assuming they know how
the fields are laid out, could they easily apply the captured keys to their own
"clipper" sets?  And with enough money, couldn't a private entity do this also?
Yes I know that it wouldn't be legal, but that concept has been ignored in the past.
Assuming that this concept is viable, what good would key escrow or MIM detection
do?  OBTW: If someone has brought this up before, I am not trying to steal your
thunder, I just haven't seen it and am curious.

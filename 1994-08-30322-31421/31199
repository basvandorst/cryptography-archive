Hello to all of you,
I was very glade finding some people knowing things like DES and IDEA.
May anyone of you tell me the stucture of an DES-Algo. or describe me the
math.-way of an DES-Encrytion?
I really plan to construct a hardware 'cracking' just one PW (not a whole
file) in about - let's say - 2 weeks. This hardware should do the same as
a normal Crack, but the will be more CPU's ever seen in a computer (in most
computers).
Here's the problem: planning such a computer needs the knowledge of DES-
Encryption to program the software in assembler to compute the problem on
more than one CPU.
If someone can help me, please do `R'eply to:
 
ac067@rs1.rrz.uni-koeln.de

Thank you! Yours ac067.

  Well, let's assume infinite resources to start. One could launch a key
in a radar proof container into a (very) slowly decaying orbit. 100
years and a heatsheild later, the key is back on earth broadcasting it's
location to the various interested parties. Ice Station Zebra and all that.

  Dropping the key to the bottom of the ocean with a timed refloatation
device is another method.

  A clue might be taken from conventional time capsule in that the key could
be placed in the foundation of a structure in such a manner that recovery
would jepordize the building. When the building was finally removed, the
key is recovered.

  Shorter duration keys could be hidden by encoding a radar beam and bouncing
it off of another planet (5 hour delay at most).

  Hope that stimulates some thought.

Ha! Sternlight sees a long thread that deviates from strictly
technical issues and decides to flame in. OK, I'm game.

While it is indeed not a requirement, it is a wise thing to do. The
ignorance of some of the participants of this newsgroup is certainly
not Mr. Silverman's fault.

Well, I happen to like his personal style. While he is indeed often a
bit harsh with the ignoramuses, he is always to the point, knows what
he is talking about, and there is very often valuable information in
his articles. Those who feel offended by his style should swallow
their egos and try to learn from his posts.

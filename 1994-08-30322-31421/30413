   I'm interested in building random-number generators using
oscillators, but am not sure of the techniques used. One kind
reader pointed me to Abidi's paper 'Noise in Relaxation
Oscillators', but this paper talks about how an oscillator can be
noisy, not how to make a noise source out of a noisy oscillator.
   I read about chips that have RNGs made out of 2 oscillators. How
does this work? If I simply XOR the output of 2 noisy oscillators,
one running at around 3.1MHz and the other at say 1.3MHz, and sample
at regular intervals, say every 200 microseconds, how random is this
sample? What if I feed one oscillator to the CLK input of a D-type
latch, and the other oscillator to the D input?
   Or, just off the top of my head, if I take that output and run
it through a low-pass filter so I get a rising and falling wave,
and run it through a comparator to obtain a 'higher than
half'/'lower than half' output, what kind of randomness might that give?

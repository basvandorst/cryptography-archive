The Diffie-Hellman problem has inputs g^x and g^y and solution g^xy.

The problem of breaking ElGamal has inputs of public key and cryptogram
and solution as the message i.e. inputs g^x,g^k,m*g^(xk) and solution m.

Suppose I have an oracle that solves DH. Then I give it g^x, g^k from
the ElGamal problem and it gives me g^xk so I can decrypt just as the
legitimate recipient.

On the other hand, suppose I have an oracle to break ElGamal. Then I
give it g^x,g^y,r where g^x and g^y are from the DH problem and r
is a random element in the field (or I could choose the identity).
It returns a value s which satisfies s*g^(xy) = r so I calculate
g^(xy) = r*s^-1 to break DH.

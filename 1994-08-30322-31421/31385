Why would one want to do that?  To deprive the authors of this incredbily
novel invention the fruits of their creativity?  To deprive the
universities, the beneficial owners of the patent, the funds with which to
sponsor more novel and valuable research?  To spite your face?

The patent is  broadly licensed under terms, presumably, acceptable to the
licensees.  Further art is not being inhibited by the patent.  Personal
use is not being inhibited.  And the patent expires soon any way.  It
seems to me that the intent of the law under which the patent was issued
has been well served.  

If, like Richard Stallman, you have a problem with the law, address the
law.  Do not scapegoat these patent holders or this patent.  

Remember, you too may do something novel.  You have an interest in the
rights of authors.

Hmm, I don't seem to recall seeing any copies of Word in US stores
plastered with "DO NOT EXPORT ON PENALTY OF TEN YEARS IN JAIL"
stickers, and I'm sure I've seen it in 'grey imports' ads in the
UK. So if they did use DES in the US (which they clearly don't
according to the other response to my message), then lots of
people would have been breaking the ITAR regs.

Seriously, the logisitical problems of having two different versions
would be immense (I can just see some Microsoft sales guy ringing up 
the NSA - "Uh, sorry, but we just exported a million US copies of Word
with DES encryption by accident"). It would also make it impossible for
people to mail encrypted word documents around the world as the two
systems would obviously be incompatible.

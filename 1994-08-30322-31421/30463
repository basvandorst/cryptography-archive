I was wondering if there has been any other HW implementation of FEAL
besides the one mentioned in the following article:

Steinacker, M.: "VLSI Crypto-Technology". Proceedings VLSI and Computer
Peripherals, 3rd Annual European Computer Conference, COMPEURO 89, Hamburg,
Germany, 8-12 May 1989

This article mentions a HW implementation of FEAL that encrypts 12 MByte/s.
It doesn't give any details and doesn't mention which FEAL version this is
for. The reference given for this chip is:

[17] NEL data sheet NLC 5001F, 1989

I guess it should be "NEC" instead of "NEL" and the algorithm implemented
would be the original FEAL-4 judging by the publication time of the data
sheet. 

Any information about other FEAL implementations in HW, whether research
or commercial, is appreciated. Please send email, I will post a summary of
responses later. If you do not want your answer to be included in the
posted summary, please say so. Thanks for your help!

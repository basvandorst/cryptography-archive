I remember my ungraduate physics lab days.  One project was to build a
"random noise source".  The ciruit was based on an op-amp (standard 741),
and a large resistor for thermal noise source.  Basically, resistor was
attached across the op-amp inputs, and feedback resistors were chosen
for a very large gain.
 
When connected to an oscilloscope to check the output, everything looked
random enough, but, nerd that I am, something just didn't seem right.
So I started playing with scope adjustments, trying to see if there
were any reasonable patterns hidden in frequency, phase, trigger level,
etc.

It turns out that the "noise" was modulation of a carrier signal at
830Khz, a nice little 50,000 watt AM radio station in the area.  No
antenna, just the wires on the breadboard picked it up.

Be careful what you call random, and consult an experimental physicist
to understand the true perversity of nature.

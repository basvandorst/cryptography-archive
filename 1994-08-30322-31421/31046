As a starting point, the 129-digit number RSA-129 was factored in
about 8 months, using about 5000 MIPS-years of crunching, by a netwide
team of people a few months ago.  That's 129*(3.x) bits long, ~430,
somewhere between PGP's 384-bit and 512-bit key lengths.
So don't use 384-bit keys for anything serious, or 512-bit for
anything real serious.

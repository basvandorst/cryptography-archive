Hi,
	A while ago, somebody mentioned a modern book on 
	cryptography, heavy with math...  Unfortunately,
	not only have I lost that posting,but also don't 
	remember either the author, or the book title.  (:-(

	Now - I understand how silly this sounds - but would
	you mind sending me e-mail with possible candidates?
	Maybe I'll remember it when I see it?

	Thanks! [And apologies! Any good drug for sclerosis? :-]

When Phil Karn proposed using MD4 as the crypto engine in a cipher system
in Feb 1991 it sounded new to me; later discussion indicated that there had
been some math done earlier (Asiacrypt?) suggesting that several rounds of
the hash function were needed to make it strong enough.  I think Peter
Gutmann's first implementation of MDC was in 1992; he's since switched to
SHA (Mark II, as of a week or two ago).  I don't know whether Peter's
switch to SHA was a result of the finding of pseudo-collisions in MD5, or
the longer bit string of SHA, or just what.

I suppose since crypto-strength hash functions are pretty new, figuring
out their strength as cipher engines would <have> to be pretty new.

   A nice exposition on the effect of using Carmichael numbers in PGP.
I personally think that it is a small risk, but I would think that a
(switchable if necessary) better primality tester in PGP would be a
nice improvement.

   BTW, to pick one nit:

In article <33ec7k$lg0@eis.calstate.edu> jomcgow@eis.calstate.edu (John S. McGowan) writes:

    x=1 and x congruent to -1 mod n are also trivial exceptions,
depending on the definition of multiplicative order that you use.
This has no effect on the arguments with respect to Carmichael
Numbers, but the n-1 mod n case is another gotcha to avoid when using
PGP, so it is worth noting here.  (Messages equal to zero, one or some
small integer are obviously something to avoid, but messages equal to
n-k for some small integer are not as obviously insecure.)

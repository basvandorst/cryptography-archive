soc.history.science has just been created. While most sites add new
Big 7 groups (such as soc.*) automatically, others add them only on user
request. So if the group has not been added to your site in the next
couple days write to your news administrator (write to the address news or
usenet) and ask that it be added.

The charter is as follows:

  soc.history.science will discuss the history of science in the broad sense:
  including the history of the physical sciences, history of the biological
  sciences, history of the social sciences, history of medicine, history of
  technology, history of mathematics, philosophy of science, and related
  areas.

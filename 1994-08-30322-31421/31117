Of course that does not mean that they don't use public key, or even  a
similar method as RSA, but which they invented themselves (maybe even
before RSA). But
anything on this topic is  speculation since NSA would not tell you
wnat they did use.

But they ( the Americans) did use Enigma type machines during the war
even though they knew everyone was working on them and that their allies
had broken that type of system. ( yes a bit more complex than true
Enigma- more wheels and rotors etc but the same type of thing) 
Crypto is only as good as the weakest link, and right now I would not
think that factoring is the weakest link ( but that may of course change
tomorrow)

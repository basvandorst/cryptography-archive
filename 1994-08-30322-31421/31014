Or, more generally, you form the signature of a compressed version of
the original.  And then authenticate slightly-altered images by first
compressing and then testing the compressed result against the
signature.  The reason why this won't work very well is that the
compression scheme dictates a fixed set of equivalence classes,
irrespective of the original image that generated the signature.  That
is, each equivalence class is the set of all images that compress to
the same bit pattern and consequently have the same signature.  So, two
images that are very close to one another may fall into different
equivalence classes (because they are near a boundary between two
classes) and therefore generate incompatible signatures.

The essential problem is that the class of acceptable images specified
by a signature should include all the images that are "close to" the
original, and no others.  This is what led me to pose the problem in
terms of a metric:

If you have a signed version of the original image then you can compare
the two by whatever means is appropriate for the application.  (String
distance is probably not very useful in most cases.)  It would be much
more interesting if you could "authenticate" a slightly-altered image,
given only a digital signature of the original.

I think maybe I was unclear in my original posting.  Here is an example
of how I think images need to be authenticated:

(1) Compute a "signature" of image A by a combination of image processing
and cryptography methods.  The length of the signature is much less than 
that of A.

(2) Pass image A through a non-secure and noisy channel and obtain image B.

(3) Check image B with the signature to determine if
    (a) B is the same as A;
    (b) B is reasonably close to A (within noise tolerance); or
    (c) B is significantly different from A.  (Maliciously altered?)

So, the cryptographic question is, given a class of (long) digital
messages, and some metric for that class, can you devise a (short)
signature that will allow you to test whether a given message is within
X (in terms of the metric) of the message that generated the signature?

Seeing as Crypto '94 is soon upon us, and there will be some of us who
cannot afford the time or expense of attending, would some kind sould who
will be attending the procedings post a quick summary of the events at the
conference?  Something a-la Bruce Schneier's posting from Eurocrypt earlier
this year?

I'm somewhat bummed that I won't be able to make it this year, since I'm
only a stone's throw away in San Luis Obispo, CA.  I was hoping to pick up
some ideas for my Master's Thesis which I'll be starting next quarter.

Again, much thanks to anyone who could post the highlights!

Can this be used safely as a minimal identification scheme?  Alice has
published as above.  To prove it is she, she responds to Bob's a^y with
a^(xy).  Bob can confirm this is (a^x)^y.  I have seen similar but more
complicated schemes in the literature but I wonder if there are weaknesses
with this one.

I would be interested in a reference to that paper, in March, when Phil
Zimmerman suggested using the SHA as a cypher, i did a periodicals search,
and could not come up with any papers on the subject?

It should also be noted that the strength of hashing functions is a
relatively new subject, with not that much research on. SHA was recently
found not to be as strong as specified, and a proposed modification has
been released by the U.S. Government. The upgrade to MDC-2, MDC-4, the
european standard has recently been shown to be less resistant to
Differential Statistical Cryptoanalysis
then MDC-2.

I am not sure as to how strengths in MDC functions correlate to their use
as cyphers and the strengths of these codes, but i would assume their is
some correlation?

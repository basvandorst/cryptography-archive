Would appreciate it if someone could point me to a factual description of 
the encryption used by ccMail. Am told that it is a RSA variant but this 
covers a lot of ground. Of particular interest is the following:

1) What is encrypted i.e. messages in transit ? Messages on server only ?

2) If messages in transit are encrypted, does this hold true between servers?

3) What about messages between servers when part of the transit is via the 
   Internet ?

4) How strong is the encryption used (know RSA varies with key length & US
   puts 40 bit limit on exported encryption).

5) How do servers exchange keys ? User terminals ? 

			Thank you for the help,

: False. RSA is patentable in Europe but cannot be patented because of prior
: publication. IDEA was patented in Europe.

Just to make this clear. Once you started to get a patent in one country in
the world by writing something to the patent office, you have 1 (one) year
to ask for the "world patent" or any other patent in a different country.
After this, your development is "state of the art" and no longer patentable.

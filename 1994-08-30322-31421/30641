lately i've become interested in the level of security actually provided by
the 900 mhz spread spectrum phones.  for instance, could a hacker with a
pc and a smattering of outboard hardware have a good chance of decoding one's
900MHz phone calls?

does anyone have any details on the ss systems used in, say, the escort
phones?  spreading sequence generator, moduation methods, synchronization
schemes, etc.?  one of the felows that i talked with at cincinnatti microwave
suggested that their phones choose a spreading sequence randomly whenever the
phone gets used.  is this true?

being a ham, i know that the fcc has allowed hams to use one of two linear
feedback shift register schemes to generate the spreading sequence for direct
sequence and frequency hopped systems.  this makes it extremely easy to
intercept a transmission.  if the phones were this vulnerable then it would
be difficult to make claims of security, eh?

also, since a lot of conversation time is "dead" time - mostly silence - does
this provide the attacker a rather simple way to get the spreading code?  i
am assuming that the digitized voice level is mixed with the spreading code
here - maybe someone who has more insight can comment on this method of attack.

if you've got the technical info, please pass it along.  i'll post a summary.

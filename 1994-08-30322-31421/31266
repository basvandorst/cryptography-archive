There is a program called WPcrak from CRAK Software which will 
automatically recover passwords fro WordPerfect files thru version 5.2.
The cost of this program is only $99 and is available in Windows and DOS 
versions.  The phone number for CRAK software is 602 863 9274.

A demo version is available from ftp.indirect.com  /pub/incoming.

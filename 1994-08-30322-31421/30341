But why would you be producing 6 bit symbols if your communications channel
takes 8 bit symbols? Is there some sort of efficiency gain that offsets the
cost of an additional compression run? Is it a good idea to keep the fiber
optics from feeling lonely by making sure that they constantly have bits
flowing through them? :-)

Well, there are some of us who were fourteen when you filed that patent
and have become interested in cryptography much more recently. (well at
least one, anyway) And I have missed any mention of your cipher in the
books and journal articles I have read since I first needed to use serious
cryptography for the program I am writting, so I am interested in the
details.

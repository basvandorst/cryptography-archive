"Applied Cryptography", Bruce Schneier. You should be able to order this

The search for rational values is under assault. Some have taken to
extremes the spurious notion of responsibility without freedom, and
are trying to erect moral guardrails to protect us from ourselves.
Those who try to find their own path are told: Stay between the lines;
the lines are our friends. Nothing is right any more (except, of course,
conservative expressions and authoritarian dogma).

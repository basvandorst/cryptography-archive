You don't seem to know much about how the RSA system patent, or patents
generally are written in this field.

Very likely there is hardware in the patent, in the "preferred embodiment",
including perhaps keyboard input, computer processing circuits, a
communications means at the input, and a communications means at the output.

Patents may be written narrowly or broadly. It is in the interests of the
applicant to write them as broadly as possible, and any good patent attorney
will do so. The patent office, based on prior art, etc. will grant broad
patents.

Most complaints about software patents are either made in ignorance, or
muddy the distinction between software which has no hardware component, or
all software.

If a Hagelin Converter is patentable in Europe, then so is RSA. That it
substitutes computer code for part of the hardware is irrelevant.

Being in the middle of four patent applications (the first of which I'm told
is going to be granted), I can tell you that one can list "an input means"
with preferred embodiments and encompass many different kinds of hardware.
Similarly, "an output means" is the same.

If you can find a way to do RSA cryptography without any input or output,
chances are you might not infringe the patent, but trust me, the hardware
aspect is a non-issue.

Putting it another way, if a radio set using analogue tuning is patentable,
so is a radio set using digital tuning. The RSA patent is a system patent,
which encompasses the inputs and outputs as well as the transformations. In
that sense it is NOT purely a software patent, and any rules against pure
software patents don't apply to the RSA patent.

Thus I have little doubt that if it were not prevented by the prior
publication issue, RSA would be fully patentable in Europe as the U.S.
patent is drafted. So would any other crypto system embodying an algorithm
other than those already covered.

My guess is that in the real world, limitations against software patents
apply only to simple kernels, such as a sort algorithm. Even then, if you
can develop a new sorting algorithm, you can probably write up a valid
patent application in which one of the preferred embodiments of the sorting
process is in hardware, and hardware is used for inputs and outputs. The
algorithm itself may not be patentable, but a patent attorney worth his salt
will write the application up in such a way that there is no feasible way to
use the sort algorithm without infringing, because of the generality of the
hardware parts of the "sorting system" or process patent. (Again, if you can
find a way to sort without any inputs or outputs you might not infringe.)

Usual caveat. I'm not an attorney but I take advice from them. I'm working
on patent attorney drafts of a number of patents I participate in now, and
have done so in the past.

I think that this would not be possible, as write protect tabs exist.
Also, nothing prevents the codebreaker to just make raw copy of crypted
disk or write own program to decrypt it wich had no destruct sequence.

However, there could be some use to "hot key" for scrambling disk
permanently as last-ditch measure when cops are "knocking" at the door, and
you want to avoid being subpoenaed by court to open them. This could also 
be programmed to crash computer after destruct sequence to wipe any 
data remaining in memory. With floppies this would not be so useful, but
if you crypt hard drive, this could work. 

Any ideas??

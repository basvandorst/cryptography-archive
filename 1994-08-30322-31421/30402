Forgive me if this has already been answered...
My father-in-law took out the original poster's name.  But at my request,

John Hassebroek replies (FidoNet is soooo slow):
: >I'm writing an article about RSA-129, and the science magazine
: >asked what the german translation of the decrypted message
: >
: >"The magic words are 'SQUEAMISH OSSIFRAGE'"
: >is. Can anybody tell me what "ossifrage" is, all other
: >words are known, but what the hell is that OSSIFRAGE.
:
:OSSIFRAGE is the name of a bird of prey: The Bone-breaker from
:OSSI: bone(s) and FRAGE: breaking (latin)
:
:Synonym of Osprey/Fishhawk or GEIR EAGLE
:
:In 1602 in Holland Ossifrage was referred to as AEGLE (no not misspelled)
:BTW this miserable (my comment) bird had the audacity to drop its prey
:on the rocks to give him/her a headstart on the bone-breaking business!
:(Something like a credit-agency collector........?) Hope this helps/JOHN

I don't know if that helps the orignal poster or not.  Perhaps there's
a link between "breaker" of bones and of codes!

Summary: Looking for a book published by former Crypto Salesman on bugging equip
Keywords: Crypto, Book, Iran, Bugs, Backdoor

A book was allegedly published earlier this year by a former salesman of 
Crypto AG (Switzerland), of things that (allegedly) Crypto AG had done to 
equipment sold 
to customers to compromise it.  I am looking for a title and publisher of 
this book, and if anyone knows where it might be found.

The salesman was allegedly caught in Iran for over a year after the 
Iranians found out what the company had done, and (also allegedly) paid 
about 1 million dollars to get him out.
In gratitude, he published some dirty little secrets (allegedly)

Any assistance on the title, author and publisher and even a bookstore 
would be appreciated.

Thanks.

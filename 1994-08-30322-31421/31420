I disagree.  The comma could perform the function you tried to assign
to it only if the author had added another predicate to the end of
his sentence.  But he didn't, so it can't.  Moreover, the comma *does*
have a *perfectly legitimate* function to perform; paired with the
subsequent full stop, it parenthesizes the enclosed text.  To my ear,
the effect is to reduce the importance of that text a little. 

Regardless of who approves of it or not, many writers often use pairs
of commas, or a comma and a subsequent stronger stop, to parenthesize
the second of a pair of noun phrases joined by a conjunction.  I have
just been guilty of it myself in the preceding sentence.  I also
believe I can cite any number of examples you like from the pens of
acknowledged masters of English prose. 

>   ...... but it [punctuation] can significantly change meaning  ...

This is certainly true, even of the humble comma; but the *meaning*
of *the sentence in question* is only minutely affected by the comma
it contains.  *Readability* is another matter.  It is quite possible
that the comma may mislead some readers, and require them to re-read
the sentence before they will understand it.  But if this effort is
too much for them, I suggest it does them no credit to accuse its
author of writing "gibberish".

Since this is now well off the topic of this newsgroup, I have directed
followups to alt.grammar.punctuation.disputes.silly (i.e. me).

As someone who knows nothing about the mathematics of encryption, 
I have only one question: is there any freeware (PGP?) that
incorporates the "Military RSA" that is being discussed?  

Perhaps a second question: is the difference between "Military RSA"
and "not Military" RSA simply a matter of key size?  Does PGP
encrypt data in a way that would allow one to have the same security
provided to the military?   Is it simply a matter of specifying a
larger key size when using PGP?  Or are we talking about a level
of security not available to we, the public?

Enough newbie questions for now.  If anybody has the patience to
give me a quick answer via e-mail, I'd be happy to hear form
you.

Regards, 

Paul

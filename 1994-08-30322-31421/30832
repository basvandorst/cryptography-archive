If you recall, the first version of cc:Mail that used encryption was
*broken* by a hacker who caused great embarassment to cc:Mail
(before Lotus bought them).  They swore that no hacker would do that
again. Thus they did a fair bit of confidential research about four years
ago to at least strengthen the encryption algorithms at little loss of
performance.

The question is: how do you thwart hackers while permitting NSA access?
The obvious answer is strong algorithm(s) and relatively truncated keys.


Of course regular readers of sci.crypt realize that a strong crypto
algorithm does not by itself make a strong overall messaging system,
but sure does up the ante for casual hacker-style attacks.

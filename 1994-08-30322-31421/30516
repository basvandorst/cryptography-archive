There was an talk on this topic at either the Crypto 92 or 93 conf-
erence, I forget which.  It is available in the proceedings.

The method used was similar to the idea here of encrypting with a public
key and requiring factoring of the modulus to decrypt.  But the author
had more techniques he used, iterating functions forward which would take
longer to iterate backwards.  The purpose was to give a more predictable
time to decrypt.

One problem with this is that it does not so much put a time floor on
the decryption, but rather a cost floor.  Someone who is willing to spend
enough can decrypt faster than someone who spends less.  Another problem
is the difficulty of forecasting the growth of computational power per
dollar in the future.

Easiest way to do this is to simply delete them.  

Trouble is, (unlike many think), when you delete data from your hard drive,
it doesn't go away very easily.  The directory entries for it may be removed,
and you may even overwrite the space with something else, but there will be 
still magnetic traces of your data on the disks.  The spooks have been known to
go after your disk with a microscope and "read" the data this way (sounds 
far-fetched, I know, but according to many folks this IS possible.)  

The only way to prevent this sort of thing in software is to repeatedly 
overwrite the file in question with random garbage, and/or selected patterns of
1s and 0s, in order to "get rid of" any traces of the data.  There are programs
that do this.  However, you cannot be 100% sure.  (Also, there may be traces of
your file elsewhere on the disk...)


The only way to be 100% sure that your data is not read is to destroy the disk.
(Would a high-intensity magnetic field work???)

Interesting question.  Can a judge order an individual to provide the 
cryptographic keys for encrypted data, on pain of contempt?  Or does this
violate the 5th amendment (assuming the data belongs to the individual in
question, and may incriminate him/her)?  What if it is unknown (by the court)
whether or not the block of random data in question is an encrypted file or
not?  The technical aspects of this (disguising ciphertext, including 
innocuous, "false" ciphertext to be "decrypted" at such a request) have been
much discussed around here, but the legal aspects have not.  (Ignore, for now,
the spectre of certain three-letter agencies using extralegal means to extract
such information.)

First, I want to give some gratuitous advice to the general readership:
In trn, /strnlght@netcom.com/fcK:j      I suspect from the general lack
of flame that most of you have Sternlight squelched already.

To David Sternlight:

I myself am a "lay person", and I'm highly offended by your attitude
that laymen are helpless slugs. I can follow most of what I've seen
here. The last thing I want is for sci.* groups to be dumbed down so
that they don't make the "mythical stupid lay person" uncomfortable. Do
me a favor and _don't do me any favors_.

        Tom

PS: Told any good lies in support of Clipper recently?

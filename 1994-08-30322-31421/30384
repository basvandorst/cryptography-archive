We're talking about subtly different shades of meaning.  There is nothing
about RSA which makes it inherently unpatentable.  It could have been
patented if it hadn't been published first.  But European patent law
prohibits the patenting of published works.  Therefore RSA is unpatentable
only because it was published, not because it is inherently unpatentable. 
If PKP had applied for a European patent before publishing, they probably
would have gotten it.

Another mindless Stern-bash, it would seem.  Let's try not to get too
picky, folks, or turn DS's words against him just to have an excuse to
insult him.  I know he's the favorite whipping boy around here (I won't
say one way or the other whether that is deserved), but twisting his own
words against him just to put him down doesn't accomplish anything except
to make a few childish people feel better.  His explanation did make
sense, although it was a bit terse and could have been expounded upon.

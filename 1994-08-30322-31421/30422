I wouldn't trust any dice that weren't platonic solids
(4, 6, 8, 12, 20 sides) to be "fair".  It's hard enough
to properly manufacture balanced platonic solids.

Try 20-sided dice, with the convention that each digit (0-9)
is placed on two faces instead.  You're much more likely to
find a balanced die.

Despite my previous comments, this is probably your best bet,
as the manufacture of "fair" 6-sided dice has been studied
a lot more than other options.

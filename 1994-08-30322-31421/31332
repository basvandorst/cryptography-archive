                Conference Highlights
                ---------------------

Building on last year's highly successful inaugural conference, we are
pleased to invite your participation in this year's conference. The
purpose of the conference is to bring together researchers and
practitioners of computer and communications security. As evidenced by
the program, the conference offers a unique blend of cryptography and
security, theory and practice, with emphasis on the practical. The
conference will be held in the Holiday Inn, Fair Oaks, in Fairfax,
Virginia; minutes from the Nation's Capital. We welcome you to enjoy
an informative and invigorating program, and Washington's pleasant
mid-fall sight-seeing weather.

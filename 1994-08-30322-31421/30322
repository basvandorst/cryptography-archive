Does anyone know if there is any problem with using Diffie-Hellman as
a public key encryption method, as opposed to a key exchange method?
I.e., all users of the system share a common modulus P and generator
g; for a public key, generate a secret X and publish g^x mod P;
someone wanting to send you a secret message chooses a random y and
sends you g^y mod P followed by an encrypted message using g^(xy) mod
P as the session key per usual DH.  Of course this doesn't do digital
signatures (use El Gamal) but are there any security problems aside
from brute force precomputation of a giant log table?

I think Koblitz's book may have discussed this method briefly.
Certainly it's a pretty obvious idea.  I'm wondering why people
normally think of DH as being only for key exchange.

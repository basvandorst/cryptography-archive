I would like to have more time to respond to the many questions that you
have posed in your article on PGP math. However, here are some with which
I have experience:
	1. PGP or RSA will work just fine with one or two Carmichael numbers
in fact, you can construct a viable RSA system with any (strong) pseudoprimes
and also (yes!) wit composite numbers that are "weak" pseudoprimes. All
moduli used in RSA are "weak" pseudoprimes!.
	2. Carmichael numbers can have many factors and not necessarily
small. I suggest an article by Pinch in Math.Comp. 1994.
	3. If a system is constructed with a Carmichael number (say, only
one) you can then construct a "dummy" RSA by forming a new modulus and using
the original, target modulus as one of the "primes". You then will have
a complete set of parameters for the new, "dummy" system and you can factor
it and the target modulus with ease!
	I and many other individuals have and still are laboring over the
idea of factoring large moduli using this "tenderizing" technique. While
I had some successes with it works only spotily so that the search goes on...

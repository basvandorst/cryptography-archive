Geez.  The original purpose of VCR+ was to save the user from the
inconvenience/complication of entering the start, duration, date
etc. of a show directly on his/her VCR.  Now they transfer that
inconvenience/complication to a new model of their remote unit.
Why would anyone want such a thing, rather than just programming
their VCR directly?

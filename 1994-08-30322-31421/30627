But doesn't this illustrate the confusion?  No one is disputing what kind
of *US* patent it is.  But being considered a "system patent" in the US
doesn't make it one in the UK or EU.

I have seen that Bill Larkins has declined to comment on the PKP patent.  I
am disappointed, but fully understand his reasons.  However is he able to
comment on the more general point of the different interpretations of
"software patent" in different (non-US) jurisdictions?  In particular is
he able to confirm that certain patents might be regarded as "system
patents" in the US and as "software patents" in the UK?

Could be. The RSA patent is, under this definition a process patent because
it transforms the characters/bits/electrons of a plaintext message into
those of the encrypted one and vice-versa. That's why it is valid even where
"algorithm" patents are not, having been written in terms of a
system/process patent.

The values that define our common-sense world are under assault. Some have
taken to extremes the spurious notion of freedom without responsibility, and
are trying to tear down moral guardrails. Those who live on the shoulders
are told by their pals that they are in the middle of the road. Nothing is
wrong any more (except, of course, conservative thoughts and expressions).

I believe the courts have taken the position that they can order you to
release all keys or other items necessary to decrypt anything you have
encrypted.  If necessary, the judge would give you immunity for prosecution
for the contents of the key itself, but not items encrypted with the keys.
i.e. if the key is "stealcows", they wouldn't be able to use the fact that
your password was "stealcows" against you in a cattle rustling case, but
they could use the password to decrypt your data and then use your data against
you.

You may or may not agree with this interpretation, but they have big guys with
guns who will take you away to jail if you disobey.

There are two basic approaches to duress codes - one that causes the
cryptosystem to generate bogus data if given the wrong key,
and one that causes the system to actually trash the data if given the
duress key.  The latter is less useful, since it relies on them using
your working system; the main conditions under which they'd have to
use it are systems using obscurity hardware like smart cards,
or software that requires changing a block on the disk after each use,
perhaps some variant on S-Key which uses a different key each time,
and stores each password used to compare with a hash of the next password.

One approach for generating bogus data that might be useful is Peter
Wayner's Mimic Functions, which use their input to drive a grammar
that produces arbitrarily realistic-looking random prose.  If they
give it the right key, it generates the right stuff, otherwise nonsense.

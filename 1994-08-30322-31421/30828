David, I see you don't will or you aren't able to see the difference
between a hardware solution and the emulation of it on a computer.

The IDEA patent is relevant, if you build a chip or similar.
As one said before, and that's my knowledge too, the implementation
of IDEA on a computer isn't covered by such a patent since it is
in at least in Germany impossible.

As I said multiple times before, the implementation on a PC is not
patentable nor covers any existand patent ond hopefully in future too
the implemantation of a method on a computer.

However, and that is true, if you put a computer in a frigo for the purpose
to control the temperature and you use IDEA to protect you configuration,
this may be covered by the patent, since the computer isn't use as a
computer, it is used as a controller instead.

hope clarified something,
	Ralf

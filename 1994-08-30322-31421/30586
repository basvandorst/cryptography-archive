Oh well, I was just thinking about quick way of making encrypted messages
impossible to decrypt even with correct key. I did not intend to sound
so ravingly paranoid, just thinking way to honestly tell "I cannot" 
to judge on case of "open it or go to jail for contempt" order.
Rather paranoid feature, but interesting problem to think about.

Hey experts; Am I right assuming that if CBF-IDEA encrypted message
is damaged, decrypting remaining message is practically impossible 
after damage? Or perhaps simple Zapping of FAT would do the trick.

destroyed.)

No, I don't think it is misleading, from a global point of view.  First,
other people in this newsgroup can (and have done) elaborate on Bob's
statement and explain some of the less obvious points.

Second, have you proved that there exists no polynomial-time algorithm for
integer factorization?  If you haven't, then Bob's statement is not
misleading even in a practical sense.

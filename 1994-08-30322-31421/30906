	The one-time pad is the only cipher that is unbreakable if used
properly. However, it is in most cases impractical to use. One day I read
an article about quantum cryptography and I immediately started to think
about a true one-time pad, a storage device which can only be read once.
In other words, it should be impossible to read the device without causing
damage to the data. If some eavesdropper decides to get the key, the key
will turn out to be useless for its legitimate user. 

	By applying quantum mechanics it should theoretically be possible
to construct such a storage device. Here is a suggestion:

	A container representing one bit of the key:

	--------------|---------------
	|                            | 
        | a particle                 |
        |     P                      |
	|                            |
	--------------|---------------

	A very small particle with zero momentum is contained in one half
of the small container. The particle should be appropriately chosen such
that when measuring its position it will gain momentum and move freely
in the container (the destruction of the data). The position of the 
particle in the box will determine if the bit is 1 or 0. However, if the
particle has gained momentum, it will behave randomly and the data can no
longer be recovered.

	I would like to hear suggestions on read-once storage devices.

	If you have ftp access, you can ftp to rsa.com. They should have
some documents on RSA. It is worth to take a look at the pkcs series. They
contain the RSA standard with all the block formating and padding which is
necessary for RSA. It seems that there is no source code for encryption
at rsa.com. However, there are some C listings of the MD algoritms.

	As far as I know export laws do not concern authentification schemes,
and they should thus be freely available. However, with RSA the difference
between encryption and digital signatures is neglible, since software which
can sign digitally can easily be rewritten to perform encryption.

	Furthermore, a brief description of the RSA algorithm is written in
the sci.crypt FAQ.

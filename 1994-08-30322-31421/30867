An aside...(which, of course, a moderator would crop but which is
begging to be stated)...

A large number of people in the world do not write English as well as
some of us natives.  Please do not let flames about other folks poor use 
of the language keep you from posting.

(This post would never make it past the grammar/spelling censors if I had
to post it in French, German or Spanish :)

Most of us try to be polite and considerate.  Don't be embarassed if you
may not be as clear as you would be in your native language.  Post if you
have something to contribute to the discussion, even if it may not be in
the proper King's English (which damn few of us use outside of school 
anyway ;)

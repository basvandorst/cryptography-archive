If you want another example, remember Prohibition. If ENOUGHT people 
get involved, then Craig's argument holds. If a small minority are 
involved, then Martin's analogy is more correct.  So work on getting 
51% of the adult American populace to demand the right to personal 
electronic communication privacy worldwide, and the government will 
cave in. Else.... forget it. The government will make and enforce the 
rules, even if you hate them.

I'd start this note off with "gentlemen", but the term only applies
to Vesselin (sometimes).  Take this forgery garbage and less than amusing 
childish name calling to e-mail.  Vesselin, you're playing this inept forger's
games when you respond.  You, at least, should have some restraint and show 
some professionalism.  While I am not a computer network expert, I am sure that
there are some here who would not mind finding and posting the real e-mail
address of this forger.  I believe that honest public exposure will do more
towards stopping this immature child than anything else.  
jna.

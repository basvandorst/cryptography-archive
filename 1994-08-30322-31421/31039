   :Well I sent a formula to you by email but since you apparently either
   :did not receive it or read it, here it is
   :#operations is of order exp(1.9 (L)^(1/3)(ln(L))^(2/3) ) for the "best"
   :the Number Field Sieve, for large numbers- L is the length in bits I
   :believe.

   This is incorrect. If L is the length in bits then N ~ 2^L.
   The run time is

   O((1.9 + o(1)) (log N)^1/3 (log log N)^2/3)

   Your forgot the o(1) term [it is important for real problems]
   and log(2^L)  does NOT equal L. It equals  L log 2. You are missing
   two instances of log2 in your exponent. This is the natural logarithm.

   Finally, this is (essentially) a deterministic run time and does
   not answer the question about "probability of cracking in time t"
   [which is basically gibberish. If t is fixed, then it either is 
   or is not sufficient to factor a number of given size. There is no
   "probability"]

First of all, I would like to point out that mean-spirited, insulting posts
have no place in this newsgroup.  Secondly, since you are so up on what is
what isn't meaningless I suppose you can explain how your answer has any
meaning what-so-ever.  Giving the order of the problem in no way tells
anyone how long the algorithm is going to take.  Maybe with a sample time
from an arbitrary machine, but not without any reference to a computer.
Finally, the "probability of cracking in time t" has definite meaning for
any algorithm that is not entirely deterministic.  I suppose you have never
used a Monte Carlo method and have no knowledge of statistics.

I hope, for your sake, Mitre Corporation pays no attention to the excellent
publicity you are giving their company.

P.S. Consider yourself led.

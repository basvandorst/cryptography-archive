This means that no matter how good the generators are, you can
compute the entire output of each of them using approx. 9*2^16 bytes of
known plaintext-ciphertext by writing out the corresponding
logic equations and solving them by Gaussian elimination.
Doesn't sound like much of a DES replacement yet.

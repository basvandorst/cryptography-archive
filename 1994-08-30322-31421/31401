There is already a hardware implementation to do 1024-bit RSA (made in
France).  It can do about 50kbits/second of encryption for a small
exponent with a clock rate (as I recall) of 20MHz.  I lost the
reference, but here is a slower one from 1986:

    From the advance program for the Custom Integrated Circuits
    Conference,  Rochester NY, May 12-15 1986, page 39:

    A Fast Asynchronous RSA Encryption Chip

    G. Orton, L.E.  Peppard, S.E.  Tavares, Queen's Univ., Kingston,
    Ontario, Canada

    This RSA key encryption chip uses asynchronous modulo multiplication
    to improve the throughput by a factor of 40 relative to a
    synchronous implementation.  The chip is capable of an average
    throughput of 40 Kbit/sec for 512 bit encryption with a 2-micron
    CMOS process and a 1 square cm die area.

I have been keeping an eye out for other hardware implementations, but
have seen none since about 1988.  Going by the increase of the speed of
processors during that time, it should now be possible to build chips
ten times faster.  Note that decryption with a large exponent will take
longer than encryption with a small exponent, with the ratio of times
about proportional to the number of bits in the exponent, so that the
decryption rate for a 1024-bit exponent will be roughly 500 times slower
than encryption.

Due to technical difficulties with the currently proposed submission address
for sci.crypt.research postings, there still exists a need for a submission 
site in case the vote passes.  What this would involve is the creation of an 
address crypt-request@<sitename> which would forward all mail sent to it to 
the moderators, preferably without adding dozens of lines of headers.  This 
shouldn't be too hard using <insert favourite scripting language here, eg 
perl>, all you need to do is mail submissions out to the moderators in a 
round-robin fashion.
 
Having the submission address here isn't really possible because (1) the 
mail system we use is weird, and (2) having all of sci.crypt.research 
flowing through our overseas link three times per article is probably 
unhealthy.
 
The prerequisites for the submission site are:
 
  - It should be outside the US.
  - It should have a reliable internet connection(s).
  - It should be a site which will be around for a long time to come.
  - It should come pre-installed with someone capable of setting up the
    remailing system.
 
If anyone would like to volunteer, could they let me know by yesterday?
Thanks.
 
Peter.

The Applied Cryptography disks contain many packages that came from
the Internet, and Mr. Shneier has done us a great service in
collecting the materials on the disks.  He posted the list of items
on the disk, and several people have contributed pointers to sites on
the Internet with the original material.

The HTML page I mentioned has links to those sites.  It doesn't have a
site for everything on the disks, and no one (to my knowledge) has
put the contents of the disks in one package for anonymous FTP.

Oh, and I bought the disks, too.

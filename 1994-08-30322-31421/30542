I am looking for either pascal, modula2, or pseudo-code for the
public/private key encryption algorithm

I think I saw it in a book published by TIME once, but have no idea of the
title.

Any help in either the book title, or even the code (this would be better)
would be greatly appreciated

Thanks in advance
Jimbo

	"Cryptanalysis" by Helen Fouche Gaines (available from
	Dover Books) has all of these tables for English and some of
	them for several  other European languages, I believe that they
	are also to be found in some of the old cryptography texts published 
	by Aegean Park (I can't remember which titles off-hand).  You
	will come across one of the major problems with these tables
	when you read Gaines: English style and word use changes
	over the years and with the subject matter.  For example, 
	"xyl," "qui," "yli," and "zyl" are common trigrams in organic
	chemistry (and botany) but almost never found in the
	pages of general publications.  It is because of this that the
	FAQ recommends making your own tables for the sort of
	documents you are interested in.  I've done this by hand and it's
	a  dull job, but I have seen lines of C code that will do it too.

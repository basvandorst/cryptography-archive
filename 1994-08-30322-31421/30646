: No, I don't think it is misleading, from a global point of view.

And you think beginners take this global point of view ?  Get
a grip.

Note my reference to wasting people's time.  There are a lot of rumors
and misconceptions out there.  For example, several posters to this
thread seem to think inverting RSA is know to be as hard as factoring.

What are you talking about Albert ?  Bob's joke post claimed the rumor
of RSA being cracked was true, not that claims of its security are
unproven.

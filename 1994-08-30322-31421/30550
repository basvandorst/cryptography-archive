        To be precise, this proves they hold a message encoded with
        the secret key. For proof, you need an unpredictable message,
        not of their choosing, encrypted with the secret key.

        In any case, "zero knowledge proof" usually refers to a more
        general-purpose application. Something like being able to
        prove that I have a license to drive a motorcycle without
        revealing my name or driver's license number. Public key is a
        highly restricted instance of a more general concept.

        Cheers,

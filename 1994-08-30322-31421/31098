I too am puzzled by your repeated assertions that the indicated sentence
is gibberish and incomplete.  I had no trouble understanding it; here is
the way I read it:

 Subject :  A 128 bit key

 Verb :     has been broken

 Adverbial complements: 1) this way
                        2) using the internet and anyone interested in
                           taking part. 

The second adverbial complement is introduced by the participle
"using", which governs a compound object consisting of the noun
phrases "the internet" and "anyone interested in taking part",
joined by the conjunction "and".  I should be interested to
know what more anyone thinks is needed to complete the sentence.

Robert Silverman again:
>I was not criticizing grammar, but failure to communicate clearly ...

Communication can fail because of defects in the receiver as well as the
transmitter.

It seems to me that distinguishing between noise and malicious altering 
is a very difficult thing, even if some kind of cryptographic metric of 
alteration is possible.

At a practical level, on solution might be to transmit the image, along 
with a smaller image which would allow a human to visually detect 
tampering (people are still the best pattern recognizers).  The smaller 
image could be accompanied by enough error-correcting information to 
ensure exact transmission over lines of whatever s/n ratio is relevant.  
A standard cryptographic hash could accompany the small (reference) image.

Of course, one can also error-correct a large image, so that might be a 
relevant solution also.  But the extra band-width required for full 
error-correction might be greater.

Yours, Lulu...

Don't expect ANY generally available commercial program in the US to
be secure.  The US Govt classifies strong encryption as munitions
(thats right, encryption is as dangerous as an anti-tank gun).  Hence
anyone exporting it can get done for arms dealing, and be put in the
clink for 20 years.  Software firms want to support and distribute one
version, and they want all those versions to be able to exchange data.
So everyone gets the lowest common denominator.

Cue the Clipper argument.

Paul.

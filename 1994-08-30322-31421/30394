Can anyone point me to the best place to get a good definition and
analysis of the meaning of randomness in _finite_ sequences?  It
would be especially helpful if the source also focused on the
special requirements of cryptography, eg, resistance to
cryptanalysis, lack of local nonrandomness, etc.

Knuth's Seminumerical Algorithms is a good resource for the meaning
of randomness when speaking of _infinite_ sequences, but seems
sketchy when discussing finite sequences.  It also does not speak
to cryptographic issues.

TIA.

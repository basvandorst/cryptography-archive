Here are two sources I have for good explanations of Miller-Rabin:

"Introduction to Algorithms" by Rivest, Cormen, Leiserson; pp. 839-841.
"Factorization and Primality Testing" by Bressoud; pp. 75-78.

Now, I've always heard the Lucas-Lehmer test specifically referring to
testing Mersenne numbers for primality.  It only works on Mersenne
numbers, so while it is an interesting test, it doesn't really help in
the general case.

However, a test for primality based on a theorem essentially due to
the same Lucas is explained on pp. 130-133 of Bressoud's book, or try
"Elementary Number Theory and It's Applications" by Rosen, pp.
308-310.  This is the real Lucas test, based on primitive roots.  It
tends to be slow, mainly because you need to know the factorization of
n-1 to test n for primality.

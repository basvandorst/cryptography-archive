I need a European copy for a client of mine with European subsidiaries.
I have looked in all of the standard Macintosh ftp servers, can't find
it.

I do !*NOT*! want anybody to illegally remove this from the US.

Vesselin said he would put it on his server if I can find a European
copy.

Thanks for your help.

Lew.

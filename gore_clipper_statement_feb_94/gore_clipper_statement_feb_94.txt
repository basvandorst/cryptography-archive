STATEMENT OF THE VICE PRESIDENT


Today's announcements on encryption represent important steps in 
the implementation of the Administration's policy on this critical 
issue. Our policy is designed to provide better encryption to 
individuals and businesses while ensuring that the needs of law 
enforcement and national security are met.

Encryption is a law and order issue since it can be used by criminals 
to thwart wiretaps and avoid detection and prosecution. It also has 
huge strategic value. Encryption technology and cryptoanalysis 
turned the tide in the Pacific and elsewhere during World War II.

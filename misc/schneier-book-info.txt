The book is out!  I received my copy last Friday, and copies are speeding to
bookstores even as I type.  It will take a few more weeks for them to get
overseas.

My suggestion is that if you want a copy, order it from your local technical
bookstore.  Information is below:

	TITLE:  APPLIED CRYPTOGRAPHY
	        PROTOCOLS, ALGORITHMS, AND SOURCE CODE IN C
	AUTHOR:  Bruce Schneier
	PUBLISHER:  John WIley & Sons
	ISBN:  0-471-59756-2
	PRICE:  $44.95

Some people have seen it advertised at a lower price.  My editor assures me
that no one will get it at that price, but my advice is to make a stink and
see what happens.  The advertisement I saw with a $40 price had no "prices
are subject to change without notice" clause.  Just don't tell them I told
you so.

[Can be ordered by phoning 1-800-ALL-BOOK.]

Bruce

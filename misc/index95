``A Cryptographic Mechanism for Object-Instance-based
Authorization in Object-Oriented Database Systems''


ABSTRACT
The paper suggests a mechanism for access control at the
instance level of a class in object-oriented databases.
The mechanism is based on the use of pseudorandom functions
and sibling intractable functions. Each object instance
is associated with access keys that ensure secure access
to the object and all other related to it objects.
The authorization system supports ownership and granting/revoking
of access rights.

``Security Issues on the Internet''

ABSTRACT
The paper presents an overview of security issues
in the Internet. First security threats are discussed.
Next some general issues of access control are considered
with firewalls as a special case of the access control
which allow to separate parts of the internet using
packets screening techniques.
Two solutions of firewals are shown, one based on so-called
cryptographic tickets and the other based on a network security probe.
Later a discussion on intrusion detection systems follows.
The last part of the paper shows how to distribute
cryptographic keys via insecure channels (Internet).

``Practical message authentication schemes''

ABSTRACT
Use of encryption algorithms in message authentication is replaced by secure
hash functions which are often faster than encryption algorithms.
Tsudik has proposed three methods on message authentication
which are only based on one-way hash functions and use some keys to make them
secure.  In this paper, we give a set of practical methods, each of which
uses a fast collision free hash function (such as MD5) and provides secure
message authentication. The idea of the proposed methods is almost similar
to that of Tsudik's, but we are able to reduce the key length eight times
compared to the Tsudik's constructions, while maintaining the same
security.  In our methods, the secret key is added using exclusive-or or
assign operators (instead of concatenation) to make them faster.  We also
have proved that our methods belong to the Secure Keyed One-Way Hash
Function (SKOWHF) group, if the underlying hash function is secure.

``Kuperee Simplified''

ABSTRACT
In this current work we simplify the authentication protocol
of Kuperee by removing all its features and presenting it
in the minimum form required to achieve authentication in the Kerberos manner.
This minimal form of Kuperee facilitates the further modification
of the various parameters of Kuperee to achieve different effects,
taking advantage of the fact that underlying Kuperee is a public-key
cryptosystem which allows for various key compositions.
Two approaches for authentication in Kuperee are discussed.
The first relies on the sharing of a session secret-public key pair
much in manner of the Needham-Schroeder protocol.
The second approach is based on the use of a group-shared
longer term public-key, which exploits the nature of the public key
cryptosystem employed.

``Computer Intrusion Detection: A Comparative Survey''

ABSTRACT
Advances in computer and communication technologies have resulted in highly
integrated distributed systems that allow users to access information
and resources from all over the globe. By introducing many more possible
attacking points, this interconnectivity adds new dimensions to the long
standing problem of providing security in a computer system. Rapid increase
in the number of reported intrusions, break-ins and computer thefts results
in an ever-increasing need for applying effective computer security measures.
The number of recently developed, or under development systems and
tools that can be used for detection of abuse of computer systems
is growing.
In this report we present a comparative review of the state-of-the-art
intrusion detection systems (IDS) and methods, underlining the
strength and limitations of each.  We also suggest
directions for future development and research.

``A Model of Content-based Authorization in Object-Oriented
  Databases based on Object Views''


ABSTRACT
Several models of authorization have been proposed for object-oriented
databases supporting different levels of granularity. However, these models
do not support authorization based on database contents and context. A way
of handling  context and content-dependent authorization is by using views.
In this paper, we present a model of authorization, based on  a view model
proposed by Bertino \cite{Bert92}, that supports content-based access control
on instances of a class.

`` Pseudorandom Sequences obtained from
   Expansions of Irrational Numbers''

ABSTRACT
The main challenge in stream cipher design is to produce sequences
that appear random.  A number of keystream generators
have been proposed and considered in the literature (several of
those have been broken).  The common characteristic
of these keystream generators is that the obtained sequences are periodic.
This paper proposes a novel method for the generation of pseudorandom
sequences.  The method is based on the expansion of irrational numbers.
In contrast to previous methods, our method produces non-periodic sequences.
It will be shown that  binary sequences obtained from
the expansions of irrational numbers behave randomly.
In other words, the output sequences are indistinguishable from the
truly random sequences.  The advantages of our method, in contrast to
the truly random generators (like tossing a coin), is that the sequences
can be reproduced.  The output of this pseudorandom generator
is provably unpredictable provided the attacker does not know the secret seed.

``Cryptosystems for Hierarchical Groups''

ABSTRACT
This paper addresses the problem of information protection
in hierarchical groups. Higher level groups of participants can
control the information flow (the decryption ability) to lower level groups.
If a higher level group decides to allow a lower level group to read
the message, it passes a go ahead ticket so the lower level
group can decrypt the cryptogram and read the message.
The formal model of top-down hierarchical cryptosystems
is given.  Two practical and efficient schemes are described.
The first is based on the ElGamal system.  The second applies the RSA system.
In proposed schemes the dealer publishes a public key such that an individual
can use it to send an encrypted message to the (hierarchical) group.
Publication of both the group public key and the encryption
method does not reveal the decision of the group.
The lack of verifiability of retrieved messages
in threshold ElGamal cryptosystems is also discussed.

`` Dynamic Threshold Cryptosystems''

ABSTRACT
A new concept in group oriented cryptography -- {\it the dynamic
threshold cryptosystem} -- is presented in the paper.
The dynamic system has many advantages over the existing
threshold cryptosystems.
It is set up by the sender who can not only compose
the group of recipients but select the threshold as well.
Implementations of the dynamic system based on the ElGamal
and the RSA public key cryptosystems are given and their
properties are discussed.
The proposed solutions are practical and non-interactive.
There is no need for trusted dealers or tamper proof modules.
The generalization of the concept for an arbitrary access
structure concludes the paper.

``Distributed Delegation Systems''

ABSTRACT
In this paper we introduce unconditionally secure distributed delegation
systems that allow groups of participants to collectively authorize
a delegate to sign a message (construct an authentic message) on their behalf.
We propose a model and investigate its properties when delegation
is valid for one transmission. The model is extended to multiple
delegation and constructions with more economical key exchange are proposed.

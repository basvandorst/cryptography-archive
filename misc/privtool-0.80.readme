	Privtool Beta Release	@(#)README.1ST	1.8 6/30/94
	-----------------------------------------------------

Privtool is intended to be a PGP-aware replacement for the standard Sun
Workstation mailtool program, with a similar user interface and
automagick support for PGP-signing and PGP-encryption. Just to make
things clear, I have written this program from scratch, it is
*not* a modified mailtool (and I'd hope that the Sun program code
is much cleaner than mine 8-) !). 

When the program starts up, it displays a list of messages in your 
mailbox, along with flags to indicate whether messages are signed 
or encrypted, and if they have had their signatures verified or 
have been decrypted.

When you double click on a message, it will be decrypted (requesting
your passphrase if neccesary), and/or will have the signature checked,
and the decrypted message will be displayed in the top part of the
display window, with signature information in the bottom part. The
mail header is not displayed, but can be read by pressing the 'Header'
button to display the header window. In addition, the program has
support for encrypted mailing list feeds, and if the decrypted
message includes another standard-format message it will replace
the original message and be fed back into the display processing
chain.

When composing a message or replying to one, the compose window has
several check-boxes, including one for signature, and one for
encryption. If these are selected, then the message will be automatically
encrypted and/or signed (requesting your passphrase when neccesary) before
it is sent.

Being an Beta release, there are a number of bugs and nonfeatures :

Known Bugs :

	Message list scrollbar often set to stupid position when loading
	a mail file.

	When you save changes to the mail file, it throws away the
	signature verification and decrypted messages, so that the
	next time you view a message it has to be verified or decrypted
	again.

	'New mail' indicator in icon does not go away if you open the
	window and close it again without reading any messages.

Known Nonfeatures :

	Currently if you send encrypted mail to multiple recipients, all must
	have valid encrpytion keys otherwise you will have to send the
	message decrypted. Also, the message will be sent encrypted to all
	users, not just the one who is receiving each copy.

	'Add Key' button is enabled and disabled as appropriate, but does
	not do anything ! A number of other buttons and menu items do
	not work either.

	Passphrase is stored in ASCII rather than MD5 form, making it
	easier for hackers to find if you're on a multi-user machine (of 
	course, you shouldn't be, but many of us are).

	Kill-by-subject does not work.

	Ignores Reply-To: lines, and could probably do with an improved
	mail-reading algorithm.

	Only one display window, and only one compose window.

	Message List window code needs rewrite.

	Code should be more modular to assist with ports to Xt, Motif, Mac,
	Windows, etc. 

	Not very well documented !

	Encrypted messages are saved to mail files in encrypted form. There
	is currently no option to save messages in decrypted form.

	No current support for remailers and pseudonyms (this will be added
	for the final release).

	Not very well tested on Solaris 2.x.

Privtool can be compiled to either use PGPTools, or to fork off a copy of
PGP whenever it is needed. There are also a number of different security
level options for the passphrase, varying from 'read it from PGPPASS and
keep it in memory' to 'request it every time and delete it as soon as
possible', via 'request it when neccesary and delete it if it's not used
for a while'.

See the README file for information on compiling the code, and the
user.doc file for user documentation (the little that currently 
exists). You should also ensure that you read the security concerns
section in user.doc before using the program.

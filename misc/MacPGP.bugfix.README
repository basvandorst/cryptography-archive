MacPGP 2.2 Bug Note

MacPGP 2.2 contains a bug affecting only certain Macintosh models running
System 7.  The bug manifests itself when typing a pass phrase into the password
dialog window: there is a very noticeable delay in response to keystrokes and
usually there is a system crash after a few characters are typed.  This problem
seems to occur only on Mac Pluses, SE's and (original) Classics running System
7.  Other machines don't seem to be affected and the problem doesn't appear at
all under System 6.

MacPGP 2.2a is bug fix release to take care of this problem.  It contains NO
additional features.  If you have not experienced this problem running MacPGP
2.2, there is NO reason to upgrade to version 2.2a.  If you have been affected
by this problem, you may find it more convenient to download just the bug fix
patch rather than the entire MacPGP2.2a archive.  The patch is contained in
the file 'MacPGP.bugfix.sit.hqx'.  After unarchiving this file use ResEdit to
replace the 'CODE 0', 'CODE 2', 'CREL 2' and 'DATA 0' resources in the official
release version of MacPGP 2.2 with the ones contained in the bug fix file.  
There is also a revised 'vers' resource, to bump the version number up to 2.2a
(0.9.6).

For the technically inclined: System 7 on the affected machines barfs on Text
Edit records enclosed by 0-width rectangles.

Contrary to rumours, there is only one official release version of MacPGP
2.2, designed to work on both 68000 and 68020+ CPUs.  The program dynamically
determines the CPU type it is running on and uses the appropriate version of
multiple precision arithmetic functions to run optimally on that CPU.

Note that I am not the author of this bug fix.  It was sent to me by one 
of the MacPGP developers.  The originator of the bug fix wishes to remain 
anonymous in order to avoid being harassed by PKP.  I will forward any
questions to him.

I have clearsigned the two hqx files, so that you can be sure your copies 
of the files.  I received PGP and the patches by electronic mail directly from 
the authors, so I am reasonably sure they are unmolested.  I have scanned
for viruses with Central Point Anti-Virus, and tested the patched PGP to 
check that I patched it properly.

The patched MacPGP appears to work correctly and produce the same output 
as the unpatched version.  However, I do not guarantee it in any way; if 
you're paranoid, compile your own version from the source and/or compare
output with the UNIX or DOS versions.

Oh, and none of this is anything to do with Mantis Consultants; Mantis 
doesn't even own a Mac.

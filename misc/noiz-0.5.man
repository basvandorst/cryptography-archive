ANTICOPYRIGHT

	Anticopyright (A) 1995 Henry Strickland <strick@yak.net>
	This package is placed this package in the public domain.

	Because this package is free, there is no warranty 
	for it whatsoever.  Caveat hacker.

	This is alpha-quality software.  It seemed to work for
	me, but it may not do what I say it does.

	The MD5 implementation is by Colin Plumb (1993), 
	and is also in the public domain.


See "noiz.doc" for more information.

Features and fixes to add (or think about adding), in no particular order:

        Implement configuration through command-line options rather than
          rebuilding.  Perhaps writing the driver as a stand-alone
          executable with an uninstall function.

        Write a dual driver for two devices, /dev/random and /dev/urandom
          that work along the lines of random.c implementation for Linux.

        Add an IOCTL or API of some sort.

        Write OS/2, Windows 3.x/95 ports.  Make the driver Windows aware,
          so that it will function somewhat better when Windows is active.

        Add sampling of sound-card input, video-card scan lines, more IRQs,
          and any other interesting sources.

        Get a list of settings for various processors to use for the drift
          sampling, if needed.

        Add sampling of Pentium's internal timestamp counter (RDTSC
          instruction).

        A 286-port of the driver.

             Background Information upon this Meeting
   _________________________________________________________


   In September 1995, the International Chamber of Commerce
   (ICC), the Business and Industry Advisory Commitee (BIAC)
   to the OECD and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
   and Development (OECD) proposed that governments and
   industry discuss encryption developments, issues and
   policies in an open, international forum to be held in
   Spring 1996.

   At the OECD Committee for Information, Computer and
   Communications Policy (ICCP) meeting on 23-25 October 1995,
   following decisions were taken:

   1) Establishment of a Group of Experts on Security, Privacy
      and Intellectual Property Protection in the Global
      Information Infrastructure.

   2) Organisation of an Ad-hoc Meeting of Experts on
      Cryptography Policy.

   3) Participation to a Business-Government Forum on Global
      Cryptography Policy.

   4) The Ad-hoc Meeting of Experts on Cryptography Policy
      will meet on 18-19 December 1995 in Paris.

   5) The Business-Government Forum on Global Cryptography
      Policy should be held back to back with the precedent
      meeting.

   6) The first meeting of the Group of Experts on Security,
      Privacy and Intellectual Property Protection in the
      Global Information Infrastructure will be held on 9
      February 1996 in Canberra.

   Despite the French strikes and protest demonstrations in
   Paris, this meeting was well-attended by both business and
   governments representatives. (see Annex I: Attendance
   List).

                          Opening Session

   Welcome by   Etienne Dreyfous        ICC
                Etienne Gorog           BIAC
                Risaburo Nezu           OECD

               Business Views on Cryptography Policy

   International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) Position: Stefan
   Bernhard, Lagerlof & Leman, Sweden.

   In the transformation of paper-based world to a paperless
   world, digital signatures play an important role. Legal
   aspects of digital documents and digital signatures must be
   addressed by governments. Digital documents and signatures
   should also be considered evidence in a court of law. Any
   certification services should be driven by market forces.
   These services should be accompanied by supporting
   legislation to ensure their legal validity. 


   Eurobit-ITAC-ITI-JEIDA Position: Yves Le Roux, Digital
   Equipment, France.

   Companies represented by the quadripartite group --
   Eurobit-ITAC-ITI-JEIDA-accounts for more than 90% of the
   worlwide IT revenue.Considering a market-driven approach in
   a competitive environment and designing products for
   worldwide market, IT Industry needs an harmonisation of
   National Cryptographic Policy on Export, Re-export, Import
   and Use. This harmonisation must be done in accordance with
   a set of principles. Annex II gives the list of those
   principles.


   Infosec Business Advisory Group (IBAG) Position: Alan
   Stanley, European Security Forum, United Kingdom.

   IBAG is an association of European association representing
   the information security interests of users of information
   systems and services. IBAG perceives a growing demand from
   business for integrity and confidentiality for electronic
   information. It finds the current controls process too
   complex and needs a single international solution. Annex
   III gives the list of proposed principles to be applied in
   order to define this solution. For IBAG, there is an urgent
   need for an agreed solution. Consequently, it proposes to
   hold a further meeting of all players in February-March
   1996 with the following objectives:

   - to agree a set of principles on the use of cryptography
   in business.

   - to establish a process and a time table for implementing
   the principles. 


   International Company Perspective: SHELL International
   B.V.; Nick Mansfield, Shell International, The Netherlands.

   This paper explains why encryption is needed for Shell in
   order to protect their assets against Government
   intelligence gathering, organised crime, civil unrest and
   data privacy legislation obligations. For Shell, the myriad
   and diversity of government controls on export, import and
   usage of cryptography equipment results in a maze. Their
   experience in the use of cryptography concluded that the
   difficulties of making encryption equipment operate
   reliably over diverse telecommunication environments have
   often been much greater than deployment or maintaining
   security. For Shell, a trustworsthy international key
   escrow infrastructure based on X.509 certificates will meet
   fundamental present and future business needs.

   Mr. Mansfield insisted on the liability issue for the Key
   Escrow Agents. In case of unauthorised release of key, the
   Key Escrow Agent has to be financially accountable for the
   consequences of this security breach.


   International Company Perspective: CIBA-GEIGY; Rolph
   Haefelfinger, Ciba-Geigy AG, Switzerland.

   Ciba-Geigy is a Swiss chemical and pharmaceutical company
   operating in 75 countries. As Pharmaceutical firms, its
   information is under numerous constraints from
   Administrations (e.g. U.S. Food and Drug Administration)
   around their availability and integrity. In order to
   respect those constraints and to ensure confidentiality,
   they need a strong trustable non-proprietary encryption
   with a legislation identical in all countries.


   Summary of Business Views: Nanette Di Tosto, Bankers Trust,
   U.S.A.

   Five major themes ran throughout the business
   presentations:

   1) Business needs encryption.

   2) Business recognise the legitimate interest of
      governments.

   3) Business has general encryption requirements and needs.
   
   4) There are specific policy issues and legal requirements
      that must be addressed.

   5) Business and governments must work together to develop
      an internationally-accepted global encryption policy.

   General principles form the foundation of this policy. To
   summarize, these include:

   -  free choice of crypto algorithms.

   -  free choice of key management systems.

   -  free technical and economical choices about modes of
      implementation and operation.

   -  agreement between owners, providers, and users of
      encryption methods on responsibility, accountability,
      and liability for such methods.

   Business decision upon who holds its key will be based on
   at least 3 factors: trust, liability and manageability.
   Business urgently request that governments agree to work
   with business to address the issues presented in the form
   of an internationally accepted global encryption policy .

                 Government Views on Cryptography


   U.S. and OECD/ICCP Views: Mike Nelson, EOP-OSTP, U.S.A.

   U.S. Views:

   The goal is to provide users with global encryption
   solutions they can trust to protect their privacy and
   corporate secrets. The challenge is to find encryption
   solutions that do not unnecessarily hinder the ability of
   law enforcement and intelligence agencies to do their jobs.

   Fundamentals of U.S. Encryption Policy are:

   -  No control on domestic use or import of encryption
      products.

   -  Encryption software with symmetric algorithm and a key-
      length of up to 40 bits can be easily exported.

   -  Other products may be exported depending on strength of
      the crypto-system and end users.

   In 1994, U.S. government created the U.S. Interagency
   Working Group on Encryption and Telecommunications. The
   Administration had published for comments draft criteria
   for Commercial Key Escrow and Key Escrow Agent. Some U.S.
   firms are on verge of commercialisation. Implementation of
   criteria for Commercial Key Escrow anticipated in early
   1996. At the end of this part, Mr. Nelson tries to explain
   what was his policy problem (see Annex IV).


   OECD/ICCP Ad hoc Expert Group on Cryptography Policy Views:

   On 18-19 december 1995, this group met at the OECD. They
   are proposing to the Group of Experts on Security, Privacy
   and Intellectual Property Protection in the Global
   Information Infrastructure to start two actions

   1) make a study upon current Member Countries Encryption
      Policies, market for encryption, key escrow encryption.

   2) develop a cryptographic policy guideline based upon the
      following principles:

      - Provides Security with confidence.
      - Voluntary Use.
      - Market Driven.
      - Open and Non-Discriminatory.
      - International perspective.
      - Recognise National Responsibilities.
      - Technically effective.
      - Legally effective.
      - Permits future enhancement.

   David Herson will flesh the principles before January 1996
   and these proposals will be discussed at the 9 February
   1996 meeting in Canberra.


   Japanese Views: Shigeo Tsujii, Chuou University, Japan.

   In Japan, two Ministry compete on the security in the
   Global Information Society: Ministry of Industry and
   Technology (MITI) and Ministry of Posts and
   Telecommunications (MPT). The MPT has started a 5-year
   research and development program on data communications
   security technology and 6-month study Group on Electronic
   Payment and Electronic Money. Both are under the
   chairmanship of Pr. Shigeo Tsujii from Chuou University.


   U.K. and European Union Views: Nigel Hickson, DTI, United
   Kingdom.

   U.K. View:

   It is important to develop commercial Trusted Third Parties
   offering different services:

      - Certification authority.
      - Time-stamping.
      - Key-escrow Agent.

   Algorithms to be used must be public and impliementable in
   hardware or software. Keys must be retrieved at both ends.
   Export Controls must be lifted. Intercountry agreement
   about the Trusted Third Parties process needs to be signed.

   E.U. Views:

   The European Commission is proposing a new 3-year project
   for establishing an European-wide network of Trusted Third
   Parties following the model of the Commercial Licensed
   Evaluation Facilities. This project will be adopted around
   June 1996 with first trial in 1997. Some preparatory works
   will start beginning 1996.


   Summary of Government views: Deborah Hurley, OECD, France.

   ---------------------------------------------------------

                  Global Cryptography Principles

   What are we doing next?


   David Herson will write the principles from a government
   perspective. This document will be available beginning
   January 1996. Business will check it and comment. Next OECD
   related meeting is in Canberra on 9 February 1996.

   Participants agrees to hold a new meeting in March 1996
   with the following objectives:

   -  to agree a set of principles on the use of cryptography
      in business.

   -  to establish a process and a time table for implementing
      the principles. 

   ICC said they cannot organise a new meeting in a so short
   period. U.S. government representatives offered to organise
   the meeting.

           Annex II -- Eurobit-ITAC-ITI-JEIDA Statement

             Principles of Global Cryptographic Policy


   1. Businesses and individuals must have the right to obtain
      confidentiality in all information they send, receive or
      retain.

   2. Business and individuals must be able to prove the
      source and integrity of information and to establish the
      ownership and timeliness of information.        

   3. In order to comply with data protection laws, business
      must be able to strongly protect personal information
      while in storage or in transit in whatever form it is
      stored or transmitted.

   4. Business must be able to protect their assets and
      therefore must be able to strongly protect sensitive
      information while in storage or in transit in whatever
      form it is stored or transmitted.

   5. Businesses and individuals have the right,
      responsibility and need to determine the level of
      protection needed for specific information, and to
      select adequately strong encryption methods.

   6. The rights and safeguards concerning confidentiality and
      integrity of information should not be applied more
      restrictively to information created and/or communicated
      electronically than currently applies to paper-based
      information.

   7. Actions permitted under the existing legal frameworks
      should be exhausted before creating new laws to address
      issues related to electronic information.

   8. Governments need to be able to protect themselves,
      businesses and citizens against the actions of
      criminals.

   9. Industry recognises that governments need to be able to
      access information, for law enforcement and national
      security purposes. These activities must be carried out
      consistent with applicable national and
      internationational laws and due process requirements.

  10. For the use of  confidentiality, in order to establish
      a proper balance between the duties of national
      authorities and the needs of the industry and individual
      users, it is mandatory that governments define first a
      COMMON statement of the problems that need to be solved
      before attempting to find ANY solution allowing legal
      interceptions. Requirements corresponding to this
      statement have to be developed by Industry and
      Governments working together.

  11. Industry must lead the development of the requirements
      for cryptographic standards, involving governments
      (including regulators and auditors as necessary) and
      individuals as important participants in that process.

  12. The IT industry will lead the development of voluntary,
      consensus, international standards consistent with the
      requirements and which provide for adequately strong
      confidentiality and integrity of information in the
      Global Information Infrastructure.

  13. Any standards developed must include solutions suitable
      for use by mass-market products as well as for internal
      business and private use. They must also allow
      businesses and individuals to conform to national and
      international laws and regulations on personal privacy
      and data protection.

  14. The mechanisms implementing such standards must be
      published and unclassified, so that their effectiveness
      can be open to public scrutiny. 

  15. Any patented mechanisms must be available under fair and
      reasonable conditions on a non-discriminatory basis. 

  16. The standards must include a procedure for verifying
      that products conform. Suppliers may provide a statement
      of self-declaration of conformity to the standard.

  17. Businesses developing or using products conforming to
      such standards must have the right to make technical and
      economic choices about modes of implementation and
      operation, including the choice between implementation
      in hardware, software or firmware, where relevant.

  18. Cryptographic products that conform to the agreed
      standards should not be subject to import controls,
      restrictions on use within the law, or restrictive
      licensing; furthermore, these products should be
      exportable to all countries except those which are
      subject to UN embargo.

  19. All parties involved, including users, providers and
      governments must agree on the liability for encryption
      use.

  20. Governments should agree that certain enterprises are so
      trustworthy that their access to cryptographic products
      and technology should be expanded.

  21. Governments are encouraged to inspire confidence in
      cryptography standards by using standardised mechanisms
      for all purposes other than, perhaps, the most sensitive
      diplomatic and defence purposes.

     Annex III -- INFOSEC Business Advisory Group (IBAG)
                          Statement


               Commercial Use of Cryptography
               ------------------------------

   The INFOSEC Business Advisory Group (IBAG) published a
   statement on the Commercial Use of Cryptography some 2
   years ago. The approach taken in that statement, and the
   business need for the international availability of
   adequately strong cryptography remains true today. However,
   some progress has been made in articulating ways in which
   the legitimate needs of the players can be met.

   Further, Eurobit, ITI and JEIDA presented a document to the
   G7 Meeting in Brussels on February 25/26 1995 that provided
   Industry Recommendations for joint Government/Industry
   activity in 6 areas to ensure successful exploitation of
   the opportunities presented by the Global Information
   Society. One of those 6 areas was that of Privacy and Trust
   in the Global Information Society, and a key element of the
   recommendations in that area was a need to resolve the
   current unsatisfactory, to Industry, situation on the
   availability of cryptographic mechanisms internationally.

   This paper does not repeat the general summary and
   background of these earlier documents. It does take note of
   those Principles being developed by the Quadripartite Group
   -- Eurobit, ITI, JEIDA and ITAC - but focuses on the needs
   of business. IBAG believes that these Principles can form
   the basis of more detailed agreement on the provision
   internationally of cryptographic mechanisms of adequate
   strength for use by business.


                         Principles
                         ----------

   1. Governments, businesses and individuals each have the
      right and responsibility to determine the level of
      protection needed for their specific information, and to
      choose adequately strong encryption methods to achieve
      those levels of protection, including type of algorithm
      used, key length, method of implementation, etc.

   2. At least the same rights and safeguards concerning
      confidentiality and integrity of information shall apply
      to information created and communicated electronically
      as currently applies to paper based information.

   3. Except as qualified below, businesses and individuals
      have the right to seek confidentiality of information
      they send, receive or retain.

   4. Businesses and individuals have the right to ensure that
      information sent, received or retained is not subject to 
      undetected change or modification.

   5. Businesses and individuals have the right to be able,
      where necessary, to prove the source of information, to
      establish the ownership of information and to obtain
      unequivocal confirmation of the receipt of information.

   6. Principle 3 notwithstanding, law-abiding governments
      have the right, in the prevention, investigation and
      prosecution of serious crime, lawfully to intercept and
      lawfully to seize information for evidential purposes
      only, where there is no practical alternative.

   7. Businesses and individuals may lodge keys relating to
      their cryptographic systems, using agreed standard
      mechanisms, with a Trusted Party, where that Trusted
      Party can be an independently accredited body or a
      suitably accredited authority within their own
      organisation. Multinational businesses shall be able to
      hold their own keys in one place within their
      international organisation.

   8. Businesses and individuals shall have right of access to
      such keys on proof of ownership.

   9. Governments and Law Enforcement Agencies should have
      right of access to such keys only under due process of
      law in pursuance of their duties as described in
      Principle 6. It is the responsibility of governments to
      ensure that international law or inter-governmental
      agreements allow such access to keys held outside
      national jurisdiction.

  10. Where Governments and Law Enforcement Agencies do obtain
      keys under such processes, they must only be available
      for a specified, limited timeframe and the process of
      obtaining and using the keys must be auditable.

  11. Where Trusted Third Party agents hold keys on behalf of
      businesses and individuals, they must accept liability
      for any direct or consequential loss or damage resulting
      from misuse or unauthorised disclosure of those keys.

  12. Governments, businesses and individuals must work
      together to define the requirements for standards that
      enable these Principles to be implemented, involving
      other bodies such as regulators and auditors as
      necessary.

  13. The IT industry, in consultation with business and other
      appropriate bodies, should develop voluntary, consensus,
      international standards that take into account the
      requirements established through Principle 12 above.
      These standards must include variants suitable for all
      types of business and private use. They must also allow
      businesses and individuals to conform to national and
      international laws and regulations, including those on
      personal privacy and data protection. These standards
      must include independent procedures for verifying that
      products conform.

  14. These standards, and the mechanisms implementing them,
      must be published and unclassified, so that their
      effectiveness can be open to public scrutiny. Any
      patented mechanisms must be available under fair and
      reasonable conditions on a non-discriminatory basis. 

  15. Businesses developing or using products conforming to
      such standards must have the right to make technical and
      economic choices about modes of implementation and
      operation, including the choice between implementation
      in hardware or software, type of algorithm used, and key
      length.

  16. Governments have a duty to inspire confidence in such
      standards, once available, for all purposes other than
      the most sensitive diplomatic and defence purposes.

  17. Cryptographic products that conform to the agreed
      standards should not be subject to import controls,
      restrictions on use within the law, or restrictive
      licensing; furthermore, these products should be
      exportable to all countries except those which are
      subject to UN embargo.

            Annex IV -- Mike Nelson Policy Problem


   Policy Problem:

   Find an encryption policy that makes everyone happy (or
   equally unhappy).

   Constraints

   1. If strong encryption is widely available overseas, it
      will undermine national security.

   2. If U.S. companies can't market encryption customers can
      trust, they will lose market share and sales.

   3. If strong encryption is widespread, crime and terrorism
      in the U.S. will increase.

   4. Without widespread effective encryption, U.S. companies
      and individuals will continue to be vulnerable to
      espionage, computer crime and loss of privacy.

   5. Any solution the U.S. government endorses is immediately
      suspect.

   6. U.S. government desperately needs effective encryption
      for its own data, for benefit transfer, tax filing, etc.

   7. If we allow strong encryption to spread overseas, it
      will undermine our allies' effort to fight terrorism,
      etc.

   8. No one knows if the encryption they are buying is really
      any good.

   9. No one trusts anyone.

  <H1><a name=intro>Introduction</a></H1>

  Cryptix is a suite of cryptographic classes for Java.
  This distribution is Cryptix
  Source 3.1.0
  made on Sat Jul 31 23:41:02 AST 1999.  Cryptix 3 is on a maintenance track,
  new effort is going into a later generation based on
  the JCE 1.2 format.





<H1><a name="install">Installation</a></H1>

In this installation,
there is a stable/fixed README.html and this release
readme file.  README files are no longer numbered according
to the release number.


<H1><a name=new>New in Release 3.1.0 </a></H1>

<P>
This release - 3.1.0 - is mostly a bug fix release
after an extended period of time.  It may very well be the
last release in the Cryptix 3 line, as the next generation
will substantially change distribution patterns.

<p>
Changes include:
<P>
<UL></LI>
    Java 2 (JDK 1.2) compatibility.  No JCE 1.2 as yet, that will
    be released under a different stream.

  </LI><P><LI>
    SHA-1 incompatibility bug is fixed (hopefully).
    MD5, SHA-1, SHA-0 update() bug should be fixed.

  </LI><P><LI>
    RC4 static variable bug is fixed.

  </LI><P><LI>
    Cryptix 2.2 compatibility with RSA is now added.
    It should not be used except by legacy code, like PGP 2.6 below.

  </LI><P><LI>
    PGP 2.6 (not OpenPGP) has been added.  There is only
    a nominal test that suits distribution.

  </LI><P><LI>
    Testing now is more deterministic, as tests return
    10 on success.  This derives from the JVM's
    viewpoint that an uncaught exception is a successful
    result.  New support classes are also added to the test cycle.

  </LI><P><LI>
    Building:  Old scripts in <tt>util</tt> cleaned up,
    and new scripts added.

  </LI><P><LI>
    There is now an example manifest file
    <tt>util/man/webfunds.man</tt>
    which builds a complete single jar,
    taken from the WebFunds project.
</UL>

<P>
These features were included in the previous release:
<P>
<UL>
  <LI> Tools in <code>cryptix/tools</code>: Scar and UnixCrypt.
  <LI> HMACs for all message digests.
  <LI> Cryptix 2.2 compatibility with message digests, modes, ciphers.
  <LI> <a href=guide/cryptix/Support.html>Supported Algorithms</a>.
  <LI> Bugs fixed: RSA ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, Triple DES compatibility.
</UL>
<P>
 


<H1><a name=not>What's *not* here</a></H1>

<UL> 
  <LI> compatibility with JCE 1.2

  </LI> <P> <LI> ElGamal encryption is incomplete
                 (the tests are disabled), and
                 whilst ElGamal signing is working and has a
                 test, it is not really audited.  You should
                 use DSA in preference, which is faster and
                 more reliable.

  </LI> <P> <LI> IJCE:
      <UL>
        <LI>test devoted to IJCE that can run independant of Cryptix
            (java.security.IJCE_test or some Sun standard name?)
      </UL>

  </LI> <P> <LI> testing:
      <UL>
        <LI>Some of the Test* programs do not correctly exit,
          so failures are not detected.
        <LI>
          <code>util/testjar.sh</code> produces guess-code W95/NT batch
          scripts in <code>auto/testjar.bat</code>.  This is
          reported to work, but is not reliable.
      </UL>


  </LI> <P> <LI> Native libraries are not currently included.

  </LI> <P> <LI> OpenPGP is <b>not</b> here at all

  </LI> <P> <LI> Cryptix has only been compiled and run with
    Sun-sourced compilers and JVMs.

  </LI> <P> <LI> Javadoc is distributed without images.

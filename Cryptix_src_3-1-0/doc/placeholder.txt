<h1>Cryptix - Documentation</h1>
<p>
The <code>javadoc</code> documentation is not included with the main
source release, in order to save on download time, and because it can
be generated automatically from the source.
</p><p>
See <a href="../FAQ.html#d_doc">this section of the Cryptix FAQ</a>
for instructions on how to build the documentation, or where to
download a pre-built copy.

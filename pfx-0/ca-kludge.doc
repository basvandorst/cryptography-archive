Here is how I kludge the netscape-cert-type CA bit. This is messy and should
really be done by req -x509 (which I haven't had time to patch yet). This is
horrible and I wont even admit to writing this :-)

1. Create a CA with CA.sh -newca .
2. Edit ssleay.cnf and change the value nsCertType to 0x04.
3. Create a request with CA.sh -newreq, this should have the CA info entered.
4. Sign the request with CA.sh -signreq. 
5. Use a patched x509 (see above) to check netscape-cert-type.
6. You now have a ca certificate and key with the relevant attributes. Self
   sign the new cert with
 x509 -days 365 -in newcert.pem -signkey newreq.pem -out cacert.pem
7. Overwrite cacert.pem in the CA directory (default ./demoCA) with cacert.pem
   and the CA private key (./demoCA/private/cakey.pem) with newreq.pem
8. Use the "new CA" as normal. Don't forget to reset the cert type in ssleay.cnf
   to 0x80 (for clients) or 0x40 (for servers).

If you now add the cacert.pem to any pfx files you create it should be added as
an untrusted CA on import.

Other fairly essential stuff like basic constraints and key useage cannot be
set at present because they are constructed types and the current extension
packing stuff can't handle them.

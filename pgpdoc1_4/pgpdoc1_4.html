<H1>Installing PGP</H1>
<P>The MSDOS PGP release package comes in a compressed archive file with
a file named in this form: <VAR>PGPxx.ZIP</VAR> (each release version
has a different number for the <I>xx</I> in the filename).  For
example, the release package for version 2.6 is called PGP26.ZIP.  The
archive can be decompressed with the MSDOS shareware decompression
utility <I>PKUNZIP</I>, or the UNIX utility <I>unzip</I>.  When
the PGP release package is decompressed, several files emerge from it.
One such file, called README.DOC, should always be read before
installing PGP.  This file contains late-breaking news on
what's new in this release of PGP, as well as information on what's in
all the other files included in the release.
<P>If you already have an earlier version of PGP, you should rename it
or delete it, to avoid name conflicts with the new PGP.
<P>For full details on how to install PGP, see the separate PGP
Installation Guide, in the file SETUP.DOC included with this release
package.  It fully describes how to set up the PGP directory and your
AUTOEXEC.BAT file and how to use PKUNZIP to install it.  We will just
briefly summarize the installation instructions here, in case you are
too impatient to read the more detailed installation manual right now.
<P>To install PGP on your MSDOS system, you have to copy the compressed
archive PGPxx.ZIP file into a suitable directory on your hard disk
(like C:\PGP), and decompress it with PKUNZIP.  For
best results, you should also modify your AUTOEXEC.BAT file, as
described elsewhere in this manual, but you can do that later, after
you've played with PGP a bit and read more of this manual.  If you
haven't run PGP before, the first step after installation (and reading
this manual) is to make a pair of keys for yourself by running the PGP
key generation command <KBD>pgp -kg</KBD>.  Read the <A HREF="pgpdoc1_14.html#0">"RSA Key
  Generation"</A> section of the manual first.
<P>Installing on UNIX and VAX/VMS is generally similar to installing on
MSDOS, but you may have to compile the source code first.  A UNIX
makefile is provided with the source release for this purpose.

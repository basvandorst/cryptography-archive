INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Notes:

o ACE/Agent for Netscape requires approximately 2 MB of free disk 
  space for all of the installed files.

o The installation script can be run by any user that has write
  permissions to the netscape server root directory.

o To install the product, perform the following steps:

1.  Stop the Netscape Web Server, if it is running.

2.  Untar the ACE/Agent distribution archive:

      tar -xf ACEAgentNS_sol.tar  
               or
      tar -xf ACEAgentNS_hpux.tar 
               or
      tar -xf ACEAgentNS_aix.tar

3.  cd into the newly created securid directory:

      cd securid

4.  Run the installation script:

      ./install.sh

o Before running ACE/Agent for Netscape Servers, be sure to copy 
  the sdconf.rec from the ACE/Server to the var_ace directory and
  add the web server machine as a client to the ACE/Server.  Consult
  your ACE/Server documentation for more information.

LOCATION OF DOCUMENTATION AND HELP FILES 
------------------------------------------------------------------

Online help is installed under the document root specified during 
ACE/Agent installation. In order to read the online help, point 
your browser to http(s)://<yourserver>/aceagent/ or open the file 
<documentroot>/aceagent/index.html.  For security reasons, you will 
not be able to use the administration utility by opening it 
locally.  You must open the administration utility only through the 
web server.  If you need to change any installation parameters 
before running the administration utility, edit the file 
<netscapeserverroot>/plugins/aceagent/aceagent.cfg.

FEATURES NOT DOCUMENTED IN ONLINE HELP

o If a persistent, undocumented error is reported by ACE/Agent for 
  Netscape contact Security Dynamics Customer Support.

NEW FEATURES/CHANGES/PROBLEMS RESOLVED 
-------------------------------------------------------------------
VERSION 1.1

o Support for Netscape 3.x Enterprise Server

o The Administration utility will now automatically insert a leading dot
  in front of the domain name.  This fixes a previous problem where all 
  users were denied access if domain cookies are enabled and the domain
  name had been incorrectly specified without the leading dot.

VERSION 1.0.1

o Support for Communicator 4.01 for administration.

o Resolved problem where exceeding the number of concurrent logins
  locks up the server.

o Better aceagent.cfg syntax checking.

o URLs with spaces are now handled properly.

VERSION 1.0

o This is the initial release of ACE/Agent for Netscape Servers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
UNSUPPORTED FEATURES
-------------------------------------------------------------------
o Microsoft Internet Explorer is not a supported browser for 
  ACE/Agent administration.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
KNOWN PROBLEMS
-------------------------------------------------------------------
o If you protect a default page for a particular directory (for 
  example, index.html), users who request the directory will not be 
  challenged. WORKAROUND: Protect the entire directory or do not 
  use default pages.

o If you use the HTTP command POST and post a large amount of data
  (for example, a file), you may experience a browser error such 
  as "A Network error has occurred". This happens only for users who
  have not been authenticated yet, and the POST results in the user 
  being challenged for a PASSCODE. WORKAROUND: User must be 
  authenticated by a GET (for example reloading the form) and the 
  POST must be resubmitted. 

o If you run the administration utility on a UNIX-based browser 
  under CDE (Common Desktop Environment), double clicking on the 
  directory icons do not open or close the directory.  WORKAROUND:
  Use the (+) icons to expand and collapse directories.

o If your server is running with domain cookies disabled and you
  enable domain cookies and restart the server, users who
  had logged in before the change are challenged repeatedly.
  WORKAROUND: All users who are logged in must exit their browsers 
  and re-authenticate.

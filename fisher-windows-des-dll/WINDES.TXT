Abstract:	Data Encryption Standard (DES) - ANSI Standard X3.92-1981

		This generic ANSI-C module employs the DES algorithm to encode
		& decode digital data via 64-bit Electronic Code Book (ECB).

		The DES algorithm uses a 64-bit user-provided private key to
		take a 64-bit data block through 18 data manipulation stages
		for either encryption or decryption.  The first and last stages
		are merely simple bit transpositions - one is the inverse of
		the other (IP & IP'). The middle 16 stages perform identical
		complex bit manipulations that vary according to the data. Each
		bit of the result is a function of each and any bit of both
		the input data and the key; a change in a single key or data
		bit has equal probability of changing any output bit.

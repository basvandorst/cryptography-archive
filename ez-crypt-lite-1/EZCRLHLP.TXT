                              by EZX Publishing


  EZ-Crypt Lite was written by David Black and Perry Kelley.

  EZ-Crypt Lite provides multiple methods for encryption and decryption plus
  tools to help you analyze the encrypted code.  Comments or suggestions for
  improving EZ-Crypt Lite will be appreciated.
     
  EZ-Crypt Lite requires an  IBM PC or compatible with 384K of RAM.  Display
  adapters  known  to work with EZ-Crypt Lite are the  IBM monochrome (MDA),
  color (CGA),  enhanced  graphics (EGA),  and  video  graphics  array (VGA)
  adapters.

  1. No manual screen defined for your selected area.
  2. Couldn't find EZCRLMAN.TXT.  Are both the manual (EZCRLMAN.TXT) and the
     index   (EZCRLMAN.INX)  in   the   subdirectory   specified  under  the
     installation portion of EZ-Crypt?    Use  the installation  portion  of
     EZ-Crypt Lite to set up a new default help/manual path.

  General help for all menus:
  
  This menu is broken up into two basic windows.   The  window  at  the  top
  of  your screen shows several options to choose from.   The window at  the
  bottom  of  the  screen expands on what  will  occur  if  you  choose  the
  highlighted option (the one that has a different background color).
     
  Options may be selected in one of two ways.   You  can  either  press  the
  first letter of the desired command  or  move the highlight bar  over  the
  desired option and press enter.   To move the  highlight  bar  use  either
  the space bar, up arrow, down arrow, left arrow, or right arrow.   You can
  also use home to move to the first top line item on the menu.

  Using the first letter of a command only works in the  ACTIVE  window.  If
  you  don't have any pulldown then the active window  is  the  top  window.
  Once you pulldown one of the options that becomes the active window.   You
  must use one of the commands in the pulldown once it is active.    You can
  always  use Escape to back out of the pulldown and return to the top menu.
#21#

  You  are  now  using  the EZ-Crypt Lite  Main Menu.   From  here  you  can
  access  the main functional  areas  of EZ-Crypt.   Refer  to  the  On-Line
  Manual to get a feel for what a fully featured diskette duplicator can do.

  Please note that an abbreviated directory window will appear in the middle
  of your screen as soon as a valid source diskette has been loaded. It will
  show the diskette volume label (if any) and the first four file names.

  We have tried to design EZ-Crypt to let you get your job done quickly  and
  easily.  Please feel free to forward any suggestions for improvement to us

  This  option  allows  you to  define the default  path for  accessing  the
  on-line manual and context sensitive help.   Make  sure  you  include  the
  index files  (.INX)  along with the help and manual  files  (.TXT) in  the
  specified directory.

#55#

  This option allows you to enable/disable the sound  or  beeps  on  errors.
  Some  people  find  programs  that beep on errors to  be annoying  (me for
  one).   This option  will  allow you  to  disable  ALL  warning  beeps  in
  EZ-Crypt Lite.

#60#
   
  This menu allows you to change all the colors used in  EZ-Crypt Lite.   To
  change a default color - first use the up or down arrow key to select  the
  color, then type in the new color.   When you have changed all the  colors
  press Ctrl+D to display these colors in a  sample  window.   As  with  all
  installation options,  these changes will not be used until you choose the
  retain option on the main menu.   This allows you to experiment  with  the
  installation options  and  then  not have to lose your original  defaults.
   
  Please  keep  in  mind  the  foreground  text  colors  can  be  0-15,  the
  background 0-7. If you choose a text color the same as a background  color
  then the text will disappear.  You may notice some of your installed color
  combinations  result  in  invisible lines  on  the  Ctrl+D  popup  window.
  Please be careful not to choose this color for one of your text colors!!

  Note:  For  many of the EZ-Crypt installable options and  user inputs  you
  will  see a prompt containing the characters  .   If  you  count  the
  number of 's you will find the maximum number of characters that  can  be
  entered.  Also Escape is used throughout EZ-Crypt to signal  "I want out".
  Press Enter, up arrow, down arrow, or whatever is  asked for to enter  the
  desired value.   Escape  will  throw away any  immediate changes  and  get
  you out of the area you are in.
#61#

  Please  note  that  the background color (0-7) is one digit long  and  the
  foreground color (0-15) is two digits long.   That is why you will see the
  input  prompt  (the  s) change it's  width as you go between the  colors.

#65#

  This screen shows the possible combinations of  colors in  EZ-Crypt  Lite.

  If you are using a non IBM display adapter you may have to "play" with the
  colors to get a pleasing combination.   EZ-Crypt  defaults to colors  that
  work  well  with the  IBM Color Graphics Adapter,  IBM  Enhanced  Graphics
  Adapter, and IBM Monochrome Display Adapter.

  On  some  monochrome  display  adapter  clones  you  may  need  to alter a
  foreground text color to get the background to change intensity.

  The default combination of colors will work on any 100% IBM PC  compatible
  display adapter!

  EZ-Crypt Lite  allows the help and manual paths, program colors,  etc.  to
  be saved in a configuration file.   If no configuration file is  specified
  on the command line (ex. C:>EZCRL MyConfg.CNF) when you call  up  EZ-Crypt
  then EZ-Crypt will use the default name of EZCRL.CNF.

  You are being asked for the name of the configuration file to  load.   You
  may have several configuration files saved under different names.

  Example:   BW.CNF (for black and white composite monitors  attached  to  a
  composite color card), etc.

  Please make sure that the  configuration file you are  asking EZ-Crypt  to
  use is really an EZ-Crypt configuration file!

  Remember you can always press ESC if you got into this area by accident.

  EZ-Crypt Lite is looking for a valid file name with an optional drive  and
  directory path.


  Example: C:\EZCRL\FileName.EXT
           ณณณ     ณณ          ณ
           ฦพฦอออออพิออออออออออฯอ The file you want to use

           ิอออออออออออออออออออออ The working drive
           
    

  Refer to your Disk Operating System (DOS) manual for detailed  information
  on paths and file names.

#85#

  EZ-Crypt Lite  couldn't  locate  any  files  in  the  specified directory.

  The computer uses a "mask" for  directories.   The  mask  used  is  "*.*".
  EZ-Crypt Lite automatically adds this mask to the path for you.
#90#

  EZ-Crypt Lite couldn't locate your path.   Are you sure  you  entered  the
  correct path  to get to your file.   Computers are dumb, you have  to tell
  them everything.

  Try  using  the select file option on the main menu.   EZ-Crypt Lite  will
  find  all  the files in your specified directory and allow you  to  use  a
  color bar to select the file.
#95#

  Your floppy or hard disk is used to store files.   Many times,  files will
  be  organized   into  groups  and  stored   in   specific   areas   called
  subdirectories.   The  computer  needs to  be given  a location  called  a
  directory, to find the files.

  The  computer's  first  "guess" on where to find  the files will  be  your
  current default subdirectory (unless you install a default path under  the
  installation section).  Most of the time this will be what you want.

  If in doubt, press enter!   The files are probably located in the  current
  directory which is normally the default.

  A more technical description follows on the next help page.
  
#96#

  This area allows you to specify the path EZ-Crypt Lite will use  to access
  your files.  You can access files anywhere on your system.

  Example: C:\EZCRL
           ณณณ    ณ
           ฦพฦออออพ
           ณ ิอออออออออ The working directory
           ิอออออออออออ The working drive

  EZ-Crypt Lite will ask the  computer to tell it all the files on drive  C:
  in  the  subdirectory  \EZCRL.  The "mask"  used to get the  directory  is
  C:\EZCRL\*.*.   If there are no files in the directory you  specified  you
  may see the error message that says "Could not find C:\EZCRL\*.*".

  If you are not sure what you should use just press enter without  changing
  any of the information.   Chances  are that the default is what  you  want
  (that is why we made it the default).

  Refer to your Disk Operating System (DOS) manual for detailed  information
  on paths and file names.
#100#

  EZ-Crypt Lite will store up to 10 keys within  its  configuration file for
  easy access by you  (or someone else with access to your computer).   This
  feature  makes it  easy  for you to remember keys but should be used  with
  caution.   The keys you specify here can be selected during the encryption
  or decryption process using a menu.   Be careful of who is allowed  access
  to your computer if you use this option.   The  best encryption method  in
  the world won't protect your data if you give away the key!

  What is a key?  It is a special access code used to make a file unreadable
  to anyone who doesn't have the access code.   Just like you can't unlock a
  lock without a key,  you can't look at an encrypted file without the  key.
  You  limit the number of people  who know the key,  thereby  limiting  the
  number of people who can access the intelligence within the  file  even if
  they have access to the file. A key is simply a combination of letters and
  numbers.  They may or may not have any conventional meaning.  For example,
  the letters xyz12345 could be a key.  More keys: never-again, paeirj, etc.

  Keys may consist of letters, numbers, spaces, etc.   Try to come up with a
  key that is unique.   Don't use your name, social security number,  or any
  other item  that someone could easily guess after gathering a few of  your
  personal statistics.
#110#

  The name you are trying to save the new file to already exists.   EZ-Crypt
  is asking if you would like to use the name anyways.  In that case the old
  file will be overwritten by the new file.   You  will  lose  the old  file
  forever.

  If you answer no to  -- OK to erase (Y/N)? --  EZ-Crypt  will allow you to
  enter a new name and will try again using the new name.

#150#

  EZ-Crypt Lite  breaks  up big files into smaller blocks for the encryption
  or decryption process.  This window gives you the status of the operation.
  You will see the block number increase as more of your file is  processed.

  If an error occurs you will be given a message concerning the problem.   A
  couple of the possible errors are:

  1.  EZ-Crypt couldn't find your input file.   Please recheck the filename.
  2.  EZ-Crypt couldn't create your output file.   Is  your  diskette  write
      protected?  Is the disk full?

  After the entire file has been processed (encrypted or decrypted) you will
  be asked  to  press any key to continue.   The  last block processed  will
  normally be only a portion of a block just to finish off the last  portion
  of the file.

  Help for Directory Screen: To edit a file use the up or down arrows on the
  numeric keypad to highlight a file name and then press enter.
     
  All  files  in  the  directory listing are sorted.   EZ-Crypt   Lite   can
  handle a directory containing up to 500 files. If you have more files than
  that in a SINGLE directory then  please  break  the directory into smaller
  ones before running EZ-Crypt Lite.
     
  Cursor key movements:

  Up Arrow - Move up one file.
  Down Arrow - Move down one file.

  PgUp - Move up one page of files.
  PgDn - Move down one page of files.

  Ctrl+Home - Move to the first file in the directory.
  Ctrl+End - Move to the last file in the directory.

  Use Enter to select the highlighted file and start operations using it.
#205#

  EZ-Crypt Lite will sort the directory you are viewing based on the "field"
  you select.  It may be:

  1.  The name of the files.
  2.  The date the files were last modified.
  3.  The size of the files.
  4.  You may also choose the direction of the sort.  Forwards or backwards.


  NOTE:  Do NOT delete files and then use the sort option.   Once you delete
         a file, it's information is removed from the directory listing  and
         you  will  be sorting the  "Deleted"  message  instead of the  real
         information.   This  also applies when you press a key  during  the
         file directory to abbreviate the listing.

#210#

  EZ-Crypt provides a secure delete command called file wipe.   The  file is
  overwritten first with the binary pattern 10101010 then with  the  pattern
  01010101 followed by the default pattern for a freshly formatted diskette.
  This process is repeated three times before the file is  finally  deleted.

  The  military  typically accepts three overwrites of alternating ones  and
  zeros as a secure method of completely erasing a file.   That is  why this
  method was chosen.

  During the wipe process each byte in the file will be overwritten a  total
  of nine times.  This process will be slow for large files and when used on
  a floppy based system.

  IBM ASCII characters range in value from decimal 0 (00 hex) to decimal 255
  (FF hex).  Please note that the numbers displayed on the screen are scaled
  to allow them to fit into a limited space.  The scale is displayed on  the
  window border at the top of the screen and will vary depending on the size
  of the file being used.

  This screen gives you detailed statistics on both  the number  of times  a
  character  occurred  in a file  and  some frequently  used  yardsticks  to
  measure the quality of the character distribution.  Some  definitions  for
  the terms used to describe the data:

  Mode - That value which is repeated most often in a  data set.   When  you
         look at the statistics  you  will see the number of occurrences for
         each value within the file.   The number with the largest value  is
         the mode.

  Median - Middlemost or most central item in a set of numbers.  Half of the
           numbers lie above this point,  and the other half  lie  below it.

#301#

  Mean - Basically the arithmatic average.  Add all the values and divide by
         the number of values.   We commonly refer to this as the average of
         a set of numbers.

  Std Dev - The standard deviation is a measure of how the characters in the
            file deviate from the  central value  of the  distribution  (the
            mean).   This number  characterizes  the  width  or  variability
            around the mean.   If you assume a normal distribution, then 60%
            of the data will fall within one standard deviation of the mean.

#302#
  Listed below are the viewable versions  of the ASCII characters  (at least
  those  that  could be displayed on your screen from within this  program).
  This is an IBM ASCII table numbered in hex.  The vertical axis is in steps
  of 10 hex (16 decimal),  the horizontal axis counts up by 1 from the step.

  This bar graphs  show you  graphically the distribution of the data within
  16 character segments of the ASCII table.  The data is scaled to allow the
  largest value to go all the way to the right side if possible. Like on the
  previous screen, the scale is displayed on the window border at the top of
  the screen.   The number displayed on the bar chart times the scale  shown
  on the window border should be basically the number shown for  the  number
  of occurances within the 16 character segment.

  The  best distribution  for  encrypted data  is for all of the segments to
  have their lines the same length.   Patterns are harder to find with  this
  sort of distribution, making it harder for someone  to  decrypt your files
  without knowing the encryption key.

#320#

  The input and output file names MUST be different.  EZ-Crypt Lite compared
  the source (input) and destination (output) file names and found that they
  are the same.   If you really want to overwrite the  input file  with  its
  encrypted counterpart, encrypt to a temporary name  then from DOS copy the
  the encrypted file over the source file.

#330#

  EZ-Crypt Lite  couldn't write the output file you specified.   Some of the
  possible problems are:

  1.  You ran out of storage space on the specified drive.
  2.  The directory  you  told  EZ-Crypt Lite to store the file in  may  not
      exist.
  3.  The destination drive could have a write protect on it.

#350#

  EZ-Crypt Lite  supports  several  different  methods  for  encrypting  and
  decrypting your data.   They range from the very simple and easy to break,
  to the very complex and difficult to break.   The higher the method number
  the  more  confidence you can place in its ability to protect  your  data.
  Also, the higher the method number the more work  has to done on your data
  and the slower the process.

  Method 1:  Fast and Simple -- This  method   is   a  simple  exclusive  or
             function where your data is exclusive ored with the key once to
             encrypt the data and a second time during decryption to decrypt
             your  data.   This  is a very simple method and would only take
             someone skilled in cryptology a few hours to break it.

  Method 2: Transposition -- This  method  uses a  simple  transposition  or
            switching  of the order of characters.   It  chooses  groups and
            then reverses  the  order  of that small section.   The  process
            continues through the entire file.    Like the exclusive or,  it
            provides very little true protection for your data.   But  it is
            very fast and is useful in some situations.
#351#
  Method 3: Substitution -- Each  character  in  your file  is  replaced  or
            substituted  for  by  another  character.  Your key  is used  to
            generate another key 10 to 1000 times longer which will actually
            be used for the encryption.   The exclusive or and transposition
            directly  use your key  so  they are dependent on how  well  you
            chose the key.   Substitution produces a key based on yours that
            will  "mix"  with  your  data and  almost  completely  hide  any
            characteristics of the data.  When you check the file statistics
            for  the  encrypted  file  you will  see  that  the  numbers  of
            occurances for each character tend to be about the same  thereby
            not leaving any traces of what your source data was.

  Method 4: Both Transposition and Substitution -- Both of these methods are
            combined to provide additional protection for your data.

  Method 5: Proprietary -- This method provides the most protection for your
            data.   To discuss how it processes the data would provide clues
            for someone to follow  when trying  to  access  your  data.   We
            estimate  that it  would take  an expert in cryptology  hundreds
            or thousands of hours  (both human and computer)  to  break  the
            code and access your data for a single file.   The process would
            have to be repeated for each file.   A  very expensive  process!

  This screen  is  the  general setup screen to get the options  needed  for
  encrypting/decrypting a file.   It is composed  of  predefined areas  that
  can't be changed and areas for user input.  Both are defined below.

  Predefined areas:  The default keys A-J are installed under the  main menu
                     installation  area.   To  use  one of these  predefined
                     keys press Ctrl+K then the desired key letter.  It will
                     be  substituted  instead of the displayed  default key.
                     You must be editing the key for Ctrl+K to work.

                     The   available   encrypt/decrypt   methods   are  also
                     displayed.   You can define a default method  under the
                     main menu installation area.

                     The source file has been specified prior to this screen
                     and is also fixed. Press Esc to return with a new file.

  User modifiable:  The  user can modify  the Method,  Key,  and Destination
                    file name.   Use the cursor keypad Up and Down arrows to
                    move  between  options.   Press  the  enter key  on  the
                    destination file name  to signal  that you are ready  to
                    start operations with the displayed options.

  Default  keys  are installed under the  installation section  of  EZ-Crypt
  Lite.  You must install them before they can be used.

  Please remember that the default keys are stored in the configuration file
  called EZCRL.CNF.   Anyone  with access to this file will also have access
  to your default keys.   The best encryption method in the world is useless
  if you give someone the key needed to access your data.

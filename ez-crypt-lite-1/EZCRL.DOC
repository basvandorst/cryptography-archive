        WHAT IS EZ-CRYPT LITE?
        ======================

        EZ-Crypt Lite is a powerful encryption/decryption package that 
        allows you to:

        1. Encrypt a source file using one of several methods,

        2. Decrypt the file using a confidental key,

        3. Obtain file statistics (frequency/distribution, mode, mean, 
        median, and more) to determine how well the file is encrypted 
        (also to look at other encrypted files),

        4. And do it all without cryptic commands!


        EZ-Crypt Lite comes configured to work with most display adapters 
        and monitors.  You can easily customize it to suit your needs.


        HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS
        =====================

        1.  IBM PC/XT/AT, IBM PS/2, or fully compatible computer.

        2.  384K RAM and DOS 3.0 or later.

        3.  Any monitor.  EZ-Crypt Lite has been written to accommodate 
        monochrome, color, enhanced graphics,  and video graphics array 
        adapters.  Some "autoswitch" adapters may need to be in "manual".

        4.  At least one 5.25" floppy disk drive.  Two floppy disk drives 
        or one floppy and a hard disk (300K free space minimum for the 
        full system) are strongly recommended. 





















                                        5








        INSTALLATION
        ============

        Two 5.25" diskettes are normally included with EZ-Crypt Lite. 
        Also, some copies sold thru various distributors may vary in disk 
        quantity and make up, but all the files will be there.

        The diskette with the bright green label contains a Valueware 
        version of EZ-Crypt Lite that has additional information screens,  
        but all features are enabled.  The purpose of this diskette is to 
        check your entire system for proper operation before you break 
        the seal on the full system diskettes. (a.k.a. Diskette #0)

        Diskette #1 (the main disk) contains the actual program, the 
        context sensitive help, the on-line manual and additional support 
        files. Diskette 1 is sealed.


        INSTALLATION FOR the Valueware DISKETTE
        =======================================

        1. Make sure the Disk Operating System (DOS) has been loaded into 
        your system and you are at A>> (system prompt).  If you are 
        confused, consult your computer manual or your local PC "guru" 
        first as we can only help you with EZCRL.  If you need help with 
        DOS, try a local community college, adult continuing education 
        course at a local high school, or a "Puter-Tutor" type training 
        service.

        2. Insert the Valueware diskette into DRIVE A.

        3. Type

        EZCRL

        and press

        RETURN (ENTER on some machines, also, <<cr>> )

        The opening screen of EZ-Crypt Lite will ask you to press any key 
        to continue. Pressing any key will allow you to scroll through 
        various opening screens with important information (these screens 
        may not be included).  When the EZ-Crypt Lite's Main Menu appears 
        on your screen, go to the "GETTING STARTED" section of the manual 
        (this section is just after this installation section). Follow 
        the easy to understand instructions and welcome to the world of 
        EZ-Crypt Lite!

        Some packaging may not contain the "Valueware" diskette, so just 
        ignore this section of the manual if you do not have one. Reasons 
        include site licensing and/or other distributor arrangements.

        P.S. The Valueware version of EZ-Crypt Lite will do everything; 
        however, help may be limited due to space limitations.  Also 
        additional product information screens may be added.


                                        6









        Feel free to share ONLY the Valueware version with friends and 
        potential users of EZ-Crypt Lite for evaluation purposes only. 
        You may not use the Valueware version on other machines in order 
        to avoid purchasing additional copies of the full program.  You 
        may not give away any copies or make more than one copy of the 
        fully operational program for other than archival purposes.  The 
        full version of EZ-Crypt Lite has a unique serial number embedded 
        in each copy for traceability.


        INSTALLATION FOR FLOPPY DRIVE SYSTEMS (NO HARD DRIVE)
        =====================================================

        Please read through the entire installation procedure before 
        proceeding. This may save you some frustration later.

        1. Make sure Disk Operating System (DOS) has been loaded into 
        your system and you are at A:> system prompt.  If you need help, 
        consult your DOS manual or find a local computer "guru" to help 
        you out.

        2. Make a backup copy of the diskettes.  ONLY operate from backup 
        copies!

        3. Insert diskette #1 into DRIVE A.  No additional steps are 
        needed.

        Please sign and mail your registration card to the address on it. 
        Make a copy for your own records.  User support and updates 
        cannot be provided UNTIL your registration form is on file.

        Although EZCRL is not copy protected, you may make copies for 
        archive purposes only.  The purchase of one copy does not 
        authorize you to install EZCRL on more than one machine or on a 
        network.  If you intend to install to a hard drive, but run the 
        program from your floppy drive first, delete the file EZCRL.CNF 
        (if it exists) before loading to your hard drive.


        INSTALLATION FOR HARD DISK SYSTEMS
        ==================================

        1.  Make sure DOS has been loaded into your system and you are at 
        C:>.  (Note: Installation on a hard disk will require a minimum 
        of 300K of free disk space for the full system.)

        2.  Create a subdirectory called "EZCRL".  If you are not 
        familiar with creating a subdirectory, simply type

        MD  C:\EZCRL followed by Return

        If your drive is other than C:, substitute the appropriate 
        letter.



                                        7








        3.  Place diskette #1 (bright red label) into DRIVE A and type

        COPY A:*.*  C:\EZCRL followed by Return

        The program, on-line manual, and other related files on diskette 
        #1 will now be copied to your hard disk.

        8.  At C:> type

        CD \EZCRL followed by Return

        This will put you in the EZCRL subdirectory.

        9. Type

        EZCRL followed by Return.

        Admire the glittering opening screen, press any key to continue, 
        and select one of the menu options on your screen.


        IMPORTANT INSTALLATION NOTES:

        1. Diskette #1 contain many files in addition to EZCRL.EXE. 
        Because EZ-Crypt Lite is a large program, the additional files 
        EZCRLHLP.TXT and EZCRLHLP.INX are required for context sensitive 
        help.  EZCRLMAN.TXT and EZCRLMAN.INX are required for the on-line 
        manual.  So please make sure that these files are in your default 
        directory when running the program.

        If you have only one floppy drive, you can build a work diskette
        containing: EZCRL.EXE, EZCRLHLP.TXT, EZCRLHLP.INX, EZCRLMAN.TXT, 
        and EZCRLMAN.INX.  Do not copy EZCRL.CNF, if it exists. A new 
        EZCRL.CNF will be saved when you select options.

        2. If your EZ-Crypt Lite does not run properly:

        A. Delete the EZCRL.CNF file and try to run again.  Check out our 
        troubleshooting section near the end of this manual.

        B. Your machine may not be totally IBM PC operating system 
        compatible.  This is not always disastrous and a quick call to 
        our phone support staff may solve your problem.

        C. You may have a slightly incompatible "EGA" card with auto 
        switch features.  Usually, turning off autoswitch and forcing the 
        system into the EGA mode solves the problem.

        D. If you have any memory resident programs or system drivers, 
        try running without them loaded in your computer.  On some 
        computers, ANSI.SYS is suspect.  






                                        8








        3. If your monitor appears to be losing certain characters or 
        features, you may have a "color" system with a composite 
        monochrome (green, amber, LCD, etc.) monitor.  Adjust the 
        contrast and brightness of the monitor until the screen is 
        readable.  In some cases, you may have to go to the Install Menu 
        to chose acceptable "colors".  See the "Troubleshooting" section.

        4. This Manual is designed to give you a general overview and 
        familiarity with the program.  More complete, up-to-date 
        information is available to you through the context sensitive 
        help (F1) and the on-line manual.  When using the more advanced 
        features of the program, the help screens will guide you through 
        the toughest questions with ease.  As EZ-Crypt Lite continues to 
        add more features, you can be sure that the on-line manual and 
        context sensitive help will give you the guidance needed.  This 
        way everybody wins.  We don't spend money continually revising 
        manuals and charging you higher prices, and you get what you want 
        and deserve: accurate up-to-date information.  So fire up the 
        computer, dig in, and welcome to EZ-Crypt Lite!

        5. Note to advanced users:  To be able to run EZCRL from any point 
        on your hard disk, create a batch file called EZCRL.BAT and store 
        it in your path.  

        It should contain -->  C:\EZCRL\EZCRL.EXE C:\EZCRL\EZCRL.CNF

        This will enable you to run EZCRL from anywhere on your hard disk 
        with full context sensitive help and on-line manual.  Be sure to 
        install the help/manual path within EZCRL to be C:\EZCRL.

        GETTING STARTED
        ===============

        After you type EZCRL <<cr>> (Enter or Return), the opening screen 
        of EZ-Crypt Lite (EZCRL) will appear.  At the bottom of your EZCRL 
        opening screen you are instructed to press any key to continue. 
        The MAIN MENU will appear on your screen.

        The Main Menu options with descriptions are below.

        On-Line Manual: This is an on-line manual covering features of 
        EZ-Crypt Lite in more depth than the documentation available in 
        this manual. 

        Encrypt: Encode or hide the information within a file to make it 
        unreadable to anyone who doesn't have a special access code 
        called a key.  Just like you can't unlock a lock without a key, 
        you can't look at an encrypted file without the key.  You limit 
        the number of people who know the key, thereby limiting the 
        number of people who can access the intelligence within the file 
        even if they have access to the file.  A key is simply a 
        combination of letters and numbers.  They may or may not have any 
        conventional meaning.  For example, the letters xyz12345 could be 
        a key.

        Please note that we provide several methods of encryption and 
        decryption.  The methods are listed roughly in order of the level 
        of protection they provide for your data.  The more powerful the 
        method, the further down in the methods list it is.  EZ-Crypt 
        doesn't store the encryption method or the key you used to 
        encrypt the file.  If you forget this information for the 
        decryption process you can also forget your file.  This is the 
        nature of data protection.

        Decrypt: Decryption is the opposite of encryption.  You use a key 
        with the encrypted file to reverse the encryption process giving 
        you the file you started with.

        Analysis/Statistics:  Here you can "look" at any file to see how 
        the characters are distributed within the file.  Statistics are 
        provided to allow you to get a feel for the "goodness" of the 
        encryption process.  

        Install: The installation portion of EZ-Crypt Lite allows you to 
        customize the colors, directory defaults, and other options.

        Quit and exit to DOS: All good things must come to an end.  
        Choose this option if you want to leave EZ-Crypt Lite and return 
        to DOS.

        You may choose any of the displayed options by pressing the first 
        letter or by moving the light bar (the giant cursor) with your 
        cursor keys or space bar to the desired option and pressing 
        Return.  Please note that once you have a pulldown active, the 
        first letter selects options within the pulldown NOT the top EZ-


                                       10








        Crypt Lite main menu line.

        (If you have a "color" system with a composite monochrome monitor 
        and don't see a light bar or other features, try adjusting the 
        brightness or contrast of your monitor. You may also need to 
        install special colors for your system. See the Install Menu.)

        Now let's do something simple to demonstrate how EZ-Crypt Lite 
        works.

        Press E (Encrypt)

        Then press enter with the "pick from a menu" option highlighted.  
        Your screen should clear and you will be given a list of files to 
        encrypt.  Press enter with the first file highlighted.  Press 
        enter again on the next menu to accept the default name for the 
        encrypted file.

        You have just encrypted your first file.


        TUTORIAL (encrypting/decrypting a file)
        =======================================

        Now let's encrypt a file while using various options.  Don't 
        worry about being fancy or being intimidated; this first use is 
        only for practice.  We can get fancy later.

        From the Main Menu, highlight the encrypt section and press

        E

        (Encrypt) a file.  

        The encrypt pulldown will appear on the menu with the SelectMenu 
        option highlighted.  Steps are:

        1.  Press enter.  You will now be prompted for where the file is 
        located which is to be encrypted.  You are being asked for the 
        subdirectory name for its storage location. 

        2.  Press enter to accept the default directory.  A directory of 
        files will appear with the first filename highlighted.  

        3.  Press enter to use this file.  You will then see a window 
        listing multiple options for encryption method, key, and output 
        file.  Accept all the defaults by pressing enter.  Note:  
        Pressing enter on the destination filename is the signal that you 
        are done editing the options.

        4.  A file will now be written in encrypted form using the 
        default key (probably Unknown) and the default filename show.  
        The file to be encrypted is broken into small blocks which can be 
        easily handled and then encrypted.  You will see the block number 
        increase as each block is processed.  Press any key to return to 


                                       11








        the main menu after it finishes.

        From the Main Menu, highlight the decrypt section and press

        D 

        (Decrypt) a file.
         
        To decrypt a file you reverse the process for encrypting a file.  
        You first select the file you just encrypted using the same steps 
        as for encryption.  Don't change the encryption method or key!  
        Specify a output file name as appropriate.  It's that simple.

        ADDITIONAL FEATURES
        ===================

        COLOR CONTROL

        For users with color monitors, the color option in the Install 
        menu gives you total color control of text, background, borders, 
        highlighted areas, etc.  Just press C from the install menu.


        Troubleshooting
        ===============

        Displays

        If, after loading EZ-Crypt Lite, you see text and no borders, or 
        nothing at all, you may have a compatibility problem.  EZCRL uses 
        high speed screen updates which may cause a problem with some 
        not-too-close IBM PC operating system compatibles.  For example, 
        the Tandy 2000 and Sanyo 555 series computers are not compatible 
        with EZCRL.

        IBM type monochrome (MDA), color (CGA), EGA (enhanced graphic), 
        and VGA (video graphics array) adapters are known to work with 
        EZ-Crypt Lite.  If you are using a compatible color video card 
        with a green or amber screen, or LCD monitor, you may need to 
        adjust your brightness and contrast, or Install other "colors" 
        from the color installation screen.  Also see the BWVIDEO.DOC 
        file.  BWVIDEO.COM is a "color killer" that works especially well 
        with composite monochrome monitors, and lap top computers with 
        LCD monitors.  Sometimes executing the DOS "MODE BW80" command 
        works.

        Some "autoswitch" Enhanced Graphic Adapters and "Hercules" type 
        mono-graphics cards may need to have their auto modes disabled 
        for proper operation.

        If EZ-Crypt Lite will not run, you may have insufficient memory, 
        or too many memory resident programs.  Try running EZCRL with no 
        memory resident programs.

        If EZ-Crypt Lite just stops running or "freezes", you may have 
        removed the program diskette from the disk drive.  The program 
        disk must be available to access the context sensitive help and 
        on-line manual.  Of course, if EZCRL.EXE and its support files are 
        on your hard drive, this will probably not be a problem.

        Occasionally, certain memory resident, TSR, or "pop-up" programs 
        conflict with EZ-Crypt Lite.  In general, there is no problem, 
        but there are many new programs being written without regard to 
        the system requirements of EZCRL.  Remove them from memory, and 
        try again. If that fails, try getting rid of device drivers in 
        your CONFIG.SYS file.  ANSI.SYS is a prime suspect for some not-
        so-compatibles.

        The latest information on monitors and displays may be put on a 
        distribution diskette (see Disk #1) in a file called 
        MONITORS.DOC.  To print this information on your printer, just 
        make sure the file is in the default directory and type COPY 
        MONITORS.DOC PRN <<cr>>.


        Miscellaneous

        EZ-Crypt Lite works closely with your computer's hardware to 
        gain much of its speed.  However, it never directly addresses 
        the hardware without using standard DOS calls.  If you have any 
        memory resident software that modifies the way DOS works, then 
        EZ-Crypt Lite may not function properly.  We strongly recommend 
        that you remove all memory resident software before running EZCRL!

        Basic Definitions:
        ==================

        The terms used in EZ-Crypt Lite may be a little confusing.  These 
        terms are not made up, they are frequently used when discussing 
        cryptography.  We have tried to pick a handful of the most 
        important terms and define them for you.  They are:

        Cryptography -- The general study of hiding the meaning of 
        messages and the general techniques used for the hiding.
          
        Cryptanalysis -- The solving or breaking of codes without any 
        knowledge of the key.

        Cipher -- Any technique,  method,  or scheme (substitution, 
        transposition, and XOR) used to encrypt and decrypt text,  
        without regard to its linguist structure.

        Plaintext -- The unencrypted or totally decrypted readable text.

        Cyphertext -- The unintelligible text, after encrypting it.

        Encrypting -- The process of encoding a plaintext file to hide 
        the intelligence.

        Decrypting -- Decoding an encrypted/ciphertext file.

        Key -- The text that was used to encrypt or decrypt a file.   
        Sometimes called a code word.  Keys can be simple everyday words 
        or very complex combinations of characters that have no meaning.  
        Some electronic information services pick your password by 
        combining two regular words with a character between them.  
        Examples keys: abc1234, Never:Again, and alsdkfqiaef. 

        Substitution encipherment -- Replaces each letter of the original 
        message by another.

        Transposition encipherment -- Rearranges  the position  of  each 
        letter of the original message, but doesn't change their 
        identities.

        XOR -- Exclusive or, an arithmetic based encryption technique 
        working at the bit level on characters.

        Encrypted Ramblings  - Some Good Information
        ============================================ 

        As networks proliferate the need for data security increases.  
        The world in the past has largely depended on physical security, 
        that is safes and locks.  Computers, much to the bureaucrats 
        consternation, are rapidly eroding the possibility of physical 
        security (wherever a modem is connected to a phone line).  Laws 
        will be passed, but in the final result, honesty depends on good 
        locks and all the ministrations of legislators  and bureaucrats 
        will come have little positive effect on security.  Human nature 
        will win out.  The easier it is to get, the more likely it is to 
        be stolen.  Encryption provides part of the answer to the need 
        for increased security.  It will be especially useful in systems 
        that are open to all users but have some confidential data.  
        Instead of complex levels of users verification through 
        passwords, everyone can get the file but only the people with the 
        key can decode the information.  Encryption at its present state 
        is cumbersome and time consuming but, faster computers and better 
        programs can ease this problem.  This is where EZ-Crypt Lite 
        comes to the rescue.

        Encryption if nothing else is a fascinating exercise.  EZ-Crypt 
        Lite implements a version of Vernham's machine developed at Bell 
        labs in the 20's.  The original machine used Baudot code on the 
        Teletype and performed an exclusive or (XOR) on each character of 
        the message and the key to produce the encrypted character.  The 
        message was decoded by the same machine in the same manner.  The 
        method is considered unbreakable if two conditions are met.  
        First the key is longer than the message and second the key is 
        only used once, sometimes called a "one time pad."  Typically the 
        files you will be encrypting are much longer than the your key
        (also much longer than the one we build from your key) thereby 
        weakening the encryption.  

        Distribution and maintenance of keys is unworkable in the day to 
        day operation of any communications operation of any size.  EZ-
        Crypt Lite builds a much more complex key from your simple key, 
        in an effort to provide a method to ease this problem.  It 
        creates a one time pad based on your unique key.  Most random 
        keys are not truly random since all random functions are 
        repeatable and their true randomness is somewhat suspect.  What 
        is the solution?  Always the specter of a bigger and faster 
        computers loom in the future to provide even faster encryption.  
        Thinkers build on the best thoughts of those preceding them.  
        More powerful computers and better encryption techniques will 
        eventually provide a good solution to this problem. 

        EZ-Crypt Lite provides encryption methods that range from the 
        very simple to the complex.  Combinations of these encryption 
        methods are supported.  This further complicates the process of 
        breaking the code.

        In our implementation two compromises were made.  Potentially 
        the most dangerous compromise is allowing you to store a set of 


                                       16








        default keys in a configuration file.  So be careful about 
        allowing access to this configuration file (called EZCRL.CNF).  
        Another compromise was in using a relatively simple exclusive or 
        method used in the simpler encryption techniques.  Use the higher 
        numbered methods for more protection.

        How do you select a good key?  Several things should be 
        considered.  The key should not have a lot of repeating 
        characters, if they have any pattern to the eye they should not 
        be used.  The keys should be kept secure.

        If there is any question of the randomness of the encrypted file, 
        EZ-Crypt Lite could be used on it multiple times using different 
        keys.  The true randomness of the key should not matter since the 
        use of more than one key should make unraveling very difficult if 
        not impossible.  This process could be repeated until the 
        paranoia of the person generating the keys was satisfied.

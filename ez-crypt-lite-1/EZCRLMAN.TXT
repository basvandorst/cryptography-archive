  Quick startup info:

  EZ-Crypt Lite  allows  you  to  encrypt and decrypt files.   This means it
  allows  you  to limit the distribution  of your important information to a
  restricted group of people.   EZ-Crypt Lite  will  give you the ability to
  make your important information unintelligible  to  those who don't have a
  "need to know".   ONLY  those with the correct decryption  key  can access
  your important data.

  EZ-Crypt Lite provides four methods for privacy of communication.   First,
  the simple or fast operation which is basically an exclusive or. Second, a
  form of substitution.   Third, a form of transposition.   Fourth, a slower
  combination of substitution and transposition. EZ-Crypt Lite also performs
  analysis on your data which can be used to check your encrypted output.

  Some people  are  interested  in  determining  what a message said.  Those
  people can use the analysis capability to determine what form of cypher as
  well as try to break the key of an encrypted message. Efforts at reading a
  secret message is called cryptanalysis.

  Refer to other sections of the On-Line Manual for additional  information.

  1. Does  EZ-Crypt Lite (EZCRL) allow me  to send software  thru  the  mail
     without  worrying about unauthorized people getting access to it?  Yes!
     Both  you  and  the person  you are sending the files to need a copy of
     EZ-Crypt Lite and the common shared key.  Before sending the files thru
     the mail, encrypt them using the highest encryption method in  EZ-Crypt
     Lite (this provides the maximum protection).  At the receiving end they
     will decrypt the file using the same method and the common key.

  2. Can  I  be sure that no one will ever be able to  "read"  my  encrypted
     data?   No!   All  that you can do is make it  extremely difficult  for
     anyone to have access to your data.   Your goal  should  be to make  it
     more costly  for  someone  to gain access to your data than the data is
     worth.   EZ-Crypt's  encryption methods  can be broken  but  it is very
     costly to break the higher encryption methods within EZ-Crypt.  It will
     cost someone hundreds or thousands of  hours of manpower  and  computer
     time to "crack" the  higher  encryption methods that EZ-Crypt provides.

  EZ-Crypt Lite requires an IBM PC or close compatible with at least 384K of
  RAM and DOS 3.0 or later.   A hard disk is not required but is recommended
  when  encrypting/decrypting  large files because of the much  faster  disk
  access.

  EZ-Crypt Lite  provides  several  encryption/decryption methods for you to
  choose  from.   We  are  not  trying  to confuse you  with  extra choices.
  Depending on the type of data you are working with a simple  but very fast
  method may be all you need.   As your need for more  protection  increases
  you can use the slower but safer encryption routines we provide.

#200#
  The use  of  coded messages for secret communications has been  a practice
  throughout history.   Julius Ceasar sent coded messages to his general  to
  ensure the  messages couldn't be read  if  they  fell  into  enemy  hands.
  George  Washington,  during  the  Amercian  Revolution,  passed  important
  information about the British forces in coded form. Today, the US Military
  and  many large corporations  pass important information  in  a  coded  or
  encrypted form.

  The ability to communicate is very important.  But there will be occasions 
  when you may want to limit your information. To limit the number of people
  who can read your important information,  EZ-Crypt Lite  will encrypt  and
  decrypt your files.   You can store or transmit those files to communicate
  and still keep your information unintelligible to others.

  Some individuals may be interested in determining  what your message said.
  If this individual  obtains a copy of  your  encrypted  message,  he  will
  attempt to determine what your message said.   Your message  is considered
  safe as long as it will take too long to unravel the message, for it to be
  useful to the other person.

  Some of the fundamental understanding of basic cryptanalytic endeavor,  is
  taken up in the manual.

  Cryptanalysis -- The solving or breaking of codes without any knowledge of
  the key.

  Key -- The text  that  was used to encrypt or decrypt  a file.   Sometimes
  called a code word.

  Substitution encipherment -- Replaces each letter of the  original message
  by another.

  Transposition encipherment -- Rearranges  the position  of  each letter of

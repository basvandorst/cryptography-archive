Special Requirements: 384K RAM.                                         
                                                                        
If file privacy and security is a priority, EZ-CRYPT LITE is a powerful 
encryption/decryption package that anyone can use.  EZ-CRYPT LITE will  
encrypt a source file using any one of several methods, and only decrypt
the file using a confidential key.  And do it all without cryptic       
commands!                                                               
                                                                        
Ideal for use with electronic information services and almost any type  
of file transfer (both electronic and mail service).  Estensive menus,  
on-line manual, and context sensitive help make it easy to use.  And if 
you want file statistics to determine how well your file is encrypted   
(frequency/distribution, mode, mean, median, and more) they are         
available from within EZ-CRYPT LITE.  There is even a ``file wipe''     
option to completely erase all traces of your file after deletion.

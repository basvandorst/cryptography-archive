changes.txt   Mark Riordan    

The following lists the changes made between successive releases of
RIPEM.  The most recent version is 1.2.

Changes between 1.2beta3 and 1.2:

+++ Added makefile changes for SGI Irix 5.1.1.  (Dave Kristol)

+++ Changed output stream to an informative message in certutil.c
(Jeff Thompson).

+++ Updated ripem.el EMACS code.  (Jeff Thompson)

+++ Made minor revisions to ripemusr.doc, ripemfmt.doc, and
ripem.man.  Added change12.txt describing changes since version
1.1.  Added pemdirec.txt, describing PEM-style direct trust.
(Jeff Thompson) 
 
Changes between 1.2beta2 and 1.2beta3:

+++ Made minor changes to certificate code.  (Jeff Thompson)

+++ Revised RIPEM User's Guide to reflect 1.2 changes.  (Jeff Thompson)

+++ Revised RIPEM man page to reflect 1.2 changes.  

Changes between 1.1 and 1.2beta2:

*** Note:  All of the changes between 1.1 and 1.2beta2 marked by "*"
were done by Jeff Thompson of RSA Data Security.

* Added -H option or RIPEM_HOME_DIR environment variable to specify
the RIPEM home directory where all the user's "local" data is kept
such as private key and certificates created by the user.  The public
and private keys files in the RIPEM home dir are searched before
files given by -p and -s.  (Jeff Thompson)

* Generate (-g) also writes a self-signed certificate to the output
public key file (-P or pubkeys in the RIPEM home dir).  The
distinguished name has the Persona format with the RIPEM user name as
the common name.  This displays the users distinguished name and
certificate digest (useful for reading over the phone to other users
who are doing a validation.)  (Jeff Thompson; below changes also by
him.)

* Change password will append a self-signed certificate to the public
key output file (-P or pubkeys in the RIPEM home dir) if it doesn't
already exist in the public key files specified by -p (or pubkeys in
the RIPEM home dir).  This is useful for upgrading to RIPEM 1.2: a
user only has to change their password to create a self-signed cert.
Example: ripem -c -H <my home dir> -s <old private key file> -p <old
public key file> -u <username>.  Note that the private key output
file is implicitly in the RIPEM home dir which has the effect of
"transferring" the private key from the -s file to the home dir -
very useful for ugrading to 1.2.  After this, -s should never be
necessary.

* Messages prepared by RIPEM include the self-signed certificate in
an Originator-Certificate field.  This allows other RIPEM users to
directly validate the sender's public key.  Also, any MIC-ONLY or
MIC-CLEAR message is "Persona ready" for sending to
persona-request@rsa.com to get certified under the Persona CA.

* When receiving a message and the sender is not recognized, RIPEM
can validate the sender's public key if the message has a self-signed
certificate and -v is used.  RIPEM creates a validation certificate
for the sender valid for the number of months given by -v, and
appends it to the public key file given by -P (or pubkeys in the
RIPEM home dir).

* When preparing an encrypted message, write the full names and
validation status of the recipients to the debug file.  This is a
security measure that forces the user to make sure that the message
is being encypted for the right people.

* On receiving a message, write sender info to the debug file to give the
sender username or distinguished name and to give the key status,
such as "key found but not validated" for RIPEM 1.x keys or "status
VALID" for validated keys.

* Added -v option to give the number of valid months of self-signed
certificates (during key generation and change password) and new
validation certificates created when receiving.  For key generation
and change password, -v is optional and defaults to 24 months.

* Accept Proc-Type verison 4 as well as 2001, for compatibility with
future RIPEMs which will have full PEM compliance.

* Added -K option which is the new password when changing the password.

* (Bug fix) When changing the password (-c), do not use -k or
RIPEM_KEY_TO_PRIVATE_KEY as the new password.

* Allow the output private key file (-S or privkey in the RIPEM home
dir) to be the same as the input private key file when changing the
password, so the private key file can change "in place".

* When changing passwords, always display the user's distinguished name
and certificate digest if possible.  This way, a user can
find their certificate digest just by changing their password.

* The RIPEM user's public key is now derived from the
password-protected private key, which is more secure than looking it
up in the public key file.  (Jeff Thompson)

* Use file randomin in the RIPEM home dir if -F is not given on the
command line.  The random input file is now checked for in this
order: -F in RIPEM_ARGS, -F on the command line, randomin in the RIPEM
home dir, and finally RIPEM_RANDOM_FILE environment variable.

* Modified util/ripem.el as follows:
Added ripem-change-password and ripem-validate-and-receive.
Removed generated-public-key-file since this is now in ripem-home-dir.
Now, ripem-secret-key-file is used only during change password.
Always prompt for password when preparing or receiving.
Added ripem-home-dir which defaults to ~/.ripemhome . Create it if it
  doesn't exist.
Modified ripem-list-users to include pubkeys in ripem-home-dir.
Change ripem-process-region to allow displaying output in another
  window.  This is used during receive so that the original encrypted
  message is not erased.   (Jeff Thompson)

+++ Changed the debug level of some messages so that -D 1 gives
you only messages regarding the key status of recipients and senders.
To get the output you used to get from -D 1, you now need to use
-D 2.

+++ Made minor lint-type changes to getsys.c and keyman.c.

+++ Changed RIPEM termination to exit with errorcode 1 if RIPEM
needs to use the message's copy of the public key of the sender 
to decrypt a message.  (Christopher Wren)

+++ Changed a conditional compilation line in bemparse.c to use
__STDC__ instead of __GNUC__ for HP.  (Mark Henderson)

+++ Added -Umips to makefile for SGI entry.  (Mark Henderson)

+++ Made minor bugfixes & enhancements to Perl utilities send-ripem
and display-ripem.  (Greg Onufer)

+++ Updated ripem-faq and ripem-attacks documents.  (Marc VanHeyningen)

+++ Added EMACS interface to RIPEM and PGP, mailcrypt.el.  (Jin S. Choi)

Changes between 1.0.7 and 1.1:

+++ Enhanced RSAREF to include DES-EDE-CBC as an encryption
algorithm.  This is currently double-key DES: encrypt with key1,
decrypt with key2, encrypt with key1.  This new encryption mode
is specified by including the value 1 in bits 15-8 of the
"algorithm" parameter to RSAREF functions.  (Mark Henderson)

+++ Implemented triple-DES in RIPEM.  Added the -A option which
can take values des-cdc and des-ede-cbc.  (Mark Henderson)

+++ Added processor detection and 386 assembly code to double the
speed of the generic MS-DOS version when running on 386 or higher CPU's.
(The 386-specific version is faster, but does not run in the DOS
box of MS Windows, nor with EMM386.)

+++ Updated the RIPEM User's Guide to include a discussion of
the -A option and the previously-implemented ability to have 
multiple public key files.

+++ Included modifications to RSAREF to use the faster GMP
(GNU Multiple Precision) library.  This is not integrated into
RSAREF because of possible conflicts with GMP's GNU license.
See rsaref/test/gmp-hooks-for-rsaref.tar.Z.  (Mark Henderson)

+++ Made static the variable "entry" in GetUserRecordFromServer.
(Rob Spellman)

+++ Made minor revisions to again support the Macintosh Command
Line Interface version.  (Richard Outerbridge)

+++ Ported to MIPS RISC/os.  (Rob Spellman)

+++ Removed the now unnecessary main/ddes.c and ddes.h.
(Suggested by Uri Blumenthal)

+++ Ported RIPEM to Turbo C++ 2.0.  Changed adduser.c, getsys.c,
list.c, and ripemmai.c, and added project files.  (Edgar W. Swank)

+++ Added "version.h" and modified util/man2code to use it.

+++ Modified rsaref makefile to work with AIX/ESA and AIX/386.
(Uri Blumenthal)

+++ Modified RSAREF's rdemo.c to work with additional parameter
selecting mode on certain RSAREF calls.  (Uri Blumenthal)

+++ Added incomplete documentation file ripemfmt.doc, to describe
RIPEM file formats.

+++ Modified server/rkeyserv.c to run under NeXTStep 3.0.
(Louie Mamakos)

+++ Added "repnoh" utility to aid in replying to mail messages
from mailers that include headers in replies.

+++ Changed "generic" entry in rsaref makefile to not include
USE_BIGNUM, which causes problems on SGI machines.  (chk@alias.com)

+++ Changed a #if in bemparse.c to satisfy HP's cc compiler.
(Richard Johnson)

+++ Sped up Perl scripts util/send-ripem and util/display-ripem
by increasing buffer size in subroutine "clobber".  (Louie Mamakos)

+++ Fixed digitas.c and ripemnt.mak to work properly uder Windows NT.

+++ Put NN_2ModExp into RSAREF's nn-386.s, fixing an oversight in 1.0.7.

+++ Ensure that the minimum keysize when generating keys is 512 bits.

+++ Fixed adduser.c so that NRecip, the number of recipients, is
correctly updated.  (This affects only a debug message.)

+++ Allow multiple public key files, either via multiple -p's on
command line, or multiple filenames in the RIPEM_PUBLIC_KEY_FILE
environment variable.  (Suggested by Ron Rivest)

+++ Added RIPEM Beginner's Guide (ripembeg.*) and RIPEM Internet Key 
Server Guide (ripemsrv.*).  (Gary Ratterree)

+++ Added makefile entry for AUX with gcc 2.3.3.  (Phillip Porch)

+++ Removed extra "extern" declaration of usage_msg.  
(Discovered by Tyler Yip)

Changes between 1.0.6 and 1.0.7:

+++ Fixed a bug in ripemmai.c that could cause a key to be written
to a bad filename when writing a key to PubKeyOutFileName upon
decrypting.

+++ Fixed a debug message "X bytes in encoded & encrypted message key:",
which could print a null pointer (in ripemmai.c).

+++ Added display of version number in debug output.

+++ Changed a call to prencode in rdwrmsg.c to zero-fill the input
buffer.  Not strictly necessary, but not doing so caused RIPEM to
printably encode buffers differently (for the last nibble in a line)
for different platforms, causing alarm amoungst RIPEM users.

+++ Added code to getsys.c to record keystroke timings for pseudo-random
data on Unix systems.  (Mark Henderson)

+++ Added DOGETRUSAGE #ifdefs to Linux version.  (Mark Henderson)

+++ Moved frequently-optimized code in RSAREF's nn.c to digitas.c

+++ Ported to Windows NT (Intel 386), including adding some
386 in-line assember in rsaref/source/digitas.c

+++ Added GCC-compatible version of Intel assembler code in
digitas.c  (Mark Henderson)

+++ Split off NN_AddDigitMult and NN_SubDigitMult from RSAREF
into a separate file, digitas.c , since these are the routines that are most
frequently optimized.  

+++ Modified GetUserRecordFromServer in ripemsoc.c to zero-terminate
records received from the key server, to guard against key server
errors.

+++ Added "unsigned long long" versions of code in digitas.c to speed
up RS/6000 version of RSAREF.

+++ Changed RSAREF nn.c and prime.c to speed key generation by
substituting bignum left shifts for bignum multiplies by 2.
(Mark Henderson)

+++ Fixed a bug in the finger client in ripemsoc by always
clearing all file descriptor sets.

+++ Removed the debug print of user's key-to-private key in keyman.c,
as it is more of a security risk than it's worth.

+++ Made changes to makefiles to support Sun's acc compiler.
(Robert Howard)

+++ Added encryption test to makefile.

+++ Made minor changes to bemparse and util/tstbem to get tstbem
working again.

+++ Made minor typecast changes to getsys.c to satisfy system
function prototypes for memcpy.  (Suggested by Robert Howard)

+++ Added Makefile support for NeXTStep 486.

+++ Changed RIPEM's built-in Finger implementation again, this time
to use "/W user" to comply with RFC 1288.  (Suggested by Jurgen Bolz)


+++ Added "util/ripem-encrypt-elm" to facilitate encryption when
using recent versions of Elm.  See script for details.  (Jon Zeeff)

+++ Added new version of "util/ripem-encrypt" script.  (Brent Chivers)

Changes between 1.0.5 and 1.0.6:

+++ Added "umask" to util/ripem-encrypt.  (Jon Zeeff)

+++ Changed mac68k/RSAREF/rsaref.h to include Ray Lau's enhancements
to the RSAREF API.  (Richard Outerbridge)

+++ Added function "ripem-sign-clear" to ripem.el EMACS function.
(Uri Blumenthal)

+++ Made changes to allow RIPEM to compile on IBM's AIX/ESA (mainframe)
and AIX/386.  (Uri Blumenthal)

+++ Modified keyman.c to allow lines starting with "---" to delimit
public keys (in addition to blank lines).  (Inspired by Darrell Long)

Changes between 1.0.4 and 1.0.5:

+++ Modified RSAREF's r_enhanc.c and rsaref.h to support Initialize,
Process, and End modes so that it is not necessary to store an entire
message in memory at once.  (Raymond Lau)

+++ Altered ripemmai.c and strutil.c to correspond to Ray Lau's 
RSAREF API changes above.  However, RIPEM (Unix and DOS) still 
requires the entire message to be in memory for processing.  

+++ Changed RIPEM's Finger implementation to explicitly use the 
"long form" (-l) to ensure that the .plan file will be obtained
from all server implementations.  (Greg Onufer)

+++ Refixed a bug in which an extra blank lines got inserted at
the beginning of the body of the message when -h i was not in effect.
(Greg Onufer)

+++ Changed crackhed.c to allow a value to continue from the 
first line of a multi-line header to subsequent lines.  This 
affords greater adherance to PEM RFC's.  (Suggested by Ray Lau.)

+++ Changed ripemsoc.c to keep trying all key servers even when
one explicitly reports that it does not have a given key.  This
allows a situation in which not all key servers have the same database.
(Suggested by Bill Owens)

+++ Changed crekeydb.c (utility in server/) to properly exit if it can't
open the input file.  (Greg Onufer)

Changes between 1.0.3 and 1.0.4:

+++ Modified RIPEM's MIC-CLEAR mode to quote leading "-"'s correctly.
(Changes to ripemmai.c and rdwrmsg.c.)  (Raymond Lau)

+++ Provided a new, faster MC68020 version of nn.c for the Macintosh,
Think C.  (See mac68K directory.)  (Richard Outerbridge)

+++ Provided a new, faster MC68020 version of RSAREF's r_stdlib
for the Macintosh, Think C (see mac68K directory).  (Richard Outerbridge)

+++ Added makefile entry to RSAREF for Linux.  (Mark C. Henderson)

+++ Added moderate RSAREF speedup for IBM RS/6000 (files nn.c and
digit.c).  (Mark C. Henderson)

+++ Enhanced the UDP-based key server, rkeyserv, to fork and detach 
itself automatically.  (David C Lawrence)

+++ Enhanced the update-key-database script (used only by key servers).
(David C Lawrence)

+++ Updated ripem-attacks and ripem-faq.  (Marc VanHeyningen)

+++ Modified display-ripem (v. 1.0) and send-ripem (v. 1.0) utilities,
and provided encrypt-ripem (v. 1.0).  These are Perl scripts that
work with RIPEM.  (Marc VanHeyningen)

+++ Added utility encrypt-ripem, superior version of the
shell script ripem-encrypt, but this one's in Perl.  (Marc VanHeyningen)

+++ Fixed the ripem-encrypt utility to not overwrite the input 
if RIPEM fails (due to mistyped password, etc.)  (Michael Palmer)

+++ Fixed a bug in ripem.el (EMACS code) in ripem-list-users.
(Jeff Thompson)

+++ Made several improvements to the utility quote.  (V. Bontchev)

Changes between 1.0.2 and 1.0.3:

+++ Enhanced the ripem.el EMACS functions to be more configurable,
and so on.  (Christopher Owens)

+++ Made minor changes to some files in server/ and added the
server scripts run-server and update-key-database.

+++ Documented the "e" option of "-R" in the RIPEM man pages,
previously overlooked.  (Pointed out by Uri Blumenthal)

+++ Modified makefiles to compile under A/UX.  (Phillip Porch)

+++ Added support for Apollo DomainOS sr10.3.5. (Drew Solomon)

Changes between 1.0.1 and 1.0.2:

+++ Took out some unused debugging code that was causing some
compilers to issue warning messages.

Changes between 1.0 and 1.0.1:

+++ Changed keyman.c to call the RSAREF version of DES.  The duplicate
copy of DES, ddes.c, remains in the distribution but is not linked.
Note:  Both ddes and the version of DES that our copy of RSAREF uses
were written by the same person, rwo.  (Richard Outerbridge)

+++ Added support for ESIX, Unix System V R3.2.  (Uri Blumenthal)

+++ Fixed a bug in GetPasswordToPrivKey in which the password wasn't
being zero-terminated when obtained from an environment variable.
(Louis A. Mamakos)

+++ Fixed bug in which an address like fred@computer1.cs.bigu.edu 
was not properly detected as matching the address fred@cs.bigu.edu.

+++ Changed the file permission of ripem.el in the tarred distribution.
(Jeff Thompson)

+++ Fixed a typo in an environment variable in the RIPEM User's Guide.
(MIke Palmer)

Changes between Beta-9 and 1.0:

+++ Eliminated extra blank lines in makefile that confused AIX.
(Uri Blumenthal)

+++ Fixed typo in makefile for SGI.  (Mark Henderson)

+++ Performed more Lint-type code cleanup.  (Greg Onufer)

Changes between Beta-8 and Beta-9:

+++ When deciphering, ensure that the public key of the sender 
as supplied in the message header matches the value retrieved 
from the file/server/finger.  

+++ Added support for IBM AIX/370 and AIX/386, including 
386 assembler code for AIX/386.  (Uri Blumenthal).

+++ Do not use Henderson's BIGNUM code in the DOS version.  Doesn't work;
don't know why.

Changes between Beta-7 and Beta-8:

+++ Added makefile support for Solaris 2.x GCC compiler.
(Greg Onufer)

+++ Added support for Linux 0.98 (no sockets, though).
(Mark C. Henderson)

+++ Improved speed of RSAREF nn.c, all-C version, by incorporating
BIGNUM's integer squaring algorithm.  Speedup of ~15%.  
(Mark C. Henderson)

+++ For the Mac version, get the user name from both the Chooser
and the environment (separated by a comma), rather than just one or
the other.  Increases chances that RIPEM will be able to find a
good email address for user.  (Richard Outerbridge)

+++ Do not attempt to find the user's old public key if we are
generating a public key (-g).

+++ Fixed bug in which decrypting a null signed message caused RIPEM to
claim it couldn't allocate memory.  (Actually, in my opinion the
bug is in malloc.)   (Reported by Jeff Thompson)

+++ Implemented -T recip_opts string to govern certain options related
to recipients.  recip_opt contains one or more of:
a -- means always abort if, while encrypting, we can't find the 
key for a user.
m -- means add me as a recipient when encrypting (only for
"-m encrypted").
n -- clear above conditions.
(Based on a suggestion by Jeff Thompson)

+++ Fixed a bug in which RIPEM thought it had detected an initialization
vector inconsistency if it couldn't find a public key for the first 
recipient but was told to proceed anyway.  

+++ Cleaned up code in "keyman.c" GetPublicKey; do not decode key
unless the key has actually been found.

+++ Added extra "close" of socket in ripemsoc.c's GetUserRecordFromFinger
in attempt to solve problem in which finger fails under complex
circumstances.  (Reported by Marc VanHeyningen)

+++ Revamped code to retrieve keys from flat files, to make it more
similar to process of getting keys from a server or finger.

+++ Added check of MD5 digest of retrieved public key vs. the 
MD5OfPublicKey: field that goes along with the key.  (Requested by
Jeff Thompson and others)

+++ Fixed Beta 7.1 bug by adding code to rewind the public key
file for every user.

Changes between Beta-6 and Beta-7:

+++ Updated Perl routines that interface the MH mailer with RIPEM.
Changed the name of pshow to display-ripem.  (Marc VanHeyningen)

+++ Cleaned up various routines to eliminate compiler warnings.
(Greg Onufer, Mark R.)

+++ Added assembler version of RSAREF nn.c for 680x0-based machines.
52% faster than C version for key generation.

+++ Added assembler version of nn.c for DJGCC 386 DOS-extender version.
62% faster than C-only DJGCC version.

+++ Improved RSAREF makefile to support new assembler code and
to generally support various architectures more cleanly.

Changes between Beta-5 and Beta-6:

+++ Ported RIPEM to DJGCC, Intel 386 DOS-extender version of GNU C 2.2.2.
Provides about 125% speedup over Microsoft C 7.0.  (I can't believe
nobody else had ported RIPEM to a 386 compiler yet.)

+++ Added SPARC assembler version of nn.c, the most time-critical
routine in RSAREF.  36% speedup over C version.  
(Mark Henderson, with help from the French BIGNUM pkg)

+++ Added assembler versions of certain time-critical routines
(desc.c and nn.c) for the Macintosh.  (Richard Outerbridge)

+++ Enhanced MH-oriented Perl scripts pshow and send-ripem.
(Mark VanHeyningen)

+++ Made minor formatting and syntactic changes to RIPEM User's Guide.

+++ Added newline to end of RSAREF's r_keygen.c to prevent annoying 
compiler warnings.  (Greg Onufer)

+++ Added extra parenthesis to an expression in keyman.c in an attempt
to keep Sun's ANSI C compiler from complaining.  (Grep Onufer)

+++ Removed now-unnecessary #ifdef from getoptpr.h.  (Greg Onufer)

Changes between Beta-4 and Beta-5:

+++ Added Perl scripts util/pshow and util/send-ripem to facilitate
reading and sending RIPEM messages with the MH mailer.
(Mark VanHeyningen)

+++ Modified key server utility routine db2flat to be more cautious
about listing which aliases should be correctly associated with
a given key.

+++ Modified HP/UX support to use TERMIOS, fixing an intermittant
problem with interactive prompts on HP's.  (Mark VanHeyningen)

+++ Renamed "getopt" to "mygetopt", to work around conflicts
with function prototypes for the system's version.

+++ Fixed an uninitialized variable "found" in DoChangePW.

+++ Fixed a bug in which RIPEM was eating the first blank line
after the header when encrypting messages with -h i.  (Reported
by Marc VanHeyningen)

+++ Fixed a bug in which RIPEM thought it wasn't getting the
right username from the server if the returned name differed by
leftmost components of the hostname.   Also added more code to
prevent server lookup loops.

+++ Changed wording of debugging message in keyman.c.

+++ Made numerous changes to accomodate Solaris 2.x; also
did some code cleanup (removed stray variables, etc.)
(Greg Onufer)

Changes between Beta-3 and Beta-4:

+++ Replaced rsaref/source/desc.c with an different version
(KHODES), speeding DES encryption by a factor of 20.
(Richard Outerbridge)

+++ Added feature in which specifying a key to private key of "-"
via -k i causes RIPEM to read the real key to private key as the
first line on standard input.  Useful for programs invoking RIPEM.
(Suggested by Greg Onufer)

+++ Added -c option to allow changing of key to private key.

+++ Changed public key lookup algorithm for scanning flat files.
If a given email address cannot file found as a User: in the file,
successively remove leftmost components of the hostname in the 
address until the modified email address is found, or only one
component remains.

+++ Modified key server to perform similar search to above (i.e.,
remove successive leftmost hostname components as necessary to find
an email address in the database).

+++ Expanded the implementation of "-h p" so it also works for
decrypting messages.

+++ Added external utility "quote" to ease responding to mail
messages.

+++ When computing the salt value for the encrypted private
component, include the password to the private component as
a piece of pseudorandom data.  (Suggested by Jeff Thompson)

+++ Fixed bug in which an extra blank line would be included at the
beginning of the message if -h r was selected.  (Greg Onufer)

+++ Fixed Finger implementation to work for the local host when 
the user's email address does not include the hostname.  (Noticed
by Greg Onufer)

+++ Increased maximum password size (key to private key) from
80 to 256 characters.  (Requested by Uri Bloomenthal)

+++ Added a couple of #includes to strutil.c.  (Richard Outerbridge)

+++ Increased ALLOC_INC in rdwrmsg.c to speed the reading of large
messages.

Changes between Beta-2 and Beta-3:

+++ Allowed the -u username (as well as RIPEM_USER_NAME environment
variable) to have multiple values, separated by commas.  This allows
you to decrypt an email message that's addressed to any of your
aliases, for people who use multiple email addresses.  (Inspired by
feedback from Jim Bernatowic.)

+++ Changed username processing so that if RIPEM_USER_NAME has
a value, it is taken literally as the email address of the user
(rather than having the hostname appended).  (Requested by Jim Bernatowicz.)

+++ Added ability to query multiple key servers, in case one key
server is unreachable.  The servers are specified as multiple 
values to -y or RIPEM_SERVER_NAME, separated by commas.

+++ Reported recent changes to Macintosh and added ability to get
defaults from string resources.  (Richard Outerbridge)

+++ Modified r_encode.c to speed up RFC 1113 printable encoding.
(Richard Outerbridge)

+++ Added option to take pseudo-random data from plaintext message 
when encrypting.  (-R m)

+++ Zeroed out passwords and RandomStruct after use, to increase 
operational security.

+++ Fixed minor bug in getsys.c in which GetPasswordFromUser
would truncate a password if the user typed a too-short password
the first time.  (Mark Henderson)

+++ Added support for Sun's old bundled non-ANSI CC compiler. (Based
on feedback from Jeff Thompson.)

+++ Added support for SGI Irix 4.x.  (Mark Henderson)

+++ Added a few lines to pubinfop.h prototypes file.  (Richard Outerbridge)

Changes between Beta-1 and Beta-2:

+++ Added support for SCO ODT 2.0 Unix.  (Mark C. Henderson)

+++ Added support for Solaris 2.0 (in Berkeley compatibility mode).
(William Dorsey)

+++ Fixed a last-minute bug introduced in Beta-1 in which MIC-ONLY
and MIC-CLEAR messages would fail to decrypt, complaining that
"You are not listed as a recipient".

Changes between Alpha-2 and Beta-1:

Code changes:

+++ Added minor changes to get RIPEM to compile under CMU Mach on an 
IBM RT.  (Marc Ringuette.)

+++ Fixed GetUserInput so that echoing is properly restored to its
previous state upon exit.

+++ Fixed test in ripemmai.c parameter CrackCmd which could result in
bogus message "Must specify at least one source of public keys.".
 
+++ Added #include "adduserp.h" to adduser.c

+++ Added -h options to choose whether to encipher message headers,
and to prepend the (plaintext) headers to the enciphered message.

+++ In GetUserRecordFromFinger() in ripemsoc.c, made several changes
so that not defining USE_SOCKETS would work correctly.

+++ Changed key registry program so it translates all 
addresses to lower case, as well as change the server so it
translates all requests to lower case.

+++ Enhanced key registry program to accept Remove and Change
key requests.

+++ Wrote an email server that will return a copy of the public key
database upon request.

+++ In DoRandom in ripemmai.c, initialized nbytes to RANBUFSIZE.

+++ Fixed encryption mode so that a recipient is not demanded in MIC-CLEAR
and MIC-ONLY modes.

+++ Fixed code which obtains keys from a finger server; sometimes, it
garbled the name of the host and hence was unable to contact the host.

+++ Made minor changes to the Macintosh version of GetUserInput()
in getsys.c (Richard Outerbridge).

+++ Implemented (in ripem client) a REDIRECT key server option, so that 
one key server can pass on key requests to another.

+++ Added checks in ripem to ensure that responses to key requests
really contained the key of the correct user.

+++ Fixed a problem in which during decryption RIPEM did not recognize 
that the user was not specified as a recipient of the message.
A misleading error message resulted.

Documentation changes:

+++ Wrote a real user's guide.

+++ On man page, changed discussion of -g to refer to -S and -P.

+++ Mentioned -Y g in online help blurb.

+++ Documented better the use of key in message header as last resort
when decrypting.  Mentioned that the -P file is appended to in -d -P mode.

+++ Discussed the three encryption modes better.

+++ Mentioned message size limits due to RSAREF implementation (msg
must be kept in memory).


Changes between Alpha-1 and Alpha-2:

=== Code Changes ===

+++ Stopped asking for key to private key when decrypting MIC-xxx types.

+++ "ntimebytes" was not being initialized in DoRandom in ripemmai.c.
Fixed it.

+++ Large private keys weren't being parsed correctly.  Fixed.

+++ Made necessary #include changes to support Mac Think C command line
interface.

+++ Dropped the MD5DigestOfPrivateKey field from the private key file.

+++ "userstream" shouldn't be declared extern in getsys.c.  Fixed.

+++ Added #include of missing prototype headers to getopt.c, hexbin.c,
keyman.c, parsit.c, pubinfo.c, rdwrmsg.c, usage.c.  

+++ Email header processing: "To: address (Name)" was parsed as Name
instead of address.  Fixed.

+++ Ported RIPEM to Macintosh Think C 5.x  (Done by Richard Outerbridge).

+++ Added support for Motorola Delta 88000-based Unix System V/88 machines.
(Done by John Tamplin).

+++ Changed the password prompt to make it more clear that we are asking
for a password to the private key.

+++ Implemented an additional key server option (a third, "g" option for -Y)
which makes ripem do a finger to the user's machine an examine the
results for a public key.  The user would put the public key in
her .plan file.

+++ Fixed server/makefile.

+++ Added domainname to email address.

+++ Slightly modified RSAREF makefile.

+++ Checked more carefully for invalid public keys.  Previously they were not
caught at the right place; the result was a misleading error message.  

+++ Wrote server/db2flat.c, which makes a flat file from the random
public key database.  Useful for creating an ASCII file that can be
distributed via anonymous FTP or email.

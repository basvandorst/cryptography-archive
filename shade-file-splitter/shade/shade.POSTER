`shade' is a file splitting and merging utility.  It takes a large
file and splits it into uniformly sized blocks.  It can also output
extra blocks (called shadows).  These shadows can be used to recover
missing sections if they get corrupted or it they are lost.  With a
single shadow, `shade' can recover ANY single missing block.  As many
shadows are needed as there are blocks missing.  If too few blocks
and shadows are available, nothing can be recovered.

For example, foo.bar (259042 bytes) is split into 5 sections
of 45000 bytes, 1 section of 34042 bytes and 2 shadows of
45000 bytes.  Each of these 8 parts is sent through email.
Even if any two of these eight parts gets lost, the original
foo.bar can be reconstructed.

`shade' is a simple application of the chinese remainder theorem
for polynomials with coeficients modulo two.  For more information
see the comments at the beginning of project.c.



SAMPLE USAGE

Split "bar" (111042 bytes) into 20000 byte chunks and output 2
shadows.  All these parts will be uuencoded and output to
foo.uu.001, foo.uu.002, etc.

    % shade -u -k 2 -l 20000 -o foo bar
    [001] [002] [003] [004] [005] [006] [aaa] [aab] Done.

Merge these parts back together:

    % rm foo.uu.003 foo.uu.005
    % cat foo.uu.* | shade -m -u
    Merging bar (111042 bytes)
    Got section 4 (20000 bytes)
    Got section 1 (20000 bytes)
    Got section 2 (20000 bytes)
    Got section 6 (11042 bytes)
    Got shadow 1 (20000 bytes)
    Got shadow 2 (20000 bytes)

    Missing: [003] [005]

    Recovering 2 sections:
    [001] [002] [aaa] [004] [aab] [006]

Subject: Exhibition of code-breaking machines open at Bletchley Park
Organization: Praxis, Bath, U.K.
Date: Mon, 18 Apr 1994 21:49:51 GMT

An Exhibition of wartime code-breaking memorabilia including fragments
of a Colossus, a wartime semi-fixed-program vacuum tube calculator, is
now open at Bletchley Park alternate weekends.  Bletchley Park, England,
is a country house and grounds some 50 miles north of London where
highly secret work deciphering intercepted German military radio
messages was carried out during World War 2.  Thousands of people were
working there at the end of the war, including a number of early
computer pioneers such as Alan Turing.  The nature and scale of the
work has only emerged very recently, with total secrecy having been
observed by all the people involved.  Throughout the war, Bletchley
Park produced highly important strategic and tactical intelligence used
by the Allies, (Churchill's "golden eggs"), and it has been claimed
that the war in Europe was probably shortened by two years as a result.

The announcement of the exhibition is:

"Good progress is being made by the Bletchley Park Trust in acquiring
the Park as an historical campus, with plans to create very active
museums, initially of Computing and of Cryptography.

The Computer Conservation Society (CCS), a specialist group of the
British Computer Society, has been asked to help the planning and
preparation of a Historical Computer Exhibition there in the near
future.  There are very many buildings in the Park, and there should be
plenty of room for spacious displays. If the plans for acquisition
proceed as expected, it is hoped that the CCS will have substantial
facilities for storage of old artifacts and for restoration workshops,
as well as archive, library and research facilities.

There is already a good Exhibition of wartime code-breaking memorabilia
in an Assembly Hall in the Park. The Exhibition has on show an unique
collection of German cipher machines including a four-rotor naval
Enigma machine, a Lorenz SZ42 and a Siemens T52, all very rarely seen
before. Also on display are some original fragments of a Colossus, and
some of the plans for the Colossus rebuild project. There is a working
radio intercept station with a pair of National HRO receivers.

Much of Bletchley Park, including the Exhibition, is now open to
visitors on alternate weekends from 10.30am to 4.00pm on Saturday and
Sunday. The next open weekend is 23rd/24th April 1994. Admission is
UKPounds 2.00 (UKPounds 1.25 concessions and children), and includes a
90-minute guided tour of some of the wartime buildings, including the
original 'Hut 6'. There are associations with Alan Turing and other
notable names from the early days of scientific cryptography and
electronic computing.

Further information regarding progress at this famous site will be
posted as it becomes available.

Tony Sale - Secretary to the Computer Conservation Society."

Bletchley Park is 150 yards from Bletchley railway station on the line
from Euston station, and is signposted.  By car, it is off the B4034
Bletchley to Brackley road, and about seven miles from the M1.  The OS
grid reference of the entrance is SP 863 336.

The telephone number of the Bletchley Park Trust office is +44 (0) 908
640404.  It is staffed in office hours, and on open weekends.

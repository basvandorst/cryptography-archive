There are most certainly legal problems with using this software in the U.S.A.,
and probably also in several other countries, relating to a patent which 
covers the techniques used here.

ALSO BE SURE TO LOOK AT THE FILE PATCHES IN THIS DIRECTORY!!!

The following comes directly from PKP on the use of RSA within the 
U.S. and Canada. It seems to indicate that we may use RSA without
a licence for non-commercial purposes. I presume this applies to PGP
which is an RSA based system, but I really don't know. At least it
applies to RSAREF, the library being made available by RSA Inc
to North American users. 

For information on RSAREF send mail to rsaref@rsa.com. They'll send
it to you provided you state that you are either an American
or Canadian citizen or U.S. Permanent Resident located in the U.S.
or Canada and state that you agree to comply with the licence  
agreement.

"In North America, a license is needed to ``make, use or sell'' RSA. However,
PKP has a policy that anyone may use RSA non-commercially for a 
personal, academic or intellectual reason without a license; an example 
of such use would be the implementation of RSA as a programming project 
for a computer class. RSA Laboratories has made available (in the U.S. and
Canada) at no charge a collection of cryptographic routines in 
source code, including the RSA algorithm; it can be used for non-commercial
purposes"

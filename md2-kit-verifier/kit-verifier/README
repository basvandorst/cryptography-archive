Distribution files can be verified as faithful copies by comparing a known 
message digest that was computed on the original with one computed locally
on the alleged copy.

The known message digest is computed using MD2.  One may obtain routines to
verify MD2 by the following procedure:

1.  Obtain a copy of RFC 1115 (for example, from NIC)

2.  Extract the reference MD2 written in C to file md2.c

3.  Write a simple routine that sequentially reads the input file
    and passes each byte through MDUPDATE.
    
4.  Compare the results with the reference value.

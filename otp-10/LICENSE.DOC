                       SHAREWARE WITH A DIFFERENCE:

I have written this program both as a service to the public,
and for the purpose of supporting worthy nonprofit organizations.

I call this type of software "DonorWare"

You may evaluate it to see if it meets your needs.  If you find
this program useful or educational, I ask you to pay a fee.

Don't send the money to me, however.   I ask that all proceeds from this
version of OTP-PC be sent to support the Charles Darwin Foundation in
the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador.


    The Charles Darwin Research Station in the Galapagos Islands,
    Ecuador, is the operative branch of the Charles Darwin Foundation
    for the Galapagos Isles.  This international, non-profit
    conservation organization is dedicated to research and environmental
    education to support Ecuador's efforts to protect and conserve the
    fragile and unique flora and fauna of the Galapagos Islands.

Please send yor "registration" fee of $35.00 US funds (or more!) to:

Charles Darwin Foundation, Inc.
100 N. Washington Street, Suite 311
Falls Church, VA 22046
USA

FAX (703) 538-6835

Contributions are Tax deductible under United States tax laws!

Please note that the Charles Darwin Foundation is not responsible for
this software and can offer no support.  The Foundation does not provide
software updates or printed manuals for this product.

Please send me e-mail if you register your copy, I would like to know
DonorWare is working.

(DonorWare is a bit like putting public service messages on the sides of
delivery vans.  The difference is that I put the message in a software
package and release it to the public.)

You are free to use the program and source code for any personal,
non-profit purpose you wish.   You may port this program to other
environments, but I do ask that you keep the same license terms and data
formats.

(Let me know if you are doing a port so we can avoid duplication of effort).

Any for-profit use of DonorWare software must be approved by me.

Public domain code used in OTP-PC remains Public Domain, and I of course
put no restriction on its use.

I offer no warranty of any sort with this program.  You should evaluate
it and use it only if you feel it is appropriate for your needs.

Thanks,

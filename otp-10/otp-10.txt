Greetings:

I uploaded otp-10.zip to your directory:
OPT-PC was written by me, and I allow copies to be freely distributed.

Description:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


This is the first public release of OTP-PC, which is a MS-DOS
implementation of the one-time pad or Vernam Cipher.  The one-time pad
is the only encryption method proven to be unbreakable.

Complete source code, of course!



                      OTP-PC features:

-Automatic compression of plain text messages prior to encryption.
 Compression reduces consumption of the pad, and masks the size of the
 original document. (compression can be overridden)

-Automatic wiping of the pad (codebook), to prevent reuse on both
 encryption and decryption.

-Wiping and deletion of intermediate compressed files.

-Two stage cipher text headers.  The first stage header is un-encrypted,
 and contains information needed to start decryption.   The second stage
 contains sensitive information, and is encrypted.

-A 32 bit CRC stored in the encrypted header verifies reconstruction of
 the original file.

-A verbose mode which displays encryption/decryption statistics.

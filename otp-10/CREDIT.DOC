Philip Zimmermann, whose PGP public key system stimulated my 
interest in ciphers.



-LZH routines:

From PGP 1.0, I borrowed a public domain LZH compression routine, 
originally developed by Haruyasu Yoshizaki.  (see lzh.c for 
complete credit details).  The documentation for PGP 1.0 clearly 
states this source is in the public domain.



-CRC32:

The CRC32 routines are Copyright (C) 1986 by Gary S. Brown.

The source code for the routines state: "You may use this 
program, or code or tables extracted from it, as desired without 
restriction."

The CRC32 tables were calculated by Mark G. Mendel, Network 
Systems Corporation.


-GETOPT()  command line processor:

This code was written by Alex Measday, and appeared in the 
article "Enhanced Command Line Processing", in "The C Users 
Journal" Vol9 #6 on Page 75.   There was no restriction of source 
code mentioned in the article.

This piece of software greatly simplifies the task of writing 
command line based software.


-Random number information:


The following Internet draft paper has much useful information on 
the use of random numbers:  (thanks to Carl Ellison sending it to 
me)

"Randomness Requirements for Security" by Donald E. Eastlake 3rd, 
Stephen D. Crocker, & Jeffrey I. Schiller



Special Thanks to members of Cypherpunks, who provided 
information on random numbers, file wiping, and did Beta testing.

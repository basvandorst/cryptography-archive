Notes on building the Native libraries

For NT with Watcom C
	wmake -f makefile.NT
and to clean
	wmake -f makefile.NT clean
N.B. you MUST also have perl installed on your system
if you do not have perl goto http://www.perl.hip.com/

For Solaris with gcc
	make 
and to clean
	make clean

the mips version have NOT been tested YET.
so could be problems the older build was tested
but this one has not been
check the config/config.h.mips header is correct 
for your system before trying
make ARCH=mips

# 	mips	(irix53 with JDK1.03 from
# 		http://liawww.epfl.ch/~simon/java/irix-jdk.html)

after this you will have to ....

you will have to manually copy the shared libraries/dll's
to the correct place.

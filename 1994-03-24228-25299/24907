Well ... The FBI has always had the physical capability to tap any phone - so has any one else.  They have always been required to get a Court Order to actually
do it.  What the FBI wants is that the 'hooks' be put into digital telephony
systems so that they could still tap a phone under court order.  Those hooks 
could in fact be used by others but in any case what the FBI is trying to do
is to maintain a legal capability they have always had.  The FBI has NOT asked
to bug all phones -- that would be political suicide.  I hope this helps 
clarify the situation but then when dealing with conspiricy buffs...

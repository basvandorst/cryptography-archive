You could model a DES 56 bit key as a one time key pad.  It specifies one
of 2^^56 possible substitution alphabets for an alphabet the size of a
block (2^^64 possible symbols).

Actually it sounds like an electronic analogue of a rotor machine, although
1000 is kind of small for a rotor these days.

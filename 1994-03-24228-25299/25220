You could try a statistical analysis of the files to see if they appear 
to be random (they should).  They should also not be compressible with 
any compression program (pkzip, compress, lha, etc.).  This is not proof 
that the files are encrypted, let alone encrypted with DES, but if the 
files do not pass these tests, they are probably not encrypted.  Of 
course, if the files are uuencoded or some similar processing, the above 
tests should be done after uudecoding a copy of your original.

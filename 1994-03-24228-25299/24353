Unwinding the quantifiers in the assertion "P=NP", there is another
possibility: that for every problem in NP, there exists a solution in P,
but no uniform proof that *all* problems in NP have such solutions.
But this case turns out to be impossible, because of Cook's amazing result
on the existence of NP-complete problems.  Still, there could be other
headaches. eg: P=NP proved nonconstructively -- no program extractible from
the proof.  Or: explicit algorithm for traveling salesman, proved
nonconstructively to run in polynomial time -- program terminates in time 
Cx^n, for an unknowable value of  C (or n).

Similar pathologies can develop here. eg. NP-complete problem requires time
at least   C*2^n  for an unknowable value of C ---> not provably slower
than any particular polynomial.  Or: provably slower than any particular
polynomial, but no uniform proof that it's slower than *every* polynomial.

There are papers where P=NP is proved undecidable for certain
weak systems of arithmetic, and others where P=NP is analyzed
relative to various oracles.

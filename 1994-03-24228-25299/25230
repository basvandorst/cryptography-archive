I agree - as I have said in a previous post, devil's advocacy serves a useful 
function.  However, I contend that Mr. Sternlight has kept several discussions 
going for far too long - so long that any useful information had already been 
exchanged between the interested parties, and the discussion degenerates into 
an argument that bears no relation to the original subject material.

As to entertainment, I also subscribe to rec.humor.funny, and a few other 
groups whose purpose is not necessarily that of education and exchange of 
ideas.  It was my (perhaps fallacious) impression that groups like sci.crypt 
were intended to provide a forum for discussions of more, shall we say, 
*substance*.  I have a great sense of humor - but I don't think that 
_professional wrestling_ is all that entertaining, and Mr. Sternlight's 
sparring fests with some of the posters here bears a striking resemblance to a 
staged wrestling match.

BTW, in response to Pbosch: judging from some emails I've received in the last 
few days, what I said proved to be extremely useful to some people.  I'll even 
repeat it (paraphrased):

          Please folks, don't get sucked into a lose-lose argument with 
          someone who has repeatedly demonstrated that they *aren't* a devil's 
          advocate, but are instead an advocate of content-free slug-fests 
          intended to keep useful discussions from flourishing.

I stand by my post.

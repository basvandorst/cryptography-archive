   I'd like to get some input from different folks regarding what kind of 
   features, security, and so on they would like to have in a MS Windows 
   security program.  As you can see, I'm posting this through 
   ANON.PENET.FI, for obvious anonymity reasons; your responses will be 
   anonymized (is that a word? :-) in return, so please, speak your mind.
   
   -=-=-=-=-=-=-   the survey   -=-=-=-=-=-=-
   
    1> What algorithms would you like to see supported in a personal 
   cryptography program?
   	DES (how many modes?)
   	IDEA (how many modes?)
   	PGP
   	general public-key (ElGamal)
   	PEM
   	steganography
   	RSAREF
   	similar to DES/IDEA (byte-encrypted, not block-encrypted)
   
   
    2> Would you want an integral editor in the program, or would you prefer 
   to use your own?
   
   
    3> Would you want the program to provide uu-en/decoding?
   
   
    4> Would you want the program to provide data compression?
   
   
    5> Would you want the program to allow signing of plain-text messages?
   
   
    6> Would you want the program to maintain an _encrypted_ database (either 
   with the program, or on separate diskette) of passwords used to encrypt 
   files and messages?
   
   
    7> Would you want the program to include a master password, to prevent 
   unauthorized users?
   
   
    8> Would you want the program to terminate itself after some user-defined 
   period?  If so, what time range do you think would be appropriate?
   
   
    9> Would you want the program to support editing multiple documents?  If 
   so, how many?
   
   
   10> What language(s) would you like to see the program support?
   
   
   11> If the program included DES, IDEA, or RSA algorithms, would you be 
   willing to pay 'extra' to help cover licensing fees?
   
   
   12> What would you _really_ think a realistic price for such a program 
   should be (what's the most _you_ would pay for it), assuming NO DES/IDEA/RSA?
   
   
   13> Would you want the program to include 'security levels', similar to PGP?
   
   
   14> Would you want the program to allow 'read only' (no saving to disk or 
   printing) for text messages?
   
   
   15> Would you want the program to support some form of 'armoring'?
   
   
   16> Would you want the program to include 'encapsulation' - that is, the 
   ability to encrypt a message/file for one person, 'wrap' and send it to 
   another, and have that person 'unwrap' it, forward your still-encrypted data 
   to a third party?
   
   
   17> Would you expect the program to support mulitple recipients of the 
   same message/file?
   
   
   18> Would you want the program to support the PEM (Privacy Enhanced 
   Mail) standard?

Joy, oh, joy, another masterpiece!

Well, would you be doing a section on how to set up email encryption?
I mean, not just for Unix programs like Elm, but also for the DOS
side of the house.  Like how to set up PGP for use with OffLine eXpress,
BlueWave, etc.  There are many users out in the BBS world who would
really like that.

Have you looked into Terri Ritter's Penknife program?  I beleive that 
he is promoting it as an email tool as well.  If I remember right, it 
uses technology a little different than PGP and RIPEM.

: And finally, I am looking for people who are interested in
: reading a draft manuscript in mid-April.

Count me in.  I should be free around that time.  Would it be a mailed
thing or an emailed thing?

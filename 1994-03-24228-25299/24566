Help me!!!!  I have some important mail files but I no longer have the 
program that decrypts them... I've been working on the encryption method, 
but I come up short... I am almost positive that it has something to do 
with the mail number assigned to each individual..I have my number.. but 
I cant get anything to work.  If anyone had the encryption method for 
wordperfect mail, please send it to me...

Why should anyone trust you? Or me? Of course, nobody need trust anything
they read, see, or hear. We could be brains in vats... Or we can make
reasonable assumptions about the trustworthiness of what we perceive based
on its consistency.

Bruce has valuable things to say about many topics. If you choose to chuck
the baby with the bathwater, that probably works well for you. Based on
your other comments, my guess is that you have more than a passing
familiarity with cryptography and consider his book a very basic reader and
not revelatory in any way.

Now for those of us who are crypto tinkerers, his book and posts are
valuable. As are yours. Please get around to writing your own book(s) if
you haven't already done so.

Regards,
Reginald !:-)

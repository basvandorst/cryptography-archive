Please excuse a newbie question.  I was reading Bruce Schneier's
"Applied Cryptography" of DES's S-box substitution, which states:

  The input bits specify an entry in the S-box in a very particular
  manner.  Consider an S-box input of 6 bits, labeled b1...b6.
  Bits b1 and b6 are combined to form a 2-bit number, from 0 to
  3, which corresponds to a row in the table.  The middle 4 bits,
  b2 through b5, are combined to form a 4-bit number, from 0 to
  16, which corresponds to a column in the table.

As a programmer, this looks like BS to me.  A simple re-arranging
of the S-box table should yield a linear array that is directly
addressible by the 6 input bits.  Am I missing something here?

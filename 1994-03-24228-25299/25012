Secure RPC is not at all secure and has been broken due to the
ridiculously short modulus. You would think RSA would warn one of its
licensees about such a screw-up. They even advertise Secure RPC in their
brochure, as a wonderful RSA-secured product. Schneier points out that
your modulus should be prime and should allow you to prove your generator
is really a generator. There is a program called DHEX on csn.org (read
readme.mpj in /mpj to get into the crypto, and download my Secure Drive
while you're there!) which does Diffie-Hellman with a 1024-bit modulus and
generator.

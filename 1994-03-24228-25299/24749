I'm with Colin on this one.  Since sci.crypt isn't a refereed
publication, don't try to make your articles look like "reports" when
they have such clear defects.  I doubt you would have been flamed if
you'd said "Hey, here's an idea everyone ... what do people think?  Is
it new?  Is it secure?"

In the way you format your articles, you give yourself airs.

   I have heard of something called a key server which,

   this was a fairly old reference, tho. (93)
   Does anyone know if key servers still exists, where they are 
   and how you interact with them?

They still exist.  I run one. Send email to "pgp-public-keys@pgp.ox.ac.uk"
with the sujject line "HELP" (no quotes) and any message body you like.

   Also if they are secure.

The key servers act only as a distribution mechanism.  You should use
the PGP web-of-trust to determine the reliability of the keys you are
sent by a server.

I have deliberately avoided answering your question about whether the
server itself is tamperproof.  A moment's thought should convince you
that nothing is "tamper secure".  If nothing else, *I* could tamper
with the keys.

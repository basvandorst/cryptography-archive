I meant "slower" in the (apparently confusing) sense that the 
problem can't be solved as quickly as one which has polynomial-time
solutions.

However, the problem about the constant is a real one.  For example,
suppose you have a nonconstructive proof that some function is
at least  C*2^n  for some value of C, but no particular value of C can be
extracted from the proof. Then, for any particular polynomial  P(x), you
"know" that  C*2^n overtakes it but have no idea where.

The second pathology I had in mind is that there doesn't exist a proof that
the problem requires superpolynomial runtime, but for any given polynomial
P(x) there exists a proof that the problem has runtime at least P(x).

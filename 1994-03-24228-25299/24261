While perusing my local Barnes & Noble Bookseller, I came across a very
recently published book :

Applied Cryptography
(Pusblisher : Wiley)

This book is VERY cool indeed...  It contained TONS of comprehensive
information AND C language source code detailing how to implement
cryptographic methods..

I think it might be the BEST book on cryptography that I've seen yet...

Has anyone else here seen it?

Is it indeed the best (i.e. "most comprehensive") book on the subject?

Sincerely,

Michael Fischer

If you've encrypted it well, they will not know when they've decrypted
the first layer, or when they haven't.  Some programs include a header
on the encrypted data, and the header would be recoginzed if and when
someone successfully decrypts the first layer, even though the second
layer is still encrypted.  PGP does this, although recently there was a
program released called stealth-pgp, which does not add the
distinguishing headers to the pgp files, so that it can't be identified
if it is multi-layer encrypted.

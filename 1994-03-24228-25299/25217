             ***  Free Anti-Gun Info Number ***

An anti-freedom organization called Gun Fighters of America
has set-up an 800 number to advance the destruction of the
2nd Amendment and is paying 60-80 cents for your call each
you call. If you can't understand why they want too disarm
you, you may want to call back many times. Remember, each call
will cost Gun Fighters of America 60-80 cents. Call often !

            Free Info - 1 (800) 949-4867

Gun owners, hunters, target shooters will naturally have to
call many times as they are too dense to know why it is evil
to want to be free or own a gun.

Gun control advocates may want to call too to get the info on
why gun-owners are so evil and why freedom is so bad.

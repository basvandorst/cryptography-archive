   Me and everybody else in the world, since the statement is in the FAQ
   they have posted here.

Are you sure that's saying you can use the RSA algorithm, or only that

all the rules like not exporting and only calling the boring interface
routines instead of calling RSA dirctly.  That's what they've offered
in the past.

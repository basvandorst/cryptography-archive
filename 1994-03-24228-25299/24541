This seems to answer my earlier question about what reasons RSADSI would have
for not encouraging the use of pgp at academic sites --- they are probably
not making money off individual copies of ViaCrypt so aren't terribly
concerned with its success in terms of number of copies issued.

IMHO,
the way to widespread implementation of pgp in the United States then
is to convince ViaCrypt that it's a good idea to allow a freeware version
of it's software to be used at academic institutions, e.g., ".edu" sites.
This would seem to be good for a number of reasons:

1. PGP isn't terrible useful if no one else has a copy, so by its very
nature ViaCrypt should become a more successful product as more copies
of it exist in the world.

2. Academic sites would be willing to install ViaCrypt PGP if it
seemed legal, but are not willing to pay money for it it.

So, by licensing ViaCrypt PGP to ".edu" sites free, it would seem 
(according to this agrument, anyway) ViaCrypt could greatly improve sales
of commercial (e.g., ".com" sites) licenses. Of course, 
there are probably things in the contract with RSADSI that prohibit
this, but maybe it's worth looking into. It's just a thought. I'm
curious. Does anyone know more about this?

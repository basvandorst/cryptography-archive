Actually, it's more the case that news-servers can be configured to accept
or reject according to distribution.  So a UK machine might be configured to
reject anything with a US distribution, OTOH it might not.  Demon try and get
every article in every newsgroup - other providers may choose to reject
certain distributions.

Distribution headers should be regarded as advisory, not mandatory.

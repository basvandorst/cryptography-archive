In addition to my look at Zip encryption I am also interested in looking
at PKWare's authentication.  For this I am looking for 'putav' for versions
of PKZip other than 1.1.  There have also been rumours of 'av' cracking
programs circulating, if you have one or have seen one I'm also interested
in any details you can provide.

Oh, and if anyone suggests "using archie" perhaps they can explain how
to find the stuff I'm interested in rather than a thousand sites with
PKzip, Info-Zip's utilities, or even gzip!

Thanks,
    Anthony

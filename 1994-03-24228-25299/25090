A current note: some people here at UWM are factoring 100-102 digit
numbers in about three weeks using background time on a couple of
Decstations (also used for student projects) using HyperCube Sieve
factoring methods. Just a point of reference, I would guess $25k 
of non-special purpose computers would factor 100 digit hard numbers
at this point in quite less than 2 weeks. 

One thing to note about the underlying problem. The best approaches to 
factoring today are almost perfectly parallel. - That is the more money
and processors you have, the better - and in a linear fashion.

It would be nice to find a problem with a different scale factor -
add 10x the processors and get a 10% decrease in time needed to
solve. Any ideas?

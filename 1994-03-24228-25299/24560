A one-time pad system has the property that every valid message whose length is
the same as that of the encrypted message is an equally likely solution to the
decryption problem.  If the pad consists of truly random numbers, this system
is unbreakable without the key as long as there are multiple valid messages for
a given length.  It also means that any valid message of the proper length 
could have been produced by some key, in fact the XOR of that message with the
encrypted one.

Of course, if the D.A. does know the content of the message, he must also have
your key pad, which might make it hard to convince the judge that the second
key you are offerring is the correct one.  But it might work against "rubber
hose" solutions of the cipher.

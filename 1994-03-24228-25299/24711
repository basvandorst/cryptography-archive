Not true.  The first >>working<< stored program computer was EDSAC.
ENIAC has the distinction of being the first to publication, but 
it wasn't working when it was published.  Maurice Wilkes et al at 
Cambridge University who had been building EDSAC concurrently got
their machine working months before the americans did.

This is exactly why ciphers like DES, IDEA, etc. have multiple rounds,
i.e. they consist of many layers of ciphers--usually repeating
the same sequence of a few ciphers many times, but with different keys
much of the time. A serious hazard of using your own design is that
after you apply several layers of encryption your adversary
may discover that your cipher has in effect only one or two
layers because of a mathematical simplification. An example would
be using rot13 and periodic XOR alternately.  No matter how many times
you did this you would still have periodic byte substitution with
period=LCM of individual periods of the XOR steps.  If this LCM is
not huge the cipher is rather weak--although the rot13 steps
should be an inefficient but somewhat effective way to
make it a bit harder than plain XOR.

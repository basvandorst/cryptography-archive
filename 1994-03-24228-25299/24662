Ordinarily, I'd have said that the reach of U.S. law ends at our borders,
and that acts committed by U.S. citizens in another jurisdiction were a
matter for that jurisdiction, even if the U.S. citizen subsequently returned
to the U.S.

But with the Noriega case, I don't know what the practical situation is any
longer, and I venture to suggest neither does anyone else.

Note that I'm talking about what _is_, not what _should be_.

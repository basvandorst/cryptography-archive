Good point.  While we can reasonably be certain that intelligence agencies
WANT to snoop, we shouldn't overestimate their capability of doing so.  Or
UNDERestimate their ability to get it wrong even when they DO find out
something.

Many people who check out their own FBI files find a wealth of erroneous
or plain silly stuff in there.  A favorite anecdote of mine involves 
Erwin Knoll, publisher of The Progressive magazine.  He was shown 
(by his Congressman) a file containing a clipping of 
an article he published.  The yellowed newsprint was stamped "Classified."

And then there's the note scribbled by J. Edgar Hoover when he found out that
Jean Paul Sartres was a Communist:  "Find out who Sartres is!"

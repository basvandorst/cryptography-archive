For those who are not familiar with them, FPGAs (field programmable gate
arrays) are readily available and easily programmed.  You can think of them
as the `poor man's custom digital chip'.  The Xilinx gate
arrays are actually programmed with an external EPROM that the FPGA uploads
to configure itself, so the programming itself doesn't use any custom
hardware.

Anyway, for those who are interested in how fast DES (or RSA) can be
`cracked', take a look at the original article.

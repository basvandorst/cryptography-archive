It's encrypted with the IDEA algorithm, using a hash of your passphrase as
the key. The amount of security of your compromised "secring.pgp" depends
upon the passphrase you used to protect it and its vulnerability to a
"dictionary attack" or pure guessing, based on knowledge of you personally.

Presuming you used a limited number of commonly-used English words, the
amount of "keyspace" in your pass phrase is probably much less than the full
128 bits of entropy that a randomly chosen key would have.  That being the
case, a compromised "secring.pgp" presents a potential eavesdropper with an
easier method of deciphering your messages than either breaking the RSA
algorithm, or breaking the 128 bit random session key.  Assuming you know
(or have good reason to suspect) that it had fallen into the wrong hands, it
would be wise to revoke your old keys and generate new ones to limit any
potential FUTURE damage.

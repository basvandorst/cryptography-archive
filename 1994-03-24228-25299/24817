Ignoring the fact that the last half dozen of Terry's points are about
the wrapping, not the cipher itself (my complaints are with Penknife
the cipher vs. IDEA the cipher; I haven't even looked at Penknife the
application vs. PGP the application), PGP is great for sending large
binaries over the internet.  I use it for that purpose all the time.
"pgp -a" will ASCII-armor a file without encryption, and emit multiple
parts if the result would be too large for a mail message.  (Settable
by the armorlines parameter; default 720.)  It will conveniently
reassemble them too.  Try "pgp -a /usr/dict/words" some time.

(BTW, my current best 8086 and 68000 IDEA implementations are available
on Bruce Schneier's AC disks.  And C code that is much cleaner and
better documented than the bit in the book or DDJ which was ripped out
of PGP 2.2.  No, I won't send it to anyone myself; with the investigation
of PGP right now and my involvement, that's tempting fate.  But the code
itself is in the public domain, so I can't stop anyone else from
distributing it.)

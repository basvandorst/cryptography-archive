   Does the avalable Clipper specification promise for the available implementation that
   all bits encrypted coming out will match all going in?  If it were to rely on the
   "fact" that its datastream is digitized "voice telephone grade" sound of a particular
   format, might it not twiddle a few low order bits?

From any descriptions of Clipper I've seen, there's no particular
reason for limiting it to voice except that the encrypted data is
bigger than the unencrypted data (by the size of the LEAF),
which is really annoying for computer data and requires lots of
thinking about how to deal with it usefully, whereas for voice
applications it's just a bit of startup delay.  (Also for low-bit-rate
video applications.)  The other reason for it is they have an easier
time arguing that criminals use phones than that criminals use Ethernet,
and Clipper is fundamentally trying to solve a political problem
(how to get the public to allow limitations on crypto when there's no
good legal justification for doing so.)

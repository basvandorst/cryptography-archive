While I agree that no characters should be shown at all, I think you
are overestimating the damage that displaying asterisks will do.

Suppose the passphrase contains n characters chosen from an alphabet of
size a. Trying all password lengths up to (but not including) n involves
1 + a + a^2 + ... + a^(n-1) = (a^n - 1) / (a - 1) tests.  Trying only the
length n passwords requires a^n tries.

Hence trying all passwords <= n in length increases the work required
by a factor of (a^n - 1)/(a^n(a - 1)). For a^n large this is approximately
1/(a-1).

If a = 62 (alphabet of [A-Za-z0-9]) this represents an increase in time
to crack the password by brute force of about 1.6%.

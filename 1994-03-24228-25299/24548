As I said, terms of a licence may vary. But a licence is required for 
commercial use. I also have dealings with ASCOM

IMO whether 'you' are offered a licence for a one-time fee, a royalty on sales 
or some combination of both is immaterial. Payment is made for value recieved.

You confuse a simple issue by going in one step from manufacturer to end-user.
But any way you choose to cut the cake, Microsoft receive money for every 
copy of Word that is legally used. The fact that none of the actual, physical 
coin paid by end-users is passed to Microsoft is immaterial. Microsoft are 
paid for value given in respect of every copy of Word.

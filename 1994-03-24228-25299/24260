This is similar to how the Kerberos (created at MIT) works... the problem is
that it is difficult to implement this software between different systems --
not due to software but human conventions.  A system that didn't use
Kerberos wouldn't be able to access one that did, and the system that does use
it wouldn't want to even allow ones that didn't to access it.  There's no
way to incorporate backwards compatability into the scheme without losing 
just about all of the benefits, so people are slow to adopt it.  Pretty 
impressive that someone who knows "little" about encryption and the protocals
could come up with this independantly... maybe you should go work for MIT.

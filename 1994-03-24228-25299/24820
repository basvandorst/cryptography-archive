I've added yet another option to the SFS driver which will echo passwords for
those who want this (along with dire warnings in the docs about how easy it is
to read them using TEMPEST techniques).  This'll be in the next release (along
with somewhat faster direct disk access for IDE drives, and a few bugfixes (or
at least a mention in the docs of open problems, because some of the problems
are so bizarre I'm not sure if solutions exist)).

I think system admins are under *permanent* psycholgical stress: "Why can't I
log on?  Why doesn't printing work?  When will news be back again?  I've
deleted all my files, can you recover them?  Why does my program crash?  When
will....".

Footnote: Apologies for the confusion about the release announcement (the
          doubled posting, and the fact that the posts came from opposite sides
          of the planet).  Our news system has been sick for quite awhile...

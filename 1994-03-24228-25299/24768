Check out STATTAB.  Here's a repost of the announcement of the latest
version.  You might also consider using CDFLIB, the library upon which
STATTAB is based, to write your own program to generate tables.

                             STATTAB 1.2

STATTAB  calculates  the  cumulative distribution functions, inverses,
and  values of parameters for   the  statistical distributions listed
below.  


              1 - Incomplete Beta          
              2 - Binomial                 
              3 - Negative Binomial        
              4 - Chi-square               
              5 - Non-central Chi-square   
              6 - F                        
              7 - Non-central F            
              8 - Incomplete Gamma         
              9 - Normal                   
             10 - Poisson                  
             11 - T                        


It can also produce tables of any one calculated item as a function of
a specified list of values of another item.

The  Fortran  source for  STATTAB  is available by  anonymous ftp from
odin.mda.uth.tmc.edu  (129.106.3.17)  on ./pub/unix/stattab-1.2-tar.Z.
An MSDOS executable  is  contained in  ./pub/msdos/stattb12.exe.   The
latter is a self-extracting file packed with a licensed copy of PKZIP.

STATTAB is an interactive packaging of cdflib, whose Fortran source is
available on ./pub/unix/cdflib.f-1.4-tar.Z.

                           DEC Alpha Users

Routine zror.f  on either  cdflib or  stattab   will not  compile  and
execute correctly on the DEC Alpha machine.   We have communicated the
problem to  Digital.  In  the meantime,  users  of that machine should
replace the  version supplied with cdflib or  stattab with the  one on
./pub/unix/zror.alpha.f.Z.

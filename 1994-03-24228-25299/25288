    A perfect example of non-productive posts (the above and then any
        responses .. even my own).

     If the people who posted several months ago about moderating would
     like to step forward (I only recall Bob ... I've forgotten the other
           individuals)
     and decide whether they would be able & willing to moderate; I would
     be more than willing to help out (perhaps screening the junk mail
       and then forwarding technical queries and potential postings on
       to whomever should wish to moderate and decide what to post).

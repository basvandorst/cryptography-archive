Subject: OK to set client sys time from Kerberos KRB_AS_REP?

The KRB_AS_REP (in Kerberos V.5, anyway) has a field for the 
server's current time, which is in the portion of the message 
encrypted in the client's secret key (if I'm reading the 
document right). Is it considered safe to use this time field 
to set the system clock (or at least the version of it used 
subsequently for generating authenticators)? 

If not, could somebody sketch a scenario in which this would 
facilitate an attack?

Thanks!

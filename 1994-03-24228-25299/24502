CRYPT-X

Anyone writing their own cipher algorithm may be interested in this computer
package.

The Crypt-X package contains a number of statistical tests which may be used
to measure different randomness properties applied to both stream and block
ciphers.

Crypt-X is a comprehensive user friendly package for the IBM and compatible PC.
It is a menu-driven package featuring a user interface, VGA high resolution
colour graphics and help support.

Crypt-X can be applied to testing encryption algorithms, used as block and
stream ciphers, from a black box point of view.

Output to disk is provided as well as to the screen.

Input instructions are clearly presented on the screen, backed up thoroughly
by the Crypt-X manual, which for every test, provides examples and
interpretations.

Crypt-X runs on an IBM386 (or later) or compatible PC using a VGA monitor.

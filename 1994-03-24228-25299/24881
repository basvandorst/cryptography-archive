Well, the change would be upward compatible.  If a site wants to continue
running the way it has in the past, processing all or some control messages,
more power to it, but if a site wants to verify digital signatures on cancels,
rmgroups, and newgroups, there "ought to" be an RFC written on how to do that.

Not in our lifetime, probably.

:
:Applied Cryptography; Bruce Schneier; John Wiley 1994
 
Quoting him as the author of a book still does not tell anyone who he is.
Since he did not get his basic facts right about the Quadratic Sieve
and its implementation, why should anyone believe anything else he says?
What refereed papers has he written on the subject?

:>In any event, he has his facts wrong. The first implementation of the

:>He took about 70 hours to do a 47-digit number.
:
:What has that got to do with what I said?
 
You quoted Schneier as saying that in 1980 a Cray could do 82 digits
in a few hours. I pointed out that noone had yet done a QS implementation
in 1980 and that it would take more than just a few hours on the hardware
of that time. Since Schneier has his basic facts wrong, why should anyone
trust him?

:>Davis and Holdridge did not do their QS implementation until May of
:>1983. The first number they factored was a 51-digit cofactor of 7^67+1.
:>They improved their code until they factored a 71-digit number in
:>March 1984. That 71 digit number took 9.5 hours on a Cray-XMP.
:
:Schneier's exact quote is:
:
:(p.212) "In 1970 the big news was the factoring of a 41 digit hard number.
:... Ten years later, factoring hard numbers twice that size took a few hours
:of work by a Cray Computer." I get 82 digits as twice that size. I get 1980
:as ten years later.
 
Schneier was wrong. Or rather, was being *very* approximate both in time 
and in size.

 That is all I am saying.

 
:Glad to hear you agree. Have you written any books on Cryptography I might
:read to compare your treatment of these matters with Schneier's?
 
Books, no. Many journal papers, yes. Furthermore, I *was there* as all
this algorithm technology unfolded....

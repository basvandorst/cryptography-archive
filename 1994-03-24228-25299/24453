Version 1.00 of a new steganography toolkit for MS Windows 3.1 is now
available by email from me.

S-Tools conceals files within Windows WAV sound files, and is of course
able to extract previously hidden files. The modified sound file is
indistiguishable to the human ear (well it is to mine anyway!). S-Tools
supports 8 and 16 bit WAV files, in mono or stereo.

The registered version of S-Tools supports encryption of files as they are
hidden in the sound wave. The encryption algorithms supported are IDEA,
DES, 3DES and MPJ2, in ECB and CBC modes of operation. You get the source
code if you register so you can satisfy yourself as to the security of the
implementation.

If you want a copy of S-Tools then mail me and I'll send you a uuencoded
copy. Offers to place it on an ftp site would be greatly appreciated :)

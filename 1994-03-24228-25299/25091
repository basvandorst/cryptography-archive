**************      Mark your calendars for the ****************************

                          Sixth Annual
         Computer Security Incident Handling Workshop

                     Boston, Massachusetts
                        July 25-29, 1994

                            Hosted by
                              FIRST
        The Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams

Since November of 1988, there has been an almost continuous stream of
security-related incidents that have affected thousands of computer systems
and networks throughout the world. To address this threat, a growing number
of government and private sector organizations in North America, Europe and
Australia have worked together to exchange information and coordinate response
activities.

This coalition, known as the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams
(FIRST), brings together a variety of computer security incident response
teams from the government, commercial, and academic organizations.  FIRST
aims to foster cooperation and cordination in incident prevention, to
prompt rapid reaction to incidents, and to promote information sharing
among members and the community at large.

The annual Incident Handling Workshop is part of FIRST's ongoing program of
education and awareness for its members and others.  The workshop is
targeted at the growing number of computer security professionals who must
deal with increasingly sophisticated security incidents and system
vulnerabilities.

The focus of this year's three day workshop is on tools for incident
handling in an international arena.  The workshop is being conducted as a
series of tutorials, seminars, and hands-on sessions on related topics. The
presentations will focus on tools that are utilized in incident handling
such as:

  o intrusion/vulnerability detection tools
  o system/network monitoring tools
  o informational resources
  o legal and administrative issues in incident handling
  o international incidents
  o incident handling and the National Information Infrastructure

Plans for this year's workshop are being finalized. If you have questions

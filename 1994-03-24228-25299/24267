Gus Simmons gave me permission to distribute a paper of
his on subliminal channels in DSS.  The paper is well-done,
but I wish I could say the same about the way that I am distributing
it.  I had to scan it in to .tiff files and put those up for
FTP.  The copy I received wasn't good enough for OCR to work 
reasonably.  So, you'll need an image viewer to read the files.

Look for it on ripem.msu.edu:/pub/crypt/docs

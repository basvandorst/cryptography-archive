There are standards for DES and its use, and for digital signatures.  Look
for products that conform to the standards - they should interoperate.

There are also U.S. government (NIST) certification tests for implementation
of the DES algorithm and for MAC functions.  If you're using either of these,
ask if the product has passed the NIST certification.  (I suspect there are
similar certifications in other countries, and perhaps for other algorithms.)

Tests and standards like these are essential for major users of cryptography,
such as banks.  The whole banking system would fall apart of the message
encrypted/MAC'd/signed/etc. by one bank couldn't be handled by another bank.

Yes, in fact, one can almost always distinguish between compressed 
text/program files (compressed with gzip, compress, freeze and 
presumably others) and files encrypted with DES or IDEA with some
simple calculations.

But as for determining whether a file is encrypted with DES as
opposed to other algorithms; this is probably hard. 

The key is that the encrypted files appear to be "a bit more random" 
than compressed files, even when we use a very good algorithm for 
compression.

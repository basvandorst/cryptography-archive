     You need to look into the history of the SOE rather than 
     cryptography.  Maurice Buckmaster's memoirs (They Fought
     Alone) describes the practice with some detail.  There's
     also a bunch of memoirs from SOE operators and French
     resistance fighters that may give more specific examples.

I really don't see how this differs from any other wiretap.  If info is  
obtained illegally it is inadmissible.  If a federal agent is a dirtbag  
and is going to listen illegally, then if they are listening to a  
telephone, carphone, Clipper, etc. is irrelevant.  I think you are  
confusing distrust of Clipper with distrust of the government.

Subject:   Hardware Implementations
Lines: 20


In the FAQ there are several pointers to DES chips/boards.  Does anyone
know of any other hardware implementations of block ciphers?  Any new
info on DES hardware not in the FAQ?  Prices?  Specs?

The DES chips in the FAQ were all *fast* and emphasis was on the faster
ones.  I need a slow one :) ... or rather don't want to pay extra for
speed I don't need :)  I'm look at around 10kbps.

Mail me what you know and if there's enough interest I'll post a
summary - thanks a lot!

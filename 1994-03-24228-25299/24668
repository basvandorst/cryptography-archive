Excellent work, Phil.

I especially like the paragraph in the determination request
letter:

"There are no military standards or specifications that this diskette is
designed to meet.  There are no special characteristics of the diskette,
including no radiation-hardening, no ballistic protection, no hard
points (the corners of the diskette are rounded), no TEMPEST
capability, no thermal and no infrared signature reduction capability,
no surveillance, and no intelligence gathering capability.  The diskette
does not use image intensification tubes."

I wonder if they thought that was funny?  :-)


This seems to be a significant development because I do not think
State has explicitly exempted crypto software, even if a line-by-line
copy of a book in the public domain, from licensing.  This develoment
essentially means if you want to distribute the software, first
publish it on paper.

The Digital Telephony bill has been around for a session or two...
little chance of passage.  But it does show how much the spooks and
other folks who believe in invasive government seem to dominate
the Adminstration...any Administration :(

Even David Sternlight opposes this bill and he trusts the government
and its intentions a lot more than most of us.  (You did say you
opposed this, didn't you David?)

I really like how, in this session of Congress, the bill has
a "privacy improvement" title to it ;)  Swine...genuine swine.

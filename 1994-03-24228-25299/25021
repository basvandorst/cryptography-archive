+     The Conus Code Chip, known as the Triple "C" Technology is here!
+It does not rquire Key administration, key management, or escrowed keys.
+ 
+     Faster than DES, it is a one time key pad random combined substitution,
+permutation cipher feedback offset counter algorithm, that will set a bank
+of Cray computers searching until eternity for a patern
+ 
+     Each session is a totally seperate random encryption taken for several
+tables of over 1000 symbols each, that cannot be broken by electronic,
+machanical, or mathematical means.
+ 
+     The hardware is about the size of a deck of cards, and the software is
+minimal, and with the click of the mouse in windows, you select and encrypt
+a file then store it on your hard disk, floppy, or flash card. Then sent
+at anytime by any means, network, modem, wireless or fiber optics.
+ 
+     Many Industry leaders are involved, and pilot programs have been

	What is a "one time key pad random combined substitution,
permutation cipher feedback offset counter algorithm"?? 

	Presumably, if it's using a "one time pad" repeatedly,
in any way, then it's not really a one time pad. So is this doing
some kind of random walk over what amounts to a large internal
codebook?

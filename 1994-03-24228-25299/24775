Depends on many things:
+   if he is actually an employee of the USG what are the terms of his
    employment contract?
+   if he is a USG employee, did he file the patent before his employ
    by the USG?
+   if he is a USG employee, did he do the work on which the patent is
    based before his employ by the USG?
+   if he is a USG employee, is his work related to software or RNGs?
+   if he is a USG employee, did he negotiate an exception with his
    bosses for exploring a hobby?

ROFL


From what I've seen he is doing no more than fulfilling the requirements
of maintaining his patent, ie notifying people when they are advocating
the use of a method he believes covered by his patent.  This seems
particularly sensible given that the postings concerned claimed the
method was 'unpatentable'.

The State Department is indeed the 'expert' in this area since the rules are
written in an ambiguous way. Currently they assert that all 'software'
(i.e., magnetic domains and/or algorithmic representations) are munitions, but
they seem to make an exception when it comes to, say, textbooks or FIPS 180
on servers.  They undoubtedly don't challenge textbooks in order to avoid
a First Amendment case that would be hopeless for them to win.

But their vague definition of the edges is what makes them arbitrary and
self-serving.  If the Austin Code Works had not acquired munitions
registrations I would be publishing a book of freeware PGP source code
in an easy to OCR format.

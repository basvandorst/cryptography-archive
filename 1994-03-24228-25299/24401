A little sidebar in Dr. Dobb's Developer Update has the following item:

Crypto Chip Debuts
National Semiconductor has released the iPower encryption chip,
which is designed for use in PCMCIA cards and provides a range of
security features. The chip can encrypt data via multiple
encryption algorithms, and will self-destruct upon any tampering
attempt, using a self-contained chemical. Cards that use the iPower
chip can also provide additional functions such as tracking user
access times. The iPower division is based in Santa Clara, CA
408 721-8797.

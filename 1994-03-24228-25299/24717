Subj: Questions about a one-time pad cypher

	Here is a cypher I wipped up, that I will
call the internet cypher.

	Since I know very little about the science
of cryptography, I have these questions:

1. What is the estimated strength of this cypher?
2. How long would it take to break, and on what
   type of machine?
3. Could I email code that performed this cypher to
   say, England?
4. What bibliography would you suggest to help
   me understand cryptography better?
5. How can this cypher be improved?

		DETAILS of Internet Cypher
		--------------------------

Given the following Box Transformations:
---------------------------------------

  GZIP Box
  --------

	Accepts an input stream and gzip's the
	file to produce an output stream.

  IDEA Box
  --------

	Accept a key and a data stream and
	produces an output based on the
	IDEA encryption algorithm.

  DES/CBC Box
  -----------

	Accepts a key and a data stream and
	produces an output based on the
	DES/CBC encryption algorithm.

  MD5 Box
  -------

	Accepts a key phrase and produces
	an MD5 digital signature

  ls-lR Box
  ---------

	Accepts a key and produces a byte
	stream based on:

	1) use key to index into ls-lR file
	2) fetch this file over the internet.
	   Higher security would be achieved by
	   storing all files on a jute box
	   locally and not using the internet.
	3) run through GZIP Box
	4) produce output byte stream

  XOR Box
  -------

	Accepts two streams of data and
	produces an XOR output of the
	stream.

Thus, to encrypt data, you would do:
------------------------------------

       key-phrase -> MD5 Box -> key
                                |
            key -> ls-lR Box -> DES/CBC Box
                                |        |
                                |        ----> XOR -> Cypher-Text
                                |        ----> Box
      Plain-Text -> GZIP Box -> IDEA Box |

Notes:
	1) permute the key-phrase and run through
	   MD5 as many times as needed to produce
	   enough key bits.

	2) if the ls-lR box is asked for more data
	   than is in the fetched file, it will
	   fetch another file based on the key

	3) all sites participating with this cypher
	   group use the same ls-lR box.

	4) The internet cypher would shutdown further
	   encryption after it had encrypted the sum of all data in
	   the ls-lR Box.
	   - or -
	   Keep track of all MD5 keys generated, and never
	   use one of them again for encryption.

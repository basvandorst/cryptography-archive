Sorry to hear you're not keeping up:

Applied Cryptography; Bruce Schneier; John Wiley 1994

What has that got to do with what I said?

Schneier's exact quote is:

(p.212) "In 1970 the big news was the factoring of a 41 digit hard number.
... Ten years later, factoring hard numbers twice that size took a few hours
of work by a Cray Computer." I get 82 digits as twice that size. I get 1980
as ten years later.

Schneier's reference for the 1970 claim is Morrison and Brillhart in
Mathematics of Computation v.29 n.129 Jan 1975 pp.183-205;
His reference for "ten years later" is Davis, Holdbridge, and Simmons in
Advances in Cryptology-CRYPTO '84 proceedings, Springer Verlag 1985 pp.
183-215.

That's nice. What has that got to do with what I said?

That's nice. The point is that that's well within the budgets of lots of
people.

Glad to hear you agree. Have you written any books on Cryptography I might
read to compare your treatment of these matters with Schneier's?

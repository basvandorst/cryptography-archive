   3) I've heard from credible sources that as of the early 1980's, the
   US military was encrypting classified data with RSA, with moduli of
   about 3000 bits, and with the public exponent chosen at random in this
   3000 bit range, subject to a few conditions.  Civilian RSA programs
   including PGP seem to always use small constants as public exponents
   because this makes encryption and signature checking run a lot faster.
   At least some theorists at the time seemed to think large random
   exponents gained you some security.  I don't know what the
   justification was, or whether it's still believed.


If the exponent is larger than the size of the modulus in bits, you
don't have to worry about the exponentiated message being smaller than
the modulus, leading to a trivial deciphering.  Otherwise, you have to
ensure that the message is padded with random data.

For instance, if my RSA modulus was 77 and my encryption exponent was
3, then for the messages 8, 27 and 64 it is trivial to extract the
cube root.  If the exponent was >= 7, however ...

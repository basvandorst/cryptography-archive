Subject: PKZIP Encryption Question
Lines: 16

I have two questions about PKZIP's encryption scheme:

1. Does PKWARE provide the same encryption scheme in the PKZIP program it
   sells in the US and Europe? For instance, if someone encrypted a file
   using the German version of PKZIP, could I unzip and unscramble it here
   using the US version (assuming I knew the password).

2. How secure is PKZIP's encryption scheme?

I'd appreciate any answers or comments.

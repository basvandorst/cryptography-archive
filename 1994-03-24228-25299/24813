Is that paper available anywhere now?

Is there an "optimum" number of keys to use in the nDES stage? (Other
than "the more the better".)  Would there be some cryptographic advantage in
choosing an odd number of keys so that the cycle (n * 8 bytes) was not
evenly divisible into the 8K TRAN block size?

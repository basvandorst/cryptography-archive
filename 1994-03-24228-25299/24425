   I'm not saying it makes sense to retrict crypto exports, but
   given that such restrictions exist, it is rational to
   apply them to software that is on media as opposed to printouts.
   The latter is *never* a compnent of a crypto.  The former
   is in some instances.

Take your printout.  Feed it into a scanner and an optical character reader
program on your computer.  Execute.  Works fine.

If you're in a third-world country, hand it to a typist.  Execute.  Works fine.

Take your algorithm, print it in the Federal Register, and export it.
Programmers overseas will write code and implement it.  Execute.  Works fine.
(Actually, some of them will adapt American-written code instead :-)
That works pretty fast,too.  But there's good code that isn't from Yankees.)

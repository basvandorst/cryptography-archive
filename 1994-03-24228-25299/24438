This is incorrect. Ascom Tech AG (the holders of the patent on
IDEA) have given permission for use of IDEA in PGP for _any purpose_.
At least Phil says this is so.

The relevant passage from the PGP docs (pgpdoc2.txt) follows:
The IDEA(tm) conventional block cipher used by PGP is covered by a
patent in Europe, held by ETH and a Swiss company called Ascom-Tech
AG.  The patent number is PCT/CH91/00117.  International patents are
pending.  IDEA(tm) is a trademark of Ascom-Tech AG.  There is no
license fee required for noncommercial use of IDEA.  Ascom Tech AG
has granted permission for PGP to use the IDEA cipher, and places no
restrictions on using PGP for any purpose, including commercial use.
You may not extract the IDEA cipher from PGP and put it in another
commercial product without a license.  Commercial users of IDEA may
obtain licensing details from Dieter Profos, Ascom Tech AG, Solothurn
Lab, Postfach 151, 4502 Solothurn, Switzerland, Tel +41 65 242885,
Fax +41 65 235761.

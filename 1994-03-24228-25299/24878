Ideally, "Fudge Motors" should make sure that more than one *TRUSTED*
employee has access to the password.  That would protect them in case an
employee needed to be terminated, or if he/she should be incapacitated for
some other reason.  Of course, if *YOU* were that employee who alone knew
the password, this would give you a certain amount of "leverage" and/or "job
security".  Many managers of small companies simply are not knowledgeable
enough about crypto to understand the consequences of trusting a single
employee with that much responsibility.

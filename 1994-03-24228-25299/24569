BUT, the book 'APPLIED CRYPTOGRAPHY' is available in the US and abroad.
I believe I have seen messages from GE and UK stating that the book was 
available there.  Even if you can't fin the book in your local computer
book store, you can probably order it.  Here is the book info:
    APPLIED CRYPTOGRAPHY
    Protocols, Algorithms, and Source Code in C
    by Bruce Schneier
    ISBN: 0-471-59756-2
    publisher: John Wiley and Sons, Inc.
               Professional, Reference and Trade Group
               605 Third Avenue, New York, N.Y.  10158-0012  (USA)
               New York . Chichester . Brisbane . Toronto . Singapore
The cost of the book is $44.95 (US).  From what I have read, there is a
company that you can order the book from for overseas (expect to pay
for the export and shipping).

The reason you might want this book is because it has FULL SOURCE CODE
(in C) for many algorithms.  The algorithm for DES (double and triple)
is spelled out from pages 467 to 485.  The book goes into detail about
the algorithm as well as other algorithms.  Grab a copy of the book 
while you can.

While I do not wish to see this thread continue to waste bandwidth, I
would like to clarify my affiliation, which Mr. Colin James III has
chosen to ignore for whatever reasons.

I am affiliated with Precision Software Products of San Francisco, CA.
My primary functions have been in the area of strategic planning and
ongoing design and implementation of office and research automation
using local and wide-area networks. A significant component of that
planning and design has been establishing and maintaining data
intgerity and information security.  Over the last couple of years
more of the focus has gone into providing secure communication links
for commercially sensitive data and with that, an increased interest
in cryptographic solutions.

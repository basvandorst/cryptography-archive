You might want to confirm this first, before announcing it.

An old college friend of mine is (or was, as of last summer) in charge
of their e-mail group, and he told me last summer when we last talked
that Prodigy fully understands the implications of the ECPA and does
not look at e-mail.

(I suspect they might, if a court order was involved. As most or all
services would do. But the context of our discussion was whether or
not Prodigy checked e-mail for the same "dirty words" that they
disallow in public messages--he said they don't look at mail.)

I am using notation that is consistently used by number theorists. If you
want to discuss number theory [and this is a discussion about number theory]
then you use that notation.

If you ever read a math book which has  a mod b = c, the "=" sign is
NEVER taken to mean equality. 

:meant the equal sign (as in equals over the integers, *NOT* as an equivalence
:relation mod n or as equals over Z/nZ).  You are the one who is reinterpreting 
:it.  We are using mod in this case to mean a binary *operator*, it is *NOT* 
:an equivalence relation mod n.  As an operator (mod as a function ZxZ->Z),
 
The binary operator mod n is mathematically equivalent to doing arithmetic
in Z/nZ. The equal sign is ALWAYS taken to mean equivalence and not
equality. If you want to use non-standard notation, fine. But you will
confuse less-than-expert readers.

:unique integer answer 1.  Can I be more clear?  :-) 
 
4 mod 3 does NOT have a unique answer, your insistence to the contrary.
This is made absolutely clear when you start considering negative moduli,
for example. 
 
It makes no sense, mathematically, to speak about modular arithmetic
without equivalence relations.

To continue.

As best as I can determine it is not an infringement to discuss the
details of a patent, and I propose to discuss Colin James III's patent
5,251,165.  This will be boring, and I ask net readers to bear with me.

Our right to open discussion of cryptography has been threatened, or at
least so I perceive it, by Colin James III's ex parte email to several
members of this newsgroup claiming that their discussions, or parts of
their discussions, infringed his patent.  We should remember the 1979
letter of Joe Myer(sp?) threatening an earlier discussion of cryptography
with criminal violations.  Joe Myer was an NSA employee, and a natural
suspicion was that the NSA was attempting to suppress speech as well as
scientific inquiry.  I don't suppose, nor am I claiming, that Colin James
III is acting on behalf of the NSA.  What I do say is that he may have
an exaggerated understanding of the rights granted to him by his
patent, with the effect that we can no longer discuss cryptography freely
until this matter is cleared up.

I'm not a lawyer, and my interpretations will be subject to error.
Anybody is invited to correct me.

The patent is hard to follow, which I'm told is how patents are written.
It goes into excruciating explanations of tangential technical points
until you want to scream, and leaves the details of the essential claims
so poorly covered that the reader can only be baffled.	Since I'm not
writing a patent, I'll try to cut through the gobbledygook.  Again,
anybody is invited to correct my errors of interpretation.

In general, the patent is not particularly about software.  The patent
really covers an idea conveniently cloaked in hardware circuits.  It is
not clear to me that this patent covers the prngs algorithms in C that we
have been discussing.  However, I have been told that this is how software
patents are written up.  The idea is, let the courts decide whether or not
the software patent is valid.

The first thing I noticed was that George Marsaglia was never mentioned in
this patent's review of prior art.  Why is that?  Marsaglia is _the_ world
authority on rngs, and I do not understand how any search of prior art in
random number generators can be considered thorough without a mention of
him.  I say that the search of prior art described in this patent is
incomplete.  I ask Colin James III to explain how I am wrong.

This patent uses the term "circular buffer".  It is in fact a table
lookup, of what is not clear, but presumably of random numbers.  The
patent does not explain how the table is initialized.  I presume with
random numbers.  Basically, random numbers are looked up in a table
according to random indexes, which the patent describes as being generated
by some "conventional" rng.  As I read it, the essence is table lookup.  I
ask Colin James III does he claim ownership of table lookups to generate
random numbers, or just of the particular method described to access table
elements?  As I read the patent, table lookups are not covered.  I ask
Colin James III to correct me if I'm wrong.

What is covered is one rng being used to access a random value from a
second rng.  Wherein does this differ from the Marsaglia-MacLaren random
number generator known to us as Algorithm M in Knuth's Vol II?

It is not at all clear how the table is loaded, or with what.  I guess
that the "conventional" rng seeds the table.  It is not clear from the
patent whether or not the final output is the input table!  My guess is
that it is, but there is nothing I can find that says so.

The "conventional" rng described seems to be a shift register.  As I read
the patent, no claim is made for this.	I ask Colin James III to correct
me if I read it wrong.

I fail completely to see how this rng is the same as Peter Bosch's rng,
which as I recall it, is the same as the early Geheimschreiber, but using
byte-wide numbers instead of bit-wide numbers.	One rng is not used to
pluck values from a second.  I ask Colin James III to explain, or have his
lawyer explain, how his patent covers Peter Bosch's rng.  If he does claim
so, how does he reconcile his claim against the Geheimschreiber (described
several years ago in an article in the Annals of the History of
Computing).  And how does he reconcile his review of prior art with this
article?

As I said, what worries me is the chilling effect that patent claims and
threats of lawsuits will have on open discussion of cryptography.

More later.

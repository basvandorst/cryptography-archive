Subject: winpgp10.zip - Friendly Windows 3.1 GUI for MS-DOS PGP 2.3a

I have uploaded to the SimTel Software Repository (available by anonymous
ftp from the primary mirror site OAK.Oakland.Edu and its mirrors):

pub/msdos/windows3/
winpgp10.zip    Friendly Windows 3.1 GUI for MS-DOS PGP 2.3a

WinPGP is a shell for the MS-DOS PGP 2.3a encryption/decryption program.
It is the easiest way to use PGP from a Windows environment.  It provides
a very friendly way to encrypt, decrypt and sign your message using PGP.
Documentation is provided as a context sensitive Windows help file.

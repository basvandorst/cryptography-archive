   Well, the change would be upward compatible.  If a site wants to continue
   running the way it has in the past, processing all or some control messages,
   more power to it, but if a site wants to verify digital signatures on cancels,
   rmgroups, and newgroups, there "ought to" be an RFC written on how to do that.

A cheaper approach than full-scale digital signatures, which gives you
authentication without  requiring key distribution or patent issues,
is to use MD-5 or equivalent hashing.  Modify inews to generate a
random number R, hash H = MD5(R), and include a header line
	Control-Authorization-Challenge: H
and return it to the user through some appropriate interface.
The cancel software would  require cancel messages to include a header line
	Control-Authorization: R
which gets hashed to verify that it equals H and is authorized to cancel.
A variation which allows the sysadmin to also do cancels would
generate R1 and R2, give the user R1 and the sysadmin R2, 
generate H1=MD5(R1) and H2=MD5(R2) and include a header line
	Control-Authorization-Challenge: H1 H2

I think you guys are still thinking "passwords".  I use key phrases.  I
compose a short, original poem paying attention to metrics.  Because
they must be one-liners they usually come out as epigrams.  These are
easy to remember because of meter, so I never need to record them.
Because they are original, they thwart a dictionary attack like running
through the Oxford Book of English Verse.  My phrases are rather long
because of the redundancy of natural languages, so that I need length
to achieve an effective key length of say, 15-16 random characters.
But this does mean that I have to see what the hell I'm typing.  I can
recite my key phrases blindfolded, but I sure can't type them blindfolded.

Actually, I would like to see PGP and SFS extend their keyphrase ability
to handle several lines, so that I could compose couplets and quatrains.
I don't think we need 14 lines for sonnets yet :-)

Second, I would like to see PGP accept accented characters (alt-keypad
letters), to permit key phrase compositions in languages other than English.

I'll spare you all the thrill of reading the reviews here, but two
magazines have reviewed my book in their current issues:

	Wired, Apr 94
	Dr. Dobbs Journal, May 94

Both reviews are excellent, I am pleased to say.

Rumor has it that my book will also be reviewed in the June 94 Byte; I
have not seen the review or heard anything about it.  And there may also
be a review in IEEE Software later in the fall.

Bruce

   Thanks for the email, I've been informed there is no key exchange
   protocol in Clipper.  (Silly me, I assumed AT&T's secure telephones
   would require one.)  Can someone point me at some Capstone
   documentation that would show its protocol?  Thanks again.

I haven't seen the documentation on AT&T's Clipper-based telephones,
but obviously they require some sort of key exchange protocol.
It's not specified in Clipper, so pre-Capstone Clipperphones will all
have to roll their own or publish a standard and try to get people to
agree on it, depending on how concerned they are for interoperability.

AT&T's STU-III secure telephones do follow an NSA-specified key
exchange protocol; I think it's some variant on an authenticated
Diffie-Hellman, using the "Crypto Ignition Key" dongles for
authentication, plus a bunch of design and operations rules so that
you can specify a classification level for the conversation.

(Not sure what this has to do with clipper, BTW)

This is unlikely -- the whole point of public key encryption is
that the public key is *public*; _anyone_ can get your public key,
but it is computationally infeasable to derive your private
key from the public key (and any amount of traffic encrypted
with the public key).

Of course, we aren't sure that the proposed trap-door one-way
functions used by the existing PK cryptosystems are really
trap-door one-way functions, but best (public) evidence to date
suggests that they are...

Depends on the cryptosystem.  With one private and public RSA key, I
cannont crack any other key any easer than before.

The cracking of RSA-129 shows that 129-digit modulii are at the
edge of current technology of crackabilty.  It shows that you
need longer RSA keys if you want security.  If a general
polynomial-time means of factoring numbers were to be found,
and thus RSA rendered useless, it *still* wouldn't say anything
about the utility of one-way functions, it would just show that
RSA isn't one.

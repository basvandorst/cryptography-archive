Hopefully the organizers will compare RSA-129 with keys typically used
in public-key applications to quell the rumours that "RSA has been broken"
that will inevitably spring up, but here's a comparison.

129 digits is roughly 430 bits.  Thus, it is a graphic demonstration that
384-bit keys are indeed breakable, albeit with significant effort.
(This is why PGP calls them "casual security.")  512 bits is significantly
harder than has been attempted (what's the work multiplier for an extra 82
bits here?), and 1024 bits is still miles out of reach.

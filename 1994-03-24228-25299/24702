But please, please please.  Let me see the keyphrase as I type it in, so
that I can enter it correctly!  What!  Do you think crypto is only for
young folks who can type faultlessly?  Agism?  Ha! :-)

More seriously, keyphrases are not passwords, and password security is
not called for for keyphrases.  You should allow visible keyphrases as
an option.  Some folks will be working in an environment where they will
want to shield the keyphrase from their neighbors' eyes, as at work.
Others, such as this older person, uses crypto in the privacy of his
study, and my wife has never shown an interest in my computer activities.

For me, the risk of not being able to retrieve my data, or indeed, of
never being able to enter the keyphrase the same twice without seeing
it, and thus never getting my data encrypted in the first place, is
far greater than my wife accidentally seeing my keyphrase.

Remember too, the user of SFS may have to enter his keyphrase while 
under psychological stress.

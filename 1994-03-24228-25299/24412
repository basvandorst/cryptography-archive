This seems perfectly rational to me.  The law restricts exporting
of cryptos, not of textbooks.

The floppies that go along with this text book are not a
plausible part of a cryptosystem, but in general floppies
with crypto software on them might be.  So their export
is restricted.

I'm not saying it makes sense to retrict crypto exports, but
given that such restrictions exist, it is rational to
apply them to software that is on media as opposed to printouts.
The latter is *never* a compnent of a crypto.  The former
is in some instances.

I'm familiar with the NetCash paper by Medvinsky and Neuman, 1993,
from the ACM Conf. on Compu. and Comm. Security and the references
cited therein.

Are there other, perhaps more recent papers?

Are there proof-of-concept implementations?

I'm asking on behalf of a client who is interested in 
secure cash and other kinds of financial transactions
in an Internet environment.

Thanks.

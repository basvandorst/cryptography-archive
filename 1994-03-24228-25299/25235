I try not to be a pedant.  But I can't let this one go by.  In addition
to misspelling Sartre, he was not a communist.  The PCF wouldn't have him:-)
He opposed American foreign policy, he supported the PCF and the Soviet
Union, and I can see that our leaders would be sore at him, but he was
never a communist.

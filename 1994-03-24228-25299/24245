   I will prepare a description of the algorithm and have
   someone who has not seen RSA DSI's code reimplement it 
   in C.  (RSA's implementation is about 150 lines of C,
   so it shouldn't be too hard.)  Then we'll have a public
   domain implementation of a stronger-than-DES cipher
   designed by recognized experts.

Could you ask someone outside the US&Canada please?  The reason for this
request should be clear.

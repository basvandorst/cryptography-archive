   Sure, but that is all hypothetical.  In the real world, nobody
   has ever built a crypto that functions as you describe.  And
   nobody ever will.

Sorry, my mistake - scan, OCR, *compile*, and execute.  Works fine.
Alternatively, scan, OCR, interpret.  Works slower, but ok.

The issue is whether banning exporting the code on magnetic media
makes sense if you're allowed to export it painted on dead trees,
and I'd say it doesn't.

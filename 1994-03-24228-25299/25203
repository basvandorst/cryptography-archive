A friend asks me to post these questions about Clipper FIPS 185.

1.  What is the Family Key, and what is its purpose?  Does it separate
classes of users, or does it identify them?  Does the Family Key allow
traffic analysis?

In any case, if these aren't the right questions, what is the purpose of
the Family Key?

2.  As my friend reads the standard, it may not be possible to pre-encrypt
before input to Clipper.  The Cryptographic Protocol Field (CPF) suggests
to him that Clipper is a microprocessor, probably a programmed ROM.  Is he
right?	Does Clipper itself contain the codecs or a/d-d/a converters, or
are these latter devices auxiliary devices?

3.  He comments that the standard is so general it includes any
information transmitted over a telephone system as "data", but is there
one Clipper specifically adapted to voice and containing internal a/d, and
others accepting digital data directly?

4.  He assumes that digitally encrypted voice is transmitted in digital
form, and not converted back to analog for transmission.  Is he correct?
How would encrypted voice be transmitted with existing radio and telephone
systems for comparison?

I'll forward any comments to my friend, and I'd like to know too.

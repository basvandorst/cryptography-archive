  You are correct... the easiest way to prevent high-frequency
evesdropping is with a single throw double pole switch on the phone
line... just disconnect the whole thing when it's not in use.
However, this has the drawback that the phone won't ring from an
incoming call, either.  A filter is better.  Filter design isn't
quite as simple... you really need a full RLC device and the
rollover frequency wants to be around 3-4 KHz, and you need to do
it right where the line enters the building or at every single
phone on the line.  Still, it's within the level of stuff you can
buy at Radio Shack.  See "The Art of Electronics" for examples and
the math to specify the design.  Of course, if someone really wants
to hear what's going on in your place, there is little you can do
to prevent it unless you are willing to work in a basement without
windows.  Have to filter your line voltage (AC) as well if you are
using a computer... otherwise the signals leaking back through the
power supply can be read to reconstruct every key you push, every
disk seek and every line displayed.  Gets to be pretty expensive
rather quickly, so you really want to have something worth hiding.
I know this isn't crypto, but it answers the question.  Hope you'll
all forgive me for being a might off topic.

    Did Robert Fulton build the first steam powered ship?    No.
    Did Robert Fulton build the first successful steamship?  Yes.

    There were many predecessors of ENIAC.  However, ENIAC was the
first (programmable) computer that was a significant improvement over
punched card equipment.  There were hundreds of patents associated
with the ENIAC, some trivial, others like the half-adder, very
important.  (And a few, like stored programs, never patented.  Not
that it wasn't patentable, just that no one ever figured out who came
up with it.  With ENIACs design, it was obvious.  But the reasons for
making instructions and data the same size, and using interchangeable
stores for them was convenience and design reuse.  Stored programs
came after.

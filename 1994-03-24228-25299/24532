This is the first word on the encryption od Novell DOS that we have 
heard about. The only protection being offered is the scrambling of the 
partition record. (This makes the disk 'boot' protected) This can be 
bypassed by using, for example, NDD (Norton Disk Doctor from Symantec) 
as follows 'NDD C: /REBUILD <ENTER>' This would create the partition 
from scratch looking at the disk structure.

The other facility in protecting files is the password schema giving 
some discretionary access control (DAC). The problem with software 
protection not utelising proper encryption is open. The DAC can also be 
bypassed fairly easily.

The recommendation would be a proper risk analysis on the information 
flow and then take the appropriate action.

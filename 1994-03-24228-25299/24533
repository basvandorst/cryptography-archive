From a cryptographic point of view, a field is a ring such that it is too hard
to produce non-invertible non-zero values. For instance, if the factorization
of n is hard to compute, Z/nZ is a field! Moreover, if P(X) is a polynomial
whose factorization is hard to produce, (Z/nZ[X])/P(X) is a field to.

From a mathematical point of view, a field is a ring such that there is no
non-invertible non-zero values. This notion of field is not very interesting,
because it is generally too easy to compute square roots or some other
algebraic tools!

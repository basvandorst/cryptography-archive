1) I thought the whole world (or at least that portion which has used usenet
   for more than a couple of weeks) *already* knew that distribution headers
   function only as a voluntary selection criterion for limiting incoming
   traffic.

2) Even those usenet users who were not aware of the facts should have been
   able to figure it out after the original comments from people in the UK
   remarking that the USA distribution hadn't worked.

3) Do you *really* think that the feds would accept `I put USA in the
   distribution' as a valid excuse?  Are you a good enough actor that you
   could convince them that you *really* believed it worked that way?

4) Assuming you did believe that USA distribution would stop articles going
   outside the US, would you rather I'd stayed quiet and let you post away
   until the feds came and locked you up or would you rather I warned you
   before you found yourself up shit creek without a paddle?

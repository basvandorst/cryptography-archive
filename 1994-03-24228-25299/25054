Thanks to Mike Rosing for the pointer to Chapter 7 in Bruce Schneier's book.
It was an excellent and useful discussion of the issue of brute-force
cracking vs. key length.

I am now persuaded that 128 bit keys for commonly used secure cryptosystems
(IDEA, TDES, etc.) are robust. The ultimately persuasive calculation is in
Table 7.3 "Cost of a Brute-Force Cracking Machine". Bruce's calculations
take good advantage of assumptions about parallel processing, machine speed
and cost in various years, etc.

I'm a bit more conservative than Bruce, so the cells I looked at were the
cost to crack with year 2005 technology and 1 year to find solutions. I
think that's a pretty safe discount for the classified capabilities the
government may have today for cracking within, say 3 months.

Cutting to the chase, 64 bit keys aren't safe: $510,000 for the machine;
128 bit keys are: $9.4x10**24 for the machine.

As I understand it (please correct me if I'm wrong) both the RSA keys and
the IDEA keys are 128 bits or more in PGP; both the RSA keys and the TDES
keys 128 bits or more in RIPEM. Thus the acceptable encryption/decryption
times for users are met if one thinks PGP and RIPEM fast enough today.

I would have confidence in such systems, absent a classified breakthrough in
factoring for RSA, or some short-cut vulnerability we don't know about in
TDES or IDEA. I know of no such "holes".

Can anyone confirm my understanding of the key lengths in PGP and RIPEM?

Thanks;
David

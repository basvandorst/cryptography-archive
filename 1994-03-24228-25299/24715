Ok.  I've been lurking here for some time and I have a question.  Why
can't we use fractals for keys?  They're similar to each
other(self-similar), but not identical, and given a certain level of
accuracy chosen, it could be anywhere, since they have an infinite level
of recursion.  I'm certain there are problems here, but I just can't seem
to find them.  Anyone care to enlighten me?

Also, why can't we use the Uncertainty Principle for an RNG?  Just measure
something REALLY REALLY TINY and if the Least Significant Digit is odd
then assign it 0, if its even, assign it 1, and then construct a random
number bitwise.

Ben.

I think that it would be wise to run tests with uuencoded data of similar 
length before jumping to any conclusions.  You'll probably find that 
bans, if they exist, are against binaries in general rather than pgp 
messages specifically.  Lots of services have rules that tend to 
discourage people from transferring large binaries via email.

If uuencoded files make it though, just uuencode a pgp file and mail it.  
It would be more of a hassle, but if it works, it works.

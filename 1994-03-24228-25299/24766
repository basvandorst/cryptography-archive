        From pgpdoc2.doc:

     SHOWPASS - Echo Pass Phrase to User
     -----------------------------------
      
     Default setting:  SHOWPASS = off
      
     Normally, PGP does not let you see your pass phrase as you type it
     in.  This makes it harder for someone to look over your shoulder
     while you type and learn your pass phrase.  But some typing-impaired
     people have problems typing their pass phrase without seeing what
     they are typing, and they may be typing in the privacy of their own
     homes.  So they asked if PGP can be configured to let them see what
     they type when they type in their pass phrase.
      
     The configuration parameter SHOWPASS enables PGP to echo your typing 
     during pass phrase entry.

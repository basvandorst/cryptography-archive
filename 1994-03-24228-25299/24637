Subject: extending DES

So here's a suggestion that is probably naive. Please, feel free to 
tell me why it is stupid (and maybe I'll give it another try). I'm 
sending this out in the hope that I'll learn something.

Here is a simple proposal for extending DES to a 112 bit key which is 
also easy to implement based on the existing DES implementations 
(important for speed). 


1. Take two 56 bit keys K0 and K1. Generate the key schedules for these
   in the usual way (as with DES). 

In the case of encryption let
   KS[0] = encryption key schedule derived from K0
   KS[1] = encryption key schedule derived from K1

In the case of decryption let
   KS[0] = decryption key schedule derived from K1
   KS[1] = decryption key schedule derived from K0

(Basically, all I'm going to do is alternate using the first and
second key schedule to get a subkey for each round of DES, and
double the number of rounds to 32.)

2.
Now instead of the usual 16 rounds for DES, use 32 rounds.

For round i:
use the (i/2)-th subkey of KS[i%2] as the 48 bit subkey. 
(usual C-like notation)

if your key schedules are broken up into arrays of bits, 
i.e.defined as something like:
int KS[2][16][48]
this means we use the 48 bit subkey
KS[i%2][i/2]
for the ith round

I'd appreciate any comments?

Mark

   If that's true, why did Viacrypt have to get an IDEA license for its
   commercial PGP?

Probably because they're selling their PGP system instead of giving it
away free.  There are two issues for commercial use:
1) writing software that you're planning to sell
2) using software to exchange messages with commercial content.

From what I can tell, IDEA has said that it's ok to use free PGP
software for commercial speech (case 2), but not that case 1).

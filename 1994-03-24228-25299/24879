The best book I know of about the history of early electronic
computers is "The Computer from Pascal to von Neumann", by 
H. H. Goldstine.  It was written in the 1970's or so, and
I think the publisher is Princeton University Press.
(I haven't looked at it in a long time).  For some reason,
it was not mentioned in the otherwise very good article
that this follows up.

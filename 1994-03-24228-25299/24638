Help!  ;-)

As I mentioned earlier in the week, I'm writing a draft paper on the
security of Zip encryption.  I'd like your help in collecting material
that will corroborate my ideas.  I believe other people have previously
posted information on the security of Zip archives, (and their
'authentication').  I'd like information on any attacks that are more
sophisticated than guessing passwords, (either with a dictionary or
attacks like 'all possible alphabetic passwords less than 7 letters').


Thanks for your help.

Products with two factors seem to be a worst-case for factoring
algorithms.  Why do you think 3 would be stronger ?

Any problem in NP can be reduced to a system of nonlinear equations,
with a number of unknowns fixed for a given input size.  We could
solve factoring that way, but so far such methods are not competitive.

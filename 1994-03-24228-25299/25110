Don't be silly. If you own a bunch of Hemingway letters and try to 
publish without permission of the estate, you'll rue the day. Remember 
the fuss when a biographer of J.D. Salinger attempted to quote some 
correspondence in the possession of the Library of Congress and Columbia 
University. Salinger sued and most of the quotes were stripped from the 
manuscript when the court ruled the use went beyond "fair use."

Just because you have legal, physical possession of a manuscript does not 
give you the right to publish it. Extrapolating that into c-space is 
another matter, of course.

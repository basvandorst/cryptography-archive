: That's now true.  Until comparatively recently, it was feared that

: proved that DES is not a group.

If a block cipher is a group, then the encrypt-decrypt-encrypt
scheme (the Tuchman scheme) collapses to single encryption just
like encrypt-encrypt-encrypt.  Remember that every element of a
group has an inverse in the group, so for every key K there is
some K' such that encryption under K' is the same function as
decryption under K.

Thus the possibility that a block cipher is a group does not
suggest the Tuchman scheme is any more secure than
triple-encryption.

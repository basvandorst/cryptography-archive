Given: a brief text file.
1. Calculate its md5 hash.
2. Use this hash as a key for IDEA and encrypt the file.

Any security problems with this?

My intent is to make a pass phrase verification file, so I don't occasionally
goof when encrypting and lose data to a typo in the pass phrase.  (I hate 
typing it twice.)
I'll apply the above to my pass phrase once and save the result as a verifi-
cation file. Then when I want to encrypt, the program will hash what I type in 
and use that to decrypt the verification file.  If the result is the same as 
what I just typed in, I must have gotten it right.
However, I don't want to endanger my pass phrase.

Email or news responses much appreciated.

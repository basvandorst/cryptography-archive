   mail! God knows I wish it were usable, it'd make the product more
   sellable & and would really be a decent feature to be able to use
   too.

Unfortunately only the user interface to the encryption mechanism is
actually distributed to users.  The actual encryption code isn't, so
you can't just flip some dwrite and have mail encryption available.  To
actually enable the quite nice encryption facilities, you need a
special bundle which NeXT doesn't give to ordinary mortals like us.

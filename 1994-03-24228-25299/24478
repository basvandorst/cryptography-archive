An interesting solution to a similar problem is implemented by a
company named Kantronics.  Their product (called the KAM) allows a
priviledged user to remotely access special functions, and everyone
can watch both directions of the data flow, since it's accessed via
amateur radio (AX.25).  Their solution is to have the super-user enter
some text string from the console, such as "Dave is the greatest!"
Then, when I want to access it from work, it sends me some strings that
I have to answer correctly.  For example, it might send this:

7 1 12 4 6
3 9 1 20 3
18 13 9 12 10

These numbers refer to the seventh character ("s"), the first
character ("D"), the twelfth, etc. of the string entered from the
console.  The string itself never goes out over the air.  I can choose
to reply to any one of the three number strings that it sends out, and
anyone who is watching wouldn't know which one I'm responding to.  Of
course, this can be figured out if someone watches me access it over
and over, but by changing the string periodically, it would make it
pretty tough.

The advantage is that no calculator is required, even if the "7" key
only works half of the time :)

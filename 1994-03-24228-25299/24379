	Bad idea to be smug and superior without thinking it through. It depends on
	the complexity of the algorithm and thus the number of machine cycles to
	evaluate each test key. It also depends on whether any short cuts are
	possible with each algorithm.

	To take an obvious example, a 10 bit key with 20 transpositions in the
	decryption cycle will take longer to evaluate than an 11 bit key with 1
	transposition.

Just remember when evaluating DS's postings on key lengths, he has shown
himself to be woefully ignorant of the subject in the past:

If I had recalled this I wouldn't have asked the question.

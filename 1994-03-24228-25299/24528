	I have to admit that it confuses me sometimes, too.  For example,
the TI DSP applications data book  of 1991 (I think) has an app note
describing how to implement DES in real time for a ~48K bips data channel.
They even give the algorithm for DES, but not the source code for actually
doing it in a TMS32010 DSP chip.  That you must get from "your local TI
distributor", after first certifying that you are a US citizen, then paying
about $250.  Beats me...
	Regards,
	Mark

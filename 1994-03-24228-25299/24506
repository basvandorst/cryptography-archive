Actually (credit to whom it deserves) this method was first used in
the NET/ROM networking software for AX.25 (by WA8DED), but it sent
only a single challenge.  The proposal to send three challenges was
made by PE1HZG (Geert Jan de Groot) and implemented in the remote-command
access control in my version of the KA9Q package.
The Kantronics people have this program and have apparently taken
over this method into their own product (no objections to that).

Of course, the methode is not super-secure.  But it is good enough
for the purpose, and I have never seen it broken.  However, you should
use a longer string than in the example, and preferably not an
english sentence, but a random series of characters. (so that it is
not so easy to fill-in the gaps once you know some characters)

Summary: Is it possible to predict
Keywords: RNG Random Prediction
X-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.2 PL2]


Given a 'nonsecure' random number generator (best example being that 
in the standard C libraries), is it possible to predict the next number
in the sequence, after having any n outputs, WITHOUT knowing the algorithm?
Is there a general method for this?  

What is the value of n for this?  

Once this has been done, would it be possible, in a 16 bit range, to predict
the next value for any *one* value, with higher than a 1 in 4 possibility
of being right?

Does a data bit scream as its identity is torn away, as it becomes one with 
the masses?  Is the faint cry audible over the high whine of liquid data, 
flowing in a never ending stream?  Does it realize, in the fleeting whisps of 
nanoseconds left, its sole purpose was wasted in playing a forgotten game?

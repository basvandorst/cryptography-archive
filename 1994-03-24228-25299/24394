I am looking for the C code to doing large number addition and
subtraction.  Also I am looking for the code for making a large-prime
number generator.  If any one has any thoughts on where to look i.e. FTP
sites etc.  That would be great.  I am working on a group computer science
project to impliment RSA and DES encryption.  Please mail me as I don't
avidly read all the groups I am posting to.  -- Thanks AGAIN. :-)

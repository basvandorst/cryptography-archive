In math Class today, we were discussing RSA-129.
I'm wondering if there is a document explaining it that can be e-mailed to
me, as well as some info to how far you are into cracking it.
My address is: Jonathan_Ellenzweig@magic-bbs.corp.apple.com,Internet
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Thanx
Jonathan

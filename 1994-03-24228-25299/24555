There's an excellent new book by James Strayer called something like 
_Elementary Number Theory_. The publisher is PWS. It's a wonderfully 
clear introduction to the subject and even has a chapter on crypto 
applications (including RSA). If you need the precise title or an ISBN, 
email me and I'll look it up. The book is at home.

I have used all the PGP front ends that are out there.  There is 
only one front end - "pgp shell" i think its called - that is better than 
nothing (is DOS).  The windows shell that I most recently used was worse 
than the command line (which is not too difficult).  I would love it if 
you made a shell that was user friendly, take a look at the mac shell.  
Oh yeah, my major gripe with the mac shell is that you can't use your own 
command line arguments incase you want to use an esoteric command with 
it.  If you write it and make it FREEWARE, it will be used by a lot of folks.

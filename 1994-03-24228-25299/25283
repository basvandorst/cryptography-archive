I take it you mean you will vote 'no' on the CFV when/if it comes out.
If you are the admin of your site, or have any pull with him, I guess
you could have your site not carry it.  In any event, nobody's forcing
you to read the group, should it pass.

But please don't assume that will stop the rest of us from reading it;
read what you want, but don't tell me what I can/can't read.  Deal?

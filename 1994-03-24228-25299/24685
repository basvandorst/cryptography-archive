Does anyone know where I can get a current copy of the Defense Trade
Regulations?  I had a copy of ITAR and got a copy of the proposed changes
in 1992 which changed the name to DTR but I can't find it anywhere and I
can't remember where I got it.  I thought it was from NIST but have had no
luck finding it again.  Please respond via e-mail since the news has been
flakey lately.
 
Thanks

Nevertheless, to me this raises an undiscussed issue -- the care and feeding
of archived encrypted files.  I would like to see some serious thought
given to requirements of maintaining encrypted files over time.

As an employee of Fudge Motors, Inc., I'm the custodian of Fudge Motors
information (or subset) not the owner.  The owner is Fudge Motors.  As a
dutiful employee I keep some information in my custody encrypted.  Now
I leave Fudge Motors.  How does Fudge Motors retain access to its own
data?

I would like to see retention standards and mechanisms discussed with
respect to crypto.

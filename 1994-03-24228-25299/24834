 If a user is capable of memorizing random data, and memorizing
 wild capitalizations et al., I would assume that the key would be
 reasonably hard to break. If this passphrase was about 10-15 characters.

 One of the larger problems is the fact that most people cannot memorize
 random data. I change my passphrase very often. Every once in a while,
 though, I have to discard my new choice of passphrase because it has
 words in it. <shrug> I would assume that most other users have
 the same problems.

 How secure would be a 15 character random passphrase? I would work
 out the math, but, as some of you can probably tell, I'm not a
 mathematician. :)

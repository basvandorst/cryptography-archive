	As you know, to my dismay I am unable to export the source code
	to RIPEM/SIG.  However, the source is available to millions of
	citizens of the US and Canada.  If you get enough people from
	those countries to look at the source and declare it free of 
	trapdoors, there's a pretty good chance it's clean.  Any of those
	millions can build and export the executables of RIPEM/SIG, so you
	don't have to rely upon the copies that I built.

I don't understand.  Jim Bidzos announced on the 21st that Ripem/SIG
*is* now exportable.  I thought that since you wrote it, you'd know
about it.  Better drop him a line and check...

PS Isn't that announcement what prompted the subject line of this thread?

cjames according to his business card is Colin James the Third, apparently
a government employee for the Bureau of Land Management.  I suspect that
he represents himself.  I too received an ominous email from him claiming 
that a different cipher that I was discussing in an earlier thread was 
also covered by his patent.  The initiator of the thread, Peter Bosch, 
apparently was also contacted by Colin James the Third for alleged patent 
infringement.  The email was a partial enumeration of procedures of
suing folks for infringement, and how he would make them pay for it.

I asked for and received a copy of the patent from Colin James the Third,
which he graciously sent.  I don't understand his patent.  Apparently it 
is for a random number generator that looks to me like Knuth's, but the 
patent claims that James's generates numbers that are more random.

The effect of Colin James the Third's communications has been to kill
discussion of ciphers that may not be very strong but that I thought
are interesting.  At least it has been chilling upon me.

Does the law permit public discussion of patent details, because I would
like help understanding his patent?  I read it, but I just don't understand
how it covers the ciphers we have been discussing.

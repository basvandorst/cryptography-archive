I just heard the news earliar this evening that the FBI is trying to
get a tap into ALL phone lines.  The phone companies are fighting it tooth
and nail saying that the costs would have to be passed on to the comsumer
for such an expensive venture.  The FBI says that without such a system
their hands are pretty much tied and they are too slow to respond.

I can just see this system being abused, stocks/insider trading, all kinds
of fraud, blackmail, ohh and don't forget all you modem users all your stuff
is transmitted in plain ascii :-(  It wouldn't take but 2 seconds for all
the criminal organizations to get there people in key FBI positions.

Comments anyone?

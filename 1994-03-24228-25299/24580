I don't see the problem.  Why would there be specific literature?
It sounds like a 'straightforward' (lovely word ;-) implementation
problem.  Choose an algorithim, design a schematic or find a published
one, and enter it in the FPGA capture software - perhaps optimising
it to better suit the particular architecture, (eg functions that
take one cell for one architecture may require multiple cells for another).

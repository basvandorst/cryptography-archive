I'd say you've taken one step forward - you now realise that 128-bit IDEA
keys are secure from brute-force attack.  We still don't know if there are
any unsuspected weaknesses (but the same is true for DES, TDES, and even
Skipjack), and any cryptosystem is vulnerable to rubber-hose/fistful of
dollars techniques.

Now we have to convince you about RSA. :-)

Yep, 1024-bit RSA keys are starting to look a *little* vulnerable to really
rich three-letter agencies, although most assumptions seem to indicate that
they won't be vulnerable for several years yet.  OK, in 10 years it might take
the NSA a year or two (figures pulled from top of head - feel free to assume 3
months or 10 years or whatever) to crack one key and they would have to devote
all their resources to the task.  I can live with that - you don't need many
people using RSA to mean they have to be *very* selective as to who they go
after.

But just to put some figures on it, someone (don't remember who) estimated
that to get the same strength from RSA as IDEA you'd need a 3000-bit key.
Again, this is assuming no unsuspected weakness in the algorithm.

Now, with this new insight into the strength of IDEA, RSA and PGP, would
you care to re-evaluate your assumptions on the need for Clipper to protect
business interests and the *real* intentions behind it?  Unless I'm mistaken,
your supposition that PGP was weak was a key element of your support for
Clipper and the belief that the government was acting in the best interest of
its citizens.  If PGP is strong (it wouldn't be too painful to increase RSA
key-lengths a little if you're worried - the next release of PGP might well
support longer keys for the really paranoid with fast machines or plenty of
time) then a lot of your previous arguments about Clipper collapse.

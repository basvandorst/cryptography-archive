	You can't substantiate a negative! The only cryptosystem
I know of that you can prove secure is the OTP. But I was just
wondering if there was enough content in the clown's posting to
figure out what the thing likely is. Seems like it's using cipher
feedback to generate a "one time pad" (heh) and then doing some
superencryption on top of that. Nothing special, really.

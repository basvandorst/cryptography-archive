I have a question :

I realize that, when using PGP, one gives away public keys, but NEVER gives
away the file "secring.pgp"...

My question is this :

IF someone gets a hold of another's "secring.pgp" file, and attempts to
decrypt this other person's ciphertext with this stolen secret key, can
they do it without knowing the pass phrase?

What I am essentially asking is this : Does the pass phrase reside ANYWHERE
within "secring.pgp", or is the file "secring.pgp" itself encrypted, so
that even if someone steals someone elses secret key ring, they STILL
cannot get it to work...

Please tell me how secure "secring.pgp" is, and try to be as specific as
possible.

Thanks,

Michael Fischer

Just yesterday I went into a cellular phone distributor and retailer to
purchase a new cellular phone and and a new phone number.  I have had an
account with this outfit for several years, have paid all my bills in
timely fashion and have been generally a good citizen.  The application for
the account required my social security number, my driver's license number,
my work address, home address, work phone, home phone, a copy of my driver's
license and a few other odds and ends.  When I wanted to know why they 
needed all this data they told me that everyone required this information.
It may be too late for cryptographic defenses.  I refused and left without
a new telephone.  I think they won and everyone else lost.

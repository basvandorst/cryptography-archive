Bart Massey makes public allegations of wrongdoing on 3/16/94
on sci.crypt which I answer here, in part:


1.  US Patent No 5_251_165 was developed on my own time,
using my own resources, and independently of any work or 
resources at BLM.  

I do not use government resources when dealing with my 
patent or personal business.  (Others have already thought 
up and pursued that allegation, but it won't work.)


2.  Using Internet to "protect" a US patent is silly
because the appropriate place for that is in court.

At first sci.crypt was a tempting and convenient place 
to defend my patent from software implementations.  But
clearly an unmoderated forum such as sci.crypt is not 
appropriate even for that.  This is in part because 
detractors collectively require a higher degree of 
accountability of the detractee than they choose to 
observe between themselves.

I do not use Internet for commercial purposes because I 
do not distribute electronic copies of my patent or the
license by Internet.  However, many of those names on 
sci.crypt which detract me have in fact tried to get me 
to do just that.

Regarding nyx.cs.du.edu, the logon screen for all users 
states "Free Public Access to Internet".  Messages posted
from nyx also bear tedious disclaimers which are probably 
not necessary.

I assume you're talking about key servers for PGP?

Key servers aren't a tamper-secure distribution mechanism; they're mainly a
convenience, so you don't have to get everybody's keys from them directly.
(However, that *does* make spoofing more difficult, and anyone whose key 
is in there can request her key from the server to verify that it's
correct.

Security in PGP still comes from the Web of Trust of signatures on keys.
A key server that wanted to be secure could do so by insisting on
validating keys sent to it, and signing the keys it could verify,
but that's a lot of administrative work, and it's a much bigger win to
have a rapid convenient source of keys and letting the Web of Trust work.
Among other things, this means a keyserver run by Bad Guys doesn't
get any special trust, which is good.

There are a number of them out there, mainly operating by sending
automatic email replies.  The exact locations change a bit, since
university sites tend to get pressure from PKP's lawyers,
but there are gradually becoming a number outside the US or at
commercial sites in the US.  (One of them is wasabi.io.com ,
which supports finger as well as email.)  Most of them are named
	pgp-public-keys@site.domain   (e.g. io.com)
and will reply to a message saying "help" with instructions.
Many of them communicate with each other to share keys.

  Several other people have already pointed out that the time to encrypt
with RSA increases as the square of key size.  Thus, adding 180 bits to
a (relatively short) 512-bit key will increase encryption time by a factor
of ((512+180)/512)^2, which is approximately 1.8.  This is unlikely to put
anyone over "the limit", whatever "limit" you are talking about.

  Given that TDES and IDEA have survived public scrutiny, and have keys
long enough to resist any practical brute-force attack, this risk seems
somewhat remote.

   Yep, 1024-bit RSA keys are starting to look a *little* vulnerable to really
   rich three-letter agencies, although most assumptions seem to indicate that
   they won't be vulnerable for several years yet.  OK, in 10 years it might take
   the NSA a year or two (figures pulled from top of head - feel free to assume 3
   months or 10 years or whatever) to crack one key and they would have to devote
   all their resources to the task.  I can live with that - you don't need many
   people using RSA to mean they have to be *very* selective as to who they go
   after.

*If* factoring abilities increase at much the same rate as they have
over the last 25 years or so, kilobit keys should be safe for a while.
Bob Silverman recently posted figures which suggest that from 1970 to
1995, state of the art has increased from circa 45 digits to circa 145
digits.  These figures are for one year elapsed time to factorization.
A kilobit number is 308 digits and, at a rate of increase of 4 digits
per annum, will be crackable in one year by 2036.  I hope to be around
to see it happen.

This estimate should be used cautiously.  Although technological
improvements will probably continue doubling every year or two for a
long time to come, no-one really knows how algorithms will improve.
According to Silverman, the algorithmic improvements have been
responsible for about half of the increase in size of factorable
numbers.

   But just to put some figures on it, someone (don't remember who) estimated
   that to get the same strength from RSA as IDEA you'd need a 3000-bit key.
   Again, this is assuming no unsuspected weakness in the algorithm.

That was me, actually.  I seem to remember that my estimate was 3200
bits, +/- 200 bits, the slop to allow for foreseeable improvements in
either IDEA key search or optimizations of implementations of present
day algorithms.  Like you, I did not assume a magic factoring method
to be invented.

This is not true. It is far from the truth.

The Number Field Sieve factors an integer N in time

O( exp( (c + o(1)) (log N)^1/3 (log log N)^2/3) )

Suppose one is given an arbitrary, "average" large integer N.
Suppose further that one pulls out "small" factors by some "fast"
means and that what is left we do by NFS. Well, what is left is
at least as big as the product of the largest and second largest factor.
The expected size of the largest factor is about .7 log N, the
second largest is about .25 log N.

All that pulling out small factors by "fast" methods does is to reduce
N by a factor N^alpha for small alpha. Now plug N^(1-alpha) into
the above time estimate. All this does is to change the value of c.

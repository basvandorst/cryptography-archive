It is not clear what the patent covers, and I've been reading it attentively.
In the recap of prior art, there is no mention of Marsaglia, which means to
me that the search of prior art must have been incomplete.

I comment further on this patent in thread "secure RNG", where I invite
Colin James III to explain where my interpretations of his patent might
be in error.

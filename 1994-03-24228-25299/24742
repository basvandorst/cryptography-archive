In article <9403160551.AA02871@nyx10.cs.du.edu>,
Colin James III (The Rt Rev'd) <cjames@nyx10.cs.du.edu>
once again comments on a US Patent he claims ownership to.
I have some questions for the net, as Mr. James has made it
fairly clear that he is not interested in receiving personal
e-mail.

1) I note that he lists his primary address as
cjames@dsc.blm.gov , which is presumably (although internic
doesn't seem to have much info on it) a site within the United
States Bureau of Land Management.  As I understand the law, if
Mr. James is an employee of the BLM, doing software-related
work, any software patents he develops will become public
property.  Am I mistaken?  (If Mr. James is not a BLM employee,
of course the question of his use of BLM services immediately
arises.)

2) Don't Mr. James' attempts to protect his patent in this
forum come dangerously close to use of Usenet news for
commercial purposes?  It's not clear to me how this use is in
accordance with the "fair use" guidelines...  Along the same
lines, does the University of Denver allow the use of their
machine nyx.cs.du.edu for this purpose?

Just thought I'd ask...

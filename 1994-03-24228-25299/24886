If you want to, Jeff, I have a second-hand ESL tempest receiver that I'd be
delighted to sell you. It was used in a project to design a commercial tempest 
PC, which we completed; no-one was interested (I could sell you the prototype of 
that too if you want). No-one's been interested in buying the receiver either. 

From the commercial point of view, tempest is a dead loss: its only (marginal)
use is in marketing support (impressing the more naive kind of consultancy 
prospect and getting an occasional morsel of press publicity).

I strongly suspect that the millions spent on tempest by NATO governments have
just been a bonanza for a few favoured suppliers. After all, (1) all material 
relating to tempest remains classified (2) it's classified at low levels 
(restricted and confidential) which essentially mean that the information is kept 
from parliament and the press but not from serious players such as the Russians 
and the Chinese. 

I conclude that the real tempest threat to the NATO military does not come from a 
man in a van, but from the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee (and its 
counterparts overseas),

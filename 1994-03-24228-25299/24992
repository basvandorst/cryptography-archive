As far as I'm concerned David Sternlight can post all he wants. I
thank him for taking the time to be so involved in these issues.
Though I do not necessarily agree with his views, I welcome his
input and consider it a valuable counter point to the general
back-slapping among the converted. And, yes he does get a bit
cranky from time to time, but considering the flames that he
attracts, which I feel are generally out of proportion to
whatever instigated them, I feel he is rather circumspect in
his response.

It is much more disturbing to me to read posts such as yours
trying to silence an opposing viewpoint. If your opinions,
or the opinions you support cannot tolerate dissent, then you
should take a very hard look at them for they are suspect.

Silencing the opposition, nor encouraging others to assist you,
are not acceptable tactics in any forum where freedom and
truth have any value - Usenet is not yet (I think) a police
state.

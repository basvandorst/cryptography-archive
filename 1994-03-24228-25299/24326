Jim,

I just recently downloaded PGP for DOS.  I can't seem to find the host 
where I downloaded from but I know that nic.funet.fi has it on a 
directory that is available at certain times of the day. I didn't use 
that source however. If no one answers you then I can ftp it to you if 
your site always it. 

One host you can try is csn.org. There is a directory starting with the 
name "mkj" or something like that. You cd to that dir and read the README 
file. This contains information about which directory to cd to (which is 
NOT visible to the user) to get the PGP and other encryption software.

A closer reading of the patent leaves the questions unanswered.  The claim
of limited time strikes me as quite specious given the heavy-handed legal
threats that were laid down.  

The patent is written in a very obtuse, difficult to follow manner.  This
may be a very deliberate strategy on the part of Mr. James' patent
attorney or it may just follow from the writing style of the documents
that Mr. James gave to his patent attorney and from which the patent
description was written.  

Given that people have taken the time to explain the detailed workings of
their programs to Mr. James, it would be polite for him to return the
courtesy and answer a few well-reasoned and thoughtful questions regarding
his patent that would help other people to avoid infringing on Mr. James'
patent in the future.  Remember, no one told Mr. James "F___ you, you can
defend you patent in front of a federal judge". He, however, feels the
right to in effect say that to readers on sci.crypt.

However, Mr. James' patent contains claims which "read onto" the prior art
in Alogrithm M as published in Knuth's book Semi-numerical Algorithms.
Specificly, claim #4 and its rather oddly rewritten equivalent, claim 8.

     Claim 4: An apparatus for generating a series of random numbers
     comprised of:
          first means for generating a series of intermediate random
               numbers,
          an intermediate register receiving each said random number from
               said first generating means,
          second means for generating a series of final random numbers,
                    each final number corresponding to an intermediate
                         random number stored in said intermediate
                         register, and
          the generation of each final random number utilizing the
               corresponding intermediate random number and a history of
               preceding random numbers.

Nowhere in Mr. James' patent does he distinguish this claim from the prior
art.  I would surmise that this claim would not stand up to the serious
scrutiny of an infringement action or even a patent reexamination. He also
claims there are no references to two-phase random number generators in
the prior art referenced in Knuth, despite the existence of the
aforementioned Algorithm M which this claim "read onto" directly.  If Mr.
James were to be a patent infringement suit I believe that it would
appropriate to raise, among other defenses, that there had been a fraud
committed on the Patent Office. That the examiner missed it is just one of
those things that happens.


This claim apparently forms the broad basis for Mr. James' attacks as
"patent infringement" on everything that he does not take the time to read
and understand. He has jumped all over people with threats of high cost
legal action for alleged infringement (including cc's to their employers)
without bothering to read and comprehend the code under discussion. 

He also seems to be totally unaware of the except made in the patent law
that explicitly allows for experimental use and that explicitly declares
such use to be noninfringing.

*Only* after the code is carefully explained to him in words of about one
syllable do he say (in the immortal words of Mrs. Emily Latella) "Oh,
that's different. Never mind".  As an example, I attach the following
posting:

     >|> at its ugliest.

Mr. James does not seem to be able to say "I misunderstood. I withdraw my
statements about infringement. I apologize for the threats that I made. I
will send a letter to your employer whom I cc'ed so stating, etc." All he
seems to be able to do is add a snide comment about what he considers to
be unesthetic coding styles.  The man exhibits the manners of a barnyard
boor.

Unfortunately the way the Mr. James deals with writers with whom he no
longer wishes to correspond with is to make a legal demand that the "cease
and desist" from contacting him further.  Apparently anyone who questions
Mr. James' purported wisdom or who requests supporting detail from Mr.
James in support of Mr. James' technical claims is considered ill-
mannered.

Mr. James imputes motives to readers of sci.crypt that are both factually
incorrect and made without foundation.  I requested a copy of his patent
from him because I was sincerely interested in understanding the scope and
import of the technology that he had invented.  After spending a
reasonable, but substantial, amount of time to carefully read and
understand his patent, I asked him questions about information which would
support his claims of "greater randomness" and claims of cryptographic
suitability. When his answer was non-responsive other than to say, in
effect, "Yes, I have proofs", I said so in a followup letter. I also said
that by the time of the followup letter I had cryptanalyzed his product,
had found a polynomial time attack that showed that his invention was very
cryptographically weak and that I was no longer interested in his
invention.

This is apparently considered by Mr. James to be "arguing without being
polite". It is also apparently caused Mr. James to consider me "ill-
mannered writer" because his response was to demand that I not longer
contact him via E-mail.  When I followed up with a letter saying that I
would accede to his request as long as he ceased threatening people on
sci.crypt, his response was to notify me that he had discarded my E-mail
unread and that i was to "cease and desist" from contacting him.

These two letters are the basis for Mr. James statement in Message-ID:
<9403160551.AA02871@nyx10.cs.du.edu>  that is sent him "prodigious private
email". I would be very interested to know what dictionary Mr. James uses,
because clearly we does not appear to be using a common vocabulary based
on Standard American English.

At no time did I attack him personally as "paranoid". My statement was
"His response was ... suspicious almost to the point of paranoia." 

I do believe, based on this and other examples, that Mr. Colin James
should avail himself of a good junior college or high school extension
course on English Reading Comprehension.  I believe that he could greatly
benefit from such a course.

This response will truly be nit-picking, but on a strictly factual basis
Mr. James has no basis for his claim beyond my unequivocal statement that
I am a layman with respect to the law.  I have never made any statements
as to my skills, qualifications or standing as a physician or a priest. 
If Mr. James can supply any factual basis for his claim, I request that he
withdraw it forthwith.  I find his "McCarthy-esk" tactics of making
unfounded claims and accusations repugnant and destructive to the norm of
free expression on the Internet.

Again, what dictionary are you using? When did 2 E-mail letters become
"prodigious"?

>Robertson when I realized he was not serious about his

I dispute that I was not serious in my inquiries.  My interest waned
significantly when I read his proposed license terms in light of the not
very significant (to my mind) capabilities of his invention, but this did
not detract from the seriousness of my initial query and first round of
followup questions.  I lost interest after I uncovered to cryptographic
weaknesses in Mr. James invention that made it unsuitable for serious
cryptography.

I never realized that only hobbyists used routines written in C and C++.
I guess that the entire commercial and private Unix community along with
such minor industries forces like Microsoft, IBM, .... have just been
reduced to "hobbyist" status.  In a more serious vein, I find it nearly
impossible these days to get a serious, commercial quality system-level
component or subsystem that is *not* written in either C or C++, mainly
because those languages provide the greatest level of hardware and
operating system independence of any development environment currently in
wide use.  While I may have philosophical disagreements about the wisdom
of implementing large scale applications systems in C (which is a totally
different discussion),  I do not dispute the demonstrated value of
implementing *system* level components in C (or C++ for object oriented
environments).

On the other hand, Mr. James says that as part of his licensing he
provides fully documented source code in Ada-83, TrueBASIC, FORTH-83, and
FORTRAN-77.  I would question the general applicability of any of his
choices and would also assign "hobbyist" status to use of Forth and
TrueBasic.  I would question the relevance of and Ada implementation
outside of a few large government military contractors and would question
the value of Fortran outside of hard-core Engineering and Physical Science
data analysis applications.

I leave it to the general computing community to answer the question of
the "hobbyist" nature of C implementations.

I had requested that Mr. James apologize for his threats to individual
participants on sci.crypt.  This he *refuses* to do!  This despite
acknowledging individual instances where he made threats that he modified
into statements of non-interest once the threatened party led Mr. James by
the hand through a simplified explanation of the program under question. 
At no time did Mr. James make any apology for his earlier actions.

I repeat my demand that Mr. Colin James apologize both to the individuals
involved, any of their employers that he may have contacted and to the
sci.crypt generally for his inappropriate and inexcusable conduct.

I am also very curious to know who my "cronies" are on sci.crypt.  The
only person who posts here with whom I have ever even corresponded has
taken no part in any of the discussion on this or related threads.  Again
I must ask Mr. James just exactly what dictionary he uses for his
definitions of words because it is very difficult to understand and
communicate with some who is not speaking the same language or who uses
different meanings for words than are assigned by the most common
dictionaries.

Unfortunately Mr. Colin James did not just notify them of a possible
patent infringement and request that they cease infringing.  He also made
heavy veiled threats of how much monetary damage he would cause them by
suing them and apparently proceeded to also notify these persons'
employers.  At no time did he offer any explanation of what way or manner
these methods infringed his patents or what specific claim they infringed.

Mr. James also seems to be totally unaware that the Patent Law provides
for experimental use of patents and that such use does not infringe.  (see
my earlier posting for the 35 USCA case law citations)

When people patiently went out of their way to explain to Mr. James how
their programs worked, Mr. James expressed that he had no interest in nor
concerns with their programs.  At *no* time has Mr. James apologized for
or retracted his inappropriate blustering about infringement law suits nor
has he written to the various employers who he contacted to let them know
that they should have no further concerns regarding this matter. To me,
the man shows an ill-mannered disregard for the normal conventions for
civil discourse in this society and could use some resocialization.

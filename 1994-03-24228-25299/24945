Mark Brader's chronology of the early computers has a serious omission.
In May 1950 the SEAC Computer at the US National Bureau of Standards did its
first computation (optical ray tracing) and it was officially dedicated on
June 20, 1950.  SEAC had 1200 vacuum tubes, 512 words of 45 bits of mercury
delay line memory, internally stored program, both a 4-address and a
3-address instruction format, and 12,000 germanium diodes for switching.  It
was built by a group that had the responsibility to purchase the first
commercial computer for the US Government and that built SEAC when it became
clear that the contractor could not deliver in time.  SEAC had a long
history of illustrious computations and was the primary vehicle for
originating such fields as linear programming, image processing, and
chemical structure searching as well as introducing the computer into the US
Government.

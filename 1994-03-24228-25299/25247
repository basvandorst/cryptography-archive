  In one of the recent sci. Americans I read that one of the early
versions of public key encryption had been broken... Given PGP is more
advanced, but is it secure?  Can someone relay stats on the time
necessary to crack PGP(2.3A) with key lengths of casual (256)
commercial (512) and military (1024)

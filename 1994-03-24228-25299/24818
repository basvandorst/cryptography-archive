No.  Of course, performance never hurts.

Given that, if you consider IDEA to have 17 half-rounds (it's of the
form ABABABABABABABABA, where there are 9 A's and 8 B's), the best
attack I know of penetrates 2.5 rounds, ABABA before becoming as hard
as brute-force search, I've recommended 4-round IDEA (ABABABABA) for
less security-concious applications.  (E.g. a secure cordless phone.)

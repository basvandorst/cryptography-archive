No, they only receive money when Word is legally *purchased*.  Not when
it is *used*.

Once I have paid a one-time fee for Word, I can use it to write letters and
make fifty billion pounds without paying Microsoft another penny.

Similarly, once I have paid a one-time fee for IDEA, I can use it to
encrypt my mail and make fifty billion pounds without paying
Ascom-Tech another Swiss Franc.

Microsoft have taken the one-off development cost of Word and spread it
over N purchasers, regardless of how much those purchasers use the
package or what they use it for.  They spread it as a one-off fee those
purchasers pay in order to get a legal copy of Word.

Similarly, ViaCrypt have taken the one-off licensing fee for IDEA and
spread it over N purchasers of their product, regardless of how much
those purchasers use PGP or what they use it for.  The cost is spread
as a one-off fee purchasers pay to get their legal copy of PGP.

Effectively, the patent is diverting a percentage of the fixed
development cost from ViaCrypt to Ascom Tech.  That's all.

There are people who get much more value out of Word than I
do, because I hardly use any of the features.  But those people pay exactly 
the same.

To a corporate user, Word may be of vital commercial value, and its
loss might cost him thousands of pounds; to some guy sitting at home,
Word may be of no commercial value, and its loss would cost him
nothing.  But both those users pay the exact same fee to Microsoft.

Unless, that is, you define "value given" to be the amount of money
paid, in which case your statement is a vacuous tautology.

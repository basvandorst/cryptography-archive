Do I understand you correctly?  You are telling people that some friend of
yours plan to break the law and you are soliciting advice on how to cover
up the act.  I don't think a lot of people want to openly give you advice
here.  And for the legal experts out there, does that amount to conspiracy?

Seriously, have your friend thought about marketing his product without
breaking the law?  I suppose by "break a couple of copyright laws", you
meant infringing the copyrights of other people.  If that's the case, I
guess negotiating a license from the copyright owners would be a good start.

Well, it seems I spoke too soon and should have read beyond the pointer to
Chapter 7 of Schneier's book. It seems the action on weakness is with RSA,
not IDEA or TDES, because of factoring attacks.

Apple's AOCE is hard-wired to 512bit RSA keys. That's not secure against
rich cryptologic organizations. If one specifies 1024 bit keys in RIPEM or
PGP one is better off.

Schneier discusses this in two places. In Chapter 9, p. 212 he says that
in 1980, factoring 82 DIGIT hard numbers took a few hours of work on a Cray,
and of course it's now 1994. He also says a $25,000 (special purpose)
machine can factor 100 digit numbers in two weeks.; $10 million to factor
150 digits in a year (all based on unclassified technology).

Apple's AOCE uses 154 digit (512 bit) numbers, and it's one of the options
in PGP and RIPEM.

For just about the longest keys routinely available, 1024 bits, he says:
"At a European Institute for System Security workshop, the participants
agreed that a 1024 bit modulus should be sufficient for long-term secrets
for the next 10 years." This was published by Springer Verlag in 1992 so it
probably represents unclassified state-of-the-art in 1991. "However, some
speakers warned: 'Although the participants of this workshop feel best
qualified in their respective areas, this statement should be taken with
caution.'"

So I'm back where I was, but with respect to the RSA keys used in PGP,
Ripem, etc. rather than the individual message keys using IDEA and TDES:
with the possible exception of the longest keys, there's at least some
reason to speculate that rich, smart cryptologic organizations can break
such publicly available systems as PGP and RIPEM for cases worth putting the
resources to. Of course this is even better for such cryptologic
organizations, since once they've broken the private RSA key they can read
all traffic, past and future using that key-pair.

I'm just experimenting with the MD5 routines in RSAREF and I'm trying
to check and make sure my program isn't mangling data before going
through the MD5 routines themselves.  Is there anywhere I can find
some kind of reference, i.e. this_value hashes to that_value?
Preferably on-line of course :)

I thought I'd try extracting a key (in binary of course) and then
checking the PGP fingerprint against my program's hash of the key
file.  They didn't match .. :)

Does anyone know if the data contained in an extracted key file is
*identical* to the data used to construct a PGP key fingerprint?

Thanks muchly... ttul

     In days gone past as a humble graduate student I would peruse 
     sci.crypt as an aid to my studies of protocols, algorithms, and 
     algebra pertaining to cryptography and hardware based security.

     Now as a full-time working stiff/ part-time grad student there is
      no longer the time to sift thru all the redundant 
      political/mine_is_better_'n_yours/PGP_PGP_PGP_PGP/I'll_sue_you posts
      
    I want a scientific newsgroup  (as it was many many netyears ago)
       in addition to what is in existence currently.
    
    ANYBODY else InTeReStEd in initiating the procedure to create a
     *new* moderated group dedicated to the transmission of knowledge, NOT
            flames...

    I remember once upon a time several people volunteered to be moderators
       (Mr Silverman, et al)

    I would prefer a  newsgroup rather than a mailing list
     (tho I'm very happy to receive the NMBRTHRY list ;-)

   C++ya,
     Tom

I have a problem, and I'm sure someone on the net has a solution.

Almost two years ago I typed some letters on my computer at work;
because of the nature of these letters, I used the password feature in
WordPerfect 5.0 to protect them from casual snoopers.

Now I have an urgent need to get copies of those letters, but I can't
remember the password.  I know this code can't be that hard to break,
but I have no idea how to go about it.  Can anyone help?

Thanks in advance.

      I saw it mentioned in Wired magazine (the most recent one)
Unfortunately, it was only available for the Mac at the time (flamebait?),
but they said that a port was being worked on for DOS.  It works like
this: 

      A .GIF has 8 bits/pixel.  If you change one of those to a data bit, 
you drop down to 128 possible colors, but you can hide a message in an 
ordinary looking picture.  It could also concievably be done with a 16 or 
24 bit picture.

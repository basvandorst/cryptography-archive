Not so, IMO.

There are several types of hook-switch defeat, of which the infinity bug is
rather more one family than one specimen. Some require prior access to the 
target's phone or at least the target's room, others require no prior access.

Hook switch defeats can be satisfactorily implemented on modern PSTN but not 
with all handsets. Some require the eavesdropper to be positioned between the 
local exchange and the extension. Others will operate internationally if there
is STD. For a quite a while, it was only possible to use these devices on a DEL
but, for those that have DDI, the risk is now increased.

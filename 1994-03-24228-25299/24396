	Yup.  I bought it, too.  I concur, it's good stuff.  BTWdisks of
source in the book are available from the author, a regular participant
here.  Reach him at "schneier@chinet.com".
	A list of corrections to the book are also available in postings
here (a couple of weeks old) and from ftp somewhere.  I will also agree
with previous postings that it is commendable that the author acknowledges
and corrects his mistakes right up front.  Thanks, Bruce.
	Uh, of course, to buy the disks, you should be a US citizen.  Export
controls, you understand...

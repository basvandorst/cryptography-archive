I am afraid I have to point out that this is already possible to do, and in
fact has been done in the past by the Dutch police. In 1992 and before
there was a relatively large number of people whose phones were being
(legally) tapped, who "inadvertently left the phone off-hook", so that the
so-called law enforcers could overhear conversations in the room where the
telephone was.

What really happened in at least some of these cases was that the police
were actively eavesdropping by sending high-frequency currents over the
phone line, thereby turning the hook switch into a capacitor, allowing
the alternating current to be modulated by the microphone.

The use of this technique was uncovered in a court case in the summer of
1992, of which I unfortunately have no information.

For technical information, including a schematic of a device demonstrating
the principles, I refer to Billsf's article (in Dutch) in Hack-Tic 18-19
(1992). Perhaps Billsf can be reached as billsf@xs4all.hacktic.nl and
may be willing to provide information in English.

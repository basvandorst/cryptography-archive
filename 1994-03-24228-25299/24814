No -- not yet.

It's better to have (n*8) divide the TRAN block size evenly.  That way, any
given byte out of the TRAN has an exactly even probability to have come
from one of the n different keys.  By minimizing the a priori information
about these keys, the enemy is forced to attack all n keys in parallel.  He
can't identify one to single it out for first attack.

Other than that, the more keys the better.  Of course, at some point, the
amount of key material exceeds the normal message size, so from that point
of view, the less the better.


I have no clue whether this gives any better than n*X complexity for
attack.  With luck, it gives X^n complexity.  I'm in the middle of studying
this -- don't know if I'll have an answer soon, but I'm plugging away at
it.  For now, don't count on any more than n*X steps to break nDES (where X
steps break DES).

You pays your money and you takes ....

Enjoy,

Carl

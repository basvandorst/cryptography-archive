Hello, everyone.

Well, I read the FAQ and this doesn't appear to be on it, so here goes:

I was wondering if people out there might be able to give me methods for
simple (most important) and reasonably quick (next most important)
reasonably secure (least important) encryption of text, preferably
without first translating the text into numbers.  The most obvious
method, I think, is letter substitution, sometimes with multiple letters
substituted.  I was wondering if there is anything else more secure and
as simple.

Thanks.  Email would be nice, but I'll try to read this group for
replies.

Yours, Craig.

It's moot whether he claims it or not.  We have established that we can
discuss what we please regardless of valid or invalid patent claims.

Me, I'm going back to an earlier thread.  John Kelsey grabbed my

crypto.  It is precisely these sorts of weaknesses that I want to
understand.  The rng was one that caused James to squawk.

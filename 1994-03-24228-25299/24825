I think you'll do everybody in this group a service if you could ask your
corporate lawyer friend for references to relevant cases and sections of
the law.

I am no expert, but allowing the recipient to claim ownership of any
"intellectual property" in the correspondence he/she receives just doesn't
sound right to me.  What happens if the sender doesn't own the copyright?
Say, if somebody send me newspaper clippings, do I suddenly become the
copyright owner of the newspaper articles?  Or, if in an intellectual
discussion, I include excerpts of my unpublished manuscript in a
correspondence to another person, does that person suddenly have the
right to publish my manuscript?  

I have no problem if the recipient of my correspondences claim ownership
of the paper on which the correspondences are printed.  Losing the copyright
to my writings just because I sent it to a person to let him take a look,
no way!

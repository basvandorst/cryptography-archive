I've seen on TV that it is not necessary for the phone to be off hook for
eavesdropping to be possible.  I think it should be a simple modification
to the phone to disconnect the entire handset when the hook is depressed,
although I don't know exactly how it can be done.  Maybe, as an alternative,
one can build a bandpass filter to foil such eavesdropping attempt.

Will the EE's out there share their expertise with the rest of us?

ANSI's X3.[...can't quite remember...] that lays out DES is, I have
been told, different from the DES routines that are used by UNIX and
the like.

What I'm looking for is an example of code that impliments the ANSI
standard. Will libdes or ufc do this? Or, do I need to look elsewhere?

If anyone can mail me code snippits, I would be VERY appreciative.

        Noting that he was in Australia, what was it that led you to
        suspect that he was expecting anything to be sent from the
        United States?  There are other countries on the Net, you
        know :-)

        As it happens, and if he took the trouble to look, there are
        probably half a dozen different implementations of DES, in
        source, on the six nearest BBS sites to his home...

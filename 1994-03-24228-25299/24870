 Makes me wonder how secure having an 'index' file is. An index file
 that has the filenames, data inside said files, and the passphrases?
 It would seem to me that if the key to the index file is
 very strong, it would be impossible to break it. Seperate key pair,
 seperate passphrases.

 I did that with some SECUREDRIVE floppies. I wonder how secure this
 'index' technique is?

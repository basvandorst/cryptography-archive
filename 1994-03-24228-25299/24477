It seems to me that "not a theory, because they said so" is an appropriate  
response to the question that Mr. Smith asked.  If the government stated  
that to be their purpose, then there is no need to theorize or speculate  
if that is one of their purposes.

Making light of every statement that David Sternlight makes, on the other  
hand, seems to serve no purpose other than to service some infantile  
obsession that many on this group seem to share.  That being "If it  
doesn't agree 100% with everything I believe then it has no merit and is  
worthy only of contempt."  The truely frightening aspect of this attitude  
is that many of the people who seem to have it are among our countries  
most educated.  It doesn't bode well for the future.

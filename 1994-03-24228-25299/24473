Hey, is it OK for a US citizen to log onto a site into the UK and run
PGP there to encrypt a message to another US citizen?  If so, is the law
an ass, or what?

Is it OK to print C source of, say, PGP in an OCR-friendly form, and
export it with a program on floppy that's especially good at reading
that OCR-friendly text?  If so, is the law an ass, or what?

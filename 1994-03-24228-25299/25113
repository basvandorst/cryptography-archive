Could I put in a user request for PGP to translate key characters from
whatever platform to a common code page?  

I agree it is a problem if you can't input an accented character on another
system (like Unix with a VT100 terminal).  For DES implementations, the
equivalent hex key is echoed to the user, and the hex key can be accepted
in lieu of the character key phrase.  Is something like that possible for
PGP?

3rd.  With the MS DOS version of PGP, I did try to enter sharp accent e
with alt-130.  It didn't seem to work.  Is there another way I can
enter accented PC characters?

I haven't been following this thread closely, I beg pardon in
advance if this is previously discussed:

If MD5 or some other hash function were progressive, then we could
use it in sort of a "Chain block cypher" mode where the current
hash is the hash of the key and all the blocks of plain text up to
this point, and the cypher text is xor of the current hash and
the plain text block.

This seems to me to have all the advantages of a PRNG one-time-pad
approach, and maybe none of the disadvantages of the PRNG being
so predictable.

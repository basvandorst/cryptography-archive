PGP currently supports 1280 bit keys.  RIPEM uses RSAREF, which
supports keys no longer than 1024 bits.  RSAREF's license doesn't
permit changing such parameters without special permission, the way I
read it.  You can set PGP's max key length to pretty much anything you
want (if you have the source) without changing your legal situation
with regards to using it.

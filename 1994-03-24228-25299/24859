Why not just use an FTP-by-email server?  Many of the public domain info
files circulating on the net, such as the "Yanoff" file and "Hitchhiker's
Guide to the Internet", explain how.  PGP is a pretty large program, and
making a request like you have done could result in multiple copies showing
up, filling your mailbox and running up you monthly bill.

If you need info on using FTP by mail, send me private e-mail and I'll
explain.  Maybe some brief instruction should be put in the FAQ for this
newsgroup.

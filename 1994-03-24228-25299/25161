Is this a simple kind of blob commitment? If so, I offer the following
varient, which uses off-the-net software:

Alice wishes to post messages and be able to cancel them later. She
generates a random & unique character string [S] for each message [M]. When
posting, she appends the string to the message [M+S] and hashes the result
[ H(M+S) ]. She posts the original message and appends the hash [M+H(M+S)]
and keeps the string secret.

To cancel the message, she reveals S.

I too, am ignorant of the nuances of incryption.  Doesn't the argument of 
decryption revolve around concept of being able to tell when you have 
attained proper decryption?  If text file A is encrypted to file EA, then this
is further encrypted to EEA, then the first layer is cracked,  so the 
'decrypters' now have EA; How will they tell that they have succesfuly 
obtained EA?  Isn't it still just a jumble?  What will tell them they are
on the right track or that they should next try other (and incorrect) 
schemes?

Hi there.

I'm a c programmer with tons of mathematical background.  I started
writing some code to decrypt single substitution ciphers (don't laugh)
simply for some programming excersize.

I realized that it would be a nice challange to write something that
will crack any s.sub cipher given enough cipher text and given that the
plain text is actually written in real English words that can be looked
up in a dictionary.

I have some (very little) experience; I used to crack s.sub messages
that were in puzzle books or the newspapers.  However, I lack knowledge
of an orderly directed approach.  I remember using some letter freq
charts, some diphthong freq charts, common 1st and last letter charts,
etc, but there is probably a method to cracking these things that is
well suited to a program.

I'd be greatful to anyone who would want to correspond with me on this;
give me the "ins-and-outs", efficiency tips, etc.

My goal is to write something that would crack anything and everything
encrypted with s.sub, or at least give options for possible solutions if
there's not enough to go on; (via pattern matching with a dictionary).
I promise that anything I write will be public domain and given to
everyone who wants it on the net.

After that, maybe I'll try writing something that decrypts a harder
encryption method...

thanks,
 -peter

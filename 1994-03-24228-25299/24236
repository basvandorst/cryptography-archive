   MNP5 or v.42 compression anyhow.

Actually, it may help somewhat, if the extra delay jitter isn't too long.
While the encrypted data isn't compressed any further, the MNP/V.42
can let you eliminate the start/stop bits, saving about 20%.
A year ago, this looked critical, since you can't quite fit
13.3 kbps GSM sound into 14.4 kbps with start&stop bits
(I didn't have two of the modems to play with to test it :-);
this is no longer a problem with 28.8 kbps modems,
except for noisy circuits where you can't get that much performance
(most likely a problem for international calls wehre you'd like the privacy.)

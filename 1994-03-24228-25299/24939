  Since the time required to use a key and the time required to generate a
key increase polynomially (no worse than the square of key length, I
believe), this is not a particularly significant constraint.  Given that
an increase in "long" key length from 1024 bits to 2048 bits requires
the user to increase his computing power or his patience by a factor of
four, but imposes a similar factor of at least 10^10 on would-be crackers
(the most optimistic estimates of factoring I've seen say that each +30
bits increase the difficulty by a factor of 10; I'm generously assuming
they get that down to a factor of 2), it's still easy for increasing
key lengths to leave increasing cracker resources behind.

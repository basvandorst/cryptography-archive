	Has there ever been a gov't organization surrounded by as much 
speculation as the NSA?  We know nothing about the NSA but with each post 
come assumptions, theories, and speculations.  All that we actually know 
is that we are clueless about the true goings-on of this ultra secretive 
facte of our gov't.  Can future posts be clean of wild fantasies of a 
"Super NSA" capable of factoring an RSA key during lunch hour, or 
monitoring the several million of voice and data trans-Atlantic traffic?  
These ideas degrade the effectiveness of postings and make the poster 
look very gullible.

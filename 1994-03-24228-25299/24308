Not necessarily.  They could:

1) simply snoop randomly until they find someone they want to prosecute
   (persecute).
2) use the information from encrypted messages to find other types of
   evidence.
3) claim one piece of evidence as the original and not present the 
   intrusion of the defendents privacy.

Even with this kind of trickery it is still likely that their secret will
be eventually compromised.  But, how many people will be jailed for bogus
crimes before that happens?

An anonymous person just reminded me that I had copied only 12 pages
of the paper.  There is more; it's just that I ran out of time
when I laboriously scanned these in months ago.  If I get the
gumption, I may dig up the rest of the paper and scan it in.
However, the 12 pages of the paper on the FTP server do give
a pretty good summary of the process, as I recall.

(As you recall, I got the paper anonymously in the mail in
the first place.  This secrecy stuff is pretty silly...)

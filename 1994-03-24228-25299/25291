To all those knowledgeable about PGP,

I have just recently become aware of PGP - not being a crypto boffin.
Judging from the write up in Philip Zimmerman's manual it seems to be
quite pretty good privacy. I have not followed the discussions in
this conference, but I am sure there must have been quite a lot of
discussion on the subject of security of PGP. Would somebody that is
knowledgeable about this topic please, in a few words, summarize what
the consensus opinion on the security of PGP is?

Regards.

Graham

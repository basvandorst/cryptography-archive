I recall a short paper on this topic at last November's First ACM Conference
on Computer and Communication Security on generating restricted keysets
for use with regular  DES for export.  I don't remember the exact title of the
paper or who the author was, but I think the work was from IBM.

Sorry to be so vague, but I can't find my copy of the proceedings.

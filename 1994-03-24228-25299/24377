Okay, I think we're talking about 2 different problems.

your suggestion is for generating key number 0, the one that
must be shared between the sender and receiver.

I was discussing key updates that are done algorithmically to
produce key number n+1 as a deterministic function of key number n.
sender and receiver would update these without exchanging further
keys.

If one exchanges session keys frequently enough, then
updating probably wouldn't be used.

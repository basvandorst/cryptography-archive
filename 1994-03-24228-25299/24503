I sent a copy of this message to Jim Bidzos, the President of RSADSI Inc.
His reply was that the use of the RSA algorithm you describe is o.k. with
prior written permission. Apparently they granted YOU such permission.

There is no general "ticket of leave" about this, though and their position
about PGP (other than Viacrypt) appears to be that such use is an
infringement in the U.S. since permission was denied Phil Zimmermann for
that when he requested it.

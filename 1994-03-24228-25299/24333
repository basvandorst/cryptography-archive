Hi Folks,

Some question relating to using Kerberos on large systems:

1.	What is the largest user population using Kerberos today?
2.	How has Kerberos scaled for multiple domain todays?
3.	What problems can one anticipate in using Kerberos for large systems?
	(~10,000 to ~100,000 users, 100s domains, mobile users...)
4.	Many of us agree Kerberos is majorly for Authentication - but
	if you really want to use it for Encryption Key Management (after all
	the process of deriving keys from passwords for clients, servers or
	any combination ther off - is kind of session key generation) - what
	kind of an overkill will it be?
5.	Kerberos with DCE Directory and Time services - what potential 
	exists for Key Management?

Would much appreciate NetTutoring through email replies - 
will summarize by excitement scale.

Many thanx in advance - Srini

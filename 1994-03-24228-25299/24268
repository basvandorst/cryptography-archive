Not as easy as it once was though. Current legislation to reduce the 
radiation from CRT's and the introduction of solid state display technology 
have taken their toll.

And isn't that precisely the purpose of 'TEMPEST' standards.

Shielding goes a long way to help but may not be a complete answer, certainly
 for mains operated equipment.

Hmmmm....
Are you suggesting *generating* RFI?? :-)

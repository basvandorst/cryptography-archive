You either missed my highly incisive article (:-) or it hasn't reached
you as of the time you're writing this :-)  The limits to growth
demolosh the parallel cracker machine user's budget long before the 
crypto user is seriously annoyed, except for special cases like smartcards,
for which RSA is already annoying.

Triple-IDEA has a key length 2-3 times as long as IDEA, and takes only
3 times as long to run, which means you might be a little bit bored 
encrypting your email on an 8086 or a slow 80286, but won't have a
problem on your 386 or 486, and brute-force decryption takes at least
2**128 times the age of the universe on a machine the size of Earth,
which is somewhere outside the NSA's conceivable budget.

RSA speed is proportional to N**2 for encryption and N**3 for key generation;
doubling key lengths slows the RSA encryption part of PGP by a factor of four,
and the key-generation time by a factor of eight.  Key-generation
isn't something you do very often, so it's irrelevant here.
Bringing RSA up to age-of-the-universe quality requires somewhere between
2048 and 4096 bit keys, depending on your estimates of how much Earth
can be used for cracking, or how fast theory improves the cracking algorithms.
1024-bit keys are mildly annoying on 386s; you may want to use 2048s
only on special occasions until Pentium-class laptops drop below $2000,
which will probably be a year or two (desktops of that speed are
already under $5000.)  On the other hand, the main thing you need
more-than-lifetime quality encryption for are things like financial
trusts (PC rental is cheaper than lawyer time) or revolutions 
(if you haven't won in 10 years, your old messages probably won't be
tactically important, and portable PCs should be a *lot* faster..)

To look at a more realistic scenario, Wiener's DES-cracker tries 2**55
DES keys in about 3.5 hours, which is about 2**66 per year, for $1M.
If the NSA wanted to spend $10Billion on a crackerbox, if would get
about 2**79 keys per year.  If IDEA and Clipper keys are equal work to
test for as DES, that says this machine ought to be able to crack a
Clipper key in about a year, and an IDEA key in about 65 trillion years.

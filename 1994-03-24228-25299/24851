Does anyone know of a way of defining this more precisely?  The trouble
is that given a hash, you already have some information about the input
which produces the hash---namely, that it produces that hash.

Ideally we'd have an encryption algorithm that only used the major
property of cryptographic message digest functions, namely that it is
computationally infeasable to generate two messages that collide.  I'm
not sure if that's possible, though...

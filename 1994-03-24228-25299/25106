   Does anyone know whether Matsui's linear attacks on DES are made any harder
with independent subkeys?

   Hmmm.  This is true, but I don't think an attacker would be able to
do any better than to eliminate half the key bits in some sort of meet-
in-the-middle attack.  A 383-bit keysearch may take a while....

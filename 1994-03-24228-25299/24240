The CRT is important as it is usually a very easy way to snoop.
Lots of people know how to do this.

These are worth caring about if you want to make it harder for specialists
to snoop.

If you don't know better you might connect an unshielded printer to
your computer. If the shielding of the computer is good, then it would
only reveal what is sent to the printer.

Maybe you need to add some noice to the environment for best effect.

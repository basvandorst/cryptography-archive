In article <fischer1-120394112621@via-annex3-48.cl.msu.edu> fischer1@student.msu.edu (Michael Fischer) writes:

   IF someone gets a hold of another's "secring.pgp" file, and attempts to
   decrypt this other person's ciphertext with this stolen secret key, can
   they do it without knowing the pass phrase?

No.

   What I am essentially asking is this : Does the pass phrase reside ANYWHERE
   within "secring.pgp", or is the file "secring.pgp" itself encrypted, so
   that even if someone steals someone elses secret key ring, they STILL
   cannot get it to work...

The secret key is encrypted with the passphrase.

   Please tell me how secure "secring.pgp" is, and try to be as specific as
   possible.

secring.pgp is as secure as the bits and your passphrase (and IDEA).
If you choose a good passphrase, and don't write it down, and don't
let anyone know it, the best chance someone has is to break IDEA or
factor your public key, or using rubber-hose cryptanalysis and beating
the passphrase out of you. ;-)

Hope this helps

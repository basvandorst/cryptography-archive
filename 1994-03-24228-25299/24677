I have just released SFS, my secure filesystem for DOS and Windows (and a few
operating systems too eventually, if I get the time).  It's available to the
world as:
 
    garbo.uwasa.fi:/pc/crypt/sfs100.zip
 
and from garbo mirror sites.  It's also available to US-only users as:
 
    csn.org:/mpj/I_will_not_export/crypto_???????/secdrv/sfs100.zip
 
where the ??????? is in /mpj/README.MPJ.  This means of access is used to
comply with US export restrictions.  Please don't use this site unless you're
in the US.
 
Finally, it's also available for US users on the Colorado Catacombs BBS,
303-938-9654.
 
 
SFS has the following features:
 
  - The current implementation runs as a standard DOS device driver, and
    therefore works with plain old DOS as well as other software such as
    Windows, QEMM, Share, disk cacheing software, and so on.
 
  - Up to five encrypted volumes can be accessed at any one time, chosen from
    a selection of as many volumes as there is storage for.
 
  - Volumes can be quickly unmounted with a user-defined hotkey, or
    automatically unmounted after a certain amount of time.  They can also be
    converted back to unencrypted volumes or have their contents destroyed if
    required.
 
  - The encryption algorithms used have been selected to be free from any
    patent restrictions, and the software itself is not covered by US export
    restrictions as it was developed entirely outside the US (although once a
    copy is sent into the US it can't be re-exported).
 
  - SFS complies with a number of national and international data encryption
    standards, among them ANSI X3.106, Federal Information Processing Standard
    (FIPS) 180, Australian Standard 2805.5.2, ISO 10116:1991 and ISO
    10126-2:1991, and is on nodding terms with a several other relevant
    standards.
 
  - The documentation includes fairly in-depth analyses of various security
    aspects of the software, as well as complete design and programming details
    necessary to both create SFS-compatible software and to verify the
    algorithms used in SFS.
 
  - Reasonable throughput and size.  One beta-tester has reported a throughput
    of 250 K/s for the basic version and 260 K/s for the 486+ version on his
    486 system when copying a file with the DOS copy command from one location
    on an SFS volume to another (I get about 160 K/s on my vanilla 386 box).
    The resident portion requires 6.5K of memory, and can be loaded high if
    desired.
 
Peter.

NB: Apologies if this appears twice - our news system is having emotional 
    problems at the moment.

I really don't think so....  if you can show me a (respected) member of
the cryptographic community that uses the term "field" this way I will
change that, and also be amazed that such a thing would be done by otherwise
very reasonable people!  :-)   In fact, a field is a ring in which there
are *NO* non-zero values without a multiplicative inverse.  That's what you
stated as the "mathematical" definition, and that's the only way I've
ever seen it used (and in my opinion the only way it should *ever* be
used).  Quite the opposite of what you said, fields are quite interesting...

Ouch.  And for the sake of this ill-defined concept you are willing to
sacrifice a perfectly precise and useful term of mathematics?

If the factorization of n is hard to compute, so is that of 2n.  Yet I
can find non-invertible non zero elements of Z/2nZ any time of the
day.  Also, with n=RSA129, Z/nZ will presumably be a field today, but
not in another month?

Ah.  So at least you know the proper definition.

I am sure Diffie and Hellman would be interested to hear this.  Also,
when n=pq with p and q prime, Z/nZ is isomorphic to the direct sum of
Z/pZ and Z/qZ by the Chinese Remainder theorem.  That is, the sum of
two fields.  Uninteresting?

I am sorry about the flamage, but I think it is necessary to stick to
standard terminology and precise concepts, or else confusion will
surely reign.  It's just too bad that we cannot yet make precise
statements about the difficulty of factoring...

As a matter of fact, yes. I used similar wording in my first CJ, the
one for the Applied Cryptography book itself. A few days after filing
it I got a call from an engineer at the Commerce Dept. He said that
they considered my request to be a "real work of art", and he wanted
me to know how much they enjoyed it. He claimed that it had three of
them on the floor, and even one of their lawyers thought it quite
funny.

Of course, this was the Commerce dept, which has always been far more
reasonable about such matters than State/NSA. Remember that the actual
purpose of a CJ is to get jurisdiction transferred from State to
Commerce. In *effect* this approves export, because commerce exempts
all publicly available information from explicit licensing
requirements, as would any "reasonable" set of export regulations.

Noting that you are in Australia, it is likely to be illegal for anyone
in the United States to send you anything.  In theory, it is also
illegal for you to download anything from, for example, ftp.rsa.com
(because they deal in lots of crytographic software, including DES and
public key algorithms), but I am not sure how prosecution would proceed
in that case.

If you join the sci.crypt newsgroup, you can find out more about this.

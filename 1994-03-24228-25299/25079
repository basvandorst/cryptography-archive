     The "WINDS" Messages were an attempt at steganography - they were
written in such a way that they sounded like normal weather forecasts
unless you knew what to listen for. The BBS -> underground messages made
no attempt to conceal their nature.

    Try renting "The Longest Day", which has a scene of French
underground fighters listening for such messages. I think the lead-in
phrase was something like "And now some messages for our listeners in
Europe..." I have no idea of it's accuracy.

A good point.  I just didn't think of it.  However, IMO, his patent cannot
be rescued no matter how cleverly amended.  His patent reaches at something
so basic that I doubt it can be patented.  It's like getting a patent at 
this late stage for blanks between words.  

I appreciate your term, "vanity patent".  IMO this is a vanity patent.

My real concern is not whether or not software patents are a Good Thing,
but whether we can discuss crypto openly without fear of getting sued,
dressed down, or having somebody complain to our employers.  Software
patents per se are a separate issue.

   Hopefully the organizers will compare RSA-129 with keys typically used
   in public-key applications to quell the rumours that "RSA has been broken"
   that will inevitably spring up, but here's a comparison.

   129 digits is roughly 430 bits.  Thus, it is a graphic demonstration that
   384-bit keys are indeed breakable, albeit with significant effort.
   (This is why PGP calls them "casual security.")  512 bits is significantly
   harder than has been attempted (what's the work multiplier for an extra 82
   bits here?), and 1024 bits is still miles out of reach.


The work multiplier depends on a number of factors, not least on which
algorithm is used.  The very best of modern algorithms could have done
RSA-129 in about half or a third of the time we took.  "Best" in this
sense means minimum number of cpu instructions.  Our method is still
best in the sense "most practical".  The other algorithms require
significantly bigger machines and the implementations are not so
robust yet.  We wanted to stick with well known and widely available
technology.

Answering your question, therefore, means saying *about* a
hundred-fold increase in computation is required to break 512-bit
keys.  The true answer may be anywhere between thirty and three
hundred.

The resources we used were acquired by asking interested volunteers to
use idle cycles on common workstations and PC's, though I shouldn't
neglect the half-dozen or so MasPar owners who made very significant
contributions.  It is quite clear that many corporations: DEC, Sun,
major banks, etc and government departments can put together several
times the processing power we have had.  I estimate that a thousand
DEC-alpha boxes could factor RSA-129 in 2-4 weeks.

I'll leave it to you to decide whether 512-bit keys are secure enough
for your needs.  One thing I am reasonably sure of is that kilobit
keys are safe for quite a few years yet, unless there are remarkable
breakthroughs in factoring abilities.  It is no coincidence that my
PGP key is 1024 bits.

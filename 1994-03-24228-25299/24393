Sorry, but the article you've included has lots of flaws, errors, and
outright bogosity.  It's the 1990 draft by Christopher Seline which
has been floating around like a bad urban legend.  It's not correct
technically, and it's not correct legally; it's wrong from the initial
explanation of the acronym TEMPEST, which isn't an acronym and doesn't
deal with Transient Electromagnetic Pulses as the purported
explanation says.
(-: Flame off :-)
It's also a bit inconvenient to have to save a file, uudecode, and uncompress,
and the ~50KB of text fits well into the ~60-64KB limit that some
systems still have.; straight ASCII would have been ok.

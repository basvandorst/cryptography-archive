The security of your Secret Key depends on the quality of your pass phrase:
+   if you don't use a pass phrase then your only assurance of secrecy
    is to prevent other people getting secring.pgp
+   if your pass phrase is 'simple', then your secret key might be accessed
    by guessing the pass phrase (eg by trying words from a dictionary, or
    using a password guessing program).
+   if your pass phrase is relatively long, then the security is that your
    RSA secret key is encrypted with IDEA (64 bit key length) - the key for
    the IDEA encryption/decryption is calculated mathematically from
    your pass phrase (using an algorithim called MD5).


Hope this helps,

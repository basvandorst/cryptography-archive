They most certainly do. When comparing mod  n, the only thing you are comparing is EQUIVALENCE.

:4 mod 3 does *NOT* equal 7, which would have to be the case if these
 
It does not EQUAL 7, but it is EQUIVALENT to 7.

You (and others) keep mixing up the use of the "=" sign. In one context
it is being taken as "equality", in the other it is "equivalence",
when in fact when talking mod n, it is ALWAYS "equivalence".

7 = 4 mod 3   is the SAME as  4 mod 3 = 7.  The "=" sign is an EQUIVALENCE
relation. 4 mod 3 = 7 = 1.  

:two things were "merely different notation for the same thing."
 
They are the same, your protests notwithstanding.

Serge Lang would say "Your notation sucks".

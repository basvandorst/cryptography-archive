we'd like to try to get u.s. export approval for
a des-based security product, without massively
modifying our code, and without licensing a
proprietary crypto algorithm. one strategy we're
considering is to reduce the effective key length
by generating 56-bit keys from 40-bit ones, so
that exhaustive key-search will be tractable enough
to satisfy the nsa and the commerce dept. however,
i suspect that some naive approaches to this, like
zeroing out some fixed set of 16 key bits, might
make other cryptanalytic attacks even faster than
exhaustive search would be. a less naive approach
would be to feed a 40 bit key into md5, and keep
the first 56 bits, but this may be more computation
than we need here, since the 40-to-56-bit conversion
needn't be one-way, but only needs good statistical
properties.

does anyone know of work on this topic?

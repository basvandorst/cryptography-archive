Dear Netters:

	Have you heard any device to encrypt phone call?

	Is there any device commercial available such that:
	If
		1. Alice attach the device to her phone line
		2. Bob attach the device to his phone line
		3. Charles attach the device to his phone line
	and
		after they configure the device 
	,the phone call between Alice and Bob is encrypted.
	The phone call between Charles and Alice is also encrypted.

	How about its cost?	


	Thanks in advance.

	It seems that the police here enhance phone tapping practice.

Cheers,
Min

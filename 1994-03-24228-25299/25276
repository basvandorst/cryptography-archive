Yes and no.   A real Windows version of PGP would be great. As for just
doing a front end that calls the DOS executables, no thanks (for me at
least).  My experience with windows front ends for DOS programs has not
been great. But....since the source code for PGP is on the net a real
Windows Native version should be more than possible.

Just my $0.02.

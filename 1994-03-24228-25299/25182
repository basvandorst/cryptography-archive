Seconded. Last year I suggested a sci.crypt.research just as there is a
sci.math.research. I still support the idea, but since I am editing `Security 
Reviews' in addition to my academic work I don't have the time to moderate it. 

I expect that someone else can be found to do this, and even if not, an 
unmoderated sci.crypt.research would still be very useful,

Eli submitted the paper to the Cambridge Algorithms Workshop (the conference
I write about in the Apr 94 Dr. Dobbs Journal.)  Unfortunately, he was not
there to present it.   Springer-Verlag is going to publish the proceedings
of the conference, but I don't know if Biham's paper will be published or
not.

Ross, you read this newsgroup.  Is Biham's paper in the final proceedings?

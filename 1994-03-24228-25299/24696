Does anyone know where I can get an implementation (any language) or
a decent description of the Berlekamp-Massey LFSR synthesis algorithm
for finding the shortest LFSR for a given sequence.

Please respond with e_mail to

PS. Our library does not get IEEE Trans. on Info. Theory, which is where
the original article appeared.

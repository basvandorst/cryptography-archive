If SkipJack is as good an algorithm as it is puported to be, then it
need not be, and indeed *shouldn't* be classified.  A strong algorithm is
one in which does *not* depend on one's attacker not knowing the
algorithm.  If Skipjack was made public we could sit here all day debating
it's relative strengths & weaknesses instead of wasting our time on DS.


Very sophisticated means of negotiating session keys are available.
The easiest to understand is one based on public key cryptography:

(from Applied Cryptography by Bruce Schneier)

Bob sends Alice his public key.*
Alice generates a random session key, k, encrypts it using Bob's public key,
and sends it to Bob.
Bob then decrypts Alice's message using his private key.
Both of them encrypt their communications using the same session key.

* and we all remember that your public key is just that - public - sending it
in the clear doesn't compromise the security of the system

(substitute your favourite clipper chips for bob and alice ... )

You're hardly an idiot for suggesting session keys be negotiated using
ROT13, but it could be said that session keys are pretty basic stuff
and of course, it's in the FAQ.  But no problem...

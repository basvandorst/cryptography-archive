RSADSI says such people are infringing. Lots of people break the speed laws,
but when the Highway Patrol stops you YOU get to pay a fine or go to jail.

In the U.S. it's much safer to pay for and use Viacrypt PGP, since that
company does have a license for RSA.

As long as it's not in violation of your own country's laws, as far as
anyone here knows the answer is yes. But note that PGP uses IDEA, and the
owners of IDEA have given a license only for free, noncommercial use. If you
want to use PGP for commercial purposes you DO have to pay the Swiss who own
IDEA a royalty or you are in violation of their patent in ANY country that
recognizes it, including the US.

By the way, I didn't see it mentioned, but I assume Viacrypt has a license
for commercial sale of IDEA, as well as a license for RSA.

It's kind of hard to think of applications like this where public
key cryptography is really crucial.  Public keys give a very convenient
method of key management, but for these big construction bids and
so forth, you have to be sure of your recipient and there are probably
some face to face meetings preceding the bid, so there are opportunities
to securely exchange conventional secret keys.

Rough estimate: 3000 bit RSA decryption should take a few minutes on
today's cheap PC's, or maybe 10 seconds for a careful implementation
on a high end workstation.  This doesn't seem too long to wait for a
super secret oil field bid, though it's inconveniently long for
routine private email.

Re a) Key generation might take an hour or two on a PC, but that seems
like no problem.  b), what a weak key is depends on what factoring
algorithms are used, and the best algorithms very well might be
secret, so there is no way to know what keys are weak.  c) they'd
never tell about such breakthroughs, so until provably secure crypto
systems arise, one can NEVER tell if any particular key is too hard
for a three letter agency to break.

All evidence is that 1024-bit RSA keys are unbreakable in practice and
will stay that way for a while, and 1024 bit RSA keys are quite
useable on today's cheap PC's.  Widespread use of 1024 bit keys will
almost certainly annoy the FBI every bit as much as widespread use of
3000 bit keys.  There's no question that some factions in the govt
ALREADY want to ban non-escrowed crypto.  The govt is not a monolithic
entity; it's all a question of which faction gets the upper hand and when.

Also, the time needed for RSA arithmetic depends more on a CPU's
architecture and implementation than its clock speed.  A 50 MHz Power
Mac should be substantially faster for RSA than a a 66 MHz Intel 486
or probably even a 100 MHz Pentium, but might be slower than the 40
MHz (?)  Motorola 56000 used as an audio coprocessor in the Quadra AV
series, simply because of the architectural differences between those
processors, given optimized RSA implementations for each of them.

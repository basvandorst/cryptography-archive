It sounds like you did the right thing.  All they wanted from me was
my SSN so they could do a credit check.  I didn't even have to prove
that I was who I said I was.

I cross-posted this to alt.privacy in case anybody has an idea why the
cellphone distributor might have *really* wanted that info (mailing
list sales, etc.).  This kind of thing is discussed over there more
often.

Side note: if I were to have sent you private e-mail, is there an account
           named "anonymous" or would it have bounced?

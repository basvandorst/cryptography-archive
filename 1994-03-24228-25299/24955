Yes, it's in there. However, the bulk of the material on triple DES CBC is in a
later paper, which he has sent to Crypto 94.

I was just speaking to Heidelberg yesterday, and unfortunately the proceedings 
won't be available until the beginning of June. So they won't be on sale at 
Oakland and Eurocrypt in May as we originally hoped: but there will be order 
forms at Eurocrypt, and stocks for sale at later conferences such as Crypto.

So if you want to get hold of both papers, come to Crypto this year!

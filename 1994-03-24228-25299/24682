Summary: Response to requests for detail

Since responding to a request last week for a good introduction to number 
theory, I've received a bunch of e-mail requests for deatils, enough to 
justify a general posting. The book in question is:

__Elementary Number Theory__  by James K. Strayer, 1994. PWS Publishing. 
ISBN 0-534-93672-5. Cost is $45-50. If you can't find it, call PWS Kent 
at 1-800-831-6996. (I have no connection with either PWS or Mr. Strayer)

What I particularly like about this book is that the proofs are very 
thorough. It's been 25 years since I studied any math in school and I'm 
often frustrated by proofs that skip most of the middle, saying "it is 
obvious that..." when it's anything but to me. For all that, Strayer is a 
slender volume. It also has a section near the end on cryptographic 
applications, including an explanation of how RSA works.

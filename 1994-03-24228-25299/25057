Yes, of course the RSA keys are longer than 128 bits in both PGP and RIPEM.
Any bozo with a PC can quickly factor a 128 bit number these days.
Paul Leyland has been showing how even 430 bit numbers can be
factored by (very talented and dedicated) amateurs using
scrounged computing resources.  Who knows what the NSA can do.

PGP's IDEA bulk encryption has 128 bit keys.
RIPEM's TDES is triple DES with two 56-bit keys, for 112 bits of key space.
112 bits is still enough to stop any feasible naive brute force attack.
This of course does not imply that deeper cryptanalysis of either system 
is impossible.

Really David, most sci.crypt inhabitants will probably never agree
with your political views, but you could still get flamed a lot less
on technical issues if you paid a little attention to elementary
arithmetic before making technical claims.  Reading Bruce's book as
you have been doing is a good way to get started, but you also need to
apply the information you find there.  Brute force search of an n bit
key space takes O(2^n) operations, but even the most naive factoring
algorithm needs only O(2^(n/2)).  Smarter algorithms do a lot better.
RSA key lengths and conventional key lengths are NOT directly comparable.

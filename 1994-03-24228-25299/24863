Tempest techniques can pick up keystrokes almost as easily as monitor pictures.
There's no defense against determined spooks.  The important point is securing
the information from casual police snooping.  I'd like to see destructive
protection that wipes all the files if someone tries to get at the files using
an improper procedure--that way you can happily submit your key when ordered
by a judge to do so.

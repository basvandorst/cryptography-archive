   Not possible, due to information theoretical requirements, unless YOU
   EXPAND THE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION IN THE SYSTEM.

Well, Peter Wayner's Mimic functions could be used for an alternative approach,
without having to actually include both texts in the cyphertext.
Mimic functions are designed primarily for steganography; they let you
model an arbitrary set of input as context-free grammars, so you can
take the bits of your real message and drive the grammar to produce
syntactically correct output for transmission, which can be decoded
to produce your original bits (which obviously should be encrypted by
a real cryptosystem.)  However, you *could* use them as an alternate
decoder instead, so your "decrypt" program is really generating 
bogus mimic-text that matches the kind of stuff that might really be
on your system.

This is tougher to get away with than the standard use of Mimic functions,
which is to produce text that looks normal enough to escape notice by
automated searches, rather than to still look real when read by humans
with somewhat more discriminating taste...  mimictext generally looks
pretty awkward unless you've done a very good job of picking a useful
grammar to feed it.  On the other hand, you could have your grammar do
something like generate a working machine-language program for drawing
graphics or something like that that's not intended to be human-readable,
so the fact that it's boringly repetitious and meaningless is less obvious.

Stewart seems to be ranting again...

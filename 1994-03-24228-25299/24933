 Hahahaha. Good one, James. :) Surely you are not using this to
 <gasp> support the DTWP and Clipper....?

 If you *are* supporting the DTWP, why not just make it easier for
 the government and hang some wires from a tree in your frontyard
 with the sign:

                Mr. Agent,

                        Seeing as how your job is so important to
                        security of the American people and the
                        security of the free world, you may
                        wiretap my phone, without a warrant,
                        whenever you wish.

                        I have connected these wires to my telephone
                        to make your job that much easier. Simply
                        connect to these wires and you
                        can hear everything that is said on the
                        telephone.

                        I am also considering placing
                        microphones in my living room, kitchen,
                        bedroom, and bathroom so that you may
                        hear me watching TV, cooking, talking
                        in my sleep, and loosening my bowels.

                        Next in line are cameras that will be
                        placed in the living room, kitchen, dining
                        room, bedroom, and bathroom. This way
                        you can see if I am doing any illegal
                        things.

                        Oh, and just so you know, I have placed
                        a Clipper chip between all these wires,
                        to protect my privacy, and so that
                        you can not evesdrop on me unless you
                        have a "legal warrant."

                        Just wanting to make your job of
                        wiretapping easier, legally
                        or illegally.

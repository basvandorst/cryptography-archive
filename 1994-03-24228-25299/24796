                              CALL FOR PAPERS

            A workshop sponsored by ACM SIGSAC and DOD

                         NEW SECURITY PARADIGMS '94


  Paradigm shifts disrupt the status quo, destroy outdated ideas, and open
  the way to new possibilities.  This workshop explores new ways of looking
  at computer security, hoping to develop transcendent solutions that
  provide the interoperability and flexibility users need in trusted systems.

                         AUGUST 3-5, 1994
                         Stone House Club
                         Little Compton, R.I.

  New Security Paradigms '94 provides a creative and constructive workshop
  environment at a small seaside inn for 20 researchers.  Dress is casual.
  The workshop fee of about $450 includes room, meals, and workshop materials.

  To participate, submit a research paper or a 5-10 page position paper (5 copies) to one of the two program chairs by March 26, 1994.  The Program Committee will referee the papers and
 notify authors of acceptance by June 11, 1994.  Proceedings will be
 published by ACM.

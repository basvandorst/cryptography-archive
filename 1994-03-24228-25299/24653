Presuming the original text is not gibberish you can perform some analysis
of the frequency with which letters occur in the cipher text, and compare
with the frequency with whch they occur in normal text in the same language.
This is probably described in a number of books, though I suggest Dorothy
Denning's "Cryptography and Data Security" (first few pages of chapter 2),
1981 Addison-Wesley ISBN 0-201-10150-5

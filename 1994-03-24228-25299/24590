I have the following queries and would like to have some clarification 
from someone with knowledge on this.

1) I heard recently from a west-european security firm that they 
maintain there is no difference between volatile and non-volatile 
storage for protection of keys in security modules.

2) In the latest crypto-adapters from IBM they provide permanent backup 
battery power (5-7 Years life) for non-volatile protection of key 
storage but then also a jumper on the power routing to allow a user to 
convert this to volatile protection if required. Would you see this as 
confirmation that there is a differnce between the two modes of 
protection.

Thanks in advance

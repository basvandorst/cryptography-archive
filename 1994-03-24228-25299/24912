	This is the corrected BLOWFISH code.  BLOWFISH is a secret key algorithm
	that appeared in the Apr 94 Dr. Dobbs Journal.

	This posting includes:
		blowfish.h
		blowfish.c
		blowfish.dat.uu

	In deference to U.S. export laws, this code is being posted for "usa"
	distribution only.

You have to admire someone with chutzpa like that!

  To all indications, we're *at* that point, which is why the government
is trying to convince us that the sky is falling.

  Sigh.  Do you have *any* idea of the implications of exponential
increase?
  Even if the computers are a million times faster than anybody suspects,
that simply means (by the most liberal estimates I've seen) that RSA keys
need to be increased by 180 bits.

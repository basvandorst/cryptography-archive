In a previous posting I asked if anyone knew an algorithm to decode
Caesar Ciphers.  As many of you probably know (and I didn't) there are
only 26 possible combinations for these ciphers.  What I meant to ask
was if anyone knew how to decode monoalphabetic substitution ciphers
(which map each letter of the alphabet to another-or the same-letter
of the alphabet, 26! possibilities.)

I'd appreciate any help.

Thanks in advance.

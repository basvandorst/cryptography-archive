   I've added yet another option to the SFS driver which will

An intermediate step would be to do what many login programs do,
and show a * (or whatever) for each character typed,
so you can more easily remember where you are and notice if you
double-struck or missed a key.  I find this especially useful on
laptops, since the keyboard may not be at a normal height or angle.

   (along with dire warnings in the docs about how easy it is
   to read them using TEMPEST techniques).

(since somebody asked, it's much easier to read characters from the
screen than from the keyboard, especially if they hang around for a while.
However, if you really have to care, it's probably because they *are*
out to get you.... or because there are electrical engineering
students hanging around the computer lab looking for trouble :-)

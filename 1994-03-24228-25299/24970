My guesses at your motives may or may not be correct.  That in no way
affects the validity of the math presented.

Thank you.  I should have added that myself, but it slipped my mind.

IDEA uses 128-bit keys.  The number of keys possible is:

2^128 = 3.4028237E38

Hope this clears it up.

I'd say that not only is the 80 year / single processor estimate "off" but
is patently absurd.  In fact, I would state that given the time estimate
for a billion processor machine using billion-key-per-second-processors,
that even using every single scrap of man-made, digital computing
power ever built you still couldn't BF (brute-force) a 128-bit key.

Since we seem to have gotten into the world of sci.crypt, and this
'EFFector Online' thread seems to be getting a bit long in the tooth,
I've moved this into a new thread.

I have to admit that I'm not sure exactly what topic we are discussing,
so I'm making a guess.  It seems that David Sternlight's position is that
the Skipjack algorithm provides better cryptographic protection
than other algorithms on the market.  Such good protection that it's
release to the general public would be a threat to National Security.
Inherent in this claim is the assumption that other crypto algorithms
do NOT provide a level of security sufficent for protection from the
NSA.  Being a fan of organized debate, I will throw up an assertion for
us to discuss.

Asserted that the unrestricted use of the Skipjack encryption
algorithm will create a threat to National Security whereas the
unrestricted us of the IDEA algorithm creates no such threat.

I assume that Mr. Sternlight will be taking the affirmative view.  I will
volunteer to argue the negative.  Please feel free to offer a different
assertion for discussion if this one does not suit you.

P.S. Let's try to keep the S/N ratio on this thread relatively high.
Specifically I ask that the career Sternlight-bashers put their
flames ELSEWHERE unless they have something constructive to
add to the discussion.

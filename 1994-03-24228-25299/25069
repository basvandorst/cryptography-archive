Well said and I agree. 

I'm glad that David S posts his arguments here. He generally offers  
well-considered and serious arguments "on the opposing side." To date, he 
hasn't moved me from my libertarian position on these issues. And, 
having listened to much of what he says, I'm pleased of this. 

You write a piece of code, you build a bridge, or whatever, and then 
it's time to test it. David is a test. Maybe you've already heard everything 
he has said or could say, but not everyone has. Regardless, he has every 
right to say it.

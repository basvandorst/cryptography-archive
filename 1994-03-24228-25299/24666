   Unless there's some weird, unforseen interaction between DES and
IDEA, it looks to me like encrypting first with DES, then with IDEA,
then with DES again, or doing the reverse, would be pretty strong.
This is simply triple-encryption, with two different algorithms as well
as keys.  Or, maybe triple-encryption could be done with (say) Khufu,
then DES, then IDEA.  Even if it turned out that Khufu and IDEA were no
stronger than the Caesar cipher, attacks would still be as hard as on
DES.
 
   If I'm not mistaken, both IDEA and Khufu (with 24 rounds or so) will
be faster than DES in software....
 
   One comment:  I'd be pretty careful about interspersing DES and IDEA
*rounds*--DES appears to be pretty strong as it's designed, but if you
want to change that design, you'd need to do some pretty in-depth analysis
of things like cascade effect, high-probability differentials, etc.

 Agreed. Mr. Sternlight may tick people off, but saying "*douse*" someone
 because of what they post is going too far. I can understand "*douse*ing"
 David if he was posting chain letters <g>, but that is a far cry
 from what he is doing.

 And, for those of you who still say: "*Douse* Sternlight!" I have this
 to say: A group like this needs a devil's advocate. David has kept
 more discussions going (both entertaining and *informative* at times)
 than I can count.

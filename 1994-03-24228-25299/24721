John K Taber in a recent post on sci.crypt implies that any RNG
patent must include a reference to George Marsaglia's work as
prior art because he "is _the_ world authority on rngs".  (This
is similar to saying that Burt Kaliski is _the_ authority on
non invertible encryption.)  Mr Taber is mistaken;  the _world_
authority on PRNG's and testing them is in my opinion Professor
Fishimi.  Mr Taber also makes a number of other questions and 
comments.  Unfortunately my time is too limited to respond.  
A closer reading of the patent should explain them.

Peter K Boucher in a recent post on sci.crypt was unhappy about
my comments on Algorithm M.  Again, I suggest reading the patent;
it is available free at any library which is a PTO repository.

An academic at Penn State (sorry the message was deleted) in a
recent post on sci.crypt stated that notifying potential private
email respondents of their email becoming the property of the
sendee was probably illegal is also mistaken because magazines 
and newspapers do the same.  The notice is very effective in
keeping private email from ill-mannered writers out of my box.

In recent weeks I have personally supplied a large number of
requests for my patent by mail and fax to readers of sci.crpt.
My experience to date has shown that their apparent purpose 
was not to understand the patent but rather to argue about it 
without being polite.  Consequently, I will supply copies of 
my patent only if requested by US mail to my residence below.
Requesters should state in detail their identity and interest.



Notice:  Private mail to me becomes my property and may be published.

My original post to sci.crypt of 3/11/94 on this thread quoted
Jenkins that the source code was 'now unpatentable and in the
worldwide public domain.  Please use it!'.  Colin James III
claims that those words were duly retracted publicly on
sci.crypt by Mr Jenkins on 3/8/94.  I have not verified this
independently, since our newsfeed is usually days or weeks
behind (note that I am posting via email).  I republished
Jenkins' words in my post of 3/11/94, not disagreeing with
them but in fact supporting them with the addition of the
same source code plus modifications.

James is not satisfied that my post of 3/12/94 sufficiently
retracts my post of 3/11/94, because all I did was inform the
readers of James' claim that the source code infringes upon
his patent.

James is further offended by my standard disclaimer 'The above
does not represent the opinions of my employer,'  which he
interprets to mean that my employer disagrees with my post.
If James would read a little more carefully, he would realize
that my employer's opinion could agree, disagree, or partially
agree with mine, but that nothing I post with that disclaimer 
should be misconstrued as representing my employer's opinion
because it is of a personal nature, or was written on my own
time, and not as part of my work.

James claims that the source code and 'unpatentable' comment
infringe the claims of US Patent No 5_251_165, "Two phase
random number generator", and that companies and/or individuals
must be licensed by the owner of the patent in order for them
or their employees to use, distribute, or sell the code.

I hereby publicly retract my two messages on sci.crpt of 
3/11/94 and 3/12/94 and duly state that those messages may have
infringed on claims of US Patent No 5_251_165, 'Two phase random 
number generator', and are hereby retracted in total.

I hereby also publicly call upon Colin James III to lighten up.  :-)
I would never knowingly infringe on patent rights, nor encourage
others to do so (witness the thread I started about 18 months ago
under the subject "Risks of using PGP").  The heavy-handed
legalistic tone of his messages to me was really not necessary.

Again, his patent lawyer can be reached at:

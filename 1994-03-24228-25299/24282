That's what I meant. If you were to design an encryption
scheme in software, that is stronger than DES but backwards
compatible, why couldn't you just say something like:

  if 56-bit key then encrypt
  else if 112-bit key then encrypt-encrypt-encrypt

There's no need for the middle block to be a decryption,
and therefore the E-D-E scheme makes sense only in archaic
hardware devices.

Of course, you could also rely on external information other
than the key size to tell you what kind of encryption to use.

One could make the argument that now that ViaCrypt has invested the money in
getting an RSA license, and producing a commercial version of PGP, one
should halt efforts to promote the "free" but allegedly infringing versions
of PGP in the U.S.

ViaCrypt, by their action, has done more for global interoperability of PGP,
than anyone I know. Since PGP fans have repeatedly argued that's an
important goal of theirs, I'd hope U.S. PGP users would back up that
rhetoric with a little hard cash.

Since this isn't really a sci.crypt topic any longer, note the followup
line.

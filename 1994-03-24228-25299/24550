Summary: Are there such sytems?

I've been following some of the discussions here over the past few weeks
concerning ways of hiding the very fact that you're sending encrypted
data(steganography). This got me to wondering if any crypto systems or
algorithms exist which would allow two different data streams, encrypted
with two different keys using two different transform methods, to produce
the same encrypted output. This would let someone create two messages, one
relatively innocuous and one possibly incriminating such that, when
encrypted by the two different methods and keys would produce an encypted
message whose true decryption could only be done by someone knowing the
"real" key and "real" transform method.

The advantage of such a system would lie in its ability to allow someone
to show someone, a judge or jury, for instance, that, regardless of what
some law enforcement official may say the encrypted message is hiding, its
actual decryption will produce an innocuous message.

I'm not aware of such a system, but then, I'm a relative novice when it
comes to cryptography. Does anyone know if there is such a system, or if
there is currently research being done to find such a system?

Incidentally, I'm not particularly interested in this question because I
have some nefarious scheme in mind; it's just that it struck me as an
interesting question.

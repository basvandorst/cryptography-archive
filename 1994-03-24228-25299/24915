You must have missed my "limits to growth" post. There's a limit on the
increase in using a longer key, imposed not by costs but by time to use such
a key.

The only limit imposed on the use of large multi-parallel processor machines
is the budget of the user.

An interested reader may calculate both numbers directly as an exercise. How
many parallel processors can one include in a fast state-of-the-art speed
machine built under government contract, if the limit on cost is, say,
one-tenth of the NSA's budget at any time (I made that ratio up out of whole
cloth--I have no inside information)? How long are the keys such a machine
can search in, say, three days? (I made that number up, too).

Now: how big a key can one use with today's commonly available work stations
if the limit on encryption is, say 15 seconds). (I made that one up, too).

One could produce a table of cryptanalysis budget vs. encryption time using
the ideas in the previous two paragraphs, in order to determine which key
sizes are robust against particular budgets, for those really interested in
pursuing this.

Note that I've added sci.crypt to the original writer's distribution list,
since the calculations suggested above legitimately fall within the charter
of that group. Though I think the number of newsgroups the writer used was
going a bit overboard, I'll leave it for him to correct in his next reply.

[?: How to determine if file is DES encrypted]
I think that most DES programs prefix a header of one sort or another to
the encrypted file.  The header usually includes the ICV, a timestamp,
and the same timestamp encrypted to check the accuracy of the user's key.
The header also includes the DES program's name, like PCCRYPT, or IPS
9999-XYZ, etc.

Look at the headers of DES encrypted files to see what you're looking
for.  I don't know all the headers offhand.

Anyhow, if you aren't worried about header lying, this should be 
good enough.

There ARE formal certification programs, but I think they're only available
for "hardware" (or firmware) implementations.  (You can't really certify an
implementation that runs in software in your PC or workstation.  There's no
way to guarantee it won't have been altered in some way before you run it,
or while you're running it.)

On our wall, we have certificates that read something like this:

       UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE

       Certificate of Appreciation

       Presented to ....

       For successful validation of a device as conforming to
       the Data Encryption Standard (FIPS 46.1).

NIST will validate a device's DES implementation, and issue a certificate
like this upon completion of successful testing.

In addition, I have a document "NBS Special Publication 500-61, Maintenance
Testing for the Data Encryption Standard", which describes validation tests.

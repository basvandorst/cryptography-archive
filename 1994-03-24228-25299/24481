With reference to A5 encryption for GSM etc:

The complete set of GSM algorithms are A3, A5 and A8.  The A3 and A8
algorithms have been "combined" (I won't go into technical details
here!) to produce the A38 algorithm.  This is used during call setup
for authentication etc.

The A5 algorithm is used for data confidentiality during the call.
It is NOT public key.  It is a symmetric algorithm using three
nested linear shift resisters and non-linear combiners to produce
a very non-linear output.  It uses a 64 bit user key and 22 bits
from the TDMA frame number to yield the complete key, and produces
2x114 bits per frame (each 4.7 ms ish) for full duplex encryption
of outgoing & decryption of incoming.

It is a highly sensitive algorithm that signatories to the MoU want
to keep secret!  COCOM regulations have prevented exports to COCOM
proscribed countries.  The "watered-down" version is called A5X and
is somewhat weaker.  (Mind you, A5 is not all that strong.  If the
concerned governments cannot break it they are not as good at crypt-
analysis as I thought.....but that is another story).

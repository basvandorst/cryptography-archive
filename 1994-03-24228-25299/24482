There are two main compatibility problems you run into
- different bit orders on different machines (word size,
	big-endian vs. little-endian, etc.)
- different file formats on different machines
	(end-of-line conventions, end-of-file, record-size, etc.)

Both problems are easy enough to work around for programmers that take
the time to do so.  Bit order problems can be handled transparently to
the user - the program defines a canonical bit-ordering, and
implementations on each flavor of machine make sure they handle it correctly.
File formats are more work, and the user sometimes needs to be aware
of them, since the program can't always tell things like whether a
file is pure binary or should be translated from one machine's text
format to another, e.g. adding/stripping CRs and ^Zs or displaying the
text in EBCDIC vs. ASCII, etc.

PGP handles these issues by using  canonical format and providing
options for the user to specify character set and text-conversion.
Works fine, if you remember to use a -t option on DOS.

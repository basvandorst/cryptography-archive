Are you implying the POSSIBILITY, at least, that DES and IDEA, when used
together, might form a "group" that could be WEAKER than either alone?  Yes,
it's obvious that it's "not either", but I think that was the main premise
for interleaving the two in the first place.

Barring a "group" dynamic from the combination, if independent keys were
used, the keyspace should be increased accordingly.  The best case for
cryptanalysis would be a "meet in the middle attack", which would cost one
full search of both algorithms.  Even if one is weak, you still have a full
search of the other to contend with, thus "diversifying" your exposure to
possibly unknown weaknesses in either.

Please correct me if any of my logic is faulty.

I wholeheartedly support a cryptography research newsgroup, either:

	sci.crypt.research
	sci.crypt.theory

I don't care what it is called, as long as it is in the sci.crypt
hierarchy.

And I would prefer it to be moderated.

The last time this came up, at least two people volunteered to be
moderators.

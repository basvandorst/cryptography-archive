Hi- my name is Michael Anshel and I'm a Professor of Computer Science 
at The City College of New York. Would your plnaned book be suitable for a 
student/faculty seminar? Also are you aware of more advanced encryption methods
(beyond the number theoretic ones)? See a paper co-authored with my daughter in
the November 1993 American Mathematical Monthly. I gave a talk to a group at
NSA on that topic.

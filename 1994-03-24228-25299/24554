I thought up an interesting possible encryption scheme, that should lend 
itself to easy, cheap hardware implementation (a possible competitor for 
Clipper) but I don't know enough about cryptanalysis to determine whether
it is secure. Anybody interested in taking a whack at it? You can get the
text description, C source, and MS-DOS executable by ftping onto
ftp.std.com and looking in the /ftp/pub/wware directory. I am a much better
logic designer than cryptanalyst, and it was designed to be painlessly
implementable with off-the-shelf programmable logic devices (e.g. Xilinx).
Any comments or suggestions are welcome; I am at <wware.std.com>. Thanks!

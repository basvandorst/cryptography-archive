That's what I've been told by lawyers concerning other patents.

Has anyone looked at the patent?  Is it the typical, stupid software patent
that should never have been granted that it sounds like?

It does seem that the patent office is sadly similar to the vanity press,
the publishers that accept your manuscript and some money, and give you
a pile of books with your very own name on the cover and your very own
text inside.  I think most of the customers of the vanity press are
novelists and poets, but there are plenty with proofs that General
Relativity is all wrong or procedures to trisect angles.

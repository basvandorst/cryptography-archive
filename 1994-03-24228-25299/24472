	   Seems to be that way.  I first came across RSA in Scientific
	   American - nobody told them they couldn't export that issue.

Here's something that confuses me ;-)

I thought it was illegal to export DES source code electronically from
the US.

Anyone taken a look recently at Federal Information Processing
Standards Publication 181, aka FIPS181, published by the National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) ?

Or do I have a contraband copy?

I'm not at all sure how it arrived on a machine in Oxford UK.  I found
it already resident.

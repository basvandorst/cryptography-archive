Well, maybe or probably...

The fact is that we don't know what attacks might become known to the
public in the future or what attacks might be known (but not) publically
right now. IDEA is still relatively new.

So, you might want to hedge your bets by layering TDES and IDEA (or
something similar). In email/file transfer applications speed of the
symmetric cipher often isn't a big issue, so one can do something
like

IDEA with one key
followed by TDES with a second key
followed by IDEA with a third key

Probably overkill, but maybe not.

It goes to the first person willing to send me $5 for postage and trouble.

Tip:  After doing this once before, I have some advice.  If you read this
message more than a day after I wrote it, don't bother.  Someone has already
claimed it.  And don't expect a personal reply; if last time is any 
indication, I will be flooded with requests.  I only have one copy.

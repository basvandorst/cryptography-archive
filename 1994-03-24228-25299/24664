  It's always been my understanding that the entier purpose of the
patent system was to make inventions public.  Is there a special
national security clause in the patent law that allows "secret" patents.
It was my understanding that just the reverse was true.  If a patent
application relates to national security, the patent application was
kept secret, and the patent was withheld.

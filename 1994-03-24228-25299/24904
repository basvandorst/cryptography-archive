Yes, UNIX only uses the first 8 bytes of the password to form the key. It
is therefore conceivable that a machine be built with suficient storage
capacity to store a decoding matrix.

If the password has only lower case in it then you can store a lookup table
with every possible permutation in only 3Tb. 6Tb robot storage silos
are quite commonplace. The Ampex D2 one only needs 256 cassettes. 2000
cassette silos are quite common. 

To get round the salt you need 4096 times 3Tb. Sounds a lot today but 
it isn't at all really. Even with todays technology, eg optical tape in
a D2 cartridge a well funded agency could afford a machine with a complete
lookup. Remember that it is easier to provide read only storage than
read/write storage.

For the SSC there was a lot of research done into Petabyte stores. They
may have been unimaginable to the designers of UNIX in the 1970s but
today they are far from unimaginable. There will be at least one such
store built before 2002 to service the LHC experiments.

Assuming that the key has upper/lowercase does expand the field 
substantially of course. But then again a set of heuristics can be used
to narrow the field. Eg assume that there is only one shifted character
in the password. For anyone with access to that sort of technology it would
only be necessary to compromise a single account in order to compromise
the system.

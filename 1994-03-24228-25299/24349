One of the biggest markets for encryption is cellular phones,
to keep the radio link private, and if your cellphone provider isn't
using encryption on top of the Clipper, then it doesn't do you much good.
Sure, if you're talking to somebody else who also uses real encryption,
you can carry along your laptop and an accoustic coupler to plug your
cellphone into, but it ain't pocket-sized any more :-)

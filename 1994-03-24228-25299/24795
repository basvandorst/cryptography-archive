Disclaimer:  I'm not a lawyer but have had a class in export controls
that was taught by a former Asst. Sec. of Commerce for Export Controls. 
Talk to a real lawyer before writing any crypto-related code!

If the crypto element of the software you propose is based on knowledge
that you acquired while in the US or is provably derived from information
you have received from the US, the software and "technical data" (i.e.,
the knowledge of how to build such a product) is regulated under the
Commerce Control List and is subject to US export controls.  If you are
working with purely non-US data sources and *can prove* that you acquired
the knowledge required to build the crypto segment from non-US sources
then you are not in violation of US export controls.

The above paragraph is correct - the individual must prove that he/she is
in compliance with US export regulations!

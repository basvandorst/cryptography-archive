 Yup.  I had not seen it.

 Yes.  They are much weaker even than I had thought.

 OK, let's see some alternatives.

 Then we can itemize their strengths and weaknesses and put them
 in a design catalog.

 Fine by me.  96 8-bit substitutions means 256!^96 keys.

 (Obviously we initialize this state by shuffling with a
 cryptographic RNG, but we can make that RNG just as large as we
 want and seed it with all the key material we want.)

 Just the 32 substitutions in the middle would be more than secure,
 *provided* all the stuff around them spread their effects and
 prevented them from being attacked separately.

 All we need the mixings to do is to mix.  Essentially, we want to
 end up with the effect of a bit change in any particular position
 being spread among the entire output (statistically), after a set
 of mixings.  If this can be accomplished, we can use small,
 practical substitutions to make a large-block cipher.

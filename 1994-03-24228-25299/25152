I want to take several pairs of numbers and c0ompare them to find a
similar mathmatic operation that they may share.

Such as 756608 & 200624 or 732410 & 082232.   I wanted to do this in C but
my knoledge of C is severly lacking.

If I could be more clear on my objective, please tell me.  Thanks, Jason

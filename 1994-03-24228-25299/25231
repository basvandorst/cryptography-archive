        We seem so happy that RIPEM/SIG is now a commodity and therefore
a legal implementation of cryptoware.  But don't forget it's single key
algorithm is DES.  While the algorithm is probably secure, its use of 46
bit keys leaves all educated people uneasy.  Plans for DES brute force
attackers have been publish and for a price of $1,000,000 they could be
built and require only 3.5 hours per message.  Small investment by any
intelligence agency in any country.  When this fact is considered I
understand why RIPEM/SIG was given freedom.

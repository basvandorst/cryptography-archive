Just an interesting side note, If the security doesn't encrypt the
files/directory then an easy way to view the files is by using a utility such
as showfat which allows you to examine both the hex and ascii contents of
any/all files without worrying about directories etc. It works direct from the
fat and I haven't found any way of hiding things from it yet. If the file's
ascii all you need is to use this and a screen capture type thing.

There are a lot of books out there. The one most appropriate to the members
of this group is "A Course in Number Theory and Cryptography." By Koblitz 
(Springer-Verlag, 1987), but it is not an easy read and does not start 
out slow. If you want something that starts out really slooow, there's 
"Invitation to Number Theory", by Ore (The Mathematical Association of 
America, 1967; still in print). It is very elementary but it is extremely 
clear and does have a lot of good stuff in it. Among more advanced books 
on number theory, but still relatively easy to read, two good ones are 
"Number Theory and its History), by Ore, (Dover, 1976), and "Elementary 
Theory of Numbers" by LeVeque (Dover 1990). My final recommendation: a 
fun book is "The Little Book of Big Primes." by Ribenboim 
(Springer-Verlag, 1991). This book assumes some basic knowledge in number 
theory.

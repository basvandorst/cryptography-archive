Actually, the protocol you describe for key exchange might be
suceptible to a man in the middle attack...

The whole point of public keys is that you don't *send* them to
people, atleast not unverified or unencrypted, (unless you don't care
who it is you are sending them to, in which case, you don't gain much
from encryption (in theory, in practice you gain more trust)).

You broadcast them, you write them down in several ways and places,
you publish them, or checksums for them in telephone directories etc.
etc.

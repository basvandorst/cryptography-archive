You're ignoring the context of this discussion.  It all originated when
someone (definitely not a number theorist :-) ) who is obvious a Pascal
programmer was confused by the mathematical notation in a description
of RSA.  They had (I'm assuming) only seen "mod" as an operation over 
integers, as defined in a programming language such as Pascal (I know you've 
written programs, so this should be clear enough).  The second person, who 
you incorrectly corrected, was pointing out that the pascal "mod" (as an 
operator) is not the same thing as the mod n mathematical equivalence 
relation which was used in the RSA description.  They were drawing
exactly the kind of distinction that you would like to make --- that
in mathematical notation you almost always discuss mod as an equivalence
relation, which is *NOT* the same as the Pascal (or C) idea of "mod".

Now if you want to say that using "mod" in this way in Pascal is
a bad idea, I don't have any argument with that.  But don't correct the
person who was (correctly) pointing out the differences in the notations.

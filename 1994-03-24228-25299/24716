Colin James was quick on the trigger to fire off threatening messages
and cc them to my employer demanding retractions.  When the first
retraction wasn't good enough for him, he became even more threatening.

Now, I've verified that both versions of my total retraction got
through, but not a peep out of Colin James.  I guess he's better at
threatening than more polite forms of communication.

Perhaps James can describe exactly what it was about Jenkins' code that
infringes on his patent, so we won't have to guess.

I compresssed it because it has a big, ugly table that takes up hundreds
of lines (i.e., to save bandwidth).

That's not very nice without express permission.

And you complained about my disclaimer!  Your disclaimer is false,
so why even include it?

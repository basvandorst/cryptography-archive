If the network portion of the RSA-129 factorization project are near the 
end what does this mean?  Will PGP be expanded to increase security due 
to the fear that it does not protect well enough?  Or security concious 
people not be affected by by the results of this project?  The ability of 
a well organized networked factorization to achieve success will change 
how I think about the security we think we have in relation to the 
capabilities of the government.

"This topic" referred to what Mike said, not the topic (Subject) of the
thread. On that I've read most of the source documents--which are available
on the net by the way, not in the nearest library.

On Mike's topic there have been lots of posts making wild assertions of all
kinds. Until Mike gave me a pointer to the chapter in Schneier's book, I
wasn't aware he (Bruce) had treated it so well. Neither, obviously, were
many others who were posting on this topic in other newsgroups. That's why I
took it to this newsgroup recently--here's where we can find expertise.

Sure enough, it got clarified in a couple of days. That's a major value of
the net.

If one followed your implied advice and researched everything in the library
before posting, we wouldn't have discussion groups, but letters columns of
professional magazines. I don't think that's what most think the newsgroups
are for, judging by the contents.

The mechanism for getting newbies up to speed, by the way, isn't usually the
library but the newsgroup FAQ. Hopefully as a result of the discussion here
on key length vs. cracking costs, and the influence of brute force for IDEA,
xDES on this, vs factoring for RSA, the FAQ will be expanded with more
detail.

	Hi.  I looked through the faq, but couldn't find an answer
to this.  Maybe it's too dumb. :)
	So I have my sensitive text, and I encrypt it, but let's say
I'm paranoid that someone might break the encryption.  Why not encrypt
it again with a different key?  Or 3 times?  Or rot13 it, then encrypt
it backwards?  Etc...  I assume that there must be a good reason why
this is not worth the effort - maybe just another example of "security
through obscurity?"  Anyone have a simple explanation for this?
	Please respond via email or post, will post summaries upon
request.  Thanks,					-- Tim

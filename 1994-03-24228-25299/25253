Am I missing something? Isn't a one time pad generated from as "pure"
 random source as you can find?  Using a thing like one of the MD..
hashs, if they are secure in this application, and I don't
remember seeing any trustable soruce who says it defineitely is OK, to 
generate a keystream with it. Isn't using it in the way you indicate, just 
a conventional  key stream generator?. Perhaps ok for casual 
encryption (just like clipper would be).

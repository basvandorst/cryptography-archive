Thanks, but no thanks:

	I prefer not to use an encryption scheme tainted with the
	possibility of government influence.

	Using two encryption schemes, one for the file system and
	one for back-ups, means that breaking either one breaches
	the system.

A container file would be a simple way to solve the back-up problem. 
Somebody else pointed out Rawdisk, which will make any physical disk
area appear as a file.  That would work, although it is somewhat
inconvenient to determine the appropriate cylinder boundaries.

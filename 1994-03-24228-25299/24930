I use a method which yields pretty cryptic passwords:

	Using a foreign language that you're familiar with, fabricate
	a word having a plausible syllabic pattern (to make it easy
	to memorize).  For example, from Farsi I might fake the word
	"GHarqOt".

	Then, type the word on a Qwerty keyboard using the Dvorak
	keymapping (this requires that you know Dvorak).

	The password becomes: UJaoxSk

The only hitch is that you have to memorize two versions of the
password:  one for Dvorak on Qwerty, and one for Dvorak on Dvorak.

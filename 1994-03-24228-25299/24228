   The entire transmission is probably hash/checksumed etc to make
   modifications impossible to slip throgh. 

The wiretap block (excuse me, Law Enforcement Access Field :-)
includes a checksum so the receiving chip can validate that it came
from a real Clipper chip, and the field is used as part of the
initialization vector for the block-chaining algorithm, so if it
doesn't start with the real wiretap block, it won't decrypt right,
and you'll only receive garble.

On the other hand, if your phone *were* programmable, and both you and
your co-conspirator had reprogrammed phones, you could do something like
XOR the wiretap block with a shared key on both ends, which makes it
useless for eavesdroppers but restores it to original form before decryption.
That's why the so-called Escrowed Encryption Standard FIPS that just
came out says that standards-conforming phones can't post-encrypt the field.

Of course, if the cellphone industry is bullied into adopting Clipper,
they will presumably use it in standard form for the radio link,
so even if you had a programmable phone it wouldn't do you any good to
reprogram it.

I was hoping that when the NIST released their FIPS standard for Escrowed
Encryption, it would have reasonably generic, purely technical, wording 
that someone could abuse by designing a conforming implementation but
not delivering the keys to the feds, giving them to the users to
escrow instead.  (Disgusting to even cooperate that much, I realize.) 
No such luck - it's a bogus document that says "all the useful
technical details are classified, go ask the NSA, here are their names" 
without even a pretense of technical usefulness like an example set of
key, plaintext, and cyphertext data you could use to test your Clipper
chip in ECB mode.   Oh, well.

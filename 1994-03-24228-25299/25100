I'm not sure if I understand your comment "You can't substantiate a negative".
Whether a statement is "positive" or "negative" depends on how you phrase it.
If what you had in mind is that you can't prove an assertion about non-
existence (of cryptanalytic means) by enumeration, your comment is correct,
but a bit off the point.  Proof by enumeration works only for assertions of
existence but not assertions of non-existence.

One way you can reason about the security of a cryptosystem is that you
assume the cryptosystem is breakable, and from this assumption derive a
contradiction to some known facts or accepted assumptions.  You can think
of the security of one-time pads as an assertion of non-existence of
cryptanalytic algorithms.  If you do that, a proof of the security of OTP
already "substantiates a negative".

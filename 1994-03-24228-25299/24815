I was under the impression that the S box selection had been shown to be
good (compared to other plausible S box selections) against differential
attacks.  Differential cryptanalysis was only described in the public
media some time after DES was released.  It is supposed that the NSA (et
al) knew about differential attacks, and designed DES to be better
against them than it might otherwise have been.  This could not have
been published without making the attack --- presumably valid for other
cypher systems --- generally known.

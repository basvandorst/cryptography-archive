Having actually contacted Ascom Tech AG, I can state that the license
fee is a one-off fee which entitles you to C source code for the IDEA
algorithm, which you can then use without paying royalties in any
number of copies of your product.

This is part of the reason why PKP and Phil Zimmermann didn't get on.
PKP wanted Phil to pay a huge one-time fee in order to distribute PGP.
That kind of arrangement just isn't on for shareware or freeware.
Fortunately, Ascom Tech are more understanding, and allow shareware
and freeware implementations of IDEA (not based on their source) to be
distributed and used without license fees being required.

Er, yes.  They do it all the time.  Microsoft spent a huge amount of
money developing Word; millions of people use Word commercially in
order to make money, without paying any share of that money to
Microsoft.  They just pay a one-off payment for the right to use the
software.  It's exactly the same with IDEA.  The patent licensing
merely ensures that part of the one-off development cost goes to Ascom Tech
for the part they played in the development.

Not that I'm terribly keen on software patents in general, but in this
particular case the terms seem reasonable.

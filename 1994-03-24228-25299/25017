In the USA, you are in a much stronger position than bank customers in Europe.
In 1980, the case Judd v Citibank set a precedent; Dorothy Judd said she hadn't 
made some transactions which appeared on her statement, and Citibank said that
she must have done. In the judge's opinion, Citibank's claim that its systems
were infallible was no defence, and unacceptable in law because it put an
unmeetable burden of proof on the plaintiff (435 NYS, 2nd Series, 107 Misc.2d 
526 pp 210 - 212).

This has since been incorporated by the Federal Reserve into industry
regulations. Its `Regulation E', which covers electronic banking, states that
when a customer disputes an ATM transaction, the bank must either prove that
the complaint is an attempted fraud or refund the money wthin 30 days.

Surprise, surprise. VISA regulations state that PIN encryption must be
performed in approved secure hardware, so that no bank employee will ever
have access to a live customer PIN. Yet

(1)	Most US banks don't bother with secure hardware - they flout the
	regulations and encrypt in software instead. This means that the
	bank's programmers can get hold of the keys and work out PINs

(2)	Even in the UK, where secure hardware is the norm, many things go
	wrong with the operational and management aspects. For example,
	in August 1993 my wife went into one of the big four UK banks and
	said she'd forgotten her PIN. The branch staff helpfully printed
	out a new PIN mailer from a PC they had behind the counter. This
	was despite the fact that the branch wasn't the one where her account
	is kept; the staff didn't know her and the only ID she produced was
	her cash card and a cheque book. This was despite the fact that a 
	large class action had given rise to some eighteen months' press 
	publicity about phantom withdrawals, and that this publicity had 
	recently been targetted directly at my wife's bank.

As noted above, VISA doesn't enforce its own security regualtions. WHy should
they? They don't pay for the fraud, but they do get a fee per transaction. The
moral hazard is clear.

If you want to know more about how ATM fraud is carried out, see my article
`Why Cryptosystems Fail' in Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Computer and
Communications Security, Nov 3-5, 1993, Fairfax, VA pp 215 - 227. There will
be an abridged version in Communications of the ACM later this year.

Go straight to the Federal Reserve - unlike VISA they are quite keen on 
enforcing their regulations. 

America is in fact one of the few countries in the world where bent bank staff 
regularly go to jail - this is thanks to the Fed, the SEC, the FBI and other 
Federal bodies. In fact over 3500 bank officials got prosectuted last year, and 
96% were convicted, compared with a trivial number in Europe.

Every detail you ca tell me will be ammunition to help other people in similar
trouble, of whom there are plenty all round the world.

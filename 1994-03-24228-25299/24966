Assumed knowledge David: 128 bits can encode 3.4028237E38 combinations. 
Ergo, if you try to exhaust a key space of 128 bits you will have to 
check up to that many keys. (To the 99% confidence level, not less than 
3.4028237E36 combinations will have to be checked).

If I move to a 256 bit key, it becomes 1.15790892E77 combinations 
(3.4028237E38 squared). Key space searches become prohibitive VERY fast. 
For the price of doubling my key length, I SQUARE the key space.

This is why "superduper" cracking machines become worthless for any 
reasonable key length. It costs me MUCH less computationally to expand my 
key length than it costs you to search the newly expanded key space.

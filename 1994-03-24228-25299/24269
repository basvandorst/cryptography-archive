					 PUSH FOR SURVEILLANCE SOFTWARE

							  Times:New York-NY
																02/28/94

In an interview last Friday, Louis Freeh, the head of the FBI, stated that
in the age of computer communications and digital telephone calls, the
American people must be willing to give up a degree of personal privacy in
exchange for safety and security. Mr. Freeh had defended proposed
legislation that many say would turn the nation's telephone network into a
vast surveillance system. The Clinton Administration is trying to gain
Congressional support for the legislation, called the Digital Telephony
and Communications Privacy Improvement Act of 1994, before it is formally
introduced. Many critics feel that having taxpayers rather than
communications companies pay for the system is a way to dilute industry
criticism of the plan. Taxpayers would be asked to pay approximately half
a billion dollars for the development and deployment of the necessary
network software.

I find this frightening.

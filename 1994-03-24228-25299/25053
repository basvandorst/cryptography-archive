None of which are actually necessary.  The distribution header does not
restrict transfer of messages between news servers, it provides a selection
mechanism which administrators *may or may not* choose to use to limit the
amount of traffic they get.

Anyone who thinks that setting the distribution to US means that the article
will not be available outside the US is a fool.  Since I doubt that Bruce
is a fool I conclude it was intended as a sly dig at ITAR...

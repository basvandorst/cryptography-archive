Whilst on this subject I also think that if you have an echo/noecho
option then the noecho should echo _nothing_, not even asterisks. If
someone knows your passphrase is 8 characters long then they know they
have try all 8 character combinations, starting with everything in
every dictionary they have. This is a big reduction in effort from
having to try all 1,2,3,4,5... character passphrases.

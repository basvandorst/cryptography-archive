Yes, I meant n instead of b --- sorry for the typo.

This is where you keep getting confused.  I meant the = sign, and others
meant the equal sign (as in equals over the integers, *NOT* as an equivalence
relation mod n or as equals over Z/nZ).  You are the one who is reinterpreting 
it.  We are using mod in this case to mean a binary *operator*, it is *NOT* 
an equivalence relation mod n.  As an operator (mod as a function ZxZ->Z),
4 mod 3 = 1.  Period.  Yes, 1 is equivalent to 7 mod 3, but that is *NOT*
relevant to what anyone is saying here....  The operation 4 mod 3 has the 
unique integer answer 1.  Can I be more clear?  :-)

I certainly wouldn't argue about that, but I'm trying to point out that
you misinterpretted the original posters message when you said he was
wrong.  In fact, he was right --- it is the notation that is confusing, but
it is fairly common, and I think most people knew what he meant.

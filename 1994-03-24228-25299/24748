If it were illegal to publish messages from others (or what is probably
intended, some kind of copyright infringment), then how could there exist
books consisting only of the correspondence of famous people?  If the
letters in such books were only written by the famous person and sent only
to the famous person, the books would be called diaries, wouldn't they?

It obviously is not at all polite to publish private messages, so a more
forthright statement is "do not send me any email."  Who could possibly
object to such a request?

Mr. James' generally hostile and defensive tone suggests that he has not
garnered much respect or admiration from his patent.  That is mildly good
news for software patents.  One can hope that such social pressure will
eventually ensure that most people who file patents are not knowledgable
and/or smart enough to meet even the patent office's minimal standards,
limiting if not fixing the software patent mess.

   The major point I'd emphasize here is that it takes a *lot* more
time, money, and risk to do TEMPEST surveilance than to simply do quiet
listening in on the wire.  So far as I know, it generally requires
some expensive equipment, and a listening post or two near where you
use your computer.  Probably, it's only partially successful at best
(random interference would likely be a problem), though I'm not an
expert on it.  More importantly, if it takes time, effort, money, and
risk (in terms of more people being involved, or in terms of having
to dress up like a phone company employee or something to put the
listening gear in a good place, or whatever), then it's going to be
done only for a few people.  Remember that the NSA has the Russians,
Israelis, Chinese, French, Mexicans, Japanese, etc., to try to eaves-
drop on.  The FBI has any suspected or known foreign spies, mobsters,
dope lords, and possibly political enemies of the President to surveil.
How many agent-hours and dollars are your PGP-protected love letters to
your girlfriend *honestly* worth to these folks?  My suspiscion is that
if you're in a position to be faced with surveilance from any such
organizations, you know it.  Now this is *not* to say that TEMPEST
attacks can only be done by the pros, or than regular citizens shouldn't
worry about their security.  However, I don't think that most people,
most of the time, have major reasons to fear TEMPEST surveilance.  And
I'd guess that anything that can make TEMPEST surveilance harder (more
interference-generating electronic equipment, a laptop you move around
in your house or office a lot, lots of nearby telephone or power lines,
etc.) add to the cost and difficulty of successful attacks.  (This is
probably especially true of TEMPEST attacks from someone other than
an intelligence agency or other really well-funded and technically
competent organization.)

   Afterthought:
 
   I'd like to see some thoughts/comments from anyone who understands the
TEMPEST-type attacks better than I do.  I'd bet IBM's crypto devices are
resistant to it, and I wonder if they've classified their design notes
to those devices....

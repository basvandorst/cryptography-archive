128 bits of IDEA key or 112 bits of TDES key are not comparable to 
a similarly sized RSA key.  A 128 bit RSA modulus would be trivial
to factor.  With a 1024 bit RSA key and 128 bit IDEA key PGP is 
probably secure for the time being, although there are undoubtedly
those who would argue that the RSA key is still the weakest point
for an attack.

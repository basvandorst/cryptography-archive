One might, but since State was ruling on a book, and made it clear the
ruling didn't cover the disks, it still seems an open question at best. You
used the phrase "PGP source" without specifying the form in which it was
fixed--a book, disk, etc. Recall that PGP (non-Viacrypt) contains assertedly
infringing code in the U.S. and may be derived from copyright matter outside
the U.S. It's hard to imagine that an infringer can legalize that
infringement by publishing it, or that a copyright violator becomes "legal"
by the very act of violating that copyright--publication.

It would be good to have an expert (not you or I, obviously) opinion on this
matter, since it's an area where proof by assertion or proof by opinion has
no standing with a court.

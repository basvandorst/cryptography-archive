   We are working with swIPe here at MITRE(security at the ip network
layer). We got the basic code working and now we are including
Diffie-Hellman key exchange. Key-exchange is a protocol in itself and
before we get mired into design and implementation of a protocol from
scratch we'd like to know if its been done before or written about or
both. So here is the question:

  Are there any existing key-exchange protocols or is there anybody
out there working on key-exchange?


  Note I am looking for implementation level detail type stuff ie
given that we have datagram communication do we calculate first before we 
a rekey to our partner? How do we determine who is the "master"
and who is the "slave"? Do we use a two phase commit?

  Its not that we are lazy, I'd love to work on this stuff its just that
we are underfunded and pressed for time

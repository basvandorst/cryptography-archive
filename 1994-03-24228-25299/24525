A ring is like a field in the sense that both have an operation,
usually referred to as addition, and another operation which is
usually called multiplication.

The difference is in the multiplication.  In a field, the
multiplication is commutative, so a*b = b*a always, and every non-zero
element (that is every element except the additive identity) has a
multiplicative inverse (reciprocal if you like).  In a ring neither of
these have to happen.

So every field is a ring, but every ring is not a field.

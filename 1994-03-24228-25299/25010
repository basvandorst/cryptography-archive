You can usually get a cellular phone from your BOC (Bell Operating
Company...your local phone company) by just supplying your local
phone number.

After you have this phone, you can usually get an account with a
non-BOC by supplying your then-existing cellular number.

All this without compromising your SSN.  (Besides, BOC's usually
provide better cellular service as well as not compromising your
privacy on their applications.)

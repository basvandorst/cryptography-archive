Please do us all a favor. Go read up on a subject before posting about it.
Your statement "congruence is *stronger* than mod" is meaningless nonsense.
A congruence between two numbers modulo a third is an equivalence relation
between them. Saying congruence is stronger than mod is like saying blue
is stronger than sheep. Congruence is not an operator. Mod is.

:1) a mod b = r   implies   a [congruent] r (mod n)
 
It doesn't "imply". It is merely different notation for the same thing.

:   e.g. 12 mod 5 = 2	=> 	12 [congruent] 2 (mod5)
:
:but
:
:2) a [congruent] b (mod n)   if and only if   a mod n = b mod n
 
So? All you are saying (in effect) is "foo equiv foo".  Your "but"
between the two statements above implies there is some difference between
them.  12 equiv 2 mod 5  MEANS  12 mod 5 equiv 2 mod 5. Your "but" is irrelevent
and misleading.

:   e.g. 12 [congruent] 7 (mod5), i.e. 12-7 = k x 5 (k=1), but 12 mod 5 = 7
:   is false; it is true that  12 mod 5 = 7 mod 5 , so you have to be
 
You are seriously confused.  12 mod 5 equiv 7 is most certainly true. 7 and 12
are in the same equivalence class mod 5.

:   careful if b > n
 
You are confusing equality and equivalence.
a = b mod p  is an equivalence relation, not an equality.

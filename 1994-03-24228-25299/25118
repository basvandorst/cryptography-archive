I think that I might have heard about a program that works as a shell, 
calling PGP with parameters collected through a traditional windows user 
interface.  I'm not sure about that, though.  You might want to check the 
PGP faq.

I *don't* think it would be a good idea to turn PGP into a real windows 
program, though.  I'd always be worried about what had been written to my 
swap file (private keys w/o the idea encryption, etc.)

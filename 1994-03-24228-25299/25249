I've created a newsgroup and I'm currently moderating another (though my
duties with the latter end at Easter). I'll see if I can come up with a
draught charter though I'm probably going to be fairly busy for the next
couple of weeks.

It would be useful if we could first come to a consensus on the name of
the new group (s.c.research or s.c.theory?) and the who will moderate it
(I'm the only one to have volunteered so far).

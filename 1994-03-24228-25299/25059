This is confusing:
Brute force key-space search is the fastest way to break symmetric
key cryptosystems such as 3DES or IDEA. (3DES with two keys has
a 112 bit key, IDEA has a 128 bit key).

This is not the fastest way to break RSA, however. Rather, it
is faster to factor the modulus. Factoring a 128 bit number
is much much faster than enumerating all possible 128 bit numbers,
in fact it's a rather modest task. That's why RSA keys must
be much longer than 128 bits to be secure. I believe that
to achieve a comparable level of security with RSA (to IDEA) given
currently known factoring techniques, it is necessary to
have a key something like 3000 bits long.

However, 1024 bit keys should be secure for quite some time.
I invite you to check out Rivest's estimates in the first
volume of Ciphertext for key length-cost computations.

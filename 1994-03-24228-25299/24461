I'd like to install a challenge-response system for remote logging
into my workstation.  Unfortunately, I may be logging in from a
dumb terminal.  So, I'm thinking of using a 5-function calculator
to implement a secret function.  E.g., the workstation sends me
'123', I surround that with '7's: 71236, take the sqrt: 266.9026,
and return the first 3 decimals: 902.

How large is my keyspace?  How many different secret functions can
I easily implement?  What are some good classes of functions?  The
bad guys may be watching my line for some time to gather
challenges and responses, to analyze.

I prefer email responses, and will post a condensed form of them.
Thanks.

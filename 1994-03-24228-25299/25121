This is a fine point. I think that what NSA is saying by
'computer-security systems that the government's encryption keys
couldn't unlock' is that the entire protocol, with LEAF et. al.,
could be spoofed if the crypt algorithm were known. e.g., if they
used 3DES, the system would quickly fall to interlopers, and there
would be no LEBI (Law-Enforcement Barge-In).

btw, I don't trust the NSA either. I hope IDEA turns out OK....

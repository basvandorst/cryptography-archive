   Hey, is it OK for a US citizen to log onto a site into the UK and run

If by "OK" you mean "is it outside the US government's jurisdiction",
then, yes, it's OK; if the other US citizen also runs their PGP
outside the US borders.  On the other hand, if by "OK" you mean
"Is it a good idea to ship sensitive material like files you might
want to encrypt or PGP passphrases across the world on unencrypted
telnet it hopes of making it secure on the far end?" then, no, 
it's not a real bright idea :-)

   Is it OK to print C source of, say, PGP in an OCR-friendly form, and
   export it with a program on floppy that's especially good at reading
   that OCR-friendly text?  If so, is the law an ass, or what?

As far as I can tell, it appears to be OK, though courts will often
rule whatever the prosecutors tell them to in cases like this,
and yes, the law appears to be an ass about this area.
On the other hand, I'm an anarchist, so I'm not likely to be caught
saying laws are a good idea :-)

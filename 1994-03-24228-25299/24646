Peter Boucher:

   cjames@nyx.cs.du.edu (Colin James III (The Rt Rev'd)) has informed me
   that Jenkins' PRNG source code infringes on US Patent No 5_251_165,
   "Two phase random number generator" which issued 10/5/93.

does anyone who has seen the patent know if L'Ecuyer's [1] combined
generators, or generators from Santha and Varizani [2] or Marsaglia
and Bray "shuffle" [3] would infringe on the sensibilities of Colin
James III patent?

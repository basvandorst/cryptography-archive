That's exactly what David said in his original post.  I don't think  
anybody is debating that.  The issue is do you feel the government has  
some insidious purpose in all of this.  I don't believe so.  The  
government has been developing secure voice systems for years.  This is  
the first offering to the general public.  If you don't like the idea of  
government accessible secure voice, don't buy it.  The wave of apathy that  
sweeps though the government should be monumental.

I'm not a 'virus fan', I'd really very much prefer that they didn't exist.

I (and others) aren't too keen on PK's '-AV authentication'.  It is
allegedly poorly implemented, and gives users a false sense of security
that an archive has not been tampered with or forged.  My objective in
looking at it is to quantify the problem, publish an 'advisory', and kick
PKWare into either producing something secure or dropping it.

I don't remember that, though you clearly enjoyed it.

   Did someone in the US pass his message, or a report of it to you?
   If not, can you read "usa only" Distribution messages?
   If so, this suggests a weakness in the net's news distribution mechanisms
   that might be worth exploring.
   Technical comments only in return, thanks.


I can't sy how Graham read the message, but I can think of several
mechanisms by which he may have seen it.

1) A nntp server somewhere in the US accepts clients from anywhere.

2) A mosaic <-> news interface on a machine somewhere in the US
accepts clients from anywhere.

3) He has an account on a machine in the US and read it from that
account.

4) At least one nntp server in the US ignores the usa distribution
restriction.

5) Some nntp server administrator changed the usa distribution to world
by hand.

6) Someone in the US mailed it to him, as you suggest might have
happened.

7) Someone outside the US read it by some means, possibly one or more
of 1) to 5) and then passed it on to him.


There are doubtless many other mechanisms by which Graham could have
read the article.

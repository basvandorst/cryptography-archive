I think so.  Let me plug my own.  My program solves several American
Cryptogram Association ciphers, or perhaps better stated provides a nice
solving environment.  The ciphers are
	simple substitution with proper word divisions (Aristocrats)
	complete columnar transpositions
	route transpositions
	railfence (but not redefence)	
	bifids (5x5, 6x6, and twins, but not conjugated matrix)
These are completely harmless puzzle ciphers that we solve just for fun.
My program also is just for fun, and free.  It can't be exported though.	
It runs on the PC, MS-DOS.

I cannot remember if it appeared in sci.crypt, but recently there was discussion
about the law people getting access to billing records so they could see
where you phoned even if they couldn't get a tap order to find out
what you said.

The way around this problem is to find a forwarding service that would forward 
your calls on, so that you called them only, and some random time later they
passed on your call. If enough people used this service at a time, it would not
be possible to work out who was calling who...

It has its problems ( you have to trust the third party).

You coould also use voice mail via a forwarder, or just use email...

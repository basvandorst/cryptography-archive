If this were true, it could still be that RSA/DES/TDES/IDEA would offer
more PRACTICAL security than CLIPPER. If the government could break
RSA/DES/TDES/IDEA, it would be held as a very closely guarded state
secret. The government would wish to save the secret that they could
break the code for use against foreign governments and/or terrorists.
The Time honored way to keep such a secret is to let VERY few persons
know about it. Every time the government used its ability to break the code
to address a practical problem, it creates some evidence of its ability to
break the code. (The evidence is the fact that the government addressed the
problem successfully, when it should have not been able to, if the code was 
unbroken.) I believe that the government would be unwilling to create such
evidence for anything less than a very important National Security Issue.
The ordinary drug-pusher/pornographer/tax avoision practitioner should be 
safe. The police or prosecutor in such a case would probably not even be 
told the straight sorry on whether the government could break the code.

On the other hand, consider CLIPPER. Everyone will know that the government
can decode CLIPPER, so there is no secret to protect. The government can
freely decode everything, (either using a secret decryption algorithm, or
secret copies of the "escrowed" keys ) and if is ever discovered that they
decoded something they should not have been able to, they can either
backdate an order to release of the escrowed key, or assign some 
government employee to be a fall guy for "illegally" releasing an escrow key.

Thus even if the government can break RSA/DES/TDES/IDEA,
and can not break CLIPPER (without release of an "escrow" key),
it could still be safer in the real world to use RSA/DES/TDES/IDEA.

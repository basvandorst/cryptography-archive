The "Americans" and the "Delphoids",
<greggman@aol.com> + <greggman@delphi.com> say, to me,
"I am considering devising a Windows front-end for PGP..." but no, they
can't do it say I, for the PGP PHAK itself they did not read. Then how they
might one day codify a front-end for I to trust my thoughts with? Do we
seek Windows PGP times three, for two not be fair? Barclay and ViaCrypt
require, the obligatory, the missing, the dream. The commercial during
a SuperBowl. Yet then somehow, not dozens, but hundreds of empty
inquiring minds who wish to know the story of Windows PGP, would knock on
the doors of our little newsgroups, pestering us, asking us, demanding of
us the same tired answers. "Has Windows PGP been done?".

...and the sea the sea crimson sometimes like fire and the glorious
 sunsets and the figtrees in the Alameda gardens yes and all the queer
 little streets and the pink and blue and yellow houses and the rosegardens
 and the jessamine and geraniums and cactuses and Gibraltar as a girl where
 I was a Flower of the mountain yes when I put the rose in my hair like
 the Andalusian girls used or shall I wear a red yes and how he kissed me
 under the Moorish wall and I thought well as well him as another and then
 I asked him with my eyes to ask again yes and then he asked me would I
 yes to say yes my mountain flower and first I put my arms around him yes
 and drew him down to me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes and
 his heart was going like mad and yes I said yes I will Yes.

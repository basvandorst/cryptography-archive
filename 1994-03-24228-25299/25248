Yes, well we all should know that Paul Zimmerman and Mike Riordan are 
part of a conspiracy to get us all to use bogus encryption techniques 
so that the NSA can read all of our messages. Note also, that your 
TV set is a transmitter, and that the FBI can see what goes on in 
your living room. Next every person in the world will be implanted 
with a microchip which will identify them and transmit their thoughts 
to the NSA for recording. People with "untruthful" thoughts will be 
arrested and "freed" from their misconceptions using a new reprogramming
technique developed by the CIA. All the world governments are cooperating
on this, so that the world can eventually be unified under ONE WORLD
GOVERNMENT ruled by the Antichrist and his minions.

But seriously...

1. RIPEM uses triple DES or DES (at the user's option). If you know 
of a practical attack against triple DES encrypted messages, please 
share it with us. 

2. DES has a 56 bit key.

3. RIPEM/SIG doesn't do encryption. It is a special version of RIPEM 
without the encryption code.

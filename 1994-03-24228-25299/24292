It's easier than that. Use an old 1A2 key system. Replace the
400[D,F,G,H] card with a SanBar 4001. The 4001 lifts both T+R when
there is no A-control. But it detects ringing so your local 30 hz
generator can ring your set. The problem is, you have no
'power-failure' mode. With no A-relay closure, you get no dialtone.

I once saw a security hookswitch the folks in the 5-sided
building had dreamed up. When on-hook it:
	broke both T+R
	Shorted the set side of T+R together
	shorted the receiver (SOP)
	Had A-control (SOP)
	Opened (i.e. in series) the transmitter loop.
I wondered if the handsets had the cotton removed and cement
added to be sure they were heavy enough to work it. ;-}

This is the definition of "a mod b" which I (as a mathematician) 
am used to:

For b any nonzero integer, let R = {0,1,2,...,|b|-1}.

(we could call this the "standard" complete set of residues mod b).

For any integer a, the equivalence class of a, in mod b arithmetic, 
contains exactly one representative in R. Define "a mod b" to be this
unique integer. (This is line with the comp sci definition as the remainder
when divided by b, as long as remainders are required to be non-negative).


Thus me may talk both about equivalence and equality without problems :

i.e. a mod b = c means that the unique representative of a's equivalence
class, in mob b arithmetic, which falls in the standard complete set of
residues, is (equal to) c.


So, when Vesna said that 12 mod 5 is not equal to 7 (but rather 2),
she was merely noting that "(a mod b) is equal to c" is a stronger statement 
than "a is congruent to c (mod b)" since the former restricts c to be in
the set R (assuming we work with the above definitions).

(I agree however, that to say "congruence is *stronger* than mod", is 
somewhat meaningless, especially since "mod" is used in both the above
statements; even if we assume that in Vesna's claim "mod" means the mod
operator I would have expected her to say "mod is *stronger* than 
congruence")

Any comments, Vesna ? 
Any arguments, Bob ?

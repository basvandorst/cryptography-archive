I had look at NIST's ftp site last month, collected the index & some
directory listings.  The directory listing included several FIPS
publications (in the nistpubs directory), one of them was fips181.txt

I went back last weekend to collect some files that looked potentially
interesting, fips181.txt was one of them - *but* it had vanished!

I'm looking for pointers to encryption methods, papers, or network
resources (ftp sites, WWW pages, etc) dealing with algorithmic complexity
and how it relates to cryptography. All aspects such as key generation,
encryption, decrytion, attack, theoretical underpinnings (ie, NP-hardness
coming into play when trying to attack).

Can anyone suggest cryptographic methods which have features that make them
relate to algorithmic complexity in an interesting way? I am especially
interested in systems which pit the attacker against NP-hardness.
But pointers to papers with commentary on the complexity of algorithms
or comparions, etc would also be greatly welcomed.

PG

   Hmmm.  At first glance, it seems like consistently having each subkey
depend on only half the key bits would introduce some weaknesses to
the cipher in terms of allowing attacks with less than 2**112 complexity.
I can't see any off the top of my head, but it just seems like a bad
idea....
 
   Why not invest some serious time and effort in a redesign of the key
scheduling for DES, so that we can extend it to a 32-round cipher with
a keysize that is close to the real strength of the cipher, in terms of
resistance to differential attacks?  My immediate approach would be to
use the approach of Merkle in his Khufu design:  Generate the subkeys
by encrypting the key over and over again, in CBC mode, with a pre-set
key.  For example, set the "key-scheduling" subkeys equal to the first
32*48 bits in the binary expansion of pi, and then generate each subkey
by continually encrypting a (say) 80 bit key under the key-scheduling
subkeys.
 
   At least, this would make each subkey dependent on 64 bits, derived
directly from all 80 bits of key.  Of course, this would need some
careful review before it would be sufficient....

Both books are very good but address different purposes.
Simmons' book is a collection of academic articles, some of them
a bit dated now.  It has a lot of theoretical and historical
information, not that much about programming techniques.
Schneier's book is more nuts and bolts, intended for practical
cryptography users.  It contains a lot of info about actual
cryptographic devices and programs that are on the net or
the market now, in addition to explaining the techniques.
However, it does not go into theoretical issues as deeply
as Simmons' book.

I'd say as a first book, definitely get Schneier's.
Simmons's is for when you're already pretty knowledgeable.

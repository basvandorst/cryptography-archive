While there are no guarantees, you might lessen the overflow problem by
finding GCDs of the a's and the b's, and dividing them out (making sure to
use the divid numbers in subsequent steps.

You would get a1' and b1' by finding GCD(a1,b1) and dividing a1 and b1 by it.
Then you'd get a1'' and b2' by finding GCD(a1',b2) and dividing a1' and b2 by
it.  And so on.

If you get a substantial size on the GCDs, you may be able to do the division.

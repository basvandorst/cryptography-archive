Okay, I've really been enjoying this tour-de-force of what we math-pukes 
used to call abuse of notation, but Messrs. So et al are correct.  Just to 
diffuse this tense standoff, I 
remember back in the late seventies, when the formal Pascal specification 
was making its way around the schools, that Niklaus Wirth (or one of that 
crowd) was busy soothing mathematicians' ruffled feathers over the MOD 
operator.  I seem to recall that he claimed it was a holdover from the 
Algol language;  anyway, the American Math. Soc. was quite incensed that 
mere computer scientists were diddling with the sacred modulo notation 
which would undoubtedly confuse the hell out of a whole generation of math
majors (they lost their case when CS majors started making more money).

But _long_ before that, according to Adm. Grace Hopper, they were complaining 
about the fact that "=" in COBOL really meant assignment and not 
equality and should be expressed with the "<--" symbol.  Given that 
COBOL was a BUSINESS language, the grand old dame of computing would have 
none of it, and said something rather terse to the AMS president.

So here we are in sci.crypt mixing up equivalences, equalities, assignments 
and remainders-- well, at least we're in stellar company!  ;-)

Actually, this scenario was discussed in Bruce Schneir's  book "Applied
Cryptograph".  He suggested giving pieces of the key to a group of
employees.  This way no one employee has the key except the one responsible
for the data.  If that employee becomes unavailable, then managment can
call in all of the key fragments and re-create the key.  This, of course,
only works with certain encryption algorithm and sufficiently large key
lengths.

BTW:  I highly recommend the book.

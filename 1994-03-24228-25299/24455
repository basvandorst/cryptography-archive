I've been doing a bit more reading on this subject.

It turns out that the three round scheme (f1, f1, f2), where f1 and f2
are random functions, was proved by Ohnishi in his Master's thesis to
be indistinguishable from a random permutation.  This means that if
DES were a truly random function, three rounds of ladder DES with the
first two rounds having identical keys would be adequate.  The trouble
is that DES isn't a truly random function, so Ohnishi's result doesn't
necessarily apply.  However, it's a good starting point.

Andrew.

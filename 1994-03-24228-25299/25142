It depends on whether the IDEA algorithm/key for encrypting each individual
message is broken, or whether the RSA algorithm/key for passing individual
message keys is broken.

If the first, one would have to mount pretty much the same effort on each
message. If the second, all past/present/future messages using the same
public/private key pair fall out trivially. That's why it's a good idea to
revoke your old keys and generate new ones regularly. The frequency depends
on how long you think it would take to crack the RSA portion, vs. how long
the information in the messages would be useful to an adversary.

Remember, though, that most cracking involves a probability distribution.
That is--even if it would take a year to crack, some keys will fall out a
lot sooner.

We haven't discussed this before, but an interesting question is how this
entire security discussion would play if an adversary had a strategy of
trying to crack a lot of different people's messages, but would allow his
cracking machines to run for only a month on each one before dropping it.
Then calculations become a lot more complicated, since whether your traffic
is cracked or not becomes probabilistic rather than deterministic, and the
issue becomes more whether, than when.

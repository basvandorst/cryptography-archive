Well, if you have 26 uppercase + 26 lowercase + 24 characters of
~!@#$%^&*()_+|\=-`,.<>/?;':"[]{} + 10 digits, you have 94 characters.
15 instances of this set yield 395E27. (I simply grabbed the special
characters off my keyboard, and may be short a few.... (or long,
for that matter))
DES's keyspace is 2^56, or 72E15. IDEA's keyspace is 2^128, or
340E36. Your 15 random characters are more than enough for DES, but
(strictly speaking) not as large a keyspace as IDEA's.
If I could remember a 15-character random passphrase like
!---fkZ4O\Ieq@` I'd feel really really secure.

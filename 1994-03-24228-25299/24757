Shortly after posting the following excerpt from pgpdoc2.txt,
I received a letter from Philippe Baumann, the licensing manager
for IDEA at Ascom-Tech AG.

"There is no
 license fee required for noncommercial use of IDEA.  Ascom Tech AG
 has granted permission for PGP to use the IDEA cipher, and places no
 restrictions on using PGP for any purpose, including commercial use."
                                 (14-Jun-93 ed)
  
M. Baumann informs me that this statement is incorrect. In particular,
he stated that commercial users of PGP must have a license for IDEA
from Ascom-Tech AG.

M. Baumann writes (in part).
"We have never given permission to use IDEA(TM) in PGP for commercial
purposes. If you want to use in your office PGP (including IDEA)
you can by the commercial version from ViaCrypt. They have an IDEA
License and they have the right to sell PGP to commercial users."

[M. Baumann has requested that I post this correction and kindly
given permission to cite his e-mail.]

I wish to stress that ViaCrypt PGP users are completely in the clear,
because ViaCrypt has obtained a license for IDEA. Presumably,
though, non-US PGP users must make their own arrangements with
IDEA. (I assume that any US PGP users who aren't using ViaCrypt
aren't worried about patent violations, since it is already
a well known fact that PKP claims that PGP infringes on patents
on RSA.)

Sorry about the screw up folks.

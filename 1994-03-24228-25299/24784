About a month or so ago, somebody posted here about why it was more secure
to triple encrypt each block of data, and the performing the CBC operation
on this block, as opposed to using a separate IV for each stage of DES
encryption.  Can someone please repost the reason?

It's not intuitively obvious that using a single IV would be more secure
than using three different, independent ones, especially if the IVs were
kept secret and an error-propagating mode, such as PCBC, were used.  The
extra, secret IVs would seemingly add to the total "keyspace" if used that
way.

Actually, the S-boxes in DES are each arranged as 4 'sub' S-boxes that
  take 4 input bits and produce 4 output bits in a reversible way. See:

     Lecture notes in Computer Science: 149 Cryptography
     "Are big S-boxes best: J.A. Gordon and H. Retkin".

  the non-linearity in the DES S-boxes comes from careful arrangement of
  these sub-S-boxes.  The above mentioned article shows that the probability
  of linearity in an S-box arrangement consisting of many reversible
  'sub' S-boxes decreases factorially with input size.

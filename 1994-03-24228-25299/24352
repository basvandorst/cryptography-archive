Please don't think that I'm posting without having read the newsgroup, because
the exact opposite is true.  I was wondering if somebody could recommend a good
book on number theory.  I've looked at several crypto books, but I'm trying to
find a book that specializes ONLY on number theory (that IS what I'm looking
for, right?) and that starts off fairly slowly.  I've had three semesters of
Calculus but that was a while ago, and hasn't helped me much in the number
theory books that I've looked at.  Maybe then I'll have a better idea of what
you people are talking about.

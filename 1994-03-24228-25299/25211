  From "The Monitor" March 24th Edition via Compuserve
  (March 24)
     The U.S. Postal Service today told Congress that it is looking
  at ways to become the electronic road map to government
  information. 
     Associated Press writer Randolph E. Schmid reports from Washington,
  D.C., that Postmaster General Marvin Runyon told a Senate
  Governmental Affairs subcommittee today that he sees the Postal
  Service as a potential government on-ramp to the information
  superhighway being envisioned by the Clinton administration. 
  "We are working with other organizations to develop an interactive
  information kiosk and provide a platform that can be used by other
  federal agencies to serve their customers," Runyon said, adding
  that the post office is the nation's original information highway,
  delivering to more than 123 million mailboxes across the country. 
  He predicted that as computer connections become more common,
  there will be an increased need for interconnections among
  businesses and homes. "Working with other federal agenies, we may
  be able to develop an electronic commerce system," Runyon said. 
  The postmaster general also suggested, "perhaps our lobbies could
  serve as `on-ramps' providing access to anyone who wants to be on
  the electronic superhighway."
     Runyon raised the possibility of finding a way for the post office
  to certify electronic messages to safeguard their privacy,
  "securing one company's market-sensitive information from the
  intruding eyes of its competitors."
     AP notes that the Commerce and Justice departments are currently
  setting up a system to safeguard electronic communications, but
  which also allows law enforcement to wiretap if necessary.

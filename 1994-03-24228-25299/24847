After reading the exchange between Mr Colin James III and the other participants
of this newsgroup, I have come to the conclusion that Mr James iis in need of some
serious vacation time. To attack other with LEGAL threats when no commerical
infringment was made, since that is the reason Patents are issued anyway!, is a
disgusting display of bullying. But to notify employers of participants is in no
way excusable behavior and I would like to make a call to all readers to request
a public apology from Mr James. Thankyou a concerned reader.

Has anyone heard anything about GEnie or any of the other commercial
services "blocking" PGP messages?  A friend over on GEnie sent me a message
over the Internet and encrypted it using PGP.  It never arrived, although
unencrypted messages sent before and after it arrived just fine.  This was
repeated a day later with similar results.

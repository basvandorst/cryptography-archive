I am a US citizen, living in Canada.

If I write a piece of encryption software here in Canada, am I in vio-
lation of US export laws if I export it outside of Canada or the US
without getting an export license from US officials first?  (Assume,
for the sake of this discussion, that the exportation in question would
definitely be legal under Canadian law, if a Canadian were to write the
same software in Canada.)

Stated another way, does the US claim the right to regulate what I (a
US citizen) do with crypto software which I write somewhere else -- so
that, in effect, I have to make sure whatever I did with said software
meets the legal requirements both of the US and of whatever country I
am producing the stuff in and exporting it from?

Does it make any difference if I work on the encryption software in
question as part of my job, and my employer wishes to distribute it
outside of Canada or the US -- as opposed to my distributing something
I have done on my own?  Would my employer (a wholly Canadian-owned com-
pany whose offices are located only in Canada) be risking a violation
of US export law if I (a US citizen) were to start working on encryp-
tion software for them?

Please note that I'm not trying to start up yet another discussion
about whether US export laws are silly or not.  I simply want to know
what (if anything) those laws have to say about the above situations.

   I was wondering if anyone might have any information on the maximum possible
throughput for various software only encryption schemes (DES,RSA in particular).
I know this is totally dependent on the algorithm used, so I guess in a way I'm
looking for the most efficient implementation of these encryption techniques. 
Also, now that I think of it any throughput values would be dependent on the 
processor on which it was running, so this information would be useful as well. 
Pointers to locations or an FAQ that might have this kind of information are 
appreciated. Thanks.

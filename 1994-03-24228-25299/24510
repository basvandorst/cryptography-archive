I hereby retract that the posted rng is unpatentable, because it may 
be covered by patent 5_251_165 or some other previous patent.  I 
restrict my claim that anyone can use it to simply, *I* don't mind if 
anyone uses it.  Finally, I was responsible for developing and posting 
the rng, Oracle was not involved (except that that is where my mail 
account is).

I do not know the rng used in patent 5_251_165, and I don't know what 
claims the posted rng violates, so I can't be any more specific than 
this.  I continue to claim that what I posted is a good prng.

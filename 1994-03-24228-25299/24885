Oh, fer chrissake; you're typing it blind anyway.  Separate the lines with / or tab or something.

Actually, you can, although PGP does not currently correctly convert
passphrases to ISO Latin-1 before hashing them, so you'll sacrifice
portability.  (Although how you enter an accented character on a VT100
is a bit beyond me, so you're sacrificing portability, anyway.)

Probably more important is translating Userids properly.

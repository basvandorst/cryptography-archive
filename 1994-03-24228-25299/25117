I have what may be a real "novice" question. When PGP is finally
"cracked/broken" will it then be a relatively simple matter to decode data
encrypted with it ? Or will it be neccessary to mount the same massive initial
effort for each attempt at decrypting a message ? I hope someone can help me
with this as i am a real newcomer to this forum.
Thanks,

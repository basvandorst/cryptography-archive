   Let's keep in mind the difference between key length and security.
FEAL-4X has a 128-bit key, but you don't have to postulate year 2200
technology to break it.
 
   Anyone can design a cipher with a long key.  The question, still un-
answered, is "does IDEA's security merit a 128-bit key?"  The same
questions can be asked of Skipjack's 80-bit key, since nobody will
*really* know if Skipjack is any stronger than DES, or even as strong
as DES, unless there's public review of the algorithm.  (A similar
argument can be applied to 160-bit or 256-bit hash functions--are
collisions *really* going to require on the order of 2**80 or 2**128
operations to find?)

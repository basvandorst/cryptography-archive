My recollection of the original post was that a claim was made
regarding a given algorithm that - 'this is public domain, use
it freely wherever and however you please', or words to that effect.

I beleive it was this claim to which Mr. James was responding,
which, in consideration of Mr. James belief that the algorithm
impinges upon his patent in some way, was necessary in order to
defend his alleged rights under the patent.

This was in no way shape or form a threat to the open discussion of
cryptology. We can talk about it all we want, but we must still
remain responsible for our words, and when someone claims to have
originated some idea, or to own given algorithm, or even that the
algorithm is 'public domain', be prepared that someone else
may disagree, and assert their own rights in the matter.
Whether the patent will turn out to be valid, and whether the
given post's claims did in fact threaten the given patent, and
whether software should even be patentable are of course still
legitimate questions and concerns, so please, carry on ...

This claim by the academic is in error. Private mail is copyright by the
sender. One doesn't lose his copyright by sending it to someone who has
posted a public notice that he won't respect copyrights.

In the magazine case, letters are sent to the letters to the editor address,
which is specifically construed as an offer for publication. In that case,
the "letters become the property of the magazine" claim is perhaps
sustainable.

But when one sends email to another address than that of a "letters to the
editor", one is not offering such email for publication.

To see this, consider that magazines do not suggest that letters sent to the
business office of that magazine become their property, nor could they
publish them without permission.

 I should first say that I'm almost totally ignorant of TEMPEST. Can't
 TEMPEST techniques read the data as it is typed, echo or not? Granted,
 it would probably be easier if it was echo'ed.

 With regard to the actual program, (and I'm NOT sure if this
 can be done. I don't program much, and certaintly not in this field)
 can the driver store a list of encrypted files in expanded memory,
 and then have *just* those files encrypyed?

 What I mean is that when a file is first accessed, the driver checks
 a list in expanded memory, and, if the file is listed as "encrypted,"
 goes active and decrypts it. I can already see one *big* problem
 with this, if it uses IDEA (or any other random cypher): If Joe Blow
 uses multiple passphrases, there's no way, short of a checksum/et cetera
 to make sure that the program won't read pure garbage.

 Does SFS have an option to encrypt floppies? And what algorithm(s) does
 it use? Just curious.

The limits to growth on the stakeholders are different. For the user, the
limit is some acceptable number of seconds to do the encryption. For the
cracker, the limit is the budget he has for parallel proccessor machines.

Perhaps at some state of the art for personal computers, we will reach a
point where key lengths are everyday-practical (in the above sense), while
cracking budgets aren't within the means of rich, smart cryptologic
organizations working on targeted messages with special-purpose very fast
parallel processor machines. If the race is between an exponential growth of
cracker machine budgets vs. a linear or polynomial growth of encryption
machine limiting times, there's some state of the art/state of readily
available PCs that will tilt the advantage sharply to the encryptor,
assuming brute force search by the cracker.

I don't know what that is, and there have been discussions of the matter on
sci.crypt. So far nobody has posted the table I suggested, parameterizing
the above calculation.

I do have, however, one piece of collateral unclassified information. About
25 years ago, when the Air Force was funding computer capability increases
through their "Technical Objectives Document" program, they were pursuing
approaches of the kind we've seen come to fruition today, but also
approaches we've heard very little about in public such as microwave
computers, cryogenic computers, "light wave" computers. It's at least
possible that the classified state of the art for "cracking" computers is
massively more powerful than those of us on the "outside" suspect.

In contrast, one recent post seems to suggest that we've gone well past that
break point now with IDEA, but the calculations were incomplete and there's
not been time for a response from the experts on sci.crypt. Stay tuned,
especially to sci.crypt.

Note that I don't make my own calculations on this one, relying on the
calculations of others, particularly those who are anti-Clipper, to reduce
the potential for noisy complaints. 

(It's not working, though. Instead, I'm getting noisy complaints about why I
don't do my own calculations.) :-)

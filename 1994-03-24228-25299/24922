As we learn more, the FBI's proposal seems initially to be a way to nullify
call forwarding avoidance of wiretaps. They've been kinda opaque about it
until recently, perhaps because they fear they'll be planting ideas in some
heads that wouldn't otherwise have thought of it. That creates a fear of the
unknown due to the over-general authority they seemed to be trying to get,
and there's no doubt if they got over-general authority, at some point
they'd use it.

That doesn't change the cost, economic, and policy issues they must address,
since the phone companies seem to have understood this perfectly well in
preparing their testimony.

By the way, I am not an FBI basher--quite the opposite. But on this one I
think they are WAY off base.

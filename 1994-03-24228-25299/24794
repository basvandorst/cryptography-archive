No.  This statement is nonsense.

A patent consists of one or more claims.  An infringement is judged against
individual claims, standing on their own.  In fact, even if all the claims
but one in a patent are knocked out as begin invalid for some reason or
another, the remaining one may still remain valid.

Individual claims may be stated as conjunctions - "A device for sitting
consisting of a flat surface and three legs arranged in an equilateral
triangle" would describe a particular kind of stool, and a three-legged
table, a four-legged chair, or even a three-legged stool with the legs *not*
in an equilateral triangle would not infringe on this particular claim - but
that's another issue.

Patents usually consist of a number of claims which overlap to varying
degrees.  Some are very narrow; others very broad.  The patent containing the
above claim about a three-legged stool would probably contain another claim
for "A flat surface suitable for supporting objects of significant weight,
supported by a plurality of [patent-tese for two or more] legs." The theory
is that the broadest claims may be knocked out, and the holder of the patent
will want something to fall back on - something that is as broad as possible.
Failing that, the separate narrow claims, which may be the only ones to
survive, may still cover enough ground to protect the patent holder.

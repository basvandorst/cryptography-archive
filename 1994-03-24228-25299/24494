I don't know of any formal certification program.
But checking your implementation against just a few test
cases would practically guarantee that your implementation
was correct.  (If only the author of that Dr. Dobb's article 
on DES a few years ago had bothered to check his DES implementation
against even one case, he probably wouldn't have published a bogus
implementation.)

I'm somewhat confused. The PGP documentation mentions that
RSA is patented in the US, does this mean that anyone using
PGP without permission is breaking the patent, if yes, there
are a lot of people doing so. Also, if the patent only applies
in the US is it okay to download from a foreign site and use
outside the US?

Thanks in advance for your response.

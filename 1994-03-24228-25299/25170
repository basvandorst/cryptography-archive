Thomas Cain, a phd student here and Dr. Alan Sherman, wrote "How
to Break Gifford's Cipher".  I'm not sure how it will be
published.

Gifford's cipher was designed by David K. Gifford of MIT around
1982-1984 as part of a news-distribution system prototype, the
"Boston Community Information System".  I don't think it is
currently in use.

Gifford's cipher generates a pseudo random bit stream using a
non-linear combining function on several linear feedback shift
register sequences.  Cain and Sherman use an extension of
Siegenthaler's attack to separate the sequences, using ciphertext
only.  ( See Siegenthaler, T.  "Decrypting a class of stream
ciphers using ciphertext only", IEEE Transactions on Computers,
C-34:1 (Jan 85) pages 81-85.)

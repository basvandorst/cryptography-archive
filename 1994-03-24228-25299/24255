     i recently read a usenet article which said something to the
effect that Phil Zimmerman (the fellow who gave us e-mail privacy
via the PGP freeware) is now developing a program called STU-4.

     as i understand it, STU-4 will allow us to encrypt our phone
conversations so that even those who tap our phones won't be able 
to make sense of the resulting garble.  am i correct about this?

     if so, what kind of computer hardware will one need to use
STU-4?  is it being written for PCs or for UNIX machines?

     finally, when can we expect that STU-4 will be available?  if
it were out prior to the availability of Clipper phones, perhaps the
Clipper chip would be dead before it got off the ground.

I thought the "MD" series was a modification detection protocol.  It
may happen to use public key today, but I never knew it was a requirement.
DES is today used for forms of modification detection.

The real point is that there are lots of uses for a Skipjack algorithm
that use DES just fine today, but are not classic point to point cryptography.
You can't dismiss these applications on grounds they all use public key
today, because some do use DES and for many RSA (and its accompanying
performance vis a vis DES or presumably Skipjack) is overkill.

This means that Skipjack is further crippled and it also means there'll
be legitimate need to develop something else for the many pseudo-crypto
applications out there that will just so happen to turn out to be a 
legitimate crypto algorithm.

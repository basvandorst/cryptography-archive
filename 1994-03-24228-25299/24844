   Phil Karn's three-round MD5-based encryption scheme required three
   rounds of MD5 to process half a block of input data.  The above method
   requires only one round of hash function to process a full block of
   input data.  Thus, this method should be six times faster than Phil's.

One problem with using MD5 is that it produces 128 bits of hash output
for larger blocks of input, though you could take 128 bits
of input and pad to the 448 bits or whatever it is in a 512-bit block.
It's been a while since I've seen Phil's reasons for the details in
his system, but there were some weaknesses that they addressed.

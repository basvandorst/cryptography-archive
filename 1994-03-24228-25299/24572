Some versions of PKZip 1.0 & 1.1 were distributed outside of the US
without encryption.  During the life of 1.1 PKWare gained blanket export
permission, though many ftp sites & European shareware dealers continued
to supply only the 'export' edition.  Compiled copies of Info-Zip's
compatible programs are often put up for ftp without the encryption
facility included.

All zip compatible programs that include encryption use the same method,
(you still need to match version numbers though).

PKzip 1.0 & 1.1 have fault in their randomisation code, which makes
cracking encrypted archives fairly easy.  Info-Zip's compatible tools
and PKzip >= 1.93alpha are much more secure - I don't yet have a general
method to open all archives.  (I can open some, if specific conditions
are met, or additional information provided).  I'll post more details in
a couple of weeks, when I've done some more experiments and drafted a
paper on it.

Basically: zip encryption will keep my mum & kid brother out, but it
is vulnerable to any serious cryptanalyst.

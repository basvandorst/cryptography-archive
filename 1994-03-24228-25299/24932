--     Leaking of the von Newmann report caused an uproar at the Moore
-- School.  The ENIAC project was of course classified, and Johnny von
-- was brought in as an outside expert to evaluate progress.  He took
-- what he learned and turned it into a proposal for a new machine,
-- the EDVAC.  He attempted to avoid security by not mentioning the
-- ENIAC (the war was over in Europe, but not in Japan), but instead
-- made many lifetime enemies.

--     The only part of the von Newmann report that anyone at the
-- Moore school thought was innovative was the concept of mixing
-- program and data storage.  The team, of course, thought that this
-- was "instantly obvious" from the ENIAC design, since the switch
-- panels (for constants) and the plugboards (for programs) had the
-- same interface.  They went downstairs to check this out, and found
-- that the machine was--at that time--connected precisely that way
-- for testing while the plugboards were being worked on.

--     (I sort of need double comments here.  The above is what I was
-- TOLD.)  I did find occasional programs from 1946 which loaded
-- constant data into registers, then executed it as an instruction,
-- but none from 1945.  I think this "feature" was used in the Euler
-- lemma proof from early July 1946...  At the time the von Neumann
-- report reached the Moore school, as far as I know, construction and
-- debugging was still underway.  But someone could have rigged it
-- that way for testing.  As I remember it both the patch boards and
-- switch panels were not wall mounted but free standing and could be
-- wheeled to where they were used.  My father may still have some
-- program "listings," but he moved from the Philadelphia area to
-- Maryland a few years ago, and a LOT of stuff got thrown out.  I
-- still have a couple of cases of stuff, but I don't think I have an
-- ENIAC documentation.

--     Again it depends on definitions, and I will gladly concede that
-- the Manchester Mark I was the first stored program computer
-- designed as such.  The original ENIAC features which allowed it to
-- be used that way were a side-effect of shared design.  (It was
-- easier to design instructions, constants and data to use a single
-- format for transmission than to design the same functionality three
-- times, although there originally was some discussion of making
-- constants and data different widths!) 

--     But I still claim that the ENIAC was the first computer to use
-- stored programs, and in what is now a footnote, it was certainly
-- the first computer to use self modifying code.  I'd have to look
-- back, but as I remember it, addresses were two digits.  Although
-- there were always plans for two or three patch boards, the original
-- tests were with one, and the addresses for instructions, registers
-- and data were not segregated.  To get more than 20? instructions in
-- a routine you had to use the constant registers or the data
-- registers.  Later the machine was converted to freeze a single set
-- of instructions in the patch panels and to use extended constant
-- registers for programming.  But that has always been described to
-- me as an optimization--the time to rewire the patch panels was much
-- greater than the time to reset the constant boards, so the
-- time-savings from that change was worth the loss in flexibility.

--      But these changes neither added or removed the ability to
-- execute an instruction from the data registers.  As near as anyone
-- I ever talked to knows, that was a "minor" revision added during
-- development to quickly cycle through testing all possible
-- instructions--or more to the point testing all data registers with
-- a single operation like multiplication.  (A big problem during
-- construction was, of course, miswiring.  Since data was decimal,
-- using ring counters, it was easy to cross wires and turn say a 5
-- into a 9.)

--    What means familiar?  John Mauchly told me he had looked at it and

-- Two comments.  1) The placement of this reference is "unfortunate"
-- since it is tied to completion not inception.  2) Any real history
-- in this area needs to include the Bush Differential Analyzer at MIT
-- and the similar Differential Analyzer at the Moore School.
-- (According to my father, the difference was that the Moore School
-- Analyzer worked. ;-) The I in ENIAC was an attempt to sell the
-- ENIAC as a successor, even though it worked on entirely different

-- much later--is January 31, 1946.  That was the day of the

--     Not quite true...  The patents, plural were granted in 1964, the
-- one concerning an electronic digital computer is overturned in
-- 1973.  The others mostly cover vacuum tube logic designs which were
-- almost obsolete by the time they were granted.

-- See above.  The registers and switches were treated interchangably.
-- The normal use was to put program and constants in the switches,
-- but you could execute an instruction in any of the 20 registers.

--   Just a few corrections.  The memory is/was actually 36-bits,
-- treated as either six six-bit characters, 9 XS3 decimal digits, or
-- two instructions. (XS3 comes from adding three to the binary
-- representation to get the arithmetic carries and borrows right.)

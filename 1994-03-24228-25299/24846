To clarify the historical record, at the time I wrote a reply to this
discussion earlier today, I had not yet read Colin James's message
referenced above. My knowledge of Marsaglia's work dates from
the mid 1960's when I was a graduate student at the University of
Illinois and my reference to "Marsaglia Mixing" was from memory.

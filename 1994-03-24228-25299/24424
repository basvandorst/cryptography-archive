No.  Clipper doesn't know or care how the keys get negotiated - not
its problem.  *You* have to care, though less with Clipper (since the
algorithm is classified) than with a normal system such as DES or IDEA,
since anybody who steals your keys can read your stuff.  Clipper works
by sending the session key (encrypted with the goverment master key
and also with your chip's builtin key) at the beginning of the message,
so the government can use the master key to get your chip's serial number 
and then get the builtin key for your chip from the keymasters.
They don't need to know how the key was exchanged to steal it.
You can send guys with the keys in briefcases handcuffed to their arms
for all the FBI cares - the chip is giving them the key.

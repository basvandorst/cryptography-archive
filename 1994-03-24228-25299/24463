To accompany an article in this week's TIME, the magazine commissioned a
poll on public attitudes toward Clipper. The relevant graph: 

  "In a Time/CNN poll of 1,000 Americans conducted last week by Yankelovich
Partners, two-thirds said it was more important to protect the privacy of
phone calls than to preserve the ability of police to conduct wiretaps.
When informed about the Clipper Chip, 80% said they opposed it."

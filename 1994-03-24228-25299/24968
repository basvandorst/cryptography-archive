Another simpler approach is to just have the poster generate two
large random primes and save them locally in a secure place.
They are multiplied and their product goes into the message header.

The cancel software should require the factors of this large number
(the product of the primes) in a valid cancellation messages;
cancel messages without the factors are rejected as forged.

An unauthorized canceller has to factor the number, which is
computationally infeasable for sufficiently large numbers.
The original poster just needs to supply the saved numbers.

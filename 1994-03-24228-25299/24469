We changed the key-scheduling scheme to use alternating 12 and 13-bit
rotations, rather than fixed 12-bit.

The initial and final XOR of the key with the plaintext/ciphertext
was dropped.

The S-boxes were changed to flatten out their XOR profile (thus
improving resistance to differential cryptanalysis), and to
eliminate any value of X such that f(X)=0, where f is the combination
of the E, S, and P boxes.

And we changed the name to LOKI-91.

All this occurred in mid-1991, and to my knowledge, LOKI hasn't
changed since.

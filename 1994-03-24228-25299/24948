I'm not Bruce, or even a cryptographer.  But until the fascis^H^H^H^H^H^H
US government outlaws it, I play one in the privacy of my home.

The details of Blowfish were published in the April 1994 issue of Dr. Dobbs
along with a contest to determine weaknesses in the algorithm.  If Bruce
knows any weaknesses, he certainly didn't state them in the article.

The advantage of the algorithm is that it is (appears to be) blazingly
fast.

I have been rather suprised thus far to see no discussion of the
contest on this newsgroup, but then serious discussion of the scientific
and mathematical aspects of cryptography seem to be against its charter.

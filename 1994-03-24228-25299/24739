Richard L Robertson posted on 3/15/94 a lengthy message on 
sci.crypt which attacks me personally as a "paranoid" and
makes many mistaken assertions about my patent and license
agreement, among other negative things.  

I would like to remind the readers of sci.crypt that Mr
Robertson is neither a physician nor a lawyer nor a priest.

I stopped responding to prodigious private email from Mr
Robertson when I realized he was not serious about his
inquiries, but rather a genuine hobbyist;  this happened 
when he expressed a profound interest in APIs written in C 
or C++ to implement my patent.

Mr Robertson has demanded that I make an apology to
sci.crypt.

I regret wasting my time, or anyone's time on sci.crypt, by 
having responded to him or his cronies.

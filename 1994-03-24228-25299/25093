Who is Schneier? I have never heard of him.

In any event, he has his facts wrong. The first implementation of the
Quadratic Sieve was done by Joe Gerver on an HP-3000 back in 1982.
He took about 70 hours to do a 47-digit number.

Davis and Holdridge did not do their QS implementation until May of
1983. The first number they factored was a 51-digit cofactor of 7^67+1.
They improved their code until they factored a 71-digit number in
March 1984. That 71 digit number took 9.5 hours on a Cray-XMP.
Doing an 82-digit number would be about 10 times as hard. The
statement "in 1980, factoring 82 DIGIT hard numbers took a few hours..."
is therefore in error. Not only that, the XMP was not available in 1980.

Please note, that Davis & Holdridge were using a variation of the
basic QS algorithm known as "special-q". As I showed in 1985,
Peter Montgomery's  multiple polynomial version was (and is) more
efficient.

:>machine can factor 100 digit numbers in two weeks.; $10 million to factor
 
The $25K figure is for parts only. It does not include the time/salary
of those who design the machine. For custom-purpose hardware this cost
should be included.

:>150 digits in a year (all based on unclassified technology).
 
This is approximately correct today.

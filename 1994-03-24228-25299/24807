Good!  This is a big help for me in analyzing this patent.  I kind of
thought so, but it's good to see it said.  If his patent is taken 
literally, none of the algorithms that brought on James' complaints
infringe his patent that I can see.  He has patented a particular 
table lookup used for rng with cryptographic application not excluded.
His public statements, however, sound like he is claiming any and all
table lookups used for rngs/crypto.

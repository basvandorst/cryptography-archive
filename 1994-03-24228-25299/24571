>What's the difference between a field and a ring?

Commutative ring:

                Closed under addition subtraction, multiplication.

                Includes 1 and 0 (some authors do not require it to have 1).

                Obeys familiar laws such as a*(b - c) = b*a - a*c*1 - 0*d.

Integral domain:

                A commutative ring in which
                a*b = 0 implies a = 0 or b = 0.

Field:

                A commutative ring in which every nonzero element
                has a multiplicative inverse: Given a with a <> 0,
                there exists a' such that a * a' = a' * a = 1.

                In other words, division by nonzero elements is possible.

        The rationals Q, the real numbers R, and the complex numbers C
are fields.

        The integers Z are an integral domain but not a field
(for example, 1/4 is not an integer).

        Another example of an integral domain which is not a field
is the polynomials (in one variable) with real coefficients.

        If N > 1, the integers modulo N form a commutative ring.
This ring is both an integral domain and a field if N is prime,
but neither if N is composite.

        The 2 x 2 matrices with real entries do not form a commutative ring
because there are 2 x 2 matrices A, B such that A * B <> B * A.
(However, all of the other axioms such as associativity of addition and
multiplication hold, and this is sometimes called a noncommutative ring).

        The even integers are not a commutative ring since there
is no multiplicative identity: there is no even integer e such 
that e * x = x for all even integers x.  But the other requirements hold.

        EXERCISE:  Any finite integral domain is a field.

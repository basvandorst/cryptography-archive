If you JUST use a key as input to the hash function, and generate a
one-time-pad, then you have to make sure you never re-use the key.
This is for the same reason that you can only use a one-time-pad once.

If you seed the hash function "one-time-pad" with a unique initial
block, as in the encryption method I proposed, this is no longer a
problem.  On the whole, I think the method you propose would then be
roughly as strong as the method that I proposed.

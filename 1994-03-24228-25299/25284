Michael Johnson has lent me space on his export controlled ftp site for a 
limited time for my cryptogram solving program.  It cannot be exported.
Ftp to csn.org /mpj/I_will_not_export/crypto_????????/cryptanalysis
and get crypt200.exe.  This is a self-extracting file for downloading
to your pc.  There should also be a crypt200.txt file telling you what
to do with it, but it isn't really necessary once you execute crypt200.exe.

See Mike's README.MPJ for the conditions to be observed and to learn ???????.

More permanently, my crypt solver program is on Mike's Colorado Catacombs
BBS, 303-938-9654.  This is also an export controlled site.

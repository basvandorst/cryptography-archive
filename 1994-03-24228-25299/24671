The USG has a precedent of attempting to enforce export restrictions in
an extra-territorial manner.  There was a heavily publicised case in the
mid-80s.  A British company was buying second hand VAXs and exporting
them to Eastern Europe, (ie equipment that was being placed by upgrades
to new/faster models).  At the same time the USG routinely issued export
licences to DEC for bigger/faster models to those countries.  The CIA
kidnapped the British manager of the company for trial in the US.  There
was a big fuss that the British Government 'allowed' this kidnapping.

Unfortunately I haven't kept news clipping of this.  Hopefully someone else
here will be reminded by my account, and fill in some details?

First, your imputations of motives to me are quite wrong and spoil the rest
of your message. Let's pass over that.

I notice you didn't post this to sci.crypt, so I've taken the liberty of
adding that group to the list, since that's where the expertise is.

Your math seemed quite clear except when you popped up with:

How many keys to we have to check?

3.4028237E38

That obviously refers to something not contained in your message.
Since you've gone to such pains to reduce everything to self-contained
step-by-step demonstration, perhaps you'd be kind enough to fill in the
missing material there. You're making a pretty good case so far that the 80
year calculation for a single processor workstation is "off".

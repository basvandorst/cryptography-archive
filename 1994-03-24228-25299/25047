Is this a profound weakness or am I somewhat mistaken?

The algorithm may be terrific, and astoundingly secure.  But consider this:
If you have your public key, and MAIL to yourself, how hard would it be to
bruteforce crack your private key?  Let's say 18 months with help through
distributed INTERNET processing (maybe more).

Now that you have your keys (priv and public), and you have the public key of
anyone else, it'd be rather easy to calculate everyone's public key wouldn't
it?

The cracking of RSA-129 shows that one-way functions are of dubious utility.

   If it's commonly used, then it will begin to pay to build special purpose
machines to crack it.
 
   I disagree with the argument that interleaved rounds of the different
encryption functions is a good idea--the permutations and s-boxes and
expansion in DES are all optimized for each other, and they appear to be
very fragile!  Remember what happened in differential attacks when you
made some apparently trivial change in one s-box entry, or swap two bits
of permutation.
 
   The reason I'm interested in multiple encryption with DES and IDEA is
that, while both appear to be quite strong, only one needs to be strong,
barring some weird interaction between the two, for my data to be secure.
(Of course, 2**56 is still too small a keyspace....)
 
   I think designing a new cryptosystem, with interleaved DES and IDEA
rounds, would require as much new analysis as any other new encryption
algorithm.  (Of course, you'd probably want to interleave PAIRS of DES
rounds with IDEA rounds, if you were going to do anything of that sort.)

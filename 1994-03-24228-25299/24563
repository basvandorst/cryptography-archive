I'm ignorant of cryptography, but a very pragmatic technique
would be to encrypt twice using different cryptosystems, say DES first
then RSA. That way if DES is cracked, you've still got RSA to keep
your secrets. Then you can change to another (currently) safe
cryptosystem.

Of course, you would have to be -extremely- paranoid 
(or have -big- secrets), and the technique won't work in the
(assumedly) unlikely event that both cryptosystems are
cracked at the same time.

So let's do it.  We'll need a charter, which will be a significant
amount of work.  Basically, all that it needs to say is that questions
and comments should be of a predominantly technical nature, shouldn't
ask any questions already in the FAQ, and shouldn't be flames (or
flamebait.)  I don't think that the moderator need be a godlike crypto
expert- the charter should make it obvious what kind of postings will
be permitted.  Does anyone in sci.crypt have any experience of the
process of creating such a newsgroup?

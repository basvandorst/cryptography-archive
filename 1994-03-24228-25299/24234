Possibly it help keep the number called secret.

It is a little more secure than a simple phone by wire.

The GSM encryption is only used between the phone and the
phone station.
I read an article about the GSM system in Germany (Swedish
supplier): The software at the phone station were missing
software to tap individual calls, but the police didn't
mind this much. Maybe they could tap all calls?

American crypto is only a threat if you use it :-)
I'd be wary of using pgp for anything else than casual secrets
like illicit affairs and simple business correspondence.
It is mostly a toy. It should help against casual attempts
to crack it though.

Ok. As Steve Tate suggested, let us call a pseudo-field a ring such that it
is hard to produce non-invertible value.

I meant "if non trivial factor of n is hard to produce", what is the common
use of the term *factorization* in cryptography. So let us call pseudo-prime
a integer such that it is hard to produce non-trivial factor. Z/nZ is a
pseudo-field iff n is a pseudo-prime.

Absolutly : the status of a ring may change with time. We can not use classical
logic in cryptography as some functions which might appear to be secure can
be broken in further study. The situation is similar in quantum theory : a
system have no particular status until we ought it to get one by some measure.
Hence, a ring is presumably a pseudo-field until we find some non-invertible
value.

In fact, I do not know it but I seem to. Please do not tell it to my pupils :-)

The Chinese Remainder theorem have no effective proof when n is too large.
Let n=1707993630254681704667787622840355296721647817383078871003082688745741.
Rabin and Miller say n is not a prime, but I challenge you to get a non-trivial
factor. Hence, no Chinese people is able to exhibit Z/pZ or Z/qZ, neither to
give the image of a randomly chosen integer by the isomorphism. Hence, Z/nZ is
a pseudo-field until someone can break n.

From an other point of view, I am sure (Diffie and Hellman | Rivest, Shamir and
Adleman | Fiat and Shamir) would be interested to hear you feel embarrased
because there exists some non-invertible values in their ring!

I agree my statements was a little provocative. However, I believe all this
is the way we have to look fields in crypto. Moreover, this is the real point
of view of most cryptanalysis. I did not check everything, but I believe all
factorization algorithms use rings (like Z/nZ) as they where fields until they
get a factor.

The damage come from the fact we are able to prove a ring is not a field (let
us remind the Rabin-Miller test for instance) with non effective proofs.
Everything might be effective!

One of the recent publications of the National Computer Security
Center is rather interesting: A Guide to Understanding Covert
Channel Analysis of Trusted Systems (NCSC-TG-030). 122 pages.

A really good primer on covert channel identification and handling,
a description of formal and practical tools for covert channel analysis,
including aggregated channels.

This material is useful not only for System designers and tiger teams
but for persons designing secure applications (like PGP).

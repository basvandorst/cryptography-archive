   I've read several articles suggesting that people have different keys
for different purposes.  A 512-bit key is probably fine, if all I'm using
it for is e-mail to my girlfriend.  1024 bit keys are much too short if
I'm using it to hold the unlock codes for fusion bombs.
 
   Does anyone know when/if PGP and/or RIPEM are coming out with options
for longer keys?

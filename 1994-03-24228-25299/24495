If this is true, then IMHO it is in RSA Data Labs' own best interests
to make this fact as widely known as possible. If PGP attains widespread
use in academic sites' in the US, then commercial sites will likely
follow with site-licenses of ViaCrypt PGP. On the other hand, if academic
sites do not use PGP very much for fear of patent infringements,
corporations will be much less likely to buy ViaCrypt site-licenses because
ViaCrypt PGP will be worth less to them since fewer people are actually
using it, and it is too complicated and risky for a commercial site
to distinguish between commericial and non-commercial use on a routine
basis. Academic sites, of course, in general would be unwilling to purchase
something like ViaCrypt PGP, so free PGP is really the only option for
them.

Perhaps RSA Data Lab's should draw up a license or some other document
which states that PGP or a certain version of PGP that issues X disclaimer
upon startup are OK for non-commercial use only, and this license
could be bundled with future versions of PGP.

Are there any reasons RSA Data Labs should not do this?

Greetings:

I am working on another book, on electronic-mail security.  The
book will discuss and compare PGP and PEM (without being a
polemic).  Plans are to have the book published before Christmas,
but who knows.

This is a call for information and readers.

Information first.  I have the PGP-FAQ, the RIPEM FAQ and the
RIPEM Attacks, the MAC PGP document, and the PGP, TIS-PEM, and
RIPEM documentation.  Is there anything I am missing?

I'm also interested in comments from users of both PGP and PEM. 
What do you like?  What don't you like?  That sort of thing.

And finally, I am looking for people who are interested in
reading a draft manuscript in mid-April.

Anyone?

Bruce

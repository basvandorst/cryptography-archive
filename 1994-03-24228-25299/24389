Hello,

Hope this is the right place to ask, and apologies if it has been asked
a million times before. :-) but I did glance at the FAQ.

I have a piece of uniplex email that I want to retrieve - unfortunately
I was sent it with a password; I can't remember the password
and the sender has left. I have a paper copy but it would really be
useful if I could forward it to another user without re-typing. If it
can't be done then tough to me I guess. Any ideas folks or should I
forget it.

Again apologies if it's old hat, or if this is the wrong place to ask.
Email me if appropriate and I will summarize. Ta.

.....shin

Why are message digest algorithms separate from encryption algorithms? 
Surely if you started with a block of 128 zeros and encrypted it using
IDEA in some complex feedback mode using every 128 characters of message
as a different key, then learning anything about the message, or finding
another with the same effect, would be akin to a known plaintext attack
on multiple invocations of the cypher?

On a related note, the FAQ lists a number of different feedback modes
but says nothing about their relative advantages and disadvantages
except to say that ECB obviously offers a number of security holes and
that errors in transmission of CBC encoded messages can be recovered
from in two blocks, a property some consider undesirable.  I tried
playing around with the different possibilities for a reasonably simple
feedback mode and came up with one I can't find mentioned anywhere:

Q[i+1] = P[i+1] XOR R[i]
R[i+1] = E_k(Q[i+1])
C[i+1] = R[i+1] XOR Q[i]

and decryption is symmetrical, with D_k replacing E_k:

R[i+1] = C[i+1] XOR Q[i]
Q[i+1] = D_k(R[i+1])
P[i+1] = Q[i+1] XOR R[i]

Using this scheme, what is encrypted with E_k is dependant on the
entire message stream.  It cannot (as far as I can see) be deduced even
with full knowledge of both the plain and cyphertext.  Any change to
the message stream results in destruction of the tail of the message. 
And it's only one block encryption per block of text (unlike
overlapping CFB and OFB schemes).

Does this have well-known (or well-suspected) weaknesses, or
disadvantages over other feedback modes?  If so, where are they
discussed?

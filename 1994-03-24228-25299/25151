I could have sworn the longest one offered on the menu was 1,024 bits, but
I'll have to recheck that.  Are you talking version 2.3a, or something
later?

I read *somewhere* that the US DoD "uses RSA to protect nuclear weapons".
I'm not sure where I read it, though.  Maybe in the PGP docs?

I somehow doubt that they'd publicly claim or admit that, even if they
could.

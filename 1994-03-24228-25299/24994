  I am a cryppie history buff. Can you help me? Somewhat like the
Japanese news broadcast that inserted the "WINDS MESSAGES", I would
like to find explicit references as to how BBC-London prefaced the
open code broadcasts to agents in Europe.  That is, what preceded
the "SNOBALL, Mother has taken a liking to you.", "CELERY, the harvest
moon is rising over the meadow." and the like.  I don't find such in
Kahn, Clayton, Masterman or Farago.  Any leads, cryppies?

Actually, they do have far greater capacities, it is just not cost
effective to utilize it (nor is the performance high enough). Do you
really want to have to read a block 10^4 times and perform a statistical
analysis of the reads to load a program - no! But would some one be
willing to do this to get the key to a whole disk - possibly. If I
just need one sectors - and money is no object I can use low energy
electron scattering, ferrofluid with optical tracers or ... to read
out the data on a much finer scale than a typical disk head.

How's this for an idea in today's economically fierce and competitive world?

I could open up a Tempest-Rent-a-Van, and people who wanted to use 
tempest on thier competitors could rent a van full of tempest equipemnt 
and a insturctor. I have a better idea now, people could HIRE me to do 
Tempest raids myself, and id make a good deal of profit. Plus i could 
probably sell the information to another person, like a double spy.
That would be cool.

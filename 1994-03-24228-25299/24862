This is most definitely a topic for sci.crypt.

Nonetheless, you can find a  lot of stuff on encryption at ftp.informatik.
uni-hamburg.de.  Check like /pub/security/crypt or something like that.

DES does not at all have to be used.  And, furthermore, your description
is quite a bit like the current system.  Currently, a password is
encrypted through a method using an s-box (like a function).  A salt
is created through the PID of the person running the passwd program (
or whichever program is being used anyways).

There are tons of one-way hashing functions.  If you think about it,
even inaccurate divisions and multiplications can be considered 
"one-way", so long as the innaccuracies vary enough.

It is also not always best to have a large change in data when someone
changes a small piece of their data.  It should not make the ciphertext
visible, though. :)

I'd suggest looking around at that ftp site for some of their postscript
files.  There are quite a few other sites like that, except that
their names skip my mind right now.  One in particular I am thinking
of makes you first become a ergistered ftp user before you are able to
ftp any soruce or programs...  Surely someone else here would know...

Finally, is it really necessary to chaneg the current method of password
encryption?

There is one other reason you didn't mention, but I think is very important.

If someone has built brute-force DES cracking machines, the odds are that they
optimized the silicon carefully (after all, they need lots of quick chips to
get lots of solutions). This means that the multi-million $$$ hardware probably
couldn't handle an oddball encryption that interleaved rounds of two different
algorithms.

And without hardware support there isn't much chance of anyone cracking
a cipher as complex as DES or IDEA.

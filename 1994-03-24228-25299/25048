What a GOOD pointer. I just now glanced at it. Thanks, Mike. I withdraw all
my comments on this topic until I've read the chapter. If I don't come back
on this subject it means I accept the arguments of those who say you can't
do the job by brute force against commonly long keys with today's technology
and typical good algorithms.

(As it happens I bought the book and haven't yet read it. Stupid me.)

Best;
David

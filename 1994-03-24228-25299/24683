Clearly the law in the US permits the discussion of patent details
(for patents which have been issued).  Patents are explicitly a PUBLIC
disclosure of the details of an invention, specifically to instruct
others in the art of the patent.  The patent holder gets economic
protection of the invention for a limited time (17 years) in exchange
for this public disclosure.

Mr. James may be confusing patent protection with trade secret
protection; note, though, that the subject of a patent which has been
issued cannot be a trade secret by definition, since the public
disclosure in the patent means that it is no longer a secret.  This is
one of the difficult trade-offs that must be made by an inventor: try
to maintain something "forever" as a trade secret; or go for patent
protection which (1) will expire in 17 years and (2) instructs others
in the art so that they may invent derivatives.

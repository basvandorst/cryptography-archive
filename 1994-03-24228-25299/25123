The time to *decrypt* increases with the *cube* of the key size in
most implementations.  This means going from a 512 bit key to 1280
bits slows you down by more than a factor of 10.  If a 512 bit
decryption takes a few seconds (typical for medium speed PC's), then a
1280 bit key would take on the order of a minute, making it unpleasant
for interactive use.

One of my friends had an interesting question, I figured I'd ask
some fellow info-junkies and see what you came up with.

Here is the question/problem:

My friend, we'll call him Bob, has decided to start selling widgets.
Now, these widgets are information based, his problem is that the
sale of said widgets break a couple of copyright laws in this country
(Canada). So how does Bob Anonymous market his data to various businesses
and individuals, as well as recieve payment from them--without anyone
nasty being able to find him?

I suggested that he use some kind of "mail forwarding" or "remailing"
service in another country. And then have that sent to a post office box
here in Canada. They could just send money orders instead of cash.

All of this wouldn't be an issue if anonymous digital banks existed today.
That and the whole world was "wired" to the internet. The sad fact is
he's likely going to have to do this via the postal system.

That's my idea. Problem is, how does one find these kind of mail services
in another country? We're not talking e-mail here. Anyone have an FAQ on
this?

I'm sure there must be a better way of handling this problem. I'm going
to post this several newsgroups and then will follow up with the best
solutions people can come up with. I look forward to hearing some
interesting ideas.

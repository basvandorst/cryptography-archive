I know this is a newbie question, but here goes....

If DES derives it's security from non-linear substitutions, and IDEA 
derives its' strength from multiple linear operations, wouldn't an 
algorithm splicing DES like non-linear substitutions into the IDEA
routines make it stronger than either?  Is there anything about the 
IDEA cipher that would prevent this from being possible, or would
it just be a mess to code?

Thanks in advance,

Ragnar Danneskjold

I recently downloaded the source to PGP 2.3a and came across the Zip
compression/decompression routines.

I would like to use these routines in a PD tool I am developing, and I
am wondering where are any more updated (or recent) sources to the Zip
compression?  (ie. a ftp site?)

Also, does anybody know of any other compression routines which have
similar speed and compression ratio characteristics?

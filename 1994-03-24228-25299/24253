I am looking for src (before I write my own)  that would
take a text file, and sort through, and show some kind
of lettter frequency..  
I would then like to apply to the same file that has been xor'd with
a random length of random numbers..  

Basically, Im trying to figure out a way to crack xor'd files.
if someone can offer some suggestions or src code especially, i would
appreciate it.

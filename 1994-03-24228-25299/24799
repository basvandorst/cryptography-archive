: These two letters are the basis for Mr. James statement in Message-ID:
: <9403160551.AA02871@nyx10.cs.du.edu>  that is sent him "prodigious private
: email". I would be very interested to know what dictionary Mr. James uses,
: because clearly we does not appear to be using a common vocabulary based
: on Standard American English.

The same one St3rnlight uses to show that around 1% is 'many'? ;-)

As net.bozos go, I think I preferred St3rnlight.  This Rt Rev C James III Esq
character, though sharing some of St3rnlight's technique, has none of his
saving graces.

PS Anyone on sci.crypt who has saved old postings of St3rnlight's best
moments here, could you drop me some mail please?  Most of our archives
for the forthcoming St3rnlight FAQ are from after he shifted his attention
to comp.org.eff.talk ... Thanks.
PPS Richard - maybe he means 'Prodigous' meaning "Your postings appear
to be the work of a veritable prodigy" :-)

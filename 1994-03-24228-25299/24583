I disagree with the idea that we *should* use standards, based
upon the fact that standards make attacking cyphers easier.
If the entire world uses one standard, now matter how strong,
the cryptoanalysts in the opposition can concentrate their
attack on the single cypher (in the extreme of standardization).
All examples prior to modern cyphers indicate that eventually
they find finger-holds which allow extracting some kind of
important information.

Even if they can't crack it, a small number of cyphers makes
the job of administering a cryptoanalytic center much easier.
If the keys are gotten in some other way, there is no question
of how to apply them.

I believe that a globally-secure crypto system, e.g. one which
includes everybody on the Internet, should aim for diversity,
because this overloads the administration of any cryptoanalytic
effort.  It also should put into use many different *classes*
of cyphers, so they can't all be broken at once.  It should
encourage combining different classes of cyphers so that
the sum is much stronger than the components.  This is
a variant of "security by obscurity", which doesn't work
for any individual target if used over time, but works
for individuals if varied a lot and works for a population
of targets.

I am not paranoid. I believe that RSA, etc. are secure, today.
However, I don't believe that any cypher will last forever, and
don't believe anybody can predict when any particular cypher will fail.
It is not prudent to depend on a single anything if you want
fail-safe systems.

Oh,  by the way:  I don't know about Ida, but I'd never trust an executable
which  is  approved  by a few bytes of email header only.  Executing it may
render  Idas  computer  useless, or insecure.  Imagine one sends her a fake
executable  installing  a  keyboard  capture  hack,  which  tells her (when
executed) that the message got damaged and could not be decrypted anymore.

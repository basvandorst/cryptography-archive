Yes.  See Alfred J. Menezes "Elliptic Curve Public Key Cryptosystems"
Klewer Academic Publishers, 1993  ISBN 0-7923-9368-6

>What are the advantages/disadvantages?

More security per bit of key.
Different than RSA.
More computation time per bit of key unless you have a GF coprocessor.

>Has it been used in a commercial application?

Almost.  I think NeXt tried, but patent problems may have nixed that
implementation.

>Is it patented? 

RSADSI *CLAIMS* that ALL public key crypto is patented by them.

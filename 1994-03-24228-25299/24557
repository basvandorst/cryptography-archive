But there are two ways of looking at the term `commercial use'.

1)  Using the patented *algorithm* to produce s/w which is then sold.

2)  Using the resultant *s/w* in a commercial environment to send commercial
    traffic.

Assuming definition 1 then free PGP may be used by anyone for any purpose and
ViaCrypt would have had to apply for a licence to sell a commercial product
based on IDEA.

Assuming definition 2 then free PGP could be used only to send non-commercial
messages and ViaCrypt-PGP (presumably) comes with an implicit licence allowing
the user to send commercial messages.

Whether 1 or 2 is the right interpretation, we nevertheless have an explicit
assurance by Phil that PGP may be used for commercial traffic.  From the docs:

  | There is no license fee required for noncommercial use of IDEA.  Ascom
  | Tech AG has granted permission for PGP to use the IDEA cipher, and places
  | no restrictions on using PGP for any purpose, including commercial use.

Either way it would appear that PGP may indeed be used for commercial traffic.

 Personally, I need help with THAT. More specifically, I need to find a
 third party shareware/freeware library that is better than the standard
 C graphics libs.

 I bought a book a while back that detailed 3D graphics programming,
 albeit not very well. I never could get the author's examples to work,
 and, quite frankly, he had a horrible explanation.

 I'm sure there are graphics tutors and libraries out there on Internet.
 Maybe someone will point them out to us?




... If it wasn't for C, we would be using BASI, PASAL and OBOL!

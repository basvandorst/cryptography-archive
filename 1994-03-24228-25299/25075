Colin, I don't think he's flaming you.  Nothing he said is not based on a desire
to help you substantiate your many claims.  You remain unwilling, ( Or, I truly suspect, _unable_ ) to explain how "...Jenkins' code infringes on your patent?".

Peter's request is not a flame, but a reasonable request.  e.g., you are saying
"You can't use it", but not answering the question of, "Why not?" .  

I have saved many posts just like this one, and I have obtained a great deal
of illumination from many other posts on a wide variety of legal and technical
aspects of your patent.  From you, I have received almost nothing except,
"Your idea infringes on my patent."
"So does yours."
"So does his."
"So do theirs."
"So does that."
etc,
and...
"I'm not gonna tell you, because..."
	"...I'm too busy"
	"...you were rude."
	"...you sent me two [prolific] e-mails." 
	"...You're too stupid to read the patent."

You remind me of little mikey newman from third grade.

- By the way, as you seem to have had trouble correctly identifying it in 
the past, let me help you...
			"This is flame."

I'll be going to the mall, now.  (??)

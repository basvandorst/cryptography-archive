    Factorization can be trivially shown to be in NP.  However it is
not known to be NP-complete, and it is certainly not known whether or
not it is in P.

   A better statement might be that not all instances of the knapsack
problem are hard (in fact most are easy), and the encoding technique
only chose easy to solve knapsacks. (To use it as a cipher you need a
unique solution, and using that information helps in the solution.)

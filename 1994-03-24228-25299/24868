I can't even send you the PGP FAQ,
since AOL cuts mail off at 24K. I've
sent you my "Here's How to MacPGP!"
guide (~20K) but no way is someone going
to mail you the program. Use your modem
to call a BBS and download PGP:

    BBS sites:
      Hieroglyphics Vodoo Machine (Colorado)
      DOS version only
      (303) 443-2457
      Verified: 26-Dec-93
      
      Colorado Catacombs BBS
      (303) 938-9654
      
      Exec-Net (New York)
      Host BBS for the ILink net.
      (914) 667-4567

Also send mail to pgpinfo@mantis.co.uk for
access and general info about PGP.

Better yet, get the hell off AOL, or at least
make a real internet provider your main
internet connection. The only use AOL has is
that it's easy to keyword search for Mac
software. Then you have to download it at
2400 baud, at $3.50 an hour. Ha ha ha ha!

P.S. Non-AOLsters, send me mail with Subject
"Bomb me!" for Gary Estrom's PGP FAQ and my
"Here's How to MacPGP!" guide, both of which
will help any newbie get and use PGP, the free
public key encryptor designed by Phil Zimmermann.
The guides are also available for ftp to
ftp.netcom.com in /pub/qwerty.

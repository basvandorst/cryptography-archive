I agree that this would be nice.  I agree that it may not be possible.
However, I would guess that any weakness in the hash that reveals
information about the input ALSO helps provide a way to find two
messages with the same hash.

In any case, all of the cyrptographic hash functions that I know of
seem to obey the property that the output reveals no information about
the input (other than the fact that the output is the hash of the
input).

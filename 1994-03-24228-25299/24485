That is false.  I wrote to RSA Data Security, informed them I had PGP
and desired to use it, and asked if they had any claims or objections to
make.  They responded with material which included the statement that
their policy is that anybody may use the RSA algorithm for personal,
intellectual, or educational purposes.  They did not send any assertion
of infringement.

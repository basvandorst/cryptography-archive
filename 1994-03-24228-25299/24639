My understanding of British law is that you can discuss patented ideas
and even implement them - so long as you do not deny the patent holder
of expected commercial benefit, (eg implementing the patented 'invention'
when you would otherwise have purchased and used an implementation licensed
by the patent holder).

US law I expect to be similar.

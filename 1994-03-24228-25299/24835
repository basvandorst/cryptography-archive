  > What is El Gamal?

   It's a what and a who, actually.

   A signature scheme used in public-key cryptography,
derived from a modification of exponentiation
ciphers proposed by ElGamal [ELGA85].

scheme based on discrete logarithms," IEEE Transactions on
Information Theory, Vol. IT-31, No. 4, July 1985, pp. 469-472.

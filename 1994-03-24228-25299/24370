Silverman usually gets away with being so arrogant and condescending because
he's usually right --- however, in this case he's dead wrong, and the
original poster is right (at least for the point quoted above).  Yes, the
correct word in the middle of those two expressions is "implies".  They
are *NOT* different notation for the same thing.  More particularly,
   a [congruent] r (mod n)   DOES NOT IMPLY    a mod b = r.

This was pointed out in the original posting, and why you aren't seeing
this is beyond me....   It is certainly true that 4 [congruent] 7 (mod 3)
since 4 and 7 are in the same equivalence class modulo 3.  However,
4 mod 3 does *NOT* equal 7, which would have to be the case if these
two things were "merely different notation for the same thing."

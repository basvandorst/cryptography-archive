     This is the so-called "infinity bug."  This made use of a peculiarity
     of telephone systems using Strowger switch gear.  As yet, nobody
     who has made an infinity bug for touch-tone systems has come
     forward to talk about it.  I can't remember the exact reasons, but
     I think that the switchhook of a Strowger system always has a 
     significant voltage across it, but this is not the case for the touch-tone
     system.

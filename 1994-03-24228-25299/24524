I believe that this is wrong. 
Commercial use of IDEA(tm) requires a licence. The terms of the licence will 
vary according to use proposed. However, both types of use you describe will 
require a licence from ASCOM.

Would Microsoft (or anyone else) spend money to deveop a product for you to 
use it without payment to make money (or assist in the making of money for
yourself. Think about it.

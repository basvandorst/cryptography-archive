ZyXEL modems can record usable voice with a DTE as low as 9600bps.  Good
quality voice over a 14.4Kbps link should be no problem.  Unfortunately,  
the current model ZyXELs use the second DSP for touch tone interpretation 
so for duplex is not possible.  If there is a market they (and other 
makers) may implement full duplex voice in the modem.  All you would have 
to do is run the data stream across a good crypto program and you could 
get a secure voice link.

I don't want to make this discussion more heated than it is, but I have to
say Ken Pizzini was correct.  The typical use of "mod" in math textbooks
is really different from the usage of "mod" by computer scientists.  

Computer scientists usually use "mod" to refer to a function:

	x mod m =(def) r such that 0 <= r < m and m|(x-r)

In typical mathematics textbook usage, "mod" is not an operator, it is _part_
of the _notation_ for a ternary relation:

	x [congruent] r (mod m)

is another way of writing

	m|(x-r)

Note that neither the congruence symbol nor "mod" alone means anything.  They
have to be used in combination to refer to the congruence relation.

Hope that this settles the issue once and for all.

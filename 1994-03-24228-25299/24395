Just a brief note to folks on sci.crypt --

My recent posts here (other than those cross-posted
from eff.talk) were the result of me replying to email,
apparently from a mailing list that feeds to this group.

I was not aware my replies would be posted.  This is
not a problem, except that my comments may have
appeared to be non-sequiturs or given without sufficient
context.

(An aside, I'm still interested in the topic of how to generate
large numbers (e.g. thousands) of" truly" random keys.)

Thanks.

Steve

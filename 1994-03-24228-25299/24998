I don't know. It hasn't been demonstrated yet to my satisfaction (not that
anyone is obigated to satisfy me). To make this point one has to do the
numbers for current PCs likely to be in wide use, with current key lengths,
and current acceptable encryption and decryption times, and compare that to
the kind of massively parallel processor at state-of-the-art speeds a rich
cryptologic orgnaization is likely to be able to have today. Hand-waving at
the aggregate level won't cut it.

FIrst of all, you don't say how much longer that would take to encrypt or
decrypt with current PCs and whether that would be over the limit or not.

Second of all, though it's not as useful because it only gives you one
message at a time, there's the direct cracking of IDEA, TDES, etc. given the
way public key crypto works.

Finally, if you're making an argument about "some day", then I agree that
maybe some day, though it depends on other assumptions you do or don't make.

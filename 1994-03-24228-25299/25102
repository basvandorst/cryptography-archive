I have never flamed Colin James, and, in spite of the tone of his
message, I won't start now.  In fact, I'll buy Mr. James lunch
(up to $20.00), if he'll just (please) explain exactly how Jenkins'
code infringes on his patent.

P.S.:  I don't feel ashamed to be listed with any of the above names,
       because, as far as I'm aware, none of them has posted a single
       inappropriate flame.

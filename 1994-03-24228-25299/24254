Might I suggest that whatever law enforcement can get access to (and I'm
not limiting this to Federal agencies), so can organized crime?  You merely
have to know who to buy.  Same holds true for large corporations (of course
some are also controlled by organized crime).  And given recent events, foreign intelligence services (France openly admits industrial espionage in support of
its industries, and similar roles have been suggested for the CIA). Law
enforcement agencies aren't above using surveillance for political rather than
legal ends - just look at J. Edgar Hoover.  Why take someone to court with illegally obtained evidence when you can simply drop them enough hints to blackmail
them into always supporting you.  If necessary, there have always been ways to
make good on the threats of exposure without being directly linked. Information
can be power, and that is a commodity many are interested in and willing to use
extreme means to obtain and keep.

I am looking into HW implementations for cryptographic algorithms. While
there seem to be some papers on custom/semi-custom VLSI implementation,
I can't find any literature dealing with implementations using FPGAs or
similar technology. So either I am not looking in the right places, or
nobody has tried implementing cryptographic algorithms on these beasts
before, or people have tried but figured it doesn't work well. Anybody
out there who could enlighten me? Any pointers are welcome. Thanks for
your help in advance.

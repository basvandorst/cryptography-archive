	Factorization is not known to be NP. If the NSA had proven that
NP=P, that would a pretty horrible breakthrough to keep secret. If there
was an encryption algorithm that had been proven to require the solution
of an NP-complete problem to crack, I'd feel pretty safe.

	Wasn't there a PK method using the napsack problem that was
broken? (not by finding a polynomial time solution for the napsack
problem, but by finding a weakness in the way that the napsack problem
was used as a cipher)

        If you mean the PASSWORD command, I believe that it simply
        uses some of the unused space in the directory entry to flag
        the file as password-read-only.  An aquaintance claims to
        have got password-protected files back just by using Norton
        or similar on the directory entry.  Not having a copy of
        DR-DOS to hand I can't check this out, so apologies if I'm
        wrong on this.

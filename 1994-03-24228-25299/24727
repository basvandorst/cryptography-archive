The basic flaw with interleaving algorithms rather than
consecutively applying them is that interleaved DES is *NOT* DES.

We do know that random changes to the DES s-boxes will likely
weaken the algorithm.  It is also likely that whatever algorithm
that results after interleaving will be weakened too.  In any event
interleaving DES and IDEA results in something that is *not* either.

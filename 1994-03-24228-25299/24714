Peter K Boucher writes "it does not use Knuth's algorithm M, which is
what James appears to dislike."

Nothing I write implies any such thing;  Mr Boucher is putting words
in my mouth.

Knuth's Algorithm M (vol 2, p 32) "Randomizing by shuffling" is based
on MD MacLaren and G Marsaglia [JACM 12(1965), 83-89; CACM 11(1968),
759].  

Why would I patent something by MacLaren or Marsaglia, and over 25
years old at that.

Also, why not just post the source code so readers could see if
they're interested in saving the message rather than force them to
tinker with it in a number of additional steps just to decompress it.

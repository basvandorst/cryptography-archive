Ask and ye shall receive. I have already filed a second Commodity
Jurisdiction request with State, this one for a floppy containing
*exactly* the same information that appears in Part Five of Applied
Cryptography (the source code). It's CJ case number 081-94. You
can read it from ftp.cygnus.com in /pub/export/applied-floppy-cjr.

Note that it is *not* for the original 2-disk set that Bruce Schneier
has been shipping. So as to not complicate the issue, this CJ is for a
new disk that contains *only* the code that's already printed in the
book.

If they say "yes", then they will have established a precedent that
you can make your code exportable in machine readable form by merely
publishing it first in print form. And if they say "no", they will
find themselves having to defend the interesting assertion that only
Americans can type. And I suspect that either ruling will be
newsworthy, something they don't seem to like.

The idea is to keep on patiently slicing through the baloney, molecule
by molecule, until it becomes utterly transparent even to a government
bureaucrat. :-)

This CJ process is much like chess-by-mail. Even when you're two moves
away from checkmating your opponent, you still have to wait for the
mail delivery. And there's always the risk that your opponent
will be a sore loser. :-)

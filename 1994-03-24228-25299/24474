As I do not have the resources to test and find out myself
about cryptation/decryptation software I would be interested
to know about the experience so far: If you e.g. encrypt a file
with one program in one computer, transfer the file to another
of different make, and use a different software to decrypt the
file, would you get the original plain text file as a result?
Please tell about software products which are compatible in this
sence resp. incompatible! I remember sometimes having tried basicly
the same software between a PC and a host (it was either a VAX or
some Unix machine - that was many years ago, however) and remind
that there were some problems, probably because of the different
file structure in the computers. The transfer worked somehow in one
direction but not the other.

My suspection is that in general different products (especially comercial)
are not compatible even if they all claim to use the same algorithm, am I
right. Especially the compatibility of software using RSA for electronic
signatures would be nice to hear about.

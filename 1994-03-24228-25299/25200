You sure can.  You just build a command file with the calls to PGP
in it, then choose the "Run Command File" option (or whatever it's called)
from the menu.  You can use any arguments that you can use from the DOS or
UNIX command line.  Just slightly inconvenient (and officially "unsupported"),
but it seems to work fine.

I briefly looked at this 8K-byte ciphertext-only challenge... doesn't look
like a state-of-the-art algorithm, because there's some strong regularity
in the output.  I ran index of coincidence for up to trial period 520, and
sorted by IC.  Trial periods of powers of two up to 256 show a strong
peak -- here are the highest 10 of the 520 trial periods:

	Period 369: average ic = 0.004443
	Period 322: average ic = 0.004450
	Period   8: average ic = 0.004481
	Period 482: average ic = 0.004487
	Period 492: average ic = 0.004548
	Period  16: average ic = 0.004950
	Period  32: average ic = 0.005464
	Period 256: average ic = 0.005642
	Period  64: average ic = 0.006503
	Period 128: average ic = 0.006719

This appears to indicate a period or block-size of some power of 2 with
inadequate mixing.  Looks to me like it's not worth the trouble to invest
a lot of time up front...  I think I'll wait for the algorithm to be posted.

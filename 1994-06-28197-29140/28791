Hi,

Pardon if this is too basic.  I am helping with some programming; in our
data sets, which will be widely distributed, we wish to include a "checksum"
type of thing, that will reveal whether the data has been corrupted.  This
means that I need to find a good algorithm for generating this signature
based on the contents of the file.  We want a good one.  Is there any sort of
ftp site that has code like this, or can someone tell me what I need to
do?  Thanks.

Vicki

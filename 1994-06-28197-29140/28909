  The book is a reprint of Appendix 8 of Military Cryptanalytic
Part 2 - Volume 2 by Callimahos and Friedman.   They also blow up
the type size about 4 times to make it easier to follow.

From the Introduction...
----------
The Zendian Problem, presenting an operational communication
intelligence 
situation in miniature, afford opportunity to apply the techniques of

traffic analysis and cryptanalysis, to derive intelligence and to 
prepare reports.  This problem deals with the enemy communications
during 
an amphibious operation against Zendia, an island in the Pacific
located 
approximatly 2,000 miles west of Peru, with an area of 990,000 sq.
miles 
and a population of 17,320,000.  Zendia is a totalitarian state under
the 
absolute dictatorship of Marshal Salvo Salassio, the Prime Minister,
who 
embarked upon a series of high-handed actions which led to an
ultimatum 
by the UN Security Council;  this ultimatum was rejected by Salasio. 

The US, acting under the authority of the UN, assembled Task Force
Pearl 
and embarked upon Operation Seahorse which had as it's objectives the

establishment of an occupation force to liberate the Zendian people
from 
the Salasio regime, with a restoration of the true Zendian republic.

   After more history you get almost 100 pages of fine print with 
messages in a variety of unknown cryptosystems, digest of operator 
chatter, callsign listings, frequency listings, everything except
some 
know-it-all Lt. saying "you aren't done yet?!"

 do not understand how clipper works? You need to be able to
 interconenct any two clipper phones - without prior secret
 communication. Each session has its own key and teh key is exchanged
 somehow using the  secret escrowed key. But how in the world does the
 phone at the other end know anythignabout the escrowed key of the first
 phone? I assume that this is not public key crypto. How do they do it?

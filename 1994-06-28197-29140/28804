The checksum if formed from the session key, among other things.  So,
it contains information about that key.  In addition, if all the other
variables are known to an attacker, in theory they can reduce the
checksum to 16 bits of information about the session key (although
probably not 16 actual bits of the session key.)  Even though the
rogue LEAF is mainly junk, it does have to contain a valid checksum
computed from the actual session key (which the verifying chip knows.)  
The other variables involved are probably junk also (such as the serial
number), but it doesn't matter as long as they are known.

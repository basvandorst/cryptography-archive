Where could I find this documentation?  I would like to verify that you are 
not a worthless do-nothing that just hangs out on the net trashing people 
who really do contribute.  It would help if you define contrabution, and 
also if you gave some examples of what you have done.  Please respond to 
this, as I am genuinely interested.  I am, however, slightly put off by your 
method of addressing this, and would like to know if you feel that you can 
judge contrabutions(whatever they are) by someone you don't know.  More 
specifically, if the person is not in the same social club as you, how do 
you know this person has not "contributed"?

I am waiting for your list of contrabutions.

Roger.

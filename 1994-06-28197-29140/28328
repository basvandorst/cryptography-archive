Sort of. The checksums are dependant on the IV and the session key.
Thus, you have to be at the point where you know the session key for
your session to forge a LEAF. If your protocol would permit you to
precompute your session keys you can precompute forged LEAFs at the
same time.

This is in fact a method much like the one Blaze uses.

Yes.

You need no help from the other system -- you can interoperate with
pre-existing equipment that isn't trying to "cheat" using this method.

>How long does it take a Clipper chip to accept or reject a LEAF ?

Matt's paper claims 50ms using Tessera cards connected via a SCSI
PCMCIA reader.

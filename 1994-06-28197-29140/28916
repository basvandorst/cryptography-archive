Sounds like you're describing Bruce Schneier's Blowfish algorithm, which
was published here (Distribution: na :-) and in Dr. Dobbs around April.
They offer a reward for the best attack on either Blowfish or on a
brain-damaged version of it (pick your damage: reduced cycles, reduced
key length, whatever).  I forget what the reward was, but it was for
the most interesting attack rather than for a straight break of the
full system.

If that was _In re Hall_, which concerned whether the appendix to a
thesis on the shelf at Freiburg University in Germany, and which
described the invention Hall wanted to patent, was a "printed
publication" which would defeat Hall's patent, then it is important
to note that the thesis wasn't *just* sitting on the shelf.  It was
also indexed and in the library catalog, so that members of the public
who were interested could reasonably find it.

Other cases have held that things that are not reasonably findable
by the public won't count against the patent.  For example, a manuscript
that has been accepted by a journal editor but not yet published in
the journal has been held not to bar a patent.  In fact, if I recall
correctly, the printing and mailing of the journal is not enough.  It
has to actually have reached at least one subscriber.

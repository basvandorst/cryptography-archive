This was a deliberate compromise for the sake of user friendliness.  It 
means that it privides quick way to quickly eliminate 65535 out of 65536 
bad keys without doing more expensive processing, but with 2^128 keys to 
try, I'm not particularly worried about this help for the cryptanalyst.  
It does allow for the program to be more user friendly about the way 
mis-typed pass phrases are handled when doing conventional encryption.  
Personally, I think it is a good compromise.  On the other hand, if you 
want an encryption program that gives no such help, try dlock or raw 
triple DES...

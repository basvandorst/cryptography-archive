  Nope. O(lg(N)^3), which is much better than O(N^3). Your confusion
comes from mixing N and n=lg(N), the number of bits to represent N.

    Since we can anyway crack RSA in O(N^0.25) using Pollard's Rho
algorithm (and much faster using MPQS etc.) it doesn't make much sense
to try O(N) methods. BTW, N ~ 10^200 as originally recommended and
there is no real upper limit except that imposed by the cost of encryption
and decryption (O(lg(N)^3)).

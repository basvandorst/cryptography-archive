Actually, the original poster brings up an interesting point, how do you
KNOW that a message is random gibberish or in fact contains
information? After all, isn't the purpose of cryptography to
ultimatley make messages look like random gibberish?

But then I digress, because what is nice about public key crypto
is that you can use public channels to provide secure communications.

SOmehow, someone is going to have to know how to decypher the
original posters message, how secure is that transfer of THAT info?

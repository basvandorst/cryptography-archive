As a longtime observer and occasional participant, I assure you there are
many folks in the chip business who could do this.  The problem is THERE 
IS NO MARKET FOR IT.  Clipper has cornered the only 'I order you to use this'
market.  The voluntary market is too small to justify making a knockoff.  

(But this would be a good way for the Russian mfgrs to break into the US 
market, so to speak.  They have more incentive to do a loss entry than any 
one else.)

Much more likely for a chip is a SIO with built in encryption.  
Unfortunately,  if done in the USofA, the NSA will via Commerce's ITARs 
prohibit export.  So, this means innovation in SIOs will be abroad.

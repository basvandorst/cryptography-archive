The author mistakes serenity, self-assurance, and good writing for
reason, a common mistake.

A control of one's temper is an emotional attrribute, not a mental one.
Self-assurance (even outright arrogance) is no indication that the
writer actual knows what he is talking about, only that he *thinks*
he knows that he's talking about.
Well-formed prose is a skill that need not be accompanied by an
ability to reason well, or to understand properly.

In short, *sounding* reasonable is easy to mistake for *being* reasonable,
and it take work and insight to tell the difference.

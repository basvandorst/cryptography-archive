No. What happened was that we had a president candidate that won the popular vote but not the electoral vote. In some states (back then) there were no guideline laws about how the state electoral representatives had to vote. Since then there have been laws/guidelines set forth in each state concerning how an electoral representative must cast his/her vote. I could be wrong since I've lived in only 6 states and Am. Govt. 101 was a number of years back.

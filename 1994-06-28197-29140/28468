Sounds like you're a software developer looking to give people a 'serial
number' which encodes their license info. First, you'll have to employ
'security through obscurity'. In this case, I recommend you allow users to
enter the information, hash it all, and then enter an ascii version of the
hash. If the hash is too long, compress the hash. Your app can check the
hash against what they've entered.

Naturally, if your app can extract the ostid & hostname from the O/S, all
they need enter is the expiration and the asciified hash.

   For those of you out there who may have missed it, the cover story
of the magazine section of the New York Times today was "The Cypherpunks
vs. Uncle Sam", with Whitfield Diffie's picture on the coverpage.  It's
a well written article that covers the latest issues pertaining to 
crypto at length.  
    In any event it's good to see the media increasing the level of     
reporting on cryptography.  Hopefully, with continued exposure, the 
general public will come to understand the Clipper initiative and the 
devastating ramifications to their right to privacy inherent in the 
Government's position, rather than giving the rubber stamp approval that
the Clipper clique seems to have counted on.

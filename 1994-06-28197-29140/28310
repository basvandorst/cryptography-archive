In today's talk here at MIT, Brent Morris and Mark Unkenholz, the NSA
speakers, confirmed what I have previously suggested, namely that the
Skipjack algorithms are the subject of a patent.  This patent is being
witheld from distribution by a patent secrecy agreement, and will be
issued when/if the Skipjack algorithm is successfully reverse
engineered.  Note that by using more than one such patent, and
controlling the declassification/issue dates, the effective
availability of the Skipjack technology can be arbitrarily delayed far
beyond the 17 years of normal patent law.

To xor PRNG output with plaintext is not enough - you have to hide the
'state' of PRNG, otherwise known plaintext attacks are simple. Also 32-bit
is far too few. Try to look into  ftp.dsi.unimi.it /pub/security/crypt/code,
for example.  There are many programs there available.
I have written own program some time ago, which I think is quite strong cipher.
It is also on that server as Jiri_Pittner_cipher.gz

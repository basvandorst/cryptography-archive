  Okay, this is probably stupid, but I've looked through all the
FAQs and none of them mention anything on this.  I know I've
misunderstood something or this would have come up a long time ago.

  What prevents a person from taking the public key for an RSA
encryption, encoding a message, and then trying every d until the
message is decoded?  Since decoding is O(n^3) and there are only n
possibilities for d you get an O(n^4) method of cracking d.  Sure,
there might be a huge constant out in front, but how huge does it
have to be to make this harder than trying to factor n?  This could
probably be done even faster by starting at n-sqrt(n)+2 and going
down since d is usually large.

  The only comments on cracking in the FAQ insist that n must be
factored, or is this a variation on the "find the root" method?

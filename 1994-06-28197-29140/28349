                             FACT SHEET ON
                       DIGITAL SIGNATURE STANDARD
                                May 1994


The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has issued
Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 186, Digital Signature
Standard (DSS).  This fact sheet provides agencies with information
regarding the standard and describes several applications which may
benefit from the DSS.

                               Background

To reduce costs and increase productivity, many federal government
agencies are transforming paper-based systems into automated
electronic
systems.  This trend has brought about a need for a reliable,
cost-effective way to replace a handwritten signature with a digital
signature. Like a handwritten signature, a digital signature can be
used
to identify and authenticate the originator of the information.  A
digital signature can also be used to verify that information has not
been altered after it is signed; this provides message integrity.
The
DSS specifies a Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) for use in
computing
and verifying digital signatures.


            Overview of Cryptographic Integrity and the DSS

Cryptography can be categorized as either secret key cryptography or
public key cryptography.  Secret key cryptography uses a single
cryptographic key shared by two communicating parties.  For secret
key
cryptography to be effective, the cryptographic key must be kept
secret
and controlled only by the parties that have access to the key. FIPS
46-2, "Data Encryption Standard (DES)", defines a secret key
algorithm
to be used by government agencies for encrypting unclassified federal
information in computer applications.

Using the DES, a cryptographic checksum known as a Message
Authentication Code (MAC) can be used to provide message integrity as
specified in FIPS 113, "Computer Data Authentication".  When a key is
shared only between the sender and receiver, the MAC can be used to
identify the sender of the information to the receiver.  However,
implementations of this technology cannot inherently be used to prove
to
a third party that information actually originated from the sender.
Since both the sender of the information and the receiver of the
information share the same key, it is possible that the information
could have originated from either party.

Public key cryptography is a form of cryptography which makes use of
two
keys:  a public key and a private key.  The two keys are
mathematically
related, but the private key cannot be determined from the public

Since I was one of the posters, would like to make it clear that while
I believe that under certain conditions, knowlege of the checksum could
reduce the possible keyspace (from 2^80 to 2^64) for an exhaustive search, 
this is not sufficent to make breaking reasonable (still 2^8 better than 
DES). However and also IMHO since a 32 bit checksum would have materially 
weakened the algorithm and may have made a brute force attack feasible, the 
use of a 16 bit checksum may have been the intelligent result of a trade 
study. 

Unless the NSA makes an announcement, we may never know, however I
DO NOT feel that the use of the "checksum" (if that is what it is) weakens 
the SKIPJACK algorithm materially, only the effectiveness of the LEAF (and 
should the government abandon key escrow, it will not matter).

: A paper can NEVER infringe on a patent. An explicit purpose of the
: patent system is to encourage innovation and development. There is
: a difference between a patent and a trade secret.

: Use of the method outlined in the paper may infringe, but only if
: the courts say that it does. Given the current state of software and
: algorithmic patents, I don't think anybody can reliably predict
: how the courts will decide.

Unless of course the patent is for a process to make paper. The process
used to make the paper for money is an example, although not patented,
it could be. For now, to everyone's chagrin, it remains a state secret...

Well, Crypto '94 hasn't happened yet, as far as I know, so it'll
be a while.  Are preprints available?  Ptherwise, I'll have to 
wait until august and mooch a copy off of Philip Zimmermann
(who I think intends to go).

I'd like to see your arguments and entropy estimator.  I really
should learn about entropy estimation to beef up PGP's true random
number generator with better entropy estimates.  the current
scheme is lamentably ad-hoc.

(Or can I mooch information about it off Peter?  But really, the
horse's mouth is closer.)

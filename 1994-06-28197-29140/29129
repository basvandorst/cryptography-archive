4KHz *is* the bandwidth of a voice call in the telephone network and
this uses 64K bps.  With compression (as used in GSM cellular phones),
this can be squeezed to 16Kbps or 2K bytes per second.  This is just a
bit too fast for a 14.4K modem but you could sacrifice a little
bandwidth and do it.  Sampling, compressing, and encrypting,
decrypting, uncompressing, and playing at this rate might be feasible
for a 486 PC.  You will have problems, however, with latency if you
try to group these samples into blocks but it should be possible to
encrypt them as a stream.

But no, I haven't tried this.

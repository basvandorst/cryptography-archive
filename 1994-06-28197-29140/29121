:The Computer Literacy Bookstore in Tysons Corner, VA outside of

They have some Internet presence -- email info@clbooks.com for more
information.  Computer Literacy is a chain, but all the rest of the
bookstores are in "The Valley".  <sigh>  I damn near wanted to lose
myself in the Computer Literacy bookstore the first time I was there.

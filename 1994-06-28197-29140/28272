	I'm not qualified to design this, but what about an algorithm 
based on the traveling salesman problem? I don't know the latest advances 
in algorithms, so that may have already been ruled out by advances made 
in the recent past. So, all y'all cryptographers out there, would a 
traveling-salesman based pub-key algorithm be workable? Has one been 
invented? If yes, where can I find it? If no, why not?

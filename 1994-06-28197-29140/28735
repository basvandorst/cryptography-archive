: Given C1=E_{KEY1}(M) for some message M, and being able to compute
: c2=E_{KEY2}(M) from C1, would allow you to compute
: M = D_{KEY2}(C2).
: A very undesirable property.

I was under the impression Mr Bixler meant:

Given	c1 = DES(encrypt, k1, m),
	c2 = DES(encrypt, k2, m)
	   = DES(encrypt, k2, DES(decrypt, k1 ,c1)).
Does a function T ("transform keys") exist such that
	c2 = T(c1, k1, k2)
and
	cost of T < cost of (DES(encrypt, k2, DES(decrypt, k1, m)))?

Note that this requires that the operator who wishes to compute
T know the original key (k1).

In which case I
	1. Don't see a blatant vulnerability, but have no doubt
someone else does, and
	2. Would still say "No".

Cheers and jeers,
gene

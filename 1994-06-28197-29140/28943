I don't think their are any cryptanalytic algorithms per se. 
i.e. put a crytosystem or ciphertext in, get a solution or
plaintext out.  Every cryptosystem is different, and every one
is broken independantly.

What we need to understand are the theoretical basis for
constructing and attacking ciphers.  I suspect the best way to
do this would be to reverse-engineer a clipper and find out what
kind of black magic the nsa is up to today. <sigh>

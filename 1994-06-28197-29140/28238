Even worse, Micali is claiming that his patent on fair cryptosystems
(#5,276,737) covers Clipper as well.  In the Wall Street Journal (May 31,
1994, p. B6):

	Mr Micali, whose patent was issued in January, says his patent
	covers the concept of breaking an encryption key into multiple
	parts that are guananteed to work, and are held by escrow
	agents.

It seems to me that Clipper does not guarantee that the multiple parts
will work in anywhere near the same way as his scheme does (see my book
for details); Clipper is simplya secret splitting scheme.  On the other
hand, Micali filed his patent application in Apr 92, a full year before
Clipper became public.

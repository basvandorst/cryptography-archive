Help requested.

Will anyone provide a solution (or a source of a solution) to
this problem.

I need to laser print about 30 million forms each with a unique
number (both in clear and as a barcode). It should not be
possible (or at least take more than a year) for anyone to
"forge" these forms (I don't care if they copy the one they have,
but they must not be able to create new ones). To make it more
interesting I need to publish the rules by which a third party
can verify that the forms they hold are genuine (or at least
copies of genuine forms). To be practical the resultant code
printed on the form should be as short as possible, less than 40
bytes would be nice.

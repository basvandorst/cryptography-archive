No problem - we're from the INternet, and we're here to help you :-)

]I am helping with some programming; in our

]type of thing, that will reveal whether the data has been corrupted.

There are two kinds of corruption - random errors, and deliberate changes.
If you're trying to protect your data against random errors, there are
checksums that can do a good job of error detection and correction for
various kinds of noise; textbooks on data communication or information
theory will talk about these, and textbooks on computer architecture
will at least talk about Hamming Codes, which are error correcting
codes used for detecting and correcting bit errors in computer memory.

Malicious changes are a different problem, because the checksums that are
commonly used for error detection are easy and fast to calculate, so a
Bad Guy could fairly easily make sure his substitute file contains a
comment or other string that can be set to arbitrary values to get the
checksum to come out with the same value as the original checksum,
to make it harder for you to notice.  If this is the problem, you need
cryptographic checksum functions, which are believed to be
exponentially hard to duplicate.  The most popular one of these is MD5,
which you can find in lots of ftp sites - rsa.com is the canonical
one, because Ron Rivest who wrote MD5 is there, but lots of other
sites have it, and it's described in an RFC.

There's a system called TripWire for detecting whether your computer
has been tampered with that calculates MD5 checksums for all the
important files; you may be able to adapt it for your use.

   I finally got into net-dist.mit.edu and read the PGP README file.
   I'm sorry guys, but I don't feel like playing your silly games.  The
   people I need to talk to have 2.3 and the people who only have 2.6 can
   hack their program to read my code.  I just noticed that the export
   restrictions held (13-0 vote) so it's clear that the US government
   really doesn't care about people trying to make a living.

Relax.  PGP 2.6, both the original MIT release and a European emulator
based on 2.3a, is freely available throughout the world.  One anon-ftp
site is black.ox.ac.uk --- look in /src/security

Get your friends to upgrade.  The new version does have some valuable
improvements in my opinion.

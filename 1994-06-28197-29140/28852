:That site is running a secure ftp program. You have to send email to

:README file for the appropriate info.

Tnx, but its the README file that I'm after. I could not find it there,
unless its buried in another directory, for which, *sigh*, I'm waiting for
a ftpmail response from, still.  At this rate, it'll be 4 more weeks to
get the README file. By then, the directory structure and its file names
will likely change on me.  I only want these programs so I can verify
my program against them.

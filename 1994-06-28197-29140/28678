: According to Gus Simmons' article on cryptography in the Encyclopedia
: Britannica, the NSA claims to have discovered two-key cryptography
: in the 1960's but kept it secret.  Details are lacking however.

At the "1st ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security"
held last November in Fairfax Virginia, there was a fest organized
by Whit Diffie in honor of Gus Simmons.  One of the speakers (I don't
recall who) commented that a (recently declassified) executive order
was signed by President John F. Kennedy ordering that launch codes
for nuclear weapons (ICBMs??) were to be safeguarded using a digital
electronic scheme which was clearly a two-key cryptographic method.
Those who were part of that establishment seemed unsurprised about
the comment; it certainly sounds like the technology was well-enough
established to be put into place by the early 1960s.

Those who don't like escrow are, indeed, helped by this, One may now have an
NSA-certified secure system without key escrow.

Of course that leaves the bogeyman under the bed crowd still crying "I won't
trust it until I see the algorithm".

If they ever get to see the algorithm, they'll then cry "Everybody knows how
smart the NSA is--they've probably hidden a trapdoor so we can't find it."

When the President says "No they haven't" they'll then say "What did you
expect him to say?" or "He was probably duped."

When it is revealed that they algorithm was actually written by Phil
Zimmermann while in John Perry Barlow's apartment, they'll say "We knew all
along that Zimmermann and Barlow were just extremely clever NSA fronts.

And when the government disbands the NSA and FBI, they'll go looking for it
in the Department of Agriculture building.

There's simply no way to satisfy some people.

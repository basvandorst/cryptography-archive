I just wish to caution that while DES has been shown to be a
non-group as a whole, my understanding is that it has not been
proven that there does not exist a subset of keys which form a
group among themselves.  So, while the contention quoted above
is true for the general case, it may be for special cases of
KEY1 and KEY2 that there exists a KEY3 such that DES(KEY2, P) =
DES(KEY3, DES(KEY1, P)).

Hardly a cryptographic requirement - why not just take the
strong encryption of your choice (PGP, some implementation of
DES etc) and write a batch/script file to adapt it to the
situation?

For instance, if I recall, pgp will take a passphrase in an
environment variable (a dangerous, but useful feature).  Write a
script to take the first argument as the key, set the key in the
appropriate environment variable, and then call pgp with options
to put it in batchmode and to take the key from the environment
(check the docs).  Good luck.

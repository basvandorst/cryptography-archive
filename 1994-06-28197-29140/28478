	'Cuz you can't export it - it's only worth doing if you can tap 
into the overseas market. I can see someone writing a fossil driver that 
incorporates this. It would have to be a fossil driver, or yo would be 
stuck with a bbs program or two that supports it, and maybe one modem 
program. If it's a fossil driver, however, you can simply run your modem 
program or bbs software through the driver. Said driver would be PD, of 
course.
	Hurricane, who would write that driver if he could code for shit.

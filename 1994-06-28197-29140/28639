I just got my copy through our employee purchase plan. The book is obviously
still available from the Publisher at $60.00 list. I am quite tickled with
this hefty 1164 page book. The only two things that I was disappointed in
so far, was (1) there are great photos of everything else, but none
of the Enigma machine (there is one early commercial diagram however).
(2) is a comment in general on the way the pages are cut on the
side opposite the spine. It resembles a corrigated cut, which makes it
very difficult for flipping through chapters. I guess, its a
special binding feature, but I'm not fond of it myself.

The book looks like it covers just about everything, although it appears
its treatment on the Enigma is less than I would have hoped for. 
Theres a lot of great reading in there, and it obviously represents an
enormous amount of compile effort. Its a definite "gotta own" book.

Its going to take me months to get through this one.

This is one of the standard ways to use a block cipher (or hash function)
as a pseudorandom number generator.  It looks like a counter mode stream
cipher that is as strong as MD5.  If the user-provided random data has at
least 128 bits of entroy to it, then I am not aware of any problems with
this approach.  This has the advantage that knowing one block of output
doesn't help you find any other block of output, unless you can invert the
MD5 function. It is also faster than using a more complex function than
simple incrementing to change the state of the pseudorandom number
generator.

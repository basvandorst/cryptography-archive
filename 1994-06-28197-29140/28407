Has anyone examined the RSAREF random number generator?

It takes a block of user-provided random data and MD5's it to get a
16-byte hash. The hash is then used as the "state" of the generator.
Each time it needs random numbers, it MD5's the existing state and
then increments the state by one, treating the whole 16 bytes as an
unsigned integer. This method is used to generate RSA keys and secret
keys for ciphers up to triple-DES. What do you think of this approach?

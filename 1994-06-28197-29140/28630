Well, some of the code I wrote (IDEA in C, 8086, 68000, SHS in 68000,
MD5 in C and 68000, GOST) and it's in the public domain.  So there are
no copyright issues *there*, at least.

Now, due to my proximity to PGP and legal issues, it would be a spectacularly
bad idea for me to fire it off across the atlantic myself, but if
someone has gt it across there, I'd like to know so I can point others
at it.

(Peter Gutmann wrote the SHS in C, and that's PD, too.)

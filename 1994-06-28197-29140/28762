I think this misses the point, if there is information in the checksum, it 
does nothing to give you the session key.  I have not seen anything that 
says the session key is random, though, and I thought they even went to the 
point of *NOT* *SAYING* how the session key is generated(which says a lot:-)


I put my original ideas out in a verry fuzzy way, and as writen the original 
post is false.  Sorry I didn't think more before I posted.

Thanks for the clarifications.


Roger.

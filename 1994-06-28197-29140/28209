Enough of the mindless propaganda. Though Dan Quale's grammar and spelling
skills may leave something to be desired, that doesn't make him a dunce.

How easy it is for those who contribute nothing to savage another's

(I am not a supporter of Quayle, and don't think I'd vote for him even if he
were the nearest shelter in a snowstorm, but fair is fair.)

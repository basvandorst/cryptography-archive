   Bob,
     I just received a catolog from Aegean Park Press which is for the
most part devoted to books on cryptography.  They have everything from
historical cryptography works, to recently de-classified military
cryptanalytics guides.  A random sampling of a few of their books include
:
     Military Cryptanalytics I to IV by William Fiedman
     Elements of Cryptanalysis
     Elementary Cryptography and Cryptanalysis
     Etc....
 
      Note, I don't believe Agean is a book store per se, but instead
only sells those books they publish themselves (I had been hoping to find
Kahn's "Codebreakers" but no luck...).   Anyway to reach them:
 
          Aegean Park Press
          P.O. Box 2837
          Laguna Hills, CA 92654
 
          Telephone: 1-800-736-3587
 
   Hope this helps,
    Dan Saltzman

I don't know how it works but it works like it generates a pseudo-OTP
that can be used for about 2-4 hours of conversation before recycling
through the pad.

There are not too many folks here in .us who know much about it as
GSM is, so far, pretty much confined to Europe and parts of the Pacific
Rim.  Maybe a euro-poster could give a much better description?? :)

Those areas outside of Nato (ie. Asia) have to use A5A, a crippled
version of A5 that works like it recycles throught the pad every few
minutes.  This reduction of security thanks to the Friends of Big Brother.

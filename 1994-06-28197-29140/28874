The most thorough treatment is in 

	`Machine cryptography and modern cryptoanalysis'
	CA Deavours, L Kruh, Artech House 1985 ISBN 0-89006-161-0

and if you can't get hold of that, there is a chapter on the subject in

	`Cipher Systems'
	HG Beker, F Piper, Northwood 1982 ISBN 0-7198-2571-7

Both of these books not only describe the mechanism, but also show how to
break M-209 encrypted traffic (and give worked examples).

Hope this helps,

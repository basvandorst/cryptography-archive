Yes but the gov would have to be terminally brain damaged to do so. Security 
by obscurity may work for a while but is always revealed eventually (by a 
disgruntled employee, a researcher, or just a hacker).

The most likely results of such a trapdoor would be as follows:
1) Discovered before hardware released - no-one would buy it
2) Discovered in a few years - 40,000,000 purchasers would be very mad
3) Discovered by an "unfriendly power" - nothing nice.

All would result in egg-on-the-face for the Clinton administration.

Besides, IMHO they do not need any back or trap doors to accomplish the 
government's mission so putting one in would just leave them open to the 
above and gain nothing (unless the NSA wanted to embarass the 
administration and I tend to doubt that).

As a consequence, I do not believe there are any deliberate back or trap 
doors in Skipjack/Clipper/Capstone simply because the gov has more to lose 
than we do (didn't we go through this a year ago ?) and they just are not 
that dumb (different priorities than we might think, but not dumb).

	On a side note, does anyone know about the key exchange
algorithm used in tessera?? I'd be surprised if it wasnt' covered
by one of PKP's patents. Isn't that something that someone who
observed the exchange might be able to determine? Wouldn't a
d-h or derivative key exchange be recognizable to an expert, if
they used something like that? Presumably the gov't can ignore
PKP's patents, but it's got to make you wonder.

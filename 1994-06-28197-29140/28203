 PGP is useful in that it allows keys to be delivered easily.  But
 PGP does not provide security against network spoofing unless its
 users actually validate the keys they use.  How many users do?

 The simple use of PGP does not make communications secure.  E-mail
 security on The Network requires that each user validate public keys
 before use.  Since most users will never understand the reason for
 key validation ("It's a PUBLIC key, isn't it?  And, hey, didn't
 somebody swear that the key was good?  Isn't that their public-key
 SIGNATURE?"), it would be a mistake to say that PGP makes secure
 communications practical for everybody.

 (Just how much cash--or intimidation--would it take to get somebody
 to sign false keys?  Just how much effort would be required to
 pervert a key-server?  And how would this investment compare to
 the cost of attacking RSA keys?)

 A manual, ad-hoc and irritating key-validation process might be
 to contact the user through a true separate channel.  A phone
 conversation would be nice, if one has a real name for the other
 end, and can look up the number; this should detect the vast
 majority of spoofing attempts.  But there is always a possibility
 that one will end up speaking to the spoofer . . . .  That would
 not matter if one intends to create no secrets, but in that case,
 why would one use cryptography?

 Since public keys can be knowingly exposed (and validity then
 transferred to new keys), validation must occur repeatedly,
 periodically; not just once.  And even validation is not going
 to help an *un*knowingly exposed public key.

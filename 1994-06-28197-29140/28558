It is a concern though and here is why.  If you send a message with a
spoofed LEAF and the distant end replies with an unmodified system that
sends a valid LEAF, that Leaf from the distant end will have your *shared*
session key imbedded in it encrypted with the unique and family keys as
described in FIPS-185. Then all the Law enforcement officials have to do is
to use the shared session key from the other party (obtained through the
legal escrow system) to decrypt your side of the conversation. Under this
system they not only get one side, but they get both sides of the
conversation as a bonus.  

Since FIPS-185 describes the system and part of the system is the sharing
of a session key, the devices that implement the system will support this.
If you and the people you are communicating with are using one of the
products that have this feature embedded in the chip itself, it may be very
hard to disable. You may not be the subject of a court ordered wire tap, it
may be the person you are communicating with.

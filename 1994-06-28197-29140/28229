Would it be possible to write a program that would work on top of
existing modem programs like TELIX which, upon connecting to another
system/BBS (whatever), send a PGP public key and have the other system
do the same?  And then encrypt all of the data with those keys and
have it decrypted at both ends before giving the cleartext output
to the modem program?  Then anyone trying to tap the data would only
see PGP encrypted text being sent.  Does PGP encrypt/decrypt at
57.6 Kbps?  I'd post the question to alt.security.pgp but
someone would probably attack the question and tell me that this
has already been discussed in a FAQ (without telling me where that FAQ is 
to be found, of course).

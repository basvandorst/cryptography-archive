You'd like it if someone else would break the law for you, but
you won't do it yourself..  Why all this "fucking" around?  Most
of the source is freely available, the disks are just a pretty
package.  What exactly is it that you want so badly off these
disks?  Tell us and maybe we can point you in the right
direction.

I'm sure posting those disks would violate either Bruce's or his
publisher's copyright, and neither of them is trying to restrict
the export of crypto, they are just caught up in outdated laws.

Go learn some new swearwords before you grace us with your
presence again.

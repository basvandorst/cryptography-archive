The debate this always sparks is "what shall we call it?"  To my mind
sci.crypt is exactly descriptive of what both this and the moderated
newsgroup are meant for, and a name like "sci.crypt.research" only
suggests that sci.crypt is meant to have all this junk in it.  I agree
100% with the person who suggested

sci.crypt.moderated

Note also that the moderater *must* live outside the USA!  I seem to
remember Paul Leyland volunteering once, sounds good to me.

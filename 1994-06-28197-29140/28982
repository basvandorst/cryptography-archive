Point taken.  I am still quite impressed with the book in general.  It
appears to be more thorough on the subject in general, than anything
else I've been able to scare up. Not to mention that it reads easy 
since Kahn manages to keep content and reader interest at the same
time throughout most of the stuff I've read so far (including his
"Seizing the Enigma").

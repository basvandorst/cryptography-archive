Wotta dickhead.  The key escrow was also "NSA-certified secure,"
wasn't it?  Yes, one "may" have a secure system now (I see you put a
back door in your post for future deniability--pretty clever), but if
you're dumb enough to trust this hunk of junk system after seeing
their ultra-foolproof escrow mechanism casually broken by a Bell Labs
scientist working alone, why don't you just use rot13 to protect your
sensitive data?

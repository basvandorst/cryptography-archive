Mathematical equations usually don't know the date, or even the time
of day, but the described safeguard is possible and might improve the
Skipjack process, yet not enough to prevent abuse.

As long as the algorithm remains classified, reasonable people should
oppose Skipjack on the grounds that a truly strong encryption
algorithm need not be classified.  Any action by an agency to protect
an encryption algorithm from scrutiny is a strong showing of no
confidence in that algorithm by the agency.

The biggest weakness in the current proposal exists at the point of
manufacture (key programming).  Another very big weakness exists with
the radiotelephony chip proposal, where the protocol initiation
exposes several layers of the lock to attack.  The biggest
philosophical problem had been that only two agencies of the Federal
Executive branch would hold they keys, but I have read that Al Gore
has taken the initiative to establish one of the escrow agencies
with the Courts.

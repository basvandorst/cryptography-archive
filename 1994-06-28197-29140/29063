Hi,
a friend of mine has put some effort into coding modular arithmetic routines.
Currently the construction of a chinese remainder signature for 512 bit takes
55 milli-seconds ( 18 per second ) on a standard i486 DX2 66.
Does anyone know how this speed relates to other implementations?
It would be nice to run this on a DX4 100 or so which has a faster multiply. We think
it will be around 3 to 4 times faster.

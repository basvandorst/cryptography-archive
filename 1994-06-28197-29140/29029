Boy am I waiting for the answer to this one!

I read somewhere that both plaintext and ciphertext are archived in the
case of State Dept files, but this is real old stuff.  Neither key nor
crypto-system are saved, and the plaintext is a paraphrase to avoid
providing a crib.

My source is Weber's (sp?) book on American Diplomatic Codes and Ciphers.

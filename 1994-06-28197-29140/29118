The current issue of `Communications Week International' informs us that the
European Union's Senior Officials Group for Security of Information Systems
has been considering plans for standardising key escrow in Europe.

Agreement had been held up by arguments over who should hold the keys. France 
and Holland wanted to follow the NSA's lead and have national governments
assume this role; other players wanted user organisations to do this.

According to the article (`Euro-Encryption Fears Grow', pp 1 and 38), the new
European crypto policy should have been decided by now. I wonder when it will
be made public?

     The networks of Belgian housewives run by Sigismund Payne Best
     during World War I used knitting patterns as a way to record the
     movement of German military trains.  They used plain stitches for
     troop wagons and purl for equipment wagons if I remember correctly.
     
     I heard this, apparently from Best's memoirs, on a radio programme
     presented by Christopher Andrew.  There may be more detail in
     Andrew's book "Her Majesty's Secret Service."

I don't see why not; that's what we have now, after all, with computers
that come with no hardware good enough to foil even a casual
eavesdropper.

I would hope neither Canada nor any province would be so arrogant as to
tell people they're not allowed to communicate insecurely!  I might be
in favor of action preventing the advertising of such a thing as real
security on "misleading advertising" grounds, but that's about as far
as I'd go.

No, if I ever find myself having to use a Clipper-"protected" channel,
I will simply treat it as if it were entirely unencrypted, meaning
that, for example, if I wanted to send something secret over it, I'd
encrypt it myself (with a cryptosystem I trust) first.

rather than a written signature.

FIPS 185, "Escrowed Encryption Standard (EES)", specifies a voluntary
technology available for protecting telephone communications (e.g.,
voice, fax, modem).

FIPS 180, "Secure Hash Standard (SHS)", specifies a Secure Hash
Algorithm
(SHA) for use with the Digital Signature Standard.  Additionally, for
applications not requiring a digital signature, the SHA is to be used
whenever a secure hash algorithm is required for federal
applications.

FIPS 46-2, "Data Encryption Standard (DES)", provides the technical
specifications for the DES.

FIPS 113, "Computer Data Authentication", specifies a Data
Authentication
Algorithm, based upon the DES, which may be used to detect
unauthorized
modifications to data, both intentional and accidental.  The Message
Authentication Code as specified in ANSI X9.9 is computed in the same
manner as the Data Authentication Code as specified in this standard.

FIPS 140-1, "Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules",
establishes the physical and logical security requirements for the
design and manufacture of modules implementing NIST- approved
cryptographic algorithms.

NIST Special Publication 800-2, "Public Key Cryptography", by James
Nechvatal, presents a survey of the state-of-the-art of public key
cryptography circa 1988-1990.

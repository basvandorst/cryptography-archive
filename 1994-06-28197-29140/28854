Somewhere, sometime I read a posting (in this group?) saying that there is now
an NSA museum, somewhere on the outskirts of Washington DC (I know, I know, it
sounds unlikely, doesn't it?). Can anyone shed any light on this? I'll be in
Washington next weekend, and if this mythical beast exists I'd be interested to
go visit.

Thanks in advance for any pointers anyone can give ...

There was an apocryphal short (1 paragraph) storay about World War II in
Washington, DC where someone found a piece of paper on a bus, inscribed
with text like K 3 P 2 ...  Supposedly it was turned in to the FBI as
a possible spy document, and agents studied it for some time before
someone recognized it as knitting instructions.

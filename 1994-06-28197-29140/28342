   The sense in which it is the "same" as simple substitution is that
you need 25 correct "guesses" to solve it, and each correct guess
reveals more plaintext.  Also for each unknown position in the
ciphertext, the plaintext possibilities are limited by the already
known wiring.  It is not quite a simple substitution problem--in
particular frequency counts don't help, but since the crib gave you
half a dozen pairings to start with, the difficulty is about the same.

   If however there were two steckerboards, one on the input, one on
the lamps, the problem would be much more difficult.

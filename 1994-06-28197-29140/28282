It is actually quite simple. The stepping mechanism consists of a
horizontal bar fitted with three stepping levers. The levers are
spring loaded and will only engage the ratched wheel on each rotor
if there is a notch on that rotor's right hand neighbour that is
lined up with the stepping lever. As the right most rotor has no
right hand neighbour it will step on every key press. This means
that all rotors will turn over synchronously when the conditions
are right.  Is this clear?

Breaking MD5 would not help them, in any way I can think of.  If you can
break MD5, that means you can generate a message with a given message
digest, or at least two messages with the same message digest.

But to get someone's secret key given his secret keyring, what you actually
need is the IDEA key used to encrypt the secret key, which is the MD5
of the passphrase.  If you know the IDEA key, and you can break MD5, then
you can come up with a passphrase that hashes to that IDEA key, but so
what?  You've already got what you want, namely the IDEA key, so what
do you need the passphrase for?

If his passphrase had been vulnerable to a dictionary attack, then they
could have gotten him--but the strength of MD5 is entirely irrelevant
as far as I can tell.

Did the NSA know about the possibilities of public/private key
encryption before Diffie's discovery of it yet kept their 
knowledge of such technology secret?

Did they know (if yes to the above) about a practical implementation
of the theory before the RSA algorythm was discovered?

I've wondered about this for years.

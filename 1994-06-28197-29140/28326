Alan MacDonald asks for references on quantum computing and such.

A good "initial reference (not a popularisation)" is "Algorithms
for Quantum Computation: Discrete Log and Factoring," Peter W. Shor,
AT&T Bell Labs.  I got a copy directly from Dr. Shor, but I believe
the paper is published in one of the recent IEEE security conferences.

The paper has descriptions of the algorithms of the title, a bit of
material about the implications of doing this with a "quantum computer,"
and a reference list that should support your desire to learn.

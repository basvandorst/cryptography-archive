Could anyone please clarify the 'LEAF hole' in Clipper?  My
understanding is that if one knows the technique, one can use
Clipper-equipped equipment to create a channel which is secure, and
which cannot be intercepted even with access to the escrowed keys.
Is this correct?  If so, Clipper sales should briskly increase one
of these days...

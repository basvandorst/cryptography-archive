  I suspect these numbers are in violent agreement...  If David is
talking about a 3-rotor machine, then the 4-rotor machines would take
about 26 times as long: 390 minutes or 6 and a half hours.  The 15360
rotor orders reference puzzles me, anyone know where it came from?  If
it is the sum of all the possible rotor orders for all possible
machines, there are lots of duplications.  But if David's number is
for three rotor machines only, then there would be many fewer
possibilities.

  Huts, mon, huts.  (Although I guess the machines in Washington were
housed in buildings.)

   Someone mentioned the invertability issue.  Certainly, for
commercial use having encryption and decryption symmetric was a
selling feature.  But in heirarchically organized military nets, there
would be a huge gain in security from having one set of rotors for
encryption and another for decryption.  Maybe the cost of duplicate
machines (or the addition of a 52-throw switch) was judged too costly.
I suspect that it was never considered.

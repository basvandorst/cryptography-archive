It is indeed suprising in this time and age for someone to pick
a 16 bit checksum for a cryptosystem. And why would you not have
a real big checksum for something like a LEAF, thats not a big
load on the bandwidth !

With all these CD-ROMs capable of holding a ton of a lookup table, .
... also did not Phil Karn have a Crypto-89 or Crypto-90 paper reviewing
Unix password one-way function security in the context such humoungous
look-up tables ?

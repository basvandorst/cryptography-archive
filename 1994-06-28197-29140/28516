I appreciate what Jim Thomas has to say about the Seabrook piece.
Perhaps we need to spread the idea that a person should lurk for
a while (at least two-three months) before jumping in.  Of 
course, that is out of the question for a reporter who is given
an assignement to write about a strange place they have never
visited next week.  Perhaps an analogy of a usenet news group
being like a club would help.  Net sociology is not all*that*
different.  Keith Henson

I believe VLSI has always used their own 1u fabs for all ViaLink
products. Cypress can also fab ViaLinks in their .65u process.

ViaLinks were developed by QuickLogic for their FPGA devices. VLSI can
use the technology as part of their foundry agreement with QL.
QuickLogic is now using Cypress as a foundry for their new generation
of products.

For more info on ViaLinks see

    silicon antifuse", Kathryn Gordon and Richard Wong, IEDM 1993

    "Reliability mechanism of the unprogrammed amorphous silicon
    antifuse", Richard Wong and Kathryn Gordon, IRPS 1994

The first paper has some nice SEM cross-sections of programmed
antifuses.

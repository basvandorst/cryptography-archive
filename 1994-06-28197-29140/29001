     I am looking for a 16 bit implementation of crypt.  Something like
fcrypt, libdes or ufc-crypt.  I am looking to hack up a version of crack
on a massively parallel SIMD machine.  The problem is that the machine
only has support for signed 32 bit ints.  So, I was wondering if anyone
knows where I can find a 16 bit or signed 32 bit version of crypt, or a
patch to fcrypt, libdes or ufc-crypt?

               Many thanks,

               Clem Taylor

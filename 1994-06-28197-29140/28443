The problem is that the goverment has far to much crypto experiance
for this to be a simple mistake. Suppose this "flaw" was deliberate?
You spend Billions implementing Clipper and suddenly "discover" that
it fails to meet one of its prime design objectives. What will they
do now?

The answer is simple. The only way they figure out who is cheating 
the system is to try and decode everybodys conversations and make
a list of those that they cannot break.

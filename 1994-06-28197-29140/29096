True it need not but the fact is *we do not know* and I always assume worst 
case (legacy from designing digital flight controls for aircraft). In this
instance IMHO "worst case" does not matter since we still have 2^64 possible 
keys - not as good as 2^80 but better than DES. However, barring any further
revelation, this is all that we can count on and *that* was my point.

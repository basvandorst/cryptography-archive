In that case what has been observed is a `feature' rather than
a flaw. Assuming this, can anyone tell me the reason why this
feauture was never mentioned by the maker of Clipper?

For example, if I buy a Honda car, I would like to know what
features it comes with. It is unfair to the customer/user who
discovers later his Honda can also fly, if a button in some
corner is pressed.

I suppose one can also claim that certain features in an advanced
product may not be easy to explain to an ordinary customer. Thus,
they decided not to tell. What about the designers and engineers who
are charged by their companies in putting Clipper in their products? 
Are they also stupid to understand this feature? I guess not, since 
one of them seems to have discovered it on his own.

 [What appears to be the non-rotten decrypted text]

Archille, you are doing this all wrong! You should have held out for a
big cash reward *before* given out the secret! Now you have no bargaining
power. Anyway, how did you crack it so quickly? I figured it is a simple
alphabet substition, so I quickly wrote a program to try all possible
substitions, but it looks like it will take quite a while. Did you write
a really fast program? Or did you just ran it on a Cray or something?


And now for something totally different
=======================================

I have a question for the net. Assuming someone did come up with a
serious encryption system, and published the algorithm, program, etc,
and asked for comments. What would be a suitable prize to get some
people working on it? Would it make a difference if the algorithm was
released into the public domain (like nCrypt recently) or not?

Would $100 get you excited to work on it?
Would $1K get you to spend a week hacking?
How about $10K?
Would you never spend any real time on something so stupid?

I guess I might as well turn this into a survey. Please email me and
I will summarise for the net.

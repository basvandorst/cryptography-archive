Better idea: write a "delete" program which writes random junk over the
file before it deletes it.  One can very well argue that the writing of
random junk is to prevent the files from being undeleted [even by
someone with a high end analog disk analyser]; such programs are in fact
in use now, and there's nothing seen as suspicious about them.

I agree that the work breaking the Enigma was not trivial, but the
large number of possibilities quoted above is irrelevant -- solving
the plugboard wiring is still a "simple substitution" cipher, prone
to statistical and pragmatic attacks known for centuries.  A
monoalphabetic cipher with random mixed alphabets has more possible
keys than the plugboard offers, but the attack on it is much better
than brute force.

As I believe W.F. Friedman noted, a comparitively weak cipher used
correctly is better than a strong cipher used poorly.  And the
Germans made many blunders in their use of Enigma.

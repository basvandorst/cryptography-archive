I've also once tried studying this topic, last year.  From what I
remember, (and what I figured out), in v1.1 there are 16 bits of data/info
to tell you whether you have entered a correct password (of course "false
hits" is always possible even in this case).  In v2 this reduces to 8.
So we are bound to get 256 times more false hits than before, I think.

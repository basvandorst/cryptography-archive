You are confusing "incompatible" with "interoperable".

That PGP 2.6 is compatible is shown by the minor changes needed to allow
other forms of PGP to interoperate with it.

In contrast, nothing one can do to other forms of PGP will allow longer keys
to interoperate with it until IT is changed.

Thus the writer who complained about ui was correct, and your attempted
refutation of his point incorrect.

What's more, like it or not, PGP 2.6 and its MIT successors, being "street
legal" in the U.S., are going to be the de facto standards both here and
elsewhere, and those who have been screaming about interoperability all
these months should do nothing to alter that capability. MIT cannot and will
not change certain aspects of PGP, being bound by U.S. patents and
copyrights which they accept. Thus it is now for those outside the U.S., not
so bound, to adapt to 2.6 and its successors. You don't have to like it, but
you do have to do it to be both interoperable and consistent with all the
ranting about interoperability in the past, now that the show is on the
other foot.

their pals that they are right in the middle of the road. Nothing is wrong
any more (except, of course, conservative thoughts and expressions).

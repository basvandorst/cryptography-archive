   Could you expand on this?  Both the vulnerabliity and what message
   padding is?

The vulnerability is in the multiplicativity of RSA.  In pure RSA, you
take a message and encrypt it in an RSA key (public or private, it
really doesn't matter, but let's use private key just for an example,
without loss of generality).

So, you sign a message, M1, with your private key, so you have C1 =
M1^d mod N.  Now you sign another message, M2, and you have C2 = M2^d
mod N.  If I know M1 and M2, then I, as an attacker, can now create M3
== M1*M2, and I already have _your_ signature on this message, C3 =
M3^d mod N = C1 * C2!

PGP gets around this by padding the message inside the RSA encryption.
There are fixed bytes that get wrapped around the message, and ruin
the multiplicativity of RSA (e.g., if I always force the number to
begin with the 32-bit sequence 0x01020304).  

One thing this does do is reduce the search-space of the possible
messages that can be encrypted.  For example, if I had a 512-bit RSA
key, I now reduced my search space to, say, 400 bits, or 2^400
possibilities, which is still next to impossible to accomplish.

There is a lot more to it, but this is the basic idea.  I recommend
reading Bruce's book, which explains in a lot more detail and gives a
lot more information.  It is very well written.

Hope this helps

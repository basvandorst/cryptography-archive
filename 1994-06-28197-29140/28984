A friend of mine is working on a project to install "barcode" readers
on the toll bridges in the SF Bay area. The idea is that you drive through
the toll plaza at the speed of traffic, and your credit card is charged
for your months tolls.

The obvious implementation is open to "traffic" analysis. Could anyone
point me to a digital money type protocol that would preserve the anonymity
of the commuters? I would like to present it to her to forstall the
Big Brother effect of this technology.

Thanks in advance; please email to the below address.

James

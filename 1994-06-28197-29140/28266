Sorry, I should have been clearer that the step I described as "look at
the lights" was automated; as you say, a bell was rung. However, the
bombes didn't halt, they just disengaged the "carry" mechanism, so the
right hand rotors kept spinning until someone came to stop it, with the
others in the correct position.

Now this is nothing like the description I remember (which I think was
in "The Hut 6 Story"). That was basically as I described in my last
posting, plus a diagram showing how to do the wiring, and how the
diagonal board fitted in.

There's something odd going on here.

In addition to the bombes, I have read that cryptographers used
perforated sheets that they would stack, being able to determine the
rotors after about the first 10 sheets. There is an example of one
of these sheets in the book "The Enigma War."

	ps... is the enigma20.zip program floating around thru gopher-
space the enigma emulator? (pls forgive this small double post.. just
occurred to me that people might night see it in other enigma
rotor posting)......
	I must say that even knowing all the settings and positions
the sample message (that I posted from Cryptologia) is no cinch
to crack.... I dug thru my later copies today hoping to find the
solution and clarification of plugboard settings but to no avail.

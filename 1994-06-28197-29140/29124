This is a followup to an earlier post I wrote about getting DES to work
between a PC and a SUN.
Thank you all for the numerous replies. I believe we have worked out
the problems (although I still do not trust the code from my programmers,
but that is another story:-(  ).

One more thing that really had me stumped for a while was the fact that we
were using a certain key ("11111   ") and a certain data ("davedied") for
testing, while things were not working. At some point, the programmers tweaked
the code somehow, and got that to work. Except that ONLY that combination
of keys worked! Anything else did not match!
I would be VERY interested in HOW that could happen. I would think the chances
would be astronomical for us to have stumbled across the ONE combination
of key and data that happened to give us the same result on both machines, 
but nothing else would.

I'm not exactly sure what the programmers did, but we ran a test of 1000 random
8 character strings, and supposedly they came up with all the same encrypted
data I did on the SUN. Is that a valid test? I hope so..

Anyway.. thanks again for the help.

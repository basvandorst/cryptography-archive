The encrypted text contains even more information about the key. 
(in fact is uniquely dependent on the key and the pain text) but that
does not help ( we hope) in finding the key. So yes the check sum
contains information, but useless information.(assuming of course that
the checksum  is any good and not just the last 16 bits of the session key say)

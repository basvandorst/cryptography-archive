I'm working on developing a large integer math package for a Thinking Machines
CM-5.  I was planning on storing and operating on the numbers using a Chinese
Remainder Theorem (CRT) based representation.

Does anyone know of papers or books that talk about the current state of the
art in the CRT. I'm very interested in methods for overflow detection,
comparison and division. (Overflow and comparison seem to be equivalent
problems according to Knuth:Seminumerical Algorithms p.277)

thanks,

Mike

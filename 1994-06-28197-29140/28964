_Cryptologia_ is published by the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology
in Terre Haute, Indiana.  Call Long Distance Directory Assistance
at 1-(area code)-555-1212 to get Rose-Hulman's number, then phone
Rose-Hulman.  Ask them how you go about purchasing reprints or
back issues of Cryptologia.

I imagine the percentage of _Cryptologia_ articles "available on
the net" is roughly equal to the percentage of _Fine_Woodworking_
articles, or _Glass_Audio_ articles, or _Sky_and_Telescope_ articles,
or _Sport_Aviation_ articles "available on the net."  But this
is just a guess.

It is not the requirement to use the same session key that makes the
other device's LEAF a concern; it is the fact that each device will not
operate until it has been given a valid LEAF, so you need to feed each
device a spoofed LEAF.  The session key is negotiated separately and is
already known to the two devices before they exchange LEAF messages.

However, although Blaze's preprint states a rogue device can operate
with a compliant device, it does not address the issue of the compliant
device sending the valid LEAF.  You don't need the other devices
cooperation necessarily, but it does seem you need to suppress its valid
LEAF somehow.  E.g., if you could reliably jam the communications
channel briefly, that would be sufficient.  But that would be awkward in
almost any application.

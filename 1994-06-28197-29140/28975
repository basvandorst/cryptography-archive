Fair enough.  However....

MIT is wrong in this instance.  VIACrypt's PGP 2.5 is legal in the US, and
MIT-PGP 2.6 is not interoperable with it.  (I agree with some of the other
posters that it should, at least, have been named 2A.6, if not 3.0.)

And if source code to 2.6 is not released (within the US), the
source-code-available versions will almost certainly become the standard
outside the US, even if they (may) be illegal (to use) in the US.

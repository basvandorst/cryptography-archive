The museum is only open weekdays.  It is near the intersection of
Maryland Route
32 and the Baltimore-Washington Parkway.  Exit the parkway onto 32 east
and follow
the signs.  Left toward the Shell station and along a narrow road that
leads
to what was the Colony 7 Motel.  It is small, but interesting.  Someone
else
will correct me if I am wrong about the weekdays thing.

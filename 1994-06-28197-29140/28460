I partially agree, and I indicated that the article was generally
harmless. If it were a single thread in the mosaic of media
images depicting the net, it would pass as a benign human interest
story. Unfortunately, Seabrook's article typifies much of the
mainstream media's coverage of the net (see especially the
Newsweek coverage in the past few months). In the aggregate, such
pieces falsify issues, misrepresent facts, and subvert attempts to
generate dialogue.
 
In some ways, the Seabrook piece was of interest in describing the
emotional impact of a rather nasty flame on a newbie. One value
of Seabrooks's piece is that he presented a slice of the Net as
he experienced it, which is useful. If the article focused on that
issue, rather than attempted to move beyond and speak to other
issues, it would have had more merit. For some of us, what's at
stake isn't Seabrook qua Seabrook, but rather how the media continue
to play follow-the-leader in hopping onto a cyberstory and finding
the lowest common discursive and intellectual denominator to 
pursue.

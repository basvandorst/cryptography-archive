well, i was curious about what mr. gardner is talking about here,
since he didn't trouble to be really clear about it. now, i agree
that he guessed wrong in supposing that the rhind papyrus is a
cryptographic or number-theoretic matter. but, in his defense,
the problem he's talking about is an algorithms problem, and does
seem to be an old and open one, at least according to richard
gilling's "mathematics in the time of the pharaohs," (dover paperback).

what's at issue here is that the egyptian scribes used unit fractions
almost exclusively in their maddeningly exact calculations, and so
had to reduce fractions like p/q to sums of unit fractions. they did
this by table-lookup, but no one has discovered the algoirithm or
criteria they used to build the tables.

the 2/n table mr. gardner refers to is the topic of some controversy
in the history of egyptian arithmetic, and gillings' book devotes a
chapter to it. the table is called the recto of the rhind mathematical
papyrus. the recto lists unit fraction expansions, in 4 terms or less,
of the numbers 2/n, for n = 5, 7,..., 101 . it's apparently widely
suspected in the r.m.p. literature that these expansions are optimal
in some sense, but the egyptian scribes aren't telling.

looking over gillings' presentation of the recto, i see that
mr. gardner's observation does generate 46 of the 49 entries.
in all but one of the expansions of 2/n having 3 or 4 terms:

	2/n = 1/A + 1/B + 1/C (+ 1/D),

we do find A = LCM( B, C, (D)), as mr. gardner says. the remaining,
2-term expansions, with 2 exceptions, also support mr. gardner:
n does divide B, and A is rich in factors. for the curious among
those who are still reading, the exceptions are:

	2/101 = 1/101 + 1/202 + 1/303 + 1/606;

	2/35 = 1/30 + 1/42; 2/91 = 1/70 + 1/130.

gillings compares the recto to a computer-generated table of all possible
short expansions, and seems to conclude that the recto is the product of
a millenium of trial and error. gardner's analysis persuades me, but i'm
not a pro, so i don't know whether his idea is new; someone may have done
this since '72, when gillings wrote. even if it's not new, i credit mr.
gardner with acuity.

I've supported DS's right to speak in the past.  His last message, however,
was almost 150 lines of irrelevant blather on a subject not remotely related
to crypto.  

Why do we let him do this?

Davey, either focus on the newsgroup topic, or create alt.DS.defense, and
pollute that.  I'd like to learn about & discuss CRYPTOGRAPHY.  Okay?

And for everyone else, it should be your/our job to keep Mr. Wind on the 
topic.  ( Which I am convinced he would tire of and move on. )

I don't believe for a second that this will actually happen, because he is
far too skilled at tweaking people, and there are too many who allow them-
selves to be tweaked.   ...So I'll killfile anything with a "Sternlight" in
it.  Anywhere.

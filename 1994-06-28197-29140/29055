Hello all. I am a newcomer in cryptography and a new user of PGP. This what
I am asking now might be very old question, stupid, or contained in the Faq
but I have to ask this anyway. 

 I have been wondering about these different versions of PGP. 2.6 and 2.3.
2.6 used mainly in USA and 2.3 in other countries. Why this? Are 2.3 and 2.6
compatible, why 2.3 can be spreaded around but 2.6 not? What's the
difference and WHY IN THE HELL ARE PEOPLE USING DIFFERENT VERSIONS, if they
are not compatible? 

 Don't flame me being stupid, I just don't know.

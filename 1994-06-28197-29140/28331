I mis-interpreted the question, thinking it meant something like A & B
mapping to C. I agree with what you say, but I think what would happen in
actuality is one of the lights will light up, and then when the other key
is pressed, the light will go out. I do not think it is possible to press
both keys simultaneously so that neither lights up. But I never tried this
either.

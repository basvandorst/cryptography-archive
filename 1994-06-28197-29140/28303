Well, Matt Blaze has discovered that it turns out that one can just
exhaustively generate LEAFs until one finds valid ones -- one in in
2^16 will work. All you do then is pass a forged LEAF to the other

Encryption, but defeat the escrow. (There are some subtleties with
initialization vectors, but they turn out not to matter.)

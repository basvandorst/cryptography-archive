It occurred to me that I didn't phrase this awfully well--the ultimate
density of the index 2, or any other index, could well be zero.  What
I really want to know is the frequency of small indices for values
of k in the 75 to 150-decimal-digit range used by PGP.

Or, more generally, if f_i (n) is the number of k's less than n
with index equal to i, what is the asymptotic form of f_i (n) as
n goes to infinity?

A silly question.  If someone reverse-engineers Skipjack and publishes it, 
wouldn't that be considered prior art?  After all, nothing has been published
detailing Skipjack, and if someone reverse-engineered it and went to press 
(or managed to develop the algorithm independently), their work may well be
the first written on the subject.


I've always thought that one of the fundamental premises behind patents is that
the government protects the invventor from competition for a time (17 years),
in exchange, the inventor makes the details of his invention public.  Thus,
any patent held in secret is invalid.


Of course, I know that in reality the law regarding this is whatever the Feds
say it is.... but this does seem to me an abuse of patent law.  :(

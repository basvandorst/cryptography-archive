This quote is from the highly visible supporter of the Clipper chip. It's HIS
living room, HE gets to choose who HE lets in...the rest of us get Clipper.
What a hypocrit!!

Here we have the biggest polluter (IMO and most others) of Usenet telling
the REST of us not to pollute. Once again "Do as I say, not as I do"
I pledge to keep the FYI--proClipper squad, who is DS--articles flowing
as long as DS keeps spewing his disinformation. DS, if you really want to
clean up Usenet, start with yourself. After all, you are the cause of
most of the brushfires that keep popping up. 

But wait, the propaganda continues...

Thank you DS, for the fine example of Orwellian Newspeak!! In 1994 Amerika,
"education" means "indoctrination--to teach to accept a system of thought
uncritically" and "policy discussion" means "policy decision." Of course,
these definitions are only valid if the statement by DS is taken to be
true. If you would rather believe a lie, use the non-Newspeak
definitions.
It should be obvious to even the most casual observer that when DS speaks
of "service to his country" he is not talking about the Constitutional
Republic of America. Based on his background, and his rhetoric, what he
really means by "service to his country" is "service to the New World
Order--the one-government global-state." If you are so proud of your
service, DS, why don't you just come out of the dark, and say what you
REALLY mean? Tell us that one-world government cannot be achieved without
a surveillance capabilty and the ability to control the masses. If you are
so confident that this "New World Order" is the best for all, why are you
so reluctant to justify your stance on the Clipper chip? At least President
Bush was honest about his goal of a "New World Order." 
Of course, you and I both know that tyranny by force is not a long term 
solution. The long term solution is tyranny by consent. Isn't that right, DS?
The long term solution (to achieve the global-state) is to convince the 
masses that the Clipper chip (or FBI Telephony Bill, war with Korea, etc.) 
is in *their* best interest. Then the masses not only consent, 
they *demand* that the respective policy be enacted. A recent example that 
comes to mind was the debate over more gun control. All of the major media
were pummelling the public with news stories and shows about the "current
crime crisis" and the panacea of gun control. In all of that coverage,
I wonder why there was no mention of the fact that Clinton has yet to 
appoint Federal judges to fill the numerous positions that are still vacant?
I am sure we can expect some Clintonesque response from DS that is neither 
a denial nor a confirmation, but is a quick dodge to another subject. 
Please, oh Illuminous One, enlighten the rest of us.

P.S. My contribution today is to put the rhetoric of DS in perspective.

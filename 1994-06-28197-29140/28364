Becasue it's not in any FAQ.  I just added this so that people wouldn't
be tempted to tell me to go elsewhere or post responses with no 
substance aimed at telling me what to do rather than answering the
question.  Your idea is good.  Unfortunately, I'm not a programmer.  I
was just hoping to interest someone out here in writing something
that seems not so difficult, transparent to the user and possibly
secure all point to point data communications (within the limits
of public key encryption speeds) from eavesdroppers.  People have
e-mailed me telling me that it's difficult to capture ('tap')
data sent by modem.  These people obviously havn't tried ATC0, then
ATD or ATA (depending on which side you want to see) on an 'extension'
phone.

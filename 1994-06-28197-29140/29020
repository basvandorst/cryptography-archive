   The way the LEAF checksum is shown in Blaze's paper, it seems likely
to me that the checksum might be something like
 
   Low16Bits(Encrypt(ConstantString XOR IV,SessionKey))
 
   In this case, the 16 bit checksum doesn't make a keysearch attack
significantly faster, as several people on sci.crypt pointed out.  As
I said before, if NSA wanted to design the LEAF checksum to leak key
bits, they could easily do so.  If not, then it probably doesn't leak.

Most implementations of the RSA public-key cryptosystem, for example
PGP, test for primality of a number k by checking to see if
a^[(k-1)/2] = J(a|k) mod k  where J is the (generalized?) Jacobi
symbol and a is some number relatively prime to k; if the equation
is true then (I think) k is said to be a strong pseudoprime to base a.

The set of all bases a to which k is strongly pseudoprime is a
subgroup of the multiplicative group (Z/kZ)*, and if k is not
prime then it is a proper subgroup, so for a randomly-chosen a,
the probability is at most 1/2 that k is strong pseudoprime wrt a.

My question is, what is the distribution of values [(Z/kZ)* : G]
(where G is the subgroup of bases making k strong pseudoprime)?
My guess is that the value 2 is very rare indeed--but how rare,
and how rare that the index is less than, say, 100?  Bob Silverman?

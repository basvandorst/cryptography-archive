i know that this has nothing to do with sci.crypt, but, i don't know
what group would be more approriate, and this is the one news group that i
always read, so, flames accepted with a smile. (-:

i am looking for a book that has just been published in the UK and is not available in the states.  will someone in the UK please email me the name
and telephone number of a book seller that might be able to help me?

The book is: The Man in the Ice.
Publisher:   Weidenfeld & Nicholson (London)

the English translation was published early this year.

many thanks,

cheers,

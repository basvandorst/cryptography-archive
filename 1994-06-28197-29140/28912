I just read the Bruce Sterling speech to CFP in the July Wired.  My question:  
Who cares if the spookazis put clipper everywhere.  We can just use our s/w 
driven DSPs to put our own encryption on top of that.  

Are they going to make using any encryption but their own illegal?  How would 
they enforce that.   Noise in a picture or piece of music you share with your 
buds is just that (unless you know the code).

Welcome to a world of secure communications, whether you like it or not.

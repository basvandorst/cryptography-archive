Man! I'm jealous. David has already been mentioned in _Wired_ (issue
1.5 refers to alt.fan.david-sternlight), he was mentioned by the NSA
Counsel at CFP '93, and now the _New Yorker_ complements him
(pseudonymously and perhaps erroneously, which I think is *way* cool).

Well, I can only cross my fingers and I hope that my plan to be
mentioned in _Wired_ comes fruition in the next issue.

To search, _Wired_ for *your* name, try:
   gopher gopher.wired.com
and select "Text Search <?>"

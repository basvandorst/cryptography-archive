Two examples from Norway:

One bank use a challenge-response system based on a crypto calculator
for customer authentication. I believe it's DES-based, but I wouldn't
know for sure. Don't know the length of the challenge and response
words. I believe the calculator is protected by a PIN.

Another bank use a simple paper-based challenge-response authentication.
(Bank issues challenge by naming a position on a grid, customer gives
 the PIN printed in that position.) I've got no information about the
management system used for issuing the PIN grids to customers.

A number of banks use a PIN to authenticate customers using an
automatic credit balance enqiry system.

Any discussions about the merits of these systems should probably
be carried out in a "security" newsgroup rather than sci.crypt.

    A basic flaw has been found in the Clipper-chip technology
Washington is promoting as a way to let authorities
eavesdrop on scrambled telephone and computer conversations,
The New York Times reported in its 2 June editions.
     Someone with enough computer skills can defeat the
government's technology by using it to encode messages so that
not even the government can crack them, according to Matthew
Blaze, a researcher at AT&T Bell Laboratories.
    The Clipper chip has been widely criticized by
commmunications executives and privacy rights advocates,
who fear its ``Big Brother'' potential.
     Blaze said the flaw would not allow a third party to break
an encrypted computer conversation, but would let two people
have a conversation that law enforcement officials could
not unscramble.
      ``People who want to work around Clipper will be able to
do it,'' said Martin Hellman, a Stanford University cryptologist,
who has read a paper circulated by Blaze.

Hi, I have been reading the stuff here about the attack on the small 
LEAF authentication field, and would like to point out that using 
clipper with a forged LEAF does not lead to security at all, as it is 
still possible to try out every key that has ever been generated for a 
clipper device, looking for the right one this way.  It will probably 
take a couple of min. insead of milliseconds, but be just as sure.

The only reason I am adding this is becuse I saw this said at some 
point earlier and did not see it corrected.  You might argue "but they 
would never let them use the whole database" but a good counter 
argument to that would be "national security:-("

I think that they only checked out the NSA's tests of the algorithm.
Most of the report that I read dealt with a few statistical tests.

In their defense, I would say that this isn't a security problem--
it is a security feature. (:-)) By any measure of the word 
"invulnerable", Clipper is more so.

This is why the hardware nature of Clipper is the _true_ flaw. 
If this was already widespread, then it would cost millions
if not billions of dollars to fix.

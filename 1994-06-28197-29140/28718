I was wondering about something I heard on the internet concerning a child
pornographer and pgp. The article said he had used pgp to encrypt his 
files, I assume pictures and contacts. The police were at a loss to 
access these files, but they had his secret key. I assume they did 
because they had access to his computer. Now if they can not access his 
files this means that they could not break his passwd phrase right. The 
question is how strong is the hash, or MD5. Shouldn't they be able to break
the passwd and get his files? What are the odds for and against?

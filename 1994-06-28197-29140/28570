I will send this reply as a follow-up article as I understand you
have some problems with UUCP, and a clarification of the Enigma
rotor turnover might have a general interest. 

I used the expression "double advancement anomoly" which perhaps is
not a very good description of what is actually happening. Using the
word "double" I ment to say that the middle rotor moves ONE step
forward together with the third rotor, the middle rotor will not step
twice, for a single key press. The key to the understanding of this
mechanism is that the middle rotor can step forward together with the
third rotor regardless of the position of the rightmost, fast rotor
which usually governs the stepping of the middle rotor.

To illustrate this let us look at a few examples. Let us use Rotor I
in the rightmost position (fast rotor) and Rotor II in the middle
position. We can place any other rotor in the third position. Rotor I
will allow stepping of its lefthand neighbour when Q appears in the
window and likewise for Rotor II when E appears in the window.

It is clear that if we have the following rotor positions:
			A E Q
all of the rotors will step forward on positon on the next key
press as both the notch on the rightmost rotor and the middle
rotor is in the engaged position. The result will be:
			B F R

If on the other hand we started with the situation:
			A D Q
a normal turnover of the middle rotor will take place as the
rightmost rotor has its notch in the engaged position. The
result will be:
			A E R
On the next key press the righthand rotor will step forward one
position as usual and the third rotor (leftmost rotor) will also
step forward one position as the middle rotor has its notch in 
the engaged position, but due to the anomoly the middle rotor
will step as well, even if it stepped forward on position on the
last key press. The end result will be:
			B F S

This is what I meant by the double stepping of the middle rotor.
It is clear that this will shorten the period of the machine as
the middle rotor will step forward twice without a complete 
revolution of the fast, rightmost rotor.

I hope the Enigma stepping mechanism now has become somewhat clearer.

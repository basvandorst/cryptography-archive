Oh no!  Am I in davids kill file?  Wow, this guy really is an assholek, isn't
he?

Does he always choose to respond mainly in a hostile fashon to anyone who 
questions what he says?  Does he always respond to these questions by 
ignoring them, and continuing to spout stuff in his own and the CFR's best 
interest?  Gee, before this thread, I thought that people who spouted 
conspiricy theories about the CFR and the trilatleralists wher parrionoids 
who needed a good dose of reality.  After seeing this behavior, I am quite 
curious as to what exactly is going on here, and would like to investigate 
this further.  Perhaps the work of people like dave could be responsible 
for much of the grief that the US causes for other countries.  Great work, 
Dave.  Sorry if I am too arogent for you.  Oh, but you can't read this, so 
it dosn't matter.

Roger.

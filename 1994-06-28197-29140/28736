From my reading of the NIST announcements and backgound
documents, I do not believe that NIST is debating
"the resonableness of algorithm patents".

I believe that there scope is much more technically limited to
the enforcability and validity questions of the Hellman (et al)
patents, which Jim Bidzos (Head of PKP) himself stated in 1987 were
not
enforcable in terms of RSA Digital Signatures.

And the prior art and applicability question of the Schnorr patent
to the NSA DSS equations and now patent.

The g++ library has a RNG class that the manual describes as follows:

   Class ACG is a variant of a Linear Congruential Generator
   (Algorithm M) described in Knuth, _Art of Computer Programming_,
   Vol III.  This result is permuted with a Fibonacci Additive
   Congruential Generator to get good independence between samples.

Does anyone know how good this is?

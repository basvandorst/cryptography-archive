Very interesting. I am now even more satisfied that concealing the inputs
and outputs of the hash functions is a good approach. The question of
whether my Stop & Go implementation is secure remains open...

---- Virtual Press Release ----

CustomWare of Toronto has released a shareware Newton application called
"nCrypt". nCrypt provides "strong" encryption for Newton objects including
notes and names.

This version of nCrypt provides password protection for Newton objects and
is intended for use as a personal privacy utility. nCrypt directly encrypts
notes, names, and many other Newton objects. In addition to encrypting
text, nCrypt can directly encrypt objects, thus it can capture styles,
drawings, and other information.

A commercial version to follow will also implement "public key" protocols
for digital signature authentication and key distribution similar to
PowerTalk, RIPEM/SIG, PGP and RIPEM.

nCrypt also suppports "drop in" encryption modules for adding compatibility
with other encryption systems. Interested developers may contact CustomWare
about writing encryption modules or for testing their apps with nCrypt for
compatibility. The algorithms used by nCrypt will be made available in a
technical note for review.

NOTE: To comply with ITAR regulations, nCrypt is not for distribution
outside of Canada/USA. The shareware version limits keys to 40 bits of
effective keylength. Registered users receive an unlimited version, which
provides 160 bits of effective keylength. Registration is $25; users may
register by snailmail or on Compuserve via GO SWREG.

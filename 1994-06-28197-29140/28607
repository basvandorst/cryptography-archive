This is only dangerous only if there are people in the world who
might want to subvert such a simple system ;)  BTW: one of the ironclad
rules in banking is never disclose when your systems were subverted.

How much of this is going on???  Not enough in $$(money) loss to pay for
encrypted systems is the probable answer.  (That, or the customer has to
pay for these losses ;)  (Encrypted systems are not cheap (see: ClipJob)
and if the NSA has anything to do with it, things will stay this way!)

I know of none.  But I do know of some banks that now encrypt between
their automatic teller machines and their network.  Hummmmm.... seems
some folks discovered you could access the bank's phone lines by opening a
box behind the bank.  

Then ... well, ... that's not disclosed :)  (But a hint:  How much money 
is in one of those machines?  Answer: usually about $125,000 when fully
stocked.)

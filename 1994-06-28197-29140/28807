Professor Knight from MIT posted a list of about 20
U.S. Patents that cover methods of achieving tamper-resistance
and reverse engineering resistance.  He put it in sci.crypt,
where some of the early discussion of Clipper took place.

I have heard**  that Mykotronix has backed away from earlier
claims about such resistance in the Clipper chips it is actually
selling today.  I have heard** that they'll sell you bare nekkid
die, ready for assembly in hybrids or MCMs.

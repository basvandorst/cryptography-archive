This isn't (at least in the USA).  Even it they had invented it and kept it
secret before the Diffie patent, once that patent issued they have no more
right than anyone else to use the invention without a license.  That is
alway the risk when a company decides to keep something as a trade secret
rather than patent it. If someone else can reverse-engineer their
product/process/whatever then they can apply for a patent, and if granted,
they can then force the first company to stop infringing on their patent! 
In this case, however, there is a mechanism (I don't recall all the
details) where the NSA could have applied for a patent but had the
application classifed secret for national security reasons.  Then, if
someone else published or submitted a patent application they would already
have their application on file with the patent office.  The fact that they
didn't do anything like this makes me think that Diffie beat them to the
invention.

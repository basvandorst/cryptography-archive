If the LEAF structure revealed to Matt Blaze (i.e. 32-bit unit ID, 80-bit
encrypted session key, 16-bit checksum) and reported first in his Feb msg
is the whole thing, and if you know how to produce the checksum, and if
you know the family key, and if you either know the "special" version of
Skipjack used to generate LEAFs or you know how to tickle the chip into
executing it for you, you should be able to produce a conforming LEAF
fast.  The actual details of growing a LEAF are classified, and referenced
in FIPS185 as "LCM-1" (LEAF Creation Method 1) with no details.

No, not that stupid.  If the (single) family key leaks and if the attacker
can tickle her chip into decrypting the LEAF, she can do traffic analysis
on unBlazed Tessera traffic, but still can't read the traffic.

If the government is telling the truth, it isn't be easier to break the
encrypted session key than the original message.  If they're not telling
the truth, they could be lying about the strength of the algorithm in the
first place, so you've got just as bad a problem.  No big deal.

TESSERA/CAPSTONE/CLIPPER: If it's not worth doing, it's not worth doing right.

In general, solution process for the 3-step cipher given by 
(simple substitution) (arbitrary cipher) (simple substitution)
does not reduce to that for simple substitution if the key to the 
arbitrary cipher in the middle is known.  I presume that Enigma is not
a special case where such a reduction does happen, because it
resembles too closely a puzzle system called Ragbaby, which does not
reduce. I have carried out known plaintext attacks on examples of
the Ragbaby, as have numerous other hobbyists.

The Ragbaby system is (simple substitution) (Vigenere with key
ABC...Z) (inverse of first simple substitution)
[with the presumably irrelevant exceptions that a 24 letter alphabet 
is used and the key starts over at
letter n at the beginning of the n-th word]. I may be wrong, but I
don't think that the self-inverse property or other details of
the steckerboard substitution cause the desired reduction, nor do
I think that the rotor steps in the middle are 'easy' in this
sense either.

In a sense, the fact that a plaintext-ciphertext letter pair
does not tell us the rotor input or output letters (equivalent
since we know the rotor keys) may be considered
'a complex effect on the rotors'.

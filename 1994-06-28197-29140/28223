Take it easy. They have shown that IN PRINCIPLE a quantum computer could do this.
Unfortunately no quantum computers exist, and making one would be very very hard, not least
because of the problem of coherence maintenance. So, once you hear about quantum computers
actually existing, then get worried. (Note it is highly doubtful that NSA is better at
quantum computers than the outside world. Quantum mechanics just is not the kind of thing
they would ever have thought of hiring the best people in the world for). I'd be a lot more
worried by better classical factoring algorithms.

[various rantings deleted]

Ok, then how about telling us how one obtains this document (i.e. the annual
report you mention).  If it does, in fact, support your claims then maybe
folks will do something about it.  If not, then I think these arguements 
should go back to alt.conspiricy where they belong.

While I, too, oppose clipper, et al in any form for a variety of reasons,
it's a bit of a leap to go to a "government plot" without some pretty
tangible evidence.

later,

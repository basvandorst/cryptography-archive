   The Blaze security hole starts to look deeper.  Use Tessera cards
to generate and collect lots of real LEAFs.  For each LEAF keep its
entire providence.  (The IV, session key, chip ID, etc.)  Sort them
into families which pass the checksum test.  (Be the first to collect
the whole set. ;-) Now test candidate LEAF1 algorithms against the
families...  If the algorithm IS relatively simple, you will identify
it, and provide a stringent test for its authenticity.

   Ooops!

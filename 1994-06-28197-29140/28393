Bruce Schneier's "Applied Cryptography," 1993, is about the best book
I know of. Much better, because of code examples and wide range of
topics, than the older textbooks (Denning, Patterson, Brassard, Meyer
and Matyas, Koblitz, etc.).

As for implications, textbooks rarely get into the good stuff. Some
magazine articles are best. "Wired" issued 1.2 and "Whole Earth
Review," Summer 1993, are some sources. (I'm biased, though, as the
articles quoted my point of view.)

Hmm, what a convenient way for someone to send out hidden commands to
certain phones. Just think, some agency could just call up your number,
send this magic sequence, and your LEAF is gone, revealling all!
With 80 bits, they can afford a large subset of keys that is never
generated by the "normal" process, this allows lots of room for
hidden commands as well as "syntax checking" of the session key.

[Now, mind you; I know that the US government and all the people who
work for the various agencies have the highest possible integraty and
could never entertain the merest thought of the possibility of being
part of anything of dubious legality. So it is clear that the hardware
is not designed to have this capability; and even if this capability 
was a by-product of some other legitimate requirements, it would never 
be used.]

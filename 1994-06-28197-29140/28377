Aren't VPs also elected by the Electoral College ( who also elects the
president- the people only elect the College)? Hasn't there been a case
last century where the VP was a different party from the president
because of a close vote in the college? My memory of a foreign 
country's history is not good enough right now.
I.e., I don't think it is automatic.

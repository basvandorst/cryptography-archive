Both schemes are not satisfying. The source code (or at least the algorithm)
 has to be known. If your system is not secure if someone else knows the
 algorithm, then it's no secure at all. If on the other hand the strength of
 the algorithm is the key/RNG/whatever, then i see no reason why not post it
 too. It's reasonable to assume a determined enemy would steal/bribe/debug
 the algorithm/associate/program and get a picture of the algorithm.

: If that did not work, I'll provide more clue. In a week.
: This way we will know who is the best decrypter.

You'll probably learn the luckiest one..or maybe the more determined..
For all one knows when he sees a ciphertext, it could be anything..from
 the plaintext with the 8th bit turn on to tripleDES/IDEA/LOKI encrypted.
Unless it's about some character substitution/transpositiob method, which
 is trivial to solve (well, most of the times at least).

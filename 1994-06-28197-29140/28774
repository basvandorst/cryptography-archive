I think you may be missing the point.  Any checksum which will be
accepted by a Clipper chip DOES contain information about the
session key.  Even if you are using a rogue setup, the 'random' LEAF
field which you send is chosen because it does contain information
about the session key.  The checksum is computed from several
variables, all of which are known to an attacker with the exception
of the session key.  So, the attacker takes the checksum, and using
the known variables (IV, serial number, etc.), "distills" out the
16 bits of information from the session key.

It is curious to note that the approximation used to judge the strength
of Skipjack was that computing power doubles every 18 months.  So,
assuming that NSA could crack DES when it was released in 1977, and
power is doubling every 1.5 years, NSA should now be able to crack keys
which are 17 * 0.667 = 11 bits longer that DES, or 56 + 11 = 67.  Pretty
close to the number which they need to crack into Clipper chips without
going to the escrow agencies (64).  Methinks that Clipper may only be
good if you actually super-encrypt the LEAF, in which case why bother.

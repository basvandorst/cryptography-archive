Not only that, but also the cypherpunks are between a rock (the U.S.
Government) and a hard place (their view of RSADSI) on this one and so are
unlikely to break this logjam.

What will probably happen is that the non-governmental world will use one or
another RSADSI approach (as most already are), and the DSS/DSA/SHA will be
used in a compartmented way for communications with the government--for
example by being built in to tax filing software.

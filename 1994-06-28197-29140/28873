Would it be possible to do what I was saying before (getting from an
encrypted block of data which was encrypted with KEY1 to an encrypted block
of data that is encrypted with KEY2) by modifying the DES algorithm itself?
Possible by chaning the keyschedule or maybe the inputs to the S-Boxes
or the S-Boxes themselves?

Question: Why doesn't Bob give the uncompressed/unencrypted program to
Carol after he decrypts it with the key? Don't you need some wierd copy
protection on the which makes it mandatory that the CD be present when the
program is run?

Better question: why use copy protection at all? It frustrates your honest
users while doing S---t F--k A-- to impede dishonest hackers.

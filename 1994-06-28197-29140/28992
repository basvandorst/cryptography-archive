   I'm pleased to announce the release of an unofficial version of PGP v2.6ui

   A couple of notes: keys that are larger than 1264 bits will not be readable
   by previous versions of the software, so users who are interested in larger
   key lengths are encouraged to move up. Also, considering the enormous amount
   of time it takes to generate a 4096 bit key on a 486 (10 1/2 hours), an upper
   limit of 2048 or thereabouts is strongly recommended.


This is one of the saddest postings I've read for a while.


I mean, what's the point of going to all that effort?  The end product
is virtually useless.

Keys larger than 1024-bits are almost guaranteed to be incompatible
with the rest of the world's PGP implementation.  This is a more
accurate statement than the announcement of "1264".  Given that much
of the world is going to PGP 2.6 (limited to 1024) or has 2.3 (upper
limit varies from platform to platform), 1024 is the safe upper limit.

Key generation is said to be too slow in the announcement message
itself.

The best known attack on RSA is factoring the public modulus.  The
current state of the art is 425-bit.  512-bit keys are beginning to
look vulnerable.  In a paper to be published later this year, we
(Atkins, Graff, Lenstra and myself) argue that 512-bit keys are
currently vulnerable to an organization wishing to spend several
million dollars on hardware and wait the best part of a year *per
key*.  Even 600-bit keys would be phenomenally difficult; 1024-bit
keys are far, far beyond current capabilities.  We cannot presently
give precise estimates of the resources needed to factor kilobit
numbers, but we can say that their cost is of order hundreds of
thousands to millions times greater than our current capabilities.


Very clever, but not very intelligent.

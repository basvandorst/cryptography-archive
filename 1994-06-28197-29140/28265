Not true. If A scrambles (via the steckerboard and rotors) to X, then if
both the A and X keys are pressed, neither lamp will light. Remember
that the lamp was connected through the corresponding key up:

                          contact when key released
    -ve bus ----[lamp]---+
                         +===+-----> to steckerboard
    +ve bus -------------+
                          contact when key pressed

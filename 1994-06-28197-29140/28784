The three following paragraphs were said by Hurricane 
(huricane@max.tiac.net).  The second and third are from the same article.

This user has done what I hate most.  Spread his wild assumptions around 
as if they were possible.

:        Obviously none of you read Wired! In the first or second issue
:(I forget which), there was an article about a couple of hackers hacking
:a digital phone! Without buying a buttload of software. Get real -
:anything can be hacked on street level, and will be, shortly after it's
:release.

First off were talking about encrypted phones.  Don't blab about hacking 
regular phones.  you obviously didn't bother to read the post to which 
you responded.

:       And you think that hackers who are willing to take apart a
:cellular phone and deduce teh assembler code of the internal computer and
:all other pertinent information aren't going to hack out a shortcut
:through GSM? Odds are, hackers have already done it.

Doesn't your simple mind understand yet that GSM is ENCRYPTED and it 
doesn't matter if hackers have figured out how it works?

:        ROTFL!!!! I want to see this group. I'd prefer it if the files
:were *.mod's - they're smaller, and there's more cross-platform
:compatibility, but that's just a stupid little *.nit. You'd see a
:tremendous decrease in cellular traffic...

Besides the wierd acronym ROTFL you are without a clue as to these sound 
formats.  MOD format is not a compression scheme for sound, it is a data 
file for music.  The actual sounds in the file are still typical sound 
files but they're only samples.  You definetly don't deserve to post in 
sci.crypt with this crap.

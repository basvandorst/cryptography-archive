I was just looking at the username/password file that this program
generates.  Besides setting the "H"idden attribute on the file, they
used a trivially simple means of encrypting the data, at least that's
the way it looks from my two sample entries.  I made two users, with
the same password as username: abcdefg and hijklmno (both lowercase).

Here's what the file has in it.  Note that CR/LF pairs are in the clear:

9A 9D 9F A1 A3 AF A7 7B A3 A5 A7 A9 AB AD AF 0D 0A
A2 A4 A6 A8 AA AC AE B0 7C AB AD AF B1 B3 B5 B7 B9 0D 0A

It appears that they modify their shift/flip pattern from one entry to
the next.  The separator (using the presumed algorithm) looks to be
the digit "1" in the first line, and it increments in the second.

Has anyone already taken this file apart and produced a general
algorithm that describes the process?

	I don't think we need to get quite so paranoid to admit the
possibility that intelligence agencies could have an unfair influence
on Congress, simply because some members of Congress likely believe
that "national security" is an overriding concern, and that
intelligence agencies specify what "national security" is.  We don't
need complex conspiracy theories to believe that some members of
Congress would act this way of their own volition.  Now the question
to ask these thirteen is:  Did a representative of any intelligence
agency persuade you, contrary to your former belief, that this bill
was detrimental to the national security, causing you to vote against
it?  This would be an interesting thing to get a reply to.  In fact
the FOIA might cover a request as to whether influence in this
vote was attempted.

No, that's the hardcover version; Kahn says so in the preface.  The
paperback (I have both) is missing most of the technical details, the
footnotes, and a few of the minor chapters from the end.  Again, read
the preface -- that was done solely because of the book's size.

Bamford's ``The Puzzle Palace'' gives some of the deletions from the
hardcover edition.

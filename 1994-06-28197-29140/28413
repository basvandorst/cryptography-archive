It's could be a bit easier than that, but you'd need the algorithm
and family key to do it by theory; otherwise you're reduced to brute force,
and 2**80 is still too slow for that when you can't fab your own chips.

The problem is the LEAF checksum depends on IV and/or session key -
otherwise you could just substitute a known good LEAF from some other
conversation and the far end would accept it.  So you need to find a
rogue LEAF that matches your session key, and since you can't see the
checksum field without decrypting by the Family Key, you need to try
out a bunch of keys to find out.  (It's possible that they're using
an encryption mode that makes it possible to use the encrypted
checksum instead of the plaintext checksum, but it's highly unlikely.)

On the other hand, depending on your key exchange method,
brute-forcing the key space may be fine.  With RSA, you're generating
the key yourself, so you can pre-compute a pile of keys and LEAFs.
This is fine for email applications.  For Diffie-Hellman,
which is probably what most Clipperphones and Clipperfaxes will use
(because it doesn't require any pre-arrangement if you're not worried
about active-interloper wiretaps), if everyone always generates a
different random key-half, you get a different session key each time,
so you can't brute-force the key space.  But if everybody always
uses the same key-half for their end of the conversation,
and you know what your secret key-half is, it's easy to pre-compute.

Yes, but it's *tough* to fit 100 Tessera cards in the laptop PC
you're using as a cellphone :-)  And they're not likely to sell you
enough raw Clipper chips to roll your own Clipper-spoofer hardware.

If you are using a 16-bit key (which is what a 16-bit random seed is), then
brute force is a trivial solution.  It wouldn't be pleasant to do by hand, 
but cryptanalysts don't do things by handing.  Writing a program to plow 
through the keyspace would be trivial, and this code could be cracked within
a few milliseconds.


In order to make brute force unworthwhile, you will need at least 4-5 times
the number of bits of keyspace.  (DES, for example, uses 56-bit keys, and it
is has survived most attacks, but many people consider it to be questionable.
Triple-DES, which uses 112-bit keys, is considered to be secure.)


There are many good texts on crypto.  If you are interested in the subject,
I recommend you buy/check out one of them.  Crypto is an interesting field,
so I think you won't be disappointed.

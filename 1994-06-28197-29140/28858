Hi all!
I've been following the thread about his disk for a while now. I also
got the book, but no disc (UK).
Would it be possible for somebody to post a DESCRIPTION of the contents
of the disc?
I mean a list of the files and a short description of what's in it, so
that I know what I miss (or what I have to look for).
Talking ABOUT the contents is not forbidden, is it?

Many thanks!
Volker

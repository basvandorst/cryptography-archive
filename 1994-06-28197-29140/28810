In response to my letter during the public comment period re the
adoption of escrowed encryption, in which I pointed out the
impossiblity of keeping this information secret, NIST/NSA dramatically
downsized its estimates of the security of the technology used in
clipper.  Their response now is to estimate a time of 1-3 years, and a
dollar amount of $1M.  I pretty much agree with these estimates,
though they are perhaps a bit on the high side.  What is remarkable is
that they admit that the barriers are so low.

The reason is the patenting of the Skipjack algorithms.  Even if it is
reverse engineered, they will release the patents (now held up for
national "security" reasons), and prohibit the manufacture (or at
least import) of clipper compatible equipment.

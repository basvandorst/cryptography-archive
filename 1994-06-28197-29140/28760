This is the worry.  I think that as the nsa has made a point of not saying 
what they use to generate the session key(correct me if I am wrong, this may 
be a regan quote:-) they could use something sequential, or based upon the 
time(time could include an internal clock running of the same cmos backup 
stuff, or just a counter).

The new system would be safe if the session keys were generated randomly, 
but not if they arn't.

Roger.

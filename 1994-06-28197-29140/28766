Is it possible that making free and unregulated International communations
a quagmire could be the general idea?  So to communicate effectively,
one will have to, in effect, register their ID and get gov't permission
on BOTH ends?  On the US end via using Clipper-fied equipment with all
that implies, and on the non-US end by forcing the non-US government to
OK and the party to use Clipper-fied equipment?  I get the feeling the
large volume of free and unregulated communications possible currently
is a real thorn in the side of the power/control freaks, and what better
way to grab control and power than to impose an unwanted and incompatable
protocol with all sorts of registrations and hooks for analysis and
monitoring?  Not only the hooks for eavesdropping, but since each chip
or its ID value would be assigned to an individual or at least a
corpration...  that would put a real chill on people or entities allowing
others to use their equipment, especially if the registeree is held
responsible for ALL actions of whoever uses the equipment...

The usual battle cry of governments when they see something that is
not regulated to any extent:  "We gotta institute some CONTROLS..."

Those in congress only care about how it will impact them PERSONALLY,
or how something impacts their buddies/cohorts (media coverage on the
self-serving and anti-freedom aspects of the Clipper agenda has been
virtually nonexistant).  The basic rule seems to be that if it REDUCES
government power, it is almost uniformly dismissed, if it INCREASES
level and scope of government power, it is pushed with untiring dedication.
Look at the health care of gun issue for a couple of current examples.
Both are pushing for a GOVERNMENT MONOPOLY in the respective areas, and
working to put the people into a 'like it or lump it' situation.  In
both cases, the people are being told what is expedient, not what the
facts are.

Why would communications be any different?  The criterea are (not
necessarily in order) MONEY, EGO, JOB SECURITY, and POWER.  And, as
usual, those working for or in government (and those with the 'right'
connections) will be made exempt from the rules imposed on the rest of
us, and those doing the controlling are made immune from any legal action
holding those guilty of abuse responsible for their actions by language
stuck in the laws for that purpose.  Look at most of the anti-Second
Amendment rights laws or FBI wiretap bills for sterling examples.

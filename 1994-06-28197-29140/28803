	" A Computer Scientist has discovered a flaw in coding technology that
the American government has been promoting as a standard for electronic
communications.
	Matthew Blaze, a researcher at AT&T Bell Laboratories, says someone
with sufficient computer skills can beat the government's technology. Private
Industry has been urged to adopt the so-called "Clipper" chip as a standard
encoding system, as telephone and computer messages cannot be read by an
outsider but can be decoded by government law enforcement agencies.
	Officials fear that without such a system, electronic eavesdropping
would be useless against criminals. But Mr Blaze says the flaw would not
permit a third party to break a coded computer conversation.
	The US National Security Agency, which helped to develop the system,
does not dispute the flaw's existence, but believes Clipper remains useful
anyway. "

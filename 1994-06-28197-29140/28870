   I'm interested in historical examples of successful traffic
analysis that show how it was done.  For example, the work would
include call signs, frequencies, message headers, operator chatter
and then go on to show how the traffic analyst reconstructed the
radio net AND what advantage was derived from this.
  I'm aware of the "Zendian Problem" book from Aegean Park Press. 
I'm looking for more examples.

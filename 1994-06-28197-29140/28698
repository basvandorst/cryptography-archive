Yes.

Given n objects, there are n(n-1)/2 pairs.  If all pairs must have
distinct identifiers, the identifier space must be substantially
larger than n(n-1)/2.  This comes from the bizarre-seeming fact
that once you have 27 people together, you have good odds of having
two woth the same birthday.  Intuitively, many people would think you
need a number comparable to the number of days in a year, but it doesn't
work that way.  Yes, you need 367 people to be *sure* that two have
the same birthday, but many fewer to make it very likely.

I think quadratic only merits one "much", myself.  128 bits was
chosen becuase the work of generating 2^64 (or so) hashes to find
a collision was considiered infeasible.  80-bit skipjack and 160-bit SHS
seem related by the same logic.

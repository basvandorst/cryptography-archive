The level of discussion in this group seems to have dropped to an all-time low
recently, so I guess it's time for the semi-annual "lets create a moderated
group" effort.  In a few days time I'll post an RFD for sci.crypt.moderated
with a charter along the lines of "sci.crypt without the junk", and multiple
moderators (any volunteers?  I'll do it, but I'd like a few other people to
lend a hand as well).  Just thought I'd give everyone advance warning so they
can unpack the flamethrowers...
 
Peter.

I have received many people who are interested.  So, to make this challange
more intersting.  I'll do this:

On wednesday June 22end, I'll post an encrypted massage to the net at 2200
Central time.

If no one could decrypt it for a week, I'll post 10 known texts and their
corresponding encoded form to the net.

If that did not work, I'll provide more clue. In a week.

This way we will know who is the best decrypter.

                 With highest regards,
                      Babak   Sehari.

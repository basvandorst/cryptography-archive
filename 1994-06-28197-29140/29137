Just use the random number generator. Sounds like the simplest solution to me.
But none of these registration or copy protection schemes seem to work well.
I remember when Lotus tried it with 123, you had to insert a certain disk in
drive A:. It wasn't popular, and everybody figured out how to hack it before
too long.
 
If you're interested in hashing algorithms, see Donald Knuth's books on
algorithms. They're all in there.

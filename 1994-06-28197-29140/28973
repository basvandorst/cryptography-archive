Nuh-uh.  My eyeballs do twitch, but not this time.  Look at pp 50-51.  
McConnell is on the left gesticulating with his hands (imploring?).  Diffie
is on the right.  They are eyeball to eyeball.

You're thinking of the intro pages, 44-45, PZ on the left page, FBI agent 
Jim Kallstrom on the right.

I think the McConnell/Diffie picture's statement is more subtle.

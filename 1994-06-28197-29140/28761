Where have they said that the session keys were not based upon the chip keys.

If they are not at all random, but seqeuential(still would make good keys, 
if you use another key to obscure that sequence) then this is not true at 
all.

Again, does anyone have any reason to believe that the session keys are 
generated randomly?

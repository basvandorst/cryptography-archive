Summary: Reference Please: Assymp fomula for factoring time.
Keywords: factoring, time, length

orry- a few weeks ago the assymptotic formula for factoring time 
(as I recall exp( c (ln(N))^(1/3) (ln(ln(N))^2/3 ) with c about 2)
was given in one of the messages here. At that time I did not save the
reference (or the message). Now I need it for a paper. Could someone
pls give me the reference? 
Thank you very much

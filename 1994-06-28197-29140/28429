My understanding was that Demming, et al, looked *only* at the Skipjack
algorithm itself.  They found no problems in the very short time that
they had available.

They did not look at LEAF handling, key exchange, session key
generation, or unit key generation.  They did not check that the design
matched the algorithms, the chip masks matched the design, or the
manufactured chips matched the masks.

It's the kind of goof that implies to me that it simply didn't get a
good design review.  If it turns out that the checksum algorithm is
something that can be cracked (say a LF shift register), *then* it will
start looking like incompetence ....

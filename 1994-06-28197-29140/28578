	As much as I generally hold the writings of Mr. Murray in the
highest regard [true], I'd have to jump in and disagree here. Or at
least split hairs.

	It's only a crime in the US. He may have meant that if someone 
in Europe or Austrailia had the disk (don't ask me how), he would
appreciate a copy. As they often say on t.p.guns: the USA is not the
only country on the 'net.

	Of course if someone in the US actually accomodated his
request, they would be breaking the law.

The original mail header was mangled beyond all recognition, but it
still managed to make it to me.  However, since I cannot return your
mail (I couldn't determine the from address), I'll post your reply:

Being a tick early would not affect the possibilities-- after all there
are still 26 positions around the wheel. It could affect the selected
lamp however! However, the chart posted, seems to indicate the "notch"
and "window" positions to specify where rollovers occur.

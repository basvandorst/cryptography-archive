Re this thread--How many of you are familar with J.Edgar Hoover's
abuse of power?  He *both* abused his power and was the subject
of abuse by organized crime.  He did it by having knowledge of
embarasing or criminal actions of politicians.

Now, I ask you, is there any person or agency in the US government
which might *have* this kind of information about members of 
congress?  Would they use it to save their jobs (and incidentally
"protect the American WAY OF LIFE")?  The first question is certainly
true.  The second might produce a 13-0 vote.  Keith Henson

Yes, Compromising the Key Escrow database would mean that anyone who has
the Family Key and can perform SkipJack calculations can crack all
Clipper conversations, i.e. cops can break all your calls.

John Gilmore, noticing that the Key Escrow database is not classified,
and probably cannot be classified without limiting its use substantially,
filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for a copy of it.
The government has a time limit within which they are required by law
to respond to FOIA requests, but one of the escrow agencies has (last
I heard) not responded in time; the other is asking for a bit more
time and he's cutting them some slack.  Since the initial users of
Clipper will be government agencies, this means that *they* won't be
able to hold even semi-secure conversations with Clipper because any
cop with a Clipper decoder will have their keys, even if the NSA
didn't have them already.  They're *not* happy campers. :-)

It depends on how easy it is to determine the chip-unique wiretap keys
from the serial numbers.  In the NSA's original description of how
the Key Generation Bureau were going to generate the keys,
they'd have to steal only two "secret" parameters to re-generate each batch.
They've since announced that the method will be "different", but
haven't described what it will be, at least to the public.
Maybe Dorothy Denning knows.

Anyone who has read Simmons' recent articles on the digital signature algorithm
should not find it surprising at all. It just means that anyone who knows the
family key now has a nice easy covert channel - they can generate LEAFs which
will be accepted by any Clipper chip but whose 80 bit encrypted key field
contains a covert message.

Even if you do not know the family key, you can still use the LEAF to
communicate, but at the cost of the kind of precomputation which Matt Blaze
reports. In this case, your secret message would just be the LEAF itself
modulo some secret prime number known to you and the recipient.

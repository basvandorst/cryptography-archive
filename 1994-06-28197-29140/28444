Most of us in this discussion, I think, have taken civics classes;
they're required in most (if not all) United States high schools.
Many of us, however, do not believe everything we were taught in
civics class.  Some of us, in fact, are such radical extremists that
we think our government sometimes lies to us.

If I believed everything I was taught in civics class, I'd probably
have no qualms about supporting the Clipper proposal.

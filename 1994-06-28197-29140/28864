: From: tk@ai.mit.edu (Tom Knight)

: In response to my letter during the public comment period re the
: adoption of escrowed encryption, in which I pointed out the
: impossiblity of keeping this information secret, NIST/NSA dramatically
: downsized its estimates of the security of the technology used in
: clipper.  Their response now is to estimate a time of 1-3 years, and a
: dollar amount of $1M.  I pretty much agree with these estimates,

This, then, must be the timescale for instituting a complete ban on
non-escrowed cryptography.

Assuming that the adverage person could not use this information, but that 
the government could, and that the session key is not chosen at random(I 
believe this is true, and as I have said, I would appreciate any cite in 
government or spokesperson discriptions of the algorithm used which 
specifically says or implies that it is chosen *at* *random*) then you could 
have a "cracked" system which is still totally secure from the outside, but 
not with the summ of the inside knowledge of the database.

What I am trying to say is you have no garuntee that the session key 
contains 80 bits of data.(or am I missing that it does?)  Some of these 80 
bits could come from the chip-key, which *does*(perhaps, you would hope) 
contain 80 bits of info.  Without both, an outside atacker would not have 
any significant advantage if the algorithim is secure, yet an inside atacker 
would.

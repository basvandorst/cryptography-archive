Maybe my newsfeed is just slow today, but I see no discussion in these
newsgroups of the report in today's "New York Times" (6-2-94) that
Matt Blaze of AT&T has found a way to defeat the intent of
Clipper/Capstone/Tessera/etc. by effectively spoofing the LEAF field
and thus making communications unreadable. (This is _not_ just
preencryption, as I understand it.)

If so, this seems to imply several things:

1. The "independent review" was apparently not very thorough. (Of
course, the team only met a few times, or less, and Professor Denning
has said that she was unable to break Clipper with the time she had on
a Cray, suggesting a brute-force approach rather than the kind of
attack Matt Blaze tried. In their defense, but of no help to the
proponents of Clipper, cryptanalytic attacks _often_ take years to
reach fruition, which is one reason not to trust algorithms which have
not withstood years of attack, especially _secret_ algorithms.)

2. This seems to imply NSA is waning in cryptographic competence,
unless the flaw is either not a real one (time will tell). If NSA
assumed that keeping parts of the system secret would stop attacks
such as Blaze has apparently discovered, then they made a very serious
mistake.

3. Blaze says in the article that the flaws can probably be fixed
(for his exact words, see the article....I've mostly seen discussion
in the Cyperpunks group and haven't yet had a chance to see the
original article...mea culpa). But this fix will mean redesigns,
affecting vendors. Of course, commercial acceptance of Clipper has
been invisible, as near as I can tell, so this will not affect
"volume" shipments.

4. The talk about a patent fight by S. Micali over "key escrow" is
another factor.

This all will likely further undermine confidence and help to "Sink
Clipper!" as the great tee shirts from RSA Data Security Inc. say.

I'm not crying.

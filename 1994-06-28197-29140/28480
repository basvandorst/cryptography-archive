Read the paper!! 
Actually the govt CAN tell that the LEAF has been spoofed. According to Blaze
the actual thing that gets sent out is the encrypted LEAF (encrypted with the
secret family key) So the LEAF blower just randomly searches for 128 bit 
encrypted strings which will pass the chip (using the session InitialValue
block) Thus when someone uses the Family Key to decrypt the bogus 
encrypted LEAF, not only the escrow key encrypted session key but also the 
unit serial number are messed up. Thus they need only look for the same phone
sending out different serial numbers to know that that phone is blown.

Nathan, since encryption algorithms are considered munitions by the U.S.
Govt, you have to apply for an export license before you can legally
export one.  If you want to make it available to the public and place it
on a BBS or in a directory people can use via anonymous ftp, you'd better
put a disclaimer there.  Try FTP'ing to soda.berkeley.edu and looking in
the "cypherpunks" folder for an example.

I would like a copy, by the way.  I am a U.S. citizen residing in the
U.S.  Thanks!

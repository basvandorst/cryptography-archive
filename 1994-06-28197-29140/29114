A few days ago, I finally decided to write a (macintosh) program that I had been meaning to do for a long time.  The program takes a file and encrypts it with IDEA using a MD5 hash of the password typed in by the user.  It then stores the file in the lowest bit (or bits, user selectable) of a sound file.  I can not here any real difference in the sound afterwards, and it makes it hard for people to tell if you have encrypted data on your machine.
 
There was a program called Stego that did this with pictures.  I didn't like it all that much for two reasons.  It only worked on uncompressed pictures.  A 32 bit color 640x480 pictures is about a meg.  Most sounds are smaller.  Also, it tells you if the picture has data in it when you open it.  My program can't tell if there is data in the sound unless the password is right.
 
I have a few questions:
 
1.  How can I legally distribute this program?  Is it legal to export programs that use IDEA and the MD5 hash?
 
2.  How hard is it to tell if the lowest bits of a sound are just sound, or are really encrypted data?
 
3.  Does anyone care for a copy?

H'mm. A post from jim thomas in a newsgroup I haven't yet kill-filed him in,
sci.crypt.  Well, this one sems to discuss substance and is worth commenting
on. Since it has NOTHING to do with most of the newsgroups he posts to,
though, I've made the appropriate change to the followup line.

Odd. I thought that was the principal characteristic of many of your
messages. :-)

You don't know much about the New Yorker. The piece was in the back, where
they publish slice-of-life experience items, and was of a length consistnt
with that. The contents were entirely appropriate to that--one newbie's
experience with flames.

Serious New Yorker pieces are much longer, come much earlier in the issue,
and are usually featured. To my knowledge the New Yorker has not yet done a
serious cyberstory, and it's clear that the piece "My First Flame" wasn't
intended to be that. The title and header, to experienced New Yorker
readers, confirm it as a "slice of life" short piece.

So it would seem that what your attack on the piece in the above message and
your even harsher attack elsewhere did was, what was it? "falsify issues,
misrepresent facts, and subvert attempts to generate dialogue."

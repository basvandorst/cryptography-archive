I went to an internal sales pitch/demonstration on Netlock.  The main
thing that Netlock seems to protect against is sniffing of data 
between two machines.  In order for Netlock to secure data the two
end machines must both be using Netlock.  It definitely does a good
job at encrypting the traffic.

Since it wasn't intended to protect the machines themselves it
will not stop someone from cracking the platform itself. (Unless
you include all your machines within a Netlock security domain
and don't allow outside access to them.

PS - by asking awkward questions at the Demo they gave me a 
demo version of the software.  Now all I have to do is install it.

I hadn't thought of that.  This is the risk of letting an unknown and
untrustworthy agent create algorithms for your "benefit" without
you having the right to check their work.

Yeah, what's to stop them from issuing keys: x00000000000000000000h, then
x00000000000000000001h, then x00000000000000000002h etc for us peons
who encrypt only by the benevolence of our government?

Hi all --

I'm having a hard time breaking random number generators which
are built by combining + and rotate.  Does anyone know of any 
techiques for dealing with that combination, or with nonlinear 
equations in general?      rotate(x,3) = ((x<<3) | (x>>(32-3)))

Also, are there any standard approaches to breaking ciphers that 
use indirection?  Something like x_(i+1) = x_(i-x_i) + ...

PS  I noticed that rotate and +, mod 2^n, is much like * and +,
but mod (2^n)-1.  Specifically, 
 a+rotate(b,3) mod 2^n mod (2^n)-1 == a+8b -or- a+8b-1 mod (2^n)-1
so every rotate adds one bit of uncertainty to my otherwise linear
equations.

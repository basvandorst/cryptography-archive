I have received a number of requests for how to reference my
"Efficient DES Key Search" paper.  For various reasons, I did not
publish it in the proceedings of Crypto '93.  I have made the paper 
available as a technical report out of Carleton University.

However, Carleton is not set up to handle too many requests for
copies.  I'm not sure how much demand for the paper is left, but please
try anonymous ftp first if you would like a copy.  As of today
(1994 June 7), the following two sites still have postscript versions:

ripem.msu.edu:/pub/crypt/docs/des-key-search.ps
black.ox.ac.uk:/DOCS/security/des_key_search.ps.Z

The paper can be referenced as follows:

M.J. Wiener, "Efficient DES Key Search", TR-244, May 1994, School of 
Computer Science, Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada.  Presented
at the Rump Session of Crypto '93.

This a little more conventional than "available by anonymous ftp".

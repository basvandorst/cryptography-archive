Sure - and it's hardly surprising that a conversation with a conformist 
is less secure than a conversation between two people who want to
protect their own privacy.  Unless both ends do their job, it's not done.
On the other hand, it solves a lot of problems -
- if you're stuck using Clipperphone, and you're talking to a conformist,
you don't have to ask if he's got a secure phone or a conformist one,
and conformist phones presumably won't have automatic negotiation of
that parameter built in.
- traffic analysis will only reveal the identity of the conformist,
not your identity - this is especially valuable if you're using a cellphone,
since the identity of the Phone Company was probably known anyway -
police who are trolling the airwaves for cellphone calls 
(which happens now illegally, leading to "anonymous tips")
will not be able to tell who *you* are from the Clipper side,
and won't be able to determine your Clipper parameters from your
cellphone info if they do decide to get a warrant for the contents.
Traffic analysis on Fax Machines is also much harder.

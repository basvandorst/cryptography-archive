I suspect the overwhelming majority of info on cryptanalysis is classified.
You might look at _Military Cryptanalysis_, Part III and Part IV, published
by Aegean Park Press, Laguna Hills, California.  I doubt that they're
introductory in nature, since they were written by William Friedman, who
directed the team that broke the Japanese "Purple" cipher in WWII.  The
NSA only declassified them after John Gilmore filed a FOIA request and
took them to court over their failure to respond.

If you do find an introductory text, please advise via email or this
group!

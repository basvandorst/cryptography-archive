I thought this was going to be enough info, until I started looking at
it in more detail. Now I have a few more questions:

>	4) Standard alphabet is on the rotor's right-hand side,
>	   permutation alphabet on the left-hand side.

	1...	Viewing the "Standard alphabet" from the RHS of rotor, do
		they appear in counter clockwise order (given the reflector
		is clockwise viewed from LHS)???

		This would lead to the conclusiong that:

		The "permutation alphabet" on the LHS of the rotor:
		for rotor I, that "EKMFL...J" appears clockwise.

	3...	Looking at LHS of rotor I, the chart:

>Rotor		Wiring			Notch	Window 		Remarks
> No.	ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
>***************************************************************************
> I	EKMFLGDQVZNTOWYHXUSPAIBRCJ	  Y	   Q

		I assume that this chart means that "E" wires to
		"E", because "E" is on a different place on
		each side of the rotor (ie. pad "E" is directly
		opposite (and left) of pin "A" on rotor I).

	4...	The notch has to do with the mechanics of rollover?
		The window character "Q" for notch "Y" (rotor I):
		I assume this is the letter shown just prior to
		the next rotor's rollover (notch Y is engaged for
		rollover). This I determined by noting that notch
		and window character are always 8 positions away.
		(Interesting that rotors VI - VIII have two
		rollover positions).

	5...	Which way do the rotors actually rotate? When
		viewed from the RHS of rotor I, my guess would
		be clockwise (such that the "standard
		alphabet on RHS goes A,B,C...Z). Is this
		correct? (letters in window should appear to
		go up).

	6...	Does the rotor advance during the INITIAL key
		press, or AFTER key release?

Having the above verified, I can then make my software work in
an authentic way. IMO, that's the only worthwile way thing to do.

Thanks!

	newbie here, just wondering if anyone had a clue on atm card 
encryption ie at the end of the string of numbers read on the magnetic strip
of the card it specifies the encryption used, a number from 0-7 
denotes the encryption used.  well, any pointers or clues?  i just 
thought it was funky the bank might use encryption of data transmitted to 
the bank from atm.  thanks. phelps@cyberden.com

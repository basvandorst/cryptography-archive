The values that help define our common-sense view of the net are under
assault. People have taken to the extreme this spurious notion of freedom
without responsibility. There are no more moral guardrails in our world. The
people who live on the medians and on the shoulders of the net are told by
their pals that they are right in the middle of the road. Nothing is wrong
any more (except, of course, conservative thoughts and expressions).

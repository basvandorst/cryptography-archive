   There was a small bug in that Enigma program I posted the other day. It 
only showed up if you used the plugboard connections, and then only if you 
chose to include the letter "A" as one of the connections. Tricky bug. I 
fixed it once before, but apparently I uuencoded an old version of the 
program. Rather than posting the whole thing over again, I will just list 
the corrections here. There are only three of them, and they all occur in 
the same general vicinity, around line label 960. Here is the INCORRECT 
version of this section of the program:

	 * FOR I = 0 TO 25: P(I) = 0: NEXT I
	   FOR I = 1 TO 13
960      PRINT "Plug connection "; I; : INPUT A$
		   IF A$ = "" THEN 1080
		   P1$ = LEFT$(A$, 1): P1 = ASC(P1$) - 65
		   P2$ = RIGHT$(A$, 1): P2 = ASC(P2$) - 65
		   IF ((P1 < 0) OR (P1 > 25) OR (P2 < 0) OR (P2 > 25))...
		   IF P1 = P2 THEN PRINT "The two letters must be dist...
  		 * IF (P(P1) <> 0) OR (P(P2) <> 0) THEN PRINT "One of ...
		   P(P1) = P2
		   P(P2) = P1
	   NEXT I
1080  FOR I = 0 TO 25
	    * IF P(I) = 0 THEN P(I) = I
	   NEXT I


   The statements with the asterisks are the ones that need to be changed. 
The corrected statements should read, respectively:

      FOR I = 0 TO 25: P(I) = -1: NEXT I

      IF (P(P1) <>-1) OR (P(P2) <> -1) THEN PRINT "One of...
      (and continue with the rest of this statement as it was originally
       posted - it's just that the line is too long to include here.)

      IF P(I) = -1 THEN P(I) = I

Now the program will be fixed. To prove that, I have included some 
ciphertext, which I generated using the following:

      Rotors: 1, 7, 9
      Reflector: 3
      Ring settings: 12, 7, 8
      Initial rotor positions: X, B, D
      Plugboard connections: AM, WG, CY, RU

Snip the text below, put it in a file, and run the Enigma program using the 
settings above. Or for a real challenge try to solve it without the program.

I'm having trouble following the notion that the LEAF attack somehow gives one
information about the session key.  As I understand it, the attack merely
discovers AN n-bit string (n = 128?) that contains the correct checksum, the 
discovery being that the Tessera will accept ANY n-bit string with the correct 
checksum as a valid LEAF.  There is no requirement that the remaining bits bear 
any information about the actual session key used.

What am I missing?

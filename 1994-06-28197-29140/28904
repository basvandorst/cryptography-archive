There have been some stores mentioned here that sell books on crypt.  
However I don't remmber the names, but, Computer Literacy in San Jose 
(408) 435-1118, has around fifteen to twenty-five crypt books at any one 
time.  They also have a store somewhere on the east coast and they have a 
mail order catalog they will send you. Thye may have their in sotre book 
catlog on-line, I'm not sure, I think they have an interenet access.

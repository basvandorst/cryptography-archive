If David had any shred of consideration for others, he'd direct followups on
posts/replies that he makes so that any subsequent discussion would only
appear in alt.fan.david-sternlight.  Then people wouldn't have to wade
through all the crap he generates and provokes others to rebut.

Since it won't happen, can all of you who desire to flame him (and he
richly deserves it), please direct followups to alt.fan.david-sternlight.
Keep your reply in the original groups to preserve continuity for those
who don't take a.f.d-s if you wish, but make a.f.d-s the only group
for the followups.  This *will* work because most DS traffic develops from
a single posting of his (I'm reminded of Harry Harrison's description of
an avalanche starting from a single bird turd dropping on the snow).

Followups redirected to alt.fan.david-sternlight.

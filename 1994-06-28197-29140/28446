   Gee, I haven't noticed that -- perhaps you could dredge up some
examples. For the most part Rege seems to be keeping his posts 
technical or at least non-political -- this *is* supposed to be 
a newsgroup for technical discussions about crypto, right?
Patent status may be borderline as far as tech content, but 
it is at least on the topic of crypto -- more than can be said
for >75% of the posts in this group.

   OK, I agree with you here. I've been meaning to mention it
to him.

  Actually Rege does not now, nor has he ever to my knowledge 
worked for apple -- in fact for the last few years has not 
worked for anyone but himself. I have known rege for about 10 years 
now as a friend and at one time a co-worker. He's one of the 
sharpest programmers I've ever worked with.

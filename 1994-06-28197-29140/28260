OK, fine, let's grant that an educated person and world leader might misspell
"potato."  Spelling errors alone aren't enough to convict Quayle of congenital
pinheadhood, granted.

So why, in his capacity as Chairman of the National Space Advisory Council, did
he declare that "there are canals on Mars, we believe, and water..."?  Why did he
announce that "it isn't pollution that's harming our environment; it's impurities
in our air and water that are doing it"?

If you don't have a copy of the Quayle Quotes file, I'll be only too glad to mail
it to you.

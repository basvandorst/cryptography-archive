Sounds to me like an updated version of Madame Defarge in Charles
Dickens' _A Tale of Two Cities_.  Her knitting allegedly included
information about enemies of the revolutionaries, coded so that only
she could interpret the stiching and list their crimes.  (I say
"allegedly" because she could have been reciting from memory, or
even making up, the complaints, and merely using the knitted items
as props to fool bystanders.  She was at least as controversial a
figure in that day as David Sternlight is in ours.)

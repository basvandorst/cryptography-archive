Ok.  Enlighten us (without the sarcasm and ad hominums).

What is the purpose of the CFR?
What is their goal or agenda (the charter, etc)?
What is the CFRs position on our Constitutional Republic?
Does the CFR advocate a one-world government or do they advocate
  a world composed of separate soverign states, each independent
  of each other?  If they prefer a one world government, who is to
  call the shots?

You, as a member, should not mind leting us know, right?

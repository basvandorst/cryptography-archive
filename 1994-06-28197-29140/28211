You left out: How many times in the past have we read of some cracker
gaining root access to a widely-used Unix machine?

Then he goes in and changes your public key directory, and checked or not
you're out of luck. It's a good idea to keep a secret-key-signed backup of
your public key directory, and update it whenever you update the public key
directory. If the spoofer isn't clever enough to catch your secret key
password, that's a little more protection. But the best is never to keep key
files on a multi-user machine--only on your "home" machine, never configure
it so another can log into your home machine, and do all encryption and
decryption on your home machine, passing the encrypted traffic to and from
any shared machine you access.

That's why some of us are waiting eagerly for a "blessed" Mac version of
PGP 2.6. Perhaps it won't be long now.

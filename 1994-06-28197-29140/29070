I recently obtained a copy of PGP over the internet from the MIT server,
specifically version 2.6. The software is excellent, but I have a question
which was not answered in the extensive documentation that comes with it.
Namely, is data encoded with PGP secure if someone obtains a copy of your
secret key ring file, i.e. "secring.pgp"? Or is the information in this file
encoded such that it cannot be used by anyone else?

I disagree.  While Seabrook came at this clueless, I think he accurately
showed a newbie's reaction to the net.  I've been dealing with a bunch of 
new users recently, and they act pretty much the way he does.

The way the net is growing, clueless newbies (and I use the term only in 
the most affectionate sense) are going to be an increasingly large 
population on the net -- perhaps a majority very soon.

They're here. They're confused. Get used to it.

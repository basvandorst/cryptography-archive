I'm looking for manufacturers of encryption/descryption chips. I am desiging
a hardware project in which we can't encrypt/decrypt in software due to the
latency. We need to encrypt/decrypt at over 10Mbits/second.

If any manufacturers see this, I can be reached at (818) 888-5673. My
postal address is:

	Kory Hamzeh
	Avatar Consultants, Inc.
	6217 Melba Avenue
	Woodland Hills, CA 91367

I would like to know about the encryption speed and approx. price in
100 and 1000 piece quantities.

Thank you,
Kory Hamzeh

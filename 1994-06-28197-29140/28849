I don't think the NSA could invalidate the patent in that way.  A prior U.S.
inventor can defeat the patent only if they didn't abandon, suppress, or
conceal the invention. ( 35 USC 102(g))  If you invent something and keep it
a trade secret and then someone else discovers it legitimately, they can
patent it and then sue you for infringment ("Patent it yourself", D.
Pressman.)  So, if the NSA discovered public-key encryption and then
suppressed and concealed it, then they lose.

The fact that a letter could NOT encrypt to itself was one of the most
significant weaknesses of the machine.

I believe the inventor of the machine claimed the machine was secure, even
if captured and the wirings became known. I believe this was something that
the Germans liked about the machine.

They must scramble to different letters, and two lamps will light.

This cannot happen. Recall the system is a closed circuit. Each key has a
unique path to a lamp.

I will try to dig them up.

No, all mechanical operations took place prior to current flowing
completely through the machine.

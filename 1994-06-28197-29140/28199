I hate to disagree with such an esteemed and learned person such as Colin,
but, in my experience, the difficulty in the use of OTPs is the 'key
distribution', ie. getting the OTP to both the xmitter and rcver.

Generation of the true random digits is not really a problem.  There is
now even a card for PCs that will do it (from diode junction noise, according
to some other poster).

But the OTP has to be 1) of length greater than expected message traffic and
2) unique to the communications pair (or group).

Number 1 means the OTP needs periodic replacement and the delivery method
needs to be secure.

Number 2 means lots of OTPs need to be in place.

While floptical drives (125 mb on a floppy) will now give a longer period
between replacement, if you are going to securly communicate with a number
of sites you will still need a buch of them :)

Just another reason PGP is useful....  Now, with 2.6, I hope we see routine
integration into mailer s/w... thus making secure communications practical
for everybody :) ... but that's another thread.

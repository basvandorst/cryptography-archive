1. I selected the standard alphabet to be on the RHS of the rotors
as this is the side where the first (right most) rotor has its input
connections from the stator connected to the plugboard. Viewing
both the rotors and the reflector from the RHS, the alphabets are 
progressing clockwise. You are normally looking at the reflector
from the RHS as this is where it has its connection pins. The LHS
has no connections.

I should perhaps clarify one point in my note no. 3. It is only the
"thin reflectors", those used in the Naval Enigma M4, that has contact
pads, the normal (thick) reflectors have contact pins. The reason for
the pads on the thin reflectors is the need for having a very thin
construction to fit in the available space. However, this means that
the Greek rotors Beta and Gamma have contact pins on both sides.

3. The wiring of the rotors was measured with a buzzer "ringing"
through the different connections. First the alphabet ring was
put in its neutral position, letter A opposite the neutral mark on
the rotor body. Next one pole of the buzzer was connected to the
RHS contact pin in the letter A position and the other pole touching
the contact pads on the LHS until one pad was found that made contact.
For rotor I this would be the contact pad in the letter E position.
I hope this clarifies the rotor wirings.

4. For rotor I, when Q appears in the window the notch Y (notch in
the letter Y position) is in the engaged position and the left hand
neighbouring rotor will step forward on the next key press.

5. The rotors move towards the operator, which means counter clockwise
seen from the RHS of the machine. This counter clockwise movement will
show each letter on the rotor's alphabet ring in a normal progression
A,B,C, etc.

6. The rotor will move towards the end of the excursion of a key.
During the first 1/3 of the displacement of a key no rotor movement
takes place. The rotor will move during the next 2/3 displacement
and the rotor has reached its new position at the end of the key
movement.

Concerning my earlier posting about the rotor turnover, somebody
remarked that I had forgot to deal with the Naval rotors VI, VII and
VIII, which have two notches in position H and U, diametrically
opposite. The Naval rotor do not in any way modify the double stepping
anomaly, only that double stepping can take place more frequently.
It also means that the rotor to the left of one of the 2-notch
rotors will move twice (every 13 steps) for each full revolution of
the 2-notch rotor.

The use of 2-notch rotors will unfortunately reduce the period of the
machine. If a 2-notch rotor is installed in the right most position 
the period will be reduced from 16900 characters to 8450. If it is
installed in the middle position it will give a period of 8112, while
if two of the 2-notch rotors are used we will end up with a period
of only 4056. A 2-notch rotor in the 3rd (left most) position will 
behave as a normal rotor as the Greek rotor does not have a stepping
lever that can engage the notches.

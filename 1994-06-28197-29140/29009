These three books have what you are looking for:

	CRYPTOLOGY: Machines, History, and Methods.
	Artech House, MA:1989

	CRYPTOLOGY: Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow.
	Artech House, MA:1987

	The two above by Deavours, Kahn, Kruh, Mellen, & Winkel

	Machine Cryptography and Modern Cryptanalysis.
	Artech House, MA:1985
	This one by Deavours and Kruh

Or were you asking that someone write down the equations for you?

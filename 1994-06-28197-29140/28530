    I realize that this may be a rather stupid question, but as a crypto
"newbie" I thought I would ask anyway in the hope of not getting flamed!
Anyway, I just bought "Applied Cryptography" and came accross the term
XOR as well as XOR'ed however I am unsure exactly what this refers to.
If anyone could point me in the right direction (I assume XOR might be the
symbol for the algorithm??) I'd appreciate it.
     Also, I'm planning on ordering the disks that are featured in
the book.  I have an MS-DOS system, however I don't have a 'C' compiler.
will I be able to run the programs, or will they be useless??
 
     Thanks and sorry for the inane questions,
     Dan

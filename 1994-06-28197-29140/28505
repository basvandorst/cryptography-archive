   Strange request indeed.  Solicitation of a felony at best; entrapment
   at worst.  Given that the NSA is so anxious for victims, I hope that
   no one in the net is so foolish as to take you up on this request.

   Given that you can simply scan the programs in, such a request is
   either very naive, or highly suspect.

Entirely sensible request, seen from this side of the pond.  I bought
AC in New York, but because I'm a European without permanent residence
in the US or Canada, I'm unable to purchase the disk.

As for scanning the text: sure.  It works.  However, there is a lot
more stuff on the disk than is printed in the book.  By a strange
irony, I wrote some of the material on the disk.  ITAR prevents me from
purchasing a copy of my own software.

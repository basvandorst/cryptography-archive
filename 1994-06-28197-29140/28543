I apologize for posting the message twice. My news reader appeared to
flake out on me when I tried to post it for the first time, so I tried
again. To my dismay, I later learned that the first attempt had been
successful, even though the software had claimed otherwise at the
time.

While I'm at it, let me mention another error that I noticed afterward.
I referred to Dan Rostenkowski as "Senator Rostenkowski." That's
obviously incorrect. It should have been "Representative Rostenkowski."
I apologize for the confusion.

Finally, if Will Watson has a complaint about my post, I am happy to
hear it. In the mean time, his Yugo metaphor offers no clue as to what
he may have disliked about my post, just a snappy remark for its own
sake.

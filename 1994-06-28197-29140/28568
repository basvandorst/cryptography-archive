You might want to play with nCrypt Light, a shareware app which provides
cryptographically secure password protection for Newton objects. We're
working on a public-key version.

The public key version of nCrypt probably *won't* be PGP compatible. Fact
is, we have to license the algorithms from Public Key Partners, and they
aren't interested in PGP compatible apps, period.

Did I mention that our prototypes run *incredibly* slow, especially for key
generation? It's really something to see a Newton take so long with one
operation that it runs out of battery juice!

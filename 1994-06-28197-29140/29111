How hard would it be to design a secure phone that would be comprised
of a PC with a modem, soundcard, and appropriate software?  I am thinking
that it wouldn't be too tough to string together a public-key encryption
function that would encrypt small blocks (fraction of a second) of sound
data at a time, send them in encrypted form by modem, and then have another
modem receive them, decode, and play.  Given a small-bandwidth (say 4Khz)
it would seem that this is feasible to do using publicly available encryption
software and modem technology.  Has anyone tried this?

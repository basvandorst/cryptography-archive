Interested in the following para:-

  Cryptographic techniques can also potentially assure anonymity in more
   prosaic exchanges. For instance, in a system designed to protect
   privacy, a prospective employer requesting proof of a college degree
   will have access to records with that information - but will only be
   able to verify that sole datum. Cypherpunks even discuss certain cases
   in which a person's name would be one of the pieces protected - for
   instance, a police officer checking one's license need not know a
   driver's name, but only whether he or she is licensed to drive. The
   ultimate Crypto Anarchy tool would be anonymous digital money, an idea
   proposed and being implemented by cryptographer David Chaum. (Chaum
   also first proposed the idea of remailers - a good example of how the
   Cypherpunks are using academic research from the crypto community to
   build new privacy tools.)

Are there any techniques for grouping these types of data?
e.g.
Lets say there is a data stream consisting of 0..1000 bytes, and I want to allow access to decrypt 'portions' to different groups of users.e.g. group X allowed to access bytes 34..57, 121..134
;group Y allowed to access bytes 48..60, 856..920.
The users could have overlapping regions that they should be allowed access to.
could the access tables be held in encrypted partial databases, such that the data owner could modify the access rights for user groups?

If, additionally, there was a possibility that access to *all* of the data could be accessed in 2 ways
1/ global key held by data owner+cyphertext
2/ combination of encrypted partial 'database'+semi public key+absolutekey+cyphertext,
would this allow both parties to feel safe?
(the absolute key is held by suitable law enforcement agency)

The data owner could feel safe that the data would only be accessed by groups that they wish, by supplying them with a semi-public key+cyphertext.

The data owner, if requested, and was not involved in any illegal activity, would not object to requests to supplying his semipublic key and suitable encrypted access table for checks by suitable law enforcement party, on the basis that it was possible to ensure that the data was not viewed by unsuitable parties, nor stored in certain forms(?), nor massageable to produce information that was not the original.

This, I guess, could be suitable for a law enforcement agency too, as they would be able to have access when thay wished, albeit with the data owners knowledge.

Additionally, as the data was not massagable, there could be no question of allegation of construction of evidence, by altering text/voice pattern speech creation/motion video manipulation.

If the govmts produced such a system, and showed it to be verifiably correct *and* released it to the free market, such that independent companies would be able to compete on e.g. hardware/software tools, would there be any need for individuals to use any other form of crypto?  If not, then they might have a case for restricting rights to protect their data in other formats.

    No, no, no!  Many states have laws requiring Electorial College
members to vote for the candidate who won the election in that state.
However, Federal law and the Constitution supercede state law in this
area, and any Elector can vote for anyone.  (I think the last time
this happened for more than one or two votes involving candidates not
on the ballot was in 1960, when an "unpledged" slate won--Nixon was
not on the ballot--and then voted for Strom Thurmond.)

According to Kahn's "Seizing the Enigma" the Germans set the rotors so
that they would kick the neighboring rotor at different points, not
necessarily when they had made a full rotation.
	The British devised a slogan for this: "Royal Flags Wave Kings
Above" as a mnenomic for when the rotors kicked their neighbors.
	"Rotor I, for example, kicked its neighbor when it (rotor
I) stepped to ring position R (from ring position Q) during the
course of encipherment. Rotor II gave its kick when moving to F, III
to W, IV to K and V to A. The Germans thought that this would create a
more irregular movement and in a way they were right. But the British
cryptanalysts soon saw that the discovery that a rotor had moved
could, if they knew the ring position of its neighr to the right,
identify that neighbor."

	BTW... what is the engima20.zip program that often turns
up through gopher? Is that the enigma emulation or something
totally different? It is a relatively large file.

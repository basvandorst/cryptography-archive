This can sometimes work to the detriment of somebody applying for a
"sensitive" patent.

A number of years ago my then employer, a large US company, applied
for a patent on my behalf.  This was then made subject to a secrecy
order and I was instructed to lock up all of my design notes in the
company safe.

A while later a very similar Japanese patent was granted at which point
the secrecy order was lifted.  Unfortunately the Japanese patent was
deemed to predate our patent even though it had been filed later.
For legal purposes the filing date may not be the date you expect
depending upon the exact wording of the secrecy order and who issues
it.

One of the company's lawyers advised me that if in the future I wished
to file a "sensitive" patent application I should file it simultaneously
in the US, the UK, and Japan so as to frustrate any secrecy order.
Fortunately I have never had the need to follow this advice.

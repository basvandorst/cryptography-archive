 I do not disagree with any of this.  BUT, I would take the first
 sentence above and direct thoughts a second way:

      However, these do not easily convert into statements about the
      "strength" of the cipher, because we generally only know
      particular attacks, and do not know if any of these are the
      "easiest possible" attack.

 Naturally these parameters are not all independent; some will be
 more important when the cipher is weaker.  And is "complexity"
 related to "function" or "strength?"  Certainly we would all like
 to find a cipher which was a trivial (low-complexity) operation,
 which produced a strong (high-complexity) ciphertext.

 Still, I think the fundamental problem is that, while we can give
 the effort involved in a known attack, we cannot know (in general)
 if this is the best possible attack.  Thus, we cannot know the
 minimum effort required for a successful attack, and this is the
 usual definition of "strength."

 Wouldn't it be nice if there were some mathematical process which
 would apply to ciphering which would automatically develop all
 possible attacks, and their related strengths?  Then we could avoid
 the sort of arguments which sound like faint echos of grade school:
 "It is too a strong cipher, it is too, so there!"

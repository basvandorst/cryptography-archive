The odds are 2**(-128) that any two specific files will generate the same
MD5 hash. Thanks to the birthday 'paradox' the odds that *any* two files
will have the same hash is much, much, higher.

If all you want to do is detect imperfections, any hash with a sufficiently
large result will do. If you want to prevent an attacker from forging an
image with a hash that is equal to one of your images, you need a one-way
hash such as MD5 or SHA.

SHA generates a 160 bit hash. Also, Schneier's Applied Cryptography
describes methods for doubling the length of a hash.

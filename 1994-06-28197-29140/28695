Why not use the human voice as a random number generator?  Use a sample 
of sound as the input data for whatever algorithm you wish to apply to 
it.  No matter how many times you say the same thing, I doubt it would 
ever repeat.  No guess can be made as to what values your digitized voice 
will have and the only way to truely capture the random data is by a 
tempest attack on the pathways of the sound card or processor.

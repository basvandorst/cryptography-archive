Technically, the answer to this is NO. However, it is possible to 
"simulate" this operation by encapsulation of the DES engine inside of a 
"black box". That is, do all crypto within a secure hardware/software 
component which has a very specific set of API calls to perform specific 
sets of functions. One function would be to re-encrypt a text block under 
a new key. While the data would in fact appear somewhere in the clear 
briefly, it would be known only within the "black box".

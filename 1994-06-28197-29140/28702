: Hello,
: I had the same problem two weeks ago, asking myself about buying an secure
: digital phone (GSM for Europe).
: I made a simple call to Motorola in Switzerland.
: The digital cellular (GSM) works like this:

: - On the same cellular channel (200Khz wide) you'll find 8 users.
: - This 8 users are sending digital packets all 1/4,7 secs in no specific order.
: - All packets are crypted with an changing code.

: So the problem is clear. For the hack you need:

: - A FM wide band (200Khz) scanner.
: - The software you will find in the developpement lab of Motorola 8-).

: The developpement of a new digital phone concept cost about 2 Million $.
: But if you really want to try the crack you must use an R&S Testing Equipement.
: That's the only solution for the moment. This equipement was build to test
: the cellular network. The hacker will find he's pleasure for only 25000 $.

: Conclusion: it's perhaps possible, if you have money to spend for the fun.

: All best, Peter.

	Obviously none of you read Wired! In the first or second issue 
(I forget which), there was an article about a couple of hackers hacking 
a digital phone! Without buying a buttload of software. Get real - 
anything can be hacked on street level, and will be, shortly after it's 
release.

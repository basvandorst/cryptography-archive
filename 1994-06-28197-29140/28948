Of what relevance are the interpretations of a pseudo-Christian
cult in determining what the ¬ib.e has to say?  God's Word (the
King James Bible) was completed and in the hands of God's people
long before SDA false-prophetess Ellen Gould Harmon White lived,
died, and went to Hell.

Who cares about the "views on prophecy" of an obese, lying,
legalistic, self-anointed "prophetess" cult leader like Ellen
White?  Why should her heretical blatherings interest me any more
than those of other such people, like Joseph Smith, Mary Baker
Eddy, Charles Taze Russell, Jim Jones, Herbert W. Armstrong, or
David Koresh?  They're all dead and burning in Hell, and thehréwritings all beckon their mindless followers to follow them into
the Lake of Fire.

Why bother, when the King James Bible already tells me that I
should ignore false prophets?  Rather than believe that "no man
knows the day or hour", like Jesus said, Mrs. White blindly and
stupidly followed William Miller and his prediction of the Second
Coming in 1844.  Does this sort of lemming behavior sound like a
true "prophetess" of God that I should follow?

Just a note about spoofing the LEAF:
You would have to ensure that both communicating devices are spoofing
the LEAF since FIPS-185 (as ammended) states that both devices are to use 
the same session key. This is so that both sides of the conversation can
be monitored.
Therefore, if you do not send out a valid LEAF and the person you are
communicating with does, your conversations are both subject to intercept.

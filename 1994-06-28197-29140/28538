XOR is a boolean function which takes two inputs and returns the difference
between them. In English, "either A or B but not both." In a programming
sense, it also refers to performing this operation in parallel for more
than one bit at a time. Most microprocessors perform AND, OR, XOR, and NOT
on machine words.

Many of the programs included are stand-alone applications. The source code
will, of course, be instructive.

I don't know that this so feasible.  Assuming the session key is
only transmitted once, encrypted by the unit key and included in
the LEAF along with the unit ID - If you use Blaze's hack and
just generate random LEAF's on both ends, even if they can try
every generated key, they don't have an encrypted session key to
decrypt; that is, the LEAF that ends up passing the checksum
test is rather unlikely to contain the session key encrypted by
the unit key as it should.  Now of course we should worry about
whether, in addition to not using all possible unit keys, they
also don't generate all possible session keys.

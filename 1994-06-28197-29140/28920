I have proposed this as a motivation for Clinton's proClipper status: 
the spooks know something Hillary doesn't.

You can imagine that when good dirt shows up on big-time candidates,
the spooks don't run to the press with it, unless maybe they really don't
like or feel threatened by someone; they keep it for their own purposes.

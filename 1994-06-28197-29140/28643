Of course, the NSA recently modified SHS to install new weaknesses, er, um,
I mean, um, remove recently-discovered weaknesses, so be careful using
any SHS code you find on the net without checking to see if it does
the new or old SHS algorithm; authors of new-SHS code will presumably
include comments about the differences, so look in the source/asm listings.

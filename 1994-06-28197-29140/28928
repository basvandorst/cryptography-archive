One would have to be an authority (trusted by us) to pose such a
challenge in a credible way. Otherwise someone could just post
gibberish as the encrypted message (in an attempt to demonstrate how
smart they were relative to us) or cooperate with the eventual
cryptanalyst (in a conspiracy to make the analyst look smart).

Read the FAQ, publish your algorithms (here or elsewhere), or take your
silly game out to the sandbox where it belongs.

secring.pgp is encrypted with the IDEA cypher using your 'pass phrase' to
form the key.

To get your RSA secret key, the attacker would have to guess your pass 
phrase.  If your phrase is subject to a simple dictionary attack, then
getting a crack would not be time consuming for most people.

Hence the emphasis on using a pass phrase which would be hard to
reconstruct.  But, remember, you have to be able to REMEMBER your pass
phrase.  (Sign me 'man who speaks from experience' :)

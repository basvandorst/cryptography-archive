The rotors will move forward during the key press and the new lamp will
be lit when the rotors come to their rest position and a new electrical
circuit is closed.

As you probably know the movement of the Enigma rotors is odometer
like and the rotors are moved by stepping levers which are engaging
a ratched wheel attached to each rotor. The stepping levers act in
parallel, but it is only on the rightmost rotor where the lever is
free to engage the ratched wheel on every push of a key. The other
two rotors will only move when a notch on the rotor to its right is
lined up with this rotor's stepping lever. Therefore the second rotor
from the right will move every time the rightmost rotor has made a complete
rotation, 26 steps. The third rotor will only move when the second or
middle rotor has made a complete rotation. Hence the third rotor will
advance one step for every 676 steps of the rightmost rotor.

But due to the mechanical construction of the machine the middle rotor
will get an extra step from the third rotor's stepping lever when this
lever is engaging the third rotors ratchet wheel. Therefor every time
the third rotor is advancing one step the middle rotor will advance two.
This also means that the periode of the machine is 26 x 25 x 26 = 16900
instead of 26 x 26 x 26 = 17576. As you can position the rotors freely
you have 17576 possible starting positions or message keys, but the
periode is only 16900.

I hope this is sort of understandable. If you have access to a
machine or close up photos of the rotor stepping mechanism it is
is much easier to visualize this operation.

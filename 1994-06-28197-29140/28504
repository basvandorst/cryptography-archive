      Be careful about trying to measure disk latency.  Systems with
buffering controllers or OSs with read-ahead may show overly repeatable
results and thus serial correlation.  This is worth bearing in mind for
software to be distributed - just because it generated random numbers on
your machine doesn't necessarily imply it will generate random numbers on
all machines.

      If you're going to try this, generate psuedo-random addresses and
seek to them.  This will produce much more random timing than sequential
reads.  The psuedo-random addresses should be different if you run the
program twice, so cacheing in controller or OS will not find the blocks
in the cache.

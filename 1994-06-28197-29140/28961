I would be ready to pay about $300 for it BUT because I am in Finland 
it does not help how much I pay for it. Other thing which is not so 
nice is that I found very nice crypto WWW site and there was lot
of interesting stuff BUT I can't get access cause I am not from
the "civilised" country. Well for some reason or another I am determined
that there should be a good FTP, TELNET, WAIS, WWW, XXX, YYY
site with all the stuff in Europe. So if someone knows pointers to 
these sites outside USA and CANADA please send me a list and
you should actually post it here also if you have guts because I am sure
there are many other persons who would put that list in a good use. 

Don't get me wrong I understand totally why USA want's to keep
it this way. Also I am not totally sure whether it is only good thing
to have strong crypto to mere mortals but at this moment I am not
convinced that it would be a bad thing either. 

FLAME OFF  <nacks>

	Interesting. Do you know how this is achieved mechanically?
	I suppose, this is too difficult to describe... but I can't
	help being curious about this.

	I can see pushing a rotor one notch
	with one keystroke quite simply, but two?  Is it possible that
	one step (middle) takes place upon key-press, and another
	after key release?  I can see this to be more easily
	accomplished in mechanical fashion. This assumption also
	leads to one different output-- however the next output
	would then agree.

	Someone else pointed this out to me as well. I mistakenly
	assumed that they were talking about an early step. I stand
	corrected. "Vewy Interestink"

	It surely would.  Unfortunately, this is not possible.
	Thanks for the information.

I knew that someone would probably bring this up :-).  Yes, the NSA as part
of the government could get away with this while a private company
couldn't, but my point was mainly that even if the NSA had invented
public-key cryptography before Diffie, the fact that they kept it secret
meant that their invention would not serve as "prior art" to deny Diffie's
patent application.

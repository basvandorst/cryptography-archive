	I have been reading Applied Cryptology, and i noticed something 
refered to as the 'three-pass' protocol. It allows two people who have 
had no prior communications (including exchanging public keys) to set up 
a secure communications chanel. It is listed as the first part of section 
16.1.
	It has one catch. It requires a symmetric, commutative cipher 
that is not a one-time pad or derivative thereof (this includes all 
stream ciphers and block ciphers in OFB and CFB modes), because, by the 
protocol's nature, all one has to do in this case is XOR all three messages 
involved, and out pops the plaintext.
	Now for the point of all this: Does anyone know a practical 
algorithm that is symmetric, commutative, not a derivative of an OTP, and 
is at least as secure as DES? The book lists one such, related to RSA, 
but I'd like to know if there are others.

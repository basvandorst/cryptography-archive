But it isn't a simple substitution. Any particular rotor position is a
simple substitution, whether or not you have a plugboard, but that only
applies to one letter. The steckering on the input side of the Enigma
has a complex effect on the rotors, so you can't just ignore it.

Right, but as I understand it finding the plugboard wiring was the hard
part of breaking the daily key.

I don't understand this at all, I'm afraid. My memory of this is hazy
(it's a while since I read the Welchmann book), but as I understood it,
the bombes didn't work like that.

As I recall, each bombe was essentially three rows of 60 Enigma rotor
sets. The 60 columns held the 60 combinations of rotors (3 from 5); the
three rotor sets in each column were the same. You now guess (or know)
some plaintext for some ciphertext. Suppose they are:

     ADOLFHITLER
     FQPVTTDAWVB
     ^   ^  ^

The three marked columns are chosen. The middle row of rotors is set 4
positions ahead of the top row, and the bottom row 3 positions ahead of
that. The rotors and some other parts, including a 26 lamp indicator on
each column, are wired up to represent the three letter pairs. Current
is injected at a point representing "A" (in this case), and all 60x25
non-"A" lamps are inspected. Any unlit lamps represent a possible
steckering for "A" for that rotor set and position. Note this down, and
rotate all the rotors one step. Repeat until all 26^3 rotor positions
have been checked, then try out the results.

I don't see how to get from this to your "pattern" cracking. Have I
hopelessly misremembered, or is there some better description (perhaps
in the Kahn book, which I am having trouble tracking down) ?

I just bought a copy the other week. What was allegedly sanitized?
What was pulled?

If there was any editing to subsequent print runs, there was no mention
of this fact in the Forward/Introduction.  It seems to me, the author usually
gets his $.02 worth in when forced to exclude material, and so far, I've
seen no evidence of this.

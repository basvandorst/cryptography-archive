I'm not sure if this has been brought up before or whether it is even a valid
concern, but I was wondering about the security liabilities of having a
nation's encryption keys stored in a central database (okay, granted it's
two databases) under the Clipper proposal.

From a paranoid standpoint, wouldn't the event of a database compromise at
both sites render all Clipper devices useless as viable encryption devices?

I've got all these routines, written in assembler for 80x86 if you want
them. A few years ago I decided to write my own RSA encryption program,
and spent a lot of time on the multiple precision arithmetic routines.
Send me some e-mail (use s25@ederr1.ed.ornl.gov rather than the address
you see on the header) and we'll figure out how to exchange them if you're
interested.
The program was written in Turbo Pascal, so the assembler routines interface
with the corresponding functions in Turbo Pascal. 

If you're going to try to write your own routines, good luck. It's not 
easy. The toughest one is division. There are a few "special cases" to
consider that can really cause problems. I consider my routines to be
correct because one of the things I did was write a routine which 
multiplied two random numbers together, added another random number, and 
then did the division to check the result. After running this for a few 
days (some millions of iterations) I think everything is correct.

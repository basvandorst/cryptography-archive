When tracing back from Common Greek as spoken in the Roman
Empire, to the Dreaded Putative Indo-European, what is probability
that the stems CHI-RHO-<whatever> KAPPA-RHO-<whatever> are
equivelent to the IE stem kri, meaning "to decide " .
Examples are Kr (in Sanskrit), CHI-RHO-<stuff>, KAPPA-RHO-stuff.
              .

The next truly off the wall question is, has anyone done letter
frequency charts, contact charts etc for ancient languages such
as Latin, Greek (Classical and Common), Sanskrit, Hebrew and Old
Chruch Slavic (also called Old Church Slavonic).



				Have Fun,

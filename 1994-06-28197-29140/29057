   I was talking to a friend tonight, and had an interesting idea for
holding onto encrypted data in such a way that it wouldn't be possible
to prove that the data was encrypted.  I'd like some feedback/ideas
about it.
 
   The basic idea is to hide encrypted data, with no headers, spread
across the unused clusters of a floppy diskette.  Then, the directory
structure for the encrypted files are held on a different diskette.
This would require bypassing DOS's file structure in writing to and
reading from the floppies involved.  It would also involve keeping a
lot of useful-looking files on the floppy disks.  This basically
requires that floppies have random-looking data in their unused
clusters, and it leads to another possibility--keeping such data on
unformatted diskettes.
 
   The obvious question is:  Would the random-looking blocks in unused
clusters be "evidence" that there was something odd going on, either in
partially-used or in unformatted disks?  In some countries, leaving a
big space for doubt about whether or not someone has encrypted files
would be enough to likely let them out of the slammer for contempt--in
other countries, it might just lead to a really unpleasant discussion
with some state-sponsored thugs about what the password to your random
data is.  (Ah.  Rubber-hose cryptanalysis rears its ugly head again.)

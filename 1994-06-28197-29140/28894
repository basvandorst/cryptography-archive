Depends on what kind of cryptanalysis you wish to do.  Are you
trying to cryptanalyze traditional ciphers?  If so, you should
check out these two:

	Solving Cipher Problems
	Frank Lewis

	The Index of Coincidence and Its Applications
	William Friedman

And they are available at Agean Park Press.

Now the only thing else we need is for someone to tell us where
to find introductory texts on cryptanalysis of contemporary ciphers.

I would have to say if definite NO.
If you were able to do this, then you would simply be able to recover
the plaintext with your knowledge of KEY2.
i.e.
Given C1=E_{KEY1}(M) for some message M, and being able to compute
c2=E_{KEY2}(M) from C1, would allow you to compute
M = D_{KEY2}(C2).
A very undesirable property.

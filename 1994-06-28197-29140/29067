Hi there.

I used to use a Canadian ftp site which archived this group.  It was
really neat; you didn't have to send email for access but they forced
you to read a "getting access" file by having the name of a secret
directory which lead to the archive itself.  The name of the secret
directory changed daily.

One got the distinct "cloak and dagger" thrill from the whole business.

Anyway, it was some sort of think-tank in the backwaters of Canada; they
mentioned that the lines to the site were especially slow.  I first got
the site from an archie server (don't remember which).  It isn't
mentioned in the crypt faq and I'd like to find that particular server.

Does anyone know the full name of the site I'm talking about?

Email replies, please.  Anyone who is interested, I'll be more than
happy to respond to you.

thanks.
 -peter

Yesterday, the House Intelligence Committee deleted the provisions of the
Export Control bill which would have allowed the export of all mass
market encryption products and thus eliminated the ITAR restrictions on
most cryptographic products.

The Intelligence Committee substituted the cryptography study previously
adopted by the Senate.  So, instead of getting strong encryption in the
international information infrastructure, we'll get a nice big study to
read and debate.

The next phrase of this fight will be in the House Rules committee, which
will have the job of resolving the dispute between the Foreign Affairs
Committee, which approved the Cantwell bill, and the Intelligence
Committee version, which removed it.  The Rule Committee will decide
which version, if any, goes to the floor of the House for vote.

Stay tuned for further news and action alerts...

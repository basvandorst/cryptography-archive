Minimal competence in the designers? I find it strange that people on
the one hand are sufficiently paranoid that they believe that NSA has
all sorts of incredible competence to be able to do things that no
academic can do ( factor 1000 bit numbers, build quantum computers)
while at the same time believing that they are completely incompetent in
designing say a checksum algorithm. 
 (Yes I know that I am assigning the variety of opinions on the net to
 some single entity, a process even more dubious than was engaged in by
 the original poster.)

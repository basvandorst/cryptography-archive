Clipper (and EES) are indeed broken from the design stage.  Government
has no business with our keys, especially when they don't let us
generate them for ourselves.  Micali's system is much better.

Even if most of us don't escrow our keys using Micali's fair
cryptosystem, it would be nice to have the option.  For example, my
firm uses keys corresponding to corporate offices (CEO, VP of PR, etc.),
and not the specific individuals in those offices, the keys _must_ be
available to new folks in those offices (in case an employee is
incapacitated, or dies).  Having the keys escrowed (one part each) with
a trusted legal firm, the corporate security office, and/or an off-shore
safe-deposit data-bank would serve just fine.

Some of us will need the ability to escrow some of our keys.  We just
don't need the government to do it for us.

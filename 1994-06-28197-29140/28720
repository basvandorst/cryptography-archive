According to two fellows from the NSA who spoke at MIT a couple of
weeks ago, there are two random numbers (plus two secret keys provided
by the escrow agency and allegedly unknown to the NSA) per *batch* of
chips, where a *batch* is one day's production.  The random numbers
were reportedly generated by measuring inter-keystroke delay on the
operator's console (funny, a certain guerillaware crypto program does
that, too :-) ).

They implied, but did not explicitly state, that the random numbers
are destroyed after unit key generation; the unit keys are produced as
a classified, but deterministic, five-argument function of the chip
serial number, the two per-batch random numbers, and the two escrow
agency keys.

In my opinion, there's room for a second back door in the key
generation process.

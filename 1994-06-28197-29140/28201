Of course there are! Modern cryptography is not a house of cards built on
factorization and discrete logarithm. The reason why the cryptosystem you are
talking about are so popular is that they are very efficient and they all use
the same basic processing (multiplications-exponentiation with large numbers).

Here are some other public key encryption functions :
- McEliece (DSN progress report 42-44 p 114-116, 1978) is built on the problem
 of decoding Goppa codes. Some improvments to its cryptanalysis are done by
 Chabaud (see preproc. Eurocrypt'94 p 127-135), but it is not yet broken.
- Matsumoto-Imai C-star (proc. Eurocrypt'88 p 419-453) based on quadratic equa-
 tions.

About zero-knowledge identification schemes, there are some new "combinatorics
schemes" that gives some alternative to the Fiat-Shamir or Guillou-Quisquater
schemes :
- Shamir (proc. Crypto'89 p 606-609) based on the Permuted Kernel Problem.
- Stern (proc. Crypto'93 p 13-21) based on the Syndrom Decoding Problem.

In my opinion, Shor's factorization results must stimulate investigations to
those kinds of cryptosystems.

Elias,
Once again I'm reading your posts and wondering why the words posturing and pontificating keep coming to mind. Your arguments (much like VMS) appear strong and well thoght out on the surface but when you really look at what's going on there you realize there's alot missing. Your verbage seems to strike out against Gov't but your examples are always about insufficient Gov't service or States Rights vs. a strong Central Govt. ( we've already had a civil war over that one and who is going to provid
e the additional services...ATM's?). You're the guy across the lab who's always right no matter how wrong you are, whose performance models are always the right one because you designed them, who's kids are perfect because they are your kids. I'm not a fan of Mr. Sternlight or his notions of govt. ( I have too many Libertarian tendencies and authority figure problems) but a career based on service to others is an honorable path. Your diatribes are wasting my bandwidth and I'm tired of it. I'm exe
rcising my right (yours too... provided by your local Constitution) of not having to listen to your dribble anymore and am putting a filter on my mailer to screen your posts out. Loosen your necktie and spincter. It's a multifaceted world out there... get a multifaceted perspective and maybe someone will listen to you.

Will Watson

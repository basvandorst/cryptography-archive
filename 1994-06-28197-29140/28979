  I don't think this is the case -- as I recall, the relevant section of
law (35 USC 102) states that one criterion for being denied a patent is
that the invention in question was "known or used" by others before the
applicant invented it.
  For instance, the current issue of _Wired_ notes that a PhD dissertation
on the shelf of an obscure European university was deemed to be a part of
the prior art, and a patent application was thrown out as a result.

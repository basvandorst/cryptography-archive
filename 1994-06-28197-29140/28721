At the present time, Saskatchewan is a province in Canada. It's OK to
export any crypto product to Canada, or from Canada to the USA.

You can strengthen your position somewhat by including a robust license
agreement which forbids export. RIPEM/Mac includes five or six pages of
legaleze telling you that if you export it, you are in deep trouble.

Yes. You may only 'transport' crypto to US or Canadian citizens within the
US or Canada. A brief provision allows for transport to resident persons
who are 'intending to take up citizenship'. We interpret this as meaning
what Canadians call 'Landed Immigrants'.

Hey, INAL, so seek qualified counsel before taking action.

I am a graduate student desperately trying to finish a paper on cryptography
policy that is part of an exam that is due Monday.  I wrote a short section 
about the need for a digital signature standard in which I mention that 
RIPEM/SIG may become a de facto standard in the absence of a government 
standard.  I just found out today that the government approved a digital 
signature standard on May 19 (I know I probably should have discovered this 
earlier, but some how I missed it.) I haven't been reading this newsgroup 
recently, but I assume there has been discussion about this.  Could somebody 
please fill me in.  What algorithm is the DSS based on?  Does it use public 
key encryption?  If so, what sort of deal was worked out with PKP?  
What is the speculation about whether or not people will actually use this 
standard?

Please send replies directly to me.  Thank you,

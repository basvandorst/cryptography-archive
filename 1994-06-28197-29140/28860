Please don't post the algorithm until some of us have had a chance
to do a ciphertext-only attack. (Some people enjoy the extra 
challenge. ;-)

Actually, I did assume the system would be released after we had a
chance to bang on it. Was I naively presuming that accepted standards
would be followed? (Probably. I've noticed the large number of people
who say ``I have an unbreakable system. Here's some cryptograms. Of
course, I'll have to keep the system secret to ensure its
effectiveness.'' I didn't infer that was the case here, though.)

Speaking of ways round having to use Clipper, how about thi : One of the
problems is going to be that manufacturers will be "encouraged" to use
Clipper as their encryption chip (where required). Why doesn't someone 
design a chip that uses a known system, with the same pin configuration,
keying inputs, power requirements etc? Incidently, how bio-degradable are
ICs when they end up in a landfill? :)

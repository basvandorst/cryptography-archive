From the Wall Street Journal, June 16 1994, page A16:

        National Cryptologic Museum
        open only on weekdays, 09:00 - 15:00.  Sheesh!

The article doesn't give an address, but says the museum is "just down the
road" from the NSA.  Directions:  "40-minute drive from downtown Washington
to the Route 32 East exit of the Baltimore-Washington Parkway".
The article's dateline (?) is Fort Meade, MD.

Sounds like a fun place, but is apparently short on post-WW II info.

You're welcome.  Sorry about the delay, but I don't read this group often.

regards, Eric

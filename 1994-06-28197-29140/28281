How has Willie "I didn't inhale" Clinton distinguished himself?  By
outdoing Pinnochio?  By choosing England instead of Canada?  Or Gore,
who was touring Monticello right after the election but before the
innauguration, didn;t even know who the busts around the
place were of...  I remember that little clip.  The guide patiently
explained they were Washington, Jefferson, etc, while Clinton had that
'where did I find THIS guy' look on his face...

Yup.  A real distinguished crew there.

Wasn't S. Willie the one who couldn't even recite "The Night Before Christmas"
right?

I am all ears to hear how Willie has distinguished himself either in
economics or foriegn affairs to become a member of the CFR (other than
by having a fairly well-heeled father, maybe).  Perhaps he became
distinguished by selling more chop job used cars than anybody else?

Methinks there is something else we aren't being told as to what
constitutes 'distinguishing oneself', at least in the CFR terms.

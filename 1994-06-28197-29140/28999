In real life, security of the encipherment does not depend
on keeping the encryption/decryption algorithm secret. The
algorithm itself should be strong enough that the security
of the encipherment depends only on the security of the key.

So when you publish your algorithm, "enough" ciphertext,
and maybe an ad for a prize, people may have some interest.

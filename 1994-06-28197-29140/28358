What exactly is your point? I do *not* exist to serve the state. It exists
to serve me. That you have chosen to "contribute to your country" is
perfectly acceptable to me, but not laudable in any fashion. You made a
living working for your country. Sounds like a respectable career.
Certainly nothing to be ashamed of, but nothing (in and of itself) which I
would take particular pride in.

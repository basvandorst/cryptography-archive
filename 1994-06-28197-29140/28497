Now I've seen a lot of things go on in this nesgroup from Sternlight
that I ignored.  First, is was raising doubts about the validity of MIT
PGP 2.5, with no foundation.  Then, when others raised doubts about MIT
PGP 2.6 not being under the GPL anymore and whether Phil agreed to it
(which I consider to be just as serious as the first "problems"), David
just trumpeted away about "now we have a LEGAL version!  Hurray!".  Now,
when he says that he has made contributions to his country, what about
the rest of us (like everyone else is a no-good person) and someone asks
him just what kind of contributions he has made, he spouts off about the
person asking being arrogant.

Sorry, but if you are going to make an unsupported claim that you have
made great contributions to your country after the other things you have
said, Mr. David Sternlight, then you shouldn't get mad when someone asks
just what you have done that is so great.

I imagine that because of this post I will be added to the "David
Sternlight Killfill Hall of Fame".  And after only one post, too!  Is
that some kind of record?

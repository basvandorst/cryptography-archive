Y'all out there:

Does anyone know anything about CheckFree security?  They are a service
with whom you register to make electronic payments to your creditors. 
I'd hate to give them the keys to my bankbook without knowing they've got
a pretty nice strongbox for 'em.

I really want to know about this!

I did not claim that the authorities cannot detect a spoof LEAF value,
but suggested that there are several possible ways of doing so.  I have
now had the chance to read the paper.  This is consistent with my
speculations, as I had expected.

A spurious LEAF as described in the paper may be detected with the
cooperation of the escrow authorities.  The variant that I described
would not only be consistent with Matt's observations but could still
be detected even without the cooperation of the escrow authorities.

In short, I am not suggesting that Matt was wrong (indeed I recommend
that people read his paper).  I am suggesting, however, that the LEAF
structure could be more subtle than people think.

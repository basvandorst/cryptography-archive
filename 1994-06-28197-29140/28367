Hi hisorians and cryptanalysts:

An UNSOLVED number theory problem as often noted in the 1650BC context of
an Egyptian papyrus-- the Rhind Mathematical--- may have been solved. The
problem has been discuss since 1892 with Sylvester's use of Fibonacci. Yet,
very early on others like Hultsch began to work with other algorithms. By 
the 1920's A.B. Chace, Brown U.'s esteemed President showed that a multiplier
was was---may be by a whim--- by the Scribe Ahmes.

Klee/Wagon OLD AND NEW UNSOLVED PROBLEMS IN PLANE GEOMETRY AND NUMBER THEORY,
American Mathematical Assn, 1991 discuss 4/23 and 5/11 by following Fibonacci
in a way that does not calculate no more than four (4) small unit fractions.
In addition Bleicher's 1980's work, as co-authored by Paul Erdos-or visa versa,
tested another algorithm--- that obtained fewer and smaller unit fractions--
but none as the 2/n the table listed its introduction for 85 simple math
problems--may be for early teenagers.

I suspect that a single algorithm can not solve the unified nature of the 2/nth
table as teenagers from the Middle Kingdom understood. David Burton, ELEMENTARY
NUMBER THEORY introduces the use of the term "unit fraction splitter", an idea
that comes closer to the workings of Egyptian thought. In passing it should be
recalled that unit fractions, as a notation--- and system of thought--lasted
for over 3,000 years--- right through the Classical period of Greece-- and
began to end when Stevins introduced base 10 decimals, to aide the accuracy
of 16th century telescopes (and business people--wishing higher interest rates).

Could it be that the first term of all unit fractions, like
2/89 = 60' 356' 534' 890' are related to the remaining terms---? To explore
that possibility teh long observed fact that 89 divides 356, 534 and 890
evenly-- obtaining 4, 6, and 10--- creates an interesting situation. This
situation is also observed in 2/61 = 40' 244' 488' 610' (again using
Greek shorthand notation) to obtain 4, 8 and 10. Well, from my point of
view it seems that ALL 2/nth terms are related such as 2/89 for LCM (4, 6, 10)
= 60 and 2/61 for LCM (4, 8, 10) = 40! That being so, additional assumptions
were made, based on my years as a cryptanalyst, from 1957-59, in the USA
military.

Could it be that Middle Kingdom Egyptians taught Greeks, and the general
diffusion and use of unit fractions took place by selecting the first
unit fraction term as a partition--- where the denominator selected contain
certain divisibility properties? Further, could not have the total Egyptian
algorithm accepted a proof that 2/n, say 2/89 could be partition following
a version of the multiplier times 2, or 120 -89 = 31 such that a small
list of composite numerators to the 2nd, 3rd and 4th terms (if all were
needed) could be selected that were factors of the selected multiplier?
Specifically, I mention 15, 10 and 6 for the 2/89 case as given by

2/89 =  1        +      15        +        10       +      6
       -----          --------           --------       --------
        60            60(89)             60(89)          60(89)  ?

I thank one and all for considering these few points. Please feel free to
drop a note to my personal email box. I'll post the results of this mini
discussion, if requested.

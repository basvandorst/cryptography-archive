It's hard to say exactly what benefit can be derived from a rogue
LEAF.  If an opponent has access to all information used to compute
the checksum except for the session key, then the checksum can
be used to find 16 bits of information about the session key.  IF
this could be done, than the search space drops down to 2^64, not
all that much bigger than the DES search space.  This is important
to keep in mind.  It would be prudent to assume that the search
space for the Clipper chips is actually 2^64, NOT 2^80.  While a
properly designed hash function should prevent those 16 bits of
checksum from being easily usable, this can always be overcome
by a massive pre-computation.

Thoughts, anyone?  Does NSA have to search a 80-bit or 64-bit
keyspace to crack a rogue Clipper session?  My bet is on 64, but
I'm sure at least one person will go for 80.

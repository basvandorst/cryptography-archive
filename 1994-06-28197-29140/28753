Hello!

We have written a password encryption app for the Newton MessagePad,
'nCrypt Light'. Currently, we distribute this as a shareware app. We have
limited the shareware version to 40 bits of effective keylength. Registered
users can obtain an unlimited version is the are Canadian or US citizens
residing in either country.

Is this strategy legal? Are there any problems with the limited version
'escaping' to foreign countries? Your comments are appreciated.

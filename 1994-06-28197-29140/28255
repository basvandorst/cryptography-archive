  No, once you have the right rotor selections and settings, all that
remains is to solve a simple substitution cipher.  The trick is to
find the rotor positions without knowing the plugboard wiring.  There
were AFIAK two methods used to do this.  If there were several
messages with the same plugboard wiring and rotor positions (or
messages with portions for which the rotor positions overlapped) it
was possible to directly recover the rotor positions without the
bombes.  (I think this only worked on early Luftwaffe nets, but it was
basically abandoned once the bombes were working.  In any case it
involved stacking messages on plastic sheets and sliding them back and
forth to get matches, so it was known as "stacking.")

  The other approach as I said used "cribs" with repeated letters.
Basically, put one of these message fragments and the expected
plaintext in the bombe, and it will ring a bell and halt every time
you get a potential match.  The favored cribs were such that the
likelihood of a match other than the right one was very low.  (Most of
these were standard format message headers with Roman Numerals.  But
one case was an observer in the Sahara, who sent, "Weather clear,
nothing to report." every day for years.  British troops were
instructed to avoid his position, since if he HAD something to report,
they might not get that day's keys!)

  Violent agreement.  Once you have the wiring, the rest of the day's
traffic on that net is a snap.

  Once you have the rotor settings, decrypt the message with the
partial wiring you have from the crib.  Now it is possible to guess
some other wires.  Repeat as needed.  It is a little more complex than
a simple substitution, but only a few minutes worth.

  Wow!  I can't imagine doing anything so labor intensive.  It is
certainly well documented that the bombes halted and rang a bell on a
possible match.

  Which one?  "Cracking the Enigma", is good, but I don't remember it
as focusing on the decryption details.  There are two pictures of bombes
at the Nebraska Avenue naval station in Washington, DC that don't seem
to match your recollections at all.  I believe it shows dials at the
top for entering 16 characters each of plain and cipher text, and
eight sets of four "rotors" below that.  (These were presumably for
four-rotor naval machines.)

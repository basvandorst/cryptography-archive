According to Gus Simmons' article on cryptography in the Encyclopedia
Britannica, the NSA claims to have discovered two-key cryptography
in the 1960's but kept it secret.  Details are lacking however.

Diffie-Hellman key exchange is entirely practical, and it predates
RSA by several years.  Presumably the NSA found out about it at
least as early as the rest of us.

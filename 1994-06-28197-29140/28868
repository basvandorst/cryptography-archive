I am a civil engineer who has had a "hobby" interest in cryptography for
a long time, and so I've been following this newsgroup for a while.  A
constant theme seems to be ... where can I find books, get info?  It has
me wondering if a mail-order bookstore dedicated to books and software in
the crypto area might be a success.  I'd much appreciate knowing if any
regular participants in this newsgroup would be interested in such a
service.
		Thanks,

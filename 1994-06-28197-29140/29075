I think a much better source is the following book:

   "The Enigma War", Jozef Garlinski, Scribner's Sons, NY, 1979.

I picked this book up years ago in a discount rack somewhere, and never 
see it mentioned in the literature on the Enigma. But the book lays out 
the operation of the machine quite clearly, and enabled me to write my 
own simulation several years ago. It is written in BASIC (sorry, those 
were the days when there were few choices in PC languages). I will be 
happy to post the program here if anyone is interested. All versions of 
MS-DOS still come with a BASICA  compiler.

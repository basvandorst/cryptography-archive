Several people have asked me when my book on Network Security will be 
out. The answer: July 8 - 15. Alas, a little confusion: the book is published 
by Macmillan which has been absorbed by Prentice-Hall. For the next 
month or so, the book will be sold by the remains of Macmillan and after 
that by P-H. Any bookstore should be able to figure this out for you. Also, 
the release of the book outside the U.S. will be delayed a month or so but 
can be ordered through a U.S. bookstore. Two that I know who are good at 
this are Quantum Books (quanbook@world.std.com) and Computer Literacy 
(info@clbooks.com).

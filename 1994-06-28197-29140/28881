This is a sample of some encrypted text I generated with an algorithm 
I wrote.  It's not the sort of thing you want to use to transmit
military tactics with, but I want to know if it's good enough for
simple purposes.  Does anyone know of a good way to test its security?

In other words, can anyone crack it?

Thanks for helping out an encryption newbie.

pparks@netcom.com    We don't see what they're made of.   
                     They shout about love, but when push comes to shove
                     They look for things they're afraid of." - Neil Peart

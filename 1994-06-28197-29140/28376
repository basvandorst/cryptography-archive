The disks don't come with the book. You order them separately. As
cryptographic software, and therefore munitions in
the sense of I.T.A.R., they are, non-exportable from the U.S. without
an export licence, and such licence is unlikely, but go ahead and apply.

Anyone in the U.S. or Canada, who can legally acquire these disks
incidently, would risk *severe* penalties by sending them to you
without such licence.

Also, the disks are not free. Whether the fee merely covers the cost
of media and shipping, or whether the author makes a couple of bucks,
I don't know, but you should check this out. You could be asking
someone to pirate them for you, adding theft to the ITAR
violation.

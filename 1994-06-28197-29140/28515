Well, such a thing is easy to write; but you have to be very careful
about security.

1. Changing the hostid reported by gethostid(2) and sysconf(2) is relatively
easy. This depends on your OS; but I've written simple scripts to do this
on Solaris 1.x and 2.x and use them when a system blows up and I have
to move an installed software package to another system in a hurry at
a strage hour.

2. The wiley hacker will just poke around in the assembler for your 
application and by modifying a few bytes, make it run without a 
licence. Not really much work.

You don't have to show anyone the source, but it would be nice. 
You must reveal the algorithm though.  If the security of your
scheme relies on keeping the algorithm secret, then you scheme
is insecure.  The security must rely in the secrecy of the key. 
Pick up the sci.crypt FAQ if you want, you might just find your
scheme described already :)

Why not post a general description or some psuedocode if you
don't want to publicly release the source?

Good luck!

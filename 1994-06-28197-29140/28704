Ah... but GSM has encryption (A5) ... not "real" but secure against
the casual eavesdropper.  None of the cellular phones in the US has
this thanks to, yes, Friends of Big Brother (not a holding company).

But you are correct in assuming 'tracking' a cellular call is not
very difficult... the $200 phones have to do it all the time!

Listened last night to a tape of Prince Charles telling Camillia he
"needed her several times a week".  When will horny folks realize
cellular calls are "in the clear" (unless they are GSM)?

Maybe we should charter a group alt.binaries.sounds.erotica.cellular-calls
and post .WAV files of interesting intercepts... THAT would get folks
attention!  (I know, I know... you are NOT SUPPOSED to listen ;)

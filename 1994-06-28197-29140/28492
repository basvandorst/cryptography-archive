David reminds me of a programmer who boldly proclaimed there were NO
known bugs in his program.  The emphasis should have been placed on
no KNOWN bugs since the guy refused to listen to bug reports.  It is true,
he didn't know of any bugs but that didn't mean there were none, just as
it doesn't mean those who disagree with David are wrong.  Wasn't it
the monkey who 'hears no evil, speaks no evil, and sees no evil' ?  Well
as Meatloaf says "2 outa 3 ain't bad."  (We can definitely rule out the
speaking no evil part.)

 Opinions only, but this is America so 
 even opinions count!

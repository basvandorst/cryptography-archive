Good point.  The trick of proving something a hoax is to show there's
non-random gibberish, or that it contains gibbering information.  Stuff
that shows clearly ordered nonsense is a good candidate, such as the
repeated "sdf" and "98" stuff in the message being considered.  My paper
about the Beale Ciphers in Cryptologia (Apr 80), for example, shows a long
alphabetic sequence in B1 when it's decrypted with the key to B2.  John
King recently showed the sequence is longer and cleaner when the right
version of the key text is used.  A more accessible writeup of this is in
Dorothy Denning's "Cryptography and Data Security".

Of course the repeated "89" characters in the message we're responding
to inspire the thought that it's a chunk of the Voynich Manuscript
transcribed with Currier's notation... and watch out for steganography.

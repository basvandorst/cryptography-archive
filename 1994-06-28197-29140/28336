Wednesday (1 Jun) night, about 11PM Pacific Time I heard a radio 
news report (NPR radio news) that mentioned that a Berkeley (I think)
scientist had discovered a weakness in what sounded like the Clipper
chip. Although Clipper wasn't mentioned by name, the description
sounded exactly like how a newsdroid would describe Clipper.

Does anybody know more about this development? Any net.sources for more
info? Anybody?

E-mail or posting is fine. If I get enough e-mail, I'll post a summary
(with names omitted).

Thanks for any information.

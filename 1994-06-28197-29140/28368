Well, you are obviously not an anarchist.

I think that government work (of nearly any kind) is a poor substitute
for honest employment and to be derided at every opportunity. And
wannabe dictators or their mouthpieces are the worst of the lot:
thoroughly despicable.

In my opinion, the great experiment in limited government is an abject
failure; governments refuse to remain limited. They constantly
aggregate and accumulate power until there is no opposing them. Looking
at people like Sternlight, it's not hard to see the sequence of little
steps, the day-by-day descent that took us from the imperfect but
nearly free Republic created by the Framers to the tattered, corrupt
mess -- on the verge of collapsing into Empire or Police State -- that
we have today.

The sooner we realize that the term "public servant" is and always was
a lie, the better off we'll be.

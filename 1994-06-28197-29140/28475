   Yes.  Originally the person receiving the second highest number of
votes in the Electorial College became the Vice-President.  This was
changed after a complex scheme was played out in an election with four
candidates in an attempt to make the Vice-Presidential candidate for
one of the losinng parties President.  (It involved throwing the
Presidential election into the House of Representives, with none of
the--constitutionally three top--candidates having a majority, while
the Vice-President was elected by the Senate.)

   Under the current rules, the Electorial College votes separately
for President and Vice-President.  (Although they may not vote for
both a President and Vice-President from the same state that they
represent.  So parties never nominate a President and Vice-President
from the same state.--It could matter.)

   Also, although parties were non-existant as such when John Adams
was elected President the first time, he was considered of a different
party than his Vice-President Thomas Jefferson by the time their terms
expired March 4, 1801--a few months into the nineteeth century.

Get the alt.security.pgp, sci.crypt, RSA FAQ and others from
rtfm.mit.edu.  Or read this newsgroup or others for a few weeks
as they are posted often.  The latest version (and the only legal
one in North America) is v2.6 and is available at many sites
including the original MIT one, the only one off-hand is
ftp.wimsey.com.  Good luck.  Also read the doc's that come with
PGP - they are an excellent introduction to cryptography.

Let's see...  There are 2^16 possible checksums, and 2^80
possible session keys, so one gets 2^64 possible session keys
per checksum/unit-id pair, on average.  Even assuming that there
is a technique much easier than brute force for selecting
session keys which match the checksum (for a given, possibly
fake, unit-id), having to test the 2^64 potential session keys
is still quite a chore.

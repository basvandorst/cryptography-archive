If you have studied the specific claims of the patent and think the
DSS infringes, please post technical details, I'm interested to see
them.  But Bidzos saying that it infringes is not any reason to
think that it actually infringes.  Bidzos thinks that *all* forms
of public key cryptography infringe the Diffie-Hellman and related
patents, but no patent lawyer I've ever spoken to thinks this claim
has any merit.

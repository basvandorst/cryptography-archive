So long as your passphrase is kept inscribed only on your brain, yes. The
secret key is itself encrypted, using IDEA, with an MD5 (message digest)
hash of your passphrase as the key. So providing that your passphrase is
not compromised, and is not too easy to guess by a dictionary attack or
suchlike, you'd be safe.

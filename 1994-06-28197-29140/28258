It is the other way around. The plugboard settings were pretty much known.
The Germans didn't change them as frequently as they did the rotor
settings. The *trick* part was the Germans only used a handful of possible
rotor wirings, so it was possible to exhaustively test them all.

I have a bunch of decrypted messages, and there are certain words that
appear in almost every message, some in the exact same place. This made
cribbing for text much easier than it should have been.

Plugboard wiring did not change on a daily basis. The hard part was
determining which rotors were used, and what the rotor settings were. In
some cases, the rotor settings changed more than once a day. Multiply this
by the number of different nets, and the fact that the message had limited
lifetime of usefulness, and that was where the problem was.

No. See above.

I think you are trivializing the quantity of work involved. It was not
simple, nor was it a snap to solve the Enigma. For example, The plugboard
wiring alone was capable of producing 532985208200576 possible
combinations. This is not simple substitution. To trivialize this process,
does a disservice to the people that labored long hours trying to solve
these problems. It was and still is, quite difficult.

The Enigma was a reasonably sound machine for its time. It is hard to
solve, and even today there are probably only a handful of organizations
that could crack messages properly encrypted with it on a regular (useful)
basis. The problem was how the Germans used it, which led to its being
defeated.

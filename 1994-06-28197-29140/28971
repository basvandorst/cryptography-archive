	No, they deny that Clipper has any weak keys.  They are saying
two things.  First, that the principles used in generating strong keys
are not obvious, and that revealing how the key is generated would
teach us lots we don't know now about selecting strong keys, much the
way DES taught us about secret key cryptography.

	Second, even though there is no known weakness in Skipjack,
you might as well select strong keys for it.  What those strong keys
would be, I'm not sure, and the NSA may just be tossing out a red
herring by refering to 'cryptographic principles about generating good
keys.'

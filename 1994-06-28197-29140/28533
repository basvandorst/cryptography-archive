Someone has supplied the solution to the sample Enigma message that
originally appeared in the Oct. 1983 issue of Cryptologia. As I pointed
out, there were some questions about the plugboard settings.
The correct plugboard settings are:
	tb, sy, dh, lr, cz, gk
 
Even so, the settings cause about 18 typos. What follows below is
the cleaned up text with punctuation restored.

Hello,

According to the FAQ,

 "A cryptosystem or cipher system is a method of disguising messages so
  that only certain people can see through the disguise. Cryptography is
  the art of creating and using cryptosystems. Cryptanalysis is the art
  of breaking cryptosystems---seeing through the disguise even when
  you're not supposed to be able to. Cryptology is the study of both
  cryptography and cryptanalysis."


I know "Applied Cryptography", by B. Schneier has source code
and algorithms for "cryptography", but does the book have
"cryptanalysis" (as defined above) algorithms as well?


Thanks,

Allen

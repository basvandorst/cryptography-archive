Ha! My super-scientific brain sees right through your SUPER DUPER
UNBREAKABLE CYPHERTEXT!
You are right-handed, typing on a standard U.S. keyboard...and you are are
typing gibberish - and not very talented gibberish, I might add. If only
you had used a Dvorak keyboard, I might have been fooled.

Seriously, folks, have fun with Bebak's challenge - personally, I recall
Bebak's *previous* 15 minutes of fame, when he posted a newbie question to
half the newsgroups in existence (TWICE) before his account was burnt down
by an angry mob of villagers. Creative guy, Bebak.

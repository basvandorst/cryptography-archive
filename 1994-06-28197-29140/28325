If you suspect that the answer to your querie is in the FAQ, why
do you post here of all places instead of alt.security.pgp?  The
FAQ's can be found at rtfm.mit.edu or wait a couple of weeks
they're posted pretty regularly in sci.crypt, alt.security.pgp
and news.answers.  Failing that I'll gladly mail you them.  Good
luck!

About your question, I've thought of similar schemes too.  My
idea was if you have a terminal program that used "drivers" of a
sort to handle different terminal emulations, you could write a
special driver that would handle encryption.  Thus, your
terminal program would never know the difference.  I don't know
how practical this is however.  I don't think that PGP would
adapt very well to the situation.  Best to start from scratch
with the RSA & IDEA (if that's what you want to use ) routines 
and go from there.

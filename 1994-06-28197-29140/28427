Reginald gets huffy:
: Sadly, I have received no response from the net on the subject of the
: DSS/DSA patent situation.
: ...
: Oh well, perhaps this message will
: prompt someone to shed some insight into the current royalty/patent
: situation with the Digital Signature Standard/Algorithm.

Reginald, if no-one is answering your posts perhaps the
fault lies with your posts and not the people who don't
answer.

Off the top of my head I could suggest the following reasons:

1) You post some right garbage at times.
2) Anyone who always puts an exclamation mark and a smiley
   after his name every time he posts can't expect to be
   taken seriously.
3) You work for Apple and a lot of people on the net harbor
   a strong dislike of Apple, for one reason or another,
   to the extent that they'd go out of their way not to
   assist any Apple projects.

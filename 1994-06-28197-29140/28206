Does anybody have an update on crypto IP efforts?  I've
heard there are several commercial products, including
weakened U.S. DES versions from Semaphore Technologies,
Motorola, Hughes, and UUNET technologies.  Also, some
higher quality foreign versions.  How many of these products
interoperate across vendors?  Are there any public domain
versions available or in the works?  Any emerging standards,
so that if I wrote my own system it could interoperate with
other crypto IP based clients and servers?

thanks,
Jim Hart

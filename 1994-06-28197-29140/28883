I don't think that's a good test for security.
It's called security through obscurity and seldomly works well.
A encrytion is made safe by keeping the key secret not the algorithm. The
best way to check the security of your system is to post a small outline
of the used algorithm. Most probably someone will be able to tell
whether a similar system has ever been used and cracked.
If your encryption system can be cracked after you have compromised
the algorithm it's definetly NOT SECURE.

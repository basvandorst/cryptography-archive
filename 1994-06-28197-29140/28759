We are talking about the originators of the LEAF/EES scheme.  We
can assume that they know how to decrypt the session key from the
LEAF.  They disassemble the transmitted LEAF, attempting decryption of the
Unit Key encrypted Session key with every Unit Key gleaned from
the escrow data bases.

They get to try the transmitted LEAF with each candidate decrypted
session key, until the get 1) the check word in the LEAF, which 
uses out of band knowledge of the session key, and the IV to agree
that the LEAF used the session key, and 2) decrypted data they like,
which should be detectable digitally from in band signaling from the
vocoder. 

There is no requirement that a LEAF be generated, they get to test
against the transmitted LEAF.  

With the current number of Unit IDs/Unit Keys under 30,000.  It would
take somewhere between 25 and 50 minutes with a single piece of 
equipment (50-100 msec per attempt).

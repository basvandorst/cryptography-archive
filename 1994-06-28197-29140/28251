         Even worse, Micali is claiming that his patent on fair cryptosystems
         (#5,276,737) covers Clipper as well.  In the Wall Street Journal (May
         31, 1994, p. B6):

             Mr Micali, whose patent was issued in January, says his patent
             covers the concept of breaking an encryption key into multiple
             parts that are guaranteed to work, and are held by escrow
             agents.

         It seems to me that Clipper does not guarantee that the multiple parts
         will work in anywhere near the same way as his scheme does (see my boo
k
         for details); Clipper is simply a secret splitting scheme.  On the
         other hand, Micali filed his patent application in Apr 92, a full
         year before Clipper became public.

I think Micali has a good case.  In patent law, the claims are vital.
Exactly what it is that you're claiming is new is described in the claims;
something infringes if it includes all of the elements of any one claim.
Here's claim 15 of that patent:

            15. A method, using a cryptosystem, for enabling a
        predetermined entity to monitor communications of users
        suspected of unlawful activities while protecting the privacy
        of law-abiding users, wherein a group of users has a secret
        key, comprising the steps of:

         breaking the secret key into shares;

         providing trustees pieces of information that include shares
         of the secret key; and

         upon a predetermined request, having the trustees reveal the
         shares of the secret key of a user suspected of unlawful
         activity to enable the entity to reconstruct the secret key
         and monitor communications to the suspect user.

Sure sounds like Clipper to me...  (Claims 1-14 deal with Micali's
major stuff, the ``fair'' public-key based systems.)

If Micali's claim holds up, it provides folks with a whole new
weapon against obnoxious cryptographic protocols -- build 'em first,
patent 'em, and *don't* license them to the government...  (Of course,
since the U.S. uses a ``first to invent'' standard, they could defeat
that by opening up secret NSA archives to show that they really had
it first...)

Btw -- I found the patent online via WWW; see http://town.hall.org/
and do the obvious.  If you want just that single patent, go to
ftp://ftp.town.hall.org/patent/data1/05276/05276737, or do the obvious
ftp.

You're uh, er, um, full of mirth, Elias. One of the main contributions I
made via the government is doing the systems analysis and design that
created the National Cancer Institute Center at Frederick, Maryland. This
Government-owned, contractor operated research lab has made major
contributions to the war on cancer.

The NIH is full of dedicated public servants, including some Nobel types,
doing breakthrough work in preventing and curing diseases, including some
the private sector won't touch because there isn't a buck in it, or because
the research funds needed are too large for an individual company and they
can't capture the benefits of any successes.

So are most government departments. A tiny minority of those in the
government, much less than 1 percent, are politicians, and most of the
things you don't like about government are as a direct response to the
urgings of the people, or some subgroup of the people.

Before you continue spouting ignorance, I suggest a good course in civics,
in which you find out exactly what the government IS, and what it does,
would be helpful.

It would also be useful if you dropped the monumental arrogance behind any
notion that "the people" want everything you want and thus the government is
some rogue elephant, doing its own will. Though there have been a few
incidents, and in this country they always make the papers and people
eventually go to jail or have careers ruined, in terms of the good
government does they are a tiny proportion.

In most other coutries someone as powerful as Rostankowski would never be
touched. Here, he gets indicted. You should kiss the ground of this country,
you self-important egotist.

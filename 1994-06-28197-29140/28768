For a good book on GSM you should try "The GSM System for Mobile
Communication" by Mouly & Patet (ISBN 2-9507190-0-7). A short
summary from pp 480-2 follows.

The A5 algorithm takes a 22 bit frame number and a 64 bit key as
input to produce two 114 bit chiphering sequence that is XORed with
the 114 bit data bursts of the uplink and downlink directions. 
Changing the frame number creates a cycle somewhat shorter than 3.5
hours.

"The level of protection offered by A5 is determined by the complexity
of the reverse calculation, i.e., the computation of the [64 bit key]
knowing two 114-bits ciphering sequences and the frame number."

You misunderstand -- in the scenario I outlined above it was
not _incompetence_ but *malice* that is proposed as the source
of the weak checksum.  I.e. that the checksum was _designed_ to
be weak so that the brute-force keyspace would be reduced.

Also, I'm not saying it is or isn't; I was just explaining
someone else's earlier posting about how the checksum _might_
leak 16 bits of session key.  Until the LEAF algorithm is
public we can't be sure.

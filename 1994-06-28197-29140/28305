"certainly... might be"???

In fact, if P != NP then NP-NPC-P _is_ non-empty.  The proof isn't
difficult (hint: take an NP-complete set, and split it into two
subsets neither of which is NP-complete.  The "splitting machine"
can run in linear time.)

Precisely.

It was proven long ago; I don't remember who by.

Working for the largest Bank in South Africa as a Computer Security 
Consultant I can give you some viewpoints of my own and how it is 
implemented locally.

We have three basic services:

1) TONI - which is BANKING BY PHONE use a tone dial or a tone generator.
2) AutoBel - which is Banking from home going through a service provider 
namely BelTel. Beltel is a X.400 and mailbox and Gateway providers to 
many companies.
3) CATS - a service provided to corporate users which have direct access 
to an application on the host (mainframe).

The first two are customers with relatively low volume and value 
transactions. These lines are normal 'BundesPost' lines which are either 
analog or digital.

CATS is used with a synchronous modem with a proprietary scrambling 
chipset. Encryption forced on from the host side with the primary 
handshake.

Another project is doing R&D on smartcard usage with X.21 or X.24 line 
encryption using a locally developed product.

It only depends on the ALE (Annual Loss Expectancy) the determine the 
controls that would be put in place. Lines could be tapped, but the 
value of the fraud/theft would be low. I place this in the same category 
as walking from the bank and getting robbed. YOU can place the controls 
to minimise the risks.

	Just wondering, if you "just" need a large number of random values
why don't you just hook up a output of a stereo reviever to a soundblaster
input and record yourself. . .oh let's say two or three minutes of static.  At
a recording speed of 44.1khz with 16 bits per sampling thats over 800k/min.
And if you really needed greater randomness cut the file in half do a position
shift of the second part with the values of the first half.  Or maybe record
another section of static on another static filled channel and XOR the bits
together. . .

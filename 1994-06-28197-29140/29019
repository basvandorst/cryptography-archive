	Does any body know of a public domain program that simply asks 
for the code key ( like when you use a one-time pad) and then input the 
plaintext either from a file or the keyboard and get the code out, thus 
saving the burdonsome task of using the Vigenere table and getting 
crosseyed in the process? Obviously the decryption would work the same way.
	The would not be a coding algorythum per se, just automating the 
process of using the Vigenere table.
	Please reply by e-mail or this posting...Thankr

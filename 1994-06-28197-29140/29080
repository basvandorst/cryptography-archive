	I am afraid that my lack of knowledge about cyphers may have 
complicated the question. Let me start from a new direction.
	I have become interested in the Vingerere code and that code as I 
understand it uses a "key" to shift each of the letters of the plaintext. 
The problem is that you can go a little blind using the chart and I was 
looking for a program that simply took the "key" shifted letters and gave 
you out the results of the shift when you put in the plaintext.
	I hope I didn't make things worse...
Thanks for any and all help to this newbee.

Sadly, I have received no response from the net on the subject of the
DSS/DSA patent situation. I'm still in the dark about whether DSS is going
to be royalty-free or whether PKP will somehow control this as well.

It seems incredible, but somehow important issues like this don't generate
any activity, while my newsreader is full of talk.politics.whatever and
alt.fan.whomever posted to sci.crypt. Oh well, perhaps this message will
prompt someone to shed some insight into the current royalty/patent
situation with the Digital Signature Standard/Algorithm.

Regards,
Reginald Braithwaite-Lee !:-)

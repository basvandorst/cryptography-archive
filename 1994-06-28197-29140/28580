Actually, it seems to me that relying on a secret family key is just about
as stupid as using the 16-bit checksum in the first place. Anybody really
believe that the family keys are going to remain secret for any length of
time? How long until there's a widely available database of family keys on
the 'net?

Once you have the LEAF unencrypted--at no cost--it should be much, much
easier to break the encrypted session key than the original message.
Especially since Clipper is already leaking like a sieve. Who knows how
much else of the "secret" algorithm will be known by then?

This is security?

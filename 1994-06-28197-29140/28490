I'm glad it makes you happy to have caught someone with your `clever'
little scheme (I suspect you're taking credit after the fact, but no
matter), because I suspect people will be falling over themselves to join
Matthew in your kill-file.  The reason being that the more of us there are
in your kill-file the fewer your posts when we point out what an idiot you
are.

At last, a compromise acceptable to all.  David kill-files the entire net so
doesn't see their criticisms of him and doesn't get upset.  Because David
does not see posts critical of him he cannot respond and thereby fan the
flames.  Newbies get to see people pointing out why David is such a moron
and learn not to trust a word he says.  Best of all, usenet traffic drops
10%.

You know it makes sense - insult Sternlight NOW.

]Well given the family key, one would expect it possible to feed that into
]a clip chip and make "roll your own" acceptable LEAFs very easy.

To do that, you'd need the family key (ask your Big Brother for it :-),
and access to the SkipJack algorithm (you can probably get your
Clipper chip to do it that part for you if you ask nicely),
and also the details of LEAF Creation Method 1, which is the algorithm
used to create the LEAFs.  SkipJack and LCM1 are both classified,
probably because of the risk of a stolen family key.
LCM1 is supposedly fairly simple, like encrypting a constant or the
chipid with the session key, but you do need to know it.

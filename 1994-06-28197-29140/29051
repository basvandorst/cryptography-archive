	One response I got, which was totally off the mark was from a person who
	decrypted wrongly my massage using neural net work.  This made me wonder
	that if the computer neural networks are susceptible to "Freudian Slip"
	based on their training.  

Read what he said below:

	Now, I know what you want to say.  You will deny that I've got the answer.
	If so, what prove do you have?  If you cannot give acceptable proof that
	the following is not the answer, then the net will consider the problem
	solved, and your crypting engine cracked.  One acceptable proof, if you
	need to give one, is to show us your algorithm.

He's taking the piss out of you you bloody idiot.  The 'neural net output'
is the contents of his cookie file...

	Dynamic Ram: a lothario of the pasture.

Oh wait a minute - I get it - you're in this together - the pair of
you are trolling, right?  So is it alt.syntax.tactical or are you
in with those kibo kooks?

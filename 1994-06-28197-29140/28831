The session keys are generated by the user, and fed to the chip,
so the quality of the session keys depends on your phone set or whatever.
Clipper doesn't control that, though Capstone gives you some
key-exchange protocol support.

If the NSA felt like including a backdoor in the chip, they could do
something like have the *two* different algorithms, depending on the key;
1/256 of the keys (matching some checksum) could use a secure algorithm,
and the other 255/256 could use an easily cracked one, (such as
Skipjack with 70 of the key bits set or something like that)
allowing them to tap *most* of the non-government calls while letting
them have a 2**72 keyspace of good keys.  Or the chip could have a
lead whose undocumented function is to go into secure mode, or the
chip could accept a second password if the first password entered
matches the secret government password, allowing easy tapping of all
phones except those with the real secret password.  There's no way to know.
But assuming the algorithm doesn't play games, and they really use the
session key you hand it, session keys aren't the trick.

Besides, the function used to set the chip-unique wiretap keys is classified,
and *it* may be very non-random.  That would be lots more useful for them.

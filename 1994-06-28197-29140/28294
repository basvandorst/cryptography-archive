Today's (6/2/94) New York Times has an article about a flaw in Clipper.  
The flaw in it seems like the many obvious ones discussed often in Sci.crypt 
and similar to a paper I presented to the Security and Privacy Advisory 
Board a year ago.  

Is what is being talked about new work? Is it a non-obvious way to 
subvert the checksum?

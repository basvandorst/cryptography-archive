Question 1: Would it be easy to imbed a backdoor in a secret algorithm?

Answer 1: Yes.  Trivial--it's possible to make the backdoor even more secure
than a front-door attack, so it WON'T be discovered without inside knowlege.

Question 2: Given the government's track record, is there any reason to
assume that Clipper does not have other backdoors besides the LEAF? (note
that Leafblower-damaged LEAFs are easy to detect).

We'll cross that bridge when we come to it.

A statement that Clipper isn't bugged would in fact mean nearly nothing; draw
the matrix of "Is clipper bugged" and "Do they say so".  The matrix would
read "1 0 / 1-epsilon epsilon".  Thus, the government's statement that Clipper
is not bugged bears very little weight on the probability that it is.

Never happen.

More likely the FDA, but never happen in any event.

Sure there is.  Make the algoritm public and eliminate export restrictions
and you'll satisfy just about everyone.  Make the rationale behind the
algorithm public and even the sticklers would probably come 'round.

Glad you can keep a happy face given that Orwell was only ten years early...

Some problems:
  * How to map a message into an instance of the TS problem.
  * How to decode a permuted (encrypted) instance.
  * Given that KNAPSACK is also an NP-complete problem, and
    knapsack-based cryptosystems have been broken due to the
    fact that knapsacks amenable to cryptography tend to have
    sufficient structure to render them solvable, what assurance
    do you have that the class of TS problems being used are "hard"
    instances?

(P.S. in a similar vein I once sketched a Hamiltonian Graph based
crypto system, but it suffers from the last problem mentioned
above, I haven't proved that my decryption plan actually works, and
it also has a horrendous data-expansion factor on encryption.)

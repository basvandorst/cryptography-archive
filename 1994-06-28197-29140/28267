Ah.  I see: a trans-Atlantic cultural problem.

A Vice President is *supposed* to be a characterless potato[e].  It
prevents him distracting attention from the Prexy, and avoids wasting
the time of someone with actual qualifications, in a job whose whole
description is "wait around for four years for the boss to die."

I can see how the recent Clinton-Clinton-Gore ticket could have
confused you, but the "characterless potato[e]" description is the one
that's actually written into the Constitution.

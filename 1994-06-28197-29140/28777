Just a minor nit-pick --- for very small files, it is possible (and in
fact appears to be likely) that the probability changes dramatically.
To take the simplest case, assume a one-byte file.  There are 256
possible one-byte files, and it is entirely conceivable that MD5
produces a unique hash for each one.  If that is the case (I've never
run MD5 against all such files, so I don't know for sure), the
probability that two one-byte file have the same MD5 hash is 0.

But for "reasonable" file sizes (i.e., significantly greater than
16 bytes), assuming claims of MD5 are true, then the odds hold for
any size file.

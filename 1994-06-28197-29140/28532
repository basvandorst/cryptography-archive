What if one were to buy two Clipperphones and then put phone #1's LEAFs in
front of phone #2's sessions?  The IV would be junk, but that should only
cause a few bytes to be glitched.  The feds could get the wiretap info from
phone #1 and it would LOOK okay, but it wouldn't tell them anything about
phone #2.  Note that one would have to use care that no phone #2 LEAF escaped
since the feds could use the phone's serial number to crack all coversations
from phone #2--even ones without a valid LEAF.

Of course, this is all assuming the feds even NEED the LEAF...

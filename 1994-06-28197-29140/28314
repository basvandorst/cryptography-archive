Matt Blaze of AT&T discovered a flaw in the LEAF (Law Enforcement
Access Field) process that allows a bogus LEAF number to be generated,
one which passes the checksum tests but is useless in decrypting the
communication. Thus, users could generate ostensibly valid LEAF
numbers but still keep their communications secure from the NSA.

The NYT article by John Markoff has a nice sidebar illustration which
makes the discovery more understandable. Exact details are circulating
in a paper which some of my colleagues have seen (I have not).

This is just another stumble-bum episode. Few of the "terrorists and
drug lords" I know (g) were planning to use the Clipper system, and
now the whole process is even more of a useless system. (Fortunately
for us.)

"Sink Clipper!" is about to become the past tense.

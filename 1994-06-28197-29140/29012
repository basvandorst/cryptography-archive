If RSA would be an ideal system, maybe you should not rule
out using it.

Being patented doesn't mean you can't use it, it just
means in general that you need a licence/permission
from the patent holders to do so.

If your intended use is non-commercial you may be able
to use the RSAREF library at no cost. If it is a
commercial application you may have to pay something, but
you won't know how much or whether such cost is within
your budget if you don't ask.

Talk to PKP or RSADSI directly and find out.

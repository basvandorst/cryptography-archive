On the Newton, 'Crypt' is an application which performs IDEA-based password
encryption, written by Charles Vollum. 'nCrypt' is also an application
which performs password encryption on the Newton, written by myself and
Andrew Bartle.

Crypt encrypts text only, and uses the 'clipboard'. Thus you can only
encrypt as much text as you can select.

nCrypt directly encrypts notes, names, and many other Newton objects. In
addition to encrypting text, nCrypt can directly encrypt objects, thus it
can capture styles, drawings, and other information.

One thing in Crypt's favour is that source code comes with the application,
and the free version implements the full 128 bit keys. (I believe the
password conversion process does not use hashing, and may be somewhat
weakened as a result). nCrypt does not come with source code (though a
technical note is being prepared), and keys are limited to 40 bits until
you register (provided you are a US or Canadian resident). SHA-based
hashing is used for passphrases.

Please contact me if you would like a copy of nCrypt.

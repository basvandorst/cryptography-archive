In looking over material on the Enigma, I noticed that the M-4 Engima
machine had numbers on the top row of keys, plus 0 on the P in the
lower left-hand corner. I wonder if that's the origin of some codes
that use the top row of the qwerty keyboard for 1-0..... still
in use today.
	ps...those still looking for Kahn's ``Seizing the Engima''
can get it for $5.95 from Edward R. Hamilton, Falls Village Ct.

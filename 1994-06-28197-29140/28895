You might find it instructive to take a look at:

	Spycatcher		by Peter Wright, and
	The Perfect Spy		by John Le Carre

Not much a historical example, that last one, but it does have
the germ of what you're looking for.

Can you explain a little of the Zendian Problem?  I know of it
only from APP's catalog, and would really like to hear more
about it.

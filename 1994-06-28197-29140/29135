If you might be willing to end up in court, you could also 
consider asking an attorney how strong RSA's
legal position really is--I've gotten the impression that
no algorithm patent has been tested in a U.S. appeals court except
where many side issues existed. Jury decisions don't set the
same kind of precedent, since the jury doesn't publish its
reasons for the decision. No one can be sure which cases are
affected by the jury's reasoning. Needless to say, I'm not a
lawyer, and this stuff is complicated.

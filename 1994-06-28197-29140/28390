If someone reverse-engineers Skipjack and publishes it, won't the feds show
up and take you in because it's supposedly classified? Maybe all this is
designed to scare people away from using the algorithm - imagine the legal
nightmare because your product uses something which maybe classified and maybe
the subject of "secret" patents (if such a thing can legally exist). 

If we have any patent lawyers out there, would you give us an opinion on the
validity of such an arrangement. I wonder if other countries would be obliged
to honour the arrangement?

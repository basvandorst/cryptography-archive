I'm not sure this is right. The blaze attack changes both the encrypted
session key and the serial number (ie 112 bits) All of the checksum
info could be on the serial number. 
For an unblown clipper chip, the arguement also does not work. Consider
the following stupid checksum- take the last 16 bits of the encrypted
session key and copy it inot the checksum. The checksum obviously
depencs on the session key, but it gives you absolutely no more
information than does the encrypted key itself. It make it no easier to
break the encrypted key than before. Another stupid checksum would be to
take the last 16 bits of the unencrypted key. This clearly does make the
information needed to get the whole key smaller by 16 bits. Thus, the
amount of information that the checksum provides something between 0
bits and 16 bits. It all depends on the quality of the checksum.

Remember that the 80 bits of the encrypted key depend in a one to one
way on the session key. According to the arguement this should mean that
you have 80 bits of information about the key. Maybe you do, but it is
rather useless. Furhtermore, each byte of the message itself depends on
the session key, and if you for some reason you know the plaintext, it
depends on the session key alone. You thus have far far more than 80
bits of information about the session key. Unfortunately, all that
information does you no good if the encryption process is any good.

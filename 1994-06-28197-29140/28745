If the contention that DES is *NOT* a "group" cipher is true, and that seems
to be the case from what I've read, then there is no composite key that will
undo KEY1 and give you the effect of KEY2 while bypassing the decryption
step.  You could encrypt the KEY1 ciphertext with KEY2 of course, but it
would still need to be decrypted with BOTH keys in order to restore the
plain text.

May I presume from the question that you're wanting to do this on a
NON-secure computer?

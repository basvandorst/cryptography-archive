Here's a non-apocryphal story.

10 or 15 years ago, my parents received a letter addressed to me from the
International Court of the Hague.  The manila envelope looked as if it had
been through a lot of folding, refolding, crumpling.  Postmark seemed legit.
Inside was an old chess scorebook of mine from 1976 or thereabouts, and a
letter.

The letter said that the scorebook was being sent back to me since I'd
probably like to have it back, as part of a cleaning out of evidence from
a case between the US and the USSR (or was it Bulgaria?  I forget), where
the US accused the USSR of spreading junk evidence of spying in the US.

My chess scorebook had been found in the Los Angeles apartment of a Russian
suspected of spying.  The FBI thought it contained code, but after sending
it to the Hague, FIDE, the international chess federation whose main office
is in the Hague, confirmed that it contained only algebraic chess notation,
not used very much at that time in the US.

Russian algebraic was a big fad then too; my scorebook used English.

Cheers,
Toni (Wuersch)

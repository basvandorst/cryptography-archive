Anyone know of a package which I could take a hostid, hostname, and
expiration date and encode them using a key and give a short generated
ascii encrypted key which decrypted would produce the hostid, hostname 
and expirationd date?

Anyone already come up with a tool/utility for this?

(Please send replies/followups to zen@cns.cscns.com; I will post summary)

Thanks.

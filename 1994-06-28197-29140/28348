Subject: Bruce Schneier's Applied

P>For my birthday (March 6), I recieved a 1994 copy of Applied
 >Cryptography.  It matches the ISBN number, and the copyright is 1994.
 >-> 1.: Does anybody already have this "new" book?

        About this book ...

        IF YOU ALREADY DON'T HAVE IT - GO AND GET IT NOW !

        I think it is a very throughout book (must admit
        haven't read it totally yet) (must admit I am quite
        proud of myself if I am going to understand 70%)
        So I am a rookie in this area and have gone
        through books. I have the basic understanding
        of this crypto stuff but then I wanted some more.
        First book was interesting - first three pages
        contained more clear text than rest of the book.
        Needless to say that book is nice on the self
        but no real use.

        I bought Applied Cryptography about week ago ... so far three
        of my
        friends have already ordered it .. by the
        end of this month ...

        I hope I can find another good book after
        I have digested this one.

        ******************  Nice work Bruce !  *******************


        Now about this companion diskettes...I want them badly.
        But I am in Finland which is not part of the USA though
        we are not part of the Russia either(wait a sec I have a glance
        out of the window ...). If I understand right the whole
        lot could be printed out on the paper and then sending it
        outside
        of the USA would not be a problem - or ?

        If somebody has this diskette ... could he maybe drop a
        message to me so that I really know what I am missing
        because of this <censored> law. And who knows maybe I
        happed to need a second copy of this book as a backup.

This is not correct. The Germans changed the plugboard settings when
they changed the rotor settings. The German army had one key
setting procedure that was introduced towards the end of the war (1944?)
which would change the rotor order twice during the day. If I remember
right that rotor order change took place at 9:00 and 16:00 German
local time. When these changes happened the plugboard settings were not
changed, but this is the only case I know about. All the other key
setting sheets I have found always gave a new plugboard setting.

I keep looking for analysis books all the time and so far
I can say that there are only two books I've found on cryptanalysis
that I like.

1)	Elementary Cryptanalysis by Abraham Sinkov, 1966.
	This book is very mathematical in its treatment of
	the ciphers covered, including analysis.  It covers
	monoalphabetic, polyalphabetic, hill and transposition
	ciphers.

2)	Cryptanalysis for Microcomputers by Caxton C. Foster,
	1982.  This book covers almost all of the 'classical'
	methods(pre-WWII) by hand and by basic programs.
	Because of its printing date this book assumes small
	memory size and no disk access.

Unfortunately, I have not seen a good book on analysis of
modern or algebraic methods.  The only places that I have found
any information on solving LSR or LFSR are in magazines.

Could someone please expand on this book list?  Are there some
more up-to-date books on cryptanalysis?  How about a list of
magazines that are useful?

Patent secrecy orders are actually more common then you'd suppose.
The PTO has a whole list of things that get made secret if you take
the trouble to patent them. The secrecy order *IS NOT THE SAME* as
the national security classification such as secret and top secrect.
Its a different category of animal. There's a whole history of
people getting their inventions ordered secret by PTO and some have
fought it successfully while others have not. One case was reversed
because the wrong level of offical at one of the reviewing agencies
signed the agencies response. Tossed out by a procedural error!
The famous case is when the government decared a cipher machine to be secret
in the 1920's only to have the navy secrectly make them and not pay a dime 
to the inventor.The inventor was *very* upset  when he found out 
many years later. No compensation was every paid.  I don't
know why skipjack's patent would be invalidated if the secrecy order
somehow got broken. Reverse engineering it would not violate the
original order I think because it isusually aimed at the designer
and anyone who has helped/viewed/discussed the design prior to submission.
And, the technology could also be DoD Secret as well as PTO secret!

But that gets into a real can of worms because I assume the reverse 
engineer did not entere into any confidentiality agreements with the 
government.

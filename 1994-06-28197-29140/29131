I was just reading Applied Crypto last nite about MMB, a 128 bit block
algorithm using 32 bit math.  The Reference is "Block Ciphers Based on 
Modular Arithmatic" by J. Deamen, R. Goaerts, and J. Vandewalle.  Is 
their article on line or can someone send me their e-mail address?

Also, in the errata, Bruce says that MMB has been broken.  Could someone
please send me a pointer to where that article might be on line and/or
e-mail addresses of the authors?  Thanks!!  

Patience, persistence, truth,
Dr. mike

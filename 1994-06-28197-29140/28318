PN> What's this nCrypt? What algorithm 
PN> does it use?

nCrypt Light is a password protection app for Newton which uses an MDC
variant called "Stop & Go". We are working on a full public key app for
Newton as well, which will probably be commerical rather than freeware.

A technical note detailing the Stop & Go algorithm will appear shortly: the
algorithm is slightly moot,as nCrypt allows drop-in algorithms. The Stop &
Go algorithm was included because it is based on Hash functions, and
re-using the existing hash function was smore space-efficient than having
one algorithm for hashing passwords and another for encryption.

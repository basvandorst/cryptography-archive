NIST's position is that DSS/DSA/SHA etc. does not infringe on any PKP 
patents. PKP's position is they do. But for a variety of legal and 
technical reasons, PKP isn't about to sue the government for 
infringement. NIST says DSS is royalty-free. But commercial users know 
they're likely to be sued if they use it. The upshot: DSS is in about the 
same legal limbo as PGP prior to 2.6, with the governemnt's sponsorship 
offering no real safe harbor to private users, of which there aren't 
likely to be any.

Strange request indeed.  Solicitation of a felony at best; entrapment
at worst.  Given that the NSA is so anxious for victims, I hope that
no one in the net is so foolish as to take you up on this request.

Given that you can simply scan the programs in, such a request is
either very naive, or highly suspect.

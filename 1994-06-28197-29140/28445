In article <Cqs9y1.By9@ulysses.homer.att.com>, smb@research.att.com (Steven
Bellovin) discussed Matt Blaze's procedure to foil the key escrow 
provision of Clipper by producing messages that have usable encryption
with bogus LEAF fields.

One simple way to work-around this problem would be for Clipper to
transmit multiple copies of the LEAF field (scattered throughout the
message). These could easily (?) be hidden within the datastream. (This
would easily be detectable if the entire algorithm were to be published,
of course.)

I have no idea whether Clipper actually transmits multiple LEAF fields.

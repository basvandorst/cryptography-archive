So what?  If the patent application(s) pre-date the publication, then it may
be prior publication but it is not prior "art".

A patent protects you for N years from the issuance of the patent, not
from date of invention or date of application.  Due to arguments with
the patent office, amendments to patent applications, etc., patent
issuance can be delayed almost indefinitely.  And patent applications
are secret until the patent issues.  In the legal profession, this
sort of thing is called a submarine patent.  (Just crusing along below
the surface and waiting to pop up...)

Patent law has always been like this in the US.  Drug companies
particularly like it as they can mkae more by having their molecule
protected for, say, from 5 to 22 years after invention, rather than 0
to 17.

When you say "asks for the code key", do you mean on a floppy disk, or what?
Don't forget that with that type of crypto, the "key" needs to be as long as
what's being encrypted, which would represent a LOT of typing for a long
message, plus introduce the possibility of errors due to typos.

If the table is in machine readable form, then I'd suggest a floppy disk, or
something else that can be removed from the computer and securely locked up
or hidden somewhere safe when not in use.

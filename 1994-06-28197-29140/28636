     True; I'm suggesting complicating an idea without proof it
becomes more random, which is bad.

     What you really want is something that can be shown to be
formally chaotic, so that you're looking at amplified quantum noise.
Turbulence can have that property, and I gather that's how you're
approaching the problem.

      Yes.  You have to make sure you're amplifying the noise, not
filtering it.

      This is going to be really tough to do right over a broad range of
disk controllers.

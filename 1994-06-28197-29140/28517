Frode, thanks for the other information. It has solved many loose
ends and its all making sense now. (I tried to send you email, but
there are local UUCP problems preventing this right now).   :-(

Now another point:

I need further clarification on the "Double
advancement anomoly" of the middle wheel (3 rotors). Reading
[Frode's] description of this, I am led to believe that the middle rotor
advances twice (under the right conditions of the middle+rightmost rotor)
with a SINGLE keystroke.  Is this correct?  Frode?

Or, does it instead, advance middle and rightmost rotor on the FIRST
keystroke, then advance the middle rotor ONCE MORE on the FOLLOWING
keystroke? (the rightmost rotor having notched itself for this for the
middle rotor)  I hope I'm not to vague on this point.

I can see this double advancement occuring in two stages
being easier to implement with the mechanical arrangement that
I am able to ferret out of the side view diagram in David Kahn's
"Seizing the Enigma" (this book seems to have better pictures of the
various parts of the unit).  However, I've been wrong on a lot of
my guesses so far  :->

Does anybody know what or how to handle old PK keys for electronic 
documents that have been archived. Here's the problem: suppose you have an
electronic document server with a PK directory and you've distributed 
private parts of the PK (or let user generate them and register them with
a secure registration protocol). Now ten years go by and someone contests
one of the documents in court. The judge says: produce the document and
demonstrate the signature to the court.  You say: I only have the public
key portion (which you have carefully saved as an important business record)
but I don't have the signers private key which was privately held and
which was never available for archiving. 

(1) What can we do to demonstrate the validity of the signature at this 
    late date.

(2)  Will the judge just take a third parties word that its good?
     Say a company notary is present and checks the signatures,
     then signs with his/her notary signature that everythings OK?

(3) How is this problem being addressed with  say electronic commerce 
    systems?

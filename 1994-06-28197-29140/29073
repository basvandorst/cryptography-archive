I'm interested in any sources of info on the Clipper chip...
Legalities, technicalities, your opinions, etc...

Can I get that article from Wired, that had an interview with someone about the  
Clipper Chip, on the net?

A simple question from me:
Can't we just encrypt our data on top of Clipper?
If so, I don't see any big deal, except for maybe a degraded performance due to  
extra encryption, unless, of course, it will be illegal to use other forms of  
encryption -- which seems ridiculous..


Thanks all,

Cary

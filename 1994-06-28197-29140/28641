Subject: Odds of different messages having same MD5 signature?

I have a bunch of images that I want to use MD5-style algorithm to generate
"signatures" for the images, and be sure that modified/corrupted/different
images generate different signatures.

Given 2 equal length files, what are the odds that 2 images will generate
the same MD5 signature? Is it possible that single-byte changes will 
generate the same MD5 signature?  Is this kind of thing calculable?

Are there other good hash functions or CRC algorithms that will generate
an adequately safe checksum?    Perhaps a longer hash?  I need this to be
more reliable than the CRC mechanism that's used in Zmodem for transferring
files.

Algorithmic analysis is definitely not one of my strong points... Any 
tips appreciated.  Thanks.

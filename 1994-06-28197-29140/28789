It would be trivial to imbed a trapdoor which was more secure than the
rest of the encryption used in the chip.  And, with very few exceptions, the
NSA is pretty good about keeping secrets.

Also, it would be possible to give each chip a different "back-door" key,
and keep the list of backdoor keys in a seperate database from the "official"
databases kept by the escrow houses.  In such a case, compromised LEAF fields
would make it harder to find a chip's serial number (one might even have to
search through all issued backdoor keys) but would not in any way prevent
decryption of intercepted messages.

Given that Clipper chips' LEAF fields may be spoofed, it MUST be the case that
either [1] Clipper can be used to communicate without government wiretapping 
or [2] there exists some other backdoor.  Given the government's track record,
I doubt that they'd make publicly available a strong crypto they couldn't
break.

How does the government lose if each chip has a cryptographically "re-inforced"
back door key?  That would not affect the security of the chip with respect to
opponents who did not know the key to the individual chip, but it would render
"leaf blowing" futile.

   As was the original "potatoe" incident.  Quayle was handed a "flash
card" to use in a spelling quiz "photo op."  If I had been in Quayle
shoes, I would have torn the card in two, thrown it at the teacher,
and let forth with a ten-minute harangue about trying undercutting
authority by trying to embarrass the Vice-President in public.  Then I
would have demanded that the teacher and anyone else in on the prank
be fired.

   (Of course, I have a lot more faith in my own spelling ability than
Dan Qualye did in his, and I have never been accused of putting up
with many of the things professional politicians have to endure every
day.)

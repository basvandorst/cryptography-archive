Maybe you should have looked over in alt.security.pgp, because there's been
a discussion of something called 'voice PGP', which sounds like exactly
what you're asking about.  It's in the early stages of development, though,
and a beta test version isn't expected for several months.

Voice PGP isn't actually BBS-based, although my guess is it would be a
relatively trivial matter to adapt it to that.  It's real, genuine secure
voice communications by using two high-end PC, Mac, Unix, or other personal
computers with good sound systems and fast processors.  I gather the phone
would somehow be hooked up through the computer.  

My guess is that they're doing a thorough rewriting and reimplementation of
the algorithms rather than just adapting PGP as it sits, for the reasons
stated earlier in this thread.  The project team leader is asking for a good
Macintosh programmer to volunteer some time to port a piece of particularly
tricky code to the Mac.

The answer to this is "Depends on who you believe".

During much of the early public discussion of DSS, PKP claimed that it
infringes on Schnorr's patent, which they own.  There was much negotiation.
Therefore, when the NIST announced that they had made the standard official,
I was surprised to see that the announcement claimed that the algorithm
was not known to conflict with any patents and could be used freely --
no mention of either the controversy, Schnorr, or PKP.

I sent mail to Jim Bidzos about it, with a copy to the NIST person;
Jim wrote back saying he was surprised by it also and they were trying
to find out why the NIST said what they said, since he still
considers it infringing and has not made any free-use license with NIST.
The NIST person, of course, didn't write back.

Details are on my other machine somewhere.  While I'm no believer in
software patents, if the government is going to issue the things it's
certainly hypocritical of them to just *steal* one that it's issued
without even admitting it's doing so....

Hello,
I had the same problem two weeks ago, asking myself about buying an secure
digital phone (GSM for Europe).
I made a simple call to Motorola in Switzerland.
The digital cellular (GSM) works like this:

- On the same cellular channel (200Khz wide) you'll find 8 users.
- This 8 users are sending digital packets all 1/4,7 secs in no specific order.
- All packets are crypted with an changing code.

So the problem is clear. For the hack you need:

- A FM wide band (200Khz) scanner.
- The software you will find in the developpement lab of Motorola 8-).

The developpement of a new digital phone concept cost about 2 Million $.
But if you really want to try the crack you must use an R&S Testing Equipement.
That's the only solution for the moment. This equipement was build to test
the cellular network. The hacker will find he's pleasure for only 25000 $.

Conclusion: it's perhaps possible, if you have money to spend for the fun.

All best, Peter.

Knuth, Art of Computer Programming Vol 1 (I think ) has 
complete algorithms for doing big number arithmetic.  However, what you really 
need is modular airthmetic. Montgomery's algorithm seems to be the best 
around.  At least that is what a paper in the proceedings of Crypto 93, 
Springer Verlag reported.

   The part of the attack discovered by Blaze on the Tessera cards
that disturbs me is that it shows a 16-bit subliminal channel available
to someone who either has time to try 2**16 LEAF's at random, or
(I think, this may be wrong) for someone who has the family key.
 
   One potential use of this would be to leak 16 bits of the 80-bit
key.  This would reduce the security down to 64 bits, which is a
feasible keysearch length for a wealthy agency (NSA or its foreign
equivalents).
 
   Can anyone tell me whether or not knowledge of the internally-stored
family keys would make it possible to choose a conforming LEAF fast?
If so, this seems like an important potential weakness.

May I suggest that you find a local community college and take such a
course?  The election in November is to choose electors for each state
(and, thanks to amendment 23, the District of Columbia).  The electors
meet and vote separately for President and Vice-President.  See
Article 2 Section 1 and Amendment 12 of The Constitution of the
United States of America.

In practice, what ties the President and Vice-President together are
the agreements between the political parties and their electors.
Parties put up slates of electors who agree to vote for the candidates
select by the parties.

PGP Weakness:
	I have a question about an implementation weakness in PGP.

	Assume that someone wants to bypass the RSA Public/Private
	encryption and try to attack the IDEA algorithem directly.

	As I understand the PGP implementation...
	The IDEA algorthm is used in CFB mode.
	During encryption:
		64 random bits are encrypted.
		Then the last 16 of these bits are duplicated
		to provide an IDEA key check during decryption.
	Then, during decryption:
		These duplicated 16 bits are compaired with the last
		16 bits of the 64 random bits to check if
		the correct IDEA key was used.

	Now, to me this would seem to be a grave error in a good
	cryptosystem. Without this sort of check a cracker would
	have a much tougher time determining if he has the correct
	IDEA key.

				Thanks,
				Tom Rollins <trollins@debbie.telos.com>

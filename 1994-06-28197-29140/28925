If the checksum does not depend on the session key, then it becomes
simple to create valid rogue LEAF's.  Just save the LEAF from an
older session and use it.  The receiving Clipper will not be able
to verify that the session key encrypted in the LEAF is actually
the session key in use.  The only way for the receiving Clipper to
confirm that the LEAF contains the session key in use is for
information about that key to be contained in the LEAF where the
receiving Clipper can get to it.  The only place to do this is in
the checksum.  Remember, the receiving Clipper does not have
the unit key for the originating Clipper.

Why would the authorities bother to monitor for mal-formed LEAF's in
the first place?  Clipper chips won't accept them.  You make a Clipper
chip secure by sending false LEAFs that pass all the tests that the
receiving chip performs.  If you send mal-formed LEAFs you'll never even
get a connection.  Kinda like trying to dial your phone by caughing into
it.  At most, they would monitor the serial numbers, trying to find ones
that haven't been issued yet.

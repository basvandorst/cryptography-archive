Hi there!

I would appreciate some pointers to information that could help
me with the following problem.  The task is to design an authorization
mechanism that is equivalent to the bank-by-phone customer identification:
Given a number of existing, publicly accessible accounts, I would like
to devise a unique key for every customer to access his/her account.
I believe there are two parts to this problem:
1)  Determining the size of the key that makes a random or organized
    effort to access any of the accounts unfeasible.  I am looking for
    some "real life" examples/experiences of the ratio of possible
    combinations to valid combinations (actual accounts).
2)  A mechanism to generate this key:  What has come to my mind is
    either the use of a random number generator or, preferably,
    a good encryption of serial numbers.  Either way, I need to learn
    about algorithms to implement one such method.

If you are aware of literature discussing this or a similar issue,
I'd appreciate a reply!

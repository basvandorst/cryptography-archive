That's not quite right, because NSA is part of the government.  28 U.S.C.
sec. 1498(a) says that the only remedy against the government if they
use the patent without authorization is to sue for reasonable compensation.
This has been considered to be an exercise of the government's eminent
domain power.

Note that this means that a government agency can pretty much just go
ahead and use a patent without too much worry.  The worst that happens
is that they get caught, and then make the patent owner sue them.  At
worst, they lose the suit and then pay some reasonable amount.  Unlike
a non-government entity, they aren't risking getting hit with an
injunction or attorney's fees, so I would guess there is no good
reason not to take a gamble.

The usual way the government gets caught is the patent holder tries to
interest the government in licensing the patent, or in purchasing some
system that contains the patented invention, and the government declines.
The inventor then manages to acquire whatever it is the government decided
to use instead, and finds that the government has incorporated the invention.

This scenario has obvious problems when the government agency is the
NSA!

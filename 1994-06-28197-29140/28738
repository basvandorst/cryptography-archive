:You seem to imply that these quotes are contained in the press

The second approximate quote comes from two sources;

The announcement of the approval of the
FEDERAL INFORMATION PROCESSING STANDARDS PUBLICATION 186,
DIGITAL SIGNATURE STANDARD (DSS),
which was published in the Federal Register on
May 19, 1994 starting on page 26208.
Signed by Samuel Kramer, Associate Director.
I had posted this document on the Newsgroups previously.

And i quote from this announcement, " NIST has addressed the
possible patent infringement claims, and has concluded that there
are no valid claims."



Also from my reading and note taking (I was not allowed to
photocopy), of the detailed justification document
which was presented to the Secretary and is part
of the public record and is available for inspection in
the Department's Central Reference and Records Inspection Facility,
Room 6020, Herbert C. Hoover Building, 14th Street between
Pennsylvania and Constitution Avenues, NW, Washington, DC  20230.

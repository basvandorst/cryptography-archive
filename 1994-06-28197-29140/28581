	Actually, there is a statutory bar (law preventing) to patents whose
only application is nuclear weapons. This is the only statutory bar regarding
subject matter that I'm aware of.

	Thus there are no US patents on H-bombs. Certainly not from lack of
invention, though.

[But this also has nothing to do with cryptography, hence the followups.]

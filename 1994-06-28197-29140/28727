: 	Of course if someone in the US actually accomodated his

	I'd certainly like it if someone did that for me, seeing how I 
don't really want to spend the money, and I am in the US, but I would 
like to have that disk. It would be even better if someone posted said 
uuencoded zip file to the net, for us all to peruse. Fuck ITAR. Fuck the 
NSA. Fuck the State Department. Fuck the DoD. Fuck anyone involved with 
restricting the export of crypto!

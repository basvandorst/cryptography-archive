Hi historians and cryptanalysts:

Don Davis and Kevin Brown have placed very interesting comments
on sci.math and sci.cryptr[-- ones that are very useful--- that
begin to show the human reasons why Neugebaur, Gillings and others
(a very long list indeed)_[ did not come up with

2/n = 1/a + (2a-n)/an, where a is a highly divisible number lying
somewher betwen a/2 and 2a/3 AND

a straight forward explanation of the choice of a!

The first problem for cryptanalysts is to break the 2nth code-- 
forwards and backwards-- a step that Neugebaur, Gillings et al --
did not publish. Given that the summary of the code breaking of
the 2/nth table is given by 2/n = 1/a +(2a-a[n)/an Don Davis'
discussion of both a and the finally LCM based set of 2a-n is
another point that Neugebaur, Gillings et al did not publish.

From my review of the the 100 year history of the 2nth problem,
beginning with Sylvester and Fibonacci's greedy algorithm-- too
much time has been spent on a geometry based Fibonacci dead end
and not enough time on unit fraction splitters-- using a form of
arithmetic that implies that Middle Kingdom scribes like Ahmes
tried very hard to avoid "round off" error problems associated
with Horus-Eye fractions, such as only using the termss upto 1/64
ectera, ectera!

It seems to me that given the purity of Middle Kingdom unit fractions,
a notation that was intellectually sufficient to remain in use for
over 3,400 years-- by even Classic and Hellene Greeks-- that a little
time should be spend respecting unit fractions--- and consider to
discontinue the conclusion that unit fractions were an adumberation
(to cite George Sarton's term).

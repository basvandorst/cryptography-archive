Z(> Speaking of ways round having to use Clipper, how about this: One 
of the
Z(> problems is going to be that manufacturers will be "encouraged" to use
Z(> Clipper as their encryption chip (where required). Why doesn't someone
Z(> design a chip that uses a known system, with the same pin configuration,
Z(> keying inputs, power requirements etc? Incidently, how bio-degradable are
Z(> ICs when they end up in a landfill? :)

One of the other problems will be that it will close the door to US 
MicroComputers in Canada and other neighboring countries, since no 
Canadian in his or her right mind will purchase a computer that 
permits the US government to intercept and read his or her computer 
communications, nor can I see the Canadian Government or any of the 
Provinces permitting the sale of such computers in Canada, or 
purchasing any themselves.

If the device (Tessera) is extended to modems, then the sale of US 
made modems will also plumet.  Since most of the US brand name modems 
are made in the far east, it may prove that the manufacturers will 
simply make two different versions, one for their domestic market, and 
another for their foreign markets, but it will make interoperability a 
problem. International communications will become a quagmire if the 
material leaves the US encrypted but cannot be read, or enters the US 
with a DIFFERENT encryption (which may be mandated by a non-US 
government in retaliation), and cannot be read.

Should be interesting to see how this shakes out!  I have to wonder if 
the US Congress has even given consideration to this aspect of the 
impact of Tessera and Clipper! (or cares)

Is there any truth to the rumour that the North Pole is migrating to 
Arizona to get warmer?  It sure feels that way!

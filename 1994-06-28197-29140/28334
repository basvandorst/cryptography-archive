See, NSA does know what its doing! You are now willing to buy one and
let them listen in.

I mean, if I was trying to trick everyone into using Clipper and still
make it easy for me to evesdrop, I couldn't come up with a better plan
(but then, NSA has lots of clever people working for them, and I haven't
had any motivation to really try).

Changing the LEAF would be a red-flag that the call should be monitored
and fed to the Skipjack backdoor.

What, do I sound paranoid? Hey, can I help it when reality is such
a good match for far-fetched conspiracy theories?

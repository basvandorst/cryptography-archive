I flatter myself that he is referring to me, after I proposed that service
to government is not necessarily the best service to one's country.

Oddly enough, I started in on him because of his own arrogance, which I
could not stomach. He and his type imagine that the government is now
going to infiltrate the net, like a sheriff coming to a lawless old-west
town, to "clean up this mess." What these people don't know, and what
we are duty-bound to show them, is that this "mess" is going to clean
*them* up.

The net belongs to us. Financially, culturally, socially, and politically,
it is a private enterprise now and government will be powerless to stop
it. They have become too enamored of their "data highway" analogy to
realize that they cannot install cops at intersections. They are so
blinded by their need to control that they cannot see their complete
inability to control the net. In desperation, they may try to destroy it,
but they cannot control it.

I think that it is up to us to show these people that no one wants them
here. No one needs them here. And no one will bow to them here.

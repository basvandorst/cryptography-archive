well, pedophiles are people too. why is everyone out to vilify everyone
for private sexual practices, anyway??!

it's clear that the information infrastructure should be conducive
to the distribution of pornography as a design criteria.

cryptography makes this unavoidable. whereever there is information
there is freedom to encrypt. only the institution of a Ministry of
Truth can ever prevent that. why, the even the sequence of periods in my
signature can convey information steganographically. are we therefore
going to outlaw periods? or design tappable punctuation for purposes
of government surveillance? Uncle Sam has forever lost the ability to
eavesdrop.

I'm not crying.

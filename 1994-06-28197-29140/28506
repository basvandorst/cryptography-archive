Can a registered crypto FTP account at RIPEM.MSU.EDU be accessed 
via a USA-based FTP-by-mail server, assuming the correct account 
ID and password are used, and the FTPed file is destined for the 
original, USA-based email address?  Or will the use of the 
intermediate server cause the request to be rejected because the 
host ID does not match the original one specified when the 
account was opened?

If so, can PGP 2.6 be FTPed from another anonymous FTP site, 
either in the USA or abroad?  Thanks.

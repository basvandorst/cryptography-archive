          WHAT'S NEW 

               This is version of 9.21V111 of VIRUSCAN (SCAN.EXE).  This
          release replaces Version 109.  Version 110 was used for the
          beta-test version of this release but skipped over for the
          production release.
               This release adds detection of 45 new viruses and 61 variants,
          bringing the total number of known viruses to 1,814, or counting
          variants, 2,738 viruses.
               Beginning with Version 111, we will now be using PKZIP
          Version 2.04g to archive our files.

               For a complete list of known viruses, refer to the enclosed
          VIRLIST.TXT file.  For a description of known viruses please
          refer to Patricia Hoffman's Hypertext VSUM.


          SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

               SCAN requires 390Kb of free RAM and DOS 2.0 or above.
          Additional memory is required for foriegn language support (see
          APPENDIX C for details).

          VIRUSCAN works with 3Com 3/Share and 3/Open, Artisoft LanTastic,
          AT&T StarLAN, Banyan VINES, DEC Pathworks, IBM LAN Server,
          Microsoft LAN Manager, Novell NetWare, and any other IBMNET or
          NETBIOS compatible network operating systems.  Contact McAfee
          Associates or your local Authorized Agent if you do not see your
          network listed.

               SCAN is designed to check floppy, hard, CD-ROM, and
          compressed (SuperStor, Stacker, Doublespace, etc.) disks on
          both stand-alone and networked PC's as well as network file
          servers for pre-existing infections of known and unknown
          viruses.  If you have a Novell NetWare file server, you may
          wish to use the NETSHIELD virus prevention NetWare Loadable
          Module instead.

               SCAN displays messages in English (default); foreign
          language support is available for many other languages.  Please
          refer to APPENDIX C for information on foreign language support.

          NOTE:  WRITE-PROTECT THE FLOPPY DISK CONTAINING THE VIRUSCAN
                 (SCAN.EXE) PROGRAM BEFORE SCANNING TO PREVENT VIRUSCAN
                 FROM BECOMING INFECTED BY A COMPUTER VIRUS.

          OVERVIEW (Known Virus Detection)

               VIRUSCAN Version 9.21V111 (filename SCAN.EXE)
          identifies all 1,814 known computer viruses and their
          variants.  Some viruses have been modified so that more
          than one "strain" exists.  Counting such modifications,
          2,738 viruses exist.

               All known viruses infect one or more of the following
          areas: the hard disk partition table (alias Master Boot Record);
          the DOS Boot Sector of disks; or one or more executable files on
          the system.  Executable files include operating system files,
          .COM files, .EXE files, overlay files, or any other files
          containing program code.  A virus that infects more than one
          area, such as a boot sector and an executable file is called
          a multipartite virus.

               SCAN checks files, subdirectories, diskettes or entire
          systems for pre-existing computer virus infections.  In the
          case of infection by a known virus, it will identify the virus
          infecting the system, the area(s) it was found, and the I.D.
          code used by CLEAN-UP to remove it.

               Infected files can be removed using the /D switch in SCAN
          to erase the file, or with the CLEAN-UP universal virus removal
          (disinfection) program.  CLEAN-UP is recommended because in most
          cases it will eliminate the virus and fully restore infected
          programs or system areas to normal operation.

               The accompanying VIRLIST.TXT file lists describes all
          viruses identified by SCAN and their associated I.D. codes for
          removal by CLEAN-UP.


          OVERVIEW  (Unknown and New Virus Detection)

               SCAN has three separate methods of detecting unknown and
          new viruses:

          ú     Validation codes which can be periodically checked against
                to look for the changes made by a virus to files or system
                areas.

          ú     Generic and Family virus detectors to look for new viruses
                which are derivatives of older viruses.

          ú     External virus signatures to insert new virus signature
                strings on a temporary basis to SCAN.

          SYNOPSIS (technical description of known virus detection)

               SCAN detects known viruses by searching the system for
          strings (sequences of bytes) unique to each computer virus and
          reporting their presence if found.  For viruses which encrypt or
          cipher their code so that every infection of the virus is
          different, SCAN uses detection algorithms (programs) that work
          by statistical analysis, heuristics, or code disassembly.


          SYNOPSIS (technical description of new/unknown virus detection)

              SCAN checks for new or unknown viruses by comparing
          files against previously-recorded validation (checksum) data.
          SCAN has two levels of validation which are stored in three
          separate ways:

          ú     A simple 10-byte long validation checksum may be appended
                to .COM and .EXE files.  If a file has been modified, it
                no longer matches the checksum and SCAN will report the
                file may have become infected.  (/AV, /CV, /RV switches)

          ú     An enhanced 52-byte validation and recovery data checksum
                can also be created.  This can be appended to the end of
                files like the 10-byte checksum, or stored in a separate
                log file which can be offline (e.g., on floppies) for
                recovery purposes.  CLEAN-UP can restore infected files,
                partition tables, or boot sectors using this information.
                (/AG, /CG, /RG switches and /AF, /CF, /RF switches)

          NOTE:  If validation codes are attached to files, SCAN will NOT
                 add codes to the partition table, boot sector, or system
                 files.  Instead, a separate hidden file will be created
                 in the root directory named SCANVAL.VAL containing data
                 for these areas.

          NOTE:  Files which are self-checking (e.g., Lotus 1-2-3) should
                 not be validated with the /AV (Add Validation) or /AG
                 (Add Generic) switches which modify files.  Instead, use
                 the /AF (Add File) switch.

               SCAN also checks for new or unknown viruses by searching
          for Generic or Family virus strings.  These are strings that
          have been found repeatedly in different viruses.  Since virus
          writers may use the older pieces of code for new viruses, this
          allows SCAN to detect viruses which have not been written yet.

               VIRUSCAN can be updated to search for new viruses by an
          External Virus Data File, which allows the user to input new
          search strings for viruses. (/EXT switch)

          AUTHENTICITY

               Before using SCAN for the first time, verify that it has
          not been tampered with or infected by a virus by using the
          the enclosed VALIDATE program.  For instructions on using
          VALIDATE, please read the VALIDATE.DOC file.

               The validation results for Version 9.21V111 should be:

          FILENAME:     SIZE:      DATE:        CHECK METHOD:

          SCAN.EXE      160,355    1-14-94     M1: 70B9  M2: 1DFA

          If your copy of SCAN differs, it may have been damaged or have
          options stored in it with the /SAVE switch.  Run SCAN with only
          the /SAVE option to remove any stored options and then re-run
          VALIDATE.  Always obtain your copy of VIRUSCAN from a known
          source.  The latest version of VIRUSCAN and validation data for
          SCAN.EXE can be obtained from McAfee Associates' BBS at (408)
          988-4004, from the McAfee Virus Help Forum on CompuServe (GO
          MCAFEE), the mcafee.COM anonymous ftp site on the Internet, or
          the McAfee area on America Online.

               VIRUSCAN performs a self-check when run.  If SCAN has been
          modified in any way, a warning will be displayed and the user
          will be prompted to either continue or quit.  SCAN can still
          check for viruses, however, if SCAN reports that it has been
          damaged, it is recommended that a clean copy be obtained.

               All of McAfee Associates' programs are archived with
          Version 2.04g of PKWare's PKZIP Authentic File Verification.
          When unzipped with Version 2.04g of PKWare's PKUNZIP program,
          an "-AV" will be displayed after each file is unzipped and an
          "Authentic files Verified!    # FZW807  McAFEE ASSOCIATES" will
          appear once all files are unzipped.

          NOTE:  If you do not receive the Authentic File Verification
                 messages, you may be using a different version of
                 PKUNZIP, such as V1.10 or V1.93A.  Use PKUNZIP Version
                 2.04g to unzip files if you wish to have Authenticity
                 Verification displayed as files are unzipped.

          COMMAND SUMMARY

          IMPORTANT NOTE:  WRITE PROTECT YOUR FLOPPY DISK BEFORE SCANNING
                           TO PREVENT INFECTION OF THE VIRUSCAN PROGRAM.

               VIRUSCAN checks files and other areas of the system that
          can contain a computer virus.  When a virus is found, SCAN
          identifies the virus and the file or system area where it was
          found.
               SCAN examines files based on their extension.  The default
          extensions supported by SCAN are .APP, .BIN, .COM, .EXE, .OV?,
          .PGM, .PIF, .PRG, .SWP, .SYS, and .XTP.  Additional extensions
          can be added with the /A to check all files.


          Valid options for VIRUSCAN are:

                           SCAN {drive(s)} {options}

          {drive(s)}       - Indicates a drive or drives to be scanned

          OPTIONS

               Following is a detailed description of VIRUSCAN's options.

          NOTE:  The /AV and /AG switches modify executable files, the
                 /SAVE switch modifies the SCAN.EXE file.  If SCAN is
                 run against a network drive, it must be run from an
                 account with rights to modify files.

          NOTE:  Changes made by the /AV, /AG, and /SAVE switches may
                 cause other anti-viral programs to generate a warning.

          /A - This option checks all files on the drive scanned and also
          examines a greater portion of files.  This substantially
          increases the time required to scan disks and also increases
          VIRUSCAN's ability to detect viruses in overlay files.  It is
          recommended this switch only be used when installing software
          or if a file-infecting virus has been found.  

          /AD{x} - This option scans all drives for viruses.  If /ADL
          is used, all local drives are checked, including compressed
          drives and CD-ROM's.  If /ADN is used, all networked drives
          are checked.  To scan local and network drives, use /AD by
          itself.

          /AF {filename} - This option logs recovery and validation
          data for .COM and .EXE files, boot sector, and partition table
          of a disk to a user-specified file.  The log file size is about
          20Kb per 1,000 files validated.  Recovery from a virus using the
          /AF information requires the CLEAN-UP (CLEAN.EXE) program.

          /AG {filename} - This option allows the user to store recovery
          and validation data for .COM and .EXE files, boot sector, and
          partition table of a disk.  Recovery information adds 52 bytes
          to files.  The recovery information for the partition table,
          boot sector, COMMAND.COM and system files is stored separately
          in a hidden file called SCANVAL.VAL in the root directory of the
          drive being scanned.  {filename} is an optional ASCII text file
          listing files NOT to add recovery and validation data to (see
          NOTE below).  Recovery from a virus using the /AG information
          requires the CLEAN-UP (CLEAN.EXE) program.

          /AV {filename} - This option allows the user to store validation
          codes for .COM and .EXE files, boot sector, and partition table
          of a disk.  Validation information adds 10 bytes to files.  The
          validation codes for the partition table, boot sector, system
          files and COMMAND.COM is stored separately in a hidden file
          named SCANVAL.VAL in the root directory of the drive being
          scanned.  {filename} is an optional ASCII text file listing the
          files NOT to add validation codes to (see note below).

          NOTE:  Files which are immunized against viruses or contain
                 self-modifying code should not have validation codes
                 added to them.  To prevent SCAN from adding validation
                 codes to these files, a validation exception list must be
                 created with the path and filename of each file NOT to be
                 validated listed on each line (only one filename for each
                 line).  To put a comment in, start the line with an "*"
                 character.  This sample file contains a list of programs
                 NOT to validate:

          *LIST OF FILES NOT TO USE /AV OR /AG OPTIONS WITH
          *
          *This is Nantucket Corp's database program, Clipper
          C:\CLIPPER\BIN\CLIPPER.EXE
          *This is Lotus Development Corp's spreadsheet program, 1-2-3
          C:\123\123.COM
          *This is Microsoft's database program, FoxPro
          C:\FOX\FOXPROLX.EXE
          *This is MS-DOS 5.00's self-modifying program, SETVER
          C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE
          *PKWare's data compression programs already perform a self-check
          C:\PKWARE\PKLITE.EXE
          C:\PKWARE\PKZIP.EXE
          C:\PKWARE\PKUNZIP.EXE
          *SemWare's QEdit text editor (which I am writing this with now)
          C:\SEMWARE\Q.EXE
          *Stac Technologies hard disk swapping program
          C:\SWAPVOL.COM
          *Symantec's Norton Utilities V6.01 disk caching program
          C:\NORTON\NCACHE.EXE
          *WordStar Corp's word processor is self-modifying
          C:\WORDSTAR\WS.EXE

               The validation exception list should be an ASCII or DOS
          text file.  If a word processor is used to create the list, be
          sure to save the file as ASCII or DOS Text.

          /BELL - This option causes SCAN to beep when a virus is found.

          /BMP - This option tells SCAN to check the OS/2 Boot Manager
          partition.  When run with this option, SCAN checks the Boot
          Manager partition and boot sector only.

          /CERTIFY -  This option will audit a system for files that have
          validation codes added to them with the /AG or /AV switches.
          Files that have no validation code will be reported as being
          uncertified by VIRUSCAN and an ERRORLEVEL of 3 will be returned
          after SCAN is run.




VIRUSCAN Version 9.21V111                                      Page 10


          /CF {filename} - This option checks recovery and validation data
          stored by the /AF option in {filename}.  If a file or system
          area has changed, SCAN reports that a viral infection may have
          occurred.  Using the /CF option adds about 25% more time to
          scanning.

          /CG - This options checks recovery and validation data added by
          the /AG option.  If a file or system area has changed, SCAN
          reports that a viral infection may have occurred.  Using the /CG
          option adds about 25% more time to scanning.  This option takes
          priority over the /CV option.

          /CHKHI - This option checks the memory from 640Kb to 1,088Kb
          which can be used on 286 and 386 systems by computer viruses.
          On XT systems, memory may be scanned twice.  Memory above 1,088
          is not addressed directly by the CPU and can not contain viral
          code.  This option cannot be used with the /NOMEM option.

          /CV - This option checks validation codes inserted by the /AV
          option.  If a file or system area has been changed, SCAN will
          report that the file or system area has been modified and a
          viral infection may have occurred.  Using the /CV option adds
          about 20% more time to scanning.

          NOTE:  Some older Hewlett Packard and Zenith PC's modify the
                 boot sector each time the system is booted.  This causes
                 SCAN to continually report that the boot sector has been
                 modified if the /CF, /CG, or /CV switches are used.
                 Check your system's manual to determine if your PC has
                 self-modifying boot code.

          /D - This option tells SCAN to prompt the user to overwrite
          and delete an infected files.  Files erased by the /D option
          can not be recovered.  If the CLEAN-UP program is available,
          it can be used to disinfect the file.  Partition table and boot
          sector viruses can not be removed by the /D option and require
          the CLEAN-UP virus removal program.

          NOTE:  If the /D switch is used against a network drive, SCAN
                 must be run from an account with erase or delete rights.

          /DATE - This option stores the time and date SCAN was last run.
          This is done by changing the date on the SCANVAL.VAL file.  If
          no SCANVAL.VAL file exists, SCAN will create a 0-byte long one
          in the currently-logged directory.







VIRUSCAN Version 9.21V111                                      Page 11


          /EXT {filename} - This option tells SCAN to search for viruses
          using virus search strings from ASCII text file {filename}, in
          addition to the viruses that SCAN looks for.  For instructions
          creating an external virus data file, refer to Appendix A.

          NOTE:  The /EXT option provides users with the ability to add
                 strings for detection of viruses on an interim or
                 emergency basis.  When used with the /D option, it will
                 overwrite-and-delete infected files.  This option is not
                 for general use and should be used with caution.

          /FAST - This option speeds SCAN up by displaying less on the
          the screen, skipping checking inside of LZEXE- and PKLITE-
          compressed files, and examining a smaller portion of files
          during scanning.  This may reduce the accuracy of SCAN.

          /HISTORY {filename} - This option saves the output of SCAN
          to {filename} in ASCII text file format.  If {filename} exists,
          SCAN will add the results of the current scan to the end.

          /M - This option tells VIRUSCAN to check system memory for all
          known computer viruses that can inhabit memory.  SCAN by default
          only checks memory for critical and "stealth" viruses, which are
          viruses which can cause catastrophic damage or spread the virus
          infection during the scanning process.  By default, SCAN will
          check memory for the following viruses:

             1024           1253          1530          15xx variant

          If any of the above viruses is found in memory, SCAN will stop,
          tell the user to power down and reboot the system from a virus-
          free system-bootable disk.  This option can not be used with the
          /NOMEM option.

          NOTE:  Using the /M option with another anti-viral software
                 package may result in false alarms if the other package
                 does not remove or cipher (hide or otherwise encrypt) its
                 virus search strings in memory.

          /MAINT - This option is used to scan hard disks partitioned
          with DOS 4.0 or above that have been damaged by a boot sector
          or partition table infecting virus or non-DOS partitions, such
          as those created by Novell NetWare/386 or IBM OS/2 V2.0 HPFS.
          Attempts to access damaged or non-DOS disks result in an
          "Invalid media" message being displayed.  When SCAN is run with
          this option, only the partition table and boot sector will be
          scanned.

          NOTE:  The /MAINT switch can only be used on a local drive.  If
                 you wish to scan the boot sector or partition table of a
                 network drive, SCAN must be run from the file server, not
                 a workstation.

          /MANY - This option is used to scan multiple diskettes placed
          in a given drive.  If the user has more than one floppy disk to
          check for viruses, the /MANY option will allows the user to
          check disks without having to re-run SCAN multiple times. After
          the system has been disinfected, the /MANY and /NOMEM options
          options can be used together to speed up the scanning of disks.

          /NLZ - This option tells SCAN not to look inside files 
          compressed with LZEXE, a file compression program.  SCAN will
          still check LZEXE-compressed files for viruses that may have
          become infected after LZEXE compression.

VIRUSCAN Version 9.21V111                                      Page 13


          /NOBREAK - This option prevents Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Brk from aborting
          the scanning process.

          /NOMEM - This option turns off all memory checks for viruses
          in order to speed up the scanning process.  It should only be
          used when a system is known to be virus-free.  This option can
          not be used with the /CHKHI or /M options.

          /NOEXPIRE - This option prevents SCAN from displaying a warning
          message after 7 months warning that it may no longer be current
          with respect to known computer viruses.

          /NOPAUSE - This option disables the "More? (H = Help )" prompt
          displayed when SCAN fills up a screen with 24 lines of text.
          This allows SCAN to run on PC's with severe infections without
          requiring operator assistance.

          /NPKL - This option tells SCAN not to look inside files
          compressed with PKLITE, a file compression program.  SCAN will
          still check PKLITE-compressed files for viruses that may have
          become infected after PKLITE compression.

          /REPORT {filename} - This option saves the output of SCAN
          to {filename} in ASCII text file format.  If {filename} exists,
          SCAN will erase it and replace with the current scan results.

          /RF {filename} - This option removes recovery and validation
          data from log file {filename} created by the /AF option.

          /RG - This option removes validation and recovery data from a
          file or files validated with the /AG option.  Using the /RG
          switch against a drive removes the SCANVAL.VAL file.  This
          option can not be used with the /AG option.

          /RV - This option removes validation codes from a file or files
          validated with the /AV option.  Using the /RV switch against a
          drive removes the SCANVAL.VAL file.  This option can not
          be used with the /AV option.

          /SAVE - This option stores any listed options for subsequent
          executions of SCAN.  The options are stored by modifying the
          SCAN.EXE executable file itself.  For example:

               SCAN /NOMEM /REPORT C:\SCAN.LOG /NOPAUSE /SAVE

          saves the default options to /NOMEM, /REPORT C:\SCAN.LOG and
          /NOPAUSE and will cause SCAN to use these options the next time
          it is run.  If SCAN is run with only the /SAVE switch, all saved
          options are removed and the SCAN.EXE is returned to normal.  If
          you do not wish to modify the SCAN.EXE file, use the @{filename}
          option instead.

VIRUSCAN Version 9.21V111                                      Page 14


          NOTE:  VALIDATE 0.4 must be used to validate SCAN V89 or above
                 if the /SAVE option is used.  /SAVE directly modifies
                 SCAN.EXE in such a manner that validate codes will not
                 match if an older version of VALIDATE is used.  VALIDATE
                 0.4 generates correct validation results if the /SAVE
                 option is used.


          /SHOWDATE - This option displays the time and date SCAN was last
          run on the specified drive.  No virus checking is performed.

          NOTE:  When run with /SHOWDATE, SCAN only displays the last run
                 date.  Viruses will *NOT* be checked for.

          /SUB - This option scans all subdirectories inside a
          subdirectory.  Previously, SCAN would only recursively check
          subdirectories if a drive was scanned at the root level (e.g.,
          C:).  Do not use the /SUB switch if you are scanning a drive
          from the root level.

          @{filename} - This option allows the user to store a list of
          options and drives to be scanned in a configuration file.
          Options need to be separated by a space, while drives (disks,
          subdirectories, or files) need to be listed on separate lines.
          A sample file might look like this:

          /A /BELL /CV /NOMEM /REPORT C:\VIRUSCAN\SCAN.LOG
          C:
          D:\BBS
          E:\MCAFEE\CLEAN-UP\CLEAN.EXE

          The first line contains the SCAN options while other lines list
          the names of disks, subdirectories, or files to scan.  The file
          should be an ASCII text file.  If a word processor is used to
          create the list, be sure to save it as ASCII or DOS text.

          EXAMPLES

               The following examples show different option settings:

               SCAN C:
                   To scan drive C:

               SCAN F:

          EXIT CODES

               After VIRUSCAN has finished running, it will set the DOS
          ERRORLEVEL.  ERRORLEVEL's are used in batch files to pass the
          results of a program's actions.  The ERRORLEVEL's returned by
          SCAN are:

               ERRORLEVEL ³ DESCRIPTION
               ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍØÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ
                   0      ³ No viruses found
                   1      ³ One or more viruses found
                   2      ³ Abnormal termination (program error)
                   3      ³ One or more uncertified files found
                   4      ³ Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Break aborted scan

          If a user stops the scanning process, SCAN will set the
          ERRORLEVEL to 4.  If you wish to prevent users from stopping the
          scanning process, then run SCAN with the /NOBREAK option.


          VIRUS REMOVAL

               What do you do if a virus is found?  You can contact McAfee
          Associates for help, their authorized agents, or use the CLEAN-UP
          program.

               McAfee Associates can be reached by BBS, CompuServe, FAX,
          Internet, or Telephone and there is no charge for support calls
          to McAfee Associates (Authorized agents may charge normal McAfee
          Associates consulting rates.).

               The CLEAN-UP universal virus disinfection program can
          disinfect virtually all reported computer viruses.  It is
          updated with each release of the SCAN program to remove new
          viruses.  CLEAN-UP can be downloaded from McAfee Associates'
          BBS, the McAfee Virus Help Forum on CompuServe, the mcafee.COM
          and Oak.Oakland.EDU sites on the Internet, the McAfee area on
          America Online, or from any of the agents' BBSes listed in the
          enclosed AGENTS.TXT text file.

               It is strongly recommended that you get experienced help in
          dealing with viruses if you are unfamiliar with anti-virus
          software and methods.  This is especially true for 'critical'
          viruses and partition table/boot sector infecting viruses as
          improper removal of these viruses can result in the loss of
          all data and the use of the infected disk(s).  [For a listing of
          critical viruses, see the /M switch listed under OPTIONS above.]

               Before removing a boot sector or partition table-infecting
          virus, it is recommended that you cold boot the infected PC from
          a clean DOS disk and backup any critical data.

VIRUSCAN Version 9.21V111                                      Page 17


               For qualified assistance in removing a virus, contact
          McAfee Associates directly or any of the Authorized Agents in
          your area.  Agents may charge McAfee Associates' normal consult
          rates for their services.

               If you wish to remove a file-infecting virus manually, cold
          boot the PC from a clean (virus-free) DOS system disk and run
          SCAN with the /A and /D switches to erase all infected files.
          Any files removed in this manner can not be recovered.

          APPENDIX A:  Creating a Virus String File with the /EXT Option

          NOTE:  The /EXT option is intended for emergency and research
                 use only.  It is a temporary method for identifying new
                 viruses prior to the subsequent release of SCAN.  A
                 thorough understanding of viruses and string-search
                 techniques is advised for using this option.  A string
                 length of 10 to 15 bytes is recommended.

               The External Virus Data file should be created with an
          editor or a word processor and saved as an ASCII text file.  Be
          sure each line ends with a Carriage Return/Line Feed pair.


               The virus string file uses the following format:

          #Comment about Virus_1
          "aabbccddeeff..." Virus_1_Name
          #Comment about Virus_2
          "gghhiijjkkll..." Virus_2_Name
               .
               .
          "uuvvwwxxyyzz..." Virus_n_Name


          Where aa, bb, cc, etc. are the hexadecimal bytes that you wish
          to scan for.  Each line in the file represents one virus.  The
          Virus Name for each virus is mandatory, and may be up to 25
          characters in length.  The double quotes (") are required at the
          beginning and end of each hexadecimal string.
               SCAN will use the string file to search memory, the
          Partition Table, Boot Sector, System files, all .COM and .EXE
          files, and overlay files with the extension .APP, .BIN, .COM,
          .EXE, .OV?, .PGM, .PIF, .PRG, .SWP, .SYS, and .XTP.
               Virus strings may contain wild cards.  The two wildcard
          options are:

          FIXED POSITION WILDCARD
               The question mark "?" may be used to represent a wildcard
          in a fixed position within the string.  For example, the string:

                             "E9 7C 00 10 ? 37 CB"

          would match "E9 7C 00 10 27 37 CB", "E9 7C 00 10 9C 37 CB", or
          any other similar string, regardless of the fifth byte.







VIRUSCAN Version 9.21V111                                      Page 20


          RANGE WILDCARD

               The asterisk "*", followed by range number in parentheses
          "(" and ")" is used to represent a variable number of adjoining
          random bytes.  For example, the string:

                             "E9 7C *(4) 37 CB"

          would match "E9 7C 00 37 CB", "E9 7C 00 11 37 CB", and
          "E9 7C 00 11 22 37 CB".  The string "E9 7C 00 11 22 33 44 37 CB"
          would not match since the distance between 7C and 37 is greater
          than four bytes.  You may specify a range of up to 99 bytes.
          Up to 10 different wildcards of either kind may be used in one
          virus string.


          COMMENTS
               A pound sign "#" at the beginning of a line will denote a
          comment.  Use this for adding notes to the external virus data
          file.  For example:

                             #New .COM virus found in file FRITZ.EXE from
                             #Schneiderland on 01-22-91
                             "53 48 45 45 50" Fritz-1 [F-1]

          gives a description of the virus, name of the infected file,
          where and when it was found, etc.

          APPENDIX B:  Miscellaneous Application Notes


          CHECKING MEMORY FOR VIRUSES ONLY

               VIRUSCAN can perform a quick check for viruses in memory
          only.  In this mode, SCAN will not check the disk for viruses.
          This option is useful for network administrators who need to
          check workstations for viruses before allowing them to log on to
          a LAN but cannot run the VSHIELD program due to memory
          constraints.  The command for this is:

               SCAN NUL /M /CHKHI

          By designating NUL as the drive to be scanned, SCAN will check
          system memory for viruses (up to 1088Kb if the /CHKHI option is
          used) and then return to DOS without scanning any disks.  SCAN
          returns the DOS ERRORLEVEL in the normal manner.


          VIRUSCAN VALIDATION CODES

               If you have installed any new software or programs on your
          system, and are running VIRUSCAN or VSHIELD with the /CF, /CG,
          or /CV validation codes options, you will need to reinstall
          validation codes to the new files with the /AF, /AG, or /AV
          add validation codes options of SCAN.  In addition, the
          SCANVAL.VAL hidden file containing validation codes for the
          partition table, boot sector, COMMAND.COM, and system files may
          have to be replaced (unhide the file with the DOS ATTRIB command
          and then delete it).
               The quickest way to update the validation codes is to
          remove all validation codes from the hard disk and then add them
          back by running SCAN with the /RV and then the /AV options.

          NOTE: This applies to any new version of DOS, as well as any
                programs which you install on your system.


          REFORMATTING INFECTED FLOPPIES WITH DOS 5.00 or 6.00

               When reformatting infected floppy disks under DOS 5.0, be
          sure to add the /U switch to the FORMAT command.  This tells DOS
          to do an Unconditional Format of the disk, without saving the
          original infected boot sector of the disk.  This should be done
          to prevent the reinfection by unformatting the disk.






VIRUSCAN Version 9.21V111                                      Page 22


          CREATING A RECOVERY DISK USING THE /AF OPTION

               The /AF switch added in Version 90 of SCAN creates a
          separate file to store recovery data and validation codes.
          This file can be stored off-line (on a floppy disk, network
          drive, tape drive, etc.) and accessed on-demand to check for,
          and recover from infection by unknown viruses.
               To create a Recovery Disk, format a system-bootable floppy
          diskette by typing "FORMAT A: /S" and pressing Enter.  Then,
          copy the VIRUSCAN (SCAN.EXE) and CLEAN-UP (CLEAN.EXE) files on
          to it.  Run SCAN against the hard disk with the /AF option.
          For example:
                             SCAN C: D: /AF A:\SCANCRC.CRC

          will scan the C: and D: drives for known viruses and create
          a file named SCANCRC.CRC containing recovery data and validation
          codes.  After SCAN finishes, write-protect the disk.
               To check for virus infection, turn the PC off, insert the
          Recovery Disk, and turn the power back on.  The PC will now boot
          from the floppy disk.  At the DOS prompt, type:

                             SCAN C: D: /CF A:\SCANCRC.CRC

          to compare drives C: and D: against the recovery data stored
          in the SCANCRC.CRC file on the A: drive.


               To disinfect your system, turn your PC off, insert the
          Recovery Disk, and turn the power back on.  The PC will now
          boot from the floppy disk.  At the DOS prompt, type:

                             CLEAN C: D: /GRF A:\SCANCRC.CRC

          to restore drives C: and D: with the recovery data stored in the
          SCANCRC.CRC file on the A: drive.

          APPENDIX C:  FOREIGN LANGUAGE SUPPORT

               VIRUSCAN can display messages in a foreign language by
          reading in a replacement set of messages from an external
          file named MCAFEE.MSG.  When the MCAFEE.MSG file is placed in
          the same directory as the SCAN.EXE file, SCAN will display
          messages from the foreign language module instead of displaying
          messages in English (American).  Currently, SCAN is bundled with
          two .MSG files, FRENCH.MSG and SPANISH.MSG, which contain
          messages in French (European) and Spanish (Latin America),
          respectively.

          NOTE:  Using a foreign language module increases CLEAN-UP's memory
                 requirements by the size of the foreign language file
                 (typically 15 to 25Kb).

               To use a foreign language module, rename it to MCAFEE.MSG
          and place it in the same directory as the SCAN.EXE file.  When
          SCAN is run, it will check for the MCAFEE.MSG file and use it,
          if found.

               Support for other languages such as Chinese, Dutch, Finnish,
          French (Canadian), German, Hungarian, Norwegian, Portuguese,
          Russian, Spanish (European), Swahili, Swedish and Bulgarian is
          planned for future releases.  Contact your local McAfee Associates
          Authorized Agent or McAfee Associates directly for availability.

WHAT IS IT?

RSAREF is a cryptographic toolkit designed to facilitate rapid
deployment of Internet Privacy-Enhanced Mail (PEM) implementations.
RSAREF represents the fruits of RSA Data Security's commitment to the
U.S. Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency
(DARPA) to provide free cryptographic source code in support of a PEM
standard. RSA Laboratories offers RSAREF in expectation of PEM's
forthcoming publication as an Internet standard.

Part of RSA's commitment to DARPA was to authorize Trusted
Information Systems of Glenwood, MD, to distribute a full PEM
implementation based on RSAREF. That implementation will be available
this spring.

RSAREF supports the following PEM-specified algorithms:

     o    RSA encryption and key generation, as defined by RSA
            Laboratories' Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS)

     o    MD2 and MD5 message digests

     o    DES (Data Encryption Standard) in cipher-block chaining mode

RSAREF is written in the C programming language as a library that can
be called from an application program. A simple PEM implementation
can be built directly on top of RSAREF, together with message parsing
and formatting routines and certificate-management routines. RSAREF
is distributed with a demonstration program that shows how one might
build such an implementation.

The name "RSAREF" means "RSA reference." RSA Laboratories intends
RSAREF to serve as a portable, educational, reference implementation
of cryptography.


WHAT YOU CAN (AND CANNOT) DO WITH RSAREF

The license at the end of this note gives legal terms and conditions.
Here's the layman's interpretation, for information only and with no
legal weight:

     1.   You can use RSAREF in personal, noncommercial applications,
          as long as you follow the interface described in the RSAREF
          documentation. You can't use RSAREF in any commercial
          (moneymaking) manner of any type, nor can you use it to
          provide services of any kind to any other party. For
          information on commercial licenses of RSAREF-compatible
          products, please contact RSA Data Security.

     2.   You can distribute programs that interface to RSAREF,
          but you can't distribute RSAREF itself. Everyone must
          obtain his or her own copy of RSAREF. (However, free
          licenses to redistribute RSAREF are available. For
          information, please send electronic mail to
          <rsaref-administrator@rsa.com>.)

     3.   You can modify RSAREF as required to port it to other
          operating systems and compilers, as long as you give a copy
          of the results to RSA Laboratories. You can't otherwise
          change RSAREF.

     4.   You can't send RSAREF outside the United States, or give it
          to anyone who is not a United States citizen and doesn't
          have a "green card." (These are U.S. State and Commerce
          Department requirements, because RSA and DES are
          export-controlled technologies.)

The restrictions on the distribution of RSAREF are the consequence of
export-control law. Similar constraints are placed on those
redistributing RSAREF under free license from RSA Laboratories.
Without the export-control law, RSAREF would be available by
anonymous FTP.


HOW TO GET IT

To obtain RSAREF, read the license at the end of the note and return
a copy of the "acknowledgement and acceptance" paragraph by
electronic mail to <rsaref-administrator@rsa.com>.

RSAREF is distributed by electronic mail in a UNIX(TM) "uuencoded"
TAR format. When you receive it, store the contents of the message in
a file, and run your operating system's "uudecode" and TAR programs.

For example, suppose you store the contents of your message in the
file 'contents'. You would run the commands:

     uudecode contents             # produces rsaref.tar
     tar xvf rsaref.tar

RSAREF includes about 60 files organized into the following
subdirectories:

     doc       documentation on RSAREF and RDEMO
     install   makefiles for various operating systems
     rdemo     RDEMO demonstration program
     source    RSAREF source code and include files
     test      test scripts for RDEMO

The "rsaref" directory tree here is largely a copy of the March
1992 RSAREF 1.0 distribution.  There have been some performance
enhancements (as noted in the code), but the functionality is
identical.

See ../doc/rsaref-license.txt for the most recent (December 1992)
version of the RSAREF License Agreement.  It is more liberal
than the one included here in the README.old file.

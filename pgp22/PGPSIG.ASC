This file contains a detached signature certificate for the MSDOS
executable version of PGP.EXE, version 2.2.  If you trust the signator
who created this signature, it should indicate that PGP.EXE has not been
tampered with.

To check the PGP.EXE file, use the most trusted copy of PGP you have
(An old one of you have it, or the one here if you don't) and execute
(assuming you have pgp 2.1 in the directory \PGP21) the command:

\pgp21\pgp pgpsig.asc

and, when it asks for the file name, tell it pgp.exe.

0.9 (beta)
----------
auto-pgp.el:   When viewing the results, and giving the option to replace,
               now uses a major mode (AutoPGP-Query mode).
               Changed all variable and function names from pgp- to autopgp-.
pixie.pl:      Works if accept succeeds but returns an empty peer address.
decrypt.pl:    Any `.gz' files created would be deleted, though none are yet.

decrypt.pl:    Changed $ENV{'PGPPATH'} and $pgppath to $config_pgppath.
               Any `.z' files created by PGP are now deleted.
auto-pgp.el:   Numeric prefix arg to C-x y d skips clearsig msgs correctly.
               Wrote pgp-sign-buffer, instead of pgp-sign-region.

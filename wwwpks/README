This is WWWPKS 1.0, a WWW interface to PGP Keyservers.

Where to find WWWPKS 1.0
------------------------
This distribution may be retrieved from:

	ftp://ftp-swiss.ai.mit.edu/pub/users/bal/wwwpks.tar

The Keyserver FAQ (at http://www-swiss.ai.mit.edu/~bal/pks-faq.html)
also contains a current pointer to the distribution.

Requirements
------------
To run, you must be running a WWW server that conforms to the CGI
(common gateway interface) spec.  You also need to have Perl installed
on your system, as well as a PGP binary.

Manifest
--------
README			This file
html/			Subdirectory containing html pages
scripts/		Subdirectory containing perl scripts

In the html subdirectory:

pks-toplev.html		The top-level ("home page") HTML file
pks-commands.html	The command page (has forms that interface 
			to the perl scripts)
pks-faq.html		The Keyserver Frequently Asked Questions file
pks-disclaimer.html	The disclaimer (so we're legally OK in the USA)
pks-email.html		A copy of the help file for e-mail users 
disabled-key.html	Error message to return when attempting to
			extract a disabled key.
	
In the scripts subdirectory:

pks-extract-key.pl	Perl script to extract indexes and particular
			PGP keys from a PGP keyring.
pks-add-key.pl		Perl script to accept key additions and send
			them to a PGP keyserver for processing.
cgi-hacks.pl		Some useful CGI functions.

Installation
------------

1) Copy the contents of the html/ subdirectory into your WWW server's
hierarchy.  My pages server out of my public_html directory, so I get
URLs of the form: 
	http://www-swiss.ai.mit.edu/~bal/pks-toplev.html
but the pages can go anywhere.  They should all live in the same
directory, since they make relative HREF references to each other.

2) Copy the contents of the scripts/ subdirectory into your WWW server's
cgi-bin or htbin directory (wherever CGI scripts live on your server).
Make sure the scripts are executable!

3) Configure pks-extract-key.pl

   a) On my system perl lives in /usr/contrib/bin/perl.  Change the first
   line of the file to point to wherever perl is on your system (usually
   /usr/local/bin/perl).

   b) Change the values of $PGP_BINARY, $PKS_EXTRACT_SCRIPT_URL and
   $TEMP_FILE_PREFIX as appropriate (see comments near the top of the
   file).

   c) Change the $ENV{'PGPPATH'} call appropriately to point to your PGP
   keyring. 

   d) Edit the name & address stuff appropriately.

4) Configure pks-add-key.pl

   a) Change the perl location (like 3a).

   b) Change the values of $PGP_MAIL_PROCESSOR and $PGP_SUBMIT_ADDRESS as
   appropriate (see comments at top of file).  New keys are piped through
   $PGP_MAIL_PROCESSOR; if you're not running your own keyserver you should
   be able to make this a call to sendmail.  $PGP_SUBMIT_ADDRESS is the
   e-mail address of the keyserver.

   c) Update the address stuff (yeah, it shows up in three places; I have't
   cleaned that up yet.)

5) Configure cgi-hacks.pl (change the local of perl as necessary (like 3a)).

6) Edit the html pages.  You'll want to replace my name & address with
your own & make whatever customizations you like.  pks-commands.html
assumes that the scripts are in /htbin/pks-extract-key.pl and
/htbin/pks-add-key.pl.  If they're someplace else you'll have to edit
the <form action=...> stuff appropriately.

7) That's it.  Make sure all the html pages are readable by your WWW
server and that the CGI scripts are executable.
 
8) Send me e-mail (bal@martigny.ai.mit.edu) when you've got everything
working.  I'll add you to www-pks-people@martigny.ai.mit.edu and add a
link to your keyserver interface on the master list I mainatain.

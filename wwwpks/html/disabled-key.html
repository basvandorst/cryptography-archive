<title>Public Key Server -- Disabled Key</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Disabled Key</h1>

The key you requested from the server has been <b>disabled</b> and
cannot be extracted.  Keys are disabled typically when the issuer is
no longer able to decrypt messages encrypted with that key.  For
example, a public key might be disabled if the corresponding secret
key has been lost.

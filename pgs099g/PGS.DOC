                       This public beta is freeware.


    Pretty Good PGP Shell is a user-friendly sophisticated professional
    shell to make working with Pretty Good Privacy (tm) a bit easier.


    Disclaimer:
      Although this software has been tested frequently between updates
      and prior to release, we can _not_ guarantee it is 100% error or
      bug free. We, Eric Limpens and Eelco Cramer will not be held
      responsible to any damage to you or your software/hardware in any
      case, although this might be due to PGS.

      However, we would appreciate any information about the cause of such,
      even though we don't think it will occur.

Features:

  - Usage of several userids for encryption/decryption.

  - Viewing key information without using any external software.

  - Editing a document/file using your favorite editor, prior to
    encryption of the document/file.

  - Executing _any_ DOS command using an improved DOS-shell, which
    claims only a few bytes of ram. (when swapping to XMS/EMS or disk)

  - Internal virus/tampering protection.

  - Almost every single PGP commands supported.

  - Easy to intergrate into your mailer using a combination of
    commandline & menus.

  - Enhanced keyring features.

  - Supports the maximum (1264 bits) keygrade of PGP.

  - Using a 32 Bits executable as replacement of the default MSDOS
    executable. - a STUBed DJGPP executable will work perfectly inside
    the shell, as long as GO32 is in the PATH variable.
    (Anyone got a Watcom version of PGP yet?!)

  - Create quoted reply on a message.

Known problems:

  - There seem to be some problems with the X00 fossil driver loaded as a
    TSR. We don't know why that problem occurs but there is a solution: Load
    the fossil as a device driver.

  - Apparently, when using the ReSizable Ramdisk (SRDISK 2.05), memory
    allocation failures appear. I'm busy on it, it might also be due
    to my pgp version, which runs using GO32.


Requirements:

  - At least DOS 3.1.

  - A 80286 or better.

  - PGP 2.3 or up.

  - Minimal 400K free base memory.

Usage:

 The Pretty Good PGP Shell usages a hierarchical menu set, which is divided
 so the commands of PGP can be reached at most ease.

 When using PGS in the command-line mode, you will only see the menus
 which are essential to the procedure which you like to use.
 For information about PGS, please use the online help facility, which can
 be used pressing F1 or F2. We could write a 300 page manual on PGS, but
 as this shell is quite self explanatory, and its use is intended for the
 more professional user, we don't...



Credits:

       credit where credit is due, these people have encouraged us in
       creating this shell, supporting us with information which was
       essential to some of the functions it includes, and for fool-proof
       testing and figuring out how many bugs it still contained......

       Branko Lancaster  - Who supplied us a copy of his key-ring
                           dump procedure, which was the base of the
                           several procedures which read the information
                           from the public and secret keys.

       Ralph Brown       - For creating a great (gigantic) database of the
                           DOS and BIOS services. Check out the INTERxxx.ZIP
                           files on the SIMTEL-20 sites.

       Larry Reeve       - Who donated his NBDETECT to the public audience.
                           With which we urge you to register this software
                           when used on a network based system. <grin>

       The NHL           - Who supplied us with enough equipment (although
                           a bit slow on the fileservers now and than) and
                           with the Borland C 3.1 environment.

       The NSA           - For beta testing ?


                           -- This does NOT mean they get a registration
                                  discount or whatever favour --

       ...and you, for using our software...

 Last Notes:

        Why are governments of all countries trying to ban encryption of 
        your private data? Here in the Netherlands, the ministry of justice
        is changing (at least they are trying really hard) the law, so that
        data-encryption will be prohibited when using datacommunications.

        This law will no longer permit it to transmit encrypted mail over
        data-lines which run through the Netherlands. When your British
        (encrypted) mail is going to Belgium, and it is routed thru
        Holland, you are breaking the law, and are therefore an outlaw...

        Although the public isn't allowed to use encryption for its privacy,
        the Government will be able to give some people the right to us it
        though. This will, in simple terms, mean that I may no longer send
        encrypted mail, but police, defense and who ever is working for
        the state will be able to do so.

        When governments all over the world will prohibit the usage of
        encryption for datacommunications, people no longer will have privacy,
        unless they want to break the law.

        When you think you can live with this, why don't you send your
        tax-forms on postcards ?? People are permitted to privacy, and,
        although data-communications are very easy to scan for certain
        contents, most e-mail users don't think their mail might be subject
        to scanning...

        We encourage every one to use encryption algorithms which are not
        easily decrypted when you don't know the password or you don't have
        the decryption key.
        When you use the standard DES encryption technique, which is also
        used in the US version of the Norton Utilities, you can test for
        your self how easy files encrypted using this algorithm can be de-
        crypted using a -trial and error- based technique. When you supply
        and encryption password like XXXXXX and you try to decrypt with XXXXYY
        or YYYYXX you will see the file was decrypted ok.

        When using PGP, you can't be 100% sure someone hasn't created a
        technique to decrypt encrypted files without the need of a
        pass(word/phrase) and/or a secret key, but with the current
        technical level of microprocessor power, and with the knowledge
        of decryption, it is a reasonable secure system to use, although,
        when you like to have some privacy ;-)

        Apparently governmental institutes are afraid to lose control of
        the data-flow. It is ofcourse very easy to send the queens' diary
        to someone in a foreign country using e-mail.
        But isn't the security of the diary the biggest problem ?

        When all systems containing vital information encrypt their
        information using a neat standard (PGP?), and when these systems
        are well equipped against intruders (with the people who know what
        they have to do to create a secure system), there should be no
        fear about encrypted datacommunications.



     ... when you outlaw privacy, only the outlaws will have privacy...

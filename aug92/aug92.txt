                        NEWSLETTER


NIST GOES ON TRIP '92 
On November 16-20, 1992, CSL will host an Open House as part of 
the Transcontinental Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) 
Project 1992 (TRIP '92), cosponsored by the North American ISDN 
Users' Forum (NIUF) and the Corporation for Open Systems (COS). 

The week-long event, involving 74 user organizations in 149 
locations across North America as well as several international 
locations, will showcase real applications of ISDN available to 
government and industry and will demonstrate the national ISDN 
network.   
 
As chair and secretariat of the NIUF, CSL plays a key role in 
TRIP '92 by encouraging the participation of other federal 
agencies who are interested in utilizing ISDN technology in their
applications.  Our involvement in the event underscores the 
federal government's commitment to ISDN and its willingness to 
take an active role in defining ISDN applications and user 
issues.  
 
Highlighted by "The Golden Splice," a major event in Washington,
D.C. to initiate new ISDN services, TRIP '92 marks the end of a 
maze of incompatible switches and customer equipment and the 
beginning of a national telecommunications infrastructure based 
on Bellcore's National ISDN-1 (NI-1).  CSL's Open House will mark
the event with demonstrations of ISDN applications targeted at 
specific government agencies and other interested audiences.  
Public events in the NIST Open House schedule are as follows: 
 
     Monday, November 16 
          Afternoon:  Military and Related Government 
 
     Tuesday, November 17      
          Afternoon:  Internal Revenue Service, Department of 
          Veterans Affairs, and other Civilian Government 
 
     Wednesday, November 18   
          Morning and Afternoon:  Cooperative Partners, Sponsors,

          and Guests 
 
     Thursday, November 19 
          Morning:  Washington ISDN Users Group Kickoff Meeting 
          Afternoon:  Local Government and Business 
 
     Friday, November 20 
          Morning and Afternoon:  NIST Employees and Public.

FEDERAL INFORMATION PROCESSING STANDARD (FIPS) ACTIVITIES 
FIPS for Key Management Approved 

The Secretary of Commerce has approved FIPS 171, Key Management 
Using ANSI X9.17, for federal agency use.  The standard adopts 
ANSI X9.17-1985, a voluntary industry standard for managing the 
keys used in secret-key encryption.  FIPS 171 specifies a set of
options for the automated distribution of keying material by the
federal government using the protocols of ANSI X9.17.  To be 
effective October 30, 1992, FIPS 171 will enhance 
interoperability between systems built to conform to this set of
options and will reduce the cost of building and testing such 
systems.   
 
Approval of FIPS 172, VHSIC Hardware Description Language 
On June 29, 1992, the Federal Register announced the approval of
FIPS 172, VHSIC Hardware Description Language (VHDL).  FIPS 172 
adopts American National Standard Hardware Description Language 
VHDL (ANSI/IEEE 1076-1987) which specifies the form and 
establishes the interpretation of programs expressed in VHDL.  To
be effective December 31, 1992, the new standard will promote the
portability of VHDL programs for use on a variety of data 
processing systems.  

 
Proposed FIPS for Standard Page Description Language (SPDL) 

A FIPS for SPDL has been proposed which adopts the International
Standards Organization/International Electrotechnical Commission
Standard Page Description Language (SPDL), ISO/IEC DIS 10180.  
The standard defines a device-independent format for representing
documents in their final, formatted form to printers or other 
presentation processes.  Combining the image description 
technology of modern page description languages with a document 
structure which enables efficient processing and page-image 
management, the SPDL FIPS will promote the interchange of 
documents between systems of different manufacturers.   

 
Proposed Withdrawal of Family of Input/Output Interface Standards

The withdrawal of eight FIPS which comprise the family of 
input/output interface standards has been proposed.  Changes in 
the marketplace and in computer technology prompt this action.  
Standard computer system interfaces are widely used by computer 
and peripheral system manufacturers, so the federal government no
longer needs to require the use of standards for interconnecting
peripheral systems and computers.  Further, agencies have 
requirements for advanced technology to support processing speeds
that are well beyond the data transfer rates supported by these 
FIPS.   

 
FIPS 125, MUMPS, Being Revised 

The Federal Register of May 26, 1992, announced the proposed 
revision of FIPS 125, MUMPS (Massachusetts General Hospital 
Utility Multi-Programming System).  The revision adopts American
National Standard for MUMPS (ANSI/MDC X11.1-1990) which specifies
the form and establishes the interpretation of programs written 
in the MUMPS programming language.  To be published as FIPS 125-
1, the revised standard will promote the portability of MUMPS 
programs for use on a variety of data processing systems. 
We welcome comments from industry and the public on this proposed
revision.  You may obtain a copy of the specifications (ANSI/MDC
X11.1-1990) from the American National Standards Institute, 11 
West 42nd Street, 13th Floor, New York, NY 10036, (212) 042- 
4900.  Written comments on the proposed revision should be 
addressed to the Director, Computer Systems Laboratory, ATTN:  
Revision of FIPS 125, Technology Bldg., Room B154, NIST, 
Gaithersburg, MD 20899.  The comment deadline is August 24, 1992.

Moby lexical database sampler

Use any text editor or viewer to browse the samples.   

These files contains representative portions of the Moby lexical databases;
in most cases the entire letter 'A' is represented. For the largest databases
only a portion of the 'A' entries are sampled. (Sort order may vary in the
actual Moby products.) For each database, the corresponding 'README' file
is included for instructions on fully interpreting the data in each lexicon.

The total number of entries in the series is as follows:



o Moby Words II more than 610,000 thousand words and phrases in English;
o Moby Hyphenator II more than 185,000 fully hyphenated words and phrases;
o Moby Part-of-Speech II more than 230,000 fully marked words and phrases
(entries with more than one part of speech rank them in priority order);
o Moby Pronunciator II more than 175,000 entries fully pronounced using
ASCII IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet);
o Moby Thesaurus II more than 30,000 root words and 2.5 million synonyms
and related words.
o Moby Language a median size of 100,000 entries for five world languages;
o Moby Shakespeare contains the complete works: poems and plays.

        If there is a more appropriate group for this, perhaps a
        stats newsgroup, please let me know.

        An aquaintance has a requirement for a large quantity of
        truly random values.  I believe the application for which
        they are required is a genetic mutation simulator.

        The way he has gone about getting this random data is a method
        used in several encryption programs, namely asking the user to
        type keys, and recording the intervals between keystrokes with
        a hi-res timer.  In fact, I believe he threw together a TSR
        which trapped keystroke intervals over the course of a day or
        so, in order to get a sufficient quantity of data.

        This is fine as a random bitstream, but for his application,
        he needs a set of random _values_, in a defined range, with
        the constraint that there must be at least one of each
        possible value.  I am completely useless at stats, so could
        people suggest how this might be achieved?

        Thanks in advance.

True, the spoofer might do this for a sigle route, but doesn't the 
mechanism in 2.0 sound workable? If you get a key for someone you know 
at a distant site via several mutual friends, how likely is it that he 
could avoid the spoofer changing all of them? Seems like the difficulty 
of a spoofer dealing with multiple route is real near infinity.

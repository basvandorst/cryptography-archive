Begin forwarded message:
 
 
I wish to apologise but the port of PGP 2.0 to VMS is broken. It was last
checked properly at 1.8 and since that time, I have had no chance to verify
it and in theory it was being checked by someone else. If you read the
README.VMS, you will see that it is still preliminary.
 
I will post the source patches to the VMS version as soon as possible (within
a week).
 
Hugh Kennedy.

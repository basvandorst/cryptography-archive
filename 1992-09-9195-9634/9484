According to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, it is impossible to
observe a system without disturbing it in an unpredictable way.  The
magnitude of this uncertainty is h/2pi, where h = Planck's constant
= 6.626e-34 Joule-seconds.  This results in all sorts of quantum
phenomena.  For instance, electromagnetic waves behave as a
continuously varying field, but are observed as discrete photons.

If you attempt to measure a photon's polarization, your answer will
fall in 90 degree increments to your detector's orientation.  Furthermore,
your measurement will orient the photon to it's measured polarizaion.
As long as quantum mechanics holds, it is impossible for an eavesdropper
to measure a photon's polarization without disturbing it in a detectable
way.

Quantum mechanics seems irrational, but it is well accepted and verified
by many experiments.  I could philosophise that it follows from a
universe containing finite observable information, but that's getting 
off the subject...

Keywords: cryptograms simple substitution

There are several sources of such cryptograms.

1.  Your local newspaper may carry them.
2.  Puzzle books (eg Dell) often carry a section on simple substitution
  cryptograms.  My grocery stores carry these.
3.  "The American Cryptogram Association", which publishes a bi-monthly
  magazine called "The Cryptogram" with various degrees of difficulty
  from beginner to very difficult (that is, weird text).  There is also
  "undivided" cryptograms and foreign language simple substitution and
  also other historical cryptograms to solve (such as Playfair, etc.).
  I don't have the address with me of the ACA.

PS  Should this sort of info go in the FAQ?

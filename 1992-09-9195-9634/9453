To whom it may concern,

I had posted a message on rec.puzzles about those interested in solving
cryptograms.  Just simple letter substitutions such as those found in
crossword puzzle magazines.

I surveyed the last few hundred messages on this bboard, but found no
articles that seemed relevant.  Is anyone interested in simple
substitution ciphers?  Or have they become passee?  I realize that they
may be easy to solve given a good pattern-matching program and an
extensive dictionary, but I still enjoy tackling them with pencil and
paper.

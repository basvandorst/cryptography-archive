An *even* simpler fraud than that is the following. Place the
following advertisement in any large metropolitan or national
newspaper (names etc. paraphrased):

			 Sally Sue Cosmetics
	     Receive $89.99 worth of name brand cosmetics
			  for only $19.99!!!
		       Visa/MasterCard Accepted
			 Call 1-800-555-5555
			  6-8 weeks delivery

Then contract with any telephone order service (basically an answering
service) to collect name, address, credit card number, telephone, etc.
The order service will deliver to your doorstep a list (on tape,
printout, whatever) with all the suckers that called in. While your
"customers" are waiting for their order, you can rob them blind. By
the time they've noticed the problem, you're long gone. 

This is a true story, reported in a recent 60-minutes (a U.S. news
show). The perpetrator was a prisoner, awaiting trial for murder. And
while he was waiting, he ran this and other successful telephone scams
right from his cell.

Face it, no matter how sophisticated you make your authentication
scheme, if the end user doesn't know how to take adavantage of it,
they're going to get ripped off. You are much better off trying to
educate them (a lost cause, but far cheaper than technological slight
of hand), in hopes that someone learns something.

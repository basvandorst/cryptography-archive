In another case I know of, the crooks broke into a bank branch and spent
several hours with a thermic lance going through the back of the machine.
They should have bought a manual first - instead of getting the crypto keys,
or at least the cash, all they managed to do was incinerate the cheque 
deposits.

There have been quite a number of cases in the UK of crooks using a mechanical 
digger to take the whole machine away. Sooner or later, one of these crooks
will not just take the cash but do some `practical cryptanalysis'. Maybe 
they already have and this is why there's so many phantom withdrawals,

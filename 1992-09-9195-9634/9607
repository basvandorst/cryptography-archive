      Just a question, but: Why are public key's needed from everyone, and why
   is certain verification of these keys needed?
Suppose you want to send somebody email, without anyone able to eavesdrop on you.
To do that, you need to encrypt the data, and they need to be able to
decrypt it on the other end.  Traditional private-key encryption (like DES) 
means you have to find a secure way to send them the key - so you have
to pre-arrange with someone if you want to send them mail.
Public key encryption uses a public key to encrypt and a corresponding
private key to decrypt - they can publish their private key,
you can use it to encrypt a message, and they can decrypt the message
with the private key.  (Actually, public-key is usually slow, so you encrypt
the message with DES and use public-key to send them the key for DES, but same effect.)

Also, some kinds of public-key systems can be used for digital signatures  -
they write a message, decrypt the plaintext with their private key,
and you encrypt it with their public key, and get the message -  so
you know that only they could have signed it, because only they know the private key.

The problem is how you know if the public key for Joe Recipient is
REALLY their public key, instead of being a fake put there by the Bad Guys.
Certification is one way to know you've got the real key --
so you know your mail to them isn't being read by somebody else,
and the digital signature on the electronic-funds-transfer check isn't forged.

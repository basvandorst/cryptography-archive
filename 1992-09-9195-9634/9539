 First of all, my money comparison was made with respect to the
 putative level of secrecy often thought inherent in a public-
 key cipher.  This level is presently thought to be extremely high.
 And this makes almost any other attack less expensive.

 Moreover, the cost of lots of things is different when we work
 with data.  The cost of penetration might just be some clever way
 of getting a Trojan program widely distributed; i.e., virtually
 no cost at all.  There also may be little delay.

 Next, I would be rather surprised to find that the US government
 is the only sneaky organization in the world with the resources
 to initiate such an attack.  In fact, I would expect that other
 governments, and various forms of private enterprise would enter
 the picture as well (probably first).  This assumes, of course,
 that we effectively standardize on a protocol they can break
 (like unvalidated public keys).

 Last, it is only necessary to subvert the *entire* network if you
 want access to *everything* on the network.  If you subvert the
 home node of the target of an investigation (or every node normally
 carrying mail to and from that node) then you have that node.
 (Assuming that unvalidated public keys are used.)  You also have
 everybody on that node, and perhaps everything traveling through
 that node as well.  Everyone for the price of one, so to speak.

 The accepted method is to create a bureaucracy of key-certification
 authorities and certificates.

 I would vastly prefer some alternative to CA's, but not so much
 that I would sacrifice security.  If we don't really care about
 security, we might as well use rot13, or give up ciphers entirely.
 If all the Opponent has to do is to turn its attention toward
 you to penetrate your security, you cannot reasonably be said to
 *have* security; what you have is the *illusion* of security.
 We call such ciphers "broken."  Nobody wants to use them.  Why?

 It seems to me that separate channel validation (e.g., by phone)
 would catch much of the spoofing (assuming the phone company is
 secure).  Maybe we can come up with something better.  If not,
 that doesn't change the limitations inherent in what we have.

 Presumably, you do not send information in your letters which
 could produce extremely serious consequences (loss of life,
 freedom, or treasure) were it released.  If you do, you should
 re-think this policy.

 Perhaps you do not need cryptography at all.  It is highly
 unlikely that traffic-monitoring programs can do much more than
 scan for words of "special interest."  Stay away from such words,
 communicate by euphemism, and you should be OK.  If you are
 willing to accept *probable* security, you have that now, and
 you don't need cryptography to get it.

 But if you need cryptography, you aren't likely to want it to
 fail.  This simply means doing everything reasonable to prevent
 failure; occasionally failure does happen.  But you probably
 would want to avoid the situation where the Opponent merely has
 to look your way to penetrate your security.  If you want to
 price your security, note that, once your part of the network
 has been subverted, the "cost-per-intercept" would be exceeding
 low.  A cipher *known* to be vulnerable to this attack should be
 described as having little or no security *value* whatsoever.

 It's only fine for you if you don't need security.  Unless your
 correspondent uses your currently-valid key, your communications
 may be going through a spoofing node (and being read) you would
 not know it.  This is "easy" because the spoofing node may have
 published a *different* key as your own, or one of your old keys.
 The correspondent uses that key, and the spoofing node translates
 those messages into your key before handing them on.  The first
 message to you will carry the key which you will use to reply.
 If that key is replaced with a key from a spoofer, *your* security
 is at risk.  This is only possible because of unvalidated public
 keys.

 There really is no point in using a public key if it is not
 valid.  You might as well not bother with cryptography at all.
 If you want privacy, just ask everybody not to look.
 Cryptography is used when you want to make it (almost)
 impossible for them to do so, regardless of what *they* want.


>Oh, not to make you angry, but, see, I just don't agree with you:

 Well, any attacks would be in the future, which is naturally
 speculation, and you may well disagree with my predictions.
 The attacks require unvalidated public keys:  If people see the
 problem and avoid using such keys, this will "change the future"
 such that these attacks make no sense.

 But my description of the weakness inherent in unvalidated public
 keys is not speculation; it is fact.  It is not necessary for you
 to *agree* with this for you to be affected by it.

 Why do you imagine that there has been a lot of talk about public
 key "certification authorities?"  Do you imagine this was proposed
 for fun, because of a lack of common sense, or as some government
 plot?  It is an attempt to acquire security which is simply not
 available from unvalidated public keys.

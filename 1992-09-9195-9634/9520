Are you aware of the RSA-129 contest?  Back in 1977, RSA published a
129-digit number which is supposedly a product of two primes.  They have
offered a $100 prize to the first person to factor it.  So far, nobody has
done it (publicly, at least).  This would be about 430 bits.

Of course, if NSA had succeeded, they would not claim the prize or advertise
their achievement.

Just in case you're curious, the number is 11438162575788886766923577997

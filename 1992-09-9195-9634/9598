The OS/2 support is broken. I made some small change to pgp when 1.0 was
current and therefore the reference to OS/2 is still in the docs (the
patch was integrated into pgp at that time, I think).

However, I have PGP 2.0 now working on OS/2 2.0 (i.e. 32-bit) now and
will try to get my (little) changes integrated into pgp.

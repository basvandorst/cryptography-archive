That description is far too broad. You cannot singlehandedly restrict
information to a chosen recipient, because he can in turn give the
information to someone else. You pose an impossible problem; is it a
surprise that there are no solutions?

For all you know, Terry, there could be a middleman between you and the
entire rest of the world. Call him God if you want. He's spoofing every
message your eyes send to your brain! (In fact he switched purple and
yellow when you were a kid.) Nothing you can ever do will prove the
non-existence of this middleman, or remove his interference. Do you
care?

Public-key cryptography ensures continuity, in a sense that is easy to
define mathematically. If you want more than continuity---if, for
instance, you want to stop God from spoofing your messages---then I'm
afraid you're up the creek. That doesn't negate the usefulness of
public-key cryptography for the real world.

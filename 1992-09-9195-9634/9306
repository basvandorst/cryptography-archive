Easy! 150 KV across any exposed metal. That's high tension!

Seriously, can you open those things by using an electromagnet
external to the lock? If the hasp is magnetic and isn't held in place
by a separate catch, I'd tend to think so. But then I guess it'd be
free to spring back, making it vulnerable to carding.

I'd agree that not many do now, but it wouldn't be difficult:

	echo "Subject?"
	read subject
	$EDITOR /tmp/message.$$
	crypt </tmp/message.$$ >/tmp/cmessage.$$.cr
	echo "address?"
	read address
	[uuencode]
	mail -s $subject address </tmp/cmessage.$$.cr

... substituting something a bit more robust for 'crypt', of course.

All it takes is the will to do it. Actually not a bad idea for this to
become routine; should use up some of those spare cycles on the 'ol
NSA computers. (1/2 :-) )

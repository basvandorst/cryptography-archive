I agree. After graduating from Emory Univ, I worked for a few years for a
researcher in the Chemistry Dept there who had a DEC PDP-10. The university's
insurance company made us put in an alarm system, since the room was in an
infrequently-patrolled corner of the basement. You could set off the motion
detector by shaking the doors fairly gently. On the other hand, if you moved
*very* slowly -- the 2 inches/sec mentioned in the film feels a little fast,
actually -- you could open the door, move into the room, and get all the way
through the "protected" anteroom and through the door into the main computer
room (which itself wasn't protected, because the air from the cooling fans
set off the alarm) without triggering the alarm. Only took a little practice.

When I told my boss, he didn't care. The alarm was just there to satisfy the
insurance company! As long as we had it, and it worked, they would pay off
on any loss...

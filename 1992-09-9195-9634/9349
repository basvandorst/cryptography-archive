Well, now wait a minute.  Let us turn on our "willing suspension of
disbelief"-icators and review these scenes.  1) It was certainly my
impression that the acoustic coupler was being used for the voice-
stress analyzer hookup, a reasonable hack.   2) Who says that was
a logic probe?  It looked more like a scope probe, or possibly a
*signal injector* probe.  Again, not *entirely* unreasonable.  It's
not like they named the computer WOPR again.

(Yes, admittedly, there were some pretty obvious foulups, particularly
in proceedure, but none of them were movie-busters, and the above two
were far from heinous.)

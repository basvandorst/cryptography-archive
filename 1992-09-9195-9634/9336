Like most such things, widespread encrypted mail won't be common until
someone incorporates it transparently into a readily available
mail program. Given the copyright hassles this is not likely to
happen with "free" mailers for some time. One would expect RSA
themselves to come out with a modified version of a mailer
one of these days, if they have not done so already, but for a fee.

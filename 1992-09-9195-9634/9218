There was a recent exchange in this group on this subject.  This
attack reduces the number of encryptions to break DES to about 2**47.
Note that this is a chosen plaintext attack, which means that the
attacker has to provide some 10**15 bytes of data to be encrypted.
Note that the attacker can't do any of this himself; his enemy, who is
being attacked, must do the encryption and return the data to his
attacker.

This means that for all practical purposes DES is still secure against
differential attack.

However, a massively parallel machine could be used in a known
plaintext attack, which would require some 2**55 encryptions to find
the key.  As the attacker could use millions of DES processors in
parallel, this would be much more practical than the differential
attack.

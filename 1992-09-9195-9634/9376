It's not at all bad.  They've put a lot of work into it.  It's a
clearly written, informative document.  It does bang on about RSA's
patents, and it is slightly biased in favour of RSA as opposed to
ElGamal signatures.  However, it seems to me that RSA have gone to
great lengths to be seen to be above criticism for producing an
"advert".

As an intro to modern cryptography, it's OK, if rather lacking in
technical content.  If you don't want to get into the details, but
rather want to know how to _use_ encryption, it's a good place to
start.

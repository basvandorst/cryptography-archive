Hi,

I am currently working on a VLSI implementation of DES and will soon need to test it.  I've heard that NBS have published a set of tests to validate the operation of a DES-chip, and if the tests are passed then they will endorse the chip.  Does anyone know anything about this, if so could you please email some details.

Thanks

John

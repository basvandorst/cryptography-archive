It looks like a pretty decent program.  I'm glad it makes a closer
attempt to comply with the RFCs than the old version, though it looks
like it was more with the objective of doing different encoding rather
than complying per se; it doesn't look possible for PGP to decrypt
messages sent by some other program, or vice-versa.  It appears to have
been designed with a near-paranoid rabidity about security, which is good.

It's too bad it (through little fault of its own) fails the test of "Can
I use it without fear of being sued, fired or expelled?" for us here in
the U.S.  For that matter, the addition of IDEA [depending which legal
forecasts you believe] may allow our European friends to share in this
sensation.  (Would multiple DES encryptions with some padding provide
comparable security without legal clouds?)

(Oh, and there's just one "But does it..." offhand:  does it allow for
authentication without encrypting or encoding the plaintext [i.e. doing
the MIC-CLEAR encryption type]?)

I wonder if it would be possible to port it to use RSAREF and make it
"legitimate".  It would sort of change PGP's "flavor" though.

What's the use of a good quotation if you can't change it?

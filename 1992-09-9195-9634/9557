   In other words, if see someones public key, how can I find what really
   big number they used? And then after I factor it, what whould I do to the
   encrypted communications to return it to plain text?

RSA is based upon the mathematics that given one of the numbers,
namely the public key, it is REALLY difficult to find either the other
key or the "Really Big Number".  Basically, you would have to do a lot
of number crunching to try to crack RSA given only the private key.
That is why it works.  If, given one key, you could come up with the
other, it wouldnt provide much security, would it?  Your assumption of
being able to factor large numbers has, to date, proven incorrect (as
factoring numbers is still one of the most difficult things to do).

   Finally, is the product of two primes method used in all public keys, or
   just in RSA? what about PGP?  What about the one the NSA and NIST produced.?

Most Public/Private Key systems depend upon the multiplication, in
some way, of two large primes.  The security is based on the fact that
factoring a large number is difficult to impossible.  RSA is only one
algorthm, and there are a few others, too.  PGP is not a different
algorithm.  In fact, PGP uses RSA!  So, yes, PGP uses the product of
primes, too.  As does the NIST digital signatures, too, although I'm
not 100% sure about their basis algorithm.

I hope I've cleared up some of your misconceptions.  I just hope that
the PGP 2.0 implementation of RSA is good (and secure).  The
algorithm, so far, has proven good, but a bad implementation can be
hazardous.

BTW -- here is my PGP 2.0 Public Key.  If you want to verify it,
and you have AFS, this can be found in the file

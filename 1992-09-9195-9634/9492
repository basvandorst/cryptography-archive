Hey, it's a movie, not a proposed design for reality.  I haven't seen
the movie, but it sounds like the details of the technology are purely
incidental.  The chip is what Hitchcock called the McGuffin -- a plot
device.  It is merely an excuse for the action in a movie.  The fatal
flaw in the movie analyses I've been seeing here is that Sneakers is
being treated as if it were Science Fiction, where there is supposed to
be some sort of internal consistency (though in SF _movies_, this rarely
occurs).  Sneakers is not SF, it's an action vehicle for Redford, in an
attempt to recapture some Three Days of the Condor nostalgia.

Personally, I'll probably pass.  I can wait til it reaches cable...

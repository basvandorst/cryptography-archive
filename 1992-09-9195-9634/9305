Most decent locks are resistent to the tension method of breaking the lock
numbers.  But the ironic thing is that the cheaper locks are *HARDER* to
break in some ways.  This is because the tolerances are so lousy that it
is hard to get a good feel of which element is next.  But then, I'm talking
about pin or wafer locks.

Now, how does one put tension on an electronic lock? :-)

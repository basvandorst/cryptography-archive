Has the IDEA cipher a longer key than DES and is it thus more resistant
to trying out all possible keys? Does the IDEA cipher use transpositions
interleaved with substitutions or some other algorithm? Is a paper 
describing IDEA generally available? (I'm not interested enough to order
a copy by mail from Switzerland.)

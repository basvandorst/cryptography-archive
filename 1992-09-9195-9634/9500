It seems to me that public keys are useful against tapping. There are
two types of insecure channels- ones in which your enemy may be making a
copy of all correspondence, and one in which your enemy can control what
the channel actually carries. Public keys are very useful in the former
case, but Ritter argues that there may be problems in tehlatter case.
Obviously if someone can control all I/O between you and the world, he
can cocoon you in a virtual reality, so you need a seperate channel
which may be insecure but at least not controlled to check this out.

The second point is how do I send messages to someone over a partially
controled channel- How do I knwo the public key I find on the Net is
yours and not my enemies. Again I need an insecure uncontrolled channel
to check. I also cannot see any way in which a potentially controlled
channel can be used to assure myself that your published key is really
your key. (or that the key you have for me is really mine). 
However the ability to dispense with the necessity for a completely
secure channel seems to me to be a great benefit of public keys.

No because the seperate channel may be tapped- Ie, you cannot be sure
that your enemy isn't listening in. Public keys allow you to use such
channels as far as I can see.

I am planning on using Borland's Paradox for storing information of 
a highly personal nature (part of our expanding net will soon be
linking in a counseling center).  Does anyone know if the security
level of this software is reasonably good?  I don't expect it to
stand up to a really devious hack, but I'd like to be able to assure
the client (the counseling center director) that Paradox encryption
schemes will keep out 99.9% of intruders (it's a big campus, so one
in 1000 may really be a little low, but you get the idea). 

I know from reading this group that WordPerfect encryption is easily
defeated, so I'll warn him about that.  We are also considering Foxpro,
since they claim to be coming out with encryption capabilities for
their database.  I know I could ask the companies themselves, but I
tend to doubt that I would get an unbiased opinion of the utility of
their encryption schemes :)

I already downloaded PGP 2.0, and would love to see a windowed front-end
for it (the counselors who would need to use it would be easily confused
by UNIX-like switch options).  

Any help on any of these issues would be GREATLY appreciated.  Thanks.

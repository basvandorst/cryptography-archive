This entire argument has revolved around establishing the private key of
someone you haven't met, or can't meet, in person or by telephone.  Pray
tell, just why would you want to do that?  No matter how the person comes
across on newnews, he or she could be an agent provacateur or spy or...
I mean, the ultimate (and simplest) spoof is to just pretend to be someone
else when you are on the net.

Why would you attempt to set up a secret channel with someone you haven't
'vetted by other means?

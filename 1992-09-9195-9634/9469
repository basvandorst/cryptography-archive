Let p be the number to be tested. Consider the finite field with p^2
elements. The Rabin test does a probable prime test in the sub-field
whose order is (p-1) [i.e. Z/pZ].  The Lucas test works in the (twisted)
subfield whose order is (p+1).  It is essentially the same computation as
the Rabin test, but uses a different group (or sub-field).

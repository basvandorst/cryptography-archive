        Many thanks to all those who replied to my request for an MD5
        port to MS-DOS.

        It would appear that the problem was indeed with my compiler;
        I applied some goat's blood and chicken feathers (explicit arg
        lists, a couple of casts and separate modules for FF, GG, etc)
        and the thing now passes all the tests.

        I suspect the nested #defines were too much for my ancient ZTC
        compiler. Maybe I should pop for an upgrade. If anyone's
        interested in the revised code, let me know.

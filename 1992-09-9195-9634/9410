Actually, I think Hollywood knows plenty about finite groups. That's
why we keep seeing the same plot elements recycled in different 
combinations. The openning to Sneakers, for instance, is a "rip-off"
of the openning to "Three Days of the Condor"-- another of Redford's
films. They have finite groups for neuroses (n different types),
challenges/ threats (m different types), locations (p different places),
and racial/ethic backdrops (r different cultures) and spin them 
around. As long as m,n,p and r are mutually prime, they can keep
going without resetting the plot wheels.

Sorry. Patent for this one is pending. I have written a program that simulates
the friction of two sticks together and a temperature result. This prgram is
used to drive one stick turning inside a small hole of another one (so there
is hardware involved) to the point there is a fire. I am expecting royalties
from every use of fire in a couple of months.

No, according to the documentation it's not. Looks like we all have to
distribute and collect new keys.
Hardly surprising, as one of the great new features of version 2.0 is
key authentification, where a trusted third party can vouch for a to you
unknown public key. Lack of key authentification was a serious deficiency
in PGP 1.0, and I guess the key layout had to be changed in order to
incorporate this feature.
Note: I haven't studied the source too closelyy, so I might be in error
on this one, but it seems logical to me.

The good news is that the authors of version 2.0 have said that they
intend to do what they can to keep future versions of PGP key-compatible
with version 2.0.

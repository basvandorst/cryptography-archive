Forgive me for just not knowing what you are referring to.  What do
you mean by subversion here, Terry?  Do you mean any of the following?

1. All communication channels are monitored and filtered.
2. Your private keys are known to the adversary.
3. All public keys have be spoofed by an interposer, both yours and other's.

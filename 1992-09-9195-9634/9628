There's also the sci.crypt FAQ (available at rsa.com:/pub/faq), which
is useful to read when talking about RSA public key encryption.

Obligatory whine:
(1) why do people post their public keys?  One feedsite can mangle with your
public keys very easily.  I'd rather receive someone's public key via email,
finger or ftp rather than through netnews.  Sure, those are vulnerable too
but netnews is much easier to mangle lots of articles at a single choke
point.
(2) why don't people put expiration dates on their public keys?

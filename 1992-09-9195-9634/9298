I recently had a chance to play around with pgp2.0 on a sVr2 Unix machine.
There appears to be a big security problem with the signature mechanism:
If you "sign" a file, and then add additional information to the end of
the signed file, pgp includes this additional information as part of what
it says you signed.  For instance:

echo 1 2 3 4 5 | pgp -fs >xyzzy.pgp
echo 6 7 8 9 10 >>xyzzy.pgp
pgp xyzzy.pgp

pgp now tells me I have signed the phrase:

	1 2 3 4 5
	6 7 8 9 10

when I have in fact only signed the first line.

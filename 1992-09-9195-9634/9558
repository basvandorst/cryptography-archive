OK Terry, your main point seems to be the same as mine.  Use of a public key
received via email (for example) opens you to interception and the like.
The single-point-failure (email channel) is too easy to spoof.

Your solution is to use a secure channel (such as in the flesh) to exchange
keys.  This is ideal when practical.

My solution is to widely dessiminate my public key.  And for you to widely
dessiminate your public key.  Same for everyone else.

Now - the single-point-failure is eliminated.  All that is needed is for
anyone suspecting spoofing to verify that the public postings of his key and
of his correspondents keys are unaltered.  As an example, go to a payphone
and call a dozen people around the world who post to the net.  Total strangers
whom you have never communicated with.  Have them fetch the keys from their
handiest local source.  Do they all match?  And do they match *your* copies
of the keys?  Yes?  Then your public keys are good.  No?  Then your node or
path is being spoofed.  Grab the shotgun and go hunting.

The only time this check could fail is if your correspondent didn't bother
to also perform the above procedure.  But the mere fact that he *might*
do this should deter any prospective spoofer who values his hide...

If you do change your public key, just allow enough time for all of the public
key archives to be updated, perform the check again, and keep on chugging alon

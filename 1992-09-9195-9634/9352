All the talk about longer PINs, better keypads, smarter cards, banks not
interested in spending on fraud, etc. leads me to suggest the following,
(which just in case nobody has suggested it before, I'll retain any rights
publicising the idea here may give me, then allow use of it by all except
the bunch of fools I deal with who dare to call themselves a bank ;-):

Why don't all banks and other organisations requiring what are in effect
ID cards get together, create a single (smart) card with a single PIN of
however many digits is socially and security-wise acceptable, and then put
all their institution-specific information on that single card?  The banks
would, I suggest, _love_ the problem of customer authentication taken
out of their hands and the burden placed somewhere else.

Ideally, governments should introduce such a thing as an identity card
and licence card companies, banks, etc. to piggy-back their stuff on it.
The government guarantees that the card holder is who their PIN says they
are, and the burden of fraud is spread - we pay ever so slightly higher
taxes, but lower bank charges.

OK, so the civil libertarians don't like the idea of big brother watching
us through universal identity cards, but in this market economy world
you can always set one (low) scale of charges for those who reckon they
have nothing to hide and another (higher) rate for the libertarians who
want to have lots of individual cards.  Money talks eventually.

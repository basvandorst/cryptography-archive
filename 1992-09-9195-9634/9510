Gee, Terry, why can't God be spoofing your phone calls? When you meet
someone in person to ``verify'' your public key, how do you know it
isn't actually God, posing as that person? Is all cryptography useless?

(Maybe God [ya know, big guy, beard, rests on weekends] doesn't do such
things, but the CIA does. In fact _everyone Terry has ever met or
communicated with_ works covertly for the CIA. No wonder he's paranoid.)

The point of cryptography is to _increase the cost_ to the enemy of
decoding or spoofing messages. Security is not a yes-no proposition.
It's a matter of economics. You want to increase the (minimum perceived)
cost of an attack past the (maximum perceived) benefits. Sure, God can
always get around your security, but it costs a bit much to defend
against his attacks, so why bother?

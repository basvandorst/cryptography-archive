I utterly disagree.  There is no way to describe the enforcement of an
algorithm patent as "enlightened".  It's like saying "Frank is a good
jailer, he doesn't tie my shackles too tight".  They (the IDEA
licensors) _do not_ allow the free use in PGP in general, only in
noncommercial cases.  Which means that you and I can communicate with
PGP until we wish to discuss business; then we have to start paying
money.

I am not opposed to the copyrighting of code, but algorithm patents
are a way to prevent the application of ideas, something we haven't
seen since the dark ages.

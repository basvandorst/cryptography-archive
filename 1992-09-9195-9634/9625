It can if you use a little common sense.  Carry on a conversation with the
person.  If you met on alt.beer, talk about beer until you're convinced it's
the same person.  This does not eliminate spoofing completely -- the
CIA/whatever could assign a beer expert to the fake phone number; but it
makes it a lot more difficult.

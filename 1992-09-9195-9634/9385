I had no difficulty downloading or printing the low memory version using
Ghostscript 2.4.1. BUT it appears that RSA has sort of encrypted the text
so that after the table of contents which prints as expected, the text then
changes font and point size AT EACH CHARACTER. This does not absolutely
prevent reading but makes it damned unpleasant. I guess they want you to
buy the book when it gets published. Why they made this available for 
ftp downloading is beyond me, I dislike them for wasting my time and paper.

"Partly it may be due to a phenomenon known since the very dawn of spaceflight
in connection with certain pharmaceutical drugs. They induced adverse
psychological effects, including radical changes of mood and personality.
However the fact that they were prescribed by a physician militated
against the patient's chance of deducing that they were the proximate cause
of his suffering; indeed, he would be more inclined to ask for further drugs
to counteract the first, and since the whole process was extremely profitable
for all concerned save the ultimate consumer, they would be provided.

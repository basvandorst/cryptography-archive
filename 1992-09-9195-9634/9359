That idea is going around in the scandinavian countries right now.

A single card standard is not the same as a single card.

Why PINs? When you're talking smart cards you'd be better off using some
cryptographic signature for authentication. Ok, the card may have a PIN
as well.

Well, you could go for some voting protocol to stay anonymous. You must,
however, leave some good information accessible to the people who provided
some service paid for with the card/received some service to be paid to the
cardholder.

That's a stupid argument. It's very easy to believe that all the others
do have something to hide. Why not say "The world is a nude beach"?

(In other words, you cannot claim that you should be able to do it your
way, and the others can do it their way - though they'll probably look
silly doing it...)

That's a different problem.

Well, suggest a better way of authentication. Remember that the method
must include some way of retracting a forged identity / lost(stolen) key.

Not being familiar with "RSAREF" and assuming for purpose of argument
that PKP's patent covering "all public key" implementations is valid
why would the use of RSAREF make PGP legitimate?  Is there licensing
for it that is not available for PGP or is it for some reason not
covered?  I guess I'm looking for your definition of legitimate.

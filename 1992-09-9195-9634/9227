Hey, that means that there won't be laws against encryption in USA,
since the second amendment guarantees to right to keep and bear arms.
Or perhaps it was a misprint and the right was only to keep bear arms
after all, since other kinds of arms have many restrictions even
today.  Bummer - but perhaps someone can design an encryption
algorithm which is to be used against bears, and so you guys in USA
would be guaranteed to use that freely?

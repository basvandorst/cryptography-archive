I thought that acoustic modems had to have the phone inserted into the rubber
'boots', in the movie it looked like they just lay the phone on top of the
coupler.

The scene where they walked slowly through the room to avoid setting off the
sensors is valid.  I did this once in a place I worked to show the boss that
their much vaunted security wasn't so hot.

As for the module, a few years ago a company from Santa Barbera demoed a small
block of pink plastic.  You hooked an Apple II to one end and Macintosh to
the other and ran some software on the apple II.  

In a few minutes the box had converted the program on the Apple II into a
program that ran on the Mac.

I talked with them after the demo and suggested that their software and firm-
ware might have applications in cryptography.  They said they were aware of
that.  As far as I know the product (which was really fantastic) never went
anywhere.

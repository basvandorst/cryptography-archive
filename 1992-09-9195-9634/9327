I think the biggest flaw in "Sneakers" is that it treats information
(the decryption program) as a physical object (by actually putting it
in a physical object).

In a more realistic movie, everyone would be searching hard disks for
copies of the program rather than the Bay Area for a box. The movie
would have ended when someone posted the "Too Many Secrets" program to
sci.crypt.

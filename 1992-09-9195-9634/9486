If a mathematician discovers something, he writes it down way before he 
builds a chip for it. (In fact, I don't think you could design and build 
such a chip without writing it down.) So the guy in the movie, Janek, must
have had his technique written down somewhere. Now, he clearly knew the
importance of his discovery (that's why he hid the device inside an 
answering machine). So not only did he write it down, but he probably had
backup copies at his home, in his safe deposit box, etc. So even after he
was killed, some bad guys could go find his discovery. To me, the way the
movie implied that destroying the chip eradicates the theoretical 
breakthrough was a serious flaw in the plot and made the whole thing 
unrealistic.

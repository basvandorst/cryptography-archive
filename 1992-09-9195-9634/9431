[excerpts from an article by Anthony Ramirez for the New York Times;
 printed in the Minneapolis (MN) Star Tribune 15-Sep-92 page 7E]

"By using a radio signal different from that used in older cordless
phones, new [ones] can be used [...] in some cases as far as a half-mile
away.  Moreover, new digital technology in one model eliminates static
and scrambles telephone signals into thousands of different kinds of
computer code, foiling eavesdroppers."

Vendors/prices named: Panasonic (a $450 model), VTech Communications
($350), Code-A-Phone, and AT&T.

Perhaps they were beta testing?!?          :->

Sounds interesting.  I wonder how secure it really is.
Anyone else know more?

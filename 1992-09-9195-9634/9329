   I think the biggest flaw in "Sneakers" is that it treats information
   (the decryption program) as a physical object (by actually putting it
   in a physical object).

   In a more realistic movie, everyone would be searching hard disks for
   copies of the program rather than the Bay Area for a box. The movie
   would have ended when someone posted the "Too Many Secrets" program to
   sci.crypt.

In a more realistic movie, they wouldn't be using modems where you put
the telephone mouth piece on a suction cup to make a connection with a
computer.  How about using a logic probe to connect the black box to
the computer??  These aren't meant to be flames, just realism
comments.  I really liked the movie because it was funny and kept me
entertained, not for it's representation of technology.

PS:  Don't watch this movie with four or more computer science
students together.  It sorta ruins the movie for you and the people
around you.  

PPS: It's amazing how many people will believe whatever shows up on
the screen.  The people sitting believe us were saying something like
"I can't believe that they can do that," or "I didn't think that was
possible," throughout the entire movie.  It was a source of a minor
chuckle for us.  :)

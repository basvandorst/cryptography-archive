    It's hard to believe they don't read this group - how about it
    guys? Just a short message with your public keys for comparison.

    It isn't, but they have put in the hooks to assure upward
    compatibility in future versions.

MOREOVER:

    To get the value of this, it seems to me that we all should take
    the earliest opportunity to begin broadcasting public keys and
    maybe convincing some ftp archives to start collecting them. I'm a
    newbie on Usenet so I have no idea how best to do this.

    Re spoofing: If I'm worried that someone's got a wedge in my mail,
    I could send messages to a number of people who have published
    their keys. The message would be encrypted with their public key
    and contain copies of my public key inside and out. The message
    would include instructions like "Please reply with a single word
    'tomato' if both are the same and 'asparagus' if they are not,"
    using a different pair of words for each message.

    Whoever is spoofing would have no way of knowing what to do,
    unless they were also spoofing everybody else. The best they could
    do is stop the replies entirely, which would tell me what I needed
    to know. At this point I would send my public key under cover to a
    bunch of people with a request to broadcast it, along with a
    disclaimer on the spoofer's key.

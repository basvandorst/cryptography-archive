The device referred to is for modular exponentiation.  Modular
exponentiation is an arithmetic operation which has been known for a
long time.  It is not patented.

The RSA cryptosystem uses modular exponentiation to perform encoding
and decoding.  So does the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol.  So
does the El-Gamal code.  The operation is basic to modern algebra and
seems to be fundamentally complex.

Modular exponentiation hardware is not under the purview of any
patent.  Software which implements RSA on such hardware does fall
under the purview of patents.

Modular exponentiation chips are available from Cylink.  Off the top
of my head, a 1024 bit modulus chip costs $80 in low (not small)
quantities and takes about half a second to perform an operation.

I've loved reading all these posts about the new PGP program. Unfortunately
some of us don't have FTP access and so cann't download it.

Can someone uuencode the source and post it either in this news group or one
of the Binary/source newsgroups. It's a little difficult understanding the
technicalities of a program you haven't seen!

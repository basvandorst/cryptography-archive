I've been advised to post this request to this group ...

I'm seeking a program/method which will generate pronounceable passwords,
securely.  Meaning the process by which the actual password is generated
should be genuinely random enough so an attack at the algorithm (by
whatever means) would be infeasable.

We are using a John F. Haugh's shadow login utility here.  I've seen,
documented, a similar feature available under some derivitive that
SCO UNIX has provided.  IE the feature is embedded within the actual
passwd program.  If I can get a decent utility to provide this 
functionality, I would like to embed this in our passwd program.  Of
course, everyone has their own view of what is considered a 
pronounceable password.  

I think (?) UUNET has such a procedure, but am not sure.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Please respond via email as
our site does not get fed this group (yet).

Forrest

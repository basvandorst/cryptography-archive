Sir:  You are hereby notified that a Patent Secrecy Order has been
placed on your invention of fire.  You are not to discuss this 
invention with anyone.  Any further use of fire by you or anyone
else will result in prosecution.  Conviction may result in the
testing of a new invention, "burning at the stake", but you may
not discuss that, either.

It is further ordered that sticks and stones are now export-controlled
munitions.  You may export them, to certain countries only, provided
you have obtained an export license for each individual stick and stone.

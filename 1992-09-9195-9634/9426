  I was hoping there'd be somebody on who is into cryptography not
necessarily related to computers - not that one might not be able to solve
my problem.  I have an old foreign-language text which I think may
actually be an encryption.  If my thinking is right so far this text
"blossoms" or "unfurls" to form a topological figure of serious import. 
If anybody out there (after deciding if this is "for real" or not) has any
interest in this sort of thing, please e-mail me.
  I suppose this will either be viewed as something useless and/or nutty
by most.  It is neither.  A partial "decryption" has pretty much been done
on the first twenty seven letters and they appear to be a "key".  I'm not
that good with cryp.  I was exposed to some in the military.  I was a
VietNamese linguist with Air Force Security Service.  But this is
something with which that type of cryptographer would not have dealt.  If
there's somebody who's up to a REALLY good prob, lemme know.

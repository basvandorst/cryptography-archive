I can think of one good reason.  If the PINs were much longer, more people
would write down their PINs on something that they kept with their ATM
cards, in order to remember them.  This would be worse than a 4 digit PIN
in that a stolen wallet breaks security immediately.

Because ATMs eat cards after a few bad attempts, an average of 5000 tries
to guess a PIN is from a practical standpoint enough.  The increased rate
of loss due to PINs kept with cards outweighs the increased security that
a longer PIN would afford.

I agree that a 4 digit PIN is too short for comfort, but this sort of
finantial security is necessarily built around the average and worst case
users.  A possible improvement would be to allow users to have longer PINs
without requring them.

Over the summer I finally got around to reading Codebreakers and
I found it really interesting.  I was wondering what other books 
on the same subject are out there.  I am mainly looking for 
introductory to intermediate level books, preferably with an
emphasis on the use of computers in this field. 

Please e-mail me as I do not always find time to read this group.
Thanks in advance.

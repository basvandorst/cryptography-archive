I have ftp'd pgp20.zip from 2 different sites (binary mode) and
downloaded them to my humble PC to discover that PKUNZIP considers
that SOME of the files are corrupt.  I'm currently using PKUNZIP v1.02 .

Have others experienced this problem ?  NSA plot ???  My ignorance :-}

Comments Appreciated,
Tony O'Hagan.

PS I've had many years experience in ftp'ing and downloading.
I think I've considered the obvious, but always willing to learn.

Several people have reported that RSA's postscript versions of their
(reportedly very nice) FAQ didn't print for them.  It didn't for me either.

I emailed to them about it, and got a response from Paul Fahn
(the author).  Apparently they are aware of it, but feel that the
problem is not on their end, since it prints fine for some folks. 

Well, since I'm not a postscript guru (and Paul admits he's not either), 
I guess we're all SOL.  Grrrr.

For the record, I'm FTPing to a VAX (VMS) (yes, in binary mode), using
LZDCMP to un-.Z it, and sending the resulting postscript file to our 
Digital LN03 laser-printer.  I have tried all three versions:
	"Big" version:         Symptoms A and X
	"Low Memory" version:  Symptoms B and X
	Pages 1-10 version:    Symptoms A and Y

Symptom A:  Postscript job terminates with the following error message:
  %LPS-W-TYPCHK, typecheck: Argument of wrong type - offending command is show

Symptom B:  Postscript job terminates with the following error message:
  %LPS-W-UNDEF, undefined: Name not known - offending command is -

Symptom X:  Cover page and TOC pages i through iii printed (only)

Symptom Y:  Cover page and TOC page i printed (only)

Also, as previously reported, some of the characters on the title page
overstrike each other (the rest of the output looks fine).

... <sigh> ...

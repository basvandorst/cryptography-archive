I'm afraid you can't do that :-(.  I submitted that method of
verification to the patent authorities 4 days ago, (NOT!) and
subsequently posted the method on one of the PGP newsgroups.

Certainly it isn't a PERFECT method - but it's probably better than
e-mail, because it tends to involve a closer connection.  

Hmmm...  Could there be a way of using a Gopher server to do this sort
of thing?  I see another patent coming on...

Perhaps a comment from a layman will be thought appropriate.
ATM fraud is an economic enterprise. That is the crook is going 
to have to make money on the deal. Complicated schemes to gather
thousands of PIN's to rob thousands of accounts are all very well.
However if the outcome of this is too deposit thousands of individual
sums into the account of Joe Bloggs (computer thief and chef international),
the long arm of the law will not be far behind him on the electronic road.
The cops say to break up an elaborate criminal conspiracy, one should
follow the money. Here the crook is not only leaving a paper path, he
is providing a road map.

IMHO anyway

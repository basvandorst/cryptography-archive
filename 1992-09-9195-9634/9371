           I'm pretty new myself, (actually this is my first reply <G>)
           but isn't the idea with PGP that a centralized place for keys
           isn't needed or perhaps...wanted? I thought the whole idea is
           that we personally trust the person acting as an "introducer".

          Whew! This is all new to me but I don't see the point in sending
          a public key "under cover". It would seem to defeat the whole 
          purpose of having a public key. From what I read in the docs for
          PGP20, it's totally up to me to make sure a public key is valid.
          If I add a key to my keyring, I better make sure I know where I
          got it from. And...no one that has my "real" public key can read
          my stuff unless I lose control of my secret key. Again, all based
          on levels of trust.
    
          If I have this all wrong, I'll be more than willing to listen to
          someone who knows more about public-key encryption than I do.
          (which includes just about everyone <G>)

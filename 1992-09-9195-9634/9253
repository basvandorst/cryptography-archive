Good day.

I have downloaded the UNIX release for PGP 2.0 from ghost.unimi.it and
placed it in ftp.uni-kl.de:pub/atari/incoming.  I tested compilation
and basic functionality on a SUN Sparcstation, and the docs say that
it should also compile on an Atari.  I have not tested that yet.

The files are pgp20src.zoo (for MSDOS-like systems) and pgp-2.0.tar.Z
(for Unices).  The archives contain exactly the same files; just the
names are different.

Please note that this software originated outside the USA, so you
might not legally be able to import it.  If anybody is interested in
the docs, I can mail them some 150K bytes of ASCII text.  Here is the
blurb:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) ver 2.0 - RSA public-key encryption freeware
for MSDOS, protects E-mail.  Lets you communicate securely with people
you've never met, with no secure channels needed for prior exchange of
keys.  Well featured and fast!	Excellent user documentation.

PGP has sophisticated key management, an RSA/conventional hybrid
encryption scheme, message digests for digital signatures, data
compression before encryption, and good ergonomic design.  Source
code is free.

Filenames:  pgp20.zip (executable and manuals), pgp20src.zip (sources)

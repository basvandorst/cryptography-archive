With regard to public key distribution and security, I favor public repositorie
s
such as FTP sites maintained by volunteers as well as public distribution by
postings on Usenet and the like.  True, the keys distributed in such a manner
are subject to alteration, but so what?  If some elaborate spoofing mechanism
*were* in place, I seriously doubt that the secrecy of its existence would be
allowed to be compromised by routine alteration of *widely dessiminated*
information.  My point is that it is one thing to spoof private communications,
but it is quite another to spoof an entire network in such a way that the
spoofee is guaranteed to be fooled.

By posting your public key here, running it in the New York times, trademarking
it or even tatooing it on your forehead you make it hard to fool everyone...
(But be sure to leave room on your forehead for new keys)

All you have to do is occassionally verify through an unpredictable third party
that the various postings of your public key are uncorrupted.

Likewise, as a recipient of encrypted messages it is prudent to periodically
check the public key postings/archives for alterations.  Again, this is meaning
-
less (to you, at least) unless done through an unpredictable third party.  And
of course you would want to check a large number of keys through the third part
y,
not just the particular key you are interested in (to prevent selective spoofin
g
of all individuals interested in a particular key.)

If this degree of security were insufficient for me, I would tend to worry more
about burglars and the like, rather than global conspiracies.  Security of the
*private* key looks to me like the weakest link.

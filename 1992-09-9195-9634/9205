The article "Pseudorandom Bit Generators in Stream-Cipher
Cryptography" by Zeng et al., Computer, Feb. 1991, says:
   "[T]he only practical way to certify a generator for use in
   communication protection is to subject it to merciless
   mocking attacks." (p. 16)
Surely this is an allusion to sci.crypt.  :-)

-> What the PGP docs should say is that you don't need to keep your
-> public key _confidential_.
 
It DOES say so. The manually explicitely states that you should share your 
public key with as many people/systems as possible. What you _should_ keep 
confidential is your private key.
There could have been a problem with pgp 1.0 when keys could not be 
certified. That way it'd be easy for anyone to forge a key on your user-ID 
and sit in the middle of communications. PGP 2.0 features this 
key-certification and is thus a lot stronger regarding to key-security 
than the 1.0 version.

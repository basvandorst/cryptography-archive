Not in the U.S.  Conspiracy is when you meet with someone else and
agree to commit a crime.  In some cases, you also have to take steps
towards actually carrying out what you conspired to do.  But I can get
together with a friend and conspire to meet him at McDonald's for
lunch, because meeting at McDonald's for lunch isn't a crime.

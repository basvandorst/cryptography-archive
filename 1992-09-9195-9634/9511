Set up ten keys. Require that at least three of them cooperate in order
to change another one. Use just one of them for normal communications.
End of problem.

There is a network called MagNet (TM). Anyone connected to MagNet can
send a message to everyone else connected to MagNet. Messages do not, by
default, come with any indication of their origin. If you look at MagNet
messages you'll see some signed with public keys. Only the creator of a
key (by which I mean to include the actual person who generated the key,
and anyone he's cooperating with) can sign messages with that key. If
you see two messages on MagNet signed by the same key, you can assume
that they were both sent by the creator of that key.

Certainly there is nothing to say ``who'' the creator of a key ``really
is,'' even if the concept of ``who'' makes sense. Keys are not
``validated'' in any way. RSADSI would have a fit if it knew about
MagNet. Nevertheless MagNet is secure.

I agree with your remark. Nevertheless, I am willing to provide the
possibility to anyone to attack whatever s/he wishes. Just tell me
what you want - to send me a lot of files, which I'll encrypt with a
secret password and provide the archive(s), to create a file myself,
encrypted with a secret password, use PKZIP or Info-ZIP - please
specify. If anybody wants to send me file, please upload them to

	ftp.informatik.uni-hamburg.de:pub/virus/incoming

and send me e-mail, describing what you have uploaded and what should
I do with it. The resulting archives will be available for download
from

	ftp.informatik.uni-hamburg.de:pub/virus/zipcontest

However, there will be no prize for this contest, sorry. :-) Except
the fame, of course...

Please do so. Will the new zip (compiled with the patched zcrypt)
produce encrypted archive, extractable by unzip compiled with the old
zcrypt?

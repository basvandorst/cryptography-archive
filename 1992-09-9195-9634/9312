Hi.

I had to remove the version of PGP 2.0 because the version from
ghost.dsi (which I had uploaded) had problems.  I have now retrieved
the zip file from nic.funet.fi and removed the carriage returns with a
shell script of my own devising.  Now, PGP 2.0 is available from
ftp.uni-kl.de again as

	pub/atari/incoming/pgp20src.zip		(unmodified from funet)
	pub/atari/incoming/pgp-2.0.tar.Z	(CRs removed, UNIX format)

I'm sorry I created such a confusion but I didn't know that the
distribution was somehow screwed up.

Have fun.

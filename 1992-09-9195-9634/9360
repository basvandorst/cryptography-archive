Yes, he has used non-printable characters. It's obvious, if you read
carefully the docs... Just the fact that he wants the participants of
the contest to submit the password in hex should be telling
enough... :-) My guess is that he has used a randomly generated
7-character password of the full 8-bit alphabet. Of course, you could
check the passwords with length 0-6, but I bet that you won't find one
there...

Is your program available? I am asking, because I am just about to
write a portable zip cracker myself... Using your own code from the
Info-ZIP, BTW... :-) Not to win the contest, but to provide a tool to
the people who want to check how good is the password they are using.
A tool like Crack and CBW. With user-supplied dictionaries, and all
that jazz... If you have already done it, and if your program is
available, it will safe me the duplicated effort.

Not quite correct. It's true that he used a "stored" file on purpose,
but it is not true that the file is not compressible. The archive is
not produced by a plain vanilla PKZIP 1.10. Phil has used a special
utility to create it, and has instructed it not to compress the file.

Is this true for 1.93 alpha as well? I.e., does version 1.93 store
only one byte checksum of the password?

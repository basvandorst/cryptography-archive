Ha die John, Cor hier :) (that was a bit of dutch :)
Well, john, you trust me right? (on some matters)
At least you know *I* am not an NSA spy :)
Maybe it was just a bit of sarcasm , but I know branko lankester
personally. Pretty good even...I just talked to him this afternoon.
He is not an NSA spy, he is a student at UVA like me.
(no , not the one in virginia :)
He worked VERY hard making PGP2.0 , and I even feel (hope branko
wont mind me saying this) that he didnt get the credits he deserved.
But thats all personal opinion. Branko didnt have any say in that.
I hope you werent serious about distrusting branko , cause
he is what made pgp2.0 possible, and NOT the nsa. 
And, I worked on PGP2.0 too...the amiga version, did you know that?
Does that mean im an NSA spy too?

btw..to anyone reading this..someone please make an amiga binary
and email me. I had a HD crash and am unable to make one :(

Not relating specifically to this subject, but along the lines of passwords
and security...

Many system (almost all) provide a facility for the user's password to expire
after a certain amount of time and then require a new password. What is
the 'official' rationale concerning this practice?

I assume the main brunt of the argument states that this somehow makes it
harder for an attacker to guess a password.

My own feeling is that at best it does nothing to deter intruders, and at
worst it helps them.

The weak case is that it is nothing of a help. This is because to an intruder
coming apon a system at a random point in time the set of all the present
passwords is no more or less crackable if they are a set of non-expiring
passwords than if they are a set of expiring passwords. What reasoning
would argue the expiring set is inherantly less crackable? The amount
of time a hacker spends at one site is surely an order of magnitude less
than the cycle time of individual passwords; even if it is comparable,
it seems unlikely that passwords shifting during the course of his attack
would have any effect on the crackability of the system.

The strong case is that a set of expiring passwords is in fact _more_
crackable than a set of static passwords. When people are forced to change
their password at intervals they very quickly lose patience trying to
think of obscure, hard-to-remember (and crack) passwords and shift
to a more simple, easier-to-remember (and crack) type of password. I myself
have ended up using passwords of the form "passwordone", "passwordtwo",
"passwordthree" where the root part ("password") is static and the trailing
word is just enough to fool the system into thinking I've really selected
a new password.

Users will (may) select an obscure and hard to crack password like OLI77YT
if they know they only have to memorize it once and never have to change
it. If every two weeks they are supposed to memorize some new monstrosity
of nonsense and gobble (which is what most "traditional" sites seem to be
advising) they will (in my opinion) abondon that and fall back into a
simpler class of passwords. Systems which keep a history and phrohibit
reusing passwords often keep a record of the last three or so used. I have
found myself (and I am a reasonably sophisticated computer user, I am
a programmer and have been using computers since I could read [almost:-] )
setting up a cycle of simple passwords in such environments of length one
larger than the history mechanism.

The whole issue is compounded when a user finds themselves on many systems.
Expecting them to memorize a new password when each of 3 non-synchronized
expire counters for 3 different systems runs up is asking for trouble. How
long can you keep memorizing babble when the mean time between memorization
is dropping to 5 or 7 days? Which babble goes with which machine? Two
'solutions' I suspect most people use is to use the same (small set of)
password(s) on all machines or to include a reference to the name of the
machine in the password, possibly concatenated to some simple, poor
password shard. (Ex: "WORKpassword", "HOMEpassword", and "BBSpassword" where
"WORK", "HOME", and "BBS" are perversions of the machine name, and "password"
is a static bit which is used on all machines).

So can anyone comment on my thoughts or offer some other reasoning to
support this practice?

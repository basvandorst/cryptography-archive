Uh, read your first line. You have the source- change the Sboxes to your
heart's content. Double, triple, qudruple encrypt with different keys,
and different permutations. If NSA had really wanted to make sure you
couldn't use anything but their weak(???) DES, they would never have
agreed to release the details of DES for you to change them.

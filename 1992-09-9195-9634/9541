 Perhaps I *am* naive to promote the phone system as an alternate
 channel.  But it seems to me that spoofing the phone system, with
 real-time audio, in addition to spoofing the data, *must* be much
 more difficult than simply spoofing data in packets with little
 or no time pressure.  It becomes even more difficult if the parties
 know each other.  The point of this is to increase the cost of
 penetration.

 I agree.

 A good cryptosystem must require a significant effort to penetrate
 *each message*.  When there exists an approach which allows security
 to be penetrated at low cost (after some initial investment in
 analysis or machinery), we call that system "broken."  The use of
 unvalidated public keys is the use of a broken system.

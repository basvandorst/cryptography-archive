     I found it pretty amusing that the tiger team would use a cordless
telephone system in their own office -- they ought to (& in real life,
probably would) know better...
 
  The long-range audio monitoring when they were surveilling the 'toy
company' also seemed rather far-fetched, especially seeing as though they
weren't using any sophisticated filtering & ampliphication systems.
 
   A high-security building such as the 'toy company' wouldn't have open
access in the ceiling crawl spaces, especially if some of the rooms were
designed to meet TEMPEST requirements.
 
   Finally, they (the tiger team) had already decided that there office area
was compromised, & as such, being there posed a risk to their lives, so I
don't understand why they went back there at the end (especially with the
gizmo...).
 
    I'd also question whether some of the systems they acessed (power grid,
FAA ARTCC system, etc.) actually allow POTS dialups, and I have a bunch of
questions about the magic box, but I suppose the movie could have been a lot
worse, & all in all, I enjoyed it!

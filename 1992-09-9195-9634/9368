So you do a checksum on the most recent entry in /tmp ( or all of them),
or a random selection of files  from /tmp or anywhere else that changes
frequently (/.history maybe), or seed a random number generator to
choose which of the possibilities to use to generate your random number.
As always the best idea is to keep em guessing, change the 'random' number
source frequently, and don't publish your technique in sci.crypt.

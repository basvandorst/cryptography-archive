You and your friend Alice get together and sign each others keys in
person. Later, Bob sends you a key of his, signed by Alice. Since you
know Alice's key to be valid, you suspect that Bob's is. This way, a
small number of people you trust can validate a large number of other
people who you can't meet in person.

I'd just read the manual. Most questions are answered.

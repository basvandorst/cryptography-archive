Wrong. Provision against altering the contents is not enough.  The
opponent must be unable to impersonate your friend.  That means (1) he
is unable to insert messages (different and more restrictive than
altering) or (2) you must have some way to test the authorship of
messages.

Consider case (1): If an opponent can't insert messages, then this
channel is functionally equivalent to the case in which you, your
friend, and your opponent all posses each other's public keys, and you
and your friend are the only ones who know your respective private
keys.  (*NOTE* I did *NOT* say that the only way to have an insertion
proof channel was public key encryption.  What I said was that any
insertion proof channel is functionally equivalent to the above public
key channel.)  Conclusion from case (1): Any channel which can protect
against insertion is equivalent to a secure PK channel.

Now consider case (2):  If an opponent can't impersonate your friend,
then this channel is functionally equivalent to the case in which you
and your friend each have the ability to validate each other's digital
signatures, and only you and your friend have the ability to generate
your respective digital signatures. Digital signatures are an encryption
technique, based on public key cryptography, and can be converted back into 
a conventional (if inefficient) public key encryption channelend users
such as you and your frie

way to test that your friend authored a message, then that mechanism
is essentially *equivalent* to a public key encryption mechanism (no,
I didn't say it *was* public key, I just said that it could be used in
the same way), and hence any channel which allows you to distribute a
key is neccesarily a channel which is secure.

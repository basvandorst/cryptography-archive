Hello there;

	If any of you have knowledge about how to solve these
problems,Please help.Prompt response will be appriciated.Is there
any program wriitten in C for following problem and available in
public domain?

Thanks in advance.

General knapsack is a problem where Let w=[w_1,w_,..w_n] denote a sequence
of weights. The cryptogram y corresponding to a binary message block x of
length n is given by  y=x_1w_1+x_w_2+..+x_nw_n. (a_i is a with index i).
Conversely given an integer y<w_1+w_2..w_n, a plaintext x corresponding
to y is a binary block of length n that satisfies  y=x_1w_1+x_w_2+..+x_nw_n.


1)
I need to write a program for encryption/decryption using general knapsack.
(Note that using the terms encryption/decryption should be interpreted
as finding the value of a one-way function and its inverse in this case.)
The program reads a file containing the length and weight of w and
also a plaintext (or ciphertext) file where plaintext is a text file
and ciphertext contains only lower case alphabet letters. The output
is the encrypted (decrypted) message. The program should record the
number of operations it has performed in each run and print together
with the result. In general you might have more than one solution for
a cryptogram.  The program should find all of these and store them in
a file.

2)
Also I need to Implement Merkle-Hellman (MH) public key cryptosystem (PKC).
The encryption stage (transmitter) reads the public key (a vector
of weights) for a user and encrypt the plaintext accordingly. 
In decryption (receiver) the program reads a superincreasing weight 
vector, a multiplier r and modulus m, finds r^{-1} (inverse of r), 
and use it to decrypt a cryptogram that is received (stored in a file).
Again the number of operation in encryption/decryption is recorded 
and printed.

Thankyou very much.

I am greatly enjoying this discussion of vulnerabilities of public key encryption systems.

I have two requests that I think will help all of us enjoy them more and make it far 
easier to both follow the discussion and to get something useful accomplished.

First, as the primary topic of discussion shifts, would the poster who changes the
direction *please* change the subject line to be something meaningful *AND* leave
the old subject in the Subject line (in parentheses, at the end, after the word "Was").
You know, the standard Usenet way of handling multi-threaded conversations.

Second, could we (begin to) develop a set of "standard procedures" for using public
key encryption.  This would entail someone, like Terry, who wants to identify a particular
vulnerability, publishing a detailed transaction (I do this, you do that).  Some (much)
of this is already available in various published papers, but I have never seen a FAQ
that tells people (*me!*) where to get an electronic copy of them.  If we will all do
this, the end result will be a set of procedures with known residual vulnerabilities
that people can actually use.  Who knows, it may even develop into workable public
domain software.  (You mean, we could actually influence how things happen?  Yup.)

As I try to follow the current discussion, I feel somewhat handicapped by not having
in front of me a copy of the exact security protocol exchange that is being discussed.
Hey, Terry, would you please, *pretty please with sugar on it*, publish one?

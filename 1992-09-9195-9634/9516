Well, first off, I'd like you to present a nice key (NOT MINE!!):

-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
Version: 2.0 !!! This is a hacked key !!!

I tested this and the !!!'s don't seem to bother PGP at all. Then,
keep in mind that this obviously no-good person Harry has an invalid
Email address. Also, messages encrypted with this public key cannot be
read by me but only by Phil (and maybe the NSA ;). Also, this
shouldn't be considered as an insult to anyone. (special apologies to
everyone called Harry :-)

So, what does this prove? Only that it is very easy to get someone
else's public key and put another name on it. What one could do with
this besides causing confusion I don't know.

This can "easily" be prevented by signing your own key. When adding
such a key to your key ring PGP doesn't even get upset about the
unknown signature. So why couldn't this be made the standard? Were the
additional 20-odd bytes not worth it? And yes, I know, a signature on
that key from someone else that you _do_ trust is much much better,
but there are currently a lot of keys floating around without any
signatures.

Note that if you add this key to your key ring (try it, you can easily
remove it using "pgp -kr Hackery" and then answering No, Yes in that
order), and then type "pgp -kvv" to check your keys, it is completely
unclear what was signed by Branko and what not. If you type "pgp -kc"
it becomes a bit clearer. This only adds in the confusion. (Note that
Branko's key is now supposedly signed by Harry).


Then, something else: I can disadvise you of trying to remove your own
public key from your keyring. PGP won't trust your own key when you
re-insert it. However, I was finally able to restore that using the
various available switches. Oh, talking about switches, the -f switch
doesn't always work as expected, but I believe that has been mentioned
before (in MSDOS I'd like to "pgp -fka < con" and then clipboard
something over from news or mail).

Minor bug: PGP leaves various temporary files behind (at least on
MSDOS, and they look like *.$00) when processing ascii-armored files.


And finally: An OPEN LETTER to Philip Zimmermann.

  Phil,
  
  I know you have been forced by law not to have anything to do with
  PGP 2.0, but, apparently, it's no problem putting your key in the
  distribution package.

  Now, for the mental sake of all those who are Incurably Paranoid,
  would you be so kind as to post or otherwise make public a signature
  for your PGP 2.0 key as distributed, signed using PGP 1.0 and with
  your PGP 1.0 key! (I know PGP 1.0 was "good" because the NSA thought
  it was "bad" ;)

  Thereby solemny declaring that your PGP 2.0 key is used in a proper
  way and Branko Lankester isn't really the NSA spy that my Paranoia
  makes me think he is and that PGP 2.0 isn't filled with loopholes
  carefully planted there by the NSA, spreading your name throughout
  the docs to make it look real.
  
  Sincerely,

-- Jan-Pieter

PS. Yes, this is my real key now.
PPS. No, I didn't sign it like I suggested, so it is very well
     possible that some spoofing smart-arse put some additional silly
     IDs in my key, like maybe "JohnPC" or something, which would seem
     like a nice pun based on my first name and initials ;-)
PPPS. Hmm...  it might be possible that, if Phil does post this
      signature of his key as I suggested, that this would still be an
      NSA froud, as they stole Phil's private key. Well, in that case
      I can only say that Orwell was less than 10 years off (double
      plus ungood thought ;)

 First, if you mean *phoning* the distant site and verifying the
 key verbally, I think this can be made to work.

 However, I suspect that you instead meant the use of *email* from
 intermediate sites to "confirm" the key.  But multiple sites
 provide advantage only to the extent that they are logically
 "independent."  And this is only partly true:  Ultimately, they
 all got the key from the same place, and they all send it to the
 same place.  This means that a single subverted node at either end
 would eliminate any supposed advantage of multiple message paths.

 Similarly, any single node through which all messages happened
 to pass would also eliminate the advantage (note that routing
 software would tend to route messages similarly, close to their
 origin or destination).  And if most of the network was
 subverted, different message paths could hardly matter.

 I guess if we want to talk about the "difficulty" of all this,
 I would compare it to the mail or news programs themselves;
 difficult, yes, but not unbelievably so.  Once such a program
 is done, it is only necessary to distribute it subvertly, or
 in some plausible way get it installed on many systems (major
 mail channels first, of course).  Possibly it could be
 distributed as a Trojan, or as a worm or virus.  The guys or
 gals doing all this would be pros; the stuff would work.

 But I would guess that a serious request from your government
 would probably suffice to get the program installed in 80-90%
 of the major cases, wouldn't you?  They wouldn't say what they
 were really doing of course; there would be some other plausible
 cover story (and they might not even really *be* the government).
 For extreme cases the Opponent could buy a computer company (or
 part of one), supply new equipment or operators, buy the company
 owning the troublesome node, compromise the existing operators,
 put in their own new node and volunteer to handle most of the
 traffic, or whatever else works.

 Frankly, I think the "difficulty" of all this could be comparable
 to conventional intelligence activities which are funded as a
 matter of course.  Maybe "they" could even think of a way to make
 all this turn a profit.  Costs would be mostly front-end; once the
 system was set up, "per-intercept" costs could be almost zero.

 Note that we normally do not use probabilities to describe the
 situation where the Opponent merely needs to use their assumed
 resources in order to gain access to sensitive information.
 Normally we call such a cipher "broken."  In this case the
 problem is in key distribution (instead of the cipher proper)
 but the result is the same.

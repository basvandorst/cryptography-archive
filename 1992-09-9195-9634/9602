Here is a Mathematica function to crack an RSA public key consisting of
the public modulus n ("the big number", as you call it) and the public
exponent e:

crackRSA[publicKey[e_,n_]] :=
  Block[ { factors = FactorInteger[n], p, q },
    p = factors[[1,1]]; q = factors[[2,1]];
    PowerMod[e, -1, (p - 1) (q - 1)]
  ]

p and q are the two prime factors of n.  The function returns the secret
(private) exponent d which is the multiplicative inverse of e in the
finite field of numbers in the range [0,(p-1)(q-1)-1].  (I have never
tried it for moduli n which have more than about 20 digits ... )

Check out any good book on modern cryptography or chapter 33 of
"Introduction to Algorithms" by Cormen, Leiserson and Rivest
for the number theoretical background.

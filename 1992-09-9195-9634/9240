Yes, IDEA has a 128 bit key.  It's rather beautiful algorithm,
involving multiplications mod 65537 (which is prime, so the
multiplications are invertible because every number (except zero) has
an inverse mod a prime), additions mod 65536, and XORs.  These
operations are combined in a network which thoroughly scrambles the
data.  There are no table lookups or bit permutations at all.

It's described in the proceedings of EUROCRYPT '91 (at least I think
it was that one, but I haven't got a copy here).

BAD NEWS: It's PATENTED.  Not just in the USA but in Europe as well.
If enforced, this patent will probably prevent the widespread adoption
of this algorithm.  A great shame.

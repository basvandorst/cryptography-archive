        Has anyone compiled the MD5 source into an MSDOS binary?

        I've been trying it out with Zortech C++ small model but the
        results I get aren't the same as the test case. Detailed
        examination of the source hasn't given me any clues.

        Any suggestions, or a pointer to a source for the successfully
        compiled binary would be deeply appreciated.

           ,Marc

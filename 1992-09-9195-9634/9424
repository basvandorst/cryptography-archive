Was this supposed to be a voice-stress analyzer? That'd be great -- yet
another instance of supposedly credible people believing that such
technology can actually detech "deception," while in fact no one has
ever been able to prove such things work. Many scientists claim voice-
stress analyzers are even less reliable than the polygraph, which 
the Congress banned for nongovernmental use.

Of course, none of this stopped the voice-stress analyzer from being
used on Anita Hill by some well-meaning people, or the polygraph
on Woody Allen by his lawyers (?).

How would I go about this.  I put my public key in my .plan, but shortly after,
I fingered myself from a different system and noticed that none of my .plan or
.project information is sent.  I think it might be because this is my school's
system and they might want to protect students..  Anyone know some tricks to
override this?
adv(tnx)ance,
Ian Nelson

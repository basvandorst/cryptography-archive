    Not key-compatible, i.e., you can't use your old keys & keyrings
with the new version, and there is no conversion utility.  You've got to
redo your keyrings from the ground up.
    This was intentional.  The idea is that with the new keyring
management features, you will more or less automatically build a good
level of security in the right way -- the FIRST time.

And who gets to decide precisely what those "non-commercial" purposes
are? If I work at a for-profit organization, and my buddy works at
another for-profit organization, and we exchange RSA-encrypted email
of a personal nature, is that "commercial" or "non-commercial"? One
would assume that it's non-commercial, and thus we're allowed to use
RSA without a fee. But is it? Exchanging personal email using my
employer's computers and networks makes me happier, and thus makes me
work harder for my employer, and thus my employer makes more money,
presumably more than the cost of transmitting the actual email
message. This non-commercial exchange had, as a result, financial gain
for my employer. So, is this commercial or non-commercial use of RSA?

Now, the email exchanged is encrypted, and, for the sake of argument,
we'll assume that our keys are long enought that it will take several
centuries for the various three-letter agencies to decrypt it. So
rather than exchange gossip, we could actually be exchanging
information of a commercial nature. So long as the fifth amendment
holds and noone can force me to reveal my secret key, noone can
actually prove whether the contents of my message were indeed
personal.

Now, does anything change if either or both parties work for
non-profit organizations? How about government organizations? How
about if one of the parties in not in the US?

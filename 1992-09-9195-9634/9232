   I have posted my notes on cryptography to sci.math.  They are slightly
revised from the version about 8 months ago (one new short section on
1989 results on pseudo-random number generators).  The notes include an
exposition of the Goldwasser-Micali papers on probabilistic encryption
of 1982 and 1984.

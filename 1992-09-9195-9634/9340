So, how do blind people use this keypad?

The challenge is not to create such a device at all, but to create one
that is (1) secure, (2) cost-effective, and (3) can be used by people
with disabilities (because of the Americans With Disabilities Act, the
latter is now _legally required_, not just a "nice extra").

Disabilities include but are not limited to:

- blindness (braille or fixed-entry format required)
- sight-imparied (braille not ok, requires high-contrast, large characters,
	wide range of sight angles, etc.)
- may be in a wheelchair
- etc.

Oh, yes, you also can't just have a closed booth that people go into.
That would create a security hazard (both for the money and the people
inside).

Hi,

I'd like to use pgp2.0 to sign UseNet messages and mail so that

 (1). *everybody* can read my postings/mails (even without pgp) and 
 (2). those who do have it can also check the signature.

My problem is that ``pgp -s text'' adds the signature in 'binary' form so that
I can't send the resulting ``text.pgp'' as ordinary mail (although the original
text is unchanged, satisfying (1) ). On the other hand: If I use ``pgp -sa text''
the resulting ``text.asc'' is pure ASCII (satisfying (2)), but the receiver
needs pgp to convert the base64 representation (of signature _and_ text)
into the original text again.

So:  Is there any pgp option which allows me to sign a text file with the signature
in base64 representation and the message body unchanged? I know that I can generate 
a signature in a separate file using ``pgp -bsa text'' and then include the resulting 
signature ``text.asc'' in my mail, but this way the receiver must separate signature
and message body into two files to have pgp check it. Is there a ``standard''
way to have pgp do this directly?

Thanks in advance, Wolfgang <wwe@aifb.uni-karlsruhe.de>

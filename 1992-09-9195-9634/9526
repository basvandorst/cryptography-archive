I am interested in historic ciphers (i.e. Beale, others, etc) as a hobby.{


The .mil connection is solely as a biomedical science officer at
USAF Hospital at Hill AFB, for those conspiracy-minded folks...

I am trying to track down letter frequency tables for a French
document that was encrypted using the Rosicrucian (pigpen) cipher.
Not knowing how the encipherer setup the tables, I am turning to
frequency analysis of the cipher-text.  Jean-loup has suggested
constructing my own from ftp.inria.fr, but I am fundamentally lazy,
and would like to avoid the work if any of you have access to ready
made tables.

I am also willing to provide substantial files and analyses of the
Beale cipher for anyone interested.  I would be happy to upload the
cipher-text files to any ftp site that someone could suggest.

Dave

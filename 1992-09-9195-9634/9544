 There are various aspects of "security" in a computer system.  I
 can certainly agree that an open agency is "more trustworthy" in
 the sense of being managed in a "more responsible" way or "more
 sensitive to invasion of privacy," but we were discussing
 *cryptographic security* and public keys.

 "Public" key technology is *not* "open."  "Public" keys consist of
 *two* key values, and only one of these is open.  The other is a
 highly sensitive cryptographic object and must be kept absolutely
 secret.  Upon this secret hangs the ability to "sign" messages.
 When anyone who might have had access to that object moves on,
 the object should be changed; the keys should be changed.  If the
 keys are not changed, the agency is *not* "more trustworthy" in
 the cryptographic sense.  It seems obvious to me that an "open"
 agency with greater computer access and more turnover must have
 far more difficulty retaining a particular secret key than a
 "closed" agency would have.

 Multiple agencies really do increase *reliability* (if we can get
 the same information from any of them).  Multiple agencies with
 similar security levels REALLY DO NOT increase security, because
 the effort it takes to penetrate one is roughly equivalent to the
 effort it takes to penetrate another.  Normally we do not consider
 an additional 1x investment to be a cryptographic security multiplier.


>I stand behind the Multiple ACLU's idea.

 I suggest that "Multiple ACLU's" offers security which is far
 inferior to separate-channel validation (which is itself imperfect).

I recently obtainted the faq from rsa.com, but the postscript file seems
messed up.  When viewed with DEC's dxpsview utility (DECstation 3100,
Ultrix), I first get an error message about no enough memory, then
dxpsview hangs when I try to view the next page.

If sent to an HP laserjet with PacificPage cartridge, I get the title
page and table of contents, then the printer hangs.  The title page
in two places has characters overprinted (the "k" and "e" of "Asked"
and the "h" and "y" of "Cryptography"), and it looks like the file
was actually generated this way, suggesting a bad run of TeX to
PostScript.

Has anybody gotten their .ps file to print/view correctly?

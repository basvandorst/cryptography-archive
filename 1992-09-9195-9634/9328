 Sometime in the early hours of last night I had this  horrible thought. Does
anyone really use these encrypted e-mail products that we've been 
developing besides us?  I mean, we as interested information security
people sometimes use it (why I don't know except perhaps as an experiment)
but how many commercial outfits are using it I wonder?  These are the
people who supposedly needed it and yet my experience as a security 
analyst (based on what I see in the field) tell me that only a few more
advanced type are going to go throught the trouble of setting it all up for 
commercial use. Now, maybe, in a brighter world when business is conducted 
through the paperless office, when we are all online and have pre-stored 
certificates in some X.500 directory, we then might see some usage. 
But until that happy hour, I'd not be overly surprised to find the number 
of organizations using encrypted e-mail to be small indeed. 


BTW -- Can someone post the algorithm or some write-up on the IDEA algorithm
that PGP 2.0 is using. I know its patented (another drag on commercial usage)
but can't it be posted?

Quite true - I know of only two cases where the crook actually went to the
trouble of building a phony ATM machine - one in New York City and
one in Italy.   

I've seen other cases where the crooks took a much simpler
approach to robbing the ATM - namely they planted dynamite and tried to
blow the machine up!!  There was a case in my old home town, and the crooks
failed, because they didn't use enough dynamite - the armor plating on the
machine survived the blast.

This is the traditional problem.  The defender must find and close all
holes into the system.  The attacker need only find one hole and exploit
it.  (Or in the case above, create the hole with dynamite!)

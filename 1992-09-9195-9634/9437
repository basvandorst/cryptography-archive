Correct. I think two files encrypted with the same password would have
been more realistic however. The special check does allow for rapid
password checking which is IMO the weakest part of the PKZIP scheme.

The scheme Peter Gutmann uses in HPACK (something like simple unpatentable
...) adresses this problem in an interesting way althought I think
even better ways should be possible. A simple one would be
to preprocess the password always with 1000 MD5 scrambles.

Yes. But mostly one means with those characters like &^$*&. Meaning
not passwords like "hello" should be used but more like "hel#4O23:".
In the contest case however non ASCII characters can be used as well
and that is quite unrealistic in DOS (many environments don't even
allow it).

I don't like contests like these at all. I think the fact there exist
cracking programs and that those often work on real life ZIP files
prove enough. No contest can match that.

Maybe. I believe a pack of well designed rules (like time needed
to check a try password etc) might be usefull as well.

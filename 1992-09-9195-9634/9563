Some questions:

Is differential cryptanalysis exclusively applicable to situations
where a chosen plaintext attack is possible?

If so, does the use of a random header followed by encryption in a
chaining mode defeat such an attack?

Finally, is vulnerability to differential cryptanalysis (or indeed
chosen plaintext attacks in general) believed to imply vulnerability
to other types of attack?

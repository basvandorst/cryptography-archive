It took me a while, but I finally decoded it. It cost millions of dollars in 
research money to get me up there so many times.

When one looks at the Earth from space, the messages are constant across the
image. Watch the traveling clouds and storms.

endurance in nuclear war.

For a more complete list of the messages, drop me a line.

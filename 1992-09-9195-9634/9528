Let me just say, Terry, that I think you're wrong on all counts.  An open
agency can operate a MORE trustworthy computer system than a closed one,
because all of the procedures are public and can be monitored.  Multiple
agencies REALLY DO increase security, especially if they use distict,
separately derived security systems, because virtually all of the failure 
modes will be independent.

I stand behind the Multiple ACLU's idea.

I am fairly new to this forum, but I have not seen anyone talk
of the problems that "memo-post" ATM machines cause to security.
I have worked for banks on and off for many years.  A few years 
ago, I had access to the code which handled the communications 
with the ATMs for a large bank.  I was shocked to find that 
no matter which ATM (ours or another bank's) was the source of 
the transaction, the key used to decrypt was constant.

I was told this was necessary since all the machines in this 
net (a national net) could operate in "memo-post" mode when 
their connection with the host was broken.  They needed to be
able to validate the PIN locally without regard to the home 
bank which issued the card.  Not only did they all use the 
same key, but it was a very simple one.  

At the time, I worried about someone getting a reader (now very 
cheap) and reading stolen cards to get the PIN.  I guess the 
fact that losses are small makes this acceptable.

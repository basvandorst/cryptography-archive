Okay, folks -- so how exactly would you go about breaking a
polyalphabetic substitution cipher with a fixed key?

For example, the famous challenge cipher submitted to Edgar Allan Poe
with the key "United States" (the ciphertext had a couple of critical
errors in it, as I remember, which might have been what defeated Poe);
how would you go about deciphering something encoded in this manner?

What if the key was some nonsense string, e.g. "Xr@5T0 v4G+9E"?

Obviously if the key length = the length of the cleartext, you've got
a Vernam cipher ("one-time pad"), especially if the key is randomly
selected.

And how confident would any of you folks be about breaking a
doubly-encrypted polyalphabetic Ceasarian cipher rendered, not in
ASCII, but in five years or so when the Unicode standard is
(hopefully) put into practice?  (Unicode, for those who haven't heard
of it yet, is an attempt to render most of the thousands of characters
used in the world's many alphabets using 16-bit representations,
rather than the seven employed by standard ASCII.  This would provide
2^16 or 65536 characters to work from, including the ISO-Latin sets,
Devanagari, Thai, Bengali, Arabic, Korean, Katakana/Hiragana, Chinese
ideographs, and several others.)

I've written some code for producing what seems to me to be a pretty
nasty polyalphabetic cipher -- I know that most ciphers short of RSA
with 170-digit factors, DES with at least a 90-bit key, or some of the
nastier knapsack subset-sum variants are supposed to be vulnerable to
attack, but I don't understand how this is done.

Anyone willing to shed some light on this?


BTW, I was kind of irritated by _Sneakers_, even if Len Adelman was
(too briefly) consulted by the filmmakers.  Didn't he tell them what
it would mean if somebody found a super-algorithm to solve a
(supposedly) NP-complete problem in polynomial time?  Since all the
NP-complete problems can be reduced to the same problem, any algorithm
that solved one could thus be modified to solve them all, and there
would be no such thing as NP-completeness any more... this would be a
TREMENDOUS discovery, and cryptography would be the least of its many
ramifications... also, as Oppenheimer said, you can't put the djinn
back in the bottle; a scientific discovery, once made, can be made
again!

For this reason I haven't got much patience for the many, many book &
movie plots in which some evil organization tries to restrict the flow
of knowledge in some way by killing the brilliant scientist (who, of
course, told nobody of his work -- yeah right), or stealing/destroying
the SECRET FORMULA for whatever, or... well, you know the type.  It's
annoying, but, like someone on this newsgroup said earlier, there are
certain sacrifices that must be made for the sake of mass-market
entertainment... at least in some scientifically backward societies...
:-(.

Information is neither good nor evil!  It just is.

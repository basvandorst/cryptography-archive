Ahoy!

  This weekend on CNN's "Future Watch", there was a short news item about
a firm called Cryptologics.  The gist of the article is that Cryptologics
will be producing reference information CD-ROMs in encrypted form.  Then the
users of the database will pay to decrypt certain parts of the information
found on programmatic information searches.
  The news item said that the company was already working with Mead Data 
Central to bring out CD-ROM copies of the Lexis and Nexis information 
databases.  As time goes on, they expect to offer many other kinds of
libraries as well.

  Unfortunately, I missed the bulk of the article and didn't catch the 
location of the company.  If someone can point me in the right direction
to get information on this outfit, please drop me a note in the email!

Thanks much for your help!

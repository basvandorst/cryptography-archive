No.

For theoretical purposes, there exists an algorithm which tests p for
primality in time log^5 p. If the algorithm says ``it's prime'' for a
non-prime, then the generalized Riemann hypothesis is false.

Actually that algorithm isn't too slow in practice, but for practical
purposes what you really want to use is Morain's ECPP. ECPP gives you
a _proof_ that your number is prime, no assumptions necessary. Theory
doesn't guarantee that ECPP is polynomial-time, but that doesn't stop
it from being very, very fast.

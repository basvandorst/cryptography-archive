Subject: pgp2.0 - what is an appropriate key length?

To date, I have seen 8 public keys cross my path, and 7 of those have
been derived using a 1024 bit modulus.  (At least I think pgp reports the
modulus length, and not the individual prime's lengths.)  I, too, have
chosen to use a 1024 bit key, although the pgp and RSA documents state
that keys in the 500-600 bit range provide adequate security for the
individual.  (The RSA doc reserves 1000+ bits for special purpose keys,
such as those belonging to a trusted authenicator.)  Unfortunately,
decrypting a 1024 bit key often takes my poor overworked Unix-PC 5 minutes,
so using the shorter key would be a big win.  (512 bytes implies 1/8 the
decrypt time, right?)

Could someone who is knowledgeable about the current state of the art
with respect to factoring the product of two primes please comment on
what is an adequate length?  I believe a 512 bit modulus implies the
primes would each be in the ballpark of 77 decimal digits, which I
believe is a difficult, but not impossible factoring problem today.
I'll admit, I'm not well versed in this area, so I am looking for
someone to educate me.

The FAQ is good. It is not PURE advertising, but it can be seen
as a good corporate document to turn its technology clear to potential
customers. It cites other tech. for encription and digital signature
and compare them to RSA briefly.

It seems to me that the current contents of RSA archive center are
good documents, created to provide a better view of the public
of the RSA algorithms. They are also a clear attempt to bring 
atention to their product in the current DSS/DSA x RSA and others
controversy. I think this is a special kind of advertising, where
the company wins "simpathy" by providing some documents to the public,
and can include subtle propaganda in these documents.

Anyway, I recommend not only the FAQ but also the  PKCSs and the
Layman Guide to a Subset of ASN.1. The FAQ, of course, is INTRODUCTORY.


Cheers,

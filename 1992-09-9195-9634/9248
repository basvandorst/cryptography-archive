"Legal to use for noncommercial purposes in the United States (and maybe
Canada, I forget)."

RSAREF is an implementation of RSA for which one may obtain a license
from RSADSI.  (Actually, it would be nice if, now that RSA is available
under license anyway, they would just allow licensing of PGP under the
same terms, but that would make too much sense.)

(Oh, and I guess that patent holders of IDEA aren't as shortsighted as
PKP, so the legal cloud I mentioned doesn't seem to exist.  Who knows,
maybe it could get hacked into RIPEM.)

Patriotism is, in fact, the *first* refuge of the scoundrel.

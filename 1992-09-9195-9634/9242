It just shows that the current idea of an 'ATM card' is no good. We need
intelligent tokens and pretty damn fast. By 'intelligent token' I mean
a card that can be challenged by the computer of the bank. I've seen this
talked about in many books, so it's nothing new. What I would like to know
is that how soon such devices will be available? Will the patents on
public encryption prevent such devices for another 10 years?

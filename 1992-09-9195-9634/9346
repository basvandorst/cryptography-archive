Heck, they have one of these guarding the door to the main machine
room (dinosaur pen) at SUNY-Binghamton where I went for undergrad.

Last year, after instrument thefts, they got one for the musical
instrument room!

I can't imagine that these cost too much, they're really simple!

But remember: Banking losses due to fraud are dwarfed by banking
losses due to non-payment of debts.  Why should a bank spend ten
gazillion dollars to stop a million a year in thefts from ATMs, when
they could spend a mere zillion dollars on a good commercial loan
officer and get millions more?

(Note that a gazillion is 'much more than a zillion'.)

I would be very thankful if somebody can point to me any reference
where I can find the typical rates (in bits/sec) for computing hash
with MD4 or MD5 and then applying public key encryption/decryption
with RSA (or any other PKCS) on SUN4 - SLC type machine in software.
I am looking rates for 1kbyte data packets. Any hardware plateform
other than SUN will also do as I am looking for average figures for
generating digital signatures using PKCS.

What are the average (or claimed) speeds for computing MD4/MD5/RSA
using specialised hardware (such as Cylink CY1024 (?) public key
processor) chips? What is the state of art hardware for cryptology
these days?

Similarly, What are the comparable (to PKCS), DES computation speeds 
and if you know any reference please...

I am sorry if this issue has been discussed in the past on this 
news group. I just came to know about sci.crypt only five minutes ago
 
Thanks

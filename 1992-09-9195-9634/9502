Apparently the mathematical concepts that enable the box to convert Apple II 
object code
into Macintosh object code could be applied to other situations, converting 
English to French or plaintext to encrypted text. I asked one of the people 
who was giving the demo about this and he indicated that that was one area 
they were looking at.
I beleive he said that the intellegence community was interested intheproduct, 
but since it was several years ago, I can't accurately say what was said.

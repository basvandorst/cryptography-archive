Too easy to intercept, I suspect.  You don't want to put them all in one
place.  I think what we want is to have lots of FTP sites and mail-servers
willing to mail out keyrings to anyone who requests them.  The more the
merrier.

Oh, and I'm willing to arrange to meet anyone in the Cambridge area who wants
to exchange keys in person and have me sign his/her key.

170 digit factors?  No sir!  The most recent news I heard for a
general purpose factorization is some 116 digits.  Has anyone beaten
this?  DES, even with a 56 bit key, is still pretty strong.

A cipher is not secure unless it can withstand a chosen plaintext
attack, where an attacker provides the text to be encrypted.  The
method, the plaintext, and the ciphertext are all known; all that
remains is to find the key.

It is popular to argue whether chosen plaintext attacks using large
amounts of data represent a practical attack, or are only of
theoretical interest.

Inverting RSA is probably not NP-complete.  It would greatly increase
the confidence in public key cryptography if it were proved to be, but
it's not likely.

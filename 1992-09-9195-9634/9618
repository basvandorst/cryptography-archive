I've been thinking about this myself lately.  If you could rule out nasty
message altering sites, it might be easiest to just take a checksum of
of the message (sans header and pgp signature) and sign that.  If one is
truely interested in making sure the sender was "real", just take the
checksum of the message and check it against the signed result.  Not 100%
reliable, but then again, few things are.  But what you are really trying
to gain is "confidence" that the message is from who it says it is and this
method should be descent enough for USENET or other public forums.

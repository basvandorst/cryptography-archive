All true - this is why the smart ATM card needs its own keyboard
and on-board encryption device.  Then the bi-directional challenges
are fully encrypted, and a completely bogus machine cannot interfere.
What this means is something like a credit-card sized calculator.

Certainly the ATM cards typically in use today in the US are insufficient.
Some of the European smart cards are approaching what is required, but
the real issue is building a smartcard with a keyboard that can survive
in a person's wallet or purse or whatever and doesn't cost significantly
more than current mag-stripe ATM cards.   This is a major engineering
challenge to the power and packaging people!!

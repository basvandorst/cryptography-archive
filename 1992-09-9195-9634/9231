As was recently discussed here, secure exchange of public keys is in
general not possible without a secure channel.  This is because
although the keys do not need to be _confidentiality_ protected,
they very often need to be _integrity_ protected.

What the PGP docs should say is that you don't need to keep your
public key _confidential_.

For pronounceable passwords,                                                    
you might consider using a combination
of the MD5 (message digest) algorithm
coupled to one or more of my Moby Lexical
databases:
 
The Pronunciator database will give
you a comprehensive set of individual,
double, and longer phonemes tuples that
are, by definition, pronounceable (using
IPA and 150,000 real words and phrases
in English and adopted into English.)

The Part-of-Speech database would even
permit you to construct grammatically
correct "sentences" for passphrase
generation; the Moby Words database has 560,000
entries in English; good enough for a subsequent
comprehensive scan for stereotyped passwords
or phrases.

The MD5 Algorithm would then collapse the
password or phrase into a well-distributed
bit space that a salt cold be coalesced into
or a  key extracted from.

Although not an endorsement,
Eugene Spafford is in fact using Moby Words
in a similar Internet project;  the NSA
is a licensee of the Part-of-Speech database.

These databases are available world-wide,
with special consideration for educational
and research organizations.

The very latest issue of Scientific American (October 92) contains an
8 page article giving an introduction to quantum cryptography by
Charles H. Bennett, Gilles Brassard, and Artur K. Ekert.

Like most SA articles it is very well written, written for an audience
of non-experts who are scientifically facile. If you don't know
anything about quantum cryptography, you'll probably find it interesting.

The basic idea of quantum cryptography is to create a secure channel
and then transmit keys over the channel. The secure channel is created
by a bit of quantum magic having to do with detecting the polarization
of photons - I can send you a photon in one of four polarization
states, and only you can correctly detect which of the four states the
photon is - if someone else eavesdrops, we can tell.

I've got some questions - the method does not seem like a panacea.
They require a public channel for the two people to talk to each other
on, but you have the problem of authenticating that channel. They also
don't really explain the physics of how the quantum effect works (not
a very real complaint - it isn't a physics article, afterall).

Gack!  I recognize that code (turns bright red).  I actually ripped it out of
another program I've been working on and it seems to have lost something in
the translation.  The original line of code (before it got stuck into PGP) reads
(sound of dusty archives being searched):

    while( bufCount && \
	   ( theCh = buffer[ bufCount - 1 ] ) == ' ' || theCh == '\t' )
	   bufCount--;

Apologies to anyone who's been inconvenienced by this problem....

Peter.

Maybe you should ask this question in sci.math. I don't have the
knowledge to provide you an adequate answer, but I'll tell you the
following. The US government does allow the export of RSA-based
cryptosystems which are limited to use no more than 512-bit numbers.
Now, would you trust the US government? (Gee, some people who are
paranoid enough do not trust even DES and the US government does not
allow DES to be freely exported...)

Vesselin

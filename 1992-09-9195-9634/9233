Gil, I introduced Elliptic Curve Cryptosystems: see my paper "The Use
of Elliptic Curves in Cryptography" in CRYPTO '85, Springer LNCS #218.
There have been a number of other papers about them.  You might start
looking the in the proceedings of the the CRYPTO and EUROCRYPT
conferences.  You also might get in touch with Scott Vanstone
(savanstone@water.waterloo.edu) whose group at Waterloo actively works
in that area.  He has written a nice survey paper.

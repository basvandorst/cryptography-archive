Hello. I desperately would like to get a copy of PGP v2.0. My problem is
that I do not have an ability to FTP to one of the sites that has the code.

I am able to dialin anywhere, and can of course receive email.

Does anyone have PGP available without requiring FTP?? Or, would someone
be able to email PGP to me in pieces?

Much thanks.

 Yes.  I think that any completely-independent channel must
 complicate things terribly for a network spoofer.

 Well, yes and no.  Sure, you can get a key published (we will
 for the moment *assume* that government printers can get all the
 characters of a random key on paper correctly).  But you can't
 know how long the key will be valid.

 It seems to me that much of the confusion surrounding "public"
 keys is caused by forgetting that each "public" key is just one
 of a pair of keys, and that other key is highly private.  This
 means that it is vulnerable to disclosure.  A single security
 incident is sufficient to force a key change.  But the old key
 is still out there, and everyone who subsequently uses it may be
 compromised, and the infection can spread to you:

 If a spoofer is in place and is given access to the old
 (compromised) secret key, he or she may translate messages sent
 in that key to your new one, and even add text at will.  The
 added text may include a "new" public key ostensibly from your
 correspondent; in fact, it is from the spoofer.  This key is
 "signed" of course, in your current valid public key, but it is
 the key from the spoofer, not the correspondent.  So if you use
 that key, the spoofer has just gained access to both sides of the
 conversation.  And this happened just because someone used a
 published public key which was no longer valid; they did not
 validate the key for current use.

 Publication is no substitute for a current key validation.

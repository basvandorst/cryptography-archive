 I *like* it.

 But I don't think it solves our problem.  Not yet.

 The way I understand it, Ross proposes to hide a small amount of
 data in normal text by hashing 40-byte blocks into a single bit
 using a secret key.  During text construction, the text editor
 would "beep" if a just-created block did not produce the correct
 bit; in that case the user would back up and try again with
 different words.

 The advantage is that we can get a hidden secret message past
 the Opponent because the outer message looks innocuous.  Then,
 once everybody has the message, we just announce the secret key
 and everyone can unlock the hidden data (the validated public key).

 Unfortunately, if the Opponent sees such an announcement, the
 announcement may be gobbled, in which case nobody knows about the
 "validated" key except the originator and the Opponent.  Then the
 Opponent can create a similar message, send that, and announce
 that the key is in the false message, so that we all get the
 wrong "valid" key.

 Still, it's an interesting idea.  Maybe it's already in place:
 Everything we read could be just a gloss covering the sub-rosa true
 message.  (That would explain the content of much of the news
 traffic, and virtually all of TV.)  Maybe everyone else already
 knows about this.  Weird.

 Can we make it work?

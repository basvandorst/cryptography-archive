Hello to all,

I'm new to cryptology.  I need to familiarize myself with this topic so I can
better understand how to use cryptography within my project.  Can anyone
suggest good texts about this?  Also, is there any organization (like the
IEEE) that has journals that deal with this?  I've looked at all the
organizations that the IEEE has and it doesn't seem to cover this topic.

Any helpful information would be greatly appreciated.

If you can, please email me.

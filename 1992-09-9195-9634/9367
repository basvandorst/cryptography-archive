I recently aquired a copy of PGP 2.0 for my personal use.  I have not been
following all the discussions on sci.crypt but I remember that the security
of PGP 2.0 was discussed.

If a summary of this discussion has been added to this group's FAQ could
someone e-mail me the address of the FAQ's location?  If this has not been
added to the FAQ would someone be willing to e-mail me a summary of this
group's opinion on the security provided by PGP 2.0?

Many Thanks!

NeXT ships its NeXTSTEP 3.0 software without the FEE software installed,
probably because of the US government forbidding it.

I have heard, however, that the hooks in NeXTmail are there (something I had
expected to be forbidden also). SO now the question is: can we make a joined
effort to create a package to install PGP in such a way on the NeXT that it is
automatically integrated with NeXTmail?

Or is somebody already working on this?

Btw. Using PGP in the US is illegal, because of the RSA patent. I don't see a
way yet to get around that one. But the rest of the world might force a
standard on this.

Sorry if I'm in the wrong group, asking a question that has been raised
recently, asking a FAQ (if so, pointers appreciated), or am committing a
breach of etiquette with my question.  It was suggested by a reader of
rec.broadcast.cable-tv that this is the group to ask:

Is the algorithm for VCR+ codes known?  Can someone point me to it if
it's available?

I will summarize if requested.

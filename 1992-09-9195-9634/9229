A new type of ATM fraud has just arrived in London.

An auction was advertised at which video cassette recorders and other
consumer electronic goods were for sale at very low prices. A lot of
people turned up and were asked to provide identification at the door -
this is normal enough at auctions in Britain - and the preferred means
of identification was a bank or credit card (you had to swipe it in a 
reader and enter your PIN at a nearby keypad).

This sort of `false terminal attack' was first reported in the USA in
about 1988. You'd think the banks would warn people about it, but
instead they seem determined to introduce PIN pads in retail outlets 
here. The idiots seem to believe that this will cut fraud from the 
current \pounds 200 million plus, but in practice it means that every 
bent merchant in the country will be able to collect card and PIN data.

What's the point of designing wonderful cryptographic systems when the
customer corporations think they know it all and build implementations 
that are trivial to break even without cryptanalysis? And what should
we taxpayers believe about the government's systems? Are civil servants
better at system design than bankers, despite earning half the salary?

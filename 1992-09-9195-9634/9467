I believe that this was mentioned in the movie.  If I recall properly,
Dan Aykroyd's character "Mother" gave some brief explanation like "It
won't be as accurate as a polygraph, but it will be enough for our
purpose."  I'm afraid I've only seen the movie once and I don't have a
photographic (DAT?) memory, so I can't provide a perfect quote.
Anyone?

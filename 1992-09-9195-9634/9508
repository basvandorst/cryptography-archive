Here's another report of the RSA FAQ printing fine. I sent it from my
Sun Unix account to my Mac via ZModem, sent it to my HP LJIIIP, and
it printed fine with no anomalies on the printed pages.

However, the printing ended with an error message. Perhaps the end
of the file had something in it that should have been removed.

I got 52 pages, including the bibliography and the RSA credit page.

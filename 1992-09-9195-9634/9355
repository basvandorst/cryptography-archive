You are introducing a rather nasty single-point failure.  One of the
reasons I have multiple credit cards and ATM cards is to guard against
the failure of either the card or the banking system.  I've had
ATM cards fail on their first use.  I've had problems with my banks
computers going down.  The LAST thing I want is a single card that
controls all my access.

I used to work for a company that audited travel agents.  They weren't
really interested in auditing.  They wanted to find out where people
were going.

Given this sort of thing, I don't think that you should actively
try to centralize things, especially in the government.

The real issue behind ATM security is that almost nobody has
the technical ability to defeat the security system.  It's more
effective to just mug people after they leave the machine.  Who
needs to decode the PIN off the back of the card?

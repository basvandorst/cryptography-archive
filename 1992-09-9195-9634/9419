That's why the ATMs manufactured by Citibank use a touchscreen with a 
directional privacy filter (two pieces of 3M "window shade").  Unless a 
tall person is standing over you, and quite close, it is very difficult to
see the contents of the screen.  Of course they could guess the key 
positions, not too hard.  An attempt to thward this was tried; they randomized
the key positions for each customer transaction.  This proved too difficult
in customer tests and was abandoned.

Terry, you keep talking about ``security'' and ``validation'' and
``trust'' without saying what these words _mean_.

A security violation is, by definition, a violation of the applicable
security policy. When there is no policy, there can be no violations. If
you're going to claim that a system is not ``secure,'' Terry, please
point out the security policy which has been violated. (Note that a
policy need not be a formal policy.)

Only the interpretation of a message can be valid or invalid. A message,
absent any interpretation, is neither valid nor invalid. If you're going
to claim that something has not been ``validated,'' Terry, please point
out what interpretation is in question.

``I trust T when he says X'' means that if T says X then I believe X.
Trust, absent any definition of T or X, is meaningless. If you're going
to claim that something is not ``trustworthy,'' Terry, please point out
who T is and what X is.

Now, Terry, why do you claim that MagNet is insecure? You say that its
keys are not ``validated'': what interpretation of the keys are you
talking about?

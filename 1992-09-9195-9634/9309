Would some kind soul please post a bibliography for an introduction to 
digital signatures?  I'd like to get a basic understanding of what constitures
a 'good' digital signature.  I've read Dorthy Denning's book, _Cryptography
and Data Security_ and tried some of the exercises in the end of each chapter,
but I got bogged down very quickly.  

I'm looking for books which are more narrative in form.  Something like Kahn's
book, _The Codebreakers_.  That was much more fun to read....

Anything anecdotal would be wonderful.

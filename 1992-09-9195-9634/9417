RSA holds the U.S. patent on using the difficulty of factoring large
numbers for crypto, just as Trimble Navigation now holds the U.S.
patent on using the Pythagorean Theorem for computing locations.
(Students are allowed to _experiment_ with the Pythagorean Theorem,
provided the theorem is neither used commercially nor exported.)

I have heard that a bootleg program, "Pretty Good Pythagoras" is
available from an anonymous ftp site in Greece (of all places!). No
word yet from Trimble on their lawsuit.

P.S. Seriously, I think the U.S. has set a bad precedent by allowing
mathematical discoveries to be patented. Diffie, Hellman, Merkle,
Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman deserve fame and riches, but not by having
the basic idea of trap door one-way functions patented! Ironically, I
bought a copy of RSA's "MailSafe." If RSA more aggressively marketed
it, and ported it other systems (like the Mac!), it might be more of a
market success. As it is, I expect to be using PGP 2.0 very soon now,
as all my friends are getting it (and only one has bought MailSafe,
besides me!).

most cheap "number wheel" bike locks *do* work that way. Put tension
on the lock, then spin the cylinders. One will bind as it hits the 
correct number. Then you spin the remaining ones. One of *them* will
bind. Etc. It takes about a minute to open. :-)

I know of no *decent* lock that behaves this way. But there are a lot
of junk locks out there!

        I'm getting knee-jerk reactions from people who think I'm
        suggesting an alternative to the "web of trust". Be assured
        that that is not the case. I am, however, distinguishing
        between trust and privacy, and thinking about the latter.


        I'm talking about using keys published in postings to
        newsgroups. A spoofer would have to create new keys for every
        contributor to every newsgroup I receive, otherwise he would
        not be able to read my outgoing mail, and would not know what
        responses I was requesting, or whether a message was a spoof
        check or just a note about a posting. The essential feature of
        spoofing is that it must be *preemptive*, and cover all
        communications which might contain a key. It must also start
        before my public key is widely distributed. This is a good
        reason *not* to change one's key very often, because each of
        these occasions will present an opportunity to a lurking
        spoofer. It is also a good reason to start publishing your key
        *now*, before the three-letter (four-letter in my country)
        agencies get a grip on it.

        Finally, the people I am using to check my key would
        specifically not be "my correspondent", who I must assume
        would also be spoofed. Since my reader automatically scans
        incoming news and mail for new keys to add to my public key
        ring, it will also detect a new public key for an old user;
        warning of a possible problem.

        This totally negates the advantages of public-key. If I've got
        to use a separate channel for validation, I may as well use
        private keys.

        OK - I send messages encrypted with sig keys to randomly
        selected people in Finland, New Zealand, France, VietNam and
        Austria. The only thing these folk have in common is that they
        include public keys in their news sig and are frequent posters
        to news groups or BBS conferences that have nothing to do with
        my work or hobbies. Some of them may be pulled from the README
        file in software I've bought, or files from any of a
        half-dozen BBS's in my local calling area. These messages
        include my public key *inside* the encrypted part. What was it
        you were saying?

        ,Marc

I have heard descriptions of small devices (eg., pocket calculator size)
which apply a secret DES key to a challenge (random) number to produce a
response for use in login (instead of a password).  Does anyone out there
know manufacturers for such devices so that I can get technical and
price information?

I'll post a summary of responses...

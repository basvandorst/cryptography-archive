 It seems to me that there are only two really different schemes
 on the list:  Telephone Verification, and all the rest.  What the
 rest have in common is the assumption that we will have at least
 one validated key.  With a validated key (and a helpful partner)
 we can leverage the world.  The problem is *getting that key*.

              ...             And if one agency is not secure enough,
 can multiple such agencies really provide additional security?
 (If the Opponent can penetrate one, we can't reasonably doubt that
 they can penetrate another.)


Banks use the post. International money transfers go through a system called
SWIFT (see Davies and Price for details): the key management consists of
senior officials sending each other letters at their home addresses. The key
structure is end-to-end (each bank might have 1000 correspondents and it will
have exchanged at least two key components with each of them). There are no
(admitted) losses due to external attack in almost 20 years.

An alternative is to use print media. Get your MP to utter his public key in
the house, and check it in Hansard. If the spooks can nobble that, we don't
need public key cryptography, we need a revolution ...

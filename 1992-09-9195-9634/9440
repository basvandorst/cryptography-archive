My previous bank had a good policy.  You could select your own PIN, anywere
between 5 and 15 digits, or they would issue you a 5 digit PIN.  This way,
people who don't care either way get a 5 digit PIN that they can commit to
memory and not write down, and people more concerned with security can have
one that's reasonably long.

I believe that most (all?) ATM and POS networks (at least in the US) are 
designed such as to support PINS up to 15 digits.  What the member banks
allow their customers to have is up to each bank.

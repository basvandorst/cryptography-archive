Maybe this would rather go into sci.electronics but what the heck, it's on
topic. I know the theory around frequency inversion, but I'm trying to build a
circuit that does it without succes. I've been thinking of something along the
lines of a 741 comparator to invert the audio with a reference frequency.

Is there any guru out there who can make me see the light?

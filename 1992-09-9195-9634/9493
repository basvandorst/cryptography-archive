I beg to disagree.  Since the Internet spans multiple continents and
cotains many sites, the amount of manpower needed to do that covertly
is very large.  Since you spoke of subverting the whole net or a large
part of it, that cannot be done just by monitoring the transatlantic
cables or satellites or a few key sites.  You must subvert the
Internet at every commercial place or University.  This manpower will
cost a lot of money.  How much?  I don't know.

Okay.  In your opinion, what constitutes a non-naive way of doing
public key cryptography?  Or indeed cryptography per se?  (I'm not
flaming you and I have missed the beginning of this thread, sorry.)

That is undoubtedly true.  But there is a difference between wanting
security and being paranoid.  I mean, I don't send snail mail letters
in safes just because some three-letter agency might steam them open
otherwise.

That's true.  You cannot validate keys over an insecure channel.

I disagree.  In fact, I seem to have missed your point. If I post my
public key and someone chooses to trust it, that's fine for me.  It's
his or her credibility that is at stake if he or she publishes a
signed copy of my public key.  Nobody has to trust a public key in
order to use it.  Of course, people have to understand that just
because the public key appeared on a BBS, it's not necessarily valid.

Oh, not to make you angry, but, see, I just don't agree with you:

If you reply, please send mail to neuhaus@informatik.uni-kl.de, not

and I'm not sure when we'll get it fixed.  Thank you.

Have fun.

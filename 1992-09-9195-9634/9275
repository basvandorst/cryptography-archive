I'm sorry to post this, but I can't think of any alternative.

I've been trying to reply to mail sent to me by Jim Reid on the
subject of DES, but there's an utterly broken mailer between here
(England) and there (Scotland).  Goodness knows, there's no problem
sending mail around the world, but Cambridge to Strathclyde?  No way!

So Jim, if you see this, I've tried to reply...

Cheers, Andrew.

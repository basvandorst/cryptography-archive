     You may finally have found the application for amorphous 
semiconductors.  They've been around for about 20 years, and other
than being used for flexible solar panels, nobody has found a good
reason to use the technology.  You might write to Stanley 
Ovishinsky of Energy Conversion Devices, Troy, Michigan, who invented
them.

     Another alternative is to package smart cards as things one puts
on keyrings, rather than in wallets.  Such devices have been
built, but don't sell well.

Note that this FTP server can't be used from systems behind many
packet-filtering gateways.  It tries to contact our authd, and fails
because we don't allow incoming connections, and the FTP connection hangs.

Note that it *does* allow connections from systems that don't run authd, so
it's not a security issue, it's just a poor implementation of the auth
client.

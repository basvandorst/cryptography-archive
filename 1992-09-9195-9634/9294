Yeah, I wondered about this, too.  The probable answer is that Phil does
not officially have anything to do with pgp2.0.  He could, of course,
give his secret key to the current developers, but I suspect his
attorneys probably advised him not to do anything such that this release
could be linked back to him.

It would be nice if the current folk would issue their own signature.

Another reason may be that they are using MD5 in 2.0.  Does anyone know
if pgp2.0 is compatible with pgp1.0?

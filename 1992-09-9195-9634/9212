This of course not an old idea. Look up any decent history book and read all
about the industrial revolution and English emigration law. :-)  If anyone
believe this worked they should also believe that the Merrimack Manufacturing
Company was an illusion.

On the other hand, the people who laugh at the export restrictions probably
haven't done any real integration testing of a really large software construct.
At least there's a fair chance that the foe fouls up...

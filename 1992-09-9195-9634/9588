Of course, I neglected the obvious spook stratagem of watching all
outwards traffic and faking the callbacks.  The bottom line is that
if you can't trust your own machine, you're screwed.  Unfortunately,
many (most?) people (e.g. me) pass all traffic through a single
upstream node, which results in the same problem w.r.t. that machine,
which you probably trust much less.  Still, I think it beats news.

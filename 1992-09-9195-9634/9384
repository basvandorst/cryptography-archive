Yes - I also feel a bit disappointment in the use of a relatively new
alogrithm.  Can DES be used as an alternatative algorithm in PGP?

Check nic.funet.fi and kampi.hut.fi, there are some DES implementations.

What does this mean - implementations or descriptions?  What countries
are COCOM countries?

Sounds like a good idea.

                   -- NEW CIPHERSYSTEM --

                  SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

     On  the  baisment  of  new ideas algoritm of enciphering
worked out and satisfactoried of all demands, that  makes  to
ciphers.
     Enciphering of open text is maked by the same key K1.
     When   the  enciphering  of  the  text  any  length  was
finished, binary code short length L is  forme,  to  wich  we
apply the key K2 such leugth as K1.
     quantity  Z1  of possible Keys K1 may'l be so much great
and qvantity of keys K2 amount to Z2=2**L. Rvalue Z1  and  Z2
depend  on two arguments. Change these arguments , we receive
different private cases of algoritms of enciphering . In time
of deciphering essentially condition is knowledge of two keys
K1  and  K2,  which may will be determine by outsider only by
seach of varios of encipering in quantity amount to Z=Z1*Z2.
     Author of this algoritm is  physic-theorist,  who  isn't
cryptography  expert.  In  present  time author have at one's
disposal only algoritm, which described above, but if  is  it
necessary, attraction program may be create.
     Author  propose  to  interesting firms conclude contract
with him, including next conditions:
     1.Legalize of patent on the name of author;
     2.All rights on patent posession will be belong to  this
company.
     For  conclude  this contract it is necessary preliminary
agreement about some conditions, when this work may be assume
and pay by firms. Minimum price  of  algoritm  makes  up  one
million dollars USA.
     This  supply  sended to 20 firms and companys, therefore
auction is possibele.
     Author will be answere on all questions, which intrested
firms.

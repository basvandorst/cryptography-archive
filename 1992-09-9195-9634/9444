Even the Citibank terminals, which use a CRT touch screen for all input,
have sprouted braille at the cardslot, deposit slot, cash dispenser and
under the CRT.  Each of these terminals also has a private line phone 
handset; does the blind user use the handset to accomplish the transaction
(opening another set of security considerations if the PIN must be spoken), 
or is there a CRT overlay that blind customers must bring with them?

It would be nice if the signatures for these were well known.
For example, each part of a distribution could have associated with it
a hunk of data consisting of signatures from the various checksumming
programs, say md4, md5, snefru, brik, etc.

This could also apply to the files contained within a distribution,
where a self-check could be administered at unpacking time.

Gene Kim and Gene Spafford at Purdue are currently betatesting a tool
called tripwire that accumulates
a database of signatures (including *all* the unix file system attributes).
This wouldn't be spoofproof, but when 2 parties disagree about the signature
of a file, or of a collection of files (which can be signatures or lists of
same), they can investigate further.  Publishing signatures of software
releases and distributions makes a lot of sense IMO!

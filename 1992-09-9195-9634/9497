 If there really were no way to assure that a powerful network
 middleman could not read our messages, then I think there would
 be little point in using cryptography at all.  In fact, I suggest
 that cryptography is actually *dangerous* *unless* we can meet
 such a goal.

 But two people *can* meet in person and exchange secret keys, and
 they *can* communicate securely *despite* any network middlemen.
 Personally, I do not need to know whether or not a middleman is
 present; all I need is secure communication.

 We are not discussing whether secure communication is *possible*;
 we are discussing *how* to obtain it, short of single key ciphers
 and personal meetings.  But if that's what it takes, then that's
 what it takes.  Any cipher system which is only secure until the
 Opponent decides to break it is not secure at all.

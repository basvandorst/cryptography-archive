Do you know this for sure? Since the contest claims to "prove" the
reliability of the PKZIP 1.10 encryption this seems very unlikely to
me. This would mean the file is not generatoed by PKZIP 1.10 and, even
worse, could not possible have been generated by it either. I
always figured the file was just filled with random crap (except maybe
for some message at the start of it).

Hi all,

  Given the all the reasonable hullabaloo about verifying keys, what do
people think about, in the interim, placing copies of our keys in our
.plan (on unix and vms) so when people finger you, they can see a copy
of it.  Obviously, two flaws with this method are:
a) someone could create a fake account...
b) someone could intercept the finger requests.

Still, it's an idea to play with (we could also combine it with other
checks..none of which are great alone, but together make it more
difficult to spoof something).  In the end, we can never be sure
(even a phone call could be spoofed), but we can develop a certain degree
of confidence.  Also, if this idea is totally stupid, please don't flame,
I'm new at cryptography, so be nice :).

finger my account to verify this public key!  (obviously this isn't a sure-
fire verification method, but it's better than nothing).

It's a kernel bug. It reportedly happens with Ultrix, HP-UX and others
(ghost.dsi.unimi.it runs HP-UX). When the authd connection fails with
ICMP not reachable, these kernels zap all existing connections to that
host. The bug is there for all to see in the 4.3BSD NET/1 code.

How to find out if you have the bug:

	% ftp    131.155.70.100
	(suspend ftp when connection has been established)
	% telnet 131.155.70.100 111

The telnet command should fail. If this messes up the ftp connection
your kernel has the bug.

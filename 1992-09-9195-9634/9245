It's not patents that holding up smart ATM cards, it's cost and benefits.
In order to find the *maximum* amount that any rational bank[1] would spend
on a smart ATM card, divide the amount of fraud that you expect that
technology to prevent by the number of cards outstanding.  The last I
heard, for the kinds of things that smart cards might possibly prevent,
this amounted to about $0.10 per card.

Of course they are, but if they don't loose anything (themselves) they cannot
secure that <nothing>, can they?  :-)   I guess what we need is some legal
case, some really bad publicity (on the behalf of banks) and maybe a law or
two to make this security "worth the cost" for banks. Who should pay the cost,
however, the customers or the owners, that's outside the charter of this group
to discuss.

Well, why don't CNN or any other tv station make some feature on the topic?
The naive Joe Public v. the "hear no evil, see no evil, say no evil" banks
should make an interesting show.

(For a good story about a related problem, read Forbes Magazine, Aug. 3, 1992.)

That's maybe a related problem to the above. John Doe doesn't understand
how "open" the system is today, and there's a limit to how advanced the
systems can be before he's unable to use them.


Btw., can anybody out there give one or two really good reasons for using
only 4 digit PINs? Why do all these cards have 4 digit PINs? Even my one
time password cards use a 4 digit PIN. (Ok, I wouldn't feel much safer
with a 6 digit PIN. Maybe there's some logic there after all - at least
the public isn't fooled into believing that a longer PIN would be safer.)

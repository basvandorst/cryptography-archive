Seems like a good idea to me. Maybe we should run such a contest
ourselves, but properly this time... If we can agree on the rules, I
could encrypt a few archives (using plain PKZIP 1.10) and make them
available. I am ready to do any kind of tests and supply any
information, except the password itself. This way anybody who wishes
could try any attack s/he knows about. Any takers?

We have yet to see -any- professional attacks on PKZIP. Currently I
have seen only brute force and in instance a dictionary attack. I
guess most of the people who have good knowledge in the filed (and do
not work for some spooky agency) are just not interested by the
problem. Maybe it is not challenging enough for them...

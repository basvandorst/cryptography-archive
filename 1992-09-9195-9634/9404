	A few weeks ago somebody asked if the ex-Soviets were likely
	to be forthcoming about their cryptographic research, this is
	a sort of follow-up.

	It seems that even the intelligence services are in need of ready
	cash and are looking to grant access to a lot of files from the
	First (Foreign Intelligence) and Second (Security) Directorates
	of the KGB predating the 1960s.  It is a little more complicated
	than this because of agreements signed with U.S. publishers (Crown)
	and a commission of enquiry in Russia.  In the meantime, from
	"Surveillant 2.5 (March/April 1992, yes, it's late again):

	"In the meantime, the Public Affairs and Press Bureau* says it will
	handle requests submitted in writing, by letter or fax, on an
	individual basis.  Those involving organizations besides the former
	KGB, in whole or in part, will be forwarded to the agency for action.
	No estimate of response time was given since there are too many
	variables which can't be foreseen accurately.  But those with
	experience of our own FOIA will realize that it is highly unlikely
	that the request satisfaction times will be shorter than those
	encountered here.  For further information contact the Chief of
	the Press Bureau,

		Yuri Kobaladze,
		Kolpachny Pereulok 11
		Moscow,
		Russia.

		Voice:  923-6213**
		Fax:    923-8191"  [Quoted without permission]

	Could make for an interesting seminar speaker.

	*       It's not clear if the organization is the KGB Foreign
		Intelligence Veterans Association or the Russian Foreign
		Intelligence Service, probably the former.

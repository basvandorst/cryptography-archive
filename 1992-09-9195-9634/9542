 Unless, of course, an intruder penetrates your physical security and
 gets all ten at once.  Multiples only count if they are independent.

 Since I know nothing about MagNet, I have no idea whether it really
 is secure or not.  But if operates generally in the way described
 here, I cannot see how it possibly could be called "secure."  Or,
 maybe "MagNet" is secure, while the information conveyed on it isn't.

 If you just get a public key from somewhere, you can assume that
 it was created, but not by whom.  If MagNet is penetrated, the
 key you see in any message may not be the one originally sent.
 If a spoofer replaced the original key with one of his (or her) own,
 the spoofer can read any mail you send under that key.  If you send
 your key back signed under that key, the spoofer can replace your
 key with a different key, re-sign and send it on.  Now the spoofer
 has access to both directions.

 In a sense, you have "secure communications."  Unfortunately, you
 are secure with a spoofer, who then decides to pass the information
 along.  When the recipient replies it appears that you are secure
 end-to-end, but you are not.  Normally, when we see that this sort
 of thing is possible, we call the system "broken" and "insecure."

   Supposing I have a complete description of DES in text form, and I split it
into 8 parts, with file N containing every 8th character modulo N.

   If 100 people each decide to post one of these files (they make a random
choice without knowing about the other 99 people even being there), and posts
it to a place that can be publically accessed outside the US, then have any
restrictions on DES been violated?  If so, who violated them?  How?

That is correct. One solution to this ``problem'' is to run around
screaming ``Public key cryptography is useless!'' Another solution is to
shrug your shoulders and say, ``I don't _need_ to know _who_ can read my
response. All I need to know is that it's the same person or group of
people as last time. What I need is continuity.''

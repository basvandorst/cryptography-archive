A reference for the type of test I think they use is in "The pseudoprimes
to 25*10^9, by Carl Pomerance, John Selfridge, and Sam Wagstaff, 
Mathematics of Computation volume 35, 1003-1026.

An interesting sidebar to this discussion is that early versions of
Mathematica (<1.2) had a bug in them that I discovered quite by
accident.  It seems that n=(2^56+1)/257 had the property that
PrimeQ[n] returned True, but FactorInteger[n] returned a
factorization.  This was a bug in the implementation, but it had me
excited for a few minutes when I thought I had found a number that the
authors of the above paper had offered money.  In fact it was just a
bug, which was later fixed.  To my knowledge, no number has been found
that is both a strong pseudoprime and a Lucas pseudoprime.

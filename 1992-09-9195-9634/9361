Has anybody tried the TeX version? I downloaded it, but when I tried
to print it, I received a lot of warnings about unknown citations...
It seems that the references are not present in the file... I have to
admit that I am not a TeX wizard, so the probability that I have
fooled something up is relatively high. Maybe there is a separate file
with the references? Help, anyone?

Regards,
Vesselin

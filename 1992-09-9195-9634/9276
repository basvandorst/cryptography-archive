However the patent owners, Ascom-Tech AG, are being very reasonable about
the patent (totally unlike PKP).  They let us use it in PGP without having
to pay any license fees since PGP is free, and are very approachable about
it's use in other programs.  Still, I ended up not using it in my PGP-compatible
archiver since I have a religious thing about patents - however, IDEA is a very
good cipher and the way the patent is being administered is one of the more
enlightened I've seen.

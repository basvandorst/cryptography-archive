 That's both encouraging and discouraging.  This is a "simple"
 mechanism:  If NSA can break it, we can at least hope to figure
 out how, and how much it would cost.  That would also tell us a
 little about the NSA definition of acceptable individual security.

 But ain't it sumthin?  We can't take "yes" for an answer!  We ask
 NSA for permission and if they don't give it we can't ship the code,
 and if they *do* give permission, that devalues the cipher in our
 eyes.  This logic is faulty, of course; there could be any number
 of reasons for making that decision.  Maybe NSA just realized that
 pkzip was already out of their control.  Or maybe NSA is just
 trying to get us to do some real cryptography.  Or maybe they
 straight-out broke pkzip.

Ummm...  that sounds like a scam to me.

The exact proceedure through which this magic occurs is not clear from the
posting.  I can interperet the above description in two ways:

(1) the box is able to port any program from an apple II over to a
macintosh simply by monitoring the apple II while it runs the program
to be ported.  That's clearly nonsense.  There is no way that I can be
sure I have caused the apple II to execute every line of code in a
given program, but if the code isn't executed, then your box won't see
it, and hence the macintosh version can't know about it, unless the
demo was a sham and the macintosh version was already stored on the 
mac's floppy disk.   I certainly would not put any money into the hands
of anyone looking for venture capital to "take this box to market".

(2) the box is able to port any program from an apple II over to a
macintosh by running converter software on both the apple II and
macintosh, with the apple II disk drive used to read in the program to
be ported.  In this case, the macintosh-resident code is an apple II
emulator, the apple II-resident code is kermit, and the pink box is a
null modem for a serial cable.  By my recollection, apple II emulators
for the mac were available commercially fairly soon after the mac
appeared, so the whole magic package could probably have been put
together for about $100 from off-the-shelf stuff at Computerland.
Again, an attempt to raise venture capital for such a pink box sounds
like a scam to me.

The cynic in me says that the primary "applications in cryptography" would
be as a reminder that the propagation of trust is a rather complex problem,
particularly where financial matters are involved.  *That* is certainly
a subject which has been discussed here in sci.crypt often enough.

So what you are saying is any public key encryption is useless to me
because the odds of me being able to get in direct touch with people to
verify keys (especially if they change them often) is next to nill.  As
I am connected more than Joe Public this implies encryption is useless to
them.  Get a grip, I find it hard to believe that there is someone between
me and the machine that carries news to the world.  (Unless they get at some
of MY hardware I don't think it's economically feasable.)  Here's my public
key.  My USENET access is screwey, I get everything at least twice.  This
includes my own posts.  If you don't here me screaming soon you'll know this
is my public key.

PS. Sorry I don't know to spell feasable.

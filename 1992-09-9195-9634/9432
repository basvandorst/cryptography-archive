   I'm familiar with the appearance of all the (relatively) new 900MHz
cordless phones, as I played with them at the Summer CES.  The one used in
the movie was the standard 46/49 (or 46/1.6MHz) variety, as indicated by the
extendable whip antenna.
 
  The Panasonic model uses 900MHz, but is analog voice, by the way...
 
   The other models are digitized voice & some use spread spectrum, which
means that 'codes' are in use, but they are not encrypted (aka 'scrambled,')
despite what their literature might say.

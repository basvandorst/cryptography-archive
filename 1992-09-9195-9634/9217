Probably the same reason that anybody publishes estimates of the other side's
resources, so they can justify their own position or expenditure. Story goes 
of a Russian general asking his opposite number not to do this because
"We don't want our politicians to know we spend that much".

GCHQ can be located by observing the unexplained deviation in the 
microwave trunk route...

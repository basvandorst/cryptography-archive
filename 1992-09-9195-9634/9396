Well, at least *some* of the dialog had to have come straight from Adelman.
Did anyone listen closely to the seminar chalktalk Herr Professor was giving?
[It sort of faded in & out of the background as Redford & what's-'er-name
were talking.] There were lots of "real" buzzwords floating around, like
"cyclotomic polynomial", etc., that the script writers *must* have had

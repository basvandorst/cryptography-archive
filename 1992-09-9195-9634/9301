A technique I used to publish my RSA public key
was to embed the modulus (legibly) into a logo
that was then submitted as a United States Trademark.

The application and Trademark are then published
throughout the world, in most libraries in the US,
and even kept on microfiche.

For $175, this is much cheaper than, say, taking out
an ad in the New York Times.


All I have to do is point to a particular date of
publication and the person who wants to check my
PK can look it up in his or her own local library,
which is unlikely to have been spooked!

Hmmmmm.  Guys?  I've never messed with this contest, but with ordinary
vanilla PKZip 1.10, two things are true:
1.  The password can be verra long.  
2.  It's a little tough to check brute force for the password when you're
    checking a 32 * 3 bit encryption header against a 16 bit CRC.
    Just because your password decrypts the header to a valid CRC, that
    doesn't mean you've generated a password that regenerates the encryption
    header, and hence, you can't necessarily decrypt the file . . . of course
    I get the impression that for this contest, we're talking about the 
    password, not the encryption header.  More's the shame.

    I actually FAXed Phil Katz about this, but nobody ever came across
    with any examples.  I did get a call back, though, so that's not 
    all bad.

I'm not saying you can't check the English dictionary and crack 90% of all
encryptions, I'm just saying that if you're going up against God, and if
God is using PKZip, and if you plan to brute-force the problem, then as
far as I know, you're deep in the hole.

Regards,
Mike

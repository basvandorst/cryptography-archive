A couple of years ago I read of an ATM  fraud which didn't involve
stealing of pins etc. Two banks here in england where amoungst the first
to cooperate in allowing their customers to use each others ATM's.

In order to provide a system which didn't require the two banks computers
to get too intimate (for security), they hit on the idea of writing the
cash limit of the individual on their card together with a check number.

When the customer placed his card in an ATM and withdrew money his
weekly cash limit would be decremented by the amount withdrawn. At
midnight on Sunday the check number would be changed and the next time the 
card was used the machine would restore the weekly cash limit.

The fraudsters openned a number of accounts with the two banks        
depositing large amounts and demanding for various reasons, a large cash limit
on their cards. Then using a magnetic card copier and some blank plastic cards
(on which strips of video tape had been glued) they duplicated the cards
and in one day withdrew huge amounts from various ATM's.

This worked because the ATM's only send transactions in in batches
and the banks only exchanged information at midnight. As the original
card was "Legit" access to the PIN was no problem and of course
the copy cards where each "fully charged".

In my own efforts to obtain PGP 2.0, I've found it and learned how to get it
without FTP access. You can get it too. (Thanks to all the email offers of
help!)

If you are reading this you can simply send email to a mail server. Simply
compose a message body of:

ENCODER uuencode
SEND pub/unix/security/crypt/pgp20src.zip      [C source code] (and/or)
SEND pub/unix/security/crypt/pgp20.zip         [MS-DOS executable]

Send this to the address ->  mailserv@nic.funet.fi

Both packages have full documentation, but only the MS-DOS package has the
public key of the author together with sample key rings. You can use both
SENDs to obtain both packages, which will result in 15 batched messages
delivered within 24 hours most likely.

The Northern Lights also offers dialup access to these files using XMODEM
and KERMIT protocols via a captive account menu.

Dial:  1 518 237-2163  at 300-2400 bps 8N1 24 hours a day.

Then login directly to the pgp account as follows:

	tnllogin: pgp
	Password: key

and help yourselves. TNL's source package is changed to pgp20src.tar.Z to
be more easily compatible with UNIX.

I recommend that everyone without FTP access gets going quickly. Ya never
know how long this will be around.

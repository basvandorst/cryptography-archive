   I am reading "The Code Breakers". Many people talk about cyphers in a
   theoretical sense, but the test is in the cryptanalysis. So here is the
   cyphertext:

   And my question is this: Apart from talking theory here. Are there people who
   can solve this very simple system?

   I you can solve this you will know, why it cannot be used (hint, hint)

I think I have solved this one.  There are serious flaws, not the
least being that I solved it using only some character-counting code
and by munging the ciphertext in an emacs buffer.  Disregarding that,
it would appear that the method is not invertible in general, though
in practice it is possible to work out the meaning of the plaintext.

That's enough hints -- I don't want to spoil it for anyone else.  The
author will presumably tell me whether I've cracked it, or whether I'm
just makng a fool of myself in public again 8-)

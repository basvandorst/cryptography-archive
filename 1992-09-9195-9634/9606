Yes.

You have two large primes, P and Q.
Let N = P * Q.  That's your "really big number".
Find a pair of numbers, E and D, such that mod(E * D, (P-1)*(Q-1)) = 1
You publish N and E as your public key.  To encrypt messages, calculate
    Y = mod(X ** E, N), where X is the input data

You keep N and D as your private key.  To decrypt messages, calculate
    X = mod(Y ** D, N), where Y is the encrypted data

If you have somebody's N and E, and you somehow factor N into P and Q, you
must then find a D that works in the above equality (a non-trivial task, I
think).  Then you can decrypt his/her messages.

PGP is essentially RSA performed on a bitmask which is used repeatedly on
a single message.  I don't know about the others.

Check out the "Mathematical Games" column of _Scientific American_, August
1977, for a cursory examination of RSA.  Then August 1978 for a full-blown
article.

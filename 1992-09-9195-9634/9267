Amen.

My normal ATM card developes a split after a month or two which just
keeps growing.

As far as I can tell, this comes from my sitting on it in my wallet.

Since we can make truly flexible magnets, I would assume we could make
truly flexible ATM cards -- so that they wouldn't split.


The real question:  can we plate chip logic onto a flexible substrate
and have the layers just as flexible?

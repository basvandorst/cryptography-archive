Hi.

Yesterday, I announced that PGP 2.0 was available for anonymous ftp
from ftp.uni-kl.de.  I had downloaded the UNIX files from
ghost.dsi.unimi.it, but there were apparently some problems during the
carriage return elimination.  I have deleted the files from
ftp.uni-kl.de and will upload them again when I get a clean version.

In the words of Douglas Adams: We apologize for the inconvenience.

Have fun.

Hmm.  So when a law enforcement agent comes and tries to rob your cash
with civil forfeiture, it is a good defense to carry "Computer
Networks" with you all the time so you can shoot the robber with it,
and since the government has decided that the book indeed is munition
the robber who is working for the government must abide by the
government's decision and die?

Does this also mean that there are minimum waiting periods and
background checks required before you are allowed to buy "Computer
Networks?"

Inquiring minds want to know.

No, I don't know it for sure. In fact, as somebody pointed to me by
e-mail, I am wrong. The contest archive has been produced with the -es
option of PKZIP and Phil Katz has just selected a file that does not
shrink well.

I still doubt that the "normal" PKZIP is able to handle passwords from
the full 8-bit ASCII alphabet... In fact, I have noticed recently that
it does not handle well even passwords with characters that are
forbidden in the DOS file names (+$, etc.). The problems seems to be
in how COMMAND.COM interprets the delimiters and in the fact that
PKZIP does not ask you about the password interactively, but expects
it as a command-line argument.

No, Phil Katz has stated that the file -does- have a meaningful
contents and is not just crap.

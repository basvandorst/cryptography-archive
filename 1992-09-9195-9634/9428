        Agreed. But a great bunch of FTP sites aren't a centralised
        place, and the idea is to have a reliable directory, not a
        trusted source. Trust still requires the equivalent of a
        face-to-face introduction. A name on the Internet, like a name
        in the phone book, relates only to a "persona" until someone
        you trust provides a "true identity". The main objective at
        this point is not trust but privacy.

        On this point I firmly agree with PRZ and intend to encrypt as
        much mail as possible. In this case, my signature and public
        key are inside the encrypted part. This will make it
        effectively impossible to later spoof communications with
        current correspondents. I wonder, if I normally encrypt all my
        mail, what *they* will think if I send one message in clear?

        The reason for sending it under cover of someone else's key is
        to get it past the spoofer unmodified, keeping in mind that,
        at this stage, we know we are being spoofed. When your friends
        start broadcasting your correct key, the spoofer will know
        that the fat lady has sung and there's not thing one he can do
        about it (except maybe show up with a warrant).

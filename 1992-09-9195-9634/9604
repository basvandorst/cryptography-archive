   Check out "Decoding a VCR Controller Code" by Ken Shirriff, Curt Welch,
   and Andrew Kinsman. Pg 227. CRYPTOLOGIA, Volume XVI Number 3, July 1992.

   Published by Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, Terre Haute IN 47803

   The article describes an algorithm that seems to correctly decode VCR Plus+
   codes that are 1 to 6 digits in length.

Thank you for the reference.  The obvious next question is has anyone
implemented it and made the source available for anon-ftp or the like?

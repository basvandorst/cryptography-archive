   Ummm... their technical advisor was the A in RSA.  I think most people
   would regard him as fairly compentent.  

   What matters is not just who the advisor was but how much they
   listened to him or her.
Or what the scope of the advice requested was in the first place. I'm
sorry I phrased it that way, I am of course aware that they don't give
technical advisors veto power, so I should have at least said "gotten
AND TAKEN" some competent ... advice." There's a lot that could be
said about the difficulties of doing good fiction/films on technical
subjects for mixed audiences, but it's off-topic here unless I encrypt
it (That's a lead-in for Dave Krieger if he's listening :-). Anyway,
I'm holding out for "Snow Crash -- the Movie".

   Agreed.  Instead, why not sit down with a copy of _The_Cuckoo's_Egg_,
   by Cliff Stoll.  It's a much better story, and everything in the book
   actually happened.
Yep! I advance-ordered it and had my copy in hand before it was
shelved. In fact I just loaned out my office copy this morning, with a
few glowing words.

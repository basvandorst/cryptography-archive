So looking through PKP's FAQ I find (direct quote):
"In North America, a license is needed to ``make, use or sell'' RSA. However,
PKP has a policy that anyone may use RSA non-commercially for a 
personal, academic or intellectual reason without a license; an example 
of such use would be the implementation of RSA as a programming project 
for a computer class. RSA Laboratories has made available (in the U.S. and
Canada) at no charge a collection of cryptographic routines in 
source code, including the RSA algorithm; it can be used for non-commercial
purposes."

Can I take this to mean that as long as I don't try to sell RSA based
software or use it in my work, that PKP is content to let me use RSA
without a licence? 

Say, for example, that I want to communicate in a secure manner with 
my buddy Joe who lives on the east coast, with no commercial intent;
but I want encryption because I believe my sysadmin or his is reading 
our mail and I value my privacy. Is this OK? Could we use PGP if 
we wanted to?

Does this represent a change of policy?

What about other public key systems that PKP's patents cover? (e.g. Rabin)

What this comes down to is
'What constitutes a "personal" reason for the use of RSA?'

Would someone from PKP care to comment? It would be nice to know
exactly what the paragraph from the FAQ means.

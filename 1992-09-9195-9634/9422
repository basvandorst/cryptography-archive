They are more than just generous with how they let you use MD5:

]RSA Data Security is announcing MD5, a new message-digest algorithm.
]Like MD4, this algorithm is being placed in the public domain for free
]general use.                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It don't get much freer than that.  There seems no reason to worry about
such recourse.  The only reasons I can think of to hesitate using MD5
are that it might have a hidden hole which allows RSADSI (or the NSA or
someone) to break it, or that you believe using MD5 widely enhances the
stature of RSADSI and you consider them evil and don't want to do so.

Oh, so UNIX uses slashes for directory stuff!  Did they get that idea
from MS-DOS?

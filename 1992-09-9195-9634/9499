 There *can be* no good reason to not change one's key.  If a key
 is compromised it must be changed, no matter when it happens
 nor how often it happens.  If we must depend upon beating the
 Opponent to the punch, all they have to do is compromise the
 current key (Fire! Fire!), making us publish a new one, and then
 they are first and they win.

 All this is completely beside the point that old information may
 yet be valuable and important, and it is in our interest to know
 what the loss of a single key may cost.  When the benefit from
 penetration exceeds our ability to protect, we *must* change keys.

 I doubt that the situation is that serious, but if it is, it is.
 I do not make the rules.  Nor is it necessary to *believe* me.
 The attacks I describe are effective, viable, and well within the
 capabilities of a government agency.  The only way to assure that
 these attacks will not be fielded is to use systems which do not
 fall to such attacks.

 But separate-channel validation does not "totally negate" the
 advantages of public-key.  We still have the advantage that the
 public portion of a public key may be monitored or copied with no
 effect on our security.  This supports secure key distribution by
 radio or in the presence of wiretaps.  Less than you would like,
 perhaps, but it's what we've got.

 I was saying that you had to get the sig keys first, and when
 you use an unvalidated key you have no security at all on that
 channel.  I was saying that if you use an old compromised key
 you have no security on *that* channel either, *regardless* of
 whether the owner knows the key is compromised or not.

 Welcome to the real world.

Please pardon my ignorance.

I keep hearing that RSA uses the product of two big primes to produce a really
big number that is hard to factor.  Appearently the diffuculty in factoring
the product of two primes is what makes RSA so hard to crack.

Now, assume that the actual factoring is trivial by use of some mathematical
method.  What good does it do you?  Exactly how does having the two prime 
factors of some really big number do to help you crack RSA?

In other words, if see someones public key, how can I find what really
big number they used? And then after I factor it, what whould I do to the
encrypted communications to return it to plain text?

Finally, is the product of two primes method used in all public keys, or
just in RSA? what about PGP?  What about the one the NSA and NIST produced.?

If anyone has any books or other materials that they would reccommend for
reading on the security of this type, I would appreciate it.

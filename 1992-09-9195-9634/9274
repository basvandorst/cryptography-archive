HELP!!!

One of my co-workers approached me today needing a decryptor that will break
the encryption option of PKZIP.  Evidently he has encrypted some vital files
and now cannot recall the password (I have already called him an idiot, so
no flames are necessary, thank you).

I seem to recall that this subject has been discussed in the past in this
newsgroup, and that someone had discovered a method for breaking it.

Would some kind soul please email me either source or binaries (sun4 or pc)
for this program.

Thanks in advance for any help,
marauder

There is an exactly analogous method to the bike lock cracking method
that can be used to crack byte at a time encrypted passwords using a memory
page boundry.  Start with a pointer 1 byte from the end of the memory page
load succesive trial first bytes for your guessed password into the last
byte of the page, then call the password checker using the pointer.  If
the checker rejected the trail the first byte is wrong, increment the
byte and try again. If you get a page fault the first byte is right, then
back up the pointer one byte and try two byte guesses using the known first
byte and successive second bytes.  repeat until you have all the bytes of the
password.  Asuming 10 byte passwords 256 values per byte this takes on average
10*256/2 = 1280 trys compared to O(256**10) trys.  If I remember right a early
version of the passwords on OS/360 were crackable this way.

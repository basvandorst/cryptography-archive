   A much better job was done on the standard spy stuff....

Well... Does it bother anyone else while looking at movies or reading
a newspaper that the writers are uniformly misinformed about subjects
you know something about?  Extra credit: extrapolate to subjects that
you don't know about, but which (presumably) someone else is
proficient at.  Frightening, isn't it.

Any real spy want to comment on Sneakers?

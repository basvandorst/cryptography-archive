Well, this would be pretty easy to do in a sh/awk/perl script, but be
aware that many mail transport agents may subtly change your mail so
that the signature will not be valid (for instance they might do
interesting things with tabs/trailing spaces/blank lines...). A
reasonable alternative might be to include both signed and unsigned
versions of the message (signed version using -a option). While this
would double the length of the messages in question, at least everyone
could read them and the signatures would be reasonably reliable.

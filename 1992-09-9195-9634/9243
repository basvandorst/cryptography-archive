Having examined it, PGP has addressed this question by providing for
keys to be certified by "authorities", those being people that you
designate. This allows you to have your friends, with whom you have
securely exchanged keys (presumably in person) to in turn certify new
keys. There are also key compromise certificates. There is also neat
built in radix-64 handling, a good unix port, apparent ports for VMS,
amigas and ataris, and all sorts of other goodies, and now it uses
IDEA as its base conventional cypher instead of Bass-O-Matic. Its all
quite winningly slick. I'd look at the docs before saying "yes, but
does it do X".

Summary: PGP is available on ghost.dsi.unimi.it
Lines: 91

The program Pretty Good Privacy program, version 2.0, is available
in the ~ftp/pub/crypt directory on site ghost.dsi.unimi.it.

I bet most of you already know what PGP is, anway here are two extracts
from the documentation included in the archive:

[from: readme.doc]

>          Pretty Good Privacy version 2.0 - READ ME FIRST
>
>
>    You are looking at the README file for PGP release 2.0.  PGP, short for
>    Pretty Good Privacy, is a public key encryption package; with it, you
>    can secure messages you transmit against unauthorized reading and
>    digitally sign them so that people receiving them can be sure they
>    come from you.

> Synopsis:  PGP uses public-key encryption to protect E-mail and data
> files.  Communicate securely with people you've never met, with no
> secure channels needed for prior exchange of keys.  PGP is well
> featured and fast, with sophisticated key management, digital
> signatures, data compression, and good ergonomic design.

> Pretty Good(tm) Privacy (PGP), from Phil's Pretty Good Software, is a
> high security cryptographic software application for MSDOS, Unix,
> VAX/VMS, and other computers.  PGP allows people to exchange files or
> messages with privacy, authentication, and convenience.  Privacy
> means that only those intended to receive a message can read it.
> Authentication means that messages that appear to be from a
> particular person can only have originated from that person.
> Convenience means that privacy and authentication are provided
> without the hassles of managing keys associated with conventional
> cryptographic software.  No secure channels are needed to exchange
> keys between users, which makes PGP much easier to use.  This is
> because PGP is based on a powerful new technology called "public key"
> cryptography.
> 
> PGP combines the convenience of the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA)
> public key cryptosystem with the speed of conventional cryptography,
> message digests for digital signatures, data compression before
> encryption, good ergonomic design, and sophisticated key management.
> And PGP performs the public-key functions faster than most other
> software implementations.  PGP is public key cryptography for the
> masses.

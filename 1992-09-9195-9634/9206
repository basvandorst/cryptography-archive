>   Supposing I have a complete description of DES in text form, and I split it

It is my understanding that a description of DES in text form is not
restricted, as long as it is not a software implementation of DES.  Byte 
Magazine already published one quite a few years back.  (I forget whether 
there was a full software implementation included or not.  There probably 
was, in something like 6800 assembly language.)  And it's my understanding 
that the Feds would think nothing of responding to a request for the 
appropriate FIPS or whatever standard, with the return address of KGB 
headquarters in Moscow, by sending the document.  This was back when
the Soviet Union existed and was considered an "Evil Empire".

I believe this is called a conspiracy.  It's probably illegal REGARDLESS OF
WHAT THE TEXT CONTAINED, even if it's a complete but PG-rated description 
of Clinton's first post-marital sex, the Constitution of the United States, 
or the text of one of Bush's speeches.  I think you're legally much safer
posting the plaintext.

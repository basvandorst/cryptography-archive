   True for DES (and indeed most ciphers), but what about intrinsically much
   simpler systems like RSA?  With suitable maths software, the distinction
   between a 'human-orientated description' and a 'computer program' becomes
   a very fine one.

Indeed. I suppose that Tanenbaum's book "Computer Networks" must now
also be classed as munitions since the first edition included Pascal
source code for a DES implementation.

Folks,

  If I have a number 9104 and I encrypt it using DES CBC and secret
key Y, is it possible to have a key X that causes a different number
like 12018 to generate the same cypher-text?  And if the cyphertext is
affiliated with some un-encrypted text (thus identifying the
originator of the plaintext), I must know both the secret key Y and
the fact that 9104 really did generate the plaintext before I can rule
out the possibility that 12018 generated it.  Correct?

 I have seen you make this point several times, and can honestly
 say that I have never understood it.

 As far as I can tell, the whole point of cryptography is to be
 able to restrict information to only those who are intended to
 have it.  When a public key "appears," it may really be a key
 which was generated inside a spoofing node.  When one responds
 to that key, one's response may be deciphered in the spoofing
 node, then re-enciphered to the ultimate recipient.

 Note that the recipient does, in fact, get the message.  One
 can communicate in cipher.  The problem is that the spoofing
 node gets to read all the communications.  So unless we actually
 *intended* that there be a spoofing node, and that they should
 read our messages, I think the cryptography has failed.

 As to public key being "useless," one should remember that,
 in the classical model of cryptography (point-to-point direct
 communication: the army camp radio communication model),
 public key does indeed solve the problem.  But direct radio
 communications normally admit no possibility of a "spoofer"
 who can intercept *and re-encipher* messages in transit.

 The problem is that the old model does not apply to store-and-
 forward computer networks, where it *is* possible for messages
 to be changed in transit.  So it should be no real surprise
 that there are problems beyond those predicted in the old model.
 This does not mean that public key is worthless.  However, as
 far as I can tell, the simple naive use of public key--the way
 it is described in most texts--cannot achieve the usual expected
 goals of cryptography in a network environment.

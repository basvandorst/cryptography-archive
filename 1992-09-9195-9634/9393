Ahem...
Remember RPEM? PGP wasn't the first system around to provide a nice 
interface to a public key system for Unix and code to implement it. 

What stopped most of us in North America from using RPEM was the fact 
that PKP threatened legal action. 

Use by clients/organisations certainly sounds like commercial use to 
me. I certainly don't like the current state of affairs, but the fact 
is that unlicenced commercial use of PGP in the U.S. and Canada would 
put one in a precarious legal position.

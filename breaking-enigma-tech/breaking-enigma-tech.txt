    No, it is not accurate.  There were several features of the Enigma
which had to be sorted out to decrypt a message.  The first was the
key mapping, if the rotors and plugboard were all pass through.  (The
Poles figured out that this was A is A, etc.)  Second, you needed the
transformations associated with each rotor.  There are 26!
possibilities for the ordinary rotors, and 26!/13! for the reflectors.
The British got most of these by capturing machines and rotors.  They
did attack rotors, but I can't remember any case where they did
completely figure out a rotor just from intercepts.  (The initial
rotor wirings came to the French through a spy.)

    Now that we have disposed of those problems, which were solved in
time frames of months and years, there were three problems to solve to
get the daily traffic on a particular net.  They needed the set of
rotors used and the order.  (I think some nets used three of four, and
that the naval traffic used four of seven of which two were
reflectors.  In any case these were changed infrequently.)  Then you
needed the initial rotor positions.  This is where the cribs and the
Bombes came in.  Finally you needed the plugboard wiring, but that was
a simple substitution on the final result.  (How do you recover the
rotor positions if you don't have the plugboard wiring?  Look for
cribs with unique letter patterns, and test any match that matches the
pattern by hand.  This is what the Bletchly Park operations people
spent lots of time doing.  Once you had the first "crack of the day"
for a given net, the rest was easy, since any crib, not just a nice
pattern, would do.)

   The bombes tested all possible rotor starting positions against a
crib.  Depending on the machine, this was either 26 cubed (17,576)
possibilities or 26 to the fourth power (456,976).  Taxing for a
mechanical system, but possible.  The BOE numbers I have say that it
took 6 hours to match a naval (4 rotor) key, which implies about 10 to
20 tests a second.  Of course the bombes were designed so that they
coud be started anywhere, which allowed several bombes to be devoted
to a single attempt at a crack.

  See above.  The problem with Enigma security was that the difficult
part of the problem was embedded in the hardware (the rotors) and the
Germans never used enough rotors.  Capture one army HQ, or ship, or
submarine, and you had the hard part of the job done.  But one
submarine, or even one weather ship, captured gave a window into all
submarine communications, etc.

   Simple substitutions are a group.  Since the Enigma (for any
particular rotor settings) is a sequence of simple substitutions, you
can solve for a single "key" that never existed.

   Having said that, if you know the plug board wiring and the first
rotor, the message can be broken up in to 26 character groups and
solved to get the identity and position of the second rotor, then you
can solve 676 character groups for the third rotor, usw.

   Now assume i have a crib with an "interesting" letter pattern like
abcabcdbc or some such.  I can ignore the actual letters and use the
bombe to get any match with the pattern in the encrypted message,
using also the fact that the wiring is reversable, and no letter
translates to itself.

   So, as I said, you need cribs with "interesting" patterns to get
the initial crack.  When you are finished, it is a simple substitution
crack to get the plugboard wiring.  That gives you all the traffic on
that net for the day, even though each message is encrypted with a
different key.  (You can now solve for rotor positions sequentially,
which will take an average of 52 tries by brute force for a four rotor
net.  Oops!)

    Not the only way to strengthen Enigma by making it simpler.
Advancing each rotor by a fixed delta after each letter also helps a
lot.  (You want to use deltas relatively prime to 26 and to each
other: 1,3,5,7 works nicely.)

But it isn't a simple substitution. Any particular rotor position is a
simple substitution, whether or not you have a plugboard, but that only
applies to one letter. The steckering on the input side of the Enigma
has a complex effect on the rotors, so you can't just ignore it.

Right, but as I understand it finding the plugboard wiring was the hard
part of breaking the daily key.

I don't understand this at all, I'm afraid. My memory of this is hazy
(it's a while since I read the Welchmann book), but as I understood it,
the bombes didn't work like that.

As I recall, each bombe was essentially three rows of 60 Enigma rotor
sets. The 60 columns held the 60 combinations of rotors (3 from 5); the
three rotor sets in each column were the same. You now guess (or know)
some plaintext for some ciphertext. Suppose they are:

     ADOLFHITLER
     FQPVTTDAWVB
     ^   ^  ^

The three marked columns are chosen. The middle row of rotors is set 4
positions ahead of the top row, and the bottom row 3 positions ahead of
that. The rotors and some other parts, including a 26 lamp indicator on
each column, are wired up to represent the three letter pairs. Current
is injected at a point representing "A" (in this case), and all 60x25
non-"A" lamps are inspected. Any unlit lamps represent a possible
steckering for "A" for that rotor set and position. Note this down, and
rotate all the rotors one step. Repeat until all 26^3 rotor positions
have been checked, then try out the results.

I don't see how to get from this to your "pattern" cracking. Have I
hopelessly misremembered, or is there some better description (perhaps
in the Kahn book, which I am having trouble tracking down) ?

  No, once you have the right rotor selections and settings, all that
remains is to solve a simple substitution cipher.  The trick is to
find the rotor positions without knowing the plugboard wiring.  There
were AFIAK two methods used to do this.  If there were several
messages with the same plugboard wiring and rotor positions (or
messages with portions for which the rotor positions overlapped) it
was possible to directly recover the rotor positions without the
bombes.  (I think this only worked on early Luftwaffe nets, but it was
basically abandoned once the bombes were working.  In any case it
involved stacking messages on plastic sheets and sliding them back and
forth to get matches, so it was known as "stacking.")

  The other approach as I said used "cribs" with repeated letters.
Basically, put one of these message fragments and the expected
plaintext in the bombe, and it will ring a bell and halt every time
you get a potential match.  The favored cribs were such that the
likelihood of a match other than the right one was very low.  (Most of
these were standard format message headers with Roman Numerals.  But
one case was an observer in the Sahara, who sent, "Weather clear,
nothing to report." every day for years.  British troops were
instructed to avoid his position, since if he HAD something to report,
they might not get that day's keys!)

  Violent agreement.  Once you have the wiring, the rest of the day's
traffic on that net is a snap.

  Once you have the rotor settings, decrypt the message with the
partial wiring you have from the crib.  Now it is possible to guess
some other wires.  Repeat as needed.  It is a little more complex than
a simple substitution, but only a few minutes worth.

  Wow!  I can't imagine doing anything so labor intensive.  It is
certainly well documented that the bombes halted and rang a bell on a
possible match.

  Which one?  "Cracking the Enigma", is good, but I don't remember it
as focusing on the decryption details.  There are two pictures of bombes
at the Nebraska Avenue naval station in Washington, DC that don't seem
to match your recollections at all.  I believe it shows dials at the
top for entering 16 characters each of plain and cipher text, and
eight sets of four "rotors" below that.  (These were presumably for
four-rotor naval machines.)

It is the other way around. The plugboard settings were pretty much known.
The Germans didn't change them as frequently as they did the rotor
settings. The *trick* part was the Germans only used a handful of possible
rotor wirings, so it was possible to exhaustively test them all.

I have a bunch of decrypted messages, and there are certain words that
appear in almost every message, some in the exact same place. This made
cribbing for text much easier than it should have been.

Plugboard wiring did not change on a daily basis. The hard part was
determining which rotors were used, and what the rotor settings were. In
some cases, the rotor settings changed more than once a day. Multiply this
by the number of different nets, and the fact that the message had limited
lifetime of usefulness, and that was where the problem was.

No. See above.

I think you are trivializing the quantity of work involved. It was not
simple, nor was it a snap to solve the Enigma. For example, The plugboard
wiring alone was capable of producing 532985208200576 possible
combinations. This is not simple substitution. To trivialize this process,
does a disservice to the people that labored long hours trying to solve
these problems. It was and still is, quite difficult.

The Enigma was a reasonably sound machine for its time. It is hard to
solve, and even today there are probably only a handful of organizations
that could crack messages properly encrypted with it on a regular (useful)
basis. The problem was how the Germans used it, which led to its being
defeated.

This is not correct. The Germans changed the plugboard settings when
they changed the rotor settings. The German army had one key
setting procedure that was introduced towards the end of the war (1944?)
which would change the rotor order twice during the day. If I remember
right that rotor order change took place at 9:00 and 16:00 German
local time. When these changes happened the plugboard settings were not
changed, but this is the only case I know about. All the other key
setting sheets I have found always gave a new plugboard setting.

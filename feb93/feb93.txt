          A LETTER FROM THE COMPUTER SYSTEMS LABORATORY             

			February 1993


INDUSTRY GOVERNMENT OPEN SYSTEMS SPECIFICATION PROPOSED
NIST, the Canadian Government, the World Federation of MAP/TOP
User Groups, and the electric power industry have joined forces
to develop a common open systems specification for the
acquisition of computer networking products and services based on 
international Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) standards.  The
result of this cooperative effort is the Industry Government Open
Systems Specification (IGOSS), now available for public review
and comment.  Later this year, NIST expects to propose IGOSS as
the next version of Federal Information Processing Standard
(FIPS) 146-1, Government Open Systems Interconnection Profile
(GOSIP).

IGOSS will provide common requirements for OSI products and
services and will enable the computer industry to develop
products that meet the requirements of a broad user market.  
IGOSS is expected to become the primary reference for functional
profiles to be issued by the individual IGOSS organizations in
the future.

Comments
The developers of IGOSS invite review and comments on the
technical content of IGOSS.  Send written comments, prior to May
15, 1993, to Gerard Mulvenna, National Institute of Standards and
Technology, Technology Building, Room B217, Gaithersburg, MD 
20899-0001, telephone (301) 975-3631.

Copies of IGOSS may be obtained from the Standards Processing
Coordinator (ADP), National Institute of Standards and
Technology, Technology Building, Room B-64, Gaithersburg, MD 
20899-0001, telephone (301) 975-2816.

To Access IGOSS Electronically
Via anonymous ftp, the address is osi.ncsl.nist.gov
(129.6.48.100).  IGOSS is located in directory /pub/igoss.  The
file names are igoss_v1.asc (ASCII file), igoss_v1.ps (PostScript
file), and igoss_v1.ps.Z (compressed PostScript file).  You must
retrieve one of the PostScript files in order to obtain all
figures.

To access via anonymous FTAM use:  
Paddr={1,1,1,47:0005:80:005a00:0000:0001:e137:080020079efc:00}
userid = anon, realstore = unix

If using ISODE, the corresponding "isoentities" entry is:
osi.ncsl.nist.gov     
filestore NULL \                             
#1/#1/#1/NS+47000580005a0000000001e137080020079efc00

FTAM using RFC-1006 is also supported on osi.ncsl.nist.gov

FEDERAL CRITERIA FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SECURITY 
Also released for public review and comment by NIST and the
National Security Agency (NSA) is the draft Version 1 of the U.S.
Federal Criteria (FC) for Information Technology Security (ITS). 
Version 1 consists of two volumes:  Volume I, "Protection Profile
Development," describes how to write ITS product criteria called
protection profiles; Volume II, "Registry of Protection
Profiles," contains seven protection profiles using the structure
described in volume I.  The FC is the next generation of criteria
intended to supersede the Department of Defense (DoD) Trusted
Computer System Evaluation Criteria (known as the "Orange Book")
which has been the Dod standard and the de facto national
standard for the past decade.

* Different exit() values depending on where and why it terminated. (Send
  via "longjmp()" perhaps?)

* Should atleast doubly verify that the data retrieved from the kernel is
  correct (incase the kernel changed beneath the ident daemon).

* Implement a config file (/etc/identd.conf), enabled via the "-f" flag.

* Implement some way for an external program to register indirect
  pointers. For example a TCP/IP relaying daemon might wanna do this.
  So that the <Identifier> returned will look something like:

      42 , 4711 : USERID : OTHER : foo (fubar.su!bar)

  or:

      42 , 4711 : USERID : OTHER : foo (this.host.se!foo (fubar.su!bar))

  Probably should be implemented using a UNIX domain socket with access
  control.

* Implement some way to encrypt <Identifiers>.

Version 1.9beta.5:

  * contains some support for Convex machines

Version 1.9beta.4:

  * Three modes of operation available.

       	-i ..... Selects the old variant (started from Inetd with "nowait")

 	-w ..... Selects a new variant that is better than the old one. It
		 should be started from Inetd with "wait".

	-b ..... For the poor bastards without a working Inetd. NOT a
		 prefered mode of operation if one can choose...

  * Multiquery mode available, selected with "-m". Please note that this
    violates the IDENT protocol specification as it currently stands. It
    does however seem to work just fine with Dan's authuser library as of
    version 4.0.

  * An much updated manual page that describes some other new command
    line options that are used with the new operation modes.

  * Better error handling internally

  * Does automatic retry if the kernel changed beneath it when looking
    up the connection. Or it tries atleast.

  * Some new command line options:

        -o ..... Don't give away operating system type.
		 Always say "OTHER".

	-e ..... Don't give away informative error messages.
		 Always say "UNKNOWN-ERROR".

 	-n ..... Don't give away user names.
		 Always say the user number (and "OTHER" as opsys type)


PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF YOU CAN MAKE THIS VERSION OF THE PIDENT DAEMON
COMPILE AND RUN ON YOUR SYSTEMS! Just send me a letter where you say
if it works or not and on what hardware/operating system you tried it
on.

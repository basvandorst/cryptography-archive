To build the "in.identd" daemon, do the following steps:

1. If you are running SunOS 4.* goto 5.

2. Check the Makefile to see if there are lines for your OS. If so,
   then comment the lines for SunOS 4.* and uncomment your lines.
   Then goto 5.

3. If your machine/OS has the "KVM" routines (you can find out by
   typing "man kvm_open"), then set "DEFS" to "-DHAVE_KVM" and set
   "LIBS" to the library where the "KVM" routines are located. Then
   goto 5.

4. Else edit the file "paths.h" and hope for the best.

5. Type "make" and watch it build nicely (hopefully).

6. As "root", type "make install". This will copy the executable
   daemon "in.identd" into the destination directory as specified in
   the Makefile (normally /usr/etc) and the man page into the specified
   man directory (normally /usr/man/man8).

   Please make sure that it is executable for the user you specify below
   in step 8! Otherwise it will fail for obvious reasons.

7. Edit /etc/services to contain a line "ident 113/tcp auth". If your system
   is running SunOS, or some other system with NIS (or YP) then cd to
   your YP directory and type "make". (On SunOS 4.*: "cd /var/yp; make").

8. Edit the file /etc/inetd.conf to contain a line (replace "sys" with
   a user with enough rights to READ the kernel memory. Under SunOS 4.*,
   user "sys" is a member of the "kmem" group and is a good choice. If
   you have no "kmem" or "sys" user, then I suggest you create one and
   assign read rights for the group "kmem" to the /vmunix and /dev/kmem
   and /dev/mem "files"):

     ident     stream  tcp  wait  sys   /usr/etc/in.identd in.identd -w -t120

9. Restart the "inetd" daemon. (Can normally be done with a "SIGHUP" signal).

10. Test the daemon by TELNET:ing to "localhost" port 113 and then escape
    to the command level temporarily (normally you can do this by keying
    "Ctrl-] z". Then type "netstat -n | egrep 113" and remember the other
    port number that you will see. Now return to your TELNET session and
    enter "4711 , 113", where you replace 4711 with the number you got from
    "netstat". If things work out ok you should see a response like:

       4711 , 113 : USERID : UNIX : foobar

    Where "foobar" should be your user name. If it doesn't work then
    please send me a bug report at <pen@lysator.liu.se>.

    There is also a small test program in the "tests" subdirectory which
    should do this for you more or less automatically.
    
11. Else all is done and your server should be ready for real world usage.

                          Installation Instructions
==============================================================================

     By default, Netscape expects to live in the directory c:\netscape.  
     The easiest way to install Netscape is to create the c:\netscape 
     directory and unzip the Netscape zip file there.

     If you place Netscape in a directory other than c:\netscape you should
     update the following fields in your INI file:

               [History]
               History File=c:\netscape\mosaic.hst

               [Bookmark List]
               File Location=c:\netscape\bookmark.htm

     If Netscape cannot write these files (for example, if the directory
     doesn't exist) Netscape will still run; however, global history and 
     bookmarks will not be saved between sessions.

* Initialization File
     The zip file for Netscape contains the initialization file netscape.ini,
     which has entries for all of the values you can customize for Netscape. 
     If you have never used any other versions of Mosaic before, you should 
     copy the netscape.ini file to your windows directory.

* Reusing NCSA Mosaic INI files
     If you would like to reuse your initialization file from NCSA Mosaic for
     Windows, you can go into your windows directory and copy mosaic.ini to
     netscape.ini. Netscape will be able to read home page information out of
     the file, but is currently unable to convert NCSA Mosaic hotlists into
     Netscape bookmark lists. If you reuse an old INI file you should make 
     sure you add the fields for "History File" and "File Location" as 
     outlined in the Installation section of this document.

* Please read the release notes under "Help -> Version Information".

* Yes, this is Mozilla.

Summary: SecureDrive outside USA - Canada
Keywords: SecureDrive

I'm from Australia and am looking to get SecureDrive, the IDEA disk
partition encryption application.

Could some one please tell me where I can find in on ftp outside the
USA-Canada, or could some one outside the USA-Canada please mail it to
me.

I would greatly appreciate it.

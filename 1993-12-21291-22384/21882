Well, there's a difference between a minimal specification and a machine
which happens to comply.  Given that most XT's shouldn't generate too much
interference internally anyway, the degree of shielding could easily be
overkill without too much extra expense.  In short, I doubt if one could
learn much of anything about Tempest outside the obvious by examining an
XT.

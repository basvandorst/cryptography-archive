But wouldn't getting the IV require being able to decode a message?  It would
certainly be very bad if sending a message to someone which they could decode
would erode the strength of the secret key, but in the approach I described,
crypto-text alone is sufficient to erode its security.  In any event, it should
be clear that hiding information in a PGP'ed message is relatively trivial and
undetectable [suppose they'd use my approach, but assumed the 1 bit positions
could be gotten by IDEA'ing the first block of the cryptotext with the key
"ClintonIsGod-NOT" and taking bits 0-39 of the result.  Such tampering would be
totally undetectable to anyone without the key "ClintonIsGod-NOT" or careful
inspection of the object code [which could of course be obfuscated].

Well, the current release of ViaCrypt may be good code, but what about 1.1
after NSA gets its tentacles in?  With PGP, every version includes source.
With ViaCrypt, none do.  Will PKP allow PZ to inspect every release version
of PGP and ensure that they're all okay?  And will he provide an MD5 hash of
the version he inspects so everyone will know PKP didn't pull a fast one?

I'm a little embarrassed to mention my private version in 8086 MASM.  I 
haven't accurately timed it on the 486 (33mHz) but it's about 64K/sec 
including I/O.  From the XT speed above, which is the same as mine, my 
guess is that pure machine speed excluding i/o would be comparable.

Not the fastest, but not shabby either.  My lilDES occupies 6000 bytes 
including tables, installs as a tsr, and is callable by far call from 
anything.  I need to put in triple encryption as a primitive operation, 
after learning from this newsgroup of the disgusting speeds that a 
special chip can solve for keys.  Disgusting cheapness of special chip too.

It's not available for the public yet.

Is anybody interested in public discussion of fast implementation tricks?

France cut prices of condoms to encourage youth to use them.  Said Ministry of

condoms, Britons 160 million.  The French used 100 million.  We can catch up
but we must go faster." -- NY Times squib

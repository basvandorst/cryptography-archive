Thanks to John Gilmore and EFF for their FOIA efforts with respect to
clipper. As I read the document Gilmore publishes, it seems quite clear that
the government (and, mirabile dictu, DOD) well understands the issues that
have been raised here and elsewhere, and predicted the objections that would
be raised accurately. Reading between the lines, it also seems that DOD is
sympathetic to many, if not all of the arguments by EFF, CPSR, and others on
the matter.

I commend the paper as a marvel of thorough, detailed, and prescient staff
work, concisely and clearly summarized. We are getting our tax money's worth
out of those involved in preparing that document.

Often the lay public little realizes the excellence and professionalism of
staff and decision work within the government. Especially in the
technical-professional organizations, such as DOD, the work is exemplary and
there is little tolerance for shoddy or amateurish staff work, or for a
failure to represent critical alternative points of view.

The argument goes that amateur radio in the US has legally mandated
purposes, that it is a priviledge granted by the government, and 
encryption or use of codes, (other than those commonly available such
as packet encryption) are a violation of the purposes of amateur radio.

If you want to send coded information, do it on commercial radio.

Or, do what lots of other hams do, break the stupid law.  I personally
think transmitting encrypted data, for the purposes of breaking the
key, would be a lot more fun than T-hunts (contests to find hidden
transmitters.

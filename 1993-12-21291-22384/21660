Finally, a response to the original msg by someone who at least appears
to know something about infosec and the technology.

I'm not going on the limb to back up the original posters story, but
with all the circumstantial "who done it's" aside, I know for a fact that
the types of methods that were reportedly used are possible (and some
well known...used before as Ted conveyed).  If you don't believe it, at
least believe that it is possible.

One other thing I might add...regardless whether I might play around
with PGP or not, if I had a real unbreakable encryption scheme and
tool I would not go around advertising it or making it publicly available,
this of course would be one of my built-in security measures for the
program itself.  But, that would not stop me from actually using it
to encrypt messages when and with whom I have the proper use for it.

And of course I'm not entertaining questions about what I am
specifically referring to in the latter paragraph.

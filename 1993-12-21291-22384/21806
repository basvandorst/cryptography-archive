I got this nifty assignment to make up some questions based off of a
lecture on Miller's primality test.  I'm supposed to make a question
that should take computer/math lay-people about 6 hours to solve.  I was
thinking about asking them to research other methods of prime testing to
find ones that had less trouble with Carmichael numbers.  Or just to
research other fast methods of primality testing.  Could some of you
kind and well educated in the ways of prime-number finding studs forward
me a list of methods and perhaps some sort of bibliography?

much thanks,

My opinions are not the school's, although they should be!

Well, then he's wrong again, because the machine code will not be the
same either. Even two different C compilers will produce different
machine code given the same source, let alone a, say, FORTRAN and a C
compiler, given the (different) sources of two equivalent programs.

This is not cryptanalysis and is not cypher cracking. They could as
well force the recepient to reveal the contents of the encrypted
message. But all this has nothing to do with the crypto newsgroups.

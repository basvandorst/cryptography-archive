That would presuppose a need to keep this info out of the hands of an enemy
so badly that you were willing to permanently lose it yourself under such a
scheme. (Including the possibility of this "dead man switch" kicking in due
to simple human error.)  You'd also have to make sure that you didn't keep an
unencrypted backup copy anywhere.

As for protection against "beating it out of you", that scheme only works if
your enemy KNOWS that any pass phrase info obtained from you would be
useless, even if valid. IOW, if he obtains the passphrase from you, tries
it, and is unable to obtain anything useful from the disk, how does he know
you gave him the right one?  Does he definitely know that you didn't build
in some sort of a backdoor to later retrieve the data later yourself?  Is
the info you seek to protect worth (potentially) dying for?  How much of
this info that you had access to could be recreated from your own memory, if
you were forced to do so?

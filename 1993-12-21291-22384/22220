Actually, I was thinking of using it for ENcryption or steganography, not
cracking.  For example, with a dictionary of 64K words, you could take each
16 bits of ciphertext and represent it with an English word.  It would be
nonsense text, of course, but it might look less like ciphertext to someone's
handy-dandy e-mail scanner designed to record who's sending encrypted
messages via e-mail.  Of course, if they were to use a STYLE CHECKER... <g>

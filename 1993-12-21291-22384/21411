It is well to remember that Sternlight has this bug up his ass about
PGP;  it seems to infuriate him that such educational and useful freeware
should have been distributed.

There is one thing that is for sure, and that is that the lead the NSA
has enjoyed in crypto is primarily through security by obscurity.
It is easy to be ahead of most other people when you work in a vacuum.
They would clearly like to maintain their lead through the same time honored
and successful techniques, hence the nonsense with the clipper chip.

However, today crypto is recognized as being much more broadly useful
and a lot more highly talented people are openly working on the subject.
PGP is based on ideas that have so far survived close public scrutiny
by these experts, and much of this is a matter of public record.

The likelyhood that NSA *may* have the technical ability to crack
PGP should realistically be far down in the list of fears anyone
should have.

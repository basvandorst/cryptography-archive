I think they use Rabin-Miller which is slightly stronger than little Fermat and eliminates most Carmichael numbers too! Actually most sensible key generators use some form of Rabin-Miller and the pseudoprimes (i.e. composites passing tests) which are not recognized by these tests are called "strong" or "Rabin-Miller strong" pseudoprimes.

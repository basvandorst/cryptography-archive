GOST is a Soviet secret-key algorithm.  It is not DES, but it is very similar
in structture.  The key is longer, for one.  Another interesting thing is
that the s-boxes are not specified in the algorithm; you have to go to some
state organization for your personal s-boxes.  (Presumably the state can
give secure s-boxes to the people they like, and insecure ones to the people
they don't.)  

I have a Russian document describing this spec, and a partial translation.
No, it is not digital, so I can't post it.

What are you talking about?

Of course they have to identify the participants before those same
participants can produce the report!  Or do you imagine the participants
will be escorted into a locked room with armed guards, have pens shoved
in their hands, and told to sign the previously prepared report?

(I'm not saying that couldn't happen, but I certainly not going to
lose any sleep over it.  If things are that far gone, chatter over
the internet isn't going to make much of a difference).

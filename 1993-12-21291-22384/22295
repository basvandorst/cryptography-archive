Well, I know it cant be picked up on an ordinary scanner (you just get 
noise).  It does have an encryption, so someone will have to specifically 
want to listen to YOUR phone, Im sure it can be broken, but I dont worry 
about it.  If you want complete protection, I wouldnt use a cordless phone, 
and get a professional scrambler. If you're worried about the local-yocal with 
his 900mhz scanner, this will keep him out.

I have heard that Cinncinati-Microwave (Passport/Escort co.) makes a 
broad-spectrum (for around $400) that broadcasts on several freq's at once.  I 
dont know much about it.  I have been told, like anything, this can be 
listened to as well.  That is, if someone really wants to listen to it.

As for the VTech, I have owned one for about a year (the one with 
speakerphone, dialer, etc. on base) and it offers incredible clarity and 
range.  I have owned several quality cordless's that claimed "Clarity-plus", 
etc. and this beats them all.  It is digital, so it does digitize the signals, 
so there is NO static.  I would recommend it.  You can find them at best-buy, 
etc.  And I believe AT&T has one available (I heard that it is a VTech in an 
AT&T case, it does resemble the VTech layout).  For around $200, its worth 
it.  The clarity and range make it worth the money.  Also, it works great 
near the computer/monitor as well.  Many cordless's go nuts. 

BTW: Anyone seen a 900mhz cordless headset?  I would like to get a 
     cordless headset, but the only one available (that I know of) is the      
     RadioHack, and its the standard Mhz.

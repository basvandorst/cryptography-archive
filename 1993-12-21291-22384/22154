   As a more immediate concern to me:  How do I check up on the contents
of a tamper-proof system, to ensure that it's not doing something I
don't want it to do?  Ie, if I have a tamper-proof dongle on the back
of my PC that allows me to decrypt whichever books I want to read when
I want them, how do I verify that the dongle isn't keeping a permanent
record of which books I read?

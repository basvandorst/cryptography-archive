I maintain my original assertion.

It is impossible to maintain exponential growth indefinitely. Back-of-
envelope calculation (well, actually, dc) follows:

2^128 = 340282366920938463463374607431768211456

Assuming we can try n keys per second, and want to try all the keys in k
years, we must have

k*n = 10790283070806014188970529154990 ~= 10^31

Assuming a reasonable time (1 year), you'd have to be able to try that many
keys per second. And if you think about this you'll probably agree that it is  
physically impossible.

If you still don't agree--well, what more can I say.

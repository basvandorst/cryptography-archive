This is going to become yet another Urban Legend (tm). Why people are
so reluctant to check the facts before spreading a rumor?

First of all, the documentation of PGP does not say that this company
can crack *any* PKZIP encrypted archive. It says that they can crack
only "the built-in encryption schemes used by WordPerfect, Lotus
1-2-3, MS Excel, Symphony, Quattro Pro, Paradox, and MS Word 2.0". It
also says that the author of the cracking package, Eric Thompson, says
that "PKZIP files can often be easily broken". "Often" is the keyword.
It means - when a short or a dictionary password is used. There *are*
weaknesses in the PKZIP algorithm, but I have yet to see a program
that can crack an ARBITRARY ZIP archive in reasonable time.

Actually, there is a third approach which the NSA has started using:
Simply encase the entire building in a TEMPEST enclosure and save LOTS of
money buying TEMPEST hardware.  When the Building One renovation was done
out at Ft. Meade, they actually built a shell AROUND the original
building.  The glass is multi-layer Gold-foil and glass and is bonded to
the framework creating a *very* good Faraday cage. It turns out that
TEMPTEST-rated hardware is so much more expensive to buy, the incredible
building mods paid for themselves reasonably soon.  Also forcing the
matter, however, was that modern computer and workstation manufacturers
were starting to simply decline to do the work necessary for one of the
TEMPEST ratings since the market was so small.

PS - if you've ever had the misfortune to use a TEMPEST "screened" color
monitor on, say, a Sun workstation, you know why the users in Building One
were delighted with the decision to punt TEMPEST hardware.

My two cents worth: I've been toying with the idea of supporting
use of cheap, readily-available, solar-powered calculators as challenge-
response devices. I'm thinking of the kind of thing you can buy at "K-Mart"
for $3.00.  My company would be willing to support these inside of our
SafeWord challenge/response authentication product line if there is 
enough interest. I am thinking of a system where the user would memorize
a PIN (maybe 5 digits) and would receive a short random challenge (maybe
3 digits). The user would enter the PIN and challenge into the
calculator and then perform some kind of mathematical function on the
combination (hopefully involving just 1 or 2 keystrokes) and would then
respond with SOME but not ALL of the displayed digits. Different users
could use different mathematical functions (sqrt, sin, tan, sqrt twice,
etc.) and would respond with different digits (carefully thought through
so they change a lot with small changes in challenges). An attacker that
didn't know the user's memorized PIN would have a pretty tough time figuring
out which calcultor button and displayed digit positions were being used
by an individual user.

The disadvantages are obvious: Not nearly as secure as a system built on
custom cryptographically based crytpocalculators, and more keypresses. But
it seems more convenient than carrying around a list of passwords on a
piece of paper. Human factors might make it more resistant to sharing
passwords too....

Since SafeWord software is portable, and already available on pretty much
all of the commercially important hosts, and already supports a variety
of authentication devices, this would result in a commercially supported
migration path all the way through both ends of the security spectrum.

If you're interested, please contact me and I'll try to put this on our
development fast-track.

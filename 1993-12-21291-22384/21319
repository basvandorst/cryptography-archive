Subject: Block encryption modes
Lines: 30


Is there any theoretical data available on the relative strengths of the
ECB, CBC, and CFB modes for block ciphers?  Intuitively, it would seem as if
ECB was the least secure mode.  Switching to CBC with a SECRET,
pseudo-random 64 bit IV would seem to make a brute force attack 2^64 times
more difficult (effectively adding 64 bits to the "key" length).  Is that
true, or am I overlooking something?  Also, CBC and CFB would seem to make a
plain text attack more difficult if the known text were at the END of the
file, since the file would (seemingly) need to be decrypted block by block,
in sequence, until the last block was reached vs. a "random access" attack
on the last block, as would be possible with an ECB implementation.

What are the relative strengths and weaknesses of CFB with respect to CBC?

Can someone briefly explain the significance of "error propagation" in these
modes?  Does it merely affect ciphertext that becomes garbled in
transmission, or could it also affect a "garbled" (or wrongly-guessed) IV as
well?

Thanks.

Precisely.  It's interesting to note that the Amateur Radio Service was
actually shut down for the duration of World War II out of concern that it
would be used by enemy spies and saboteurs.  If you shut down the
legitimate transmitters, then the clandestine ones are easier to spot.  It's
hard to practice steganography when transmissions of any sort are prohibited.

OTOH, when the real news of Tiananmen Square was smuggled out of China using
FAX machines on unsecure dial-up lines, one wonders whether a modern
"information embargo" is really possible anymore.

I think you should read Knuth, Seminumerical Algorithms, where he
talks about random number generators. He illustrates one that _looks_
awfully random, but for some values of the seed produces very short
cyclic sequences.

You need to have _proof_, that for any chosen values of the seed, you
will not end up with a short-length periodic sequence. I think this
would be a very difficult property to prove on an algorithm of this
form. Testing is a poor substitute for proof: if there were a
10^8-length cycle, the code would be easy to break, but you'll never
find it by testing.

You also need proof that any several million sequences in a row, do
not reveal the current seed. Proving this to be computationally
infeasible is _hard_, for an algorithm such as yours.

DES is only an instance of G-DES so all techniques that applies
to G-DES also applies to DES. With one exception it appears that
there is no speed disadvantage by considering G-DES instead of DES.

The exception is one technique that takes advantage of the special
structure of the expansion permutation, E, in DES, and the paper I
cited mentions that as well.

From the benchmarks it seems that the speedup you get by going
from the ordinary substitution tables to subkey specific tables
is a factor of 2.

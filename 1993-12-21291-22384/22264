After reading the descriptions of the different block ciphers in Applied
Cryptography, I started wondering about variations.  One that came to mind
was:

1> take 32 bits of plaintext, XOR with 32 bits of hashed password/phrase.
2> take 4-bit sections of result, and rotate them: 1234 >> 2341 (or 4123)
3> put the 4-bit sections back together

Caveats: hashed password/phrase would have to be some multiple of 4 bits
(any shortage would 'wrap around'). Optionally, rotate the bits, THEN XOR.

This seems too simple; what blazingly obvious thing am I overlooking?

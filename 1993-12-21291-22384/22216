Does it really need to pass a chi square test? I am assuming you are
comparing the output of the function to an uniform distribution using
chi square as the figure of merit. What I am wondering is if I have a
"suitably unpredictable" function, isn't this good enough whether or
not the chi square value (based on an uniform distribution) is met?

I am thinking maybe a better test for a pseudo random function output
would be the correlation between sequential values over some useful span
Clearly, the correlation between the nth byte and the next byte is not
a good enough test.

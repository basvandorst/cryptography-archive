 I am not claiming that PGP cannot be made to give good security.
 I am claiming that the PGP cipher allows the ordinary user to use
 it in ways which are deceptively weak.  The user expects strength
 from the simple use of a serious cipher.

 If we are going to have a central validating authority for a
 particular group, we will have substantial overhead expense.
 Sure, getting individual keys will be easier than a private-key
 alternative, but will the overall effort be less?  And is it
 better to require some sort of central authority for security,
 or rely upon each channel establishing independent security?

 Let's be careful here:  My criticism of PGP has nothing to do with
 establishing *identity* or *intent* in the remote party.

 Communicating with a single party, even if that party has bad
 intentions and reports the communication, is structurally
 distinct from having communications monitored by a spoofer.
 Weak key-validation enables spoofing, and the PGP key-validation
 is appallingly weak.

 Really?  Well, we normally expect a 56-bit-key DES cipher to
 give each key one chance in 7E16 of being "our" key.  Thus, the
 DES cipher demands that The Opponent invest 2^55 or 4E16 key-trials
 (on average) to "break" our message.  It is because of this expense
 that we assume that the chance of someone reading our message is
 close to zero, in the sense that few entities could or would invest
 that amount of effort.  But since DES is notoriously "weak," this
 expense cannot be considered sufficient for security.

 When we have an "absolutely trusted" party, what is the probability
 that our trust has failed?  I contend that human interactions like
 trust are best described as "one chance in a million" or so.
 (Actually, if The Opponent were to invest a fraction of the effort
 required for a technical attack, this value probably could be
 reduced considerably.)  In this way, the IDEA cipher (with a
 putative strength of 2^127) is weakened from one chance in 2E38
 (which is "too expensive" or "impossible") to one chance in 1E6
 (which is possible), or less.  Thus, I claim that these sorts of
 human assurances simply have no place in cryptographic protocols.

 Public-key ciphers *can* be a significant advantage, *provided they
 are operated properly*.  My criticism is directed toward the design
 of the PGP key-validation protocol, as being inherently weak and
 misleading the ordinary user into misperceptions of strength.

 Even *if* we actually do validate public keys with their issuer
 on an international basis, there *still* is *some* possibility
 that we are contacting a spoofer and not the issuer.  Even if
 this probability is fantastically low, it is still likely to be
 far beyond what we normally expect from cryptographic security.

 The lack of a *cryptographic* validation protocol inherently
 damages the security available to most users of PGP.  And because
 of the fad or the cachet "public key," most users do not realize
 their vulnerability.

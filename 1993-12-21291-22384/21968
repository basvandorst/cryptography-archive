Phil Karn and another chap at Bellcore whose name escapes me right now
invented something called S-Key which accomplishes much of what
is being discussed here without most of the problems.  They have 
been using it for a couple of years now.  I think there is a document
describing it up for FTP somewhere - thumper.bellcore.com maybe?
Phil? are you reading this?

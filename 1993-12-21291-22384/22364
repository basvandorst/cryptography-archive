I agree. They really did a lot of thinking about it.

Then why is the goddamned thing classified? Why is the government
hiding from its own public. I'm getting awfully tired of the
government rubberstamping as classified anything that they might be
the slightest bit embarrassed about.

There ought to be severe criminal penalties for unnecessarily
classifying information and documents such as this.

Hi all,

  i would like references to a program (and ideally source)
  for an encrypted filesystem under DOS.

  i know stacker supports password protection but i dont want
  to have to stack my data store drive just to get file system
  protection.

  also i dont know how good the encryption is in stacker.

Karl

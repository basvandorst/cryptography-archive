I have proposed to my management that we put together a challenge/response
system for authenticiation of telnet/pop etc based on the PEM structures

DEK-Info and Key-Info

Basically having got the username, the service generates a new DES key and
uses the PEM encodings to return it to the user, whose access unit, decrypts
it using their private key and re-encrypts it using the services public key
and sends it back. 

Once the service end has decrypted the returned data, it knows that the user
knows the users private key and they now have a DES key that they can use
for comunications privacy. Are any of the telnet options available for
negociation of privacy?

Pete.

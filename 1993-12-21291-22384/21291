Hi again,

    In reference to my message "Announcing a New Encryption 
Algorthim/Announcing the DEA Algorthim"
-
Peter Gutmann wrote, "It might be a good idea to think of a new name for 
this...this could cause some confusion about what DEA 2.0 really is..."

In regards to this, I have already contacted Victor Sadowsky (the author 
of DEA 2.0 and informed him that he needs to post his algorthim onto the 
net. This will be done in the near future. Again, I am only passing on
this info in his behalf. I will also let him know about the possible
conflict with the DES-pc name. I can state on his behalf that the DEA
2.0 algorthim is NOT in any way related to or derived from the DES.
He is claiming an original development in this algorthim. When I post
the algorthim for peer review, please send all comments and reviews
to the author at the address that will be provided. Of course, let's
discuss it amoung ourselves also.
So, in conclusion, look for the posting in the near future and enjoy 
hours of cryptoanayltic fun!
Thanks for the ideas and info, Peter.

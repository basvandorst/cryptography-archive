(I hope I've got the title right, the book is packed away right now).

Has anybody typed in the programs from this book? I know that they are
pretty poor, but they do have their uses. I lost the disk I'd been using on
my old 8-bit, and I'd rather not re-type everything again.

If anybody does have them in machine readable form, please email me.
Thanks.

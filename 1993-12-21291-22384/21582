Can someone please post, or email to me the restrictions on the use of
public key cryptography as a result of PKP's patent.
[ Or if a report/article of the appropriate nature is available for
anonymous ftp, please point me towards it. ]

My current understanding that PKP have a patent on the use of public key
cryptography for communications but this is a little vague.

thanks
JonT

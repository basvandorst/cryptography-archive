At the Dayton Hamvention quite a few years ago, I bought a surplus
Heath/Zenith XT keyboard that had been Tempested. Heavy metal shielded
D-style connector pair in the line to the standard DIN connector,
slightly thicker shielded coil cord, extra shielding around the edges
of the keyboard, etc. I finally retired it when I retired the 8088 PC
it was plugged into.

So I'm inclined to believe other stories that Tempested equipment is
not restricted, and is available elsewhere on the surplus market.

There's a myth floating around that Tempesting your computers is
somehow illegal. It's not. The precise specs for Tempest may be
classified, but there is no law against shielding your computers. In
fact, the US FCC requires that every PC sold meet minimal shielding
standards to limit radio and TV interference. This "Part 15" shielding
is nowhere near as extensive and effective (or expensive!)  as true
Tempest. But I'm sure that as a result of it, it's not *quite* as
trivial to eavesdrop on modern computer equipment as Van Eck did on
completely unshielded equipment a decade ago.

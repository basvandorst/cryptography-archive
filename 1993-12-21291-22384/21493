Are you sure? What would be needed is access to:

		- Your passphrase

		- Your secret key

		- The traffic.

We can assume that the traffic won't change. Probably your secret key
won't either. Since any passphrase changed or not will operate the secret 
key it doesn't matter how often you change your passphrase if you don't 
change the key.

Do I begin to make you nervous?? :-)--

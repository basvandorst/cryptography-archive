Interesting idea.  (No pun intended.)  I'm still looking for some info on
IDEA, like a "validation suite" and some clues as to what constitutes a
"weak key" in IDEA.

As for XORing the key, since the XOR is a reversible operation, wouldn't
XORing a key be as likely to create a weak key as cure one?

I don't buy this. I can't possibly imagine an opponent figuring,
"OK, he's got a random number generator based on a noise diode.
We'll set up a 50-Watt transmitter in his floor, and reduce his
password space from 2^56 to 2^55. Of course he won't have a clue
that we're running this much power literally at his feet..."

So put the diode in a rf-proof box. Big deal.

This sounds like some hare-brained CIA scheme like poisoning
Castro's beard-- a $100K outlay with zero return.

Strong pseudoprimes used to be Carmichael numbers. Currently one reads more and more often "strong pseudoprimes" for composites passing one or a given set of Rabin - Miller tests. I perfectly agree the term is confusing, but I did not introduce it, I only mentioned its being used! Maybe someone more influential should try and bring some order in the forest of pseudoprimes growing. By now one can talk about Fermat, Rabin-Miller, Lucas, elliptic pseudoprimes (nothing at all is known about the last, except th
at they might exist) ... and how many more ?

This is wrong - the fraction 1/2 corresponds to Solovay-Strassen. The probability for Rabin - Miller is 1/4. Actually the chance for a test number to be composite after passing k Rabin - Miller tests is far lower than (1/4)^k. I think I.Damgard has proved something like 2^(-56) for k=6 and the theory is more complex than the one used by Rabin (note we talk about an enhancement not an infirmation of Rabin's statement).

ok., with 25% and 4^-M instead of 50% and 2^-M.

The probleme of producing a solution (x,y) of this equation is exactly the
problem of breacking the old Ong Schnorr Shamir signature scheme. This can
be done using Polard Schnorr algorithm.

x^2 = ay^2 + by + c is equivalent to x^2 = a ( y + b/(2a) )^2 + c - b^2/(4a)

When c = b^2/(4a), the problem is equivalent to compute a square root of a,
thus it is equivalent to factorize the modulus.

Otherwise, Polard Schnorr algorithm gives solution.

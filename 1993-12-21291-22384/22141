I don't see much of a difference beteen tamper proof modules and
encrypted files.  So this problem seems isomorphic to that addressed
by the Clipper chip proposal, which has beaten to death here already
and even has its own newsgroup.  Substituting "copyright infringers"
for "drug dealers" in the "bogeyman" field of the question doesn't
seem to make much difference either.

The various comments on CRCs are correct but incomplete.

If you give an attacker a message with a CRC of zero then he can modify
subsequent messages that use the same CRC polynomial without needing to
discover the polynomial.

If you give him a message with a known non-zero CRC, but without the
polynomial then he may be able to construct further messages for which
the CRC value is zero.  These messages may also be used to corrupt
subsequent messages.

Several people stated that in addition to the desired modification
(desired by the attacker) it is also necessary to corrupt a number of
bits equal to the length of the CRC polynomial.  Note that this is a
worst case estimate of the number of bits that may need to be
corrupted.  If the initial corruption is divisible by the CRC
polynomial then no further bits need to be corrupted.  Note that if two
messages are divisible by the polynomial, so will their sum be.

Conclusion: I would advise strongly against relying upon a CRC, even
with a secret polynomial, to protect against an intelligent attacker.

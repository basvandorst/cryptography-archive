Perhaps this is a bit obscure to those who do not know the story.

Craig Shergold (I think that is his name) at one time was 7 years old and had
cancer.  He wanted to do something interesting, so he asked that people send
him postcards.  That request has travelled the globe several times for many
years.  Craig is about 9 or 10 years older now, about 17 or so, and no longer 
has cancer, fortunately.  He received so many postcards that Guiness no longer
has that category open for records.  His post office will hate you if you send
any to him.  He does not want any more.

The business card thing is an evil scam.  Some company in the US decided to cash
in on the sympathy and send out letters asking for business cards instead of 
postcards.  A great way to get business addresses for your mailing list, and
perhaps to sell to other businesses.  I hope the person who thought this up
was fired, but that is also old news.  To sum up:  Do Not Send Postcards.
Do Not Send Business Cards.  Stop sending this letter around; it is Old News.

Is there anyone out there who has some sets of random numbers?  A million
of them or so would be nice, but a smaller list would be acceptable. 
With the recent talk about hardware RNG's, I figure that someone must
have built one and has some numbers lying around.  I am doing some Monte
Carlo-type testing, and I don't want to have to build and test a
generator before I can get down to work.  If you can help me out, send me
e-mail at mitchell@ncsa.uiuc.edu.  Thanks in advance.

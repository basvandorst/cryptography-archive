I read this question as "the secret key ring (secring.pgp) is
available, but not the pass phrase".  Secring.pgp contains the
passphrase encrypted RSA secret key info.  It is encrypted by the IDEA
cipher using the passphrase and is vulnerable to cryptanalysis of IDEA
and to dictionary and guessing attacks against the pass phrase.
No other vulnerabilities are obvious, but in cryptography, this
never means anything.

Please describe these methods in detail.  As I read the original post,
it represented substantial advances in computer science applicable in
a wide variety of fields.

What paranoid piffle.  After all, Rivest, Shamir and Adleman seem to
be out and about and I haven't heard of their houses being confiscated
lately.  Ditto anyone who has suggested triple encryption DES.  That
includes a lot of people in sci.crypt; I think it includes me.
So far, so good.  My house is still standing and I'm not on a first
name basis with government investigative agencies.

The original post suggested things that, were they possible, could
simply refute Turing's Halting problem theorums.  If all the compilers
of the world have been modified to recognize PGP source, then that's
pretty nifty stuff.  It either can't work or has some very, very 
unexpected shortcut and one that should be trivial to bypass, to boot.

If all this really works as stated, while they are at it, why can't the 
compiler writers get rid of all of my bugs, since comparable intelligence 
is required unless you assume that no one anywhere anytime meddles with 
the source in any way.  Right.

I know of no procedure that can deterministically verify, in general,
that any two programs always produce the same result.  Last time I checked,
that was a Halting Problem equivalent, wasn't it?

I'm not even sure that there are sufficiently advanced pattern recognition
programs to recognize that a given source code is "enough like" PGP and
so that a trap door could be deterministically inserted in the right place.
While I can't rule it out of bounds, I would say that the effect on compile
times of arbitrary programs would have been noticed, never mind that I can't
think of how such a program would really work well enough.

Do you actually program computers for a living?  This is pretty far
out of bounds. . .

If you don't want the laughter to continue, keep it in alt.conspiracy
and take it out of sci.crypt.

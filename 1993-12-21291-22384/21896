Don't flame me too badly if this turns out to be a real dumb question...
I just got Applied Cryptography, and when I got to the section of Simple 
XOR ciphers and the description of how to break them I ran into some 
confusion.  I understand the first and second steps ( I think) but once 
you've got all this Plaintext XORed with itself how do you decrypt it?
Oh yeah, should I mention ITAR, PRG, or Tempest to fit in with the rest 
of the posts around here <g>.

There are a number of significant differences:

1. If someone at a market does the above, they can lose their job. Moreover,
they have a good chance of being observed.

2. Those who eavesdrop on your mail are already performing an illegal act in
many jurisdictions. Thus the set of eavesdroppers is largely populated by
lawbreakers. The chances of one of them further breaking the law by using
your credit card number is, I think, higher than that of the set of market
employees, which have about as many lawbreakers as the general population
(or even fewer since they are gainfully employed).

Since this subject is not strictly sci.crypt, note the followup line.

	The entire idea behind a cryposystem is to protect data long
enough for it to become useless.  Do you think it matters to the platoon
commander if his battle plan is read two days after the battle?  NO!

	Given enough time <-opertive phrase| any system can be broken, but
you don't care if your bank robery plans are seen eight years latter - the
statute of limitations has run.  PGP is the best thing, in common use,
that I have seen.

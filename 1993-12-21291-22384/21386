The code is easy 
for (i=1,i<2^56,1++){ if(!strcmp(des(-1,e,i),"uncrypted e")) break;}
or something like thati(Yes this is a rather symbolic bit of program)
. However the time cost is a bit severe.

2^56=10^17, so at 10^6 des/sec, that's only 10^11 sec=10^5 years.
This of course assumes that you have both the encrypted an the plain
text handy for at least 8 bytes. If not you also need a program which
will recognize when you have somethng sensible or not- agfin a time
spender.
Believe me if it could be done on an alpa, the banks would more or less
shut down till they had repaced DES.

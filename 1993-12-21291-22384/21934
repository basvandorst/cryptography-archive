      My earlier illustrations of the "easy" factoring idea were
intentionally at a very low level so that readers of these postings
could verify the substance of the idea with only a modest computing
asset. However, to accomodate the skeptics, a more substantial example
is in order. Here is one at the 19-digit level:

      N=153 722 867 280 912 930 1
N is a product of two primes but IS ITSELF A PSEUDOPRIME to the base of
2. It is not a Carmichael number.
Select (randomly) another prime, R,
       R=488 382 673
Form a product M=N*R
       M=750 755 848 238 764 986 825 001 573
Select an exponent e, subject to condition (e,phi(M))=1, and construct
a dummy RSA system (e,M,d),
       e=65537
       d=508 106 498 320 744 666 165 857 473
This dummy RSA system functions OK. Check it out!
      With (e,M,d) as inputs the algorithm of DeLaurentis(Cryptologia,1984)
yields a factor of N (715 827 883) in just three (random) trials with the
final base found to be,
      a=312 869 93

      Examples at even a higher level are solicited.

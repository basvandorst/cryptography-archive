I'm not sure whether we are talking about the same thing, but a
program named PKCrack is available from our ftp site:

ftp.informatik.uni-hamburg.de:/pub/virus/texts/crypt/pkcrack.zip

However, it does dictionary attack (not pure brute-force), is supplied
in C source and is not necessarily MS-DOS based - can be compiled with
many C compilers under different systems. I have not checked how
portable exactly it is, though.

Oh, if the archive contains 3-4 (or more) files, all encrypted with the 
same password (which is often the case), you still can use brute force 
with the same effectiveness as with the old PKZIP version.

As I wrote in another message, the numbers were actually 7 and 6; not
8 and 7.

Nah, a much faster (e.g., 1000 times faster) machine will not help
very much. A better cryptanalysis of the PKZIP encryption algorithm is
needed and more clever methods than brute force should be used.

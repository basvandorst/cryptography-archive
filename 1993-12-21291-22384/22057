Bobby Ray Inman was the first--and other than Gen. Odom the 
only--director of NSA who tried to let eny light shine on the place. 
According to Bamford, he also tried to reduce NSA's extreme homophobia 
though the effort wass cut short by Reagan's election and Inman's 
selection as DDCI. 

The two companies he worked for were MCT, a research consortium, and 
Westmark, a high-tech holding company. Niether was terribly successful 
under his leadership. In general, he has been far more successful in 
government than in the private sector.

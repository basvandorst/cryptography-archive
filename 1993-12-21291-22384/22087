: ordinary phrases, not necessarily cliches or hackneyed expressions, however.

The Moby Words product has a file of 160,000 phrases that
I thought would be used to flag and eliminate cliches.  Ironically a
customer of mine using this data to flag cliches is doing it because
his customers want to *verify* that they are using the cliche 'correctly'(!)

Another reader suggested that automatic spelling correctors and OCR
parsers might very care about the 10,000th word in a frequency list.
In my experience, my customers who are doing OCR with intelligence
use several of the Moby lists to focus in on the correct word.

The Moby Part-of-Speech list is most frequently cited as second more useful
to the 1,000 words sorted by frequency in doing smart OCR. If you know two
articles rarely occur side-by-side 'Paris in the the spring' then you can
rank the word to recognized as not likely to be an article immediately after
you have parsed one.

Baloney, so someone broke in to my house and deleted the old PGP and copied
a new one into my BBS? Sure. Not one byte changed either. Cool trapdoor.

And having the trapdoor in the compiler is SO SMART since it will then only
recognize the original source and not something you have changed in it
yourself. (And why the hell not get an old compiler?)

I think I saw Elvis last week too.

(This is a stupid as it gets)

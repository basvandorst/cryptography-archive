In the sci.crypt sense, none of these phones are 'encrypted'.  The cheap
Topaz types (usually selling at $200) do something to digitize the signal
so scanners can't listen.  The better ones (like Cincinnatti Microwave's)
do frequency hopping and digitize the signal.

But both are probably safe enough to give out credit card numbers...

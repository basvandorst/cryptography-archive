Hello,

I was wondering if anyone has any good C code to compute prime numbers.
The numbers I will be dealing with at this time are around 10 to 12 digits
long.

I have read about the theory of the Solovay and Strassen primality test
and I would like to use this method if possible.

Thanks for any help anyone can give me.

(By the way, I am writing a simple form of the rsa algorithm using only 
10 digit numbers instead of hundred digit numbers.)

Ya know, there's a point where governrment bocomes idiocy, because they
simply don't understand how things really work.
If I had the brains to develop a new cryptographic program, I'd do it
here, in my own home, and on a night like tonight, it would be propogated
to nearly every country in the world.  Within about ten minutes.
Even if I had that mentl capability, it would propogate so fast that it
would be entirely useless for a group like the CIA or NSA to find me, let
alone prosecute me, or impound my computer.  It'd be over.
Must be damn frustrating to the officials.
And I kinda like that.

No, Robbie was the star of "Forbidden Planet", co-starring Leslie Neilson.

Robbie also performed bit parts in several low budget movies with one more
supporting role in a Rod Sterling episode of "The Twilight Zone" before
retiring to an obscure office of Dick Smith Electronics in Southern
California. His whereabouts were lost when Dick Smith folded all the 
USA stores.

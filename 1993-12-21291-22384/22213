I am curious regarding the Apple software. My understanding is that it is
interoperable with MacRipem as your posr implies. The current MacRipem has
a built in ability to prepare a certification request to send to RSA via 
email. I have done so and received a certificate by return email. What is
different between this certificate and the one available via the Apple 
software? If there is no difference why would any one want to pay $25 a pop?
If there is a difference, does this represent some limitation on being
compatible with MacRipem?

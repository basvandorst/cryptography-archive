: It means that with this board you'll be able to generate a keypair in
: about a second, instead of the current a couple of minutes. (More
: exactly, my '486 needed 3.5 min to generate a 1024-bit test keypair.)

Guessing that David may have been asking about what this new Cruncher
board means for the _security_ of these keys--a reasonable
question--rather than the time to generate them, here goes:

* boards like this should have minimal effect on the security of RSA:
directly factoring a 1024-bit number (300+ decimal digits) remains
intractable by known methods...the current status is, I believe, a
129-digit number (just one of them, of course) which was factored in
about a year of work by hundreds of workstations ganged together. A
speedup of 1000, or even a million, in each of these workstations
would only push the reachable limit to something in the 140-digit
range. 300-digit numbers remain safe.

(An interesting calculation is what the modulus needs to be so that
factoring cannot be done in the age of the Univers even if every
particle is put to work in the computation....I believe it turns out
to be around 2000 digits or somesuch...but don't trust my memory.)

* and interestingly, the advantage always lies with the key generator,
not the factorer (the attacker). A 1000x speedup up in certain kinds
of integer math will allow even longer keys (moduli) to be effectively
used---the attackers job will rise exponentially (roughly).

* so, faster computers make RSA even stronger, practically speaking.

I hope this helps.

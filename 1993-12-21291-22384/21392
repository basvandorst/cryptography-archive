Not so fast! Using the same line of reasoning as the SKIPJACK review panel: 
If we assume that DES can be cracked by brute force today, and we assume 
that hardware speed doubles every 18 months, then the time required for 
IDEA to become as vulnerable as DES is today is (128 - 56) * 1.5 = 108 
years. Now, if NSA was able to crack DES 108 years ago. . .

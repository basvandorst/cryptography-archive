Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, tits.

I should point out that the FCC prohibits a lot more than just
those seven words.  And in the last six years or so the regulations
have been made vaguer and vaguer, and changed almost constantly, so
that you never know for sure whether you're violating them or not.

O.K.  So you wouldn't say simply that a number n is a strong 
pseudoprime, but that "n is Miller-Rabin strong for x".

It is correct as proven in the reference.

Careful - the way I phrased the statement is that 1/2 is a lower
bound on the probability of detecting a composite.  1/4 is an upper 
bound on the chance of a composite n passing for prime.
You are right that I could have claimed 3/4, ( I didn't have a 
reference or proof handy at the time.  It's proven in Knuth section 
4.5.4 exercise 22)

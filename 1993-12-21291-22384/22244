Does there exist a simple, stand-alone encrypted remote login package?
I'm thinking of something that gives you approximately what Kerberos's
klogin -x does, except without needing a kdc host (and without providing
authentication at all).  The idea is to discourage passive (non-spoofing)
monitors on the various networks that your packets may traverse.  The ideal
installation would not require any privileged access on the target host.

Operation would involve establishing an rsh or rexec (or whatever)
connection to fire up the ``remote'' piece of the package which then
uses, maybe, DH to get a shared session key.  The rest of the session
could be DES encrypted.  I realize there are various problems with this
(e.g., the initial connection lacks real authentication) but it could still
improve on the current situation.

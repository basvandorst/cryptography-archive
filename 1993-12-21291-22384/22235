I don't think the issue was the exporting of cryptographic materials
out of the U.S.

FCC regulations trace their heritage back to the Communications Act of
1936 (I may have the year wrong).  The idea behind the law was that the
airwaves are public property, and as such need to be regulated for the
public good.  From this idea comes a lot of interesting regulations.

You can't have a monopoly of broadcast stations in any local area.  You
need to continually show that your station serves the public interest
(that's why you hear all those public-affairs talk shows at 4 a.m. on
your favorite radio station.)  You can't arbitrarily crank up the power
or jump from frequency to frequency in order to get a bigger market.
(Interestingly, you can't turn the power *down* either -- then you're
wasting the resource that perhaps could be better used by someone
else.)  A portion of the FM band is reserved for noncommercial purposes,
as are the ham bands.

Among these regulations are various regulations against private
point-to-point communications.  What you broadcast is for everybody to
hear.  Ham and CB operators are allowed to address communications to
specific individuals, but they still have to transmit in the clear.

(A lot of these restrictions were scaled back in recent decades.  Ham
operators are now allowed to transmit image and tty data, which can
only be read by those with special equipment.  Satelite operators are
now allowed to encrypt their programs.)

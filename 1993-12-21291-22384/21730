I have written such a program last year, but a few months ago
my harddisk at home has crashed.  So I can't include it in this
posting.
It takes as input: a file, the CRC polynomial, the intended CRC sum and
the position of the first of the 32 bits to be changed.
The coefficient of x^0 in the polynomial must be 1.  Otherwise the
lowest bit of the CRC sum is simply the last bit of the file and can't
be affected by changing bits earlier in the file.  (This requirement
is not necessary if the 32 bits are the last 32 bits of the file.)

The solving of the system if linear equations modulo 2 was done
with the algorithm of Gauss.
The program was rather short (1-2 screens full, as I recall it).
Anyone who has some basic knowledge in linear algebra can
write it on an afternoon.

I had thought of using 32 _arbitrary_, not necessarily consecutive,
bits.  I cannot prove this at once, but if I was not mistaken, this is
possible, if the polynomial p has only the factors x^0 and p
(such polynomials should in any case be used [and in fact are], as
they have good bit-error checking properties).

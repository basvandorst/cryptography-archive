Is *that* all the problem?  Surely it can't take more than an afternoon
to write a dbm lookup routine to handle whats needed in a keyserver?

I would think the hardest thing to do would be to take the existing ring and
output each key in it individually.  After that the indexing should be
trivial.  Come on guys, don't be browbeated into submission!

PS Phil - how about getting ViaCrypt to sponsor key-servers on the net,
to support *their* product? :-)  No problems with licenses there I'd say...

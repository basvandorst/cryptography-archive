I am searching for source code for the LPC-10 compression algorithm
which compresses voice to 2400 baud.  Although the reproduced analog
voice signals are very poor using the LPC-10 algorithm we do have a
hard requirement to utilize a 2400 baud baseband channel for this
particular demonstration.  C source code would be preferred but any 
source code would suffice.  Are there other software options besides
the LPC-10 compression algorithm to generate a 2400 baud data stream??
Basically, we are interested in compressing a 64 kbps voice data stream
down to 2.4 kbps by implementing the LPC-10 compression algorithm on a
'C40 DSP.  

	I have been unable to locate the LPC-10 compression algorithms
anywhere on the Internet and would appreciate any guidance.  Feel free to 
email any suggestions you may have to the email address listed below.
Thank you in advance for your assistance.

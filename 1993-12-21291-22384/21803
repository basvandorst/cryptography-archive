So far as I remember it simply EORs the password with the file contents.
You could test your cryptanalysis skills by checking this, or anonymous
ftp to garbo.uwasa.fi and check these archives:
Directory /pc/crypt
wppass2.zip     A Wordperfect 5.x file encryptor/decryptor utility
                Also see /pc/ts/tsfcom24.zip for a crypter.exe
Directory /pc/ts
tsfcom24.zip    A set of programs for manipulating text files.

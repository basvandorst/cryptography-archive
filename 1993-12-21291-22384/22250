]     In the United States, it is unlawful to send encrypted messages over

]First Amendment to the United States Constitution?

Yes.  It's easily argued that regulation of the airwaves falls under the
"Commerce Clause."  The real question is:  should the FCC be allowed to get
away with crap like that?  The interstate highway system also falls under
federal jurisdiction.  Would politicians get away with micro-managing 
"amateur" traffic (i.e. non-18 wheelers) they way the FCC stomps on ham radio
and micro-power broadcasters?

Minorites are trod upon by our government.  What's new?

I don't agree that having the decrypted data "around" is always worse
than having the hashed passphrase around.  The hashed passphrase gives
the attacker a clue toward all your data on all your disks, while the
decrypted data is just from one disk.  If the hashed password is in
memory, then it is vulnerable to capture if the attacker gets hold of
the machine while the program is running.  There really doesn't seem
to be any reason to use anything having to do with the passphrase for
this purpose.  The IV could be xor'd with the encrypted random key or
a hash of it, for example.

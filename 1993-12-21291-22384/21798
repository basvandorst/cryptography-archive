Anyone familiar with RF measurements will know where to get solid state
noise sources; about 14 years ago I purchased one that was calibrated
for noise in the 2-4 gHz band for some satellite TV LNA's I was building.
(I was one of the origional backyard hackers in that area, at a time when
GaAs fets were about $150 or more each.)

Noise diodes are just diodes biased to zener breakdown (or some other
physical noise source, such as shot noise, etc) and calibrated for a given
noise density in the band of interest.  the difficulty is mainly to ensure
that you get a flat spectral distribution over the band you want, and to have
a stable and calibrated noise density so that meaningful noise figure
measurements can be made.

If you wish to get a flat noise distribution at low frequencies near DC,
it is best to hetrodyne noise from some higher band down and
low pass filter it to avoid 1/f noise components that all physical
noise sources have to some degree or another.

However, it is difficult to obtain true, very high accuracy, white
noise from any of these sources because some correlation always exists.

They are not "cryptographically strong".

It would be possible to use many such sources, each generating one or several
bits or so, to get some high quality random numbers, but great care would
have to be exercised in the analog circuitry to minimize correlation
between the bits.  But it could be done.

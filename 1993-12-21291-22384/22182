Both can be done with PGP.

Multiple recipients: directly supported.

Multiple senders: each sender "signs" the document and passes the signed 
copy to the next sender in encrypted form. The last sender encrypts to 
send to the recipient(s). All possible with PGP. The recipient, when 
decrypting, gets a list of verified signatories.

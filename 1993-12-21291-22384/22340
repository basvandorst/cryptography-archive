   I'm new to this group, and (if this is covered there) haven't seen
   the definition of MD5 which is referred to in some threads.  A simple
   definition once would be appreciated.  

It's in the FAQ, which is posted about monthly and also available in
the usual places, such as rtfm.mit.edu .  It's also in the rsa.com faq.

MD5 is Rivest's Message Digest 5 hashing algorithm, which takes
in arbitrarily large amounts of input (in chunks of 512 bits), and
produces a 128-bit hash output.  The intent of the algorithm is to be
cryptographically strong - there's no known method better than
brute-force for finding an input string with a given hash value
(2**128 is too much brute-force for anybody), or two input strings
with identical hash values (2**64 is currently too much for anybody,
and needs 2**64 pieces of storage as well, which should exceed
technological limits for quite a few decades.)  Changing any bit in
the input should change about half the bits in the output, pseudo-randomly.

There are a couple of exceptions which can be found by detailed
examination of the  algorithm, giving some special pairs of strings
which hash to the same values, but they're not going to occur at random.

This sounds like a somewhat erroneous explantion to me. For typical power
supplies, such as inside a laser printer, the diodes are conducting
only a small fraction of the time, say 10% of the cycle at a 120hz rate.
Outside of this interval, the line is isolated from the load. More likely
the spooks were detecting stray radiation coupled into the line from the
laser driver, not directly reading power consumption variations.

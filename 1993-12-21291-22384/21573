In the proceedings of CRYPTO 'XY or EUROCRYPT 'XY someone suggested to use
a "flood cipher". Both Alice and Bob could listen to (the same) source S of
random noise. S does produce a stream of random bits with high speed. The 
enemy (let's call her Evil Eve) could listen to S too. The secret key was 
an agreement on what bits of S shold be used (lets say the next 2^(20) bits
S does produce from Nov. 30 1993 at 21.50 o'clock and 10 seconds and 177 
milliseconds). Later Alice and Bob can use these bits like a one-time-pad.

Alice and Bob only have to store those bits of the random source they in
advance have agreed on.

But if Eve wants to decrypt what Alice and Bob do send, she has to store
much more random bits (maybee all random bits S does produce on Nov. 30 1993).
Since S does produce random bits that fast, Eve does not have the memory
to store those random bits. Eve is overflooded.

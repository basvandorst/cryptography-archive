It's well known that proving general theorems is NP. That roughly
implies that the length of time is exponential in the size of the
smallest proof.

Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last theorem is 200 pages - apparently 'fully
written out' it would be 1000 pages. If there are 50 steps per page,
and (suppose) the steps can be made in any order, then we're talking
about n^100000/(100000!), where n is the candidate set of steps,
presumably much larger than n. This is at least 2^100000.

So, there's a good argument that finding the proof by ATP means would
be equivalent to enumerating 100000 digit numbers.

Yet, someone solved it.

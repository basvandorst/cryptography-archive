Perhaps, but I question that's "how things really work".  First of all, I
suspect that the government doesn't really "fear" a crypto system developed
by a single individual in secret.  That would eliminate any opportunity for
peer review to spot weaknesses in the system.  Getting people worldwide to
use a flawed system might be just what they'd WANT!

Second, it presupposes no profit motive.  Using the method you've described,
there would be no way for you to be compensated for your efforts.  Selling
it would require you to provide ongoing product support, enhancements, etc.
which would pierce your de facto cloak of immunity.

Third, did I understand you correctly in hypothesizing the development of a
SECURE crypto system, presumably more secure than anything currently
available, in A SINGLE EVENING of work?  And if it's not more secure, why
bother?

Fourth, you don't think like a true conspiracy theorist. <g>  If you did
develop this system and disseminate it before they could stop you, don't you
think they'd be concerned about FUTURE efforts from you in this area?
"Concerned" enough to attempt to discourage further efforts and/or recruit
you to work FOR THEM?

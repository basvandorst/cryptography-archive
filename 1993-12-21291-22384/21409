     I've spoken with Keith Boyle, of Technosys, which is in Indianapolis,
Indiana.  I also spoke to Sue Sheain, who is an attorney in the Office
of the General Counsel at National Security Agency headquarters.  Boyle
says that he did receive such a letter and the products are real.
His is a tiny company (3 people) and he wasn't sure how to proceed.

     Sheain (whom I met at the CFP I conference) did not think NSA
had originated the letter.  I put Boyle in touch with Shean.  After
they talked, it appears that the letter didn't come from NSA or from
anybody at NSA.  The name on the letter wasn't that of an NSA employee.
The letter did appear to be on Justice Department stationery, while claiming
to be from NSA, or so Boyle tells me.

     In any case, Sheain assured Boyle that NSA had no interest in 
suppressing his product.

     Unclear where the letter came from.  I suspect somebody is trying
a hoax.  Boyle's technology is only marginally related to cryptography;
it's a word processor with a "paraphrase" option.

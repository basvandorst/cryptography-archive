PGP will do what you describe in the first paragraph -- you must
specify the multiple users, and the program will encode your message
with each recipient's respective public key.  

I don't believe it has group aliasing as you describe in the second
paragraph.  Note, however, that several passphrases are not needed for
PGP.  You remember your own, with which you "sign" the message to
allow authentication by the recipients.  Public keys do not have
require passphrases.

Have a panic password stored encrypted on the remote system.  Using this
password immediately invalidates *all* password sheets.  You needn't
worry about the panic password being seen by eavesdroppers because it
wouldn't let you log in; and you could simply memorize it to remove the
danger of theft.  While this wouldn't let you use your account, it would
lock out the thief as well.

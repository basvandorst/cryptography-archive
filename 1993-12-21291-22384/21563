The security of PGP can be easily compromised by distributing a bogus
version. It can be done in several ways and the one listed by you is
just one of them.

By using an old and trusted version of PGP to check the detached
signatures of each new version that appears.

No, that's not enough, unless you are willing to carefully examine and
understand each line of the source code in each new version. A better
solution is to always check whether each new version is signed by one
of the developers. Their public keys are widely available, so a spoof
is unlikely. The most serious danger is user ignorance. Most users get
PGP and never bother to check the detached signatures. Or use the new
version for that. Or when they see a signed message, they never
bother to check the signature. And so on.

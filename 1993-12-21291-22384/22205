Forgive me if my logic is slacking but I am a virgin to the crypt group and
    to this area in general.  I need to encrypt password type of data into 
    acsii data (i.e. not binary).  I wrote some code to do a encryption I 
    designed.  If I run this on a fairly large text file and then use 
    something like to pkzip to compress the encrpted file, can this be 
    compared to the non encrpted compressed file to determine anything 
    about the quality of the encryption.  I think I read somewhere that 
    any good encryption removes any patterns there by making compression 
    useless.....


Any comments, besides flames will be appreciated.

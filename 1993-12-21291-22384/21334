	I got my copy from Border's Books and Records in Dallas Texas
	thru special order in about a week.  By the way Bruce, it is
	excellent.  I just can't gush enough, you are to be congratulated
	for not only a good book, but also for helping the cause of freedom
	from government inteference in the lives of citizens.
	Thank you very much.

IMHO, this gives the NSA too much Machiavellian credit.  They probably 
wish they were so effective.

I see the NSA as a gigantic bureaucracy, the best funded and largest in 
the world I think when you consider all military personnel who actually 
work for them.  I'll bet you that the NSA screws up half a dozen times 
per week.

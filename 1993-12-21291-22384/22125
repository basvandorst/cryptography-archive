In general, it tends to make breaking the ciphertext more difficult by
producing less cipher text to cryptoanalyze, as well as reducing
redundancies in the plaintext that could make a plaintext attack easier.

However!!!  ... it might actually make the job easier, if improperly done.
For example, if you used an encryption package that produces an initial
"signature" (to later identify the file as compressed), and you encrypt it
with a weak crypto implementation, like ECB, that combination might make a
plaintext attack on the first block much easier.  Also, some compression
programs tend to produce a lot of trailing nulls in the compressed archive
for some reason.  I've noticed that when I've uuencoded PKZIPped files, for
example.

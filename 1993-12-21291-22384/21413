I'm very skeptical, and enumerated several reasons in an earlier article.
(Skeptical about the story, not so skeptical about the existence of
the company).

Curious.  To me "natural language encryption" suggested that the
encryption technique was to pull out the structure of a sentence
(e.g., into an X-bar schema) and then encrypt the structure
separately.

For instance, you would not encode the ASCII string:

   Attack Seattle at midnight

But instead the schema

	 / Seattle (noun 14882)
    /
   +
	\                    / at midnight (0)
	 \ Attack (verb 181)/

and the ciphertext could be something like 41-181-0-14882, where the
first number is a code for the schema.  A large part of the cipher
would be knowing that "181" was an encoded verb, not an encoded
noun, adjective, etc.

A word processor with a real "paraphrase" capability would have extensive
natural language capabilities, but how this would expose encryption
techniques is beyond me - unless they were hoping to hide the intersection
of cryptology and AI/NLP.

      You can encrypt in the unlicenced spread-spectrum business bands.
So far, these seem to be used mostly for waiter-to-kitchen links and
wireless LANs, but Tetherless Access is trying to link schools and
libraries this way.

      I'm waiting for someone to invent legal digital pirate radio 
broadcasting.  You'd have to sell custom receivers, but if you made 
every non-portable receiver a relay station, you could cover a city.
There's a power limit, but it is per-transmitter; you can set up as
big a net as you want.  So you could have broadcasting free of licence
and content restrictions.  Check out the regs.

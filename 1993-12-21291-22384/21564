PGP comes in C source, which can be compiled on a variety of
platforms, including many brands of Unixes. Just get it, read the
docs, and compile it.

As secure as your account is from the other users of the system. Now
stop for a while and think a bit - how secure is your account from the
superuser?

Yes, it is. If somebody gets your secret keyring, they won't be able
to extract the secret key without figuring out what the passphrase is.
However, on a multi-user system, usually the superuser (or its
equivalent) is able to monitor any user's keystrokes. That is, they
can snatch your passphrase as you are entering it. The same can be
done by anybody else who can break into your account.

I think your logic is that if I can't guess one key, then I the
fact that the cycle is periodic doesn't help me.

But, suppose everyone started using that RNG, and I discovered that
after a few million cycles, it would start outputting 3,8,27,3,8,27,...

It still wouldn't be hard to guess someones next key - there's only 3
possibilities.

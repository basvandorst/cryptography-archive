[mention of specific units omitted].

Uniden also has a spread spectrum unit, currently being sold by Sharper
Image but probably more widely available soon. Since it is an import, they
don't (as I understand such things) need to satisfy the NSA, and thus there
is a possibility it might be more secure than domestic units designed to be
exportable.

Yes, but you could be a spawn of the CIA...lying to use to gull us into 
using the "new improved" version of PGP.  :-)  Aren't there more ways
to achieve the same effect?  (Don't really know enough of the specifics
to tell!)

Honestly, I was waiting for someone to say they've checked it out.  That's
why the source is distributed after all.  But we can't go dampening rumors
like this here!  So you must be a NSA plant.  The foreign address is simply
a clever ruse to make us think you don't work for the NSA.  Or, maybe you
work for a more sinister agency...say B'Harrne or something.

The real question is how long (after crippling PGP) would it take to
detect it?  And, would the people who you really want to fool use the
new version before it's checked out?  I assume there's some newsgroup
to check this out as well.  I know there are people out there checking
on PGP (and trying to figure ways to better it, and to crack it).

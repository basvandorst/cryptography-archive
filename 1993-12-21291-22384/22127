Alex, the company's name is Access Data (out of California).  They have 
an entire slew of programs for cracking things like PKZip, MS Word, MS Excel,
WordPerfect (including 6.0!), and more.  They can even recover the password
for Novel Network supervisors!!!  They have a total of 5 disks at $185 each.
One disk will open 2 or 3 program's encrypted files.  This company and it's
phone number was posted here a few messages ago (within the last 2 weeks)
and it might also be in the FAQ.  I received a working demo from them, but
they say it only works on 10 character passwords (else everyone would only
want the demo!).  I have not played with it yet.

The cost of the Novel Network supervisor password recovery program is a
bit higher - like $395 for the disk!!!  They do have packages and quantity
discounts, though.  It all depends on how much your encrypted data is
worth to you (would it cost more than $185 to reconstruct your data once, 
or more than $93 twice, ...).

BTW, this company GUARANTEES that their program(s) can crack the passwords.
If their program fails, send in the file and they will do it on their
in-house systems.  They told me that they currently have NO known problems
and that all programs will break passwords of the specified product and its
previous revisions (ie: WordPerfect 6.0 AND 5.2, 5.1, 5.0, ....).

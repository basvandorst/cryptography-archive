Dunno about RIPEM and PEM (don't have them handy and cannot check
right now), but PGP does have such a capability - since version 2.2, I
believe.

No.

Yes.

PGP does it by encrypting the message with a single, randomly
generated key for a symmetric cypher (IDEA in this case). This key is
itself encrypted afterwards with the public keys of each of the
recepients of the group. The result of each of those encryptions forms
a special packet and ALL the packets are provided with the message.
When a member of the group receives the message, s/he attempts to
decrypt with his/her secret key each of the packets. In one of the
cases the decryption will be successful. It will reveal the IDEA key,
which can be used to decrypt the message itself.

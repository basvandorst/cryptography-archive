A French publisher has bought the rights to a French-language edition of
Applied Cryptography.  They want to bundle a source-code disk with the book,
but (of course) I cannot supply it.  I am sure there is someone outside the
U.S. who can.

What the French publisher is looking for is someone to put together a source
code disk to go with the book.  This person has to beyond the reach of U.S.
laws.  I don't know if the publisher is willing to pay for this; I am not
involved in any of this.

If you may be interested, please e-mail me.  I will forward all the e-mails
I get to the French publisher, and then you and he will negotiate directly.
I don't know the details, and I don't want to.

Any takers?

Bruce

What beast is this randomness thing? I've been kicking around
one time pad ideas for a while now. Recently I decided that there
were 2 kinds of predictability, local and global.

The series 111111 is globally predictable because the probability
function is not flat.

The series 123...7890123...7890123... has a flat prob. density function
but it's locally predictable using the simple succession function
s(n) = (n+1) mod 10.

Now we get into subjectivity by thinking of that function as 'simple'.
Why is it simpler than any other function? My successor function
could be a polynomial of any order. I could include discontinuities as
well. With such complications I no longer understand an objective
definition for randomness. It seems to me that global randomness is
objective, but local randomness is totally subjective, depending only on
what style of functions you are accustomed to dealing with.

It would seem to me that a successor function that was culturally odd
enough would survive plaintext attack.

These ideas seem to me at odds with all I've heard of modern crypto.
Am I making mistakes in my thinking? Why not just tamper with
bizarroid polynomials with funny rules thrown in, rather than all these
shift registers and prime numbers?

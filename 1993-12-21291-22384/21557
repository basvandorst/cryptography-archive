Quick question:
If the last block of plaintext being fed to a block cipher encrpytion
routine is not filled, what is the normal approach?
- Pad with all zero or all one bits?
- Always pad with a one bit, then zero bits (like many hash functions)?
(These first two don't seem particularly secure to me.)
- Pad with random garbage?
- If the latter, is it secure to use bits from the key/subkey-block?

Indeed.

Indeed violence on television affects the minds of youngsters, I was just 
looking at an old Calvin & Hobbes strip: Calvin is telling Hobbes how he 
read another article whining about violence on TV, when Hobbes asks him 
if he thinks all the shoot outs, car wrecks, fist fights and grizzly 
murders he likes to watch are affecting his mind he replies "Nahh. I'd 
like to shoot the idiots who thinks this stuff affects me." :-)

Ever forward,

David

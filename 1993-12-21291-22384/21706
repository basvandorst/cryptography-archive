OK, you're right. Good point.  If I were in the business of creating
such things for serious use, I would probably make something available
to the public just to spread good technology and share the wealth
as it were.  For that I also commend Phil Zimmerman.  What I mean
is that I would make sure that the one that *I* depend on is truly
secure and take real practical security measures to that end.

That's true.  Given that it is software... ye' old bug or two
might just be lurking to bite us.

Yeah, I'm familiar with those earlier problems too.  As with everything,
it gets better (or comes to maturity with age) aka Windows 1.0-3.1

I don't know if that was a concession or not, but I do see your point.

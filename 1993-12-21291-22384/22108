Others have pointed out the well-known "small modulus" flaw in RSA.  Of
course, PGP pads the IDEA key with *different* random padding  for each
recipient, so the "message" as far as RSA is concerned, is totally
different and the attack doesn't apply.  (And thus even though PGP uses
e=17 by default, sending a message to >= 17 recipients does not reveal
the message.)

This is another example of why using RSA directly as a cipher is not
a very bright idea.  Its public-keyness is wonderful.  But there are
all these gotchas in using it that simply don't exist with conventional
encryption.

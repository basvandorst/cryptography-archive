I've got a question.  I've read how PGP and RIPEM support sending a
message to multiple users->multiple keys.

I assume that this means encoding the message n times, once for each
recipient.  So therefore, if you don't have this scheme integrated
with your mailer, you have to send out a message that's n times longer
than it would be for one recipient, no?

(I mean, a smart mailer would be able to encrypt the message based
upon all your To: values seperately).

What if, to cast all doubt aside about 'smart mailers,' I wanted to
encrypt a file in my (public?) directory, so that (a b c d e) could
read it.

It seems that I'd have to make five copies of the file, each encoded
with a, b, c, d, or e's code.

Ok, so now we know what I'm talking about.

Is there any mathematical way to overcome this, within the "standard"
public key methodology?

Here's an explanation of my terms:

|take plaintext  ---> f(x) ---> ciphertext ---> f(x) ---> plaintext
|and secret key --'             and public -'
|
|    OR
|
|take plaintext  ---> f(x) ---> ciphertext ---> f(x) ---> plaintext
|and public key --'             and secret -'

is an asymmetric key system.

I want

take plaintext    ---> f(x) --->   ciphertext    ---> f(x) ---> plaintext
keys a, b, c, d, e -'     any of a, b, c, d, or e -'


In other words, encrypt it so any of five keys can unlock it.

Possible?  Exists?

Thanks,

Mike

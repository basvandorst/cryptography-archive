There are other differences as well. In short, CRC is designed to
detect random errors, while the MDx algorithms are designed to detect
malicious intentional forgery of the message.

MD5 has a constant number of bits - 128.

In the same directory you can find implementations of MD4, SHS, and
Dan Bernstein's fingerprint. I plan to add MD2 one of those days.

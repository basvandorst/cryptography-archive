I have been rfeading a description of a prtocol that uses a one way function
for bit commitment and need some help understanding it. The protocol is
roughly as follows:
1)Alice generates two random bit strings r1 and r2.
2)Alice creates a message consisting of the random bit strings and the bit she
wishes to commit to (or several bits)------ (r1,r2,b)
3)Alice hashes the message and sends the result to bob as well as one of
the randome strings, say r1.
When it comes time to reveal her bit
4)Alice sends bob the orginal message (r1,r2,b)
5)Bob hashes the message and compares it and r1 with hash and r1 he received in
step 3.
I do not understand why alice must send one of the random strings as well as
the hash. Why is not comparing the hashes absolute confirmation? Why not work
the whole protocol with just one random string and the bit, b?
thanks from a beginner

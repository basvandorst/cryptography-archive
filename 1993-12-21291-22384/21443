Thanks a lot for posting that up.

Is there any chance of anyone dreaming up some good substitution blocks to
put in as K?  Or, better, does anyone actually have some secure substitution
blocks already?  I'm working on building a library of block ciphers in ARM
code, and this looks like a good one to add to it.  It's just that it's not
an awful lot of use without decent tables.

1) remember, dictionary searches against stored hashed passwords have
been around for a long time.  Network sniffers are newer and arguably
more difficult.  I believe the fastest Unix DES implementation, for
a while, was one written in Microvax assembly language specifically
for the purpose of breaking passwords, so don't think crackers are
unsophisticated.  It only takes one cracker to write such a program
and circulate it on a cracker BBS.

2) It seems to me that ordinary passwords also provide adequate
security for many purposes, or else they wouldn't be used.  So in
situations where passwords aren't good enough, I don't see any point
in security enhancements that are only slight improvements (if they
are improvements at all).  If you can make a custom crypto calculator
cheaply (embedded microcontroller, keypad, LCD display) then that
is probably the best bet.  Note that those $3 solar powered K-mart
calculators rarely provide scientific functions, by the way.

3) This scheme also seems to have the blemish that the secret PIN must
be stored on the remote host, unlike other methods which store only
passwords etc. only in hashed form.

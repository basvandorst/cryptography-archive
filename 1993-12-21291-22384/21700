 First off, the phrase is:

 "Danger! Will Robinson, DANGER!" this line is credited to the robot of 
    'Lost in Space' but the robot WASN'T named Twiki! In fact the robot
     NEVER had a name. He was ONCE called 'Hero' in an early episode, the
     Heath Co. then introduced a kit robot bearing the same name. Irwin
     Allen Productions claimed "It's not our robot!".

  There never was a Vicki Robinson...at least in Lost in Space.

  And the "Twiki" character was from "Buck Rogers"!

  ...I notice you're attending a Law University...I somehow doubt I'd be
 very interested in having an attorney that's as scrambled upstairs as
 you seem to be!

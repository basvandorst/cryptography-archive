Ralph Finch merely asked a question.  I answered it, interpreting the
phrase "private key" to mean the UNENCRYPTED private key, not
the encrypted file.  He said in a later post that he was asking about
the contents of the file, not about the actual key.  Obviously if you know
the actual private key (which exists somewhere in RAM during execution
of PGP), then you can decrypt all messages encrypted with the public key.
Knowing what pass phrase was used to encrypt the private key is irrelevant
once the phrase has been used to obtain the key.

If the private key was generated on a shared system, then someone could
have been snooping on the PGP process while it generated the key and
captured it prior to encryption with the passphrase.

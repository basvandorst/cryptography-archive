Everything you said made sense.  There's one even bigger problem however.
Once someone purchases one of the products, and gets the code, all he or she
would have to do is pass that code around.  Unlike "normal" piracy which
involves doing disk copying, here the person who wants the program just
orders the "free" CD and unlocks what he or she needs.  Without some way of
making te codes local for each CD, there's simply no protection.  I know this
has nothing to do with cracking the encryption, but it's just as much of an
issue.  Encryption is useless once someone knows the password.

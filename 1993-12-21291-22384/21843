     It's a bit more substantial than that.  In the 1950's the British
     (MI6) and the US (CIA) ran a pair of operations called SILVER
     and GOLD in which they tunelled into the Soviet telephone
     lines in Vienna and Berlin and started listening in.  Even 
     though the Soviets were encrypting their teletype communications,
     enough of the unencrypted signal was leaking through to be
     readable.
     
     The operations first saw life when a certain Carl Nelson
     demonstrated that you could do the same with a US machine
     called Sigtot.  He could pick up plaintext echoes up to twenty
     miles away.

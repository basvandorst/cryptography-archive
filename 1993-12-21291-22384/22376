I think you want the Cryptanalyst's Work Bench (CWB) by Bob Baldwin.  
It's available on the net somehow, but I don't know how.

This is a guess, mind you, but it sounds like elm is using unix's 
crypt(), a single rotor Enigma with 256 characters (instead of 26).  The 
"rotor" is randomly seeded.

Basically, you look for "isologs", identical phrases encrypted in 
different places in the message.  You can spot the isologs by looking for 
repeated patterns in the ciphertext where the letters *are not the same* 
but the patterns of repeating letters are identical.

Finding two isologs, you now know the distance between the characters on 
the "rotor".  In other words, you have part of the key.  This will help 
you find more plaintext, and these in turn will give you more key.  And 
so on.  It's really lots of fun.

NO! NO! NO! JEEZUZ! Don't you kids have anything like short-term memory??

Robbie the Robot was specifically constructed for the feature film 
'Forbidden Planet'...thereafter the prop was often modified and seen 
in and around the CBS TV lot, and appeared in several episodes of the
'Twilight Zone' as well as 3 other motion pictures. Robbie was recently
sold at auction for $15,000.00 and became an artifact in a private home
collection of Hollywood trinkets owned by Quinn Martin Jr!

The robot on 'Lost in Space' was NOT, repeat, NOT the same one! Go visit
a Sci-Fi Con or two or three! The 'Lost in Space' robot is currently on
tour with the original propman from the series, at most of the recent
CONs and the Sci-Fi Channel recently did a piece on this in their weekend
"Sci-Fi Buzz" segment.


Beni Santus Spiritus...do da! do da!

Sort of.

In general, if you're in a position to encrypt your traffic, then 
you don't need S/Key's paper list -- you can 
use something like kerberos, and, as I recall S/Key has a mode
meant for exactly this situation in which a shared secret is used for
login authentication -- your local machine uses the secret to 
generate what would have been carried on a piece of paper. 

That's pretty clever, though, the use of the next key as the shared
secret!

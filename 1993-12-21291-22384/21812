If Tempest shielding were as simple as you say, anyone could
(and would) manufacture Tempest hardware.

There are two fundamentally different approaches to Tempest
shielding:

1. Take any piece of equipment and put it in a _heavily_ shielded
enclosure. (This is the old method, and was abandoned because of
the impractical size and weight of the resulting equipment.)

2. Carefully design the equipment from the start so that it has
low electromagnetic emanations. (This is very hard in practice.)

Modern Tempest equipment use a combination of these two approaches;
you design it to have the lowest emanations possible, and then
use light shielding to further improve on that.

And keep in mind that while CRTs are the worst offenders in
terms of Tempest, they are by no means the only ones.

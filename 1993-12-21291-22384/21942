I am trying to decypher a code. It is "GSCWTCGBVDECVUCUE"
I would love for someone to help me. Here is all the info I have:
   A simple encryption system where a phrase was encrypted by shifting 
each letter by a fixed amount. For instance "PINK" encrypted with the 
key "HOG" becomes "XXUS" "H" is the 8th letter in the alphabet. "P" 
shifted 8 letters is "X". "O" is the 15th letter. "I" shifted 15 
characters is "X"
The encrypted message above is from Arab extremists that (foolishly) 
encoded with this system. They used a 3-letter key. Incidentally, the 
message involves Anwar Sadat. Perhaps his name appears in the message.
The message is in English.
Thank you for your help.

Hello

I am trying to get cbw to work, and, well, it's not compiling right somewhere.
My platform is an HP 9000/715, and I'm using HP-UX 9.01, with it's ANSI cc.
It compiles fine (more-or-less -- I have to add a bsd terminal structure, and
include the sys/bsdtty.h file), but it dumps the core whenever it reaches the
terminal initialization phase.

on a BSDish machine (like the hpApollo DN 3500), it does not properly set
the terminal, and there are weird characters all over the place.

help?

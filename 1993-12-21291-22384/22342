Actually, it's not even that hard.  If you wanted to produce a hosed
binary version, say for ftp distribution on dockmaster.ncsc.mil :-),
you just abuse the "random number" generator, and leak the private key
out in parts in initialization vectors.  If you want to be really blatant, 
you can ship 64 bit chunks of the key out at a time, and restrict the
session keys to some small set of values (2**16 should be small enough
to be nearly undetectable, especially if you've encoded them so they
look "random" rather than being 0000...1 0000...2 etc.).  If you want
to get fancy, you can also encode the bits you hide in the IV.
Use the session key to indicate which values are hidden in the IV.
So a 1024-bit key could leak in 16 messages if they're in sequence.

Why do I still trust ViaCrypt?  Well, Phil Z. was at the November
cypherpunks meeting, and has said that it's legitimate code.
Id rather have source, of course, but it's a good start,
assuming Phil isn't really one of the NSA's Tentacles :-)

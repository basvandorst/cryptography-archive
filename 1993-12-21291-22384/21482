How come ntpv3 got released then? dummy encrypt module worked there...

then do what bones did, send code out completely stripped of calls to 
des encode/decode and let us *TRY* to put them back. It worked for eBones
so it would probably work for this.

Ok, so its not as simple as stub calls. Its still not impossible to
get round.

or, as Graham Toal suggested, generalize the model to performing CRC
checks or other hash/checksum on block contents, and we can stuff
'related' functions in to perform what is the original design goal.

Better yet, somebody outside the USA could write a complete one.

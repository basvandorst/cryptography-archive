I would like to know what you others out there think is a 
reasonable scenario for the future - the 20-50 years ahead, say.

* What kind of protocols will be needed and by whom?

* Will the field enjoy the same kind of boom as the general
  computer industry did 10-15 years ago? (I doubt it)

* In what areas will there be applications?

Certainly, military and financial institutions will encipher and sign
their communication, and computer users will have to use passwords
to gain access to their accounts. But will we have digital cash, 
for example, on a large scale? How about digital passports?

I would like to hear what you think reasonable applications would be,
and what areas in cryptography will not only be of intellectual interest.

My main reason for wanting to know is that I feel that, being 
a third on my way through my PhD studies, I need some guidance.
I do not intend to stay within academia, but on the other hand,
I definetly do not want to be a programmer implementing 
cryptographic algorithms. I would like to find a niche in business
where protocol developing skills are needed. Who would need me
and for what? 

I hope that you have time to write down what you think the future 
will bear, I am looking forward to reading your thoughts on this. 

Either post or email to markus@cs.ucsd.edu

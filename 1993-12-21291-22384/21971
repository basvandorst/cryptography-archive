It might be worthwhile to look at

   Ronald L. Rivest, "Finding Four Million Large Random
   Primes," CRYPTO 90 proceedings, p. 625.

Rivest's method was

   1. Try the small divisor test (divide by all primes
      between 2 and 10000)

   2. Test for pseudoprime  (does 2^(n-1) == n  mod n?)

   3. Apply an appropriate number of iterations of
      the Miller-Rabin probabilistic test


The paper is chock full of the low level details
of how it was actually done.  It's worth reading.

By the way, he proposes another, more controversial
method for doing primality testing REALLY FAST.
The reason for the work, incidentally, was to try out
this other, faster-but-controversial, method.  In
this experiment, the new test worked flawlessly.

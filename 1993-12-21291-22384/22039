Has anyone else noticed the consistencies in Euler's totient function with
respect to the powers of two?

Though they don't always hold for small values (i.e.: 2,3,4), in general:

	totient(2^i) == 2^(i-1)

	totient(2^i + 2^(i-1)) == 2^(i-1)

I've seen similar patterns in higher powers as well, and where some smaller
power is *subtracted* from a higher power too.  Since *all* numbers can be
expressed as a sum of powers of two, is there some way to use this pattern
(if there really is one) to quickly calculate Euler's totient function?

It's really frustrating!  The pattern seems so obvious, yet I can't get it
generalized enough to apply to all sums of powers of two.   ARGH!

As an aside...

Would having a quick way of computing this function be of any real *use*?

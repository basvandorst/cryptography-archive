What, no prizes? And we don't get to see the code? That probably means
nobody is going to bother trying to break your data. Even if you badly
implemented DES, it would be difficult to break without the algorithm.
Best way to verify your DES is to get someone else's (ripem.msu.edu has
lots of them if you're U.S., foreign sites do if you're not) and compare
results for the same data and key. That's how I checked an IDEA
implementation. If you get different results, happy debugging, because
almost any bug will cause randomly differing output.

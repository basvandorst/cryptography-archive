When I went to Europe a few months ago, nobody could have cared
less what I took out of the US of A. When I came back, customs
took everything out of my duffle bag and examined each and every
item. The didn't give my laptop more than a cursory first look
("Would you turn this on, please?"), but they were *very*
fascinated with the stack of cryptology books and magazines I
was bringing back *into* the US. Very interested indeed. The guy
took the stack back into a room where I couldn't see and didn't
come out for about five minutes. Lord only knows what they were
doing with my books or why they cared.

Overall, I got a kick out of it.

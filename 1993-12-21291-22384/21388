Hello,

in a paper from Odlyzko[1] the author mentioned the Chor-Rivest Knapsack.
I did not yet get the original paper [2], but I would like to know

	- What is the present status of the Chor-Rivest Knapsack?
	  (Has it been broken?)

	- Is the Chor-Rivest Knapsack used for other cryptographic primitives
	  apart from encryption (zero-knowledge proofs, secure random number
	  generators, ...)?

Thank you

  Stefan

This sounds quite easy to cryptanalyze by capturing a couple of
sessions and exhaustively searching through the space of PIN's and
functions that could have created that particular challenge/response
pair.  Since all the functions you mention are mathematically well
behaved (differentiable in most places etc.), the cracker might be even
able to partially solve the equations using standard numerical methods
without needing to do exhaustive search.  And you've required the
user to memorize this funny function sequence in addition to the PIN.
This seems to me to be too much stuff to memorize.

Well you don't really need a custom cryptocalculator to get high security.
Just program a pocket organizer (Sharp Wizard or whatever) or even a
cheap programmable calculator with a tough-to-invert crypto function.

It seems less convenient to me.  I can put a small piece of paper in
my wallet and forget about it til I need it.  But I rarely carry a
calculator, even a cheap solar powered one, and don't want to have to
start carrying one.

>Human factors might make it more resistant to sharing passwords too....

I guess from a security admin's perspective, this is an advantage.
But as a user I heretically prefer the flexibility of being able to
share passwords when I choose to.

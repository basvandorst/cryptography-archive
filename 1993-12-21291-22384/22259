The NSA has no need to break PGP since they can read your mind using Z-rays.
You don't think all those antennas are REALLY for TV stations, do you?

Now that I've exposed that, the NSA will probably switch to their
super-secret system using the dipole moments in very fine particles in the
air to read your thoughts before you've thunk them. It's not well known, but
some of the NSA's budget for this program comes from the Justice Department,
who sees it as a way to unclog the courts.

And by the way, you don't REALLY believe there's a Department of
Agriculture, do you? That building is the main R&D site for the NSA's
next-generation project for thinking our thoughts for us, and then sending
them to us via Berthold rays. That will REALLY simplify much of civic life,
giving us a decisive advantage over the Japanese.

Gotta go now--there are some men in white coats with a very large net
ringing my front doorbell.

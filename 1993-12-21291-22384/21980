  I have a encrypted zip archive that I have lost the password
  to. I remember someone once mentioned that zips encryption
  was trivial to break, and that there was a program that did it.
  If anyone knows the name of this program, or better yet, what
  ftp sight it might be on, can you please send me mail.


Thanks

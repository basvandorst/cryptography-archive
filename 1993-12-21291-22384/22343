   Probably an accurate valuation of the comment. There's no reason there
   should be a connection between the cost of a set of encryption/decryption
   hardware and the cost to break a system. You can probably get a pair of

Depends on how you plan to break the system.  Maybe the
spread-spectrum algorithm is really secure, but the random-number
generator always uses the same seed from a ROM - that would make it
trivial to break if you've got the plans and the seed.
Maybe they pick one of N ROMs out of a bag like the older cordless phones.
Maybe it's a PROM that's different for every phone, e.g. the serial number.
That makes it a bit more work, unless you can either black-bag in a new
PROM or read the serial number off the label on the phone some night.
Or maybe it uses something clock-dependent, which gives a little more
variation.  Only the manufacturer knows for sure, unless you can find
a sales person knowledgable enough to tell you.

Also, the last time I read the ITAR postings on the net, I'm pretty
sure they said you needed licenses to import crypto hardware,
though I don't currently have a copy on-line.  Software was ok, though.

Hi Folks/entrepreneurs

Is any of you aware of a standard for writing encryption API.
If one is looking at multiple hardware, software, smartcard
or encryption peripherals - does one have the option of refering
to a standard.  I am not looking for algorithm or how to?
keymanagement standard - rather an ability to incorporate
into my application programs the ability to use any crypto
product (atleast most).

Really appreciate your email, and, subject to interesting 
responses will post a summary on the sci.crypt.

Regards - Srini

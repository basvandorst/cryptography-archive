A few weeks back I posted to AFU a report from the local evening daily
(Wellington, NZ, that is) reporting a warning from Interpol that a request
for business cards for Craig Sherwood (sic) was _probably_ a scam and
_certainly_ past its "use by" date.  The implication was the business cards
were not for anything so benign as a mailing list.

So my answer to your question is a definite "maybe".

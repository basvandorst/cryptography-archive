I just came across an interesting article called `More on the Soviets and
Ultra' in a journal called `Intelligence and National Security' which we've
started to cover for `Computer and Communications Security Reviews'.

In this essay, which appeared in v 4 no 2 (April 89), the author (G Jukes)
reports (on the basis of Soviet officers' memoirs) that the Russians were
reading German naval enigma traffic by December 1943 at latest. On the army
side, Zhukov was getting good production intelligence by 8th April 1943.

Given that John Cairncross at Bletchley was working for the Russians, they
would have known how to build bombes. However they would have needed an
entry point into the traffic in order to guess plaintext for the bombes to
work on. The article suggests that this came from the large quantity of 
material captured at Stalingrad in late February 43.

Jukes also reports that the Russians (unlike Britain) indulged in constant 
electronic warfare - they started off simply jamming German traffic, and later 
used to replay messages with bad code groups in the middle. It occurred to me 
that this may explain why the Germans changed their keys more and more 
frequently towards the end of the war; this fact always seemed to be in 
conflict with the claim that none of them knew that Enigma was being read 
until Winterbotham's book came out in 1974.

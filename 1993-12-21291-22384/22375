Observe the word "target".  I believe it was in the Church Committee 
Hearings, mid-70s, that the NSA made no bones that "targets" could be US 
citizens at NSA discretion.  

Shortly after, columnist Jack Anderson wrote that the NSA had "targeted" 
former Attorney General Bell, under the excuse that Soviet agents had 
contacted him (details were not explained).

You gotta watch out for weasel words like "target" in government 
writing.  Look out for words that say so little but can mean so much.

Ah here is where you run into trouble. LIke those books which give
detailed directions on cooking but start out with " First you catch an
allegator". For any good crypto system, figuring out the key given the
encrypted text and the plain text is "impossible" (ie not likely to be
doable with any current resources).
Of course my comment is predicated on the hypothesis that they used a
good crypto system.

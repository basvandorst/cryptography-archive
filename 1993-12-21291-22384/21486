To be clear, a hash function is a mapping h from the set Z^* of all words on
the finite alphabet Z to Z. Thus, this function cannot be injective.

The theoretical definition of hash functions is much more complicated. It
requires a model in complexity theory. Here, we consider only practical hash
functions.

Now, there are several properties for security. For instance :
- Universal hash functions : roughly, for any word w, it is too difficult to
find an other word w' such that h(w) = h(w');
- One Way hash functions : for any hash value c, it is too difficult to find a
word w such that h(w) = c;
- Collision Free hash functions : it is too difficult to find two different
words w and w' such that h(w) = h(w').

The links between those properties are not well known. For surjective hash
functions, we may have CF ==> U ==> OW. Otherwise, we still have CF ==> U. So,
CF and OW are the most powerfull property for cryptographic hash functions.

Generally, a cryptographic hash function is considered to be unsecure when
someone found a collision (w and w'). Of course, we can argue this notion of
secure hash function.

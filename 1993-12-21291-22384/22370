Fair question.  Here's the answer:

  The security value of a cryptosystem is a function both of the resistance
to cryptographic attack AND the amount of information a legitimate user
of the information would need to possess SECRETLY to decode it [or worse,
would have to communicate secretly].  In most private-key systems today,
one must secretly possess and communicate 56-128 bits of information (a
small enough amount as to be commitable to memory).  In most public-key
systems, one must secretly possess about 1024 bits of secret information,
but one need not communicate it.  Note: 1024 bits is 128 bytes; 56-128
bits is 7-16 bytes.

  To use a system as you are describing would be that a program (pretty
large) be kept secret and communicated to the intended recipient of the
message.  While the program MAY be more secure than, e.g., IDEA, it
will probably be at least 1000 times as big as an IDEA key and it will
amnost certainly not be by any measure 1000 times as secure.

  A couple more gotchas: if an IDEA key is compromised, it is easy to
produce a new one and knowing the old one will tell a snooper nothing
about the new one.  RSA keys are a little harder to generated, but the
same general principle holds true for them.  Creating custom software,
if it's supposed to be any good, is MUCH harder, and creating new
custom software if the old was compromised would be dreadful indeed
(note that one would have to start over from scratch if one were to
avoid letting enemy knowledge of the old weaken the new).  Note also
that compression by itself is cryptographically very poor.  Even if
one were to use, e.g., dynamic huffman encoding with a passphrase-set
initialization tree, patterns would still be highly visible [they'd
change fairly frequently, but the changes would be easy to spot].
While there's no harm in compressing data before encrypting it, one
should not assume that compression does anything for cryptographic
strength.

I was curious as to whether any work has been done in the area of
group key management. Are there any facilities or features in Public
Key Encryption, PGP, RIPEM or the PEM specification to handle
multiple recipients or multiple senders?

I'm not completely familiar with how the public and private keys are
generated except to know that they come in pairs. Is there anything
inherent in the PKE algorithm which prevents some form of group
functionality? 

For example, suppose that I take a message and code it with a
recipient's public key. Now, I want this recepient to be a member of
a trusted group of people who can all read this mail message. Of course,
we still want this recipient to be able to receive personal mail which
only he can read. Thus, he still must have a private key and passphrase.
Can this be done?

One solution (so it seems) is to create a special key for that specific
group of trusted people and then encrypt that message with that special
key. Unforunately, the number of special keys then becomes a function of
the number of groups, and a person will have to remember several
passphrases. Bad.

Ideas anyone?

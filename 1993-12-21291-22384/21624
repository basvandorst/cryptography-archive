This is a followup to my earlier posting about KFS, an encrypting
filesystem for Sun computers running SunOS 4.1.x.  Please see my
earlier posting to sci.crypt and comp.sources.testers for additional
detail or send me email and I will send you the original announcement.

Thanks to Mark Riordan's generosity, KFS is now available for ftp from
ripem.msu.edu in the directory:

        /pub/crypt/other/kfs-0.1.3-crypto-filesystem.tar.gz.

For instructions on getting access, see the file included at the end of
this message.  If you don't have ftp capability, I will still send out
distributions of the source code to people on an individual basis if
you send me a message indicating the following:

+  That you are a citizen of the United States or Canada or a permanent
   resident of one of the above two countries and entitled under the law
   to use cryptographic software.

+  That you will not redistribute the source code to anyone that does
   not meet the above requirement and will take reasonable steps to
   insure that unauthorized users do not gain access to the software.

+  Your full name and email address.

Provided that your request originates from a machine in the U.S. or
Canada, I will send you a uuencoded compressed tar archive of the
current version of kfs (currently patchlevel 3).

Remember, KFS is an alpha-quality product.  Although it has been
working reliably for myself and a few other people for a little
while now, I make no warranties as to its reliability or suitability
for any particular application.  I am making the code available at
this time primarily because I would like to other people to test
the code and let me know about any bugs they find and because I
hope to attract other programmers who might be interested in develop-
ing KFS into a more polished product.  KFS is free software and is
provided under the terms of the Gnu Public License (GPL).

I have set up a mailing list for discussion among testers and develop-
ers of KFS and as a means of distributing patches to people interested
in staying up to date with the latest version of the source code.  If
you would like to be added to the list, send mail to kfs-dev-request@
lila.com with the keyword 'subscribe' in the body of the message.  You
will then receive mail with instructions on how to post to the list
and how to be removed from it if you decide you no longer wish to
receive it.

Instructions for getting ftp access to ripem.msu.edu:

Dear FTP user,

To access the RIPEM cryptographic software archive at ripem.msu.edu,
you must have an "account" on my custom FTP server.  Traditional
anonymous FTP login is allowed, but anonymous users are prevented
from doing GETs on files containing cryptographic software.
Anonymous access is allowed so that you can get README-type files
like this one, and files containing descriptions of software
licensing terms.

This FTP server is not an official service at all.  Although 
accounts have no specific expiration dates, your account (or 
more likely, the service as a whole) could be discontinued at
any time without any advance notice (even to me).

To apply for FTP access to ripem.msu.edu, send an email message
to ripem@ripem.msu.edu.   State the following:

1.  Your citizenship (must be USA or Canadian) 
2.  Your willingness to comply with relevant export laws.
3.  Your willingness to comply with relevant software license terms.
    (You should get and read the file "rsaref-license.txt" on this host, 
    so you know what you are agreeing to if you get RIPEM.)  
4.  The "canonical" Internet domain name of your host.
    (If you are not sure of the primary name of your host, FTP to
    ripem.msu.edu under user anonymous.  The FTP server will inform
    you of your hostname.)  Also state the country in which your host
    resides.

*****
***** NOTE:  It is very important that you get the hostname correct.
*****        As odd as it may seem, many requestors have
*****        not correctly specified their host address.  This
*****        causes extra effort for both of us.  Please check
*****        (via anonymous FTP) unless you are certain of your
*****        hostname as known by domain name servers.  Your
*****        hostname does *** NOT *** have an "@" in it, and
*****        in general cannot be derived from your email address.
*****

Here's a sample email message you might send to ripem@ripem.msu.edu:

To: ripem@ripem.msu.edu
Subject: Access to ripem.msu.edu

   Dear Mark,

   Please give me access to ripem.msu.edu.  I am an American
   citizen, and I agree to comply with crypto export laws and
   RSAREF license terms.  My hostname is hobbit.egr.bigu.edu;
   this host is located in the United States.

   Thank you.

When I receive your message, with luck I'll promptly issue you
a special FTP username and password by return email.  This username 
will work only from the hostname you specify in your message.

In the case of RIPEM, you may redistribute the code, but only
to others in the USA and Canada, and only under the terms of
the RSAREF license agreement mentioned above.

Thank you.

This method of distribution is due to local site requirements 
and is not required by RSAREF license terms, FYI.

Mark Riordan   mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu

P.S.  I realize that going through this account application process 
is not your idea of a good time.  It doesn't take much imagination
to figure that it isn't my idea of a good time, either.  Please
help this process go smoothly by giving me all the informative
requested above, so I can issue your account on the first try.
I receive hundreds of these requests and many are lacking information.

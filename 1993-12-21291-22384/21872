Is there any easy way to do this?  I have an old bunch of mail that I 
tarred and then crypted a ways back.  The password I thought I used isn't 
working at all, so I assume I used a different one.  In any event, I'm 
sure it's not all that difficult, but running a dictionary through it 
could take a while :(.  Perhaps there is some sort of method that 'crypt' 
uses, or some header information that would be in the tar file?  Any 
suggestions would be appricated.  As I said though, I'd rather something 
that won't take several days to do.  After all, it's just a bunch of old 
mail with some source code and stuff in it.  Thanks,
							Tom

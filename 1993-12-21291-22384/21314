I didn't notice this in the FAQ, so I was wondering if someone
could answer an RSA question for me.
 
I have read that factorization of the modulus in an RSA public
key (E,N) will give one the information necessary to decipher the
message.
 
Is the reverse true?  If I have a method of breaking RSA, is
there a way to use that to factor the modulus?  Specifically, if
someone is enciphering using X^E MOD N, and I have an algorithm
which returns X given X^E, is there is systematic way to use that
algorithm to find a D such that X = (X^E)^D or distinct odd
primes P and Q such that N = P*Q.
 
I had initially thought that this was the case, but some
experimentation has shown that being able to invert the
permutation used for encipherment does not lead in an obvious way
to either D or P and Q.  At least it isn't obvious to me.

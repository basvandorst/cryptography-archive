In my cryptanalysis post, I described it.

It's just like DES, except:

- There is no 32->48-bit expansion.
- The subkey is added (mod 2^32) to the half rather than XORed.
- The S-boxes are 4 bits wide, not 6.
- The final permutation is a rotate left (i.e. in the direction
  of the carry of the above add) by 11 bits.
- There are 32 rounds, not 16.

The contents of the S-boxes are not specified by the standard.
I picked the first row of each of the DES S-box tables for
illustrative purposes.

The key is 256 bits, and takes the form of 8 32-bit words.  They are
used in the order 01234567012345670123456776543210 during encryption
and the reverse (01234567765432107654321076543210) during decryption.

Like the DES, there is no swap after the last round.

There are no initial and final permutations.

Oh, yes, the standard is consistently little-endian, unlike the DES,
which is big-endian.

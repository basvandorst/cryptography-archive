Could someone point me in the right driection here, I am trying to 
put together a technical paper for school focussing on the pro's
and con's of simple commercial password protected files such as 
WordPerfect passwords, Word password etc.. I have found pretty 
decent programs to crack files from these pieces of software, but
what I am having trouble with is find something to crack Zip
files that have been password encrypted.  I have come accross
two utilities (PK-Crack, and ZipCrack2) but neither of them
comes up with a reliable solution (I also need source to explain
to the prof how its done, Pk-Crack comes with it but Zip-Crack
doesn't). Anyway, can someone help?

Mark.

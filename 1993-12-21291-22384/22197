Does anyone know an FTP site for an un-zipped version of the GOST 28147-89
spec, or can some kind soul Email me a copy?  I'm trying to get a copy
in a hurry, and I'm having some UNIX->MULTICS->MSDOS compatibility
problems that trash any zipped files in the process of downloading them
(even with -binary).

Thanks for the help.

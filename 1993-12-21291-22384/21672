You can generate 384 bit primes witha certificate in 12 sec. on a SPARC IPX and 512 bit ones in 45 sec.! I do this on a regular basis, thanks also to PARI assembler routines for arithmetic. It can even be done twice as fast with a little more work. I do not know on PC's, but assembler provided, the results should be comparable.

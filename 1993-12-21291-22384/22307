Just for the record, I thought that I'd mention my disk encryption
program *for Amiga computers only* called CrypDisk. It can be found
on any aminet ftp site (*) in dev/crypt/crypdisk.zoo. It uses IDEA on
the sector level, and is basically just a quick hack based on vague
descriptions of "diskreet". If anybody sees any glaring security holes,
apart from any in the original implementation, I'd like to hear
about them.

I used the IDEA implementation from the xpkIDEA.library, and this
incorporates mc68000 assembly code from Andre Beck and Colin Plumb.


(*) I just checked that it hasn't fallen off ftp.luth.se yet, but it
should be available on all mirrors as well, including the main site
wuarchive.wustl.edu. (Note for the paranoid: I uploaded it to luth.se,
not to wuarchive)

-Olaf.

How can I get access to Moby phrases?  I would like to extract the 
phrases, organize them in some way (just how is not clear to me yet), and 
test them against ACA patristocrats for efficacy.

I have found an online pattern word dictionary to be quite successful for 
solving ACA aristocrats.  These are simple substitution ciphers with 
proper word divisions.  In fact, they can be automatically solved with 
such a dictionary.  But this approach depends on word divisions, and so I 
want to try phrases instead of words, arranged somehow so that patterns 
are recognized without word divisions.

By extension, it should be possible to extend the dictionary to 
"isomorphic" patterns, such as the short dictionary shown in Friedman's 
Military Cryptanalysis, to solve Playfairs.

I don't quite get how Moby parts of speech will help.

   Phil Karn and another chap at Bellcore whose name escapes me right now
   invented something called S-Key which accomplishes much of what
   is being discussed here without most of the problems.  They have 
   been using it for a couple of years now.  I think there is a document
   describing it up for FTP somewhere - thumper.bellcore.com maybe?
   Phil? are you reading this?

Phil Karn and Neil Haller.  It uses MD4 as a one-way function.  Its a
nice way to authenticate using a one-time password.  The only problem
is that you don't get a shared secret (like you do if you could use
Kerberos), so you can't easily encrypt the session after you
authenticate.

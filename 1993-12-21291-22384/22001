I was wondering if Secure Drive has been examined for weaknesses by 
anyone who is competent to do so.  Is this program considered to be 
solid?  And has anyone reported any bugs?

Last night I figured out how to get the program to work with doublespace,
and that means using secure drive to protect my hard drive is practical
for me, and I was wondering if it's worth the trouble to do so.

Thanks...

Yes.

No. The encrypted stuff is a pseudo-randomly selected 128-bit number.
The pseudo-random number generator is cryptographically strong.
Besides, AFAIK, there are no known attacks against RSA based on the
fact that you have several cyphertexts which represent one and the
same plaintext, encrypted with several public keys.

IDEA has nothing to do here, except that the "plaintext" is actually
the session key used to IDEA-encrypt the message. This session key is
encrypted with RSA, so you should look into such attacks in RSA. I am
not aware of any successful ones.

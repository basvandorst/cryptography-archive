The address I have is:

Access Data Recovery
87 East 600 South
Orem, UT 84058      [ just a stone's throw from Novell, WP -- and
(801) 224-6970         the Osmond family's recording studio!! ]

I'm not aware that they say they can crack PKZip, but they apparently do
claim to crack the other stuff you mentioned, as well as 1-2-3, Quattro
Pro, and Paradox.

I believe the Novell package is $245.  It can only be loaded at the file
server, and if you change the Network Supervisor's password, it instantly
broadcasts the fact to *all* network users.  So think twice before taking
up a collection in the office to play an April Fool's joke on your Evil
Fascist Humor-Impaired Net.Supervisor...:-)

BTW, there are scads of freeware WP 5.x password-cracking programs
scattered around the Net and bbs's...dunno about 6.0, though.

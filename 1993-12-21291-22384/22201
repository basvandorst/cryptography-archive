Random?  No.  A function could only be random if, given f(x)=z,
the z result would be totally unpredictable, even given the same input
x each time.

There are, however, lots of various algorhithms for pseudorandom
functions.   A pseudorandom function is one that, (in theory),
for every x, f(x) is basically unpredictable, except for a given
range.  To be useful, it should at least pass a chi square
statistical attack.

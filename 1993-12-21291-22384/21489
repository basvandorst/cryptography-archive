Cryptographic hash functions are always non-reversible (because
they map elements of an infinite set into a finite set).

When one-way functions are used in ciphers, they have to be
combined with other elements to create reversible functions.
If you look at the Feistel structure of DES, you'll see that
the round function is composed of a one-way function, f, and
an XOR.

If the left and right blocks are called L and R, respectively,
one DES round is:

1. L = L, R = R XOR f(L,k[i])
2. Swap L and R.

If you perform the first line twice, you'll have
   L = L, R = R XOR f(L,k[i]) XOR f(L,k[i])
which equals
   L = L, R = R.

So the XOR actually transforms the one-way f into an involution
(i.e. function which is its own inverse).

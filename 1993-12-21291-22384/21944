What if you generated an arbitrary number of cards, each with an index
number, and required that the _cards_ be used sequentially, but the
passwords on each card could be used in any order?

Say, for example, I was using my card #12, after having circular-filed
cards 1-11, and with cards 13-??? locked in my office safe.  I can use
the passwords on #12 in any order, crossing them out as I go.  Then I
leave #12 in a jacket unattended for an hour.  Did someone see it and
copy a few passwords?  No worries; I just pop #13 out of the safe and
log in with one of its passwords.  As soon as the login program
validates a password from card #n, it wipes the hash files for cards
numbered lower than n.  Thus, card #12 becomes worthless.

In this way, no specific action would be required to invalidate a lost
or compromised card.  If the login program reported no logins since
your last known login, the breach wouldn't even have to be reported.
A careless user wouldn't have to fear for his job over a misplaced or
laundered card; he'd just grab the next card, log in and keep working.

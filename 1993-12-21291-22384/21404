Yes, the most important part of using PGP is to use a version that has
not been tampered with.  (For discussion of other weaknesses look at recent
posting in alt.security.pgp, if you can).

For this particular door the answer is simple.  Use a different copy of PGP,
(one that hasn't been tampered with, eg from a different ftp site).
"pgp <filename>" will examine the file and tell you how many public keys can
access the message, and if their public keys are in your keyring it will
tell you who those keys belong to.

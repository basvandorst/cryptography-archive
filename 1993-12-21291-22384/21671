I do not understand why one would use Lucas tests. They make the stuff just slower! It is true that Lucas pseudoprimes are harder to find, since the Lucas totient function \psi is more complex than the Euler totinet function \phi. But there is no reason for believing they do not exist!
On the other hand for mere prime generation for crypto use, one can get *proved* primes, as quickly - or even faster - than probable primes (of any brand: Lucas, Rabin - Miller, Fermat ...). Ueli Maurer suggested it three years ago, and ... I ... presented this year at Eurocrypt an algorithm for fast generation of provable primes. It is faster than Rabin - Miller in its best versions and has the only disadvantage that it produces just about every one in 2000 primes of length 384 bits. Thinking there are ab
out 2^376 such primes, this does not bother me too much; if it does bother you, use probable primes! If you *believe* in things like strong primes, they are particularly easy to be produced with a provable procedure. Only, no primes are stronger than average against elliptic factorization!

Yep. Someone broke into all our BBS's, shelled to DOS, copied a new PGP 
over the old one, not one byte changed.... Then all the compilers now 
recognize that code. And what beats all. They did it on my 2400 baud 
modem, with me sitting right here, no entry into the sysop log, no 
unexplained disk accesses...
 
UFO's beamed down and told me they need my socks.....
 
(Don't worry... With morons like an54588 on the net, it gets stupider)

Okay, okay, so I got a little confused.  I messed up because Robbie and
"Robot" were both in one episode of Lost in Space, and they were sort of
competing, because Robbie could do just about everything better.  But in
the end, Robbie was found to be evil, and Robot was loyal and risked his
neck to save one of the kids from Robbie, and thus saved his job.

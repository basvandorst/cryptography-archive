The 'replacements' are official, tested & licensed implementations of
RSA produced by RSADSI.  These replace the RSA code contributed to PGP.
The use of this 'genuine' code is probably a requirement of ViaCrypt's
license arrangement with RSADSI, so that the can safely and accurately
say that the product uses RSA encryption.  (This may also apply to the
MD5 digest code used to generate signatures).

This would be similar to a PC supplier being allowed to describe their
products as having an Intel CPU only if the CPU was a genuine Intel part,
and not a 'compatible' part from AMD, Cyrix, Texas, ...

   How many  `instructions' has mankind executed so far?

   Let me give one ground rule: an instruction is counted iff it
   was executed on a manufactured device (ie no meatware).

Ok, I'm game.  The estimate below is doubtless wrong, but it's the best
I can come up with.

I'll assume that there are about 1 billion machines today, including
everything from calculators, through automotive engine controllers
through to supercomputers.   I'll assume that the average compute power
is 1MIPS; the true spread lying between four orders of magnitude error
bounds, from 100IPS calculators to 10GIPS supers.  I'll further assume
that they work for 1/3 of the time  -- most calculators and car engines
are used less than this; most workstations, mainframes and supers work
continually.   Let me further assume that all these machines have had
an effective lifetime of ten years.   Most are newer than that, but at
least we compensate for ignoring the previous few millenia  (I'm
including movement of beads on an abacus, slides of a slide rule and
handle-turning of a mechanical calculator as "instructions", as well as
electronic clockticks).

Ok, multiplying this lot together we get 1e9 (machines) * 1e6 (IPS) *
3e7 (s/yr) * 1/3 (load factor) * 10 (years lifetime), or 1e23.

Given that the number of machines and their power is increasing
exponentially -- doubling every couple of years or so, we can predict
that we will have executed one mole of instructions by the end of the
century.

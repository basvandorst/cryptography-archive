The cipher is just like DES, except that it has 32 rounds, the key
schedule is generated differently, and instead of the core function
being Permute(Substitute(key[round] ^ Expand(x))), the core operation
is RotateLeft11(Substitute(key[round] + x)).

That is, you change the XOR to an addition, you omit the expansion and
use 4-to-4 bit S-boxes, and the permutation is much simpler; in
particular it does not make sure each output bit from any given S-box
goes into a different S-box input next round.

See Eli Biham and Adi Shamir, _Differential Cryptanalysis of the Data
Encryption Standard_ (Springer-Verlag 1993, ISBN 0-387-97930-1 and
3-540-97930-1) sections 4.5.3.1, 4.5.6 and 4.5.1, respectively, for
the effects on the DES of making each of these changes.  All of them
weaken it, and omitting the permutation and the expansion do so
quite drastically.

The standard does not define the S-boxes, saying they are a parameter of
the communication network the cipher is used in.  Even though the cipher
uses 32 rounds instead of DES's 16, the attacks illustrated by Biham and
Shamir make me doubtful that strong S-box choices exist.

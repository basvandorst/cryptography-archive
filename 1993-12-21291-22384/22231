One option that may be available is to take the crypto out of secure drive,
and include a encryption spec for what an ecryption routine must do
in order to interface with the secure drive code.  Then someone outside
the US could implement his own encryption code and distribute it without
US interfearance.

I guess you could create a "export version", with no encryption, or just
simple xor the drive with the md5 hash or somthing. :)

But whatever, it should be mike's call.

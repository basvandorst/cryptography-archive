I still fail to see why sending your credit card number by e-mail is
much more risky than, say, paying with it at you neighborhood
supermarket, thus allowing the cashier and other staff to know it.  So
what if somebody snoops at the e-mail and misuses the card number, or
if somebody of the shop staff misuses it.  In both cases the credit
card company simply has to take your word for it that the items
wrongly charged to the credit card weren't from transactions by you,
the rightful owner, and cancel the charge.  Isn't this the normal way
that credit cards work?

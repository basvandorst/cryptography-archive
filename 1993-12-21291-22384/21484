If you're talking about the MDC encryption algorithm then there is no need 
for the central block transformation to be reversible.  The algorithm runs 
in CFB (cipher feedback) mode, in which the block transformation (be it DES, 
IDEA, MD5, or SHS) is only ever run in one direction (usually encrypt-only 
in the case of reversible ciphers like DES and IDEA).  However since there 
is no need for the block transformation to be reversible, it's possible to 
use transformations with better properties than IDEA and DES, namely ones 
which are faster, have a larger block size and key space, and aren't covered 
by patents.  For example the encrypting filesystem I'm about to release uses 
SHS as its block transformation and runs at several hundred kb per second on 
a vanilla '386, with a block size of 160 bits and key size of 512 bits 
(these particular properties are mainly a function of SHS).  Using triple 
DES or IDEA would have slowed the system to an unacceptable speed, and 
probably provided less security.

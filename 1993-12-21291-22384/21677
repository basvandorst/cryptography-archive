Yes. Regarding that particular backddor that you describe (limiting
the range of the possible session keys), I have a pretty good
understanding of how it is done and have examined that part of the
source rather closely.

You obviously deny the possibility of other people besides NSA and the
authors of PGP to have eyes and brains. :-)

That would be Ron Rivest's RFC1320.

It is not; it uses a variant of forth known as RPL (Reverse Polish
Lisp, RPL Programmers Language), and is not a 32 bit machine. As such,
implementing MD4 is slightly more complicated.

Since it appears no one has done so, I'll write one sometime this week,
depending on how busy I am (and how much of a pain carrying around
these s/key keys on paper is).

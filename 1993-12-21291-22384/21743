   Of course not. Even different versions of the same compiler are unlikely to 
produce the same code. Depending on the optimization technology used, very small
changes in the source can result in fairly wide sweeping changes in the 
generated code.

   I can assure folks that no such spooks have been placed in IBM's OS/2 C and 
C++ compilers. It would be very difficult to do, difficult to hide unless you 
reproduced that moby hack talked about before -- but if you did pull it off, it 
would be even more difficult -- and I know of only a few people around here 
capable of doing something like that -- and none of them would be in the least 
bit inclined to do it. We have very tight schedules -- no time for that
sort of thing. The guy who started all this either must think he has a great
sense of humor, or he's seriously paraniod. (Not that paranoids don't have 
enemies -- just not as many as they think.)

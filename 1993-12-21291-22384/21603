All of these schemes lead to worries about a evil-doer putting a big
antenna near your computer, and transmitting strong enough to overload
whatever noise was there - then he will have a good idea of the bit
pattern. 

On the Apple II (remember?) they had a 16-bit counter which
was incremented while waiting for keypresses, and xored with another
variable every time a keypress was detected. This gave a nice random
seed for a conventional RNG. I guess it's hard to do this in an
unix/X-windows world, where keyboards & cpus may only talk over the
network.

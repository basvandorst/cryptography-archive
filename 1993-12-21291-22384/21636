This is not true.  I posted the correct statement in another article in
this thread.

   primality reduce the risk of getting a pseudo-prime if the pseudo-prime 
   is a Carmichael number?  Naively, it seems to me that repeating an 
   insufficient test n times just makes the test n times slower without a 
   compensating increase in assurance.

Not all composite numbers numbers which fail *one* Fermat test to a
particular base are Carmichael numbers.  Suppose you test one of them,
and it fails.  If you re-test with another base, you might (probably
will) get lucky and prove it composite this time.

   Please tell me I misunderstand!

OK.   You misunderstood.   8-)

   BTW, I would still like an estimate of how difficult it is to get a 
   Carmichael number instead of a prime when you begin with a random string 
   of digits.

Very difficult.  How difficult depends on how big the number is.  For
kilobit numbers, about one in 700 is prime.  About one in 10^19 is a
Carmichael number, if I remember correctly.

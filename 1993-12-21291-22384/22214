Actually, I think the deal with the test phrase is that RSA uses it if they
call you, to validate that it's them. As long as you keep it secret, and
change it once they use it (in case of wiretaps), that should be o.k., since
they originally got it encrypted with the key you're registering.

I misstated things when I said "prove YOU'RE who YOU say".

If the NSA has time to read my e-mail, I wish they'd send me a bloody 
monthly summary! 
No actually its all true. I just disassembled my Visual C++ compiler 
using a home-brew ICE2. Sure enough, I found this wierd code that was all 
wrapped up with a bunch of interrupts that turn of single-stepping. THe 
code was encoded, so I couldn't read it, but I thought, "Well, if this is 
the code to break the PGP..." I loaded the ascii file into my debugger 
and jumped to the location of the coded code, sure enough, I got the 
following listing out...

   mov AH, LX[1233]
   compsb  _PGP_PREFIX
   jmp     MagickProc

I am still working on a carefull disassembly of the piece of code called 
magickproc. If I am sucessfull, I am going to blow the whistle right 
away. Excuse me, some guy in a black suit is at the door. Get right back 
to you.....

Fortunately, none of these foreign sites have posted Secure Drive.
I've sent mail to all of the site administrators asking them not
to post the program. It is illegal for me to export it. If you are
in the U.S. or Canada and want a copy, send me email. If you are
outside the U.S. and Canada, Peter Gutmann in New Zealand will be
introducing SFS, another disk-encryption program, soon.

AN52210 deliberately broke the law, and ignored my request not to
export this program. That was not a very nice thing to do, Mr. Anon.
If you want to challenge the ITAR, write your own code and export
it. But don't cause trouble for someone else while hiding behind
an anonymous remailer. I sent him a flame on the subject; if anyone
else thought this was a nasty thing to do, feel free to tell him so!
People like you, Mr. Anon, do not encourage others to write more code.

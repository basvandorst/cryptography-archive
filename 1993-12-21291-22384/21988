The encryption is not very strong, but far from trivial to break. As
far as I know, nobody can do it on an arbitrary encrypted ZIP archive.

All such programs that I know either use brute force (i.e., try all
possible passwords), or use a dictionary attack (try a large number of
dictionary words, because people tend to use them as passwords). The
first method is essentially useless if a passowrd longer than 6
characters is used. The second method is useless if the password is
not in the dictionary used.

In your particular case, I would advise you to try to recall how your
password looked like and to create a dictionary containing all those
forms. A dictionary-based ZIP password cracker is available in source
from our ftp site:

ftp.informatik.uni-hamburg.de:/pub/virus/texts/crypto/pkcrack.zip

It aslo contains a text file, describing the encryption algorithm in
PKZIP and the archive format.

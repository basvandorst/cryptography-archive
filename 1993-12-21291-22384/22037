	I've a firend who is Tempest Certified.  He has acquired, with no
	problems, at flea markets, a number of tempest items.  Including
	complete PC systems.  And he knows what he is buying...

	In addition, thos who can demonstrate a sincere desire and ability have
	access.  Check the "Industrial TEMPEST Program", or close to that.  The
	original "you need clearance to get the stanard to see if you can meet
	the standard etc," turned out to be too conviluted to be workable...

There is a program called Secure Drive which comes with source.
Distribution is hampered by outdated US laws, but it might be

The Norton Utilities come with a program called Diskreet.
The US features two kinds of encryption: DES and a propriety
encryption. The 'european' version has only propriety
encryption.

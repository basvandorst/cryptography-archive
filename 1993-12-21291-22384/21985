Darn, I don't have access to that.

Got that.

I was just thinking that with base 2, the Fermat test can be optimized
significantly, since modular multiplication by twois simpler than modular
addition.

Or the combination of that and a Lucas test that seems to be popular
lately.

Grumble, moan, bitch.  It'll take some hunting, although it sounds good.

Now, this soulds interesting.  Does anyone have details before I manage
to track down the proceedings and see them first-hand?

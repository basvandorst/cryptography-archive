Sure, vulnerabilities as you describe exist.

For example, with my Adobe font CDROM, to get a key which
unlocks any particular font family (if they were clever,
they could permit you to purchase a key that would open any
arbitrary subset of fonts on the disk) I call up the vendor,
give them my serial number which is computed from my registration
name and CDROM disk ID. They give me the fifteen letter code(s)
to type into the unlocking applet.

I could, of course, trace execution of the vendor key until it
became an actual font key for any CD ROM with my CDROM master's ID.
I could then publish this key and anyone with the same CDROM
master ID could hack the unlock applet to unlock that font.

But wouldn't it be much easier just to mail my cohorts the damn font
itself?  Then they wouldn't have to have that particular master
CDROM disk. Besides, consider the law.  To traffic in passwords or
keys is a felony in California, while violating copyright may or may
not be a federal crime depending on number of copies, worth of the
program, and so on. From a thief's point-of-view, it is much better
to use PGP and your fellow conspirator's public key to just send the
data itself.

I think the unlocking scheme works well to keep honest people honest.

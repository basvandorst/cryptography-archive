I still think it was "The Sum of All Fears".  Most of the "Cardinal" plot
involved low-tech methods by agents-in-place in Moscow.  I have no idea
whether the CIA could use such a method in the real world, because of the
difficulty of smuggling such high-tech equipment into hostile territory.  As
I recall, the new cryptosystem was being developed for the State Department
for use with diplomatic traffic between foreign embassies.  That usage is
more realistic, since the use of crypto systems is expected under such
circumstances, and the CD-ROM "keys" could be transported via diplomatic
pouches ahead of time.

A real world example is the encrypted message from Tokyo to the Japanese
Embassy in the US in 1941 relaying Japan's declaration of war.  The delay in
decryption of the text caused it to be delivered *AFTER* the Pearl Harbor
attack, and intensifying America's resolve to beat Japan.  Also, as I
recall, our crypto people decoded MOST of the message BEFORE the Japanese
did!

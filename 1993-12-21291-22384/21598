   Here's excerpts from PGP 2.3's genprime.c.  It appears they're using Fermat.
   Maybe they have reasons for choosing it over Rabin-Miller.

I suspect the reason is incompetence.  I submitted a Rabin-Miller test
to the developers.  With luck, it might be used in the next version.

If I wasn't so damned busy, I would try to get around to writing a Lucas
test as well.  No-one knows of a single composite number which fails a
Miller-Rabin test to base 2 and a Lucas test with P=1, Q=(1-D)/4, D as
the least |D| in 5, -7, 9, -11, 13, -15, ... for which jacobi(D/n) = -1

(Credit to Bob Silverman for supplying that information.  No, I do not
want to explain what a Lucas test is.  Go look it up.)

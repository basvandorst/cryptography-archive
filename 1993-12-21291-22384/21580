In discussing encryption algorithms, one of my Comp Sci textbooks
offhandedly suggested that the way to generate random numbers is to "amplify
the quantum noise in a resistor." I know nothing at all about EE, so I don't
even know if this was tongue-in-cheek.

Is this feasable? Or desirable? What about using some other "natural"
sources of randomness?

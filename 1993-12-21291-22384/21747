Paul Zimmerman != Phil Zimmerman
Craig Steingold != Craig Shergold
GCC Compiler attack != PCC Compiler attack

Craig Shergold is (and has been for about 10 years now) a 7 yr old kid who
wanted to collect postcards before he died of some fatal illness, who
unfortunately recovered; meanwhile do-gooders the world over continue
to flood his home, his hospital, and the UK postal system with get-well cards.
Not to mention several American scams trying to make money out of the ongoing
momentum of what is turning into an urban legend, and a con that involves
getting address lists of *really* gullible people by collecting their business
cards for 'young craig'...

The attack on the compiler to hide a trojan in the login program was
a paper by ken Richie in the early days of Unix.  As far as i know, he never
actually implemented it.  (Or if he did, he certainly never released it.
Of course, you could always ask him if you really wanted to know for sure)

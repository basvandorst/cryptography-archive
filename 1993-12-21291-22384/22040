I saw a promo today for a future NOVA on PBS that promised to
reveal heretofor secret stuff about 'purple' encryption, in
use by 1939. Unlike the Enigma cipher with its gears, it used
relays. I may have missed the exact context, but it seemed they
were saying full text of Japanese messages of Dec 6th, 1941 had
been sent to State late in the day. I think it's due to run in
January or February, 1994. Anybody know any more?

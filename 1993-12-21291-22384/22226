With all due respect, spelling and grammar are essential tools to ensure your
meaning is transmitted to others with clarity, especially in English where
there is considerable latitude allowed.  Telepathy is not supported by the
Internet, to my knowledge, so you must take responsibility for your 'meaning'
by minding your spelling and grammatical Ps and Qs.  In technical terms,
spelling and/or grammatical errors function the same way noise does to degrade
signal integrity.  Effective communication in a two-dimensional, monochromatic,
serial channel is hard enough, don't complicate the process with unnecessary
error.  For those reading this and find spelling and/or grammatical error(s),
please don't nit pick.  As a notoriously bad speller and even worse
grammatician,
I am very symphatetic to the problem (when on-line time is money, time to
refer to a dictionary can be expensive), but I object to the attitude that
the rules are secondary.  Without the rules we have no communicative meaning.

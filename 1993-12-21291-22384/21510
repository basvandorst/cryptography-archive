Since I prefer not to hire an attorney to provide me with legal advice
in this matter, I'm going to play things safe and not release a version
of KFS without crypto in it.  I may have a better idea.

I could implement KFS with a "proprietary" weak cipher in it that would
be of a type likely to be approved by the Customs Department.  Assuming
the expense is not to high, I could then apply for an export license for
my code.  Once it was granted, other people would be free to replace my
"proprietary" cipher with one of their choice.  This protects me, and at
the same time allows people outside of the U.S. and Canada to have KFS.

Anyone know what I need to do to apply for an export license?

And, while I'm at it...

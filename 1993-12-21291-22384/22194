   Really? Try playing a little bit more. Do you really claim that you
   can recover the key if you have the plaintext and the cyphertext?
   Wanna bet?


Ok, Vesselin, I'm game.  I bet that (subject to certain conditions
hinted at below) if you give me 8 bytes of plain text and the
corresponding 8 bytes of DES/ECB-encrypted cypher text, I can recover
the key.  Of course, I'm not promising that I can do it very quickly,
but I can do it if the incentive is great enough.

For instance, if you were to pay me $100million on completion, I could
build a DES keysearch machine for much less than that which would give
me the answer within a year or so.  I estimate that a few thousand
microcomputers would suffice.  I would also require *very* good
guarantees that you would pay up in full, so that I could borrow the
money for the keysearch engine using your stake as collateral.


Being a little more serious now, I rather doubt that Seth can solve
the problem in less than a long time, using only resources he now has.

Depends on the cyphers used. It can make it unbreakable (if OTP is one
of the cyphers), not make any difference (if the two encryptions are a
group), or make it trivial to break.

As far as I know, nobody can break PGP's encryption. Therefore,
passwording the ZIP file is not necessary. And, if somebody *can*
break PGP's encryption, then breaking PKZIP's encryption should be
trivial to them. Of course, I am talking about cryptanalysis here, not
about dirty tricks like snooping your PGP passphrase and snatching
your secret keyring.

In your place I wouldn't feel that safe. Of course, it depends on how
sensitive your stuff is, and how determined the attacker might be (and
how you select your passwords, of course). If you want to protect from
some "friend" who steals your encrypted files, the above should be OK.
If you want to protect from a determined corporate or government
adversary - it definitely isn't. My advice - don't encrypt the ZIP
archive and use PGP instead of Norton. It's more secure and no more
cumbersome. Or use HPACK instead of ZIP - then you don't need
additional encryption.

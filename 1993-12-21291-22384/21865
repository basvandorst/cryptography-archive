   Woops. On closer inspection I was using Rabin-Miller, a test derived
   from Fermat's, not plain Fermat.

In which case, that's roughly what I'd expect.  Only 10^-3 of your
random numbers are likely to be prime; only 10^-18 or so will be
a MR pseudoprime to a give base.  The odds are heavily in your
favour that the numbers passing the first test are indeed prime and
so will pass all subsequent tests.

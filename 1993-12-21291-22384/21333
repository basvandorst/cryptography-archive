 I haven't examined you source in depth, but it looks like something
between a Ceasur cipher and a Vengeri (spelling not quite right) cipher.

 In a Ceasur cipher the plaintext is offset by some
constant value (the key), while a Vengere cipher users a table to
determine the offset of the plaintext on a character by character basis.

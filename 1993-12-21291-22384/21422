I do not undertand what this is all about? Just *how many* composite numbers have the property of being factors of a"pseudoprime" (what kind - it appears to be Carmichael numbers that are aluded to)? Obviously only (or at most) these numbers can be easily factored by the given method. On the other hand, there are many families of composites which can be easier factored than the average. For instance products of prime twins (p and p+2 primes), etc. These seem to be at least as widely spread as the pseudopri
me factors.

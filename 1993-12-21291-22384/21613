You make a good point. But I still feel that (staying with PGP) it is for 
users to understand the validation mechanism provided and to determine whether, 
for their intended use, it can give adequate security. I believe that in 
particular circumstances and within closed user groups with a central 
validating authority, it can give good security. However, promiscuous use of 
the validation mechanism must end in tears sooner or later.   

Someone who asks for my public key and then uses it to communicate with me
after confirming the fingerprint has a pretty fair assurance that that
communication will not be read by a third party. What they can have little or
 no assurance of, if we are strangers, is that I am who I say I am or, even 
if I am me, I may actualy be a malevolent SOB. 

On the other hand, if my key is provided/signed by a party absolutely trusted 
**for the high value purposes of our correspondence only** then the mechanism 
seems quite adequate with only care needed in its implementation. And it sure 
is easier and cheaper to maintain good key security on international 
connections than any single key cipher I know.

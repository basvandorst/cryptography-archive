The use of Carmichael numbers is neither alluded to, implied or required
but also, not excluded. Ribenboim(1991) tells me that there is only a finite
number of 3-factors Carmichael numbers but an infinity of all other kinds.
In my example the number M is a 3-factors pseudoprime but it is not a
Carmichael number. Anyway, my idea implies only that N is a composite
factor of M (presumably, any 3-factors pseudoprime).
The real question is this: Can we construct a 3-factors pseudoprime when
the product of two of its factors is known. If it can proven that such a
construction is not possible or is prohibitively expensive then we may
consider shelving our idea. Meanwhile, any results, proofs, etc. that may
shed light on this fascinating subject is welcomed.

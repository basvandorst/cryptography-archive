Unfortunately, the protocols involved in credit-card use are sufficiently
brain-damaged that an adversary knowing your card *number* (not secret PIN)
can do a great deal of damage.  For instance, in the UK, they can make
telephone calls anywhere in the world off your card - the only other info
they need is your date of birth, which is public knowlege.

See comp.risks or one of the alt.privacy groups for more details.

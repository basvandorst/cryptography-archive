    The universe has roughly 10^22 stars.  The sun produces about 10^27 watts.
Assuming all stars produce about that much, that gives us 10^49 watts.  Assume
the energy dissipated per logic operation can be 10^-21 joules (note that this
is high.  Energies much smaller than this should be feasible, and at
room temperature.  Energy dissipation per logic operation well below
kT will be feasible).  That gives us 10^70 logic operations a second.  Continue
for however many billions of years you think the universe will last.  For one
billion years, we get roughly 10^9*3*10^7 ~ 10^17 seconds, or 10^87.  Divide
by the number of logic operations per instruction to convert to instructions.
Very roughly, this might be 10^6 or 10^7 logic operations per instruction.
This would give us about 10^80 instructions per billion years.  I do not
know how many billions of years the universe will last.

It is conceivable that much higher values are possible.  The known laws of
physics might be modified or altered in the future.  In the context of the
known laws, I know of no proof that logic devices must necessarily be made
from atoms (though this is a plausible conjecture).  It has been argued
by some authors that the universe would support unlimited computation.

Further, there is no proof that energy dissipation per logic operation must
exceed any fixed bound if the logic operation is reversible.  The use of the
value 10^-21 joules per logic operation must therefore be viewed as suspect.
Lower values are certainly possible, and *much* lower values might be possible.

   Cheers!

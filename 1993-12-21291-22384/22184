I am _seriously_ considering offering general-purpose support for
"algebraicilly-defined" arbitrary authentication algorithms in my
company's user authentication software products. If we decide to go
ahead with this, supervisors could assign any kind of mathematical
algorithm they could describe, for use by any user. Users could then
use any means at their disposal to satisfy the challenge. I'm still
soliciting opinions on this idea....

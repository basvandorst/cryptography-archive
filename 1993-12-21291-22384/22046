totient(p^n) = (p-1)*p^(n-1)
totient(a*b) = totient(a) * totient(b), where gcd(a,b) = 1.

These two let you find the totient for any number of known factorisation
easily.

totient(2^i+2^(i-1)) = totient(3*2^(i-1)) = totient(3) * totient(2^(i-1)) =
2 * 2^(i-2) * 1 = 2^(i-1).

For totient(2^i+2^(i+k)), it's 2^(i-1) * totient(1+2^k).
For the first few numbers of that form, it's
totient(3) = 2
totient(5) = 4
totient(7) = 6
totient(9) = 6
totient(11) = 10
totient(13) = 12
totient(15) = 8

The first few odd primere odd primes, which causes considerable confusion.

The Euler totient function is at the heart of RSA encryption.  To know the
totient of p*q, where p and q are primes, is to know the factorisation.
(Well, that and the quadratic equation gives it to you.)

Yes, tremendously.  However, given that it's equivalent to factoring, I
don't think you're likely to find a solution soon.

Moreover, Benett have proved any computation may be done with any low energy :
there are no thermodynamic lower bound to the energy cost of computation. This
is equivalent to the ability to compute with a reversible machine.

See : Benett (1982) International Journal of Theorical Phisics, 21, 905.

I believe the limit of computation is a question of time : logical computation
has a time lower bound.

I dunno. It's _extremely_ easy for me to grab passwords using "netwatch"
on a PC attached to our ethernet. I got public-domain _source_code_ for
netwatch _free_ of charge from several Internet archive sites. No math,
no CPU-intensive crunching, just a careful examination of log files....

True... I guess what I am after is a sense of whether this is _enough_
better than replayable passwords to attract interest. I'll put you 
down as "doubtful"....  Maybe it depends on whether you are trying
to protect yourself from datacomm types or mathematicians?

Agreed. There are more than half a dozen such devices available now,
all supported in host-resident software or in servers from various
security companies like mine. Costs are much more than $3.00 per
copy, however.

Agreed.

Some do, though. Many have sqrt. Others have square. Some others have
invert. It would be interesting to see the combinations that would
emerge from, say 2 keystrokes on calculators under $4.00

Agreed.

So far my mail has been running about 50% in favor versus against this
idea. I have reached no conclusions.

Thanks for further insights.

FWIW, I agree

I think the primary reason for dealing with shift registers is that they
code required to implement them is much faster than that required for
bizarre polynomials. 

Another related issue is the attempt to make RNGs mimic an uniform
distribution. I would think any distribution that is both locally and
globally unpredictable would be as good even if it deviated significantly
from an uniform distribuiton. Maybe someone else can join in and comment.

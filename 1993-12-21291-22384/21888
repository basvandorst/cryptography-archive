Dear Sir, Madam, 

Please find enclosed our information package on the 1994 PROMPT Anniversary 
Conference. In case you do not know us: PROMPT is the Dutch user group for 
all Hewlett-Packard calculators and handheld computers. 

We celebrate our 10th anniversary in 1994, and we have organized a number 
of activities to celebrate this. One of them was inviting numerous 'famous' 
HP personalities to write a guest article for our journal throughout 1993. 

Another, and perhaps the most important event will be the conference in 1994. 
To take care of organizational matters, we have established a separate 
foundation, HPCALC. After a relative long period of silence since the 1992 
HPCC London conference, we are in a position now to start taking registrations.

The information enclosed comprises general information on the conference, 
a registration form, and a call for papers. To ensure that the conference 
will be a great success:

                  Please spread the word!

We ask you to distribute the enclosed information to as many interested 
friends, collegues, etc. If you want more information, or if you want to 
contribute, please contact us at one of the addresses shown in the 
accompanying information.


Hoping to see you at the conference,


                The PROMPT Committee

                  On graphical interfaces, user groups and PC compatibility

                           Is bigger better in handheld computing?



Dear HP user,

PROMPT - the Dutch user group for all Hewlett-Packard calculators and handheld
computers - is proud to announce the 1994 PROMPT Anniversary Conference.

We celebrate our 10th anniversary in 1994, and we have organized a number of 
activities to celebrate this. One of them was inviting numerous 'famous' HP 
personalities to write a guest article for our journal throughout 1993. 

Another, and perhaps the most important event will be the conference in 1994. 
To take care of organizational matters, we have established a separate 
foundation, HPCALC. After a relative long period of silence since the 1992 
HPCC London conference, we are in a position now to start taking registrations.
For information on how to register, look at the end of this article.

When and where
--------------

The conference will be held at the Galaxy hotel right in the heart of 
Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The conference will be held in the weekend of 
28 and 29 May 1994. 

We have set aside four rooms for the conference: one large one, where the main 
presentations will be held, two smaller rooms for workshops, and one final 
room where clubs and dealers can present themselves. All presentations and 
workshops will be held in the English language.

Main theme
----------

There will be a number of main threads throughout the conference.

-  Calculators and education

   With the advent of more and more powerful calculators, the question arises
   whether these so called 'super calculators' should be allowed for use
   in higher education.

   At the conference, we would like to start a discussion on this topic, looking
   into reasons to forbid (or encourage) their use, and also comparing the rules
   in the different countries around the world.

-  Graphical user interfaces

   Was the introduction of the HP48G and GX models just the beginning in the
   quest for the friendliest user interface? Or, will the fancy forms and menus
   just hamper the serious user? Given the limited computation power present 
   in a handheld, where should the line be drawn? We hope to answer these and
   other questions on this subject at our conference.

-  User groups

   The user groups catering for HP calculators and handhelds seem to go up and
   down in the 'popularity polls'. Were there once many thriving user groups
   all around the world, it seems that a large number of them are no longer
   with us. The last few years, however, new groups are being formed, either on
   a formal or informal basis. Have the still surviving clubs changed? 

   What does the 'perfect' user group look like: regular meetings, glossy maga-
   zines, mail order? Seen in this light, is there a function for the 
   Europe-wide body HEX?

Aside from these threads, there will be a number of workshops, where the more
'practical' sides of using the calculators and handhelds will be shown. 
Currently planned topics include: User and System RPL, Synthetic Programming, 
Use of the Solver, Databases and C programming on the 95/100, etc.

The latest machines from Hewlett-Packard will of course be in the limelight 
most (such as the 48G and GX, 100LX), but don't think there will nothing of 
interest to, say, 41 die-hards! And we never know if there might be some news
to spread during the conference...

Small print
-----------

There should be a registration form with this introduction, or you should be 
able to get it from the same source. Attendance fee for the conference (two 
days) will be f175 (175 guilders, approximately US$ 95, or UKP60) if you 
register before the 31st of january 1994, f200 if registering later. This will
cover entry to the conference, a copy of the proceedings, and coffee, tea and 
lunch on both days. 

There will be farewell diner organized on Sunday, for which you can register 
separately, at f50 per person. You are expected to find your own way on 
Saturday evening (although we can probably organize something for the foreign 
visitors).

The Galaxy hotel
----------------

If you would like to stay the night (or two) at the Galaxy hotel, please tick 
the appropriate box on the registration form. The Galaxy, a luxurious hotel 
right in the heart of Amsterdam, offers a special deal for conference
attendees at f150 guilders per person per night. If this is not within your 
budget, we can provide you with a list of alternatives, and we might be able
to help with reservations.

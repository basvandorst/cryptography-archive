	It should be quite easy to determine which compression scheme
was used given the plaintext and the compressedtext.  The type of
plaintext - text, binary data, image data, voice, etc... - usually
restricts the compression technique to a small class of algorithms.
And like all good cryptographic methods, good compression methods are
known to the professionals - descriptions of these methods are in
textbooks and are discussed widely in magazines and in groups like
comp.compression/comp.compression.research .
	For instance, knowing the plaintext was just text or general
data, Huffman coding or Ziv-Lempel coding, or a derivative of those,
would most likely be used.  The comptext can be analyzed to see if
it fits the characteristics of these coding schemes.  The same goes
for any kind of data: for voice, LPCs; for images, JPEG, DCT, etc...

	Determining the type of compression used on a type of data
should be much easier compared to cryptanalyzing a good cipher.
(And by good cipher we mean Kerckhoff's Principle, naturally).

The most recent results I am aware of is Willi Meier's paper at
Eurocrypt '93.

IDEA is made up of two stages that alternate in the form
ABABABABABABABABA, with 9 A's and 8 B's.

Meier predicts that 2^42 work is needed to break ABAB, 2^106 to
break ABABA, and ABABAB requires full exhaustive search.

This, I have recommended a 4-round IDEA, ABABABABA, to people with
less stringent security requirements.

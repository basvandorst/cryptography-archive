The Vernam cipher (one-time pad) is the only provably secure
cryptosystem from the point-of-view of 'perfect secrecy' of the
ciphertext.  But even Vernam can be broken with social engineering,
black bag jobs, etc.

Who can prove a negative? On the other hand, the person making the
positive assertion that 'the NSA can crack anything' needs to
present some evidence for that case.

And of course the NSA *has* been trying, unsuccessfully, to supress
PGP.  You of course read Prof. Denning's implied endorsement of PGP:

'"PGP," warns Dorothy Denning, a Georgetown University professor who has worked closely with the National Security Agency, "could potentially become a widespread problem.'  -- (E. Dexheimer)

Summary: while we can't prove PGP secure, I *seriously doubt* that anyone
outside the NSA can show that they can break it, either.

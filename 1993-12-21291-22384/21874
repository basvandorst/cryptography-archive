Probably UL.  However (always a however), there are really two types of TEMPEST
(actually, there are more, but I shan't muddy the waters).  TEMPEST certified
means that each and every unit is tested by a designated tester, and samples
are directly tested.  These are designed and built by people who have TEMPEST
clearances and are not only covered under ITARS, but are considered classified. 
TEMPEST rated hardware is stuff which is designed to meet "public" (ie. only
SECRET) specs but not tested.  Samples are typically tested by a designated
tester, but not the whole lot.  I've been told that some of the tests are less
rigorous.  Third (remember, there are two) is TEMPEST qualified (I may have
these last two names twisted), which is nothing more than someone doing the
obvious things to greatly shield the device, in hopes of acting like TEMPEST.

How to spot:

Over priced current technology		TEMPEST qualified
Outrageously priced old technology	TEMPEST rated
Hidiously priced obsolete stuff		TEMPETS certified

I do not know what is so rare about noise diodes.  I ran my MWJPAL (Microwave
Journal) desktop "advisor" and asked for noise diodes.  The following sources
immediately popped up:
	Advanced Semiconductor, Inc.
	MDF Products Inc.
	Microwave Diode Corporation
	Noise Com Inc.
If anyone needs addresses or telephone numbers for these companies, send me
email.  Mark is certainly mistaken in his posting.

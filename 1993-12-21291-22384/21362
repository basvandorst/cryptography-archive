I agree that this is a potential problem, but the fundimental cryptographic
assumptions of Chaum's stuff are really sound.  Even the NSA trusts RSA.

There are poker protocols developed by Goldwasser and Micali that are
immune to the quadratic residue bit leaking problem.

In any case, I think the potential of loss due to human error is fgar
greater than the potential of loss due to cryptanalytic attack.  What
happens now when the bank says that no computer records of your last
deposit?

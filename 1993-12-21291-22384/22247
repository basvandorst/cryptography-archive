No one has attempted differential cryptanalysis because the algorithm is
not fully specified in the documents.  The contents of the S-boxes, which
to a large degree determine the algorithm's resistance to differencial and
linear cryptanalysis, have been left out.

I am less impressed with reports of the algorithm's insecurity.  Assuming
the S-boxes are designed to be resistant to differentian and linear
attacks (a reasonable assumption), then the 32 iteration should make those
attacks infeasible.  I don't expect 2^256 complexity, but I expect that it
willbe a lot more complex than DES.

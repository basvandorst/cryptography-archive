Let us assume, for sake of argument, that for a price, NSA can read
anything encrypted under PGP.  Does that imply that PGP is "unsafe."

The answer is yes, if, and only if, the "price" is below the value of the
"anything" so encrypted.  

Such a reading would be efficient if, and only if, the price was below
the least cost alternative for obtaining the data.  In the section on
"vulnerability" that appears in the documentation of PGP, PZ outlines
a number of vulnerabilities and attacks against PGP that would likely be
cheaper than a cryptanalytic attack.

Courtney's first law says that nothing useful can be said about the
security of any system except in the context of a particular application
and environment.

However, if I can limit those who can read my traffic to only the NSA, I
have increased my security greatly.  It would be difficult to describe
such a mechanism as inherently "unsafe" for no better reason than a
speculation that NSA can read it.

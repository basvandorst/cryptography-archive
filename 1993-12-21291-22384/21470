Whitaker is gain being daft, as the Guardian is a national paper ...

Apart from the copyright problems, it is not particularly interesting for
those watching the net.  I can't see anything about the case against Phil
Zimmermann that hasn't been covered on the net, (eg comp.society.cu-digest).
For accurate details about PGP I recommend reading the documentation files,
(ftp.demon.co.uk /pub/pgp/pgp23doc.zip  - I think).

Wendy Grossman's brief overview of PGP mentions public key servers, and
the use of RSA - leading to a mention of PKP's patent on RSA, US export
regulations, and the investigation of Phil's alleged 'illegal export' of
PGP.  Given that the article is most probably been read by people unfamiliar
with PGP, or public key encryption it would have been nice to see more
explanation of some of these.

The article also suggests that GATT may allow foreign recognition of
prepublished US patents such as the RSA one.  This is the only topic
mentioned that I'm not familiar with, and I would certainly have liked
some explanation.

The 'technical' description of PGP is inaccurate, for example it does not
mention the use of the IDEA algorithim.  There were few directions for
people interested to find out more.  Whether these were due to inaccuracies
in the original article or later editing is hard to judge.

Hmmm, I sound like a mad axeman demolishing the article.  This is not my
intention.  I am dissappointed with the content, nevertheless I am very
pleased to see the subject receive such prominent attention.  I guess it
at least leaves Ms Grossman an opportunity for a followup.  :-)

A new PGP public key server has started operation at Oxford University.
Its email address is:

		pgp-public-keys@pgp.ox.ac.uk

If you don't know how to use a key server, sent email to the above
address with the subject "HELP", and explanatory text will be returned
to you.  The incoming mail queue is processed every 15 minutes, so there
may be a short delay.

If you don't know what PGP is, here's a brief summary.  PGP is a program
available for Unix, VAX/VMS, MS-DOS, Mac, Amiga and doubtless many more,
which uses high-grade public key cryptography to keep your files and
email away from prying eyes.  PGP stands for Pretty Good Privacy.  Not
only does it have strong encryption, it is possible to prevent data from
being tampered with, and to sign it, so that it is clear to anyone
that only the signer could possibly have created that file or email.

Much more detail is available in the PGP package itself, available for
anonymous ftp from black.ox.ac.uk (129.67.1.165).  MS-DOS users should
get /src/security/pgp23A.zip (the source code is in pgp23srcA.zip); Mac
users should get macpgp2.3.cpt.hqx and everyone else pgp23A.tar.Z -- you
will need appropriate decompression / unarchiving software which should
be available on your machine.  Note that all of the above files require
binary transfer mode.

Hi!
	I read the FAQ, but there is one thing that I don't quite
understand about Known Plaintext attacks... 
(ex. I want to crack a letter written by a phriend... and he always starts
his letters out like:

Dear So Andso:

how would I attempt to decode the rest of the letter...
I understand brute force attacks, but how are you going to know the type
of encryption and everything?...

Thanx

Silver (Ag)

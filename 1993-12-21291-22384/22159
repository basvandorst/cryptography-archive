Copyrights, where a binary-compare of the object can be done?  Maybe.

Patents?  Fooey.

Anyone who wants to violate a software patent need only code obscurely.
They need not encrypt their binaries to be absolutely safe from anything
except an examination of their source, and even given the source, I
wouldn't bet on the lawyers getting the right answer.

A software patent cannot practically protect against anything that is not
evident in the external behavior of a program.

One of the stupidest, most ignorant aspects of software patents is that
it is not just hard, but formally impossible to determine if two programs
use the same algorithm.  That follows from the "halting problem,"

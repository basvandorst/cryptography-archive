This is a load of bull which keeps recurring every so often. People,
usually anon's, claim the NSA has planted a trapdoor in the latest version
of PGP so they can decrypt it. The latest claim was that they coerced all
major compiler makers (including GNU/GCC) into planting a trojan in the
compiler which would compile a weakness into PGP. This was based on an
early version of Unix, which had such a trick built into the compiler to
build a trapdoor into login. 2.3a is the latest. It's very stable compared
with the earlier versions.

 I have a thought that is quite possibly covered in a FAQ, but I am going to
 ask anyway.
 
 
 Would'nt just encrypting something twice make it unbreakable?
 
 
Take for instance a ZIP file.  Lets say you encrypt it with a password and
then you run it through PGP with a key.
 
 Is there anyway you could break that?
 
 I have some stuff at work that is very sensitive and I encrypted it with
 a ZIP password and then a Norton Encrypt on top of it.  Besedes being
 very cumbersome, I felt safe with that.
 
 
	Curious,

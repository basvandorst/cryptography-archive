Does anyone know for certain whether or not DES has been recertified?
If so, were any changes made in modes of operation, etc.?  Do you
have a pointer to the Federal Register announcement?

At the March Interop, a NIST representative said that she expected
that DES woudl be recertified.  According to Schneier's book, someone
else from NIST made a stronger statement to Congress.  Has anything
happened since then?

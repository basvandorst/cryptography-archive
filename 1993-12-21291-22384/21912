	Hmm, are you sure it's tempest certified?  Just because it is
shielded does not mean that it is really tempest certified.

	As you point out, the Tempest certification standards are classified;
only specially licenced manufacturers under contract with the government
have access to them.  However, there are many manufactures who produce 
Tempest-like shielded equipment, and even test it for low emissions, but they 
cannot say whether or not it truly tempest-certified becasuse they do not have
access to the standards.

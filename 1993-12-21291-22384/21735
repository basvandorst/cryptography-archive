You are misunderstanding the methodology.  Basicly, you build a compiler  
that has the trap door in it.  Then, you remove the trap door from the  
source code to the compiler.  The compiler always knows when it is  
building a new version of itself.  ie: an earlier version of the compiler  
building a later version.  So, it takes the trapdoor module that is inside  
itself and inserts it into the final executable.  The technique works, as  
long as you continue to build the compiler with older versions of the  
compiler.

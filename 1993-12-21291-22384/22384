 In New Zealand for some strange reason it seems to be okay to play songs
containing words like fuck and cunt but the DJ's arn't allowed to *SAY* them.
Thus I remember we used to get songs on student radio that the DJ's
could play but not read the title of(!).

I've also heard songs on mainstream stations containing the words though
Its more common later at night and on say a heavy metal show.

Songs that Ive heard during early evening -

'Who are you?' - The Who     -  contains 'who the fuck are you?' near end.
'Anarchy in the USA' - Megadeth  - contains 'cunt' though its hard to 
pick up

Student radio on the hand will play stuff like 'friggin in the riggin' by
'The Sex pistols'/'Anthrax' anytime if you get the right DJ and they can 
find it :)

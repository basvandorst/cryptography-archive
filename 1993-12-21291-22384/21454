Weakness in CBC mode

Here's a weakness in CBC mode that I haven't seen mentioned in any text-book.

Consider a large amount of data encrypted using CBC, more than 2^32 blocks.

As a consequence of the Birthday Paradox it is more than likely that two
or more identical blocks of ciphertext will be generated.

Knowing the plaintext associated with one, trivially reveals the Plaintext
associated with the other (Known Plaintext Attack)

I can't remember what was the `real clue,' but, according to my remembrance
of the `Codebreakers,' a very important clue was that the Japanese embassy
was strongly advised to deliver the message at 13.00 on that day.  This
implied that something important was about to happen at that time.  13.00
in Washington would have been dawn at Pearl Harbour, a prime time for a
surprise attack.  A warning message was sent to the commandant at Pearl
Harbour, but got lost in the bureaucracy and was not delivered to him until
that afternoon, long after the attack had occurred.

Im not sure about your system in the states but ill explain ours.

We dont have a constituation or bill or rights...."you have the right to shut
up and do wot your told"

OUr Mobile system is very interesting....

In Australia there are 3 carries with 4 services.

Telecom Australia:  Standard Cellular - Non Secure
Optus:	Standard Cellular (leased of telecom)
	Digital Mobile: dual encrypted
Vodafone: Digital: dual encrypted..

now... i PRESUME you guys in the US and elsewhere have digital mobiles..
Even thou Australias mobile network is known to be proabably the best
in the entire world (no i dont work for the fone company, just contract to
optus a little bit, heheheh)

When Optus first brought the secure Digital network in, the Federal 
Authorities to your equiv of:
U.S of A <-> Australia
----------------------
CIA	  =  ASIO (Aust. Security Intelligence Organization)
FBI	  =  ASIS (Aust. Security Intelligence Service)
	  =  AFP  (Australian Federal Police)
NSA	  =  DSD  (Defence Signals Directorate)
???       =  JIO  (Joint Intelligence Organization)
		-Combined assesment of info by ASIO,ASIS,CIA,MI6,etc....
???	  =  ONA  (Office of National Assessment)
NCSC	  =  ???
SS	  =  Sorta ASIS's area...
(dont quote me on the above....its what i remember from working with some
of them...thou they dispise me now ;)

Now when the mobile digital network came in, there was a mass screaming from
all those Intelligence Services above that they needed to be able to tap the
digital network when they had to......so in the end they all won and 
Parliment passed laws allowing them to use the fone companies equiptment
at its heart to be able to monitor it all...

For all I know, every conversation on my secure digital fone is being recorded
by the Fedz of some type....thou its almost impossible for any NON Federal
agency to be able to tap my fone..... Do I feel secure? Yes and no....
At least Im not going to be liek the politicians of a few years ago who
were massed disgraced by analouge mobile tapping and like what happened
to Charles and Diana thingo....

Just my 2 centz.... I cant even remember what I was doing a followup to..
But im interested in discustions and thought you'd like to know Australias
posiition....

thanx

There's fairly good coverage of everything you're after in an issue of ACM
Computing Surveys of about 10 years ago.  I think it's from 1983, and is
part of a special issue on network security.  I'm not at home at the moment
so I can't quote chapter and verse, but if anyone has trouble finding it, mail
me and I'll look it up when I get home.

I would recommend the paper in question to anyone wanting information on the
modes of operation of block ciphers and other encryption security issues. 

Peter.

I am working on coding some primality testing algorithms.
468305667211 passes them but I can find a so that a^((p-1)/2) mod p
is not 1 (p is 468305667211).  I *think* this means the number in
question is not prime.  True?  (a is 424192645153650583361299 if 
anybody's interested...)  (The alternative of course is that I have
a bug somewhere...)

Hmmm. I think I invented the phrase ``flood cryptosystem'' in April 1992
when I posted an article on the subject. The idea itself is a well known
piece of folklore---just the sort of thing you expect to see a patent on
sometime soon.

I seem to remember Ben-Or telling me that Ueli Maurer's thesis puts this
into a theoretical framework. 'Twas the January 1992 J. Crypt, methinks.

: "The Index of Coincidence and It's Applications in Cryptanalysis" and
: "Elements of Cryptanalysis", both by W. F. Friedman.

: Cryptologia XVII number 1(loved that genetic algorithm article) and
: Cryptologia XVII number 2.

: "Cryptography", by J. Seberry and J. Pieprzyk.

: A copy of "The Cryptogram" of the American Cryptogram Association.

: Cheers.

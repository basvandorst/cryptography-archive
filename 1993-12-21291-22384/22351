The "dual encrypted" actually refers to GSM with (what used to be) A5 
encryption.  There aren't really two levels of encryption, the first is 
simply digitization and compression which is easily reversible.  In 
addition, for GSM to be introduced, "a compromise was worked out" with 
Australian security agencies, which I take to mean that a gradual switch 
to the (very weak) A5X encryption will eventually be made.  If a cellphone 
using A5 tries to use an base station which is only fitted for A5X, a 
transparent drop to an unencrypted (that is, digitized+compressed only) 
transmission is made.  Of course, you don't get any flashing lights or 
sirens when you make the call to tell you that this has happened...

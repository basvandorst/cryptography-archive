Use PGP in conventional encryption mode. It's much more secure than
ARJ or PKZIP and also does compression (comparable to PKZIP 2.0x)
before encrypting.

ARJ's encryption is ridiculously insecure. Can be broken by anybody if
known plaintext is available. PKZIP's encryption is not very strong,
but will stop the occasional attacker, if you use good passwords.

Probably DES. Don't know how secure the implmentation is, but have
been disappointed by what have seen in comparable products (e.g.,
Diskreet). Use PGP. It's free, and comes in source, so you can examine
the security yourself.

If you really mean *digits* (the characters from '0' to '9'), then
breaking any of the above cyphers is trivial, even on a PC. If,
however, you mean actually *characters*, then for ARJ it is trivial,
if you have known plaintext, and for the others in infeasible by brute
force alone.

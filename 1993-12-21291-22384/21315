The answer to this question is not known. Most people who are willing to use  
RSA make two assumptions:

a) breaking RSA is as hard as factoring (your question);
b) factoring is hard.

If either a) or b) is false, then RSA can be broken. On the other hand, if we  
can factor the modulus, we can break RSA, so clearly

a') factoring is as hard as breaking RSA

is true.

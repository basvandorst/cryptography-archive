        There are a couple of sources of remote challenge/response
        calculators that take a user PIN and a challenge string as
        input and return a cryptographically strong hash. They cost
        about $40 each. Matching host software is available for a
        variety of platforms. Very small, very convenient, billions of
        logins required to crack.

        Part of the calculation is secret and unique to the
        individual, serialed calculator. This adds "something you
        have" to "something you know", significantly improving
        authentication confidence.

        If you are considering authentication for general users (as
        opposed to a small group of engineers and scientists) I
        strongly recommend them.
        
        Cheers,
                Marc

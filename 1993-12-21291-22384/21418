Odlyzko's paper is now an "old" paper. You should have a look to the following
paper :

M. J. Coster and A. Joux and B. A. LaMacchia and A. Odlyzko and
C.-P. Schnorr and J. Stern
Improved Low-Density Subset Sum Algorithms
in journal of Computational Complexity 1993.

Joux's phD thesis (Ecole Polytechnique, France, 1993) is talking about lattice
reduction and how to break knapsack systems.

Chor-Rivest's knapsack is not yet broken, up to my knowledge, but Schnorr
may have done some improvement of the previous attacks which able to reach
Chor-Rivest's complexity.

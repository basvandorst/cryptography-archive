Since my previous post I have receive a little more info, the Viacrypt
PGP user's manual apparently says:
"For the RSA Public Key Technology, ViaCrypt PGP incorporates the DigiSig+
(tm) cryptographic engine, which was developed by ViaCrypt under a patent
sublicense from Public Key Partners."

Presumably 'DigiSig+' has been validated to both Viacrypt's and PKP's
satisifaction, making it rather pointless to also test and validate
the implementation used by the regular version of PGP.  It also avoids
endorsing the code used in allegedly patent infringing copies of PGP,
which could be embarrassing to PKP / RSADSI.

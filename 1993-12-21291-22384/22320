   I have heard that Cinncinati-Microwave (Passport/Escort co.) makes a 
   broad-spectrum (for around $400) that broadcasts on several freq's at once.  I 
   dont know much about it.  I have been told, like anything, this can be 
   listened to as well.  That is, if someone really wants to listen to it.

Eavesdropping on spread-spectrum systems is obviously much more work
than simple analog or digital; the real security level depends on how
the codes (for CDMA) or frequency-hopping patterns are picked.
I assume anything mass-market that's exportable has NSA blessing
(e.g. either it's real simple or they've told the NSA how to break it,
as some of the cellular phone makers have had to do.)

AT&T has also announced a spread-spectrum cordless, with a range of
about a mile; I don't remember if it's out yet, whether it's OEMed, etc.
I think the price was in the $400-500 range.  Spread-spectrum makes it
easy to use without interference from other users of the same phone,
and from other 900-MHz equipment, both of which are more significant
problems for a 1-mile range phone than a typical 100-foot range cordless.
For me, a 10-mile phone would be really useful, since I could use it
at home or work; I suppose 1 mile at least lets me go to the post
office and grocery store.

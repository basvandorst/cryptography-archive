I believe the key-server s/w uses PGP to manipulate the keyring.  It should
be possible to write independent routines to do this sort of thing, but I
imagine the author took the easy way out.

Solution would be either independent keyring-manipulation code and/or
buying a copy of ViaCrypt's product and having the key-server talk to a
DOS box (or telling PKP you're running VC on a DOS box...).

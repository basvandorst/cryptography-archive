The basic facts of this story appear in Kahn's "The Codebreakers" and
are well known to crypto buffs, though it's possible that some new
details have come to light.  Thomas Parrish's book "The American
Codebreakers: The US Role in Ultra" has a good primary source
bibliography if I remember correctly.  Purple used rotary telephone
switches and I don't know if much about its operation remains secret
(e.g. you may be able to go to a museum to look at one).  The
Codebreakers and similar books say some things about it, but I don't
remember much.

There is a biography of W.F. Friedman called "The Man Who Broke Purple"
but I haven't gotten around to reading it yet.  I expect it would
say quite a lot about the Purple story.

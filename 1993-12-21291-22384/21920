Or run PGP on a PC doing VT100 emulation :)

Really evil people could have put bad things into the system software
at sometime in the past... so, if you trust the release tapes/disks,
you should re-gen the entire system from scratch :(

And make sure any application processes that run with privleges are
free from nasty side effects... not an easy job.

There is a Kerberos newsgroup...but those folks use DES :(

I don't think so.  Although one might argue that such rules should not be
laws but should merely be the social etiquette which people naturally obey
(as works pretty well on USENET) it's much harder to filter out obnoxious
people transmitting radio (without losing use of the frequency alltogether)
than to filter obnoxious posters.

Imagine that people were to start sending each other large encrypted files
on USENET.  It would certainly be an effective way of hiding the intended
recipient of a file (only someone with the encryption key would know the
file was for him).  If everyone did that, however, the net would become
almost totally useless--the only way it could remain useful would be for
people to stop propagating these rediculous bandwidth wasters.

I see there as being a similar argument in place for Ham radio.  If there
weren't laws to prevent it, the entire useable bandwidth would probably be
clogged to the point of uselessness.

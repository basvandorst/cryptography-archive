	Back when I was a kiddie, I had a talk with a guy who apparently
	was trying to with the upcoming Navy bid for Tempest PCs (8088 ones!).
	Anyway, one of the other things he mentioned was that they were
	looking into special keyboards because, and he may have been pulling
	my leg, as the keys are used they wear differently, and thus their
	acoustics chance, and by using the sound of the spacebar (distinctive),
	they could map out the rest of the sounds from they keyboard, making
	a cheapie audio mike plenty to spy on a workstation used to input
	sensitive data.

	Thinking about it now, it sounds completely ridiculous.  But then,
	so does the idea of a Tempested plotter.  ("Hey, they're drawing . . 
	. .. Hmm, Ah, sensitive plans for the .. Ah, I see! NCC1701!  Ha!
	Wait until my comrades see this!")

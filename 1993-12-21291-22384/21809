I know of at least one, the Z5J.  I couldn't get it over here (NZ isn't
exactly a large market for these things), so I just used a BZY88 zener
instead, it just has less output than the Z5J.  Would any UK person like to
see if the Z5J is still available over there?  I think it was made by some
company there, but I can't remember who....

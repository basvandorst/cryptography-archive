No, the fifst use of digital phone was the Telecom trial in Brisbane
in March 93. It lasted 2 weeks of the 6 months planned.

I did not hear of screams from our spooks, the the Poms, in the form of
GCHQ screamed blue bloody murder about it.

Not mind you that I don't think there where screams, just that we did hear
much of them.

The Australian "Telecomunications Act" outlaws "any code, cypher or secret
writing, other that the common commercail code"

So TC had this minor legal problem... Well two actualy. When GSM was licenced,
the deal was done prior to the ISO standard being promulgated, so the EEC
standard was the one in the contracts. The significant difference is that
the EEC standard mandated the use of the MD5 cypher _at all times_. Also
equipment had been ordered, installed shipped etc with MD5 in place.

So the was a sudden termination of the GSM trail...

Things have now been 'fixed' some how. GSM is alive and kicking the
shit out of hearing-aids, and other electronics. I have not yet asked
what changes have been made, but I expect there will be some special
case provision like in the case of bank ATMs.

More next year ;-) ( when the AUSTEL office opens )

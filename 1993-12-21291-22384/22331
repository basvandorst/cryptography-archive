All this talk about how hard it is to evesdrop on a spread spectrum
and/or digitally encoded cordless phone (implying that much expensive
equipment would be needed for decoding such a message) seems to 
overlook one obvious fact:  that these companies are selling the
2-way encoded/decoder pairs at ~$400 -- and making a *profit* doing so.
In short, you can buy the code machine leaving you only the problem
of inserting the proper key into it.  Given that these system are mass
produced, key insertion must be a somewhat simple process.  It is
hard to believe that any such system would be overly secure to any
determined attack, and I hope our government is using something more
secure than this for transmitting anything that might hurt the country
overall if it fell into enemy hands.

Just my $.02.

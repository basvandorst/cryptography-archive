Hello,

how difficult is it, to solve the congruence

   x^2 = ay^2 + by + c

modulo a composite number n with unknown factorization? The numbers
a,b and c are given, x and y are unknown.

Is this problem known to be as hard as factoring n or can it be done
in polynomial time (how?) or is this unknown?

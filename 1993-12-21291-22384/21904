    The system in "Clear and Present Danger" used floppy disks not
CD-ROMs.  Is that what you were thinking of?

    Not some, all.  Read David Kahn's Codebreakers for a good account.
The problem was that the message was NOT a declaration of war.  The
Japanese wanted to send a message which broke off relations--without
officially declaring war--to be delivered a few minutes before the
attack on Pearl Harbor.  They failed miserably.  The real clue that an
attack was planned was the separate message telling the embassy to
destroy all code books and equipment.

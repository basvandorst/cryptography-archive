I went through all kinds of hell (blue, green, fuschia, etc...) trying
to get them to answer my questions.  The Tropex tech support people
were extremely unhelpful.

exmplaes:

q:what's digital about this phone?
a:the circuitry?

q: is the comunication digital?
a: yes.

q: you mean, the handset is sampling my voice, sending 0's and 1's to
the base, which then turns it back into analog to send out over the
phone line?
a: it's a digital phone

q: what does that mean?
a: you know, it's digital

q: okay, it says in the ad that it's encrypted.  what exactly does
that mean?
a: it means we use [gives a definition of encryption]

q: is thje phone number i dial encrypted?
a: yes

q: is the phone conversation?
a: yes

q: how?  what alogirthm is used for encryption?  Are you just sampling
my voice and xor'ing it with some key?
a: something like that

q: you're telling my that for less than $200, i get a phone which can
convert analog to digital, digital to analog in both the base and the
handset, and encrypt the bitstream, all in real time?
a: well, our methods are propreitary, I can't really give you any information

q: well, is it sampling my voice or what?
a: we use digital signals and encryption

you get the idea.  I have no idea what this phone does (is it simply
using scrambling).  The frquency range it uses will affect the
fidelity, but that doesn't put us any closer to figuring out what it
means by "encryption."  I'm sure it's a great sounding phone, but I'm
not sure where it gets its claims of security -- claims which are
fairly substantial, at least from the one ad. I saw.

anyone else know?

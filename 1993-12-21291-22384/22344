Digital cellular is supposed to be out Real Soon Now, but I don't know
if it's actually deployed anywhere in the US yet.  The simpler approach to
encryption that a cellphone system can use is to encrypt the air link
of the conversations, but always decrypt at the cell site.  This makes
it easy to interface with non-cellular phones, and makes it easy to
tap as long as the Phone Company lets you into the cell site to do it,
or provides you a remote access to the site for tapping.

An alternative approach, which lets the cell site use a smaller amount
of more complex equipment, is to only decrypt the calls when the call
is going outside the site, but leave the call encrypted if it's going
to another phone at the same cell.  This saves you the cost of two
encryption/decryption circuits on the call (which should be cheap DSPs),
at the cost of some switching equipment (which maybe more expensive)
and call control logic (call control software is always expensive.)
I don't know if anybody does this?

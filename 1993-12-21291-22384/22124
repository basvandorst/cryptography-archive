   I don't think so.  I believe the concept behind S/Key is that there
   are NO secrets known to the host (or transmitted over the network).

There's another problem - even if you *had* a shared secret, it
wouldn't stay secret for long, because the next time you log on,
you're transmitting that password across the net, so the eavesdropper
can use it to decrypt the previous conversation.  On the other hand,
it may be good enough to use for authenticating a Diffie-Hellman exchange,
if you play with the details carefully enough; maybe something like
using two rounds of the password each time - password[N] logs you in,
you XOR your DH half-password with password[N+1], set up your session,
then send password[N+1] to the host to authenticate.  This still lets
the eavesdropper tamper with half the exchange, but it may be useful.

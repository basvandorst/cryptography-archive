Why not have the user have an equation, like Ax+By.... with about 10
terms.  That way, the machine spits out values for x, y, z, etc. and the
user calculates the result (should be easy if he has a calculator, or some
scratch paper)  The coeffs. could spell out something by using the numbers
of the alphabet :) Then the hacker would have to see n passwords where n
is the number of terms to find out the actual equation.  If the user had a
simple programmable calculator, he could write a program to do the
calculations.  He would just enter the numbers the machine gave him and
enter the number that his calc. gave him.

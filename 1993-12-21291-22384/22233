It's only interoperable in one direction: RIPEM Mac is able to use AOCE 
certificates, but not vice versa.

The certificate you can get by emailing to RSA is called a "persona 
certificate," and is associated only with a particular email address.  It is 
signed by the RSA Low Assurance Certification Authority, and does not imply a 
very strong assurance of identity.

AOCE certificates are signed by the RSA Commercial Certification Authority, 
and contain name and address information, as well as a reasonable assurance 
that you are indeed who you claim you are (thus the requirement for 
notarization).

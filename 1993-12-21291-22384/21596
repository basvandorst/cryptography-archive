I believe it is more practical and usual to construct hardware RNJs
based on the quantum noise from a noise diode which is designed for just
this purpose. The signal is amplified and fed into an edge-triggered
flip-flop to remove possible 1/0 bias. The output of the flip-flop is
sampled at regular intervals and stored in a buffer. Or something like
that. Note that it is very important to shield the analog signal from
possible EM interference of a non-random nature.

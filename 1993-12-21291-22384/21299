Getting these things isn't so easy after all:  The NIST ftp site,
csrc.ncsl.nist.gov, only has a single FIPS pub, 171, which isn't much use.  As
for the phone numbers, I tried the freebies first, so initially I called NIST
itself at 301-975-2816. They redirected me to NTIS (I guess they're all going
to FLA's from TLA's now). Then I tried some mysterious organization at
410-766-8729 which someone suggested, but they redirected me to a slightly
different number at NIST.  In the end I gave in and called NTIS on
703-487-4650, and ended up being dumped into an interminable voicemail system.
At about $3/minute I decided I didn't really want to sit there listening to
"Press 1 to continue, 2 to initiate global thermonuclear warfare, 3 to return
to this message", so I've left it for now.  In case anyone's interested, the
full contact details are:
 
     National Technical Information Service
     U.S. Department of Commerce
     5285 Port Royal Road
     Springfield, VA 22161
     Telephone (703) 487-4650, FTS: 737-4650
 
Thanks to everyone who responded, I might retry NTIS at some point (or fax them,
I'm sure they won't have a voicemail system on that line :-).

Here an easy example of a collision-free Hash-Function that is clearly not
one-way:

  Let h: A^* -> A any collision-free Hash-Function (may be one-way or not).
  Then the Function
 
    h': A^* -> {0,1}*A 	with h'(x) = (0,x)    if x in A
			and  h'(x) = (1,h(x)) else

  is collision-free too (proof left as example).

  But for any randomly chosen hash-output O in {0,1}*A we have a 
  50% probability that it is trivial, to find a "fitting" hash-input
  I with h'(I)=O.

	Aside from the fact that Senor Alvarez Machain might dispute
	the fact that anyone is ever "beyond the reach of the U.S.
	government" I think that this person might also want to
	be beyond the reach of the French government.  It is my 
	understanding that the French government has laws against private
	citizens using cryptography.  I wonder if the french government is
	happy about the book's publication in France?

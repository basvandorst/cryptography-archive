Sorry guys if I repeat myself. I am not even in the USA and already got my
copy and already read through chapter 4 !!!! I got mine mail order from
Quantum Books in Cambridge Mass. Nice and clean! E-mail them at
quanbook@world.std.com . Give 'em those little nice numbers you have on that
plastic card in your wallet and they'll ship you a book!

Can life get any easier?

P.S. Not connected with quantum books. Just an happy customer!

That weakness in CBC - perhaps I should have explained:-

Suppose two identical blocks of Ciphertext are detected, at blocks i and j.
Then

P(i) = Dk[C(i)] xor C(i-1)

P(j) = Dk[C(j)] xor C(j-1)

These equations define decryption in CBC mode. Now if C(i)=C(j), then
Dk[C(i)]=Dk[C(j)] (where Dk[] means decryption under the key k)

Therefore due to the proerties of the xor function, we have

P(j) = P(i) xor C(i-1) xor C(j-1)

Knowing P(i) reveals P(j).

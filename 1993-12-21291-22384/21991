Almost. :-) A few corrections:

1) It was not encrypted with the newest version of PKZIP (2.04g), but
with version 1.1. In fact, it was not even compressed; it was stored.

2) They claimed that the password is no longer than 7 characters, not
8.

3) Several people, including myself (not just a single person)
participated a voluntary effort to break the encryption using only
brute-force (well, almost; a few hints from the time the archive was
created were also used), and using many workstations.

4) We demonstrated that the password is longer than 6 characters
(i.e., we did not exchaust the full 7-character keyspace).

Vesselin

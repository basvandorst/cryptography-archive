That line has been in the PGP docs since version 1.0.  At that time, 1.10 
was the current version of PKZIP, so the PGP docs might be referring to 
that version of PKZIP.  1.10 used a notoriously weak encryption method, 
and there were a few programs floating around the net that could break 
open zip files that had been encrypted with that version of PKZIP.

I haven't heard of a program, commerical or otherwise, that runs on a PC 
and can break into a general encrypted zip archive (i.e., one that has a 
good password).  If you know of one, I'd be interested in hearing about it.

I was waiting for this correction! Yet: if one is too lazy to state additional conditions, following definition holds for primes *and* Carmichael numbers: 

a^n = a mod n for all a ( no restriction).

But then you have to keep in mind that Carmichael numbers are *not* prime, so special things happen when 0<gcd(base, N)<N.

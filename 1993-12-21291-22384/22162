 Soon after I posted my original message about some of the things I did to
protect my files at work, the company cracked down on unauthorized use of
the PC's.
 
 They posted a message on every computer warning you that you will lose your
job if they find you typing one key that is not work related.
 
 Whew.  Good thing I encrypted Wolfenstien before they figured out what I was
doing on graveyards.

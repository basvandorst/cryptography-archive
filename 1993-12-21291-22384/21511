One of the features of the program would be the ability to "roll your own"
pad files/diskettes.  Most of the newer Macs have sound input capabilites
built in, so, as has been suggested here, that might be a good source
for random data.   When the program generates the pad files, it would
perform the appropriate tests for randomness on that file before
approving it.

This isn't *really* cryptograhy at its finest, but this is the best
place I could think of to ask this, soo:


At work, I need to extract a lot of information from some .FH3 files.
Like locate several hundred points.  I'd rather not do this by hand,
since I may have to do this again in the future...

So I've started looking at the .FH3 file format.  Of course, it's proprietary,
and the folks at Aldus were shocked when I asked them for a bit of information
about it.

I thought it would be a really simple format.  However, there are a lot of
bizarre things about the way it stores data.  To store a line segment, it 
doesn't just store the locations of the two endpoints (as I would) -- it 
stores those locations three times each.  Why?  It seems to be storing them
as a general curved path, where each "vertex" has three points: the physical
point and two points which represent tangent lines to the curve at that
vertex (using Bezier curves, I'm told).

So I was hoping someone out there had already looked at this format, and
had decyphered it.  If so, could you post/email to me a description of this?
(probably email, since others may not be interested).

Thanks in advance --

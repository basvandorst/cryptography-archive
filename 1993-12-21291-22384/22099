There's no point in trying to compress encrypted data!  With a good encryption
algorithm, such as IDEA, encrypted data look more or less like random numbers,
without any recurring pattern useful for data compression. Therefore,
doublespace will not be able to compress encrypted data files at all!  Why
not instead store them on an uncompressed drive?  They won't take up any more
space there than on the doublespace drive....

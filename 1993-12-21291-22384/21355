   Well, OK.  In the Riddle Game Bilbo Baggins played with Gollum, as soon as
   Gollum started trying to answer Bilbo's question he in effect accepted the
   challenge and acknowledged that it was fair.  What does Computer Shopper
   have in its nassty little pocketses?  We don't know how close the new
   algorithm is to the old one, which gave more superficially random-looking
   distributions before it was fixed.

I take the view that if you accept the challenge, like Gollum, then it
is fair.  If you don't accept the challenge, what does it matter whether
it is fair or not?

I believe it's fair 8-)

Obcrypt:

I looked for periodicities in the two files.  First, I looked for
coincidences between shifted versions of each file.  There was nothing I
regarded as significant, though SECRT2 shifted 31 characters had a
higher than average count.  The next phase was to look not for exact
matches between characters in the shifted texts, but coincidences
between high-frequency characters.  That is, I shifted the file by a
small number of places, and looked for one of " etaoins" in each of the
corresponfing positions.  Again, there was nothing found other than the
31 shift in the second file.

I was looking for evidence that the algorithm used a fix-length key of
around 20 characters.  The value 20 is taken from previous work which
shows that about 1/20 of the "random" values are zero.  I found no
evidence that convinced me.  I believe the rng is the source of the
excess zeros, not a constant pass phrase.

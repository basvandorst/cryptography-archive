I am a 46 year old second generation computer type (My dad's first
computers had TUBES! (Valves to you Brits :) and I have seen lots of
speculation on what was going to happen in the future and I have seen
what amounted to the future.  An observation:

Speculation as to what will happen 5-10 years out is 30-50% right... just
look at what the smart leading edge folks are doing today and project.

Speculation as to what will happen 10-20 years out is about 10% right...
"Who would even want a computer in their home??" - author to a member
of the HP Homebrew Computer Club in the early 70s :)

Specualtion as to what will happen 20-30 years out is 99% wrong...
remember Asimov's Multivac? :)

Normally one would expect innovation to slow down in a maturing industry...
but it looks to me like networking and it's consequences is still relatively
new.  So, who knows?

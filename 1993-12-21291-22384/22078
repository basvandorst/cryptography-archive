What would seem really useful would be a long dictionary of English words,
sorted according to frequency of usage.  That way, you could take a
dictionary containing 128K words, for example, and easily create a smaller
dictionary containing the "n" most commonly used words, and "n" could be a
convenient power of two.

Does such an item exist, or has it been considered?

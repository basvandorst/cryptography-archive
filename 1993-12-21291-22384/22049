This post has caused a lot of requests for the program. Thanks.
I won't be able to distribute easily after 12/31/93 because my
Vax account is getting killed. If anyone has a better idea for
distribution, let me know. It may be put up on ripem.msu.edu,
but access there is a pain.

Well, it uses IDEA-CFB. I checked the IDEA against that in PGP and it
produces the same output. The IV's are generated by taking the track
and sector and head, putting them in a block, and pre-encrypting that
block. The resulting pseudo-random block serves as the IV. The key
is generated with an MD5 hash of the passphrase, and there is an XOR
with 0x0DAE of the expanded key. I was told this would eliminate
weak keys.

I've never tried, due to the risk of export trouble.

I need a better way to distribute. Ideas?

Secure Drive slows down disk access considerably. Keep C: big enough
for everything that doesn't need encrypting, and only put the sensitive
stuff on the encrypted drive.

A safety precaution, to avoid interactions. It turns off the TSR
when you go to encrypt a floppy.

The purpose of the /s option is to allow you to use the machine without
logging in the secure drive. I'd put the first two lines into the
autoexec, and put the other two in something like gosecure.bat so
you can choose not to login.

The encryption slows everything down. That's why you're wise to put only
sensitive data on the secure drive.

Thanks for posting this info. I think I'll add it to my help file, if
that's okay with you. Plenty of people have asked me about dblspace or
stacker, and I have to say I don't know because I'm using DOS 5.

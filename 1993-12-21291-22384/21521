Ah, if life were only that simple.  To analyze what a "spook" says, you need
to think like a "spook" and analyze what would motivate you, in that role,
to take those actions or say those things.

Let's say, for example, that the NSA says (hypothetically) "PGP is a threat
to the security of the free world and should be banned".  If they did, you'd
have to analyze *WHY* they would say something like that.  There are two
contradictory possibilities:

1.)  They are genuinely concerned and want to stop it at all costs.

2.)  They already know how to crack it, but they want people to think it's
     "unbreakable" and thus entrust sensitive info to it, rather than seeking
     even more secure alternatives.

Maybe neither is 100% true, but they think they have a chance of exploiting
weaknesses in the near future.  At any rate, what's the point of trying to
"suppress" something thats already "out of the bag"?  OTOH, attempts at
suppression could give the impression that they're "scared" of it, leading
people to casually use it with a false sense of security.

BTW, I don't necessarily think any of the three possibiliies I mentioned is
true, but it's food for thought.  What if, OTOH, the American government
DIDN'T make any attempt to restrict the usage and distribution of PGP?  That
might lead people to believe that PGP/RSA/IDEA had been broken and lead to
the development of something even more troublesome to them.  So, even if PGP
can't be broken right now, such might be possible in the future.  Any
successor to PGP might be an order or two of magnitude more secure, so
delaying that would be even more important, from a SIGINT point of view.

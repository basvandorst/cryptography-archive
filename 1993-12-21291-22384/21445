I used the first lines of the DES S-box tables.  They'll do for a first
crack.  I merged them into 256-entry byte tables for speed.

The GOST has much slower avalanche than the DES, so it will take some
care to see if it has any strength, good tables or not.  (Of course,
twice as many rounds doesn't hurt.)

Initial conjecture: key words with lots of ones increase avalanchine
(by carries) and are thus stronger.  I *very* much doubt the work to
break this cipher is anywhere near 2^256.  Some constraints on key
choices may be beneficial.

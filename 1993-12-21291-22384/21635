   * boards like this should have minimal effect on the security of RSA:
   directly factoring a 1024-bit number (300+ decimal digits) remains
   intractable by known methods...the current status is, I believe, a
   129-digit number (just one of them, of course) which was factored in
   about a year of work by hundreds of workstations ganged together. A
   speedup of 1000, or even a million, in each of these workstations
   would only push the reachable limit to something in the 140-digit
   range. 300-digit numbers remain safe.

The current record for a general purpose factoring algorithm which has
completed its run is 120-digits, which took 800-odd MIPS-years.  The
work was performed by a 16k-processor MasPar and a number of
workstations.  The 129-digit number you refer to is only partly
completed.  I'm one of the RSA-129 project organizers; if you would like
to join in you'll need a Unix box with over 8Mb of physical memory.
Contact rsa129-info@iastate.edu for more information.

At any one time, the RSA-129 project has hundreds of workstations,
several MasPars and dozens of PC's running Linux or 386BSD.  The
occasional supercomputer drops by every now and again -- a couple of
Cray's have joined in, for instance.

We have already accumulated well over a MIPS-millenium; we are going to
require a few more yet before we are finished.  Note that this
corresponds to around 10^17 machine instructions.  The accumulated time
already well exceeds any other single computation of which I am aware.

Several folks were kind enough to clue me in on Carmichael numbers as a 
problem for RSA.  If I understand them rightly, a Carmichael number for 
either p or q means the RSA modulus may be factorable (horrors!).

So, what are the bounds of this problem?  Apparently there are infinitely 
many Carmichael numbers.  Yet, it seems to me that there are less 
Carmichael numbers within any given range than primes.  If I'm right, 
then perhaps the probability of haplessly hitting on a Carmichael number 
instead of a prime is acceptably small?

Assuming a random method for choosing a prime, what's my odds of getting 
a Carmichael number instead?

One of the important presumptions in most cryptographic applications is
that the method of encryption is public knowledge and only the key is
secret.  An alternative way of looking at this is to say that your
security should not be compromised simply by having the secret method
become public knowledge.  Your security should be in the cryuptographic
key.  As for the remaining part of the question, it would be best to
look at any basic cryptography text.

Summary: RUMOUR: RSA has been broken! Comments please!
Keywords: rsa public key encryption broken cryptography

Dear Cryptos,

The following posting appeared in comp.lang.ada. It could be a hoax,
or it could be really big news. I've run it past a fairly heavy
researcher in cryptography and he said that he tried this attack
himself, couldn't get it to work, but finds it perfectly plausible
that it could work. He hinted that the paper abstract below had the
ring of truth to it. That's why I'm posting it.

# William H Payne originally discovered how to break RSA without factoring
# by using powers of two on 10/15/90.
#
# Mr Payne wrote a draft paper "Public Key Cryptography is Easy to
# Break" on 10/16/90.  The abstract (draft only) appears below:
#
#   Public key, also known as Rivest, Shamir, and Adelman,
#   cryptography is broken without factoring the modulus m.
#   The product of the encryption and the decryption exponent is
#   computed directly with order log(base 2) m shifts, adds, and compares.
#   A continued product between the modulus and its multiplier which
#   matches a criterion solves the Fermat-Euler theorems simply for
#   even very large moduli.
#
# Mr Payne is writing a tutorial paper on the same subject with Jon
# Grant which should propose a new public encryption algorithm as
# a standard which can not be easily broken.
#
# This indirectly relates to Ada in that projects in the process of
# implementing public key encryption in Ada may find these advances
# of value.
#
# This information also calls into the question the validity of
# patent claims for RSA.

I emailed Colin James to ask for more information. His reply included
the following statement:

# Bill Payne's 1990 draft paper was just that, a draft paper.
# It is not available for distribution.
#
# Details of the tutorial paper by Bill Payne and Jon Grant are
# forthcoming when the paper is ready.  If a version is appropriate
# for Internet posting, then that would be done as soon as possible.
#
# Bill Payne does not want publicity now;  I had his permission to
# divulge this much so that those implementing RSA or public key
# would not waste their time or resources.

He also said he was happy for me to post all this to sci.crypt. So I'm
posting to propagate this potentially big news and to solicit the
opinions of all those sci.cryptos out there. Should we hold our
breaths for this paper, or does this all sound bogus?

I should add that should this rumour turn out to be true, it does not
mean the end of public key cryptography, just the end of RSA - one of
its strongest algorithms. My crypto rearcher friend advises me that
there are an infinite number of public key algorithms out there.

PS: It's my understanding that PGP uses RSA or a variant of RSA. So if
this rumour is true, it looks as if the NSA can read PGP mail after
all :-) :-) :-) (but let's wait for the paper before going berzerk
OK?)

PPS: Wild conjecture: Perhaps this result (possibly available to many
people-in-the-know in 1990) has something to do with the rather
strange decision of NIST/PKP to avoid RSA for the DSS.

PPPS: If this rumour is true, it's probably a good thing that RSA has
been broken now, rather than later, when it's fully deployed in every
credit card and missile silo.

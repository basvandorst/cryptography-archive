Well, being the earnest little fellow that I am, I went and checked all 17576
3-letter keys.  I'm sorry to say that the name SADAT came up only once in the
plaintext.  Here's the output from the program I wrote -- greatly edited!

Search #  Ciphertext          Key   Plaintext
=====================================================
[deleted, thank God]
....
0015520   GSCWTCGBVDECVUCUE   WYX   DRATSADATADASTARD
=====================================================

I can't speak as to the real likelihood of a coherent English palindrome
happening to appear with the name SADAT in it from the ciphertext you
supplied, but it looks to be quite likely that these `Arab extremist' aren't
all that ... erm ... extreme!

It's actually a clever little Joycean palindrome at that!  :)


Just a hobbyist.

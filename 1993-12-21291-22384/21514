	If true, this would imply that the three numbers

		6n + 1, 12n + 1, 18n + 1

can simultaneously be prime for only finitely many n.  
Heuristicly, we expect O(N/(log N)^3) such values of n below
a given bound N (just as we expect O(N/(log N)^2) pairs of
twin primes below N, where both n - 1 and n + 1 are simultaneously prime).
What is Ribenboim's source?

   PCTools by Central Point has a password-based encryption feature.  If
   you try to decrypt with a different password it tells you right away
   (not after a decrypt/checksum exercise).  But the manual sez that CP
   can't help you if you forget your password.

   I think this BS. How can they know if your password is wrong but not
   be able to extract the right one?

I don't know exactly how its done here, but it is possible to generate
some set of "known plaintext", so that you encrypt (or decrypt) this
small subset of the message in the pass phrase you give, and then
compare.  If the known plaintext matches, then your pass phrase was
probably good.

This begs the questions of does that plaintext help an attacker.  The
answer to this question is, if it does, then the encryption scheme was
not secure to start with, in which case it really doesn't matter, does
it?

Hope this helps.

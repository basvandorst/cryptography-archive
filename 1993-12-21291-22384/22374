This sounds extremely bogus.  If Payne can compute the product
st where s is the the public exponent and t is the secret one,
then he can compute t right away by dividing st by s, and
there is a well known probabalistic algorithm for factoring the
modulus given s and t.  See N. Koblitz, A Course in Number Theory
and Cryptography, for details.  So Payne's method would immediately
give rise to a general factoring algorithm, one of the holy grails
of computational number theory.

Besides, he did this work in 1990, intends to publish, but hasn't yet?
And his abstract is written in the fractured English of a lot of
mathematical cranks.  I'd like to see RSA broken too but I don't think
this is it.

EMP is the LEAST of your problems at Ground Zero.

You can be sure that everything on Spook Corridor was 'well-covered' on
the target lists of the "Other Side."

There's another way to buy Tempest protection from non-certified
systems -- standoff distance. At least parts of one of the DOE National
Labs I visited had a blanket exemption, as folks could not get to within
a mile of that building without a good reason, and/or an escort.

(This was from the thread called "PCTools Encryption Flaw?")

A few people expressed interest in exactly which books and magazines
interested U.S. Customs when I came back from Europe a few months
ago.

Here they are (the books, not the people who were interested):

"The Index of Coincidence and It's Applications in Cryptanalysis" and
"Elements of Cryptanalysis", both by W. F. Friedman.

Cryptologia XVII number 1(loved that genetic algorithm article) and
Cryptologia XVII number 2.

"Cryptography", by J. Seberry and J. Pieprzyk.

A copy of "The Cryptogram" of the American Cryptogram Association.

Cheers.

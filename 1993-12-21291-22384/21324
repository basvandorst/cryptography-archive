True. But you CAN build some level of protection in the larger SYSTEM
that uses the cryptosystem. Post-Walker, NSA made a number of changes
in key distributation methods. For example, put the material in a
special sealed container. Said container cannot be reloaded with the
keymat. Then build the reader on the cryptosystem hardware such that it
directly reads the keymat AND it's smart enough to recognise the
keymat's container...

Of course, your best protection is Two Man Integrity. It may be
possible to subvert one party, but is much harder to get two,
and then to have both in the needed jobs to be partners...

DES itself has been carefully crafted to be no more vunerable to the
attacks you mention than to brute force keysearch, despite the
vunerabilities of similar cyphers.  A brute force keysearch is not
practical without specialised hardware that hasn't yet been fabricated
on the open market, though it's known to be practical.  With a million
dollars, you could build a machine to crack it in about 3.5 hours, but
that doesn't mean you could do it in 350 hours with $10,000 because
there's specialised hardware involved.

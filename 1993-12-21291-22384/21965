	For real security, PKA may often be less practical than simple
OTP systems like S/key. To use PKA you need fairly hefty computes sitting
around; to use OTP systems like S/key you need a pad of paper.

	To safely use a PKA you need some kind of smart card and reader
that can generate a digital signature without the user's private key
ever being available to the client processor. Otherwise you run the risk
of using a client system that has had its remote login client application
wiretapped. The requirement for a smart card or calculator for the PKA
is also a matter of convenience, since I hate the idea of typing in a
1024 digit number correctly each time I want to log in to my machine...

	If you take the approach that the PKA is going to be on a
smart card or a PC/PDA, then I'm not sure how that's much different
from SecurID or Digital Pathways or Enigma Logics or any of the other
"authentication boxes" that are out there. They're very secure, and
use inexpensive non-proprietary algorithms.

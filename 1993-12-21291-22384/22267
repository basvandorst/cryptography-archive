I've noticed the download and actually your program IS in my crypto
dir (ftp@ghost.dsi.unimi.it:/pub/crypt) but it is NOT readable.
I'm wondering what trouble would it be to make it readable.

Since you didn't broke the law by exporting it what's the point with it?
You are NOT responsible if someone else makes you program available
outside the US; once your program has been illegally exported I believe
that it's completely legal for a non-US citizen to make it available
to the world.

Ciao,
David

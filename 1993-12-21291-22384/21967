You're not gonna find anything else on the net for free.   Pkwares
had a contest a while back offering a ($1000) to anyone who could
crack the password of their newest version of PKZip.  They distributed
an encrypted zip file that they claimed had a key made up of 8 or less
ascii characters.   The last I heard of this was someone who said that
they had tried all the keys 7 chars or less and determined that none
were the password.   The proposition of trying all the 8 character
combinations was too great for the person to handle.

There is a software company that produces a commercial pkzip cracker.
I do not know if it uses the same type of brute force attacks as
Pk-Crack or some other method.    I'm sorry I can't remember the name
of the company off the top of my head right now, but it was posted
here a while ago.    More than likely the program doesn't include
source, but I don't even no for sure if this is the case.

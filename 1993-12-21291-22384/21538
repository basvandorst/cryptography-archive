Regarding the technical illegality of using RSA in the US:

The United States Supreme Court has consistently ruled not to uphold
patents on computer algorithms apart from any specific application.
Computer algorithms in the abstract have been viewed as being similar
to mathematical theorems or thought processes, which are not patentable.
It seems to me that the case could be made that application of RSA to
encryption of data in general does not constitute a specific application
and hence ought not to be patented.

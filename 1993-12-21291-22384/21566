In this case, the person who has obtained your secret keyring (but not
the passphrase) is not able to obtain your secret key, unless they are
able to break IDEA (in which case the whole issue of obtaining your
secret key becomes almost pointless, because they would be able to
decrypt your messages even without it). The public keyring is
encrypted with the IDEA cypher, using your passphrase as a key (the
MD5 hash of it, more exactly). Unless your passphrase is sloppy and
can be guessed or obtained in some other way, your secret key is still
reasonably secure.

Depends on what you mean by "disclosed". Just obtaining a copy of the
file containing the keyring is not enough to obtain the secret key.
You need also the passphrase, in order to decrypt it.

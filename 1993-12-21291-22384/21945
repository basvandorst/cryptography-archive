In such a situation it would probably be much easier to just take
over the session.  Note the sequence numbers going by, send a RST
to the remote and take over where the other guy left off (ie. 
already authenticated).  You will have to keep using the address
of the original connection of course and keep the remote's 
FIN's and/or RST's from coming along.

I don't know about "deserves", but it would certainly be reasonal to EXPECT
it, if the data has enough POTENTIAL value to warrant the expense and effort
of an attack.  Your "automated site backups" scenario differs in a couple of
critical ways.  First of all, I'm assuming the 4 gig. figure referred to
discrete, individual TRANSMISSIONS over a period of time, not a single
operation such as a backup.  Second, a backup of that size is not likely to
be TRANSMITTED anywhere, at least by electronic means, where it could be
easily intercepted.  A crypto attack would require that the media first be
physically stolen.

I question the need for encrypted backups, anyway.  With DoD classified
material, the preferred method of safeguarding is with PHYSICAL security of
unencrypted media.  With some of the high speed DAT backup devices in use
today, I question whether any reasonably secure crypto method could keep up
with the data transfer rate.  Also, many large volume backups are
compressed, which would nake a crypto attack much more difficult.

If encryption of such a large volume of data is actually warranted, and a
crypto attack is of concern, there's nothing to prevent the sys admin from
segmenting the backup operation and using different keys on each segment.

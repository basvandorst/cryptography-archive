     Because, my good Englishman, here in America, what one expects the
government not to do, one often finds the government doing. When it comes
to our privacy, or more specifically, the invasion thereof, what Uncle Sam
can do, it often does. Therefore, the only way to ensure privacy is to
make sure Uncle Sam can't invade it. If the government can crack an
algorithm, they will. If they can't, they'll outlaw it. Uncle Sam is Big
Brother in the making, until the 'little people' decide they've had
enough. We're learning to take control of our government, slowly but
surely.

     Oh, and don't get offended by that 'Good Englishman' remark. It was
meant in humor. :-)

Yes, I've seen a device advertised as a noise diode.  The data sheet is
in my piling system somewhere, but I'm buggered if I'm going to cause an
avalanche looking for it.

Zeners (zener devices are those below approx 5V, above that it's actually
avalanche breakdown) are noisy beasts, usually due to surface imperfections -
manufacturers do try and produce low-noise versions for critical
applications.  Even noisier is the base-emitter junction of a transistor
reverse-biased into zener breakdown, and some enterprising manufacturers
marketed a transistor in a can with two leads as a noise diode (probably
using what would otherwise be rejects).

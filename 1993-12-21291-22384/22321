You have any info to back this up, including agency, etc?

If true, I would like to know (more evidence of just how intrusive
goverment is getting).

Not withstanding that many police agencies are using the new laser based
speed guns, which are harder to detect - once the detector goes off
you are pretty much nailed, because of much less scatter and 'spill' radiation
than the microwave based units produce.  If the detector sees the beam
its because you have done been 'clocked'.

But any chance/excuse to pass Yet Another Law...

Grrr.

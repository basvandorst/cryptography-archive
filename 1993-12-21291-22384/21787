I recently looked into the performance of DES/IDEA implementations
on Intel architectures.

I have a C version that does 167KBytes/sec on a Gateway 2000 (50Mhz
486DX/2), if that is any help in comparison.  Unfortunately, I
cannot release the code outside my company.  I used the Borland 3.0
C compiler for this.

I'm not sure what a real benchmark is, but I can tell you something about
how fast DES and IDEA can go, based on my own timing.
These are for the encryption functions only.  No data moving. No file i/o.
Both are highly-optimized non-reentrant assembly programs.

                   DES                 IDEA
IBM XT            1,800 Byte/sec     6,300 Bytes/sec
16MHZ 286        16,000 B/s
25MHZ 386        44,000 B/s
33MHZ 486       151,000 B/s        238,000 B/s  

The DES times include the useless initial and final permutation, so if
you just want the security you can go a bit faster.  Also DES can be 
speeded up by devoting 256K to substitution tables, which I didn't do.  
Other than that, I used every trick in the book.  And then some. 
These do not include the key loading time, so the times should not 
be used to predict key-search speeds.
Note that the IDEA / DES ratio is higher for the XT than the 486.  
I think this is do to slow 16 bit multiplication on the 486.
2K/Second should be no problem, unless you want DES on an XT.

DES:
I get about 50kbytes/sec for my asm version on a 386sx/20,
300kbytes/sec on a 486/50.  You've got a long way to go!  ;-)
 
I don't think that any major performance improvement is possible for
the 386.  I'd be surprised if I saw an improvement of more than 25%.
 
IDEA:
>for C its about 43KByte/sec, ASM 129KByte/sec
 
Not bad.  The performance of IDEA should be dominated for the time
for the multiplies.  Remember that the branch in the modular
multiplication should be coded so that it isn't usually taken, as a
pipeline stall is very costly.
 
SHS:
>39 KByte/sec in C, 74KByte/sec in ASM
 
I don't have any figures for this.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have been able to verify most numbers, and also checked some very good 
public-domain implementations available on wimsey.bc.ca
and ripem.msu.edu. Mr. Olson's performace figures, especialy the
IDEA implementation, is by far the best I heard of. Unfortunately
the code does not seem to be available.
If there are any more numbers on the performance of DES/IDEA
implementations, I would like to hear about them.

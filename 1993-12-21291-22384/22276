I would never want to have all "electronic cash" unless it was untracable and 
anonymous.  I would never want anyone, esp the gov't to know what I am 
spending it on.  Not that its illegal, its just they have no business.  I 
would hate to live in a socio-collective "star trek world".

It would have to have a hell of a protection.  Which I doubt is available now.

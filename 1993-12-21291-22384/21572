In standard algorithms/data-structures terminology, "universal hash
functions" are something entirely different than what is mentioned above
("universal" refers to *classes* of hash functions that have nice
distribution properties).  The standard definition is totally useless
to cryptographic problems, since for many universal classes of hash
functions you can easily compute words that collide with any other given
word.

I don't know if there is a different usage of "universal" for cryptographic
hash functions, but if so that would be a very confusing use of terminology.
Do you have a reference that defines "universal hash functions" like you
do above?

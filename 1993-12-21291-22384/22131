   I am interested in learning about "digital cash". I have some ideas on
   how to implement this, but I'm sure it's been thought out in detail.
   Post or email appreciated.

The crypto-related newsgroups are good places for this, as are some of
the mailing lists on crypto and mercantile protocols.  The must-read
stuff is by David Chaum; he had a paper in CACM in October 1985, pp 1030-1044, 
which talks about some of the hard problems in doing credentials and
cash while preserving privacy.  Bruce Schneier's recent book "Applied
Cryptography" has a short discussion of digital cash techniques and issues;
its real strengths are its extensive bibliography and good overview of
most of the important cryptographic techniques.

The hard technical problems include deciding what information you want to keep
private, and how private you want it to be (the more private you make
it, the harder it is to catch cheaters), what kinds of cheating you
want to catch, whether you're willing to have the system on-line or
really need it to be off-line, how to make the amount of computation
manageable while still getting all the security you want, etc.

One of the motivations for some of the digicash techniques was tollbooths -
the road-management organization needs to be able to charge a fee in a
way that the customers can't defraud the tollbooths, but the customers
need to be able to prevent the tollbooths from ripping them off too.
On the other hand, the social implications of Big Brother knowing
where you are at any given time are substantial, and customer privacy
is important.

Another motivation that has substantial social implications is the
ability to conduct your business in private, in spite of organizations
like governments who want a piece of the action.  Government
regulation of the banking industry, which is radically increasing, is
a major obstacle to some forms of digicash, since if you have real
privacy, it's impossible for the bank to report who made what
transations with whom.

The economic problem of getting people to accept bits instead of money
are a source for constant discussion, of course, in a world where most
money is created or regulated by government fiat, but people can issue
their own bits.

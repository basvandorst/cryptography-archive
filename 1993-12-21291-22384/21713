I am not clear what type of comments you want, try these:
1.      The letter is correct, it is trivial to modify data to give a
    specific CRC.  Though this requires knowledge of the polynomial used.
    A CRC is very like the remainder from division.  Think a about a similar
    problem:
        I have a 4 digit number (length of data).
        I divide it by 12 (polynomial).
        Which leaves a remainder of 7.
        It is easy for anyone to choose a different 4 digit number that
        also has a remainder of 7 when divided by 12.
2.  The letter is a little inconsistent, for simple manipulation of the
    CRC you need to be able to change the same length in consecutive bits
    as are used for the CRC.  So a 16-bit CRC requires 16 bits.
3.  Viruses don't currently try these sort of tricks.  Quality integrity
    checkers should be immune anyway to this anyway: some use more secure
    algorithims (eg MD5); those that use CRC normally select the polynomial
    on installation, so it is not/unlikely to be known by a virus; other
    information is also used, (eg file size, first few bytes, ...).

Hi, haven't read this group in a while.  It was active for quite a while but 
now your post is the only one left on it.  What happened?  Did the Clipper 
Chip die?  Did it get forced upon us?  
 
What is the latest update, if you know?
 
 
PS.  Thanks for the answer to the question of Life, the Universe and 
Everything.
 
By the way if you read the second(?) book (with the cave men in it, they 
arrange the shells, rocks,etc. so that the say "6 x 9 =")  well that's 
the Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything, to which 42 is the 
answer, in number base 13 anyways, which may explain why 13 is considered 
an unlucky numbe

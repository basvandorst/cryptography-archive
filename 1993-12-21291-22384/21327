It is said that one wild (?) idea deserves another so, here goes:
To factor a number N that is a product of two primes but itself is not
a pseudoprime, proceed as follows:
1.Find another prime,U, such that when multiplied by N yields a product
that is a pseudoprime.
2.Proceed as in the case of N being a pseudoprime. Make sure that the dummy
RSA system functions as it should, otherwise, repeat the process until it
does.
Here is an example:
N=301691737
U=3313
R=4357651
M=4355492763010884331
e=65537
d=2630494522043499473
 
Using (e,M,d) as inputs to DeLaurentis algorithm we readily find the factor
of N,16561. I wish that I had  larger collection of pseudoprimes, the one
I have is good up to 10^12.

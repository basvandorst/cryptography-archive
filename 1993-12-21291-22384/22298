I know these aren't cell phones, but a few years ago (not too many) a
man was convicted based in part by tapping his cordless phone.  He tried
to get the verdict overturned because of illegal "wiretapping."  The
court ruled that if you use a cordless phone that can be tapped
beyond your property line, too bad.  It is assumed that if you use
a cordless phone that you are not attempting to legally guard your
privacy.  

A good argument, I'd say, for having a strongly encrypted cordless
phone.

Just my $.02.

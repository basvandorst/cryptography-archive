I don't think so.  I believe the concept behind S/Key is that there
are NO secrets known to the host (or transmitted over the network).

Call "f" the fixed, one-way scrambling function based on MD4.  At
a given time, the host knows only a counter, call it N, and a value,
call it K[N], resulting from applying "f" to a "secret password"
N times.  N and K[N] are not considered secrets (nor is "f"),
primarily because K[N] has already been transmitted over the network
and may have been intercepted.  (Notice you don't send the "secret
password" over the network; to set/reset an initial state one sends
N and K[N].)

For authentication, the host asks you for your "secret password"
with "f" applied N-1 times, i.e. K[N-1].  You compute this locally
and send it.  Now, notice that K[N-1] (i.e., "the next password on
the list") is no longer a secret because it has now gone out over
the network.

To validate your supplied value of K[N-1], the host passes it
through the scrambling function one time, computing f(K[N-1]); if
you supplied the correct value of K[N-1] this will match the host's
stored copy of K[N].  Then, the host decrements N and saves the
K[N-1] you sent for use as the next K[N].

(There is also a non-secret "seed" value used sort of as an initial
value for the scrambling sequence.  This is just to protect against
people using the same "secret password" for more than one host.  If
the seeds for each host are different, then a K[N-1] intercepted on
its way to one host can't be used to access another host.)

(And, yes, the "secret password" is vulnerable to a dictionary
attack [a la Crack], and thus must be chosen carefully.)

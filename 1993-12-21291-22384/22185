I just looked here, it was last posted on 6th December, and set to expire
on 10th January.  As it has not expired here I could mail it on request.


> What's a good book on the basics of crypto techniques + a historical overview?

If you are a programmer I suggest "Applied Cryptography   Protocols,
Algorithims, and Source Code in C" by Bruce Schneier, 1993, Wiley.
ISBN 0-471-59756-2

I have had my copy for a week and it is good, it summarises some history
describes some cryto methods and algorithims (DES & IDEA in detail, others
less so).  The FAQ lists some other good books.

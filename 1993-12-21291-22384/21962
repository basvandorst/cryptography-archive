PKcrack (sp?) is available from soda.berkeley.edu.   It can be used
to mount a brute force attack on PKzip files.   I believe the code is
dos based, but can't be sure.

I believe that PKwares has updated its encryption/decryption method
recently so that such attacks are more difficult.    I think this
simply involved allowing more "false positives" so that something
like 1/256 passwords will actually produce some kind of output
which I assume must be tested to see if it contains any plaintext or
the files you need whatever.

In an effort to dispute the claim that such attacks were possible for
its  product PKwares had a contest with a ($1000 ?) prize.   They
distributed a short encrypted file that they claim was encrypted with
a key of 8 or less ascii characters.      The last I heard was that
all key combinations have been tried on the file up to 7 characters
with no success.   The person who tried this decided that trying all
the 8 character combinations would be too difficult of an operation
for him.

Basically, PKcrack is only useful if you know that key is within a
limited range like dictionary words, two short words, persons name,
address, phone number, email address, and the like.   I believe if
you want to mount a more general attack you'd have to get off the dos
machines and try something a little faster.

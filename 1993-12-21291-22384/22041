Do you by chance have and source code, binary code, or documentation showing
just how insecure ARJ is?  Are there programs that will recover an ARJ
password or decrypt an ARJ encrypted archive?  You seem to know something
inparticular to ARJ concerning the encryption that you are not mentioning.

Again, how would someone break into an encrypted ARJ archive (specifically)?

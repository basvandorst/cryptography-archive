Being in NP doesn't mean a problem is hard, all polynomial time solvable
problem are in NP. If you mean proving general theorems is NP-complete,
I don't remember but it is meaningless in this case anyway. Let's assume
it is for arguments sake.

Just because the problem of proving ANY theorem is NP-complete doesn't
imply that EVERY proof of a theorem will be exponentially long in terms
of the length of the theorem. This is the same problem that some systems
based on Knapsack problems had. Heck, the halting problem isn't
computable at all in general yet there are an infinite number of
programs that can be proven to halt in linear time to their length!

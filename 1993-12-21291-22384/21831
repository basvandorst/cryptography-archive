Dear Colleague,

And where have you been for the last x years? In industry?

There's a thriving and very active
group at Royal Holloway and Bedford New College, University of London,
under Fred Piper and Chris Mitchell, with 4 other staff, 2 postdocs and about
10 research students. You might also like to know that they run an M.Sc. in
Information Security, and undergraduate courses in Cryptology, coding theory and
all the rest. I should know, I was a Ph.D. student there.

I also know of several other groups in the U.K. 

So before you claim uniqueness of any kind, go check some facts....
maybe I`ll see you at Cirencester? Or

MOST European countries DO HAVE laws about the export of cryptography,
some also have laws about importation of cryptography. It is just that
most of the citizens/subjects of the countries are ignorant of the law.

To put up crypto software without clearing it with your lawers is a
risky buisiness. I have PEM software that I wrote but lawyers I have
spoken to reccommend that I don't make it FTPable. (From the UK)

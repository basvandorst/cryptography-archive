I've played with DES a bit... and from the little I've played,
if I had the encrypted text and decrypted text, finding the key didn't
seem that hard.. you only need to check the first small bit of text
each time... What am I missing here? checking keys by rout, would take a 
while, but hacking backwards might be faster.

Anyone have stats on DES et.al re: finding keys?  Are we talking mega
compute time or just some time?  Remember this isn't like having
SOME text out of a large section, it's about having a full document
and the encoded version.

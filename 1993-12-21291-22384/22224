If you really implemented DES (the data encryption standard) and
you encrypted an average textfile, I seriously doubt the occurence
of about 6 consecutive 0-bytes in the first 18 first characters
of the tstcrypt.txt-file. If you have invented your own non-standard
DES ;-))) you should perhaps provide us with the algorithm. (see FAQ!)

All the information I've seen has come from the press announcement,
there seems to be little critical coverage - so far.

They are very casual about this.  The card owner locks & unlocks the card
with a 4 digit number of their choice - with their "electronic wallet".
There was no information on what happens if you forget your number, (how
often do banks have to renotify PINs on ATM cards?), or your favourite
child, brother, office prankster locks the card for you.

I am not aware that any details of the protocol have been published.

Well, their 1995 trial in Swindon (UK) has to be successful first!

Presumably the electronics & protocol must be published, to allow cash
tills, telephones, vending machines, ... to use the cards.  Even if only
the microprocessor interface to the circuits is published there are huge
potentials for fraud, eg a vending machine that occasionally debits a
extra penny/cent - allowing someone to collect it at a later date.

For now I prefer cash I can touch and count.  :-)

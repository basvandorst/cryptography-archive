In my basic readings about hash functions, my understanding is that they
are one way, and not reversible. Is this always true? I ask because of
material I read in Schneiders new book that discusses the use of hash
functions as a type of block cypher. This implies reversibility (for
decryption) and now I am lost.
Thanks

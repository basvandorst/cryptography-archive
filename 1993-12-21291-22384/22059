There are some good reasons why this is true. Remember, totient(X) is
the count of numbers 1..X that are relatively prime to X. So, if X is
a power of 2, half the numbers (the odd ones) between 1 and X will be
included. Thus, totient(2^i)=2^(i-1).

For the second one, 2^i+2^(i-1) = 3*2^(i-1) is divisible by 3. If you
strike out all the even numbers between 1 and X, you will find that
1/3 of them are divisible by 3. So whey you strike those out, you have
struck out 2/3 of the numbers. So, totient(3 * 2^(i-1))=2^(i-1).

Unfortunately [fortunately for cryptology] the only way to compute
totient(X) is if you know X's factorization.

If you mean computing it without knowing the factorization of X, I
would say so: it would let you factor arbitrary integers in a very
short time. It would do what no mathematician has succeeded in doing
after 2000+ years of trying.

So, the two problems (factoring & computing totient(X)) are sort of
equivalent.

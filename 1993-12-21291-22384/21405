The demonstrable fact that the US government is trying to supress PGP is
useful information.

What is the noise level of the above statement?

newbie posts with massive details may not be the correct response.

David! David! David!  SOMA may be indicated ;)

Obcrypt:  There are very few reasons to believe cracking PGP is possible
even for the NSA.  There are many indications, the government's response

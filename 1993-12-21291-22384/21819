I understand:	Electronic CodeBook (ECB) Mode,
		Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) Mode, and
		Cipher FeedBack (CFB) Mode

for block ciphers, but could someone provide a clear explanation for the
Output FeedBack (OFB) Mode?

If I've correctly understood it, it uses the block cipher only as a one-
way hashing function with a shifting input register... a keyed Pseudo-RNG,
the output of which is XOR'd with the plain-/cipher-text to en-/de-crypt.

Have I got this right?

Is *this* the way some people are using the MD5 algorithm as an encryption
algorithm?  How secure is such a scheme based on the MD5 as a P-RNG?

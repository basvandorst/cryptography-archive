If you put Secure Drive up for anonymous FTP in Europe, you won't be 
breaking any laws.  Somehow, the copy of the program that you have was 
taken out of the USA.  Maybe the person who sent it to you broke American 
law, or maybe someone farther down the line did.  But you are right:  you 
won't be breaking any laws.  Someone else did.

You will be exposing the author of the program to certain legal risks back
here in the states, however.  You and I may think that the government 
would be wrong to take action against him.  But that doesn't really 
matter, because they probably won't consult with us beforehand.  No one 
in the Justice Department is going to say, "well, some guy in Italy says 
that Mike Ingle isn't responsible.  Let's let it slide."

If you have a copy of Secure Drive, then Mike Ingle did you a favor.  He 
spent a lot of time and effort writing a program that does something 
useful.  He gave it to you for free.  I just don't understand why people 
insist on exposing him to risk.  Is that how you repay him?

All of this talk of posting Secure Drive to European ftp sites is 
foolish.  No reputable site will carry it.  It will simply not be 
possible for a well publicized European ftp site to carry it.

All that you are doing is gauranteeing that no one else will ever release 
crypto code into the public domain again.

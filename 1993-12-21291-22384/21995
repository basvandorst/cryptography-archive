   I am working on coding some primality testing algorithms.
   468305667211 passes them but I can find a so that a^((p-1)/2) mod p
   is not 1 (p is 468305667211).  I *think* this means the number in
   question is not prime.  True?  (a is 424192645153650583361299 if 
   anybody's interested...)  (The alternative of course is that I have
   a bug somewhere...)


468305667211 is prime, therefore your alternative conclusion is the
correct one.  You have a bug somewhere.

As a matter of interest, why are you picking a>p?  Harmless enough, as
long as a is not a multiple of p, but an unusual choice nonetheless.

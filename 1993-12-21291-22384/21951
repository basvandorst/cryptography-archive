Better check your informants again...  I'd say Ken Shirriff is right,
unless you want to quibble and call the message "DRATS A DATA DASTARD",
which isn't as complete or grammatical a thought as the other version.
The facts that this is the only solution in the top few IC groups that
looks English-like, that it's the only solution in the key-space that
includes SADAT (none includes ANWAR), and that the key is provocatively
patterned (xzy) all suggest that Ken has the right idea.  But hey, I'd
be happy to be proven wrong...

If you compile the code, you'll find errors due to missing typedefs
for word16, word32 and/or byte.

On most machines these are

typedef unsigned char byte;
typedef unsigned short word16;
typedef unsigned long word32;

If you're on a machine with 64-bit longs (e.g. DEC alpha), you probably
have 32-bit ints, so

typedef unsigned word32;

If you're not on a 32-bit machine, you've got problems.

   I agree. Cryptanalysis of this system would be trivial compared to
   cracking DES, or any well-designed crypto system. However, it would
   be much more difficult than simple password capture with a sniffer.

Hell, why don't you just suggest that they people carry around a little Bazeries
cylinder?  Has a certain olde-worlde charm about it; gives reasonable security and
doesn't need batteries, displays or keyboards, all of which go wrong a lot easier
than a dozen die-molded disks and a spindle.


I'm almost serious with this suggestion.  But only almost.

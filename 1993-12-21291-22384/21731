Request for Alpha testers & developers:

I am seeking individuals interested in the testing (and development) of
Nautilus, a program that allows users to communicate with each other
digitally over public phone lines.  It requires a computer with audio
input and output capability and a Hayes compatible 9600 baud (V.32) or
faster modem.  Current supported platforms include:

+  DOS -- Requires a 386/387 or better, a soundblaster-compatible (at
          the hardware level) sound card.  A serial card with 16550s is
          strongly recommended.

+  Linux -- Requires a 386/387 or better.  Tested on Linux 0.99pl11
            with the sound driver release 0.99.8.  A serial card with
            16550s is strongly recommended.

+  SunOS -- Requires a sparcstation 1 or better with audio capability.

Support for additional platforms, including the Macintosh is planned
for the future.

Nautilus enables two users equipped as indicated above to carry on a
conversation with each other using their modems to transfer the
compressed speech.  Because of the limitations of most PC sound cards,
Nautilus currently only supports half-duplex operation.  This limitation
is expected to be removed in the future when cards capable of supporting
full duplex operation become more common.

Areas for further work on Nautilus include but are not limited
to:

+  Testing.  I'm sure there are bugs!

+  Developing additional speech coders (it is designed to accomodate
   many different coders).

+  Enhancing the user interface (it is currently command-line based).

+  Enhancing and/or redesigning the communications protocol (currently
   packet based) to make it more robust and resistant to errors.

+  Support for additional sound cards.  Requires writing a driver for
   the board or interfacing to the TSRs provided by the board manufac-
   turer.

+  Ports to other platforms (most importantly the Macintosh, but
   Windows, OS/2, and other ports would be nice).


IMPORTANT:

For the duration of alpha testing, I require that anyone who wishes
to become an alpha tester and get a copy of the source code send me
a note indicating agreement with the following:

***********

For the period of time that the code is in alpha:

+  This agreement shall be in effect until William Dorsey or a
   designated agent of William Dorsey declares the alpha test period
   to be over, or September 1st, 1994, whichever comes sooner.

+  You will not redistribute copies of the source code without the
   express permission of William Dorsey.

+  You will not use any portions of the Nautilus source code in
   any other software without the express permission of William
   Dorsey.

+  You will not add any cryptographic code to Nautilus for the
   duration of this agreement.

+  In the event of a dispute over this agreement, it will be
   governed by the laws of the State of California.

***********

Be sure to include the entire body of text between the asterisks
delineating the agreement above and be sure to include words that
indicate your acceptance of the conditions given above as well as
your full name.

The beta version of Nautilus will be released under the Gnu Public
License (GPL), so everyone's contributions to this project will
eventually be available to everyone.

I

 - am looking for addresses of crypto/security companies and lists of
   their products. 

 - define a "crypto/security company" as a company which produces
   hard/software implementing cryptographic or security related
   algorithms for any kind of application. 

 - am ready to maintain a list of the addresses I get (if there is
   interest at all) and post it in some of the security-related
   newsgroups, if the companies allow me to do so.

 - will contact each of the companies and ask them for their
   permission to add their address to this list.

I already got a number of responses, but the more the better. For
statisticians: The answers I got so far are from Sweden, USA,
England, Germany, Ireland and Canada.

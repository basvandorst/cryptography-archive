One might want numbers this big which are provably prime, but
not of a special form.  One way to do this is to show they 
have a primitive root, generating a group of size p-1. If
you use a bootstrap approach, you can then make sure that
p-1 has big prime factors.  You test numbers in an arithmetic
progression involving one or more big factors of your proposed
p-1, using Rabin or whatever.  You then prove you have a prime
by showing you have a primitive root, using the fact that you
know the factorization of p-1.

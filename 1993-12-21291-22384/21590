Simple enough to hook up a reverse biased trnasistor base-emitter
junction (biased to breakdown) with a resistor to limit current
and two nine volt batteries for the bias voltage.

Collector lead open, resistor of say 47 K ohms or so, transistor selected
to breakdown at less then the 18 volts available (most breakdown at
around 10 volts or so reverse bias).  Better frequency response than
a Zener, less capacitance in parallel, and best mounted in a metal case
to keep out 60 Hz interference.  Pretty simple and straightforward, and 
certainly a better noise source than a microphone picking up room noise.

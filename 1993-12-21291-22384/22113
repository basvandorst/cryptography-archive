     Could someone point me toward an explanation/discussion of "triple 
DES," and DES augmentations in general? 

     As I (weakly) understand it, 3DES encrypts with key A, decrypts 
with key B, and again encrypts with key A.  Why is this better than 
E(A)D(B)E(C)?  Or E(A)E(B)E(C)?  Or any other sequence of encryptions and 
decryptions with various keys? 

     While I'm at it, let me also ask about the urban legend that 
compressing a file before DES encryption makes the cryptanalyst's job 
harder.  (Doubtless this too is a FAQ; just tell me where the answer 
is.)

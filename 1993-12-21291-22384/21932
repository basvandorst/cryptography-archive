        I participated in a 1991 workshop in Oberwolfach, Germany.
Our report is
                Public-Key Cryptography:
                    State of the Art and Future Directions
                Th. Beth, M, Frisch, G.J. Simmons (Eds.)
                Lecture Notes in Computer Science  578
                Springer-Verlag, Berlin  1992

        At the end (p. 81) we recommend a 1024-bit modulus
if you want to keep your data secure for the next ten years,
but make no recommendation for 50 years.

        Twenty-five years ago the Brillhart-Morrison
factorization of F6 (39 digits) was a big advance.
Now the state of the art is general numbers around 120-130 digits
and special numbers around 150-160 digits.
If we continue at this pace, then we will be able to factor
1000- to 2000-digit numbers (perhaps 4096 or 8192 bits) in 50 years.

         Amongst 4000-bit numbers, approximately one in 3000
is prime.  The Fermat test a^(p-1) == 1  mod p
or the Rabin test will be satisfactory.

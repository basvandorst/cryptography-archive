...Assuming you were serious...

I admit this is a long way off topic, but could they also be thinking in
the back of their minds that this would shield from electromagnetic pulses
from nuclear weapons?  (Of course from detonations not close enough for
heat/blast damage).  The idea seems pretty silly to me, but then there was
some pretty silly stuff going through FEMA (U.S. federal office of
Emergency Management) in the early '80's.

Is all that EMP stuff overrated anyway?  As nuclear proliferation
continues, the possibility of a very limited (i.e. "they only had one
weapon to fire") exchanges goes up.

Back to cryptography, although this fits in with some of the conspiracy
stuff we've been reading here lately...

Summary: Details of the NatWest Mondex card
Keywords: cash electronic Mondex
X-Newsreader: NN version 6.4.19 #1

I saw a recent announcement by Mondex and the National Westminster Bank
in the UK of a smart-card for "electronic cash."  Very few real details
(as opposed to the "isn't this a great thing" details) were given.
However, I was surprised by
	(1)	the security of the system seems to rely on the security
		of the smart card and not on the nature of the protocol;
	(2)	it does not seem to implement Chaum's protocol for anonymous
		untraceable cash
	(3)	Mondex seem to think that they have a chance of making it a
		"world standard."

All 3 of the above were of concern to me, but particularly the last.  It
would be a disaster if the form of electronic cash that first become a
world standard were NOT anonymous and untraceable.

Does anyone know whether my presumtion about (1) and (2) are correct, or
whether NatWest have developed a different protocol to achieve the same
end?

For those who want an early reference to Chaum, see CRYPTO '88.  The
description of the Mondex card was published in New  Scientist and quite
a few newspapers.

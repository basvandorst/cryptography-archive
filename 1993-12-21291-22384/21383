We cannot be certain of his identity.  We can be certain that he is the
same person, or more precisely, has access to the same secret key,
as the poster of any previous messages signed with that key.

One possible reason for using an anonymous server is to avoid publishing
an e-mail address which implies an incorrect instutional affiliation.  The
anonymous server is also, by the way, an automatic forwarding server,
and it's free.

  I would tend to think that NSA can break PGP for the following reason:

    The US gvmt does not allow export of cryptosystems it can not break.
    The US gvmt allows export of RSA based systems so long as the key
length does not excede 512 bits (PGP casual grade). <ref: ITAR>

  But is the issue really if it can be broken or not? If you don't know
assume they can. The issue is more likely how large a set of resources
must be tasked to cracking a single message and for how long.

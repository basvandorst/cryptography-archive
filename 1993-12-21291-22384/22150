Is this there demo zip cracker? 10 character passwords only?  I'd like
to see this.  How fast does it crack the 10 char password?

Or is this some other cracker.  I'd wan't to see a program that could
crack zip files even if it had a 10 character only limit.

I'm skeptical.

Does this recover the password or reset the password, the 2nd is trivial
and you can get the program for free on the net.

Most of these can be broken by programs available for free on the net.

Who, me?! :-) You've gotta be kidding... Having in mind that I am
Bulgarian citizen, I am most probably an agent of the KGB, not the
CIA. (Reminds me a friend of mine who once asked: "Ah, but where's the
KGB now?" Stupid question. Everywhere, of course! <grin>) Of course,
when I came working in Germany, I was checked the the local security
agencies and they have found me "clean". But that just shows how good
my cover is. :-) (Or that they have done so intentionally and now are
watching me secretly.) Of course, if I were *really* a KGB agent, I
wouldn't tell you about that. On the other hand, I might be telling
you about that, in order to fool you to believe that I am not...

Oh, well.

Foreign address? Oh, you mean Germany. Nah, I have an even better
story for you - I am Bulgarian. No kidding.

Or the Bulgarian "Darzhavna Sigurnost". :-)

Oh, yes - and I am serious this time. You can't imagine how many PGP
users even don't know how to verify the authenticity of the package,
let alone to use it in a secure way. Or who never bother to verify the
signatures on the messages.

Yup. The only hope is that if somebody makes a bogus version, at least
those people will detect it - and then spreading the word in a way
that can be easily verified (unlike the prank that started this
thread) will quickly get out.

P.S. Followups set to alt.conspiracy only. This discussion is getting
less and less to do with encryption.

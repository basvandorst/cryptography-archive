Summary: has an analysis on this algorithm been done?
Keywords: 2nd IFIP Intl.Conference on Computer Security paper.
X-Newsreader: NN version 6.5.0 #5 (NOV)

I have a paper from the 2nd IFIP international conference on computer security
from a guy by the name of W. E. Madryga. The algorithm appears to be a VLSI
semi-friendly form, as compared to DES. Does anyone know of this one?

The conference date and place was Toronto, 1984. As I am new to the network, if
anyone is semi serious about understanding it, I can fax a few copies of it, if
it is unknown. Please advise.

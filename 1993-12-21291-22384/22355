I think we're getting a little carried away here.  What is probably
lost on much of the non-American audience (and perhaps even on much of
the American audience) is that ``the infamous "7 words you can't say
on TV"'' was a direct reference to a particular comedy routine by a
particular American comedian some years ago (and in the depths of his
anti-establishment period, to boot - on the same album as a routine
discussing how the world around him seemed to change when he "grew a
beard and got weird").  I don't believe this list was ever enshrined
in any FCC regulation, though the idea of controlling "offensive
material" on the airwaves definitely is, and there apparently has
always been some working out of this idea through limiting language
(George Carlin is not the only one to have pointed it out, though he
probably made it funnier than anyone else).

But yes, I do think it conceivable that the rules might some day once
again reach that level.  Mores swing like a pendulum in some chaos
experiment, where local motion seems monotonic and predictable, yet
somehow points farther removed have no predictable relationship.  The
scale of the thing is roughly a human lifetime, however, so the 20
year sample you or I could attest to probably gives no indication of
any long term changes.

You might ask yourself, though, if everything becomes inexorably more
liberal, monotonically forever, why on earth there were any forbidden
words left for the 70's?  Wouldn't they all have been made respectable
back about 12,000 BC?

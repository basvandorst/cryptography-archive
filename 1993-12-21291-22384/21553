No irony at all:

You should be aware that Herr Clinton and Fellow Travellers are doing
their damndest to fix the above apparant inconsistancy:  The Brady Bill
has language that make it so officials can deny a purchase for no good
reason, and they are immune from being sued for discrimination, negligence,
or any other reason or abuse, no matter WHAT they do.  The applicant
also has NO avenue of recourse or appeal.  Since Clinton, etc have
publically ADMITTED that the Brady Bill will have NO impact on crime or
violence, all that is left is harassment of the law-abiding gunowner,
and providing the hooks for a back-door ban to disarm the law-abiding,
without passing a direct law saying so.  As usual, impact on the criminal
element remains zero.

And Clinton's crime bill will outlaw the possession of any modern design
firearms - especially militia type weapons - initially 19 are specified,
but UNELECTED bureaucrats can add any others they feel like to the list.
Again, as usual, no appeal, no recourse, and criminals will not be
affected (the weapons described account for something like under 2
percent of gun crimes overall).  The goal is to disarm the PEOPLE, not
control or affect crime.  That was always the goal (you don't control
crime by attacking their VICTIMS).  Big Brother not only wants to
eliminate easy access to strong encryption, he wants to eliminate access
to guns, ALSO.  He wants to eliminate access to BOTH (and curtail a
bunch of other rights we take for granted in the process).  All to
"Protect you from yourself", or from 'terrorists' or 'drug dealers'.
Problem is, 'terrorist' can easily mean "Anybody who is an annoyance to
Big Brother..."

Start reading all the fine print.  Smell the stench of the weeds.  The
name of the game in town is CONTROL.  PEOPLE control.  The knee-capped
Bill of Rights will be but a dim memory if Clinton's "Crime Bill" passes
intact.  Look at all the end-runs around the Constitutional protections
so far.  And notice that Clinton has embraced EVERY onerous practice
from past administrations, and instead of reducing them, has EXPANDED
on them, and is adding a bunch of his own.  Hebeas Corpus 'reform' (it
is too much hassle to show a crime was actually committed, I guess),
Bail 'reform' (one gets to defend themselves from jail- probably with
their assets taken from them, too?), loosening of the Exclusionary rule
(coreced evidence will now be OK?).  When viewd in light of all this,
and more 'goodies' that haven't been mentioned (such as the 100,000 man
FEDERALLY CONTROLLED National State Police), the Clinton plans for
ones ability to maintain privacy, and his obvious contempt for the
Constitution he swore to uphold and defend become very scary, indeed.
His definiton of a 'free country' seems to be very different than
mine and others who feel the Constitution meant what it said, not what
some self-serving politician or bureaucrat says it means this week.

And what affect does the action against Zimmerman have on anyone else
that might have been considering making some improved PGP like package
generally available?  Unless one is independently wealthy, one would be
nuts to make a freeware package, with source code generally available
in this climate.  Nobody will be feel safe making available source so
one can check it out for oneself, as via FTP, or posting to the net, at
least not in the 'free' USA, if doing this will bring all this heat and
expense down on one's back (which I suspect is the general idea).  One
has to wonder what the plans are for dealing with stuff accessed from
sites from outside the US.  Probably well-addressed in the NII plan.

Wake up, folks.  It ain't ALL imaginary.

Better to plan and act as if ones freedom is in grave danger, and be
wrong, than to not do so, and find one has virtually no rights or freedoms
left in a couple of years.  If this trend isn't stopped, and SOON, what
things will be like in, oh, say 2 to 4 years is not very pretty.  My
childhood nightmare of the East and West switching roles may still come
true..  All that will be lacking is the border fences with machineguns
pointing INWARD..  :-(

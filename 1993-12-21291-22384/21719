Do you or a neighbor have a BLACK LABRADOR? They can see through wood and 
plaster and similar things that houses are made of and they can HEAR AND 
UNDERSTAND ENGLISH spoken at up to 50 meter distances! These animals 
have been bred with capability to communicate with litter mates that are 
kept by VH1 comedy writers who use downloads from the dogs to "create" 
their material. When NSA finds out about this we will be SHIT OUT OF LUCK.

You have been warned.

I saw a cordless phone in a store today that claimed to have digital
encryption.  It was one of those 900 MHz cordless phones.  The list of
features implied that the voice was digitally coded using "16-bit
encryption."  Does anyone know what kind of encryption this might be,
and how strong it is.  This particular phone was selling for $200, if
that's any help.  Would it be safe for me to give out a credit card
number using such a phone?

Thanks,

- Jay

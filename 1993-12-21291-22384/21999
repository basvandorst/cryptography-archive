I would like to know if IDEA encryption is closed under composition;
i.e., is encrypting a plaintext under one IDEA key and the encrypting the
result under another key always equivalent to a single encryption under a
single key?... If so IDEA might be weaker than would otherwise be the case.

Like to hear from U all...

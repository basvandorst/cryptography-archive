When i got cellular service last month i asked about digital.  The salesman
told me that it was being trailed here in Dallas by SWBell but wasn't
generally available yet.

It's my understanding that the airlink approach you describe first is
the method for both North American digital cellular and GSM.  Speaking
of which, does anyone know an easy way to get a description of the CAVE
algorithm used in North American cellular, or is its distribution
restricted?

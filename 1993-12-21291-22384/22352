Strange.. one would say that stuff like this would be relaxed gradually.
I mean, in general one can say more on tv than 20 years ago - I don't
suppose anyone imagines that this can successfully be reverted to the
old situation?

Anyway, I think that one can safely use these words (and their transtlations)
on the Dutch tv; nobody is going to stop you if you do something as
simple and innocent as that.

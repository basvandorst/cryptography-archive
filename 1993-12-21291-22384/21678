You - maybe not, but Phil Zimmermann has decided different and
deserves our acclamation for that. Besides, by having the whole world
able to examine the source, it is possible to make the program more
secure - after all, he might have put some security holes in the
implementation simply by mistake!

And there *were* problems with PGP, mind you... One of the versions
(2.1, I believe) used to trash the hard disk on MessyDOS machines. And
nothing - the bug has been discovered and fixed. The encryption part
can be also improved a bit (the primality testing, the IDEA IV, etc.)
and I guess that the developers are working on that.

Recall that word frequency follows approximately Zipf's observation of
frequency as the inverse of its ordinal position in the ideal frequency list.

So the 10,000th most common word occurs about 1/10,000th of the time. 
What this means is a hyperbolic form to the curve and thus comparatively
little difference after a while, such as after the 1,000th entry or so.

The upshot is that after the first few hundred most frequent entries
estimated for a particular corpus, you could pretty much choose the
remainder at random and not misrepresent the true word frequency significantly.

My Moby Words product has two 1,000 'most frequent' lists, a 70,000
list of words 'most commonly found in dictionaries', separate places
and names lists so you can add for spelling checkers, the Scrabble (R)
lists and of course the main corpus of 600,000 words and phrases.

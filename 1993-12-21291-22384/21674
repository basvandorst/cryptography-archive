Unfortunately, I have the impression that the information there is
slightly out-of-date. I would prefer to get a direct reply to the
question asked from the people who run the keyservers.

Yes, me too... Two keyservers, both in the USA, both were closed with
no explications given, both were closed rather fast... Is it what
we're all thinking about or are we just paranoid?

[list deleted]

I have installed a public key server at our site as an experiment. It
took quite a long time, because I am not root on our machine and a
regular user installing such software is not a trivial task and has
some security implications.

Till now, our server was syncronized only with one of the US ones.
Now, after two US servers have been closed down, I would like to
activate ours and to syncronise it with all other servers around the
world. It is currently working (you can get and send public keys); it
is just not syncronized with the other servers.

Could please those who are running such servers and agree to have them
syncronized with ours contact me, so that I can include their site in
my CONFIG file?

The information for our server is:

pgp-public-keys@fbihh.informatik.uni-hamburg.de
	Vesselin Bontchev
	bontchev@fbihh.informatik.uni-hamburg.de
	FTP: ftp.informatik.uni-hamburg.de:/pub/virus/misc/pubkring.pgp

Requests to the server are processed every 15 minutes.

Regards,
Vesselin

I'd be somewhat careful about doing anything with Madryga.  Although there are
no publicly known attacks, various people have expressed misgivings about it.
Apparently it doesn't exhibit a very good avalance effect.  There are more ones
than zeroes in some samples of ciphertext.  Eli Biham has doubts about it.  An
analysis of it presented at Auscrypt a few years ago revealed that it had some
unusual statistical properties not exhibited by other block ciphers.  There are
various other things which I don't remember at the moment - I think Bruce
Schneier covers it in "Applied Cryptography" in more detail.

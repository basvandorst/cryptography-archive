It would seem to me that from a purely logical standpoint, if you are
taking your software abroad for entirely personal use, and do not plan
to resell or give copies away, that you are not really exporting
anything and therefore do not need to worry about it.  If I take my
laptop with me on a trip, I am not now an exporter of laptops (unless
I sell it while away).  Just my $0.07 (adjusted for inflation) worth.

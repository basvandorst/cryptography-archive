On the topic of PGP...

Now I *finally* understand what all these idiotic rambling posts
from John_-_Winston really are -- encrypted messages!  

In the case of PGP, after encryption the output looks like a bunch of 
meaningless letters, but in this case some very clever person
has created an encryption scheme where, after encription, the
output reads like the mindless ramblings of an insane fool!

Clever.  Very clever indeed.

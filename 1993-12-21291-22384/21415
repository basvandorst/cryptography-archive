Assuming nanotechnology, minimum hardware required is 128 + 64 + 64 hydrogen
atoms (key + plaintext + ciphertext), 4.2e-22 grams.  Actually, IDEA has
several stages and you'll need more than just hydrogen atoms; assume
the mass of a cracking engine is 5 orders of magnitude larger -> 4e-17 grams.

How fast can the cracking engine run?  Probably in the GHz range...
If you require exhaustive testing in 1 year, this requires 1e22 machines,
which would weigh about 400 kilograms.

Obviously this is beyond the present capabilities of even the NSA,
but I would not want to say that this is a physically impossible task.
We routinely do things today that people 100 years ago would consider
impossible.  Heck, most of our economy was "impossible" 100 years
ago (e.g., air transportation, computing, national distribution of
goods, etc).  And don't forget the early projections of the national
computing needs!  Nanotech may be an extreme case, but stopping
short when identifying "impossible" tasks seems foolhardy.

Now, well before you double the number of key bits the mass the nanotech
machine is larger than a good-size *star*, so that does seem to be
physically impossible to enumerate in a reasonable time, with our
current understanding of physics.

     Well, if you consider the average 11:00 news to be at all correct,
that's what they said. I would assume it's the FCC, since radar is
transmitted signals, and a detector is one receiver of said signals. If
I'm wrong, PLEASE let me know. :-)

     Funny part is, with my CB, I can find any cop within 300 miles.
Listen to channel 19 on the average highway -- you'll hear people calling
smokeys. They won't help themselves until they ban CB's -- something that
won't happen all that readily.

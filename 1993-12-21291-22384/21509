As I understand it, one of the lynch pins in the security offered by PGP is 
that it is infeasable to operate a secret key without obtaining the passphrase 
with which that key is itself encrypted. 

If Ralph Finch has a proof that this is not so, its demonstration - as 
opposed to allegation - would be most worthwhile and welcome.

Well, how about it?   

......Or have I misunderstood the claim?

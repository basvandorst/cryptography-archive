I passed some of the messages concerning Harvey Dubner to Bob, his son,
who developed the hardware that Harvey uses.  He asked me to post the
following reply...

====================================

I just forwarded your message to my father.  It doesn't matter especially to
me if it looks like he or I gets the credit.  What you might do is pass on a
reply to Roger Bryner (bryner@chemistry.utah.ed):

---------

Roger, Dick Zeitlin has been kind enough to pass this on -- I don't have
access to the user groups.  I'm Bob Dubner; I designed and programmed the
Cruncher board.  The architecture is, indeed, open -- we supply the board
and a full set of C routines for accessing it: add, subtract, multiply,
divide, A**B mod C, etcetera. Harvey, my father, writes higher-level
routines for doing number theory.

When you get the Cruncher, you also get all the software we've written.

There's a lot of possibilities -- one fellow in England has thrown away much
of our stuff, written his own, and created some Unix daemons -- the PC with
the Cruncher sits on the LAN and acts as a big-number-arithmetic server,
that kind of thing.

Paul Leyland's explanation is a good one.  For small numbers (under 3000
bits or so) the Cruncher's performance is compromised by overhead -- at 512
bits, a 486/33 with Cruncher is only about six times faster than the
computer without.  At thirty thousand bits, the Cruncher is about 80 or 100
times faster than the PC.

Any other questions?  I hope Dick will be good enough to continue passing
these on, or you can contact me directly at 73247,2334@compuserve.com

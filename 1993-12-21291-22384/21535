Aw, hell, I can break 512-bit RSA keys. Let's say $10,000,000 per key.
Reasonably quick turnaround guaranteed. (Offer available only to U.S.
citizens.) Keep in mind that the NSA's yearly budget is roughly 1000
times as large as this. Also, the NSA can build specialized hardware,
decreasing the cost dramatically.

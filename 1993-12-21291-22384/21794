You might want to tell that to the little fella down in the RF measurements
lab.  Well, maybe *after* I finish measuring the noise figure on the LNA.

A "Noise Diode" is typically a thermally compensated diode which is designed
to give a nice flat noise output over a wide frequency.  They're used widely
in RF work to characterize the noise figure of RF amplifiers.

HP sells them, and I'm pretty sure the other RF instrumentation folks market
them as well.

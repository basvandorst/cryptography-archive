Another month has passed since I last issued a progress report for the
RSA-129  project.  Relations continue to pour into MIT, the rate
getting ever faster.  It is a disappointing day now when we don't
receive at least 40 thousand relations, and the 50 thousand barrier
has been breached several times.

As of 0600UT, 20 December 1993, we have a total of 3,490,714 relations
which is almost 1.5 million more than we had a month ago.  These break
down into 45350 full relations (fuls), 588663 partial relations (pars)
and 2856701 double partials (pprs).  The fuls are useful as they stand
but the pars and pprs must be combined into cycles.  They currently
generate 27609 cycles.  When the sum (fuls+cycles) reaches 524400, we
are virtually finished.  The sum is now 72959, but we are much further
than 14% done (that is, 72959/524400) as the number of cycles grows
rapidly with the number of partial and double partial relations we
collect.  Indeed, I estimate that we are now about 40% completed.  As
time goes on, it will be ever easier to give ever more accurate
estimates.

Many thanks to everyone who has taken part so far, and I encourage you
to continue to play such a valuable role.  Your donations of idle
cycles on your PC's, workstations, supercomputers and fax machines may
not be tax deductible, but they are a truly charitable donation.  If
anyone else would like to join us, and make a present of machine time
that would otherwise go to waste, please send for further information
from rsa129-info@iastate.edu.

No, I am not joking about the fax machines.  A US corporation has
pressed some of its fax machines into service as mpqs workers.  I
don't know what kind they are, but they sound pretty impressive to me.

Summary:

	Approx 40% completed,
	45350 fuls, 588663 pars, 2856701 pprs, 27609 cycles.

P.S.  If anyone knows a good way to count the number of cycles in a
graph containing over 5 million nodes and 3.5 million arcs, please let
me know.  It must run in as little memory as possible, ideally less
than 16Mb, and use as little scratch filespace as possible.  Your
program has to beat one written by Arjen Lenstra and myself, which
uses 105 minutes cpu on a DEC 5000/240 (about a 20MIPS machine), 13Mb
memory and 120Mb scratch storage.  Oh yes, and it has to read almost
900 megabytes of raw data.

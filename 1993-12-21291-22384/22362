SIGINT is "signals intelligence".  Many people would call that "communications
gathering".  In the US, it is also called "eavesdropping" and "wiretapping".

Only if you would be surprised at the garbage that the gov't considers 
"sensitive" enough to classify.  (U) stands for 'the following paragraph is
Unclassified'.  Hardly troublesome.  Besides, anything released under the
US Freedom of Information act either was not classified or was declassified.

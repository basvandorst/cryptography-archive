   Nice idea, but you would need to modify it somewhat.  One of the
major problems intelligence agencies have is deciding whether or not
to believe documents obtained from spies, double agents, etc.  If you
could validate documents by comparing the signature for the purloined
document with the published signature, it would make things much
easier for spies.

   What you need is a self-referential system.  For example, the
published certificate could be the the hash of both the plaintext
enciphered with a random key and the key itself.  About as hard to
spoof, but validation without the hidden key is impossible.  The key
could be set up so that it was never visible, now you need a Rip van
Winkle system so that the key becomes available after say 20 years,
but not before.

   An interesting possibility for the RvW algorithm is as follows.
Use X for the key where X is generated randomly.  The document
authenticator marks the document with Y = X^k mod N for some small k
and composite (but unfactored) N with no small factors.  Only when N
can be factored are the Y values useful, and the digests potentially
useful. You would probably want to use something like one value of N
per day.  Even if it is compromised, the hypothetical spy still needs
to get the value Y which will be much more closely held than the
plaintext copies of the document it is associated with.

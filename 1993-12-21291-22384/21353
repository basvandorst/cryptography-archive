   It is Time to stop your lies!

   Why don't you post your *algorithm* and source codes?

What makes you think I'm lying?

The algorithm and source codes are publically available.  The only
reason I don't post them is that they are relatively large and of
limited interest to most readers of these groups.  If you want a copy,
use anonymous ftp to get the file mpqs.tar.z (or MPQS.shar.Z) from
either black.ox.ac.uk (129.67.1.165) or toxicwaste.media.mit.edu
(18.85.0.40).  The directories are /math/rsa129 and /pub/rsa129
respectively.

Hi,
	I was reading a paper about learning, where the author uses
the concept of "random functions". The paper mentions that random functions
are not known to exist, but people do believe they exist and could be 
found. Since the paper is somewhat old, I wonder whether these random
functions were found in the last years. 
	Could anybody tell me something about random functions? Is it
an open problem? Who solved it?

		Thanks a lot,
			Fabio Cozman

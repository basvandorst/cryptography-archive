Of course it is, my question remains the practice of unlocking.  I
can buy software on disks and give it out.  Clearly illegal.

My question to this is: define password and keys... If I crack the
REAL key code to any particular file, this isn't the 15digit code
that they give out, it's more like the real back door.  Yeah, it's
a password, but nothing they give out.  Would that be a felony as well?
Yes, a jury might convict on it, but I wonder how the law is written.

And traffic?  giving out a sequence of strings which just happen to
crack a disc?  My biggest problem with CD unlocking is that unlike
software piracy via disk/mail/whathaveyou, a CD is being sold to
the publishers as 'safe' AND numerous software is all in one place.
(For instance, one of the discs I'm beta testing contains most of
the Microsoft catalog.  A CD and a small program floating on a bbs
has the potential to unlock 600megs of stuff at once.  Far cry from
the minor copying of even a 20 disc program.

hmm: 'Joe, here's a program that unlocks the stuff on that disc you
got it.  After all, you HAVE the disc already...' 
After dealing with the SPA a bit (I called them regarding one case
of a CD vendor publishing a few items they darn well shouldn't have...
including some games from one place the lawyers love to sue...) and they
really had little interesting in following it up.  Now imagine having
an entire disc unlocking at will.  Untraceable.  based on a SMALL program
as small as oh... 3 or 4K...

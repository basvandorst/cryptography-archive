Surprisingly, version 2.04g uses the same "notoriously weak encryption
method", with just some implementation improvements which make brute
force cracking more difficult. I am still not aware of anybody who is
able to crack *arbitrary* encrypted ZIP archives, even if they are
encrypted with PKZIP 1.1.

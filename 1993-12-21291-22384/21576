Dont specifically know of these test - but if short cycles
do exist it is better if they do not track each other.
For example if two short-cycles such as

	21-25-29-21 and 23-27-31-23

exist - if attacker has the knowledge of one short-cycle and the
other cycles seem to synch - then prediction capability may be more.

Incidentally, the above pattern is generated when you take 0-31
forward add 11 mod 32 and then reverse add 25 mod 32 to the
result before.

I would add "inconsistent" cycle lengths and cycle trackings are
good things too [unless a math guru enlightens otherwise]

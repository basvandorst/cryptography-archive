My understanding is that regulation is indeed law.  The idea is that an 
Act (probably what you are thinking is the law) is implemented by 
regulations.  For example, the ITAR are regulations.  They implement the 
Arms Import and Export Control Act.  It is a regulation that explicitly 
requires a munitions export license to export "cryptographic devices and 
software".  And, it is the law.

In the 18th century, Congress did write the regulations as well as the 
enabling act.  There's a fascinating book on early American cryptography, 
by (Richard?) Weber.  He relates that Adams (I think it was) asked 
Congress to enable the Administration to open and read the citizens' 
mail, because, it was alleged, the wicked British were stirring up 
trouble, circulating harmful materials among the common people. 

According to Weber, Congress groaned, but gave the Adams admin the 
requested law, stipulating that Congressmen's mail was not to be opened 
and read.  However, Congress must not have believed that the 
Administration would respect the stipulation.  Weber says that the use of 
cryptography by Congressmen shot up markedly in this period. 

The favorite code by the way was the Virginia House of Delegates code.  
It was a code book.

There is truly nothing new under the sun, is there?

Weber quotes the Postal Act affected, and so I could see that Congress once 
wrote both regs and act.

It was unworkable and some time later (when I don't know -- would a 
historian please fill us in?) the implementing regulations were separated 
from the enabling act.

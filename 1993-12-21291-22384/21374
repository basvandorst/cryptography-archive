So, when you say the problem is tractable because alice may chat by just
wanting to fix a single bit, does this mean hashes are really not
computationally unique (that is infeasible to duplicate a given hash
from different input)? If so is there a "minimum" size of a message
that can be safely hashed?
thanks

how about a reversed bias 1N34A?? (grin)

you can probably find microwave noise diodes, but not in the catalogs
you mentioned.

for lower frequency use, one typically uses the base-emitter junction of a
(cheap) transistor reverse biased.  you can find circuits around in audio
project handbooks, possibly the Radio Amateur's Handbook, the Music
Engineer's Handbook, or the construction instructions for the Noise Source
module in the PAIA 4700 series synthesizer modules.

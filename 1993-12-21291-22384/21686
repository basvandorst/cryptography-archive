FSF/GNU is based in Cambridge, MA (around MIT), where Richard Stallman is.
They are a registered charity in the U.S., which is why contributions
are tax-deductible in the U.S. They do have revenues [donations and
distribution fees for software] and expenses. Presumably, they do have
something to lose by an IRS attack.

[Not that I believe any of this 'NSA can break PGP' fearmongering.]

Emacs info gives the following address for the FSF:
     Free Software Foundation
     675 Mass Ave
     Cambridge, MA 02139
     USA

Where do you think it's based?

On another note, Thompson's modifications to the C compiler were based
on detecting certain system calls. That's a very different thing from
detecting _algorithmic steps_ [of the key generation] and modifying
them. Very doubtful that this could be done - especially if you want
it to work with all future versions and any slight modifications of
the PGP source code.

Where does the random seed to PGP come from? (I assume this is an easy
question - I just don't know the answer)

Where did you hear about Rabin-Miller strong pseudoprimes ?

While the Miller-Rabin test may say a number is prime when
it is not, there are no numbers which regularly fool the test.

The Miller-Rabin test is a randomized algorithm.  For any odd
composite N, a single iteration of Miller-Rabin has at least
a 1/2 chance of proving N to be composite.  
(See  Coreman, Leiserson, Rivest. _Introduction to Algorithms_.
McGraw Hill, 1990. pages 839-844 )

In practice, a randomly chosen odd N which passes a single
iteration will almost always be prime, but even the if N is
the most evil of pseudo-primes, it has no better than a 50%
chance of passing on each iteration.  M iterations reduce
the chance to 2^-M.

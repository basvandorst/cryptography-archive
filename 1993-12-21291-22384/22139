What my book is really lacking is a detailed discussion of the newer
digital cash protocols; e.g. the ones discussed at Crypto 94 and Eurocrypt
94.  Those are much more efficient than the ones I describe in my book.
There is also a Chaum paper in Oct 82 (I think) Scientific American that
talks about secure credentials; this is related to digital cash.  Start
with those three places, and then wait for Springer-Verlag to publish that
various proceedings.

 I think not.  Apparently my comments have been too discreet.

 When a validation protocol is required for secure operation, I
 expect that the cipher program require that protocol to be used
 for any operation.  When a validation protocol is required for
 secure operation, I expect that the design of the protocol will
 be discussed and arguably be at least as secure as any of the
 other cipher mechanisms.  Otherwise, the strength of the other
 mechanisms is beside the point.

 When we have a secret-key cipher, we have the serious problem of
 transporting a key in absolute secrecy.  However, after we do this,
 we can depend on the cipher providing its level of technical
 secrecy as long as the key is not exposed.

 When we have a public-key cipher, we apparently have solved the
 problem of transporting a key.  In fact, however, we have only done
 so if we ignore the security requirement to validate that key.
 Now, clearly, validation must be easier than secure transport, so
 it can be a big advantage.  But validation is not trivial, and
 many people do not understand that it is necessary.

 When we have a public-key cipher and use an unvalidated key, our
 messages could be exposed to a spoofer who has not had to "break"
 the cipher.  The spoofer has not had to break RSA.  The spoofer
 has not had to break IDEA.  Thus, discussion of the technical
 strength of RSA and IDEA are insufficient to characterize the
 overall strength of such a cipher.  In contrast, discussion of the
 technical strength of a secret-key cipher *IS* sufficient to
 characterize the strength of that cipher.

 Discussion of the strength of public-key cipher mechanisms is
 irrelevant without a discussion of the strength of the public-key
 validation protocol.  Private-key ciphers need no such protocol,
 nor any such discussion.  And a public-key cipher which includes
 the required key-validation protocol can be almost as much trouble
 as a secret-key cipher which needs none.

Actually, what I've been doing with all those business cards I've
received is quite simple.  Basically, I own all the print shops in the
wold (through an invisible cartel.)  Now, whenever someone finds they've
run out of business cards and comes to buy some new ones, I simply sell
them their *old* ones.  They don't even notice if some of them have been
folded or written on;  I mean, how many people read their OWN cards?

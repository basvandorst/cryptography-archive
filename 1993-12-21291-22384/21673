I think there are good heuristic for O(n/(log n)^3) for the distribution of Carmicheal numers. It is the same argument as O(n/(log n)^2) for prime twins. The reason is that if three numbers in certain arithmetic progressions are concomitently prime, their product is a Carmichael number! This heuristics are however no proofs - you know Goldbach's weeker conjecture (an infinity of prime twins) has not been proved yet!

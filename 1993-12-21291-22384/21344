Is anybody but me curious about the Prosody story?  Is there a company
called Prosody?  Is there any reason to believe they had a product beyond
a posting from a Delphi user that appeared to be cryptographically
unsophisticated?  Does this seem to <anybody> like NSA's M.O.?  Wouldn't
one expect the contact to come in the form of a court order, like the
Zimmerman and Ward operation... and not from NSA?

If Prosody and Keithwriters and Mirrorshades are all real, sorry for the
suspicion... but the "NSA bust" story is sufficiently unusual that I'd
like to see some independent confirmation on it.

Does anyone know of published examples of very cut-down DES style encryption
algorithms ... not for actual use, but suitable for teaching purposes to
illustrate the fundamentals of S-Box design, key scheduling etc.

I am really thinking of something that might be only 3 or 4 rounds, with
a 16 bit (max) key and plaintext block size.

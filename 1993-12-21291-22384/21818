Is this faster than the algorithm of Feldemeier (sp?) and Karn for
standard DES?  The first paper by Pfitzmann and A{\ss}mann described
schemes to speed up a much weaker system than DES called G-DES, which
had the disadvantage of being slower as well.  (It allowed the S-boxes
to be altered in a key dependent way, which is a Very Bad Thing.)

Subject: can ELM encoded messages be decoded without the key?

i have been using the mail package elm.  it has an encode
feature that allows the sender to specify a "decryption"
key, to be used at the other end.

far as i know, it uses a couple of "half-rotors" to scramble
the original key, then creates a salt, that is used by "crypt"

i have sent this message to the folks that maintain elm.

anyone know of a way to get to the original mail messages?

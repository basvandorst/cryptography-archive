Welcome.

Your initial approach does seem a little doctrinaire and lacking in academic 
rigour; but perhaps I'm reading you wrongly.

On what grounds do you state that you know what NSA or any other closed 
research group have managed to achieve?

Since you maintain that TEMPEST is declassified, perhaps you would care to 
list here the both the military and commercial nomenclatures 
(for any participating country) and post the full specifications to which 
those nomenclatures pertain? Many here would be most grateful.

If you are unable to post those specifications, perhaps you could say why you
do not have them and how, without those standards, you can advise with 
authority on how to bring an equipment to one or other of those 
specifications?

On the other hand, you really needn't reply unless you would like to. I 
suspect that my plonker has just been pulled (oh, frubtious joy!) by a frisky 
undergrad. ;-))))

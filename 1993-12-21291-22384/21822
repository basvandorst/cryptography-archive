I suspect a big fraction of the time is spent doing multiplication,
which takes about the same number of cycles (i.e. a lot) on both
the Intel 386 and 486.  As I never tire of mentioning, the Cyrix/TI
486SLC/DLC has a parallel multiplier that is over 5 times faster.
I'd be interested in hearing how fast your routine is on that
processor, if you get a chance to test it.  (A lot of notebook
computers use the TI part now, so you might just try one out
in a computer store or something).

Is the current version available on the net?

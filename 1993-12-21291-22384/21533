I think it's quite easy to use the pgp algorithm to build up a OTP over
time - you do all your IO with your unix machine via a wrapper like the
unix 'script' command, or the 'screen' command, slightly altered to log
the *times* of keystrokes (taking care to choose a bit from the time
function that fluctuates randomly, and to discard any key presses that
are too close together, as you'd get from an autorepeat key or slow
CPU access).  I just may hack this one up myself, since I've got the
code handy (actually I posted it to alt.sources recently - if you want
to hack it yourself, look for 'logging-csh.c')

Ditto in the UK. The police caught people *using* the information by 
one night (at a very late hour) spoofing an alien landing report on 
their band, giving location, but requesting that all people should be 
warned away from the area.

Needless to say, anyone who turned up to watch at the remote location 
was arrested...

The news report said this was based on a similar operation in the USA.

Listening is OK, but passing on or acting upon the information is 
forbidden.

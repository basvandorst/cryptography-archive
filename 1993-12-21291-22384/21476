Doesn't PGP encrypt the private key using IDEA?  If this is the case
then your private key is encrypted with at least as much security as
a PGP-encrypted message.

>2) The pass phrase is available, but not the private key.

Not much one can do with only the pass phrase.  It contains no information
about the private key.

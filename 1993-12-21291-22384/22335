Probably an accurate valuation of the comment. There's no reason there
should be a connection between the cost of a set of encryption/decryption
hardware and the cost to break a system. You can probably get a pair of
chips to do RSA for under $500 (maybe under $100) but the capital cost of an
RSA cracking machine would be quite a bit higher if you expect to get a
solution in your lifetime and a reasonably long key is used.

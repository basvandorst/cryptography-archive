I didn't know about S/key but both it and my suggestion are re-inventions
of the one-time pad, which has been around for millenia, which helps
even further in showing it's a good idea  :)

You have to use long strings.  With a 6 digit (decimal) number,
there'd be 10^6 possible passwords.  A cracker could easily hash them
all by exhaustive search and see which one matched any given entry in
your hash file.  Even with a password space of 10^15 (say), suppose
your system has 1000 users and each user's hash file has 1000 entries,
so the cracker gets a million hashed passwords.  So any password the
cracker generate at random has about 10^-9 chance of matching one of
these million hashed passwords.  So he need generate only about .5
billion random passwords offline, before probably finding a match.
This might take only a few cpu hours on a fast PC--it is the "birthday
paradox" from statistics in different clothes.  That's why I suggested
a password space of at least 64 bits (10^19).

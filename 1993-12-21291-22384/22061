It appears to me that you DO have a shared secret, namely the next password on the list!
It should not be difficult to modify the S-Key protocol to accept one password as the
authentication and ask if you want an encrypted session (obviously, you answer "no" when
using a dumb terminal incapable of encryption).  If the answer is "yes", the next password
on the list is used as the encryption key for a symmetric encryption algorithm such as
DES or IDEA.  Of course, both passwords are discarded after the session ends.

Have I overlooked something simple?

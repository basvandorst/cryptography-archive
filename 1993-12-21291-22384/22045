It's been pointed out to me that my hypothesis about large numbers
of 1 bits increasing avalanching due to carry propagation is
complete bunk.  If a key x gets good avalanching when added to text
y, then you'll get the same from ~x if the text is ~y.  (~x+~y =
-x-1-y-1 = -(x+y)-1-1 = ~(x+y)-1, which is pretty close.)

I apologize for firing from the hip like that.

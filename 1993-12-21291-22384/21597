				  *NO*

It should read:

The definition of a Carmichael number is that it is a composite number N
that passes the Fermat test of primality for all bases for which
gcd(base, N) = 1.

(I.e., only bases which are a multiple of a factor of a Carmichael
number demonstrate the composite nature of that number.)

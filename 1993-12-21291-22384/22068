Dear Networkers,
	I'm interested in scanning the knowlegde base of this fine network for
algorithms pertaining to data encryption and decryption.  You might say It's a
hoby of mine, because I then woudl like to implement these processes in a
compurter languse, say Modula-2 or C.  I've implemented the array indexing
algorithm via Mod-2, an am intersted in new or strange, and not necessesarily
fast alogorithms.  
	Also, are there any ftp sites devoted to these times of algorithms?


					thanks in advance,

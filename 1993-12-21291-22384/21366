You must be kidding.
What about functions that are super-exponential, like 2**(2**n)?
For what definition of general theorems would the above be true?

(10**99999)..(10**100000-1)? Done. It is amazing what a good optimizer
can do.

What is ATP?

>Yet, someone solved it. 

How about looking at the program that was used to generate the proof?

How about thinking about the size of the smallest program to generate
a proof in a reasonable time?

Have fun!

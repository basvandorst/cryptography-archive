       acsii data (i.e. not binary).  I wrote some code to do a encryption I

       something like to pkzip to compress the encrpted file, can this be 
       compared to the non encrpted compressed file to determine anything 
       about the quality of the encryption.  I think I read somewhere that 
       any good encryption removes any patterns there by making compression 
       useless.....

This is correct.  If you want to be able to compress the data, you
have to compress it *before* you encrypt it.  Then, after its
encrypted, if you want to ASCII-ize it, that is ok.  However pkzip
after encryption shouldn't work, especially if it is a good encryption
scheme.

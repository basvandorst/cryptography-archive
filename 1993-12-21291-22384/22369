Might if be helpful, if a group was form to send ever member of congress a
disk containing PGP and Secure Drive software?
 
We could add a cover letter explaining the need for privacy and the need
for changes in the export laws etc.
 
If we could get even 10 percent of congress persons using secure drive and
pgp, it seem to me we have a must better chance of getting the
government to see reason.
 
comments?

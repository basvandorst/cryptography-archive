Ok, so what is SIGINT, and who should be worried about it?

Also, isn't it kinda troublesome that this was classified????

Of course if the XXXXXed stuff discusses the nature of the trapdoor
in the clipper algorithm I could understand why.  I get the feeling
from this document that the authors fully realized how stupid the 
whole concept of the clipper chip is.

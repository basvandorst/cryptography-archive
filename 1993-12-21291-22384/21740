The funny thing is that in my factoring method I have not insisted on
using the Carmichael numbers! You can use bona fide primes and I will still
factor your number. Sure, if your modulus is a Carmichael number that is
even better. As to the probability of hitting a Carmichael number in
a random search, I am thinking about it! Meanwhile, use the Dubner method
to construct a Carmichael number at will.

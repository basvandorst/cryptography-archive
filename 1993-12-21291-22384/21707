Dear Colleagues,

At various times on the net I have seen discussions of the `limits of
computation': how many instructions will the universe `allow' us
to execute.  Most of these discussions give upper bounds. For
example recently on Sci.crypt, Paul Ciszek (pciszek@nyx10.cs.du.edu),
Thor Kristoffersen (thor@unik.no) and others gave very nice arguments
based on thermodynamics that yielded an upper bound of approximately
10^50 instructions per thousand years.  I am interested in a lower bound.

How many  `instructions' has mankind executed so far?

Let me give one ground rule: an instruction is counted iff it
was executed on a manufactured device (ie no meatware).

Thanks
Len Adleman

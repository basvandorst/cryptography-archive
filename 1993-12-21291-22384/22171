"AFAIK" stood for "As Far A I Know", of course. :-) Honest, I didn't
know about Weiner's paper on this subject, but from your message it is
very clear how the attack works.

Well, PGP uses 17, not 3. I do remember Colin mentioning about some
problem if you encrypt a message to more than 17 recepients, but, as
far as I recall, he also said that it's not really a problem in PGP.
Probably PGP pads the session key with random junk (the obvious
solution), but I have not checked whether it really does that.

Ann Landers is a syndicated advice columnist based in the U.S.A.  She
has a staff who check up on things for her, and some good connections
with doctors etc., but she does make some mistakes.  And because she
deals with emotional issues more often than factual ones, she tends to
adopt stories without necessarily making careful checks on their
voracity, if they fit in with her world view.

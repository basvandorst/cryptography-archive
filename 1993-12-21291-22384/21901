Well, I'm not a historian, but this would agree with everything I've read 
on the origin of writing.  Most early writing, I have read, are tax 
records -- Kahn mentions this -- like tripod with broken leg.  Presumably 
the broken leg meant a lower tax.  IMO, writing was *not* invented to 
record significant culture.  Poetry was used for that (things like 
religion, history, etc., were all poetry long before writing).  Probably 
we would have no writing except for taxes, tribute (extortion?) of a 
government in a society grown too complex for the king's memory to keep 
tax dues straight.

What is interesting in the report is the direct connection made between 
the invention of abstract numbers and the invention of writing.

BTW, I believe that the invention of blank is as significant for writing 
as 0 is for arithmetic.  According to Boorstin's _Discoveries_, the 
learned monk Alcuin invented blanks to help teach Latin in Charlemagne's 
schools.

France cut prices of condoms to encourage youth to use them.  Said Ministry of

condoms, Britons 160 million.  The French used 100 million.  We can catch up
but we must go faster." -- NY Times squib

I agree. Cryptanalysis of this system would be trivial compared to
cracking DES, or any well-designed crypto system. However, it would
be much more difficult than simple password capture with a sniffer.

Yeah. But these are expen$ive. We already have custom cryptocalculators
for a lot less $ than that. Dunno if the additional market reach would
amount to much.

Thanks for your views. I'd like to hear from others.

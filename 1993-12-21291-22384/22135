Here is a rather delicious new problem, and one raised by a lawyer rather
than by a techie. 

How do you check software resident in a tamper-proof cryptographic module 
to ensure that it doesn't infringe one of your patents or copyrights?

The problem was raised by Derrick Grover in `Random thoughts on problems
with new technology', in the Computer Law and Security Report, Jul/Aug 93,
pp 155 - 156. His suggested solution is that every tamper resistant device
should have a supersecret key which can be used (on production of a court 
order) to dump the memory.

Maybe one of our readers can come up with a more cunning solution.

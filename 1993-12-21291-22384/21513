The article, that was quoted by James Campbell, was from May 1992.
The proof was found (by Wiles) in June 1993, I think.  It is rather long,
100 pages or so.  Therefor one cannot be too sure now, that it is error-free.
But in June 1994 the University of Goettingen (Germany) will have to decide,
if _they_ believe the proof to be valid, and if Wiles has to receive the
famous Wolfskehl Price (once 100000 Goldmark, now after the inflation
between the world wars roughly 1000 DM :-) ).

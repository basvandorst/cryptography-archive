I can't speak about the other sites, but here are some remarks
concerning ours:

1) When specifying our address, please use

	ftp.informatik.uni-hamburg.de

because rzsun2 is just a workstation that happens to handle the ftp
currently. This might change in the future, or it might not.

2) When uploading stuff to our site, please use the directory
/pub/virus/incoming/ and NOT /incoming/ or /pub/incoming/ or whatever.
I am not root on our machine and have the necessary access rights only
to the /pub/virus/ subtree.

3) When uploading stuff here, it is not very useful to make it not
readable by anyone.

4) The author of this particular package wishes that it is not being
distributed outside the USA. Therefore, unfortunately, I am unable to
provide it. The fact whether he can be held legally responsible or not
if I (and not he) distribute the package doesn't really matter - he is
the author, he wishes the package not to be distributed outside the
USA, so I intend to respect his wishes. The situation with RIPEM is
the same - I got it, because RSADSI made it available on their
anonymous ftp site without taking the necessary care to prevent
accidental downloads from outside the USA. However, the author of 
RIPEM wishes that it is not being distributed outside the USA, so I 
am not distributing it.

Regards,
Vesselin

True, but all lines of text are not equally probable.  

This is sci.crypt.  If a cryptosystem encrypted each line, but passed 
through the CRC of the plain text, it would be a serious leak.  If the 
snooper could see the length of the line and the CRC, the snooper could 
look up common short lines like your "No." from a pre-calculated code 
book.  The snooper could keep a data base of communications, and then, 
by matching CRCs, could find places where the plain text is probably 
the same, leaking some potentially useful information.

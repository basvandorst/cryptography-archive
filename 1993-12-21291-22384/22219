I suppose you could construe it any way you want, but I doubt that such a
challenge would hold up in court, any more than the First Amendment argument
helped Howard Stern.  IOW, you can SAY just about anything you want, but you
may be limited WHERE you can say it.  I don't know if it has ever been
tested legally, but I'd suspect that the ability to know the contents of
messages transmitted over the airwaves is part of the FCC's "police powers".

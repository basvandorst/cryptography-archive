   Vocoding, yes, but encryption, no.  With the lies & disinformation put
out by some companies (apparently V-Tech is one), it is understandable
that most of the public doesn't understand the difference.

   Also, it has been reported that the Tropez phones (perhaps just older
ones) throw out a analog-voice spur in the 440MHz area.

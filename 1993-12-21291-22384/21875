   I've been working through Rueppel's _Analysis and Design of Stream
Ciphers_ over the last few weeks, and I was getting quite interested in
whether anyone had done anything serious with Rueppel's suggestions for
using a variation of the knapsack problem to form a one-way function.
Clearly, there are several worst cases where the knapsack function
isn't one-way, but I was wondering if anyone had shown a workable attack
against some simple variation of his knapsack hash function in general.
 
   Have any theoretical results been proven for solving the knapsack
problem when the addition is done (say) modulo 2**32, and then rotated
several bits to the left?  The MD4/MD5/SHA family of one-way hash
functions, and the FEAL cipher family use addition with rotation to
provide nonlinearity....
 
   The discussion of Rueppel's ideas for a synchronous stream cipher
based on the modular knapsack function seemed complete enough to
build a working cipher out of with just a little thought.  If there
haven't been some solid results published against this, I can't
imagine that nobody else has built something like this.

"It has recently been shown by Alford, Granville, and Pomerance that
[the number of Carmichael numbers less than X] is greater than X^(2/7)
for sufficiently large X." - R.G.E. Pinch, "The Carmichael Numbers Up to
10^15".  See Granville, "Primality Testing and Carmichael Numbers,"
Notices American Math Society 39 (1992), pp. 696-700.

Yes, it is feasible but rarely worthwhile.  There are two major problems
with any form of hardware random number generator:

    1) Removing interactions between various components, so that the results
are genuinely independent.

    2) Converting what is a very 'dirty' signal into something with a clean,
known distribution.

However, almost every computer should have a hardware generator to produce
non-predictable starting points for pseudo-random number generators.  This
use does not suffer from the above problems as badly as using entirely the
hardware generator.  Unfortunately, few vendors fit such a device as
standard!

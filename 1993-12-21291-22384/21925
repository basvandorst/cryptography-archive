I don't think it's available via FTP from anywhere due to export
restrictions.   (However I didn't bother to check)  If you can't find it
there you can get it from the author of the program, mikeingle@delphi.com
                               
He will email a uuencoded two part file to anyone in the U.S. or Canada.
It uses the swiss IDEA cypher for encrypting either dos partitions or floppies.

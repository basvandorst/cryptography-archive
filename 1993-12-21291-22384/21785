It's a modern-day myth that there is such a thing
as a "Noise Diode".  No such device exists.

Many people will tell you, "I'm SURE I remember seeing
a datasheet for one in a Motorola catalog, 10 years ago",

    or,

"My brother-in-law's best friend Joe actually BUILT a project
using Noise Diodes",

    or,

"Once I BOUGHT a hundred of these for $1.99 from a mailorder
surplus place."


But the true test is, CAN YOU FIND A DATASHEET FOR A "NOISE DIODE"
IN A SEMICONDUCTOR DATABOOK DATED 1989 OR LATER?   Can you telephone
Hamilton-Avnet or Wyle or Hallmark or Mouser or Digi-Key or
Arrow and order a hundred "Noise Diodes"?  The answer, so far,
is a resounding No.

Therefore, the mythical object called a "Noise Diode" does not
exist.

Of course, you can find datasheets galore for *Zener Diodes*,
and these even contain one or two graphs of their (unwanted)
noise output, and a few paragraphs of explanation including
an introduction to microplasma noise.  But these are Zener Diodes,
intended for voltage references, voltage regulators, and
clamping applications.  They aren't "Noise Diodes."  Newer
model Zeners, like the 1N4614 series and the 1N5518A series,
actually brag about their extremely low levels of noise output.

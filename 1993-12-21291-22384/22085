I would be interested in a dictionary of phrases without regard to word 
divisions.  Things like "on account of", "in order to", just plain 
ordinary phrases, not necessarily cliches or hackneyed expressions, however.

I could use this to create pattern dictionaries to help automate 
solutions of patristocrats (simple substitutions without word divisions), 
Playfairs, and the like.

Anybody else interested?

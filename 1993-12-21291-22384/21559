I am not sure why there is this 'NSA is suppressing PGP' feeling and why
anyone is bothered about it. In the USA/CANADA you can get PEM freely and
outside USA/CANADA there are PEM implementations that fully interwork with
the USA/CANADA implementations.

The main difference between PEM and PGP in this context is the IDEA/DES
part of the relevant protocols. Once either PGP or PEM is regularly used
for email/news even IF they can crack DES/IDEA, the sheer number of messages
makes it very unlikly that they will actually bother to try and crack one
of your messages!

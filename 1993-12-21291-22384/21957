 I'm working from memory but SKey can also work with a hex string (16
 hex digits I think) Is it really easier typing in 16 hex digits than 6
 short words? I doubt it.
 The biggest problem of course is the same as in writing down any
 password- it could be copied/ found by the ENEMY Mind you SKEy is beter
 since any one response is only good for one time, and you can tell if
 someone else has used it ( number decremented) so you can reinitialise
 your passphrase ( assuming of course that you have a seperate skey
 generator on a secure system where you are. )

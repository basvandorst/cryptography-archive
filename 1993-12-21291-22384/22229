It's hard for me to believe that either HamNet or UseNet would
collapse under the weight of all those people just dieing to send an
encrypted copy of the Encyclopedia Britanica to everyone they know.
Heck, the primary practical impediment to using PGP seems to be
finding some other user you know well enough to justify mutual key
signatures!

There is no Usenet restriction against encrypted data, so far as I
know.  I should think the ham restriction is motivated by fear of
espionage or criminal communication.

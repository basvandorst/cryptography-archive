Definite agreement.  Implementational foibles (known so far and yet to be
found) and physical security of the transmission site are the biggest problems.
If someone's really after your information it's nice and easy to break into
your home and sabotage, steal, or bug your stuff than to go for hardcore
crypto attacks.  Of course this assumes they've been watching you long enough
and have enough interest in what you're doing to go after you with this kind of
zeal.  Casual PGP (or other) encrypted communications are probably going to 
slide beneath everyone's notice unless you've drawn attention to yourself
somehow.

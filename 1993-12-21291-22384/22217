mikeb> So, we're talking computer talk here, right?  Like, Radio Packets or
mikeb> something like that?

Probably, yes.

mikeb> How do they know it's encrypted?

Packet has some very specific guidelines and coding techniques.  The FCC
frowns upon using "non-standard" broadcasting techinques in the general
bands, for reasons previously mentioned.

mikeb> You tell them you're sending random test files to someone,

Either a) they'll ask to see the files, or b) fine you for careless and
frivolous broadcasting.

mikeb> or your serial port driver is broken, or something.

Then they /will/ fine you for transmitting with faulty equipment which
could be generating who knows what that it shouldn't.  It is your own
responsibility to make sure your transmission equipment is in good working
order.

mikeb> Is this really a problem?  Am I out of it?

I think so.  The FCC is being really picky-assed about things.  The
bandwidth of 3 years ago is going away, cell-phone companies are trying to
get a bunch of amateur bands converted over for their own use, there's HDTV
entering the 'waves...

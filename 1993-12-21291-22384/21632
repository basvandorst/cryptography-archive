Actually, I heard that the NSA had exercised a mole planted a very very long 
time ago to induce a subtle ( yes, "virtually undetectable" ) change in the
nature of the mu-meson and the proto-quark-prime. ( This last one has not 
yet been discovered by "mainstream science" )  These subtle changes bring
about a predictable ( but virtually undetectable ) interaction between elec-
trons and psion-omega waves.  This means that all P-O waves are transmuted 
by the movement of electrons.  The NSA recently erected a large P-O wave 
emitter in California, Oregon, and Washington State, and a receiver spans the
eastern seaboard.  By deconvolving the P-O wave transfer function at the 
speed of thought, the NSA can actually reconstruct anyone's brain wave patterns
in a small facility disguised as an abandoned drive-in theatre in Newark, NJ.

So what really happened when they arrested the poor political dissenter was 
a simple issue of thought reconstruction, rather than having broken PGP.  PGP's
okay.  Relax.

Think about it.  It explains a lot.  Really.

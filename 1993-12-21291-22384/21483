Didn't you mean ECB rather than CBC?  In CBC, each block of plaintext is
XORed with the ciphertext from the previous block prior to encryption.
Thus, two identical blocks appearing at different locations in the plaintext
file are highly unlikely to produce the same ciphertext.  Furthermore, two
identical blocks of ciphertext are similarly unlikely to have been produced
from identical blocks of plaintext.

How is the knowledge you hypothesize of value?  IOW, if you already know the
contents of a block of plaintext, presumably through non-cryptographic
means, how does identifying additional occurances of it in the plaintext
assist you?  Let's take a simple example, which is likely to occur in a
file much shorter than the 256K byte one you mentioned.  In an
uncompressed MS-DOS ASCII document, four successive blank lines will be
stored as four CR-LF pairs, yielding a 64 bit block of plaintext likely to
be found in even shorter documents.  Now let's say that you knew that the
document began with four blank lines.  How would knowing the locations of
occurances of four blank lines elsewhere in the document benefit you,
cryptographically?

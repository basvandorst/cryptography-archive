Sounds good. I think everyone by now has had a chance to peruse the
Craig Shergold FAQ. If they haven't, I wonder if Ray's axe is up to 
some extra work? But Jerry's mention of *evil* plots by *evil* US 
companies did raise my eyebrow (the left one). The FAQ made no mention. 
What evidence do we have? Or is Jerry starting an AFU UL? (GASP)

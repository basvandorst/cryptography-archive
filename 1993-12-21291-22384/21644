Actually, according to the latest reports from tjhe RSA 129 challenge folks,
they're still some months away from actually factoring the 129-digit modulus.
By late November, they'd found 2 million relations and Paul Leylands guesses
they'll have the factors by the time they hit 8 million, probably some
time next spring.

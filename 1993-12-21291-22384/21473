In my opinion the challenge isn't unfair, as Thomas Krause, the original
poster, has promised to reveal the algorithm, if nobody can find it.

So anybody interested in cracking the cipher _without_ knowing the
algorithm can do so now and the others just have to wait a while until
the algorithm is revealed; then they can judge it from its source code.

(I won't try it either way, because I don't have much experience with
cracking ciphers.  But I am interested in the source anyway.)

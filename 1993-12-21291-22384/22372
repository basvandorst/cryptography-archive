I am evaluating the SecurID authentication system from Security Dynamics.

SD are very cagey about answering questions like "what's the algorithm?".

I don't want to know the exact mathematical details, just things like:

Is there a "secret number" in each card or is it just based on the serial
number?

If there is a "secret number" is this number also held by the server?

Is it also held on file at security dynamics?

What sort of algorithm is used to generate the numbers. An explanation like

"the secret number and the card time are put through a one-way algorithm,
the server does the same thing then a comparison is made"

would be really helpful.

We are also evaluating s/key. Now s/key is, in theory, less secure as it is
subject to password theft/password guessing/trojan horses etc, but at least
the algorithm is known so that the weaknesses can be countered or at least 
assessed. SecurID is inscrutable. How much of the security of SecurID 
relies on Security Dynamics (and all their employees, ex-employees,
office-cleaners etc) keeping the workings of the card and server software
secret? Are SD relying on obscurity for their security?

Anybody know anything?

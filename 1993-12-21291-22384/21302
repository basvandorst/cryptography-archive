But .. given any data file whatsoever, encrypted with a one time pad,
the probability of any string of plain text whatsoever exists, including
that in your original message.  Compression would not change the probability
of some original plaintext being part of the encrypted output, other than
thru the reduction in length it results in.

Of course, any other text is equally likely, including a copy of this line,
or a line from the Declaration of Independence.

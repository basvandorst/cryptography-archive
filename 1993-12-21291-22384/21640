Yes, I am afraid that it is.  The paper is extremely interesting in its links
between the test, information theory and Markov chains, but I am afraid that
universal tests are neither new nor very useful.  It will reject all 'joke'
generators, but not distinguish between poor and adequate ones.

Modern high-quality pseudorandom generators typically have between 100 and
10,000 bits of state, and a period to match.  Unless it is completely
incompetently designed or coded, any generator with 100 bits of state will
pass Maurer's test with 16 bit sections.

I tried Maurer's test on a couple of poor generators that are rejected by
other tests, but it accepted them.  Of course, I tried it with only 16 bits
and not with the 100+ bits that I really needed ....

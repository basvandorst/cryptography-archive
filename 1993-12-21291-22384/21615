If this is true, then how does PGP's four Little Fermat tests of 
primality reduce the risk of getting a pseudo-prime if the pseudo-prime 
is a Carmichael number?  Naively, it seems to me that repeating an 
insufficient test n times just makes the test n times slower without a 
compensating increase in assurance.

Please tell me I misunderstand!

BTW, I would still like an estimate of how difficult it is to get a 
Carmichael number instead of a prime when you begin with a random string 
of digits.

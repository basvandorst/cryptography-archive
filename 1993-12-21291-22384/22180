No.  Even one the best compression methods on arbitrary data, arithmetic
coding, quickly fails all tests of randomness when the sample is still
pretty small, about 100k or more.

So the non-random compression signature which is present will act like
a plain-text crib to quickly test different trial transpositions.

Pre-compression in, say, PGP is still useful though because it saves
space and for very short messages, say 1-50k, the gzip compression
output is hard to prove different from a truly random sample.  So the
plaintext crib is disguised somewhat, making the cryptanalysysts job
a bit more tentative, but not significantly more difficult.

Moral: use precompression if you need to save space, but for resistance to
cryptanalysis, focus on your encryption algorithm.

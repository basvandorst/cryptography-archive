Actually you can buy and sell stereos and anything else over the ham bands
as long as it is a basically private transaction and can be even close to
reasonably construed as a piece of staion equipment. Have you heard any 
swap nets recently. Just about anything goes and I seriously doubt the FCC 
cares a whit. If I can order a pizza I can certailn sell my stereo on the 
swap nets.

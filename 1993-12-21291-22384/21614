Hi.  I can't seem to find the "usuals.h" to match the IDEA code
in the DEC93 DDJ Article.

I also haven't been able to find it in Applied Cryptography
(from which the IDEA article was based.)

Could you post (or E-Mail if improper on this newsgroup) the
usuals.h you used?

(This means you Bruce Schneier.)

Thanks

Thanks for the further publicity!  Perhaps I should say that I used a Sun 3/60
(high-powered? we thought so once) to find the Carmichael numbers up to 10^15.
With a Sparc I got up to 10^16 (there are 246683).  The tables and an offprint 
of my paper in Math. Comp. 61/203 (Jul 1993) 381-3911 can be obtained by FTP at
emu.pmms.cam.ac.uk (131.111.24.1) in directory /pub/Carmichael (please don't
copy the large files during business hours GMT).

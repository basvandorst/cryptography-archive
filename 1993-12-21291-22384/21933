What if I am on your local subnet and can cause some collision at
"just the right time?"  Conceivably, I could "hear" your password but
the host you're logging in to would not, so that I'd have a password
for later use, if you decided next to try another password.  It'd be
nice if this sort of problem could be avoided somehow.  Another poster
mentioned S/Key, and I got the impression S/Key had a similar problem.
(Would the fact that S/Key requires keys to be presented sequentially
help?)  Can anyone suggest a way around this problem?

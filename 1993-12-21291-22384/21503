                 MATHS GANG MAKE FERMAT PRIME SUSPECT
For Cryptographers a Dark Secret Lay in the Number 561, by Keith Devlin

    THE discovery of ever larger prime numbers gets the headlines these
days, but for the professional mathematician such announcements evoke
barely a yawn. After all, back in 350 BC the great Greek mathematician
Euclid proved there are infinitely many prime numbers, so it comes as no
surprise when a new, larger one is found.
    (A prime number is one that can only be evenly divided by itself and
1. Thus, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, and 19 are the prime numbers less than
20. Prime numbers become rarer the higher you go, though by Euclid's
theorem, they never peter out.)
    Far more significant was the discovery earlier this year that there
are infinitely many Carmichael numbers. Credit for this discovery goes
to three mathematicians at the University of Georgia: Englishman Andrew
Granville, formerly of Cambridge University, and Americans Carl
Pomerance and Red Alford. Their discovery represents the final nail in
the coffin for a putative test for prime numbers that goes back to the
great French amateur mathematician Pierre De Fermat.
    On October 18, 1640, in a letter to his colleague Frenicle, Fermat
noted that if P is any prime number, then for any number N that you
choose, P exactly divides NP N. This was a truly remarkable observation
of the "think of a number variety". For example, take the prime number
3. Then, pick any number N you like; raise N to the power 3; then
subtract N. The answer will always be divisible by 3. Suppose you pick
N = 8. Raising 8 to the power 3, you get 512. Subtract 8 from 512 to
give 504. This number 504 is now divisible by 3.
    Or take N = 35. Then 35 = 42875. Subtract 35 and you get 42840.
Again, this number can be evenly divided by 3. Known as Fermat's Little
Theorem (to distinguish it from the famous Fermat's Last Theorem, which
to this day remains unproved), this fact lies behind many common card
tricks where a conjuror will "predict" a chosen card. To mathematicians,
however, the main interest lies in its ability to test for primality. Or
to be more precise, to test for non-primality.
    Primality testing became big business about a decade ago when a
highly secure form of data encryption was developed that makes use of
large prime numbers, prime numbers having a hundred or so digits. For a
number P with a hundred digits, testing to see if P is prime by looking
for numbers that divide into P could take billions of centuries, even
using the world's fastest computers. So mathematicians use other
methods.
    A particularly simple method uses the Fermat Little Theorem. To test
if a number P is prime, see if P divides into 2P 2. If it does not, you
know P cannot be prime. But what happens if P does divide 2P 2? Well,
the chances are that P is prime, but you cannot be sure. The problem is,
though P always divides 2P 2 if P is prime, there are also some non-
prime values for P that have this property; for example, 341 does, and
yet 341 = 11x31, so this number is not prime.
    How about trying a different number, say 3, working out 3P 3? Or 4,
or 5, or 6, or 7, and so on; maybe one of these will work?
Unfortunately, there are some non-prime numbers P for which, whatever
number N you take, NP N is divisible by P. The smallest such is 561
(=3x11x17). These numbers P are called Carmichael numbers, after the man
who, in 1910, found 561 had this property.
    From Carmichael's time, the question was, just how many such numbers
are there? There are none other than 561 below 1,000, and only six more
below 10,000.  There are just 43 less than a million.
    Using high powered computers, a number of mathematicians pushed the
search further and further, with Pinch at Cambridge finding 105,212
Carmichael numbers less than 10 earlier this year. With the discovery of
so many numbers of this kind, it soon became clear that the Fermat
Little Theorem was clearly not suitable to use as a genuine and reliable
test for primality, and in fact the smart money was on there being
infinitely many such numbers, just as there are infinitely many prime
numbers.
    Well, the smart money turned out to be very smart. Using some highly
sophisticated mathematical techniques, what the University of Georgia
team recently discovered is the following strange seeming fact. There is
some number K such that for any number X bigger than K, there are more
than X raised to the power 2/7 Carmichael numbers less than X. Though
the Georgia three have no idea how big this number K is, their
mathematics guarantees such a number exists. Then, since you can make
the number X raised to the power 2/7 as big as you please by choosing X
big enough, it follows that the number of Carmichael numbers must be
infinite.
    Which might be the end of the story. But remember, Euclid's 2,000-
year-old proof that there are infinitely many primes turned out to be
just the start of a long and of late expensive computational odyssey.

I've heard several rumors as to what the circumstances were when
Rivest/Shamir/Adelman developed their public-key algorithm; does anyone
know the "real" story and circumstances (other than them, of course!)?  I
"know" they were at a school at the time, but were they faculty,
hangers-on, or what?  How was their work funded (if at all)?  What was the
timeline for their algorithm, versus ElGamal, etc?

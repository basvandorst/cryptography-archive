Taking square roots mod n (with unknown factorization), ie, solving
x^2=z (mod n) for x given z is as hard as factorization. (if you can
find square roots, you can get the factors fairly easily by (A1)).

So, I could set c=z, b=0, a=0, and solve for x, to get the square
root. So, solving it in general must be at least as hard as factoring.

(A1) Proof [Rabin]: Take sqrt(b^2). If this is not equal to b (if n
has two prime factors, there are 4 possiblities for square roots),
then it is different by an amount divisible by some factors of n. If
the difference contains only one factor of n (50% chance, if n has two
prime factors), then you can take GCD(b-sqrt(b^2),n) to factor n. With
more than 2 factors of n, the same reasoning applies: the
probabilities are different (but still good).

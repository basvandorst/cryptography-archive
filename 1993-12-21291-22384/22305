As I understand it, the Communications Act of 1934 said precisely that, but
I believe that the Electronic Communications Privacy Act amended that to
prohibit interception of cellular (but not cordless) conversations.  Also,
the original 1934 act prohibited any commercial use of any information
gathered from such monitoring, as well as disclosure to a third party
without permission.

I believe that the prohibition on the use of radar detectors by interstate
truckers comes from the DOT, not the FCC.  Undoubtedly they justify it under
the "interstate commerce clause" of the constitution.

Please don't misconstrue my remarks as any sort of endorsement of these
policies, just my explanation, OK?

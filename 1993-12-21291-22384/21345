How do you know that? If it only decrypts a small part (e.g., two
bytes) with a known checksum, this is enough to tell you that the
password si wrong "right away" and it still doesn't have to decrypt
the whole message. Note that I am not saying that it is secure or that
it isn't - just that you can't decide this by just looking at the user
interface.

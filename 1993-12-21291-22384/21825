...I cannot remember exactly where I picked up that TEMPEST is now
declassified - I think it was from a publication by Oceonics SPL who
make a lot of Tempest pretected equipment.  With regard to "standards"
there is no need to meet a formal Tempest spec.  Just look at what the
best receivers around can pull in (ie Dynamic Sciences kit etc) and
leak-stop until you get below it!  There is nothing magical about the
Tempest spec figure - it was quite arbitrary!

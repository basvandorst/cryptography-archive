Forgot to mention: the piece of paper is just one way to store the
passwords.  If the user will be logging in from his own PC, a smart
terminal emulation program could store passwords instead, and send one
when the appropriate prompt goes by or when the user hits a hotkey.
So the user need only mess with the paper when using other people's
terminals.  This makes the system a little more convenient.

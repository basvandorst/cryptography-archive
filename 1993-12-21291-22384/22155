  A query: is there any program that I can give a sequence of encoded
characters (13 characters, both upper and lower case) and what their
decrypted value is, and the program would derive the algorithm?  I mean the
sort of thing where you enter like 50 sequences (more would be possible) and
it gets the encryption meathod?  I just thought it would be an interesting
program for testing out the security of various encryption meathods, or
breaking them.  I'd really appretiate a copy of any program that will do
this, even if just a demo....

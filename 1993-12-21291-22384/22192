???
"Around" would in this case mean "in memory while legitimately accessing 
the disk". (There will be worse things around, like your decrypted data!) 
And picking up a (part of the) hash of the passphrase would only help 
with a dictionary attack; this, however, could be done on the encrypted 
partition anyway. 

Anyway, the reason for the above suggestion was the desire to obtain 
different IVs even if the volume id's of two disks happen to be the same. 
(MessDOS doesn't, afaik, guarantee that they are always different). 
Instead the encryption routine could record a timestamp on the disk when 
the encrypted partition is installed and use this timestamp to obtain 
"unique" IVs for sector-level encryption. It would then be highly improb-
able that two partitions accidentally use the same IVs. 

(And even this is not fatal if randomly generated encryption keys are 
used.)

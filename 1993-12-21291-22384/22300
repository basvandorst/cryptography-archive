The FCC regulations are set up such that a US citizen can receive and
record any legally transmitted signal.  This includes radar detectors and
VCRs, so if FCC regs have the weight of Federal Law then any state or local
regs that say you can't use a radar detector are in conflict with this.
Anyway, the FCC regs do control the /transmission/ of signals.

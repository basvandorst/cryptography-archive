I am interested in generating primitive polynomials over integers mod 2 for
use in constructing linear feedback shift registers used in stream ciphers.
I have a software package that does this (GALOIS) but I want those with a
minimum number of terms to be generated first (eg. x^52+x^3+1,...).
As I need polynomials of degree up to 100 or so it is time consuming to find
primitive polys with 3, 4, etc terms among arbitrary primitive polynomials
of that degree. Can anyone help me with software or tables?

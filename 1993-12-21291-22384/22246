Recently there was a press release that CYCOMM was awarded a contract
by AMSC to provide secure voice (and data?) communications over the
MSAT satellite.  I think that their main customer was going to be
the FBI.  It says in the press release that they will be using
"proprietary encryption" techniques.  Does anyone know what technique
they are using?  It seems strange that they would not be using STU-III
which I don't think could be called proprietary.  If it is STU-III
is it STU-IIID, the digital version.

The problem with sending regular STU-III over the satellite is that
the highest data rate currently supported is 4800 bps asynchronous,
whereas the STU-III uses 4800 sync.  Maybe STU-IIID will support
4800 async? But then it would not be compatible with the installed
base of STU-III phones.

Can anyone deobfuscate me?

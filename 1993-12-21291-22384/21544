I had the distinct impression that Carmicheal numbers were not prime. My
understanding is any prime statisfies

	n^p-n mod p = 0 for any integer n

while this is not true for almost all composite numbers. Those composite
numbers which satisfy the above are clearly interesting and I thought
were called Carmichael numbers.

If I have this wrong could someone clarify the definition of Carmichael
numbers.

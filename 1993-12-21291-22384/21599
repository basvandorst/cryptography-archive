   Could someone familiar with the calculation say what this means for 256,
   512, and 1024 bit RSA keys?

This sounds very much like Harvey Dubner's "cruncher".  The price and
performance is comparable with what he has been saying.  Dubner's board
is a fast arithmetic engine.  It's fine for testing pseudo-primality of
10k- through 100k-bit primes.  Proving primality is much more difficult
unless the primes are of a special form such as n!+1 and k.2^n +/- 1 for
small k.

It means essentially nothing for RSA keys.  Primes that small are easy
to generate and test for pseudo-primality, which is all that RSA
requires.  *Proving* kilobit numbers are prime is not too difficult on a
modern workstation.  Proving 256-bit primes (78 digits) takes about a
minute on a 386 PC with the UBASIC kit obtainable from all good
archives.  300-bit primes takes about 10 minutes; I haven't tried
512-bit primes but expect UBASIC to take an hour or two on my 386DX-25

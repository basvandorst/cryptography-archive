A message digest algorithm.  Since I don't know whether this is enough,
please excuse the next bit if you already understand.

... Signing long messages is difficult in most systems.  In RSA for
instance, the message has to be broken into small blocks and then each
bit signed at the cost of a hell of an overhead.

A message digest is simply a checksum of sorts, dependent on every bit
of the original message.  More importantly, it is considered infeasable
to produce two messages that hash to the same digest.

MD5 = message digest algorithm # 5 and can be obtained by anonymous ftp
from rsa.com

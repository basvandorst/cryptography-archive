Not secure at all.  I don't know if PGP out of the box will decode the
message, but it would be very easy to write a program to put the private
key into a form that PGP will accept.

If the private key file has been erased completely, _nobody_ can decode the
message.  If the owner realized that the pass phrase has been disclosed, he
can retrieve the private key and reencrypt it with a different phrase, then
totally erase the original key file and so long as no copies exist on
backup tapes or whatever, and so long as no one stole a copy of the private
key file (how would you know?), then the file is secure.

A private key is just an integer.  The passphrase encrypted private key
file contains the integer.  Knowing the passphrase does not tell you the
integer unless you have the private key file.  Knowing the integer, you
don't need the private key file:  you can create a new one with a different
pass phrase.

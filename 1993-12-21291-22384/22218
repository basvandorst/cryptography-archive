>BTW, it's not a law, it's an FCC regulation.  They are /not/ the same thing.

FCC Part 97 (Amateur Radio Rules) are as good as law because you agree to 
abide by them (however stupid they may seem) by signing the 610 form and 
getting a Ham licence.  They can take your ticket from you and fine you 
$$$$$$...  In America, when it comes to radio, the FCC is the law.  If 
you don't like it, remeber there is always CB. :)

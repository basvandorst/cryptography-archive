Thursday, 25 November 1993:

All Londoners interested in the issue of communications privacy
should pick up today's *Guardian*: in the Computers section is
an article by Wendy Grossman, "Enter the crypto factor",
subtitled "How computers could give us back the privacy that
computerisation has taken away".

The article discusses the "export problems" at the centre of
Phil Zimmermann's recent troubles.

Good job, Wendy!  [She can be reached, by the way, at

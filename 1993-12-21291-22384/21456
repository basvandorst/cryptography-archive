Are you sure you mean CBC?  In CBC mode, the plaintext xor the
previous block of ciphertext is passed through DES.  I think you might
mean CFB, in which case you're right.

What you say also has some truth with respect to OFB mode, which is
prone to cycles if there are a large number of blocks.  Obviously, if
you've seen a whole cycle you can predict the output of the stream
generator for evermore.

As a general rule, one should always change keys long before
sqrt(keyspace size) blocks have been encrypted.

Andrew.

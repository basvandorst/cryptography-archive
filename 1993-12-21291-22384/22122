The fun place to shop is nic.funet.fi, on the Fnnish University Network.
It's a large archive site for lots of topics, including crypto.
Since it's outside the U.S. government's jurisdiction, there's no
restriction on its contents, though US-written stuff isn't supposed to
be exported and there may be a few programs you can't get outside the U.S.;
most good crypto software does find itself there, however.

Well, if I remember correctly, it was the Department of Transportation.  As
far as enforcement, they might do it like the 55 MPH speed limit itself --
leave enforcement up to the states, with the threat of penalties if they
don't do it well enough.

In some areas, perhaps.  They could probably TRY to prosecute you for using
a CB in that way -- say under the local statute which prohibits "interfering
with a peace officer in the performance of his duty".  I remember a case
here in Riverside, CA many years ago.  A driver went through a radar trap
and got a ticket. He went home (a few blocks away), got a piece of
cardboard, made a sign saying "WARNING- Speed trap ahead".  He parked just
up the road (over a hill) from the cop, displaying his sign. The police
noticed a sudden "wave" of law-abiding motorists, investigated, and arrested
the man with the sign!

I also heard that the "smokeys" had some fun with CBs themselves, in a sort
of "counter-intel" program, too.  They got on THEIR CBs and put out a lot of
FALSE "smokey reports".  After enough "crying wolf", nobody knew which
reports were genuine.  You either had to believe them all, which might mean
keeping it at the "double nickel" the entire length of the state, or else
ignoring them all and taking your chances.  Undoubtedly, the troopers were
violating the law in putting out false reports over the airwaves, of
course...

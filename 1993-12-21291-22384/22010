I want to encrypt some personal data on my PC. The common compression
programs like ARJ or PKZIP offer an encryption as well. Does anybody know what
encryption methods they use and how secure they are? What about PCSECURE (in
PCTOOLS 6.0 )? I was told that the american version of PCSECURE uses another,
stronger method than the european ones. Is that true? 
Could anyone estimate the effort which would be necessary to crack something
encoded by one of these programs with a 9-12 digits password.
Thanks in advance

Gert

The MacRipem RSA certificate is from a "low-assurance" certification
authority. All it says is that the person using it is the same person who
asked for it via e-mail, but there's no guarantee the claimed identity is
the actual one.

The one you get with PowerTalk, and for $25 for additional ones or for
non-Powertalk buyers (first) certificate is a high(er)-assurance
certificate. RSA represents that they've issued it to a person who
demonstrated his identity to the satisfaction of a notary public with three
ID's, at least one of which was a picture ID.

Although that's not perfect, it gives somewhat more assurance to the
recipient.

It's also possible for a company to get a certificate-issuer from RSA which
bears their own name. In such a case they can establish even more rigorous
procedures for certification, and within that community everyone would know
that if you were certified by, say, Chase Manhattan, they actually checked
even more than a Notary. If you were certified by, say, Motorola, then you'd
have to be (let's suppose) a Motorola employee personally known to the
certifier. Thus there are degrees of confidence in these certificates, with
the "free" Ripem one being of fairly low assurance (except for the constancy
of the "identity" of the certified key), with whatever higher degree of
assurance you're willing to pay for.

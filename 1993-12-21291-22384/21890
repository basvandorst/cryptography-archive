I would like to know the difference between CRC and one-way hash
function (message digest function). Is MD5 an extension of CRC i.e
more number of bits or digits. Is there any measure for the level
of security acheived in using a MD5 function. How many bits in the 
hash would make it computationally infeasible (in a practical purpose)
to produce two messages with the same hash function. Also what sort 
of processing power and time is required to generate a practical one
way hash function(this is in view of whether the hash can be computed
in the field).

From my understanding MD5 algorithm and code is availabe as
anonymous ftp. Could someone direct me to the right location (path
& file name if possible) where I can get hold of this. Also I would 
like to kmow more about other one-way hash function algorithms 
available for anon ftp.

Thanks in advance

It is a really ridiculous regulation IMHO because the expressed reason is that it
is makes it impossible to monitor. What percent of ham transmission do you think
are monitored anyway. Thats right go to the head of the class (alomsot none) and
the ones that are probably were due to a complaint. If the station is identified
then I see no problem with encrypted text and would doubt it would pass a first
amendment challange (bad language did not). I am not going to do it sicne I don't
want to be a test case and since I ahve much better ways than the absurd
technology used on the amateur radio bands to pass digital information. I just
think they really don't care.

Pardon me for a second...I just got through with an elementary
statistics class.  This chi square test you're talking about, is that
the expected proportion flavor?

Like:

X^2 = sum of all (observed-expected)^2/expected

?

If so, how are the proportions calculated, like:

pseudo_random_number/sup(all_pseudo_random_numbers_possible)

?

And then, what is your alpha value?  How do you choose?

I hope this can be answered real quickly...I don't want to cause
trouble and bandwidth waste.  (It wasn't in the FAQ).

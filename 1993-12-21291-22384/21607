Query: I'm currently writing a book on literature and cryptography, and 
would like to know if any readers of this group remember having their 
interest in cryptography first picqued through literature -- in particular, 
through stories like Poe's "The Gold-Bug" or Conan Doyle's "The Adventure of 
the Dancing Men."  This was true for a number of important cryptographers 
(notably, Col. William F. Friedman), and I'd like to discover if this is 
still the case, or if cryptography is now only a mathematical subfield.

Any kind of interested response about connections between cryptography and 
literature will be welcome.  If you do not wish to be included in my book by 
name, please mention this in your text, and I will treat it anonymously.  

Thanks in advance.

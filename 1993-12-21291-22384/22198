There are many things the FCC forbids the broadcast of: music over amateur
bands, the infamous "7 words you can't say on TV", etc.  Is it a violation?
In my opinion it is.  Is there anything you can do about it?  Probably not;
the FCC should never have been allowed to make these proscriptions in the
first place.

BTW, it's not a law, it's an FCC regulation.  They are /not/ the same thing.

Try ancient Sumerian methods.  Find a sheep and read it's entrails.  If you
can't find a sheep try a pig.  If no pig try long pig.

	This is already implemented in the form of S/key. You can
FTP it from thumper.bellcore.com, in pub/nmh/skey.

	I suppose the number of independent re-inventions of the
basic S/key idea helps show that it's a good idea. :)

	My only nit about S/key is that I can't figure out why
they used the long word lists (annoying to type) instead of, say,
a 6-digit number. Using a 6-digit number I can print more of my
S/key entries on a page, and it'd look like lottery magic numbers. :)
Typing that whole long string is a drag.

The second block is XORed with the ciphertext from the first block prior to
being encrypted itself.  I'm not sure what what your concern is with the
second block.  You're not thinking of one form of CFB where a different
pseudo-random IV is chosen each time and sent in the clear, are you?  I'm
not sure I understand your point.

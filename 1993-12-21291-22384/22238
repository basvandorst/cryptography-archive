From what I've been able to gather, in theory, the technology exists that
would enable them to break single DES in a reasonable period of time.  While
it's undoubtedly POSSIBLE, no one has claimed it would be easy nor cheap
(nor that they have actually done so). I'd say that given the current state
of computer hardware, even if DES could be broken, such attempts would be
reserved for data with very high perceived value to them.  Unless you are
privy to nuclear secrets or plans for "Aurora" and start sending encrypted
messages to Iran or N. Korea, I'd say that your encrypted correspondence
would not interest them much.

Technology progresses, of course, but I think it's mathematically
established that the users of a cipher will always have the edge over a
potential cracker.  As the complexity of a cipher grows, the difficulty in
cracking it (potentially) grows exponentially.  And faster computers make
more complex cryptosystems feasible.

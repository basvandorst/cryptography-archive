ARJ lightly encrypts the user's password and XORs it cyclically against
the plaintext.  Vesselin said "if known plaintext is available" -- in this
case, just ARJ the known plaintext, XOR against the ciphertext, and the
cyclic key stands naked in front of you -- well, a simple subst of it.

Another "known plaintext" attack on it is for multiple files in the same ARJ
archive: if several files are encrypted with the same key and you have the
plaintext for any of them, you can break the whole thing.  This suggests
that people including a standard file with an encrypted package shouldn't
encrypt it.  Using the same key for -any- two files in the archive weakens
the security of both, of course.

If the encrypted file isn't compressed, it's almost as trivially easy to
break -- a text as long as even a dozen cycles of the key would be plenty,
and you use anti-Vigenere methods, which have been discussed to death here.

I've tried (desultorily) to break a single ARJ-encrypted file, but without
success -- I wasn't able to find enough redundancy in the compressed text.
(This wouldn't be the case with text compressed with 'compress', which has
a great deal of left-over redundancy.)  About a year ago Paul Kocher
reported success with a manual attack in the single-file case, but didn't
recall the details, having done the work a year before that.

This is in addition to the standard password-guessing techniques, of course.

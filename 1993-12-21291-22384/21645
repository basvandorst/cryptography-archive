Hi all,
I think there are at least two ways to get the message without breaking
PGP.
The first one is rather simple.
NSA got the receiver of the message and perhaps the receiver had stored
the decrypted message.
The second is more interesting. I've seen it once in the german TV (serious!!).
It deals with the possibilities and modern methods of security agencies to break
into your privacy.
The guys there had a little transporter-vehicle containing a simple antenna
some electronics and a monitor. The antenna pointed to a monitor in a flat
50-100m (meters) away. With little "snow" they could see everything, which
appears on the screen in the flat.
It is also possible to put a device around your power-supply-cable and to
measure the high frequency. Same result.

Conclusion: 
Throw a dice 1000 times and use vernam or rewrite PGP in FORTH :-).

Come off it.  If you were going to mangle a version of PGP so that it allowed
you to read messages created by it, do *you* think you'd leave in the bit that
tells everyone you'd done that?  I'd certainly ensure that *my* keyid was
left out of the list.

Of course, you could always use a `trusted' version of PGP to do the checking,
but if you've got a trusted version, then why not use it, instead of the 
untrusted version?

Cambridge Security Workshop:  Fast Software Encryption
9-11 December 1993,  Computer Laboratory, Cambridge University

The point of this conference was to facilitate the development of
encryption algorithms suitable for software implementation. 
Attendance was limited to 35 invited people.  Among the three
days of papers, a number of new algorithms were presented:

     SAFER K-64, a 64-bit key 64-bit block cipher, designed by
     James Massey.  It's a byte-oriented algorithm, using
     addition and multiplication mod 256, and exponentiation and
     discrete logarithms in the field GF(257).

     3-WAY, designed by Daemen, Govaerts, and Vanderwalle.  It's
     a block cipher specifically designed to be resistant to
     differential and linear cryptanalysis.

     The basics of a block cipher by Kaliski and Robshaw at
     RSADS.  This algorithm uses many of the cryptographic
     techniques from MD4/MD5.  It encrypts data in blocks of 1
     kbyte.

     Some implementation of the shrinking generator, first
     presented at Crypto this year, by Krawczyk.

     A modern variant of the classic rotor machine, by Ross
     Anderson.

     SEAL, a variable-key-length pseudo-random stream generator
     by Rogaway and Coppersmith.  This is the fastest algorithm
     presented, encrypting data in 5 clock cycles per byte.

     A fast block encryption algorithm by David Wheeler.

     A variable-length-key 64-bit block algorithm by me that
     encrypts data in about 30 clock cycles per byte.  I designed
     this algorithm to be the fastest possible Feistel network. 
     It has the maximum avalanche possible under the structure,
     and is resistant to both linear and differential
     cryptanalysis because the S-boxes are key-dependent.

     A 64-bit block cipher with a 128-bit key by Porto and
     Wolfowicz.

The point of this conference was to provide targets for
cryptanalysis, and in that respect it was successful.  To me the
most interesting things were not the details of the algorithms
themselves, but the design criteria that people used.  Many
algorithms consisted a two parts:  a complex and slow subkey
generation phase, which took a key and expanded it into a large
array of (sometimes as much as 4 kbytes) of subkeys.  Everyone
made their algorithm efficient on 32-bit microprocessors.

Springer-Verlag will publish the proceedings sometime this year. 
And hopefully people will start attacking the ciphers.  Someone
suggested booking odds on the various ciphers.  I have my
suspicions on which are likely to fall first; the general
consensus was that two or three will be broken by the same time
next year.  If we are going to have a free and secure algorithm
by the end of the century, we are going to have to start working
on one now.

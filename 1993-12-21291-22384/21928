S > The statement about "C" compilers being written to "recognize" PGP 

Why not simply use a "C" compiler that is NOT USA in origin? If one 
acquired a compiler from Russia or China or Australia, perhaps the 
whole problem would disappear, if such a compiler exists?  Somehow, I 
cannot believe that the influence of the US govt extends that far re 
"C" compilers.  If one does not exist, simply write one and put it on 
the market.  Would be interesting to see what would then happen... :-)

My opinions are my own... and the above is a bit tongue in cheek, but 
would solve the problem... me thinks.

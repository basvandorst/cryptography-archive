I am interested in decoding VCRPlus codes, and the FAQ in sci.crypt
directed me to an article in the journal Cryptologia.  The local
university library doesn't hold this journal, and won't do an
inter-library loan for me as I am only an alumnus, not a current student.

If anyone has access to the following article, and would be willing to
xerox a copy and mail it to me please email me for an address.  Your help
will be appreciated.

227--234, 1992.

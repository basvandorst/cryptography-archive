Yes.  See earlier posts from here, Koblitz's book, etc.  Almost
all composite numbers fail this test with every base.

For experimental results, see Rivest's paper which I think was
in Crypto 90 or 91 or maybe Eurocrypt for one of those years.
He generated several million random 256-bit numbers and tested them
for pseudoprimality with base 2.  Not a single number reported
as pseudoprime turned out to be composite (using Miller-Rabin).

I vaguely remember seeing that polynomial bound on the frequency of
Carmichael numbers, but it was polynomial in the number of digits
(i.e. the log of the number).  Carmichael numbers are quite rare.

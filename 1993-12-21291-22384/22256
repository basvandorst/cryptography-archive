Yeh.  Now its VERBOTEN to receive it.  Even banned receivers capable
of doing so.  I have no problem with encryption/scrambling, but I
have a BIG problem with saying you cannot receive a given frequency.
Hell, it is received by any conductor anyway.  But you cannot have
a circuit tuned to it, or demodulate it.

That is a dangerous precident on a resource 'owned by everyone'.

I guess its owned by 'everone' until the FCCt can sell it to someone
with enough money to turn their heads...  apparantly the cellular
phone lobby represents people with enough money.

Encryption would have solved the problem.  WITHOUT Yet Another Ban
for everyone (except the state, of course...)

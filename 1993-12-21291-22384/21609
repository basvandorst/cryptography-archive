I posted yesterday that it was possible to break PGP encoded message
using only the secring, and not using the passphrase. In talking to the
associate who said he could do this, I became very misinformed, when in
fact my associate said it was NOT posssible to break a PGP encoded message
with only the secring.

I apologize for this misinformation, and I hope noone became paniced
because of it.

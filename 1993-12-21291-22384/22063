Thanks to Jim Gillogy for the detailed explanation and Vesselin
Vladimirov Bontchev for the follow up details on the ARJ encryption
question.

Also, thanks to all those who e-mailed me with words of wisdom... I
am just getting into crpytology (last 6 months) and I know I have much
to learn.  I do find the vasts of info here very intelectually 
stimulating.  :)

Thanks again!

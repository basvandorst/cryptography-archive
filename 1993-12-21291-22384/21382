  You assume incorrectly. In PGP, the message is encrypted *once* using
the IDEA algorithm and a random 128-bit session key. The session key
is then encrypted once for each recipient, using the recipient's
RSA public key. So, the encrypted message grows by (16+m) bytes for
each added recipient, where 'm' is the keyID overhead, not by N, the
message size.

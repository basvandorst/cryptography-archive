I have difficulty believing that stub calls to encryption code violates 
2778 and the ITAR!  IBM's PROFS I know for a fact has such stubs in it.  
I have never heard of any export problems for that product.  My 
impression is that there are many products that use stub calls so that 
they do not run into the ITAR restrictions.

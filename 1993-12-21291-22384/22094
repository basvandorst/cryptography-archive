The Part-of-Speech list won't help your problem, I was answering
another query that I got in e-mail in response to your question.
Apologies for the confusion. Since the POS list provides another 
'projection' of the English language it can be used to further pare
down the possible choices of a parse.  My experience suggests that
using another language projection converges more quickly on the authentic
model than further refining a single projection, such as word frequencies.

Although the National Security Agency *is* a customer for the POS list,
as I discovered when matching zip+4's one day...wonder what they are doing
with it.

(negative disclaimer: I do this for a living)

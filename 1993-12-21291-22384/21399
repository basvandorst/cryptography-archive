In article <2csqda$k9d@rzsun02.rrz.uni-hamburg.de>, Vesselin Bontchev
<bontchev@fbihh.informatik.uni-hamburg.de> posts one of his typical derisory
messages containing no useful information at all, and seemingly designed to
show how clever he is. This is sci.crypt, and a serious question was asked.
Since Vesselin has no information, he adds noise and supercilious contumely
to the channel instead. He used to do this to my messsages, but by his
current message he makes it clear that it's him, not us. If not for his
occasional substantive posts, he'd be long gone the way of Mutlu.

The reader asked whether NSA can crack PGP. There are only four answers
consistent with the charter of this group, only three of which are postable.
They are: Yes (with details)    postable
          No  (with details)    postable
          I don't know          a waste of bandwidth
          A theoretical calculation, perhaps accompanied with remarks on the
          factoring problem and on IDEA, as some have supplied

The latter is best of all.

Bontchev's political b.s. is worst of all on sci.crypt as users have asked
that it be. If Vesselin wants to post arrogant noises, I believe many
users would like them posted to talk.politics.crypto, but not crossposted to
sci.crypt.

Followups as indicated.

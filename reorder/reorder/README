Here is the remailing code that I use with nately.
I call "mail-reorder" from cron every ten minutes.
Rather than piping incomming mail to the remailer, it should
be piped to the script "mail-in"

You must edit mail-in, mail-out and mail-reorder, telling
where to store the files, and what programs to call.

mail-reorder and mail-out both move all the waiting files into
outgoing. mail-out then sends all the messages to the remailer,
in order. mail-reorder chooses the messages randomly, leaving
maxpool in the outgoing directory.

You need to compile rnd (just make in the Rnd directory).
Put put the rnd program in a directory on your path, or put its path in
mail-reorder where it is called.
rnd is a random number generator using RC4.

WARNING!
	If you plan to use this package to handle incoming mail
	for Mixmaster *AND* to reorder type 1 messages, then you
	must have two copies of this package, one for each purpose.
	Incoming mail would be sent to the first "reorder" package, e.g..

	   "|/home/myacct/reorder1/mail-in"

	In "mixmaster.conf" you would set 

	   TYPE1		/home/myacct/reorder2/mail-in

	The crontab would have entries for both
	/home/myacct/reorder1/mail-out
	and
	/home/myacct/reorder2/mail-reorder

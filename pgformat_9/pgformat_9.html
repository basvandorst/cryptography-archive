<H2>Signature packet</H2>
<PRE>
Offset  Length  Meaning
0       1       CTB for secret-key-encrypted (signed) packet
1       2       16-bit (or maybe 8-bit) length of packet
3       1       Version byte (=2).  May affect rest of fields that follow.
                Version byte (=3) for &gt;= PGP2.6 after 9/1/94
4       1       Length of following material that is implicitly included 
                in MD calculation (=5).
5       1       Signature classification field (see below). 
                Implicitly append this to message for MD calculation.
6       4       32-bit timestamp of when signature was made.  
                Implicitly append this to message for MD calculation.
10      8       64-bit Key ID
18      1       Algorithm byte for public key scheme (RSA=0x01).  
                --Algorithm byte affects field definitions that follow.
19      1       Algorithm byte for message digest (MD5=0x01).
20      2       First 2 bytes of the Message Digest inside the 
                RSA-encrypted integer, to help us figure out if we 
                used the right RSA key to check the signature.
22      ?       RSA-encrypted integer, encrypted message digest
                (MPI with bitcount prefix).
</PRE>
If the plaintext that was signed is included in the same file as the
signature packet, it begins right after the RSA secret-key-signed
packet that contains the message digest.  The plaintext has a
<I>literal</I> CTB prefix.
<P>The original idea had a variable length field following the length
of following material byte, before the Key ID.  In particular, the
possibility of a 2-byte validity period was defined, although no
previous version of PGP ever generated those bytes.
<P>Owing to the way the MD5 is computed for the signature, if that field
is variable length, it is possible to generate two different messages
with the same MD5 hash.  One would be a file of length N, with a 7-byte
following section consisting of a signature type byte, 4 bytes of
timestamp, and 2 of validity period, while the other would be a file of
length N+2, whose last two bytes would be the siganture type byte and
the first byte of timestamp, and the last three bytes of timestamp and
the validity period would instead be interpreted as a signature type
byte and a timestmap.
<P>It should be emphasized that the messages are barely different and
special circumstances must arise for this to be possible, so it is
extremely unlilely that this would be exploitable, but it is a
potential weakness.  It has been plugged by allowing only the currently
implemented 5-byte option.  Validity periods will be added later with
a different format.
<P>The signature classification field describes what kind of 
signature certificate this is.  There are various hex values:
<PRE>
        00 -    Signature of a message or document, binary image.  
        01 -    Signature of a message or document, canonical text.  
        10 -    Key certification, generic.  Only version of key
                certification supported by PGP 2.5.
                Material signed is public key pkt and User ID pkt.
        11 -    Key certification, persona.  No attempt made at all 
                to identify the user with a real name.
                Material signed is public key pkt and User ID pkt.
        12 -    Key certification, casual identification.  Some
                casual attempt made to identify user with his name.
                Material signed is public key pkt and User ID pkt.
        13 -    Key certification, positive ID.  Heavy-duty
                identification efforts, photo ID, direct contact 
                with personal friend, etc.
                Material signed is public key pkt and User ID pkt.
        20 -    Key compromise.  User signs his own compromise
                certificate.  Independent of user ID associations.
                Material signed is public key pkt ONLY.
        30 -    Key/userid revocation.  User can sign his own 
                revocation to dissolve an association between a key
                and a user ID, or certifier may revoke his previous 
                certification of this key/userid pair. 
                Material signed is public key pkt and User ID pkt.
        40 -    Timestamping a signature certificate made by someone
                else.  Can be used to apply trusted timestamp, and
                log it in notary's log.  Signature of a signature.
                (Planned, not implemented.)
</PRE>
When a signature is made to certify a key/UserID pair, it is computed
across two packets--the public key packet, and the separate User ID
packet.  See below.  
<P>The packet headers (CTB and length fields) for the public key packet
and the user ID packet are both omitted from the signature
calculation for a key certification.  
<P>A key compromise certificate may be issued by someone to revoke his
own key when his secret key is known to be compromised.  If that
happens, a user would sign his own key compromise certificate with
the very key that is being revoked.  A key revoked by its own
signature means that this key should never be used or trusted again,
in any form, associated with any user ID.  A key compromise
certificate issued by the keyholder shall take precedence over any
other key certifications made by anyone else for that key.  A key
compromise signed by someone other than the key holder is invalid.  
<P>Note that a key compromise certificate just includes the key packet
in its signature calculation, because it kills the whole key without
regard to any userid associations.  It isn't tied to any particular
userid association.  It should be inserted after the key packet,
before the first userid packet.  
<P>When a key compromise certificate is submitted to PGP, PGP will place
it on the public keyring.  A key compromise certificate is always
accompanied in its travels by the public key and userIDs it affects.
If the affected key is NOT already on the keyring, the compromise
certificate (and its key and user ID) is merely added to the keyring
anywhere.  If the affected key IS already on the keyring, the
compromise certificate is inserted after the affected key packet. 
This assumes that the actual key packet is identical to the one
already on the key ring, so no duplicate key packet is needed.
If a key has been revoked, PGP will not allow its use to encipher any
messages, and if an incoming signature uses it, PGP will display a
stern warning that this key has been revoked.
<P>NOTE:  Key/userid revocation certificates ARE NOT SUPPORTED in
this version of PGP.  But if we ever get around to supporting them,
here are some ideas on how they should work...
<P>A key/userid revocation certificate may be issued by someone to
dissolve the association between his own key and a user ID.  He would
sign it with the very key that is being revoked.  A key/userid
revocation certificate issued by the keyholder shall take precedence
over any other key certifications made by anyone else for that
key/userid pair.  Also, a third party certifier may revoke his own
previous certification of this key/userid pair by issuing a
key/userid revocation certificate.  Such a revocation should not
affect the certifications by other third parties for this same
key/userid pair. 
<P>When a key/userid revocation certificate is submitted to PGP, PGP
will place it on the public keyring.  A key/userid revocation
certificate is always accompanied in its travels by the public key it
affects (the key packet and user ID packet precedes the revocation
certificate).  If the affected key is NOT already on the keyring, the
revocation certificate (and its key and user ID) is merely added to
the keyring anywhere.  If the affected key IS already on the keyring,
the revocation certificate is integrated in with the key's other
certificates as though it were just another key certification.  This
assumes that the actual key packet is identical to the one already on
the key ring, so no duplicate key packet is needed.

Here is a version of unshar that I have `knocked up' in the past few weeks.
It isn't as flash as the standard unshar, but I've made it modular so it
can be enhanced easily.

However, it has some advantages:

	- it does not call any other program, especially /bin/sh
	- it can extract specific files from the shar
	- can give a table of contents without extracting files
	- takes several input files, or the standard input
	- ignores leading `junk' e.g news headers
	- emulates sed, gres and cat to do the unsharing
	- avoids the Minix `cat /dev/null > file' problem :-)
	- it works `as is' under MS-DOS (needs getopt)

I've used it to unshar lots of different files; there are bound to be
some that it can't extract, but fixing the program should be easy.

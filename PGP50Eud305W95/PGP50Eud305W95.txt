PGP Plug-in for the Windows 95 PGP 5.0 Freeware prgoram, for use
with Eudora Light 3.05

Notes: the Eudora plug-in for Eudora that comes with PGP 5.0 will
work with Eudora 3.03, but (often) not with Eudora 3.05. the PGP 5.0
version that comes bundled with Eudora Light 3.05 only recognizes
DSS keys, and will not encode/decrypt to RSA keys.

Workaround: 

1) download PGP50Eud305W95.zip - it contains the PGP 5.0 plug-in that
   will work with Eudora Light 3.05

2) Install Eudora Light 3.05 for Win 95

3) Install PGP 5.0 for Win 95 Freeware version (if you have not already
   done so)

4) replace the pgpplugin.dll found in the ...EUDORA/PLUGINS directory
   with the plug-in contained in PGP50Eud305W95.zip

you should now have RSA/DSS PGP functionality in Eudora Light 3.05

more notes: 

1) I'm assuming this also works with Eudora Pro, but I haven't tried it.

2) you may have to re-install PGP 5.0 Freeware, and then replace the PGP
   plug-in contained in PGP50Eud305W95.zip.

3) since this is the freeware version, you can use, but not generate, 
   RSA keys.

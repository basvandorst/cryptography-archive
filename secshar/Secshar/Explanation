Subject: Secshar instructions
Status: R

Here is the basic idea. To split the secret n ways, the program generates a
polynomial of degree n-1

f(x) = (A + Bx + Cx^2 + Dx^3 + ... + Nx^(n-1)) Mod z

z is prime, and larger than any of the coeficiants, and larger than n.
A is the secret to be shared (in my program this is done one byte at a time).
All the other coeficients are chosen randomly.
The shares are simply this function evaluated at some point.
Each share consists of an x value and f(x):
1 f(1)
2 f(2)
.
.
.
m f(m)

>From simple linear algebra, it takes n equations to solve for the n unknowns
A - N. Any less gives no information.

So and n of the shares can be used to solve for all of the coeficiants, of which
the first is the secret.

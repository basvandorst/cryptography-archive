1. Scope

This standard describes a syntax for private-key
information. Private-key information includes a private key
for some public-key algorithm and a set of attributes. The
standard also describes a syntax for encrypted private keys.
A password-based encryption algorithm (e.g., one of those
described in PKCS #5) could be used to encrypt the private-
key information.

The intention of including a set of attributes is to provide
a simple way for a user to establish trust in information
such as a distinguished name or a top-level certification
authority's public key. While such trust could also be
established with a digital signature, encryption with a
secret key known only to the user is just as effective and
possibly easier to implement. A non-exhaustive list of
attributes is given in PKCS #9.

3. Definitions

For the purposes of this standard, the following definitions
apply.

AlgorithmIdentifier: A type that identifies an algorithm (by
object identifier) and any associated parameters. This type
is defined in X.509.

ASN.1: Abstract Syntax Notation One, as defined in X.208.

Attribute: A type that contains an attribute type (specified
by object identifier) and one or more attribute values. This
type is defined in X.501.

BER: Basic Encoding Rules, as defined in X.209.


4. Symbols and abbreviations

No symbols or abbreviations are defined in this standard.


5. General overview

The next two sections specify private-key information syntax
and encrypted private-key information syntax.

This standard exports two types: PrivateKeyInfo (Section 6)
and EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo (Section 7).


6. Private-key information syntax

This section gives the syntax for private-key information.

Private-key information shall have ASN.1 type
PrivateKeyInfo:

PrivateKeyInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
  version Version,

  privateKeyAlgorithm PrivateKeyAlgorithmIdentifier,
  privateKey PrivateKey,
  attributes [0] IMPLICIT Attributes OPTIONAL }

Version ::= INTEGER

PrivateKeyAlgorithmIdentifier ::= AlgorithmIdentifier

PrivateKey ::= OCTET STRING

Attributes ::= SET OF Attribute

The fields of type PrivateKeyInfo have the following
meanings:

     o    version is the syntax version number, for
          compatibility with future revisions of this
          standard. It shall be 0 for this version of the
          standard.
          
     o    privateKeyAlgorithm identifies the private-key
          algorithm. One example of a private-key algorithm
          is PKCS #1's rsaEncryption.
          
     o    privateKey is an octet string whose contents are
          the value of the private key. The interpretation
          of the contents is defined in the registration of
          the private-key algorithm. For an RSA private key,
          for example, the contents are a BER encoding of a
          value of type RSAPrivateKey.
          
     o    attributes is a set of attributes. These are the
          extended information that is encrypted along with
          the private-key information.
          

7. Encrypted private-key information syntax

This section gives the syntax for encrypted private-key
information.

Encrypted private-key information shall have ASN.1 type
EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo:

EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
  encryptionAlgorithm EncryptionAlgorithmIdentifier,
  encryptedData EncryptedData }

EncryptionAlgorithmIdentifier ::= AlgorithmIdentifier

EncryptedData ::= OCTET STRING

The fields of type EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo have the
following meanings:

     o    encryptionAlgorithm identifies the algorithm under
          which the private-key information is encrypted.
          Two examples are PKCS #5's pbeWithMD2AndDES-CBC
          and pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC.
          
     o    encryptedData is the result of encrypting the
          private-key information.
          
The encryption process involves the following two steps:

     1.   The private-key information is BER encoded,
          yielding an octet string.
          
     2.   The result of step 1 is encrypted with the secret
          key to give an octet string, the result of the
          encryption process.

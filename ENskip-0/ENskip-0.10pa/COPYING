			ENskip Public License
			=====================

This is the ENskip public License, strongly influenced by the GNU Library
License V 2.0. Whenever the ENskip License does not address a certain point,
you may feel free to act according to the GNU Library License V 2.0 or, at
your wish, any later version.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of ENskip's complete source 
code as you receive it, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately 
publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of 
warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the 
absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with 
ENskip.

  2. You may not charge any fee for the distribution of ENskip, other than a
reasonable amount to compensate for the physical act of transferring a copy.

  3. You may modify your copy or copies of ENskip or any portion of it, thus 
forming a work based on ENskip, and copy and distribute such modifications 
or work under the terms of this License, provided that you cause the files 
modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and 
the date of any change. You are encouraged to notify the authors of ENskip
(skip@tik.ee.ethz.ch) about your changes.

  4. You may copy and distribute ENskip or a derivative of it, under the 
condition that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-
readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of this 
License, or point to a place where the person receiving your distribution 
of ENskip may reliably receive the machine-readable source code without 
additional costs other than a reasonable amount for the actual transfer of 
the data. 
  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a 
designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code 
from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code,
even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with 
the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of ENskip, but 
is designed to work with ENskip by interacting with its run-time components,
is called a "work that uses ENskip".  Such a work, in isolation, is not a 
derivative work of the ENskip, and therefore falls outside the scope of this 
License.

  6. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, execute, use, or distribute
ENskip  except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt 
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, execute, use, or distribute ENskip 
is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this 
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties 
remain in full compliance.

  7. Each time you redistribute ENskip (or any work based on ENskip), the 
recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to 
copy, distribute, execute, use or modify ENskip subject to these terms and 
conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'
exercise of the rights granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing
compliance by third parties to this License.

  8. Commercial exploitation of a product based on this work or a derivative 
of it except as provided by section 5) of this License is expressly forbidden 
unless you receive written consent by the copyright holders of this work.

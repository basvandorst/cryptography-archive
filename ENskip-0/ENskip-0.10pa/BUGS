Remember: This is the first release of ENskip (pre-alpha 0.10).

Various things have to be fixed/done, known problems:
- The IP reassembly code is not yet done. If ENskip refuses to communicate
  you can try to reduce the MTU size to avoid fragmentation. Fragments
  are currently dropped.
- Unload of the kernel modules can cause race conditions if an IPSP packet
  is processed at the same time. You CAN unload, but be warned.
- Only manual keying is implemented.
- Sequencing prevents reestablishing communication once one machine
  reinitializes ENskip. The SKIP protocol has to be adapted to solve this.
- Skipd has to be started before skip_attach is done (otherwise skipd can't 
  be loaded from an NFS server any more).
- Solaris ENskip breaks TCP connections on stop/start.

System dependent problems:
Sun SparcStation20 / Solaris 2.4 (Ethernet):
- TCP connections can break when unloading/ reloading the kernel module.

Silicon Graphics Indy / IRIX 5.3 (Ethernet/PPP):
- IRIX 5.3 problems with NFS to Nextstep. (origin of this error could not 
  be traced, might be an IRIX problem)
- Occasional crash with PPP.

NeXT Colorstation / Nextstep 3.2 (Ethernet):
- ENskip does not work on (black) NeXT hardware, when used on an ethernet 
  interface.  This is caused by a problem with the DMA buffer alignment. 
  ENskip should work over ppp or other non DMA dependant devices.

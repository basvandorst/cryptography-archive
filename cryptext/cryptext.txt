Subject: Win95 / NT4 encryption shell extension

I have updated the Win95 / NT4 file encryption shell extension on my web
page at http://www.pcug.org.au/~njpayne. It uses SHA-1 to generate a
160-bit key from a passphrase and IV, and RC4 to encrypt using that key.
The IV for each file is different, so no two files are encrypted using the
same keystream. There is a fuller explanation on the web page. I have also
included the source code for a decryption program to enable verification of
the implementation.

It's also free. Distribute it anywhere you like.

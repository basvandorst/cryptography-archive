This is a patch against the "Michael Elkins extended" version of ELM.
I made this patch at Sameer Parekh's request.  Unfortunately, I am
unable to communicate this patch back to the main site for this
distribution, because it is outside of the United States.

Interested parties may retrieve this modified version of ELM from:

  ftp.ozone.fmi.fi:/KEH/

This patch was generated against version 2.4.ME+.35.

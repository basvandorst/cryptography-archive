Contained in this directory are patches and instructions for
integrating PGP 5.0 with some popular mail programs.

I personally use mutt (available from http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~me/mutt/),
with the patch in this directory for my email, and can recommend it to
anyone seeking PGP/MIME operation and a good mailer, to boot.

For more information and updates (or, if you are an author with a
program that works with PGP 5.0), see:

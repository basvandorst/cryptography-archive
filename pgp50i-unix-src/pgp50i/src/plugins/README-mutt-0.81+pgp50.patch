The code in this patch was originally written by Michael Elkins.  I
modified it to work with PGP 5.0, and added keyserver support.  This
patch should be applied against the NON PGP version of mutt
(mutt-0.81e.tar.gz).

This patch has one known bug - the screen update is not correct if a
key is fetched from the server.

Unlike the rest of this distribution, this patch is released under the
same terms as mutt version 0.81 (namely, the GNU Public License).

You can get this license (and mutt) at:

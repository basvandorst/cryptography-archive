While I have not had the opportunity to modify any PINE packages, the
latest versions of PINE makes it quite easy to integrate PGP 5.0 for
simple operations.  Special thanks go to Craig Leikis for this
suggestion:

Go into the Setup/Config section ("S" from the main menu, then "C").
Scroll to the bottom (the space bar).  Two of the last options are
"display-filters" and "sending-filters."  Set them as follows:

display-filters = _BEGINNING("-----BEGIN PGP")_ /usr/local/bin/pgpv +OutputInformationFD=1
sending-filters = /usr/local/bin/pgpe -ast -r _RECIPIENTS_

Note that the "display-filters" value is all one line.  As pgpv
automatically adds any keys it encounters, this will also add
correspondants' keys to your keyring.  If you do not desire this
behavior, add "-K" to the pgpv command line.

This is known to work with Pine version 3.95.

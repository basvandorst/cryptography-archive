Hello,

Following is the Pascal source code for solving monoalphabetic substitution
using probabilistic relaxation.  Note that it uses software functions
SAFE_MULT and SAFE_DIV to check for underflow.  You may be able to get by
without these depending on your machine.

The reference to this program and input data is:

King, J., D. Bahler.  "An implementation of probabilistic relaxation in the
cryptanalysis of simple substitution ciphers."  Cryptologia 16(3):215-225.
July 92.

I've reimplemented the algorithm in C and extended it to solve polyalphabetic
ciphers.  Also developed another algorithm to take the output from relaxation
and to determine to one-to-one mapping to obtain a 100% decryption.  This
has been submitted to Cryptologia and I will make the code available later.

I'm sending you an input, output, a source code file.  They were first
compressed and uuencoded.

Regards,

John King

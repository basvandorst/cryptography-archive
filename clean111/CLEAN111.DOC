          SYNOPSIS

               CLEAN-UP (CLEAN) is a virus disinfection program for IBM PC
          and compatible computers.  CLEAN searches through the partition
          table, boot sector, or files of a PC to remove viruses specified
          by the user.  In most instances, CLEAN repairs infected areas
          of the system, restoring them to their pre-infected state.
          CLEAN removes all viruses identified by the current version of
          VIRUSCAN.  CLEAN can also remove new or unknown viruses using
          recovery information stored by SCAN [See VIRUSCAN's
          documentation for details].
               CLEAN runs on any PC with 480Kb and DOS 2.00 or above.


          AUTHENTICITY

               CLEAN performs a self-test when run.  If CLEAN has been
          modified in any way, a warning will be displayed.  However,
          CLEAN is still able to remove viruses.  If CLEAN reports it
          has been damaged, a new, undamaged copy should be obtained.
               CLEAN is packaged with VALIDATE, a program to check
          the integrity of CLEAN.EXE.  The VALIDATE.DOC file explains
          its usage.  The VALIDATE program distributed with CLEAN may
          be used to check new versions for tampering or damage.

               The validation results for Version 111 should be:

          FILENAME:     SIZE:      DATE:        CHECK METHOD:

          CLEAN.EXE     192,959    1-14-94     M1: 1969  M2: 0E47

          If your copy of CLEAN.EXE differs, it may have been modified.
          Always obtain CLEAN from a known source.  The latest version of
          CLEAN and validation data can be obtained from McAfee
          Associates' BBS at (408) 988-4004, from the McAfee Virus Help
          Forum on CompuServe (GO MCAFEE), by anonymous ftp from the
          mcafee.COM site on the Internet, and from the McAfee area on
          America Online.

               All of McAfee Associates' programs are archived with
          Version 2.04g of PKWare's PKZIP Authentic File Verification.
          When unzipped with Version 2.04g of PKWare's PKUNZIP program,
          an "-AV" will be displayed after each file is unzipped and an
          "Authentic files Verified!   # FZW807  McAFEE  ASSOCIATES" will
          appear once all files are unzipped.

          NOTE:  If you do not receive the Authentic File Verification
                 messages, you may be using a different version of
                 PKUNZIP, such as V1.10 or 1.93A.  Use PKUNZIP Version
                 2.04g to unzip files if you wish to have Authenticity
                 Verification displayed as files are unzipped.

          WHAT'S NEW

               Version 111 replaces Version 109.  Version 110 was only
          used for beta-testing.  This release adds disinfection of six
          viruses:  the 592, Ganeu, Khobar, Spanish Holidays, Thriller,
          Unbx, and Volkov viruses.

               Beginning with Version 111, all files are now archived
          with PKZIP Version 2.04g.

               CLEAN displays messages in English (default); refer to
          APPENDIX C for information on displaying messages in other
          languages.

               Please refer to the enclosed VIRLIST.TXT file for a short
          description of the new viruses.  For more detailed descriptions,
          please refer to Patricia Hoffman's virus summary listing (VSUM).


          OVERVIEW

               CLEAN searches the system for viruses to remove.  When an
          infected file is found, CLEAN isolates and removes the virus and
          in most cases repairs the infected file and restores it to
          normal operation.  If the file is infected with an uncommon
          virus, CLEAN displays a warning message asking whether to
          overwrite and delete the infected file.  Erased files are non-
          recoverable.
               Before running CLEAN, verify the infection with VIRUSCAN.
          SCAN will locate and identify the virus and provide the I.D.
          code used by CLEAN.  The I.D. is displayed inside the square
          brackets, "[" and "]."  For example, the I.D. code for the
          Jerusalem virus is displayed as "[Jeru]".  This I.D. must
          be used with CLEAN to remove the virus.  The square brackets
          "[" and "]" MUST be included.
               If SCAN finds an unknown virus in a file that has had
          validation or recovery data stored for it, it will warn that an
          infection has occurred.  It will not, however,  display an I.D.
          code.

               NOTE:  When CLEAN is run with the /GENERIC or /GRF options
                      to disinfect files or system areas based on recovery
                      information stored by SCAN, no I.D. code should be
                      used.

               Please refer to the VIRUSCAN documentation for instructions
          in adding recovery information to your system.

          AN IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT .EXE FILES:  Some viruses damage .EXE
          files when they infect them if the .EXE file loads overlays
          internally.  CLEAN will truncate sich files when cleaning
          them.  If a file no longer runs after being cleaned, replace
          it from the original disk or virus-free backups.

          AN IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT PARTITION TABLE VIRUSES (e.g., Stoned):
          Removing a partition table virus such as the Stoned virus
          can cause loss of the partition table on systems partitioned
          with third-party disk partition programs.  As a precaution, back
          up all critical data before running CLEAN.  Loss of the partition
          table can result in the LOSS OF ALL DATA ON THE DISK.

          OPERATION and OPTIONS

          IMPORTANT NOTE:  TURN OFF YOUR PC AND BOOT FROM A CLEAN DOS
                           SYSTEM-BOOTABLE DISK BEFORE BEGINNING.  RUN
                           CLEAN FROM A WRITE-PROTECTED DISK TO PREVENT
                           INFECTION OF THE CLEAN.EXE PROGRAM FILE.

               Power down the infected system and boot from a clean,
          write-protected system-bootable diskette.  This insures that the
          virus is not in system memory and prevents reinfection.  After
          cleaning, power down the PC, boot from the system disk, and run
          VIRUSCAN to ensure the system has been successfully disinfected.
          After cleaning the hard disk, copy the SCAN and CLEAN programs
          on to it and check all floppy disks that have been in
          contact with the system.

               CLEAN displays the name of infected files or system areas,
          the virus found, and reports a "successful" disinfection for
          each virus removed.  If a file has multiple infections, CLEAN
          will report the virus has been removed successfully for each
          infection.

               Select valid options for CLEAN-UP from the list below:

          CLEAN {drive(s)} [virus I.D.] {options}
                           ^
                           |
                           `---- NOTE:  The square brackets "[" and "]"
                                        are required around the I.D. code.

          Options are:

          {drives}          - indicate drive(s) to be cleaned

          [virus I.D.]      - Virus identification code provided by
                              SCAN when a virus is detected (See the
                              VIRLIST.TXT file for a complete list.)

          /A                - Check all files for viruses
          /AD{x}            - Clean all drives {L = Local, N = Network}
          /GENERIC          - Clean unknown viruses
                              (see below for specifics)
          /GRF {filename}   - Clean unknown viruses using recovery
                              data file {filename}
          /MANY             - Check multiple disks for viruses
          /NOEXPIRE         - Do not display expiration notice
          /NOPAUSE          - Disable screen prompting
          /REPORT {fname}   - Create report file {fname}




CLEAN-UP Version 9.21V111                                     Page 6


          /A - This option checks all files on the drive(s) scanned and
          also examines a greater portion of files.  This substantially
          increases the amount of time required to check disks and also
          increases CLEAN's ability to detect viruses infecting overlay
          files.  It is recommended this switch only be used when an
          overlay-infecting virus is found.  

          /AD{x} - This option cleans all drives of viruses.  If /ADL
          is used, all local drives are checked, including compressed
          drives and CD-ROM's.  If /ADN is used, all networked drives
          are checked.  To clean local and network drives, use /AD by
          itself.

          /GENERIC - This option is used to clean files or system areas
          that have been infected with a new (unknown) virus.  For
          /GENERIC to work, recovery information must have been stored
          prior to infection by VIRUSCAN's /AG option.  No virus I.D. code
          is required when using the /GENERIC switch.

          /GRF {filename} - This option is used to clean files or system
          areas that  have been infected by a new (unknown) virus.  For
          /GRF to work, recovery data and validation codes must have been
          saved by VIRUSCAN's /AF option to {filename}.  No virus I.D.
          code is required when using the /GRF switch.

          /MANY - This option is used to clean multiple disks placed in
          the same drive.  If you have more than one floppy disk to check
          for viruses, the /MANY option allows you to check them without
          running CLEAN multiple times.

          /NOEXPIRE - This option disables a warning message that CLEAN
          displays after seven months warning that it may no longer be
          current with respect to known viruses.

          /NOPAUSE - This option disables the "More? (H = Help)" prompt
          displayed when CLEAN fills up a screen with 24 lines of text.
          This allows CLEAN to be run on PC's with severe infections
          without user assistance.

          /REPORT {filename} - This option saves the output of CLEAN to
          {filename} in ASCII text format.  If {filename} exists, CLEAN
          will erase it and create a new report

CLEAN-UP Version 9.21V111                                Page 9


          APPENDIX A:  CLEAN-UP'S FOREIGN LANGUAGE SUPPORT

               CLEAN-UP can display messages in a foreign language by
          reading in a replacement set of messages from an external
          file named MCAFEE.MSG.  When the MCAFEE.MSG file is placed in
          the same directory as the CLEAN.EXE file, CLEAN will display
          messages from the foreign language module instead of displaying
          messages in English (American).  Currently, French and Spanish
          message files come bundled with CLEAN-UP,  FRENCH.MSG and
          SPANISH.MSG.

               To use a foreign language module, rename it to MCAFEE.MSG
          and place it in the same directory as the CLEAN.EXE file.  When
          CLEAN-UP is run, it will check for the MCAFEE.MSG file and use it,
          if found.

          NOTE:  Using a foreign language module increases CLEAN-UP's memory
                 requirements by the size of the foreign language file (typically
                 15 to 25Kb).

               Support for other languages such as Chinese, Dutch, Finnish,
          French (Canadian), German, Hungarian, Norwegian, Portuguese,
          Russian, Spanish (European), Swahili, Swedish and Bulgarian is
          available.  Contact your local McAfee Associates Authorized Agent
          or McAfee Associates directly for availability.

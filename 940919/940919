The new beta compiles fine and seems to work fine, but during the validation
phase at the end of the compile (on a sun at Netcom) the following:

-P is obsolete. Public keys are written to "pubkeys" in the RIPEM home dir.
ripem: {Riordan's | RSAREF-based} Internet Privacy Enhanced Mail, v 2.0b2
Encrypts/decrypts mail messages using RSA and DES, and generates keys.
ripem is in the public domain, but requires agreeing to the RSAREF license

Usage:  ripem {-e | -d | -g | -c}     <in >out
  [-r recipient] [-m {encrypted | mic-only | mic-clear}] [-M message_format]
  [-u myusername]  [-h head] [-b #_of_bits_in_gen_key]

  [-v #_of_validity_months] [-K new_key_to_private_key] [-H home_dir]   
where:
  message_format (for -e only) is either: ripem1 (default) or pem.
  enc_alg is the encryption algorithm:  des-cbc (default) or des-ede-cbc.
  key_sources is a string of one or more of "fgs", which tell ripem to look
    for public keys from a File, finGer, or Server, in the order specified.
  head is one or more of "ipr", for Include headers in msg; Prepend headers
    to output; get Recipients from headers.  
  random_sources is one or more of "cefkms", specifying "random" input from
    Command line, Entire command, File, Keyboard, Message, or running
System.
  recip_opts is one or more of "amn", for Abort if can't find keys for
    all users; include Me as a recipient if encrypting; None of the above.
Relevant environment variables:   RIPEM_HOME_DIR,
  RIPEM_PUBLIC_KEY_FILE, RIPEM_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE, RIPEM_KEY_TO_PRIVATE_KEY,
  RIPEM_USER_NAME, RIPEM_RANDOM_FILE, RIPEM_SERVER_NAME, RIPEM_ARGS

Yes, thanks for pointing this out.  I need to change
the makefile "benchmark" target.
I am currently struggling with a problem in which RIPEM
overwrites DOS and hangs the machine when built by MSVC 1.0.
MSVC 1.0 itself sometimes hangs during compilation, though,
so there could be some non-RIPEM problem.
When this situation is resolved, I will make a more general
beta release of Jeff's code.
(All the work on 2.0 is by Jeff T.)

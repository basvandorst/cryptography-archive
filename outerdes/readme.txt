This is a simple DES main program, designed to be similar to
and compatible with (but faster than!) Sun's "des".
The DES algorithm is by Richard Outerbridge; the main 
program is by Mark Riordan.

The program has been tested under Solaris 2.3, SunOS 4.1.1, AIX 3.2.3,
MSDOS 6.2, and Windows NT 3.1.  An MS-DOS executble is included.

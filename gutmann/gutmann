It's known that it's not overly secure, although possibly not well-known 
(I've been discouraging people from using it whenever I'm asked about it).  I 
found at least three possible attacks in about 1993, but unfortunately have 
lost the notes I had on them.  My conclusion was that to make it secure it 
needed (among other things) so many rounds that it's main advantage - speed - 
would be entirely negated, making it pretty well useless.

Please enlighten me, since in my copy of the DigiSign Utility, there is
no PREF resource, what is it's resource ID and what is the patch to
generate say a 768 bit key.

Oops. It's the PRFS resource. Apple has so far refused to say, and I've been
getting the run around between Apple Developer Services and RSADSI. Try
experimenting with it. There's only one non-zero hex value in there. Try
making it bigger, or moving the non-zero bits to the left.

I made one test, and got what looks like a 1024 bit key. Let me know how you
make out.

If any other reader knows the facts, a post would be welcome.

David

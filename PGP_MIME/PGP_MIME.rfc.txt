            Abstract

            MIME [RFC-1341,  RFC-1521]  defines  a  format  and  general
            framework  for  the representation of a wide variety of data
            types  in  Internet  mail.   This   document   defines   one
            particular  type of MIME data, the application/pgp type, for
            "pretty good" privacy,  authentication,  and  encryption  in
            Internet mail.  The application/pgp MIME type is intended to
            facilitate the wider interoperation of private mail across a
            wide variety of hardware and software platforms.

            The application/pgp MIME type

            This document defines an extremely  simple  subtype  of  the
            MIME   content-type   "application",  the  "application/pgp"
            subtype.  This subtype was designed to  meet  the  following

                 criteria:

                 1.  Maximal backward-compatibility  with  pre-MIME
                 implementations of PGP for ASCII text mail.

                 2.  Ability to use PGP to enhance the  privacy  of
                 MIME mail with non-ASCII or non-text data.

                 3.  Ability to optionally differentiate "key-only"
                 messages from more complex PGP data, for different
                 treatment by user agent software

                 4.  Ease of implementation.

            This   document   defines   a   new    MIME    content-type,
            "application/pgp".   The content-type line for this type may
            have one optional parameters, "format", as described below.

            The MIME content-type "application/pgp"  is  a  very  simple
            adaptation of PGP.  When a MIME entity has a content-type of
            "application/pgp", the data within it is assumed  to  be  in
            PGP format.  [PGP]

            PGP's data format is ASCII  text  that  includes  blocks  of
            privacy-enhanced  text.   Such  text  might be authenticated
            (signed), or encrypted.  The  PGP  data  is  self-describing
            with  regard  to format and content.  In current versions of
            PGP, only textual data can be encrypted.  Beginning  with  a
            future  version  of  PGP, it is expected that arbitrary MIME
            data can also be encrypted, but the fact that the data is in
            MIME format is not evident from the outside of the PGP data.
            Thus even the content-type of data being transmitted may  be
            made private by PGP.

            Of course, once any decryption or verification is performed,
            the  resulting data must be displayed to the user.  A future
            version of PGP will include a command line option that  will
            guarantee that ALL output will be in MIME format, regardless
            of whether it was initially encrypted as MIME or text.  With
            this  option,  the  decrypted  result of any application/pgp
            MIME entity may be used  as  input  to  any  general-purpose
            MIME-viewing tool.

            The "Format" Parameter





            Borenstein                                          [Page 2]

            The optional parameter  "format"  may  be  included  on  the
            Content-line  for PGP data, to declare the type of encrypted
            data enclosed, as follows:

                 Content-type: application/pgp; format=mime

            or

                 Content-type: application/pgp; format=keys-only

            or

                 Content-type: application/pgp; format=text

            This memo defines only three possible values for the  format
            parameter, namely "text", "mime", and "keys-only".

            It  should  be  stressed  that  the  format   parameter   is
            completely  optional.  Further, it is expected that a future
            release  of  PGP  will  make   this   parameter   completely
            unnecessary  for  any  desired  functionality,  by  building
            knowledge  about  encapsulated  MIME  into  the   PGP   data
            structures.  However, the parameter may remain a convenience
            for some implementors, and in the interim the  "format=mime"
            parameter  makes  it  possible  for  existing  MIME  and PGP
            implementations to be configured  to  interoperate  smoothly
            for  the  automatic encryption and decryption of non-textual
            data.   In  the  absence  of  the  "format"  parameter,  the
            decrypted  data  from  non-MIME-aware versions of PGP should
            generally be treated as ASCII text by mail readers.

            Format=text

            If present, the parameter "format=text" indicates  that  the
            result  of  decrypting the application/pgp entity is textual
            data, including data encrypted by pre-MIME versions of  PGP.
            No  further  MIME-related  processing  is  called  for after
            decryption.

            Text is the default value of the format parameter.  That is,
            the  following  two  Content-type  specifications  should be
            treated as equivalent by user agents:

                 Content-type: application/pgp





            Borenstein                                          [Page 3]





            Expires 11/20/draft-borenstein-pgp-mime-00.txt      May 1994


                 Content-type: application/pgp; format=text

            However, it should be noted that the  latter  form  is  more
            explicit,  and  should  be  generated whenever an encrypting
            agent has definite knowledge that the data  being  encrypted
            are simply non-MIME text.

            Format=mime

            If present, the parameter "format=mime" indicates  that  the
            result  of  decrypting  the application/pgp entity should be
            treated as another MIME  entity.   That  is,  it  should  be
            inspected  for Content-type, etc.  and parsed recursively as
            a MIME entity.

            Format=keys-only

            If present, the parameter "format=keys-only" indicates  that
            the  application/pgp  entity  contains no encrypted or other
            data, only PGP keys.  A user agent that so chooses may treat
            such  entities  specially, e.g. by providing the user with a
            special key-management interface.  A user agent without such
            specialized   understanding   may   ignore  the  "keys-only"
            parameter, and  (for  example)  pass  all  "application/pgp"
            entities directly to the pgp program.

            A Note on Transfer Encodings

            One area where MIME and PGP have redundant mechanisms is  in
            the  transformation  of  binary  data into a mail-safe form.
            For this purpose, PGP uses "ASCII armor" and MIME  uses  the
            base64  content-transfer-encoding.   As  it  happens,  these
            mechanisms are  virtually  identical,  but  are  flagged  in
            different  manners.   The PGP mechanism is self-identifying,
            while the MIME mechanism uses a  "Content-Transfer-Encoding"
            header field.

            The application/pgp content-type has been carefully designed
            to  let  either of these mechanisms be used.  If PGP is used
            in a manner  that  produces  "ASCII  armor",  then  no  MIME
            content-transfer-encoding is needed (or "7bit" may be used).
            If PGP is used in a manner that produces binary data, then a
            MIME  content-transfer-encoding of "base64" may be used, and
            a MIME agent will restore the data to its binary form before
            processing it as PGP data.




            Borenstein                                          [Page 4]





            Expires 11/20/draft-borenstein-pgp-mime-00.txt      May 1994


            This duality of mechanisms implies, however, that  the  PGP-
            processing  routines must be prepared to receive PGP data in
            either binary OR ASCII armor forms.

            Security Considerations

            Security issues are not discussed in this memo,  which  only
            describes how PGP usage is labelled in MIME.  PGP itself, of
            course, is a technology focused on issues  of  security  and
            privacy,  and  the PGP documentation is replete with helpful
            information and advice about the security issues  PGP  seeks
            to address.

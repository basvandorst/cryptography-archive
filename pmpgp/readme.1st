Hi,

This is the distribution archive of pmPGP Version 1.3.

pmPGP is an OS/2 PM shell for PGP. pmPGP is Shareware.

pmPGP contains no cryptographic functionality, 
it uses PGP to do the real work. You need an OS/2 port of PGP
to be able to use pmPGP.

This archive does not contain PGP.

This zip file contains an other zip file inner.zip which
contains the program.

 ------------- inner.zip -----------------

A signature of the file inner.zip is in inner.asc. You need
to own my public key to check this signature. You can find my
public key in thomas.asc in the inner.zip or on public
key servers eg. pgp-public-keys@kub.nl.

Check the my signature as follows:
	pgp inner.asc inner.zip

Expected output :
	Good signature from user "Thomas Blummer <100273.3607@compuserve.com>".
	
USE PMPGP ONLY IF YOU VERYFIED USING THE SIGNATURE ITS ORIGINALITY.
 ------------------------------------------

Unzip inner.zip and start setup.exe to install pmPGP on your workstation.

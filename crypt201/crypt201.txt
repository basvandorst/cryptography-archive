CRYPT consists of four files:
	1. CRYPT201.EXE
	2. CRYPTDOC.ZIP
	3. CRYPTSRC.ZIP
	4. CRYPT201.TXT which is this file.

CRYPT provides a solving environment for the following puzzle ciphers:
	1. Simple substitution with word divisions
	2. Rail fence
	3. Several transpositions
	4. 5x5 and 6x6 Bifids.
It includes numerous sample ciphers of these types for you to practice on.
It runs on MS-DOS, and requires a hard disk and the math co-processor.

The NSA has ruled that the simple substitution solver is export restricted.
It has not ruled on the other ciphers because I never asked for a commodity
jurisdiction determination for them. Their exportability is not determined.

This program is free, except that I keep copyright. You are free to distribute
so long as I retain credit as author. If you mean commercial use, please get in
touch with me first. Basically, you have free use and non-commercial
redistribution while I keep ownership.

			INSTALLING THE PROGRAM

CRYPT201.EXE is a self-extracting zip file.  To install CRYPT, version 2,
execute CRYPT201.EXE with the subdirectory switch -d.  This will install the
main program in subdirectory \CRYPT (from your current directory), and a
collection of sample cryptograms in subdirectory \GRAMS (from your current
directory).

The simplest scheme is to execute CRYPT201.EXE from your root directory on your
C drive.  For example:

C:>crypt201 -d

This will install the program in directory \CRYPT, creating the directory if
necessary; and the cryptograms in directory \GRAMS.



		       THE HANDBOOK

There are three versions of the handbook:
	CRYPT2.DOC	for dot matrix printers. Contains embedded printer
			controls. CRYPT2.DOC is zipped into CRYPT201.EXE.
			Does not print on lasers. Provided you have a dot
			matrix, print it with the following:
				C:>copy crypt2.doc lpt1

	CRYPT2.ASC	ASCII version. Prints on anything but not as pretty.
			CRYPT2DOC.ASC is also zipped into CRYPT201.EXE.

	CRYPTDOC.ZIP	Microsoft Word for Window 6.0 version. Very pretty
			output if you have Word 6.0. Separate zip file.

				PACKAGE

Directory CRYPT contains:

	CRYPT.EXE	CRYPT version 2.  Solving environment for some classic
			puzzle ciphers commonly used by the American Cryptogram
			Association.  These are:
			1.  Aristocrat (simple substitutions with word
			    divisions).
			2.  Rail fence
			3.  Route transpositions
			4.  Complete columnar transposition
			5.  Nihilist transposition
			6.  Bifids -- 5x5, 6x6, and Twins.

	ENGLISH.DCT	Pattern dictionary of English in ASCII
	ENGLISH.NDX	Binary index to ENGLISH.DCT
	ENGLISH.DAT	English statistical data
	BLDINDEX.EXE	Program to rebuild ENGLISH.NDX if the dictionary is
			changed.
	CRYPT001.HLP - CRYPT006.HLP  On line help screens.

	CRYPT2.DOC	CRYPT Handbook.  Formatted for dot matrix printer.
	CRYPT2.ASC	CRYPT Handbook in plain ASCII for laser printers.

Directory GRAMS contains:

	Numerous cryptograms in CRYPT's internal format.
		Aristocrats = yyiann   yy = year; i = The Cryptogram issue;
				       A = Aristocrat; NN = number.
		Bifids = .bif extension
		Nihilist transpositions = .nt extension
		Routes = .rt extension
		Complete columnars = cct
		Rail fences = rf

Finally, the source is contained in CRYPTSRC.ZIP. Put this zip file in a
directory convenient for you and unzip it. The program is entirely in MASM (2.0
if I remember right). NEW is the link editor response file. WHEREIS is a cross
reference of routine name to module name.

ZZZ is the stack, and it must be linked last (CRYPT requires the stack to be
the last segment in memory). You may have to play with your MASM options and
link editor options to force the correct order. You should find several useful
MASM routines, among them a radix sort, a quicksort with pivoting, a
chi-squared probability computation, and IEEE floating point to ASCII
conversion. If these routines are useful to you, you are free to use them as
you see fit. Just give me the credit for them.

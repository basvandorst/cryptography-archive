This package provides a couple of tiny programs that monitor incoming
requests for IP services such as TFTP, EXEC, FTP, RSH, TELNET, RLOGIN,
FINGER, SYSTAT, and many others.

Optional features are: access control based on pattern matching; remote
username lookup using the RFC 931 protocol; protection against rsh and
rlogin attacks from hosts that pretend to have someone elses name.

The programs can be installed without requiring any changes to existing
software or configuration files. By default, they just log the remote
host name and then invoke the real network daemon. No information is
exchanged with the remote client process.

Enhancements over the previous release are: 

    1 - network daemons no longer have to live within a common directory
    2 - the access control code now uses both the host address and name
    3 - an access control pattern that supports netmasks
    4 - additional protection against forged host names
    5 - a pattern that matches hosts whose name or address lookup fails
    6 - an operator that prevents hosts or services from being matched
    7 - optional remote username lookup with the RFC 931 protocol
    8 - an optional umask to prevent the creation of world-writable files
    9 - hooks for access control language extensions
   10 - last but not least, thoroughly revised documentation.

Except for the change described under (2) the present version should be
backwards compatible with earlier ones.

- -----------------------------------
notes by Jens von Pilgrim, June 1997

This distribution of PGP contains two parts:

1) The original version of pgp 2.6.3i compiled by
   Stale Schumacher for Windows 95/NT
   This part contains following files:
   - pgp263ii.zip
   - pgp263ii.asc (Stale Schumacher's signature of pgp263ii.zip) 
   - Setup.doc   
   - Readme.usa
   - Readme.1st

2) The additional dll-version of pgp 2.6.3i compiled by
   Jens von Pilgrim for Windows 95/NT
   This part vontains following files:
   - pgp263idll.zip
   - pgp263idll.asc (Jens von Pilgrim's signature of pgp263idll.zip)
   - ReadmeDll.1st (this file)


Important:
Please read the files "Readme.usa" and "Readme.1st".

The dll-version of pgp 2.6.3i is only an addon-product.
All restrictions, copyright notes, hints, advices and so on of
the original version of pgp 2.6.3i are also valid for the pgp-dll-version!


Setup:
1) Read the files "Readme.usa", "Readme.1st" and "Setup.doc"
2) Install the original version of pgp as described in "Setup.doc"
3) Extract the files from pgp263idll.zip into the pgp-directory
4) Make sure that the pgp-directory is in the path

pgp263idll.zip contain two files:
- - pgp263i.dll
- - jpgp.exe

The dll is the orgiginal pgp-version, modified to fit as a dll. The source-code of
the dll is available too ( http://www.gwdg.de/~jpilgri/jvppgp )

jpgp.exe is a simple "graphical" interface for pgp. You can use it instead of pgp.exe.
The source of jpgp.exe is available as an example for the dll. You can also download it
from http://www.gwdg.de/~jpilgri/jvppgp.
In the upper edit-line you can enter the normal pgp-commands and options. If you drag a
file on the jpgp-symbol, jpgp is started with the filename in the edit-line.
The large window in the middle displays the pgp-output. Under this window you find a small
window in the middle wich contains the return-code of pgp.

A more comfortable tool is also available from http://www.gwdg.de/~jpilgri/jvppgp.
It's called jvppgp frontend. This frontend is also useable as an extension for the freeware
mail-programm PEGASUS Mail 32. Just look on this pages.

I hope all things work fine. As usual, no programm is 100% error-free.
The author isn't responsible for any losses which occurs because 
you're using this software!

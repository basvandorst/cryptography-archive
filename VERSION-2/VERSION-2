		Elliptic Curve Crypto Source
			Version 2.0

At location ft.csua.berkeley.edu/pub/cypherpunks/ciphers are 2 files
elliptic.2.tar and elliptic.2.doc.  These contain the same functionality
as the version one, but run twice as fast.  The speed up comes mostly from
eliminating one subroutine within the optimal normal basis multiply.
For details see the doc file.

In addition, a symmetric key routine has been added.  This is interesting
because the output passes all known tests for randomness (so far, more
testing is in progress).  It is not of much interest because it is slow
and has a large message expansion (half a meg of ascii went to 2.2 Meg
of ascii numbers, took 6 hours to compute on 40 MHz processor). 

So, enjoy playing with either the public or secret key routines to learn
the math.  Special thanks to professor Schroeppel for helping me out
with this, many of the ideas for the speed up came from discussions with
him.  Please see the doc file for more info.

Patience, persistence, truth,
Dr. mike

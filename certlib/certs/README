		Unsupported Release of the Certificate Library
		----------------------------------------------

Welcome to this unsupported release of the Certificate Library. This
library contains:

	o Encoding for Version 1 X.509 certificates (X509Cert, X509Skip)
	o Encoding of Hashed Public Key Certificates (HashCert)
	o Useful primitive Classes such as Bstream.
	o Generic Interface Class (SkipCert)
	o ASN BER encoder/decoder
	o MD2 and MD5 Hash Functions
	o SHA-1 Hash Function

Note: This library can only encode or decode Certificates.  It is unable
to sign or verify signatures on certificates.  It is COMPLETELY 
unsupported.  There is a nontrivial library.  If you are not a developer,
who is interested in digging into C++ class libraries, this library may not
be for you.  Some hints:

	o certs/lib/test.C is a simple test of encoding certificates
	o Class X509Cert is a generic X509 Certificate Class
	o Class X509Skip is an interface class to providing Skip Functions
	o Class HashCert is the Unsigned DH public value prividing an
	  interface identical to X509Skip.
	o Class SkipCert is a base type which defines the interface that
	  both HashCert and X509Skip confirm to. SkipCert is the preferred 
	  way for an application to deal with both HashCert and X509Cert.
	o certs/utils/print_cert is a good example of How all this stuff
	  fits together, as well.

Please send comments/bug fixes to freeskip@incog.com.

This is the certificate library.  It contains implementations of various
Certificate Classes and derived common classes.  

	A Generic Skip Certificate Class.  This is the Class the key manager
		    uses as an interface to the other certificate classes:
		SkipCert.C
		SkipCert.h
	

	A Skip Hash Certificate Class -  Implementation of Hashed Public
		    keys as defined in the SKIP draft:
		HashCert.C
		HashCert.h

	A Skip X509 Certificate Class - Derived class from X509 with the
		    SKIP specific interface:
		X509skip.C
		X509skip.h

	X509 Certificate Class and associates:
		X509Cert.C
		X509Cert.h
		Name.C
		Name.h
		ObjId.C
		ObjId.h
		Sig.C
		Sig.h
		Signed.C
		Signed.h
		CRL.C 		- Note this has not been ported to LIBG++
		CRL.h
		trusted_certs.h
		utils.C
		utils.h
		userfuncs.C
		userfuncs.h
		ca.h
		cafuncs.C

	DSA signature stubs:
		dsa.h
		dsasubr.C

	A Time class for use with X509 Certificates (and used throughout SKIP)
		Time.C
		Time.h

	An ASN1 encoder and decoder:
		asn1_der.h
		asn1_der_decode.C
		asn1_der_encode.C

	Public domain implementations of MD5 and MD2:
		md2.c
		md2.h
		md5.c
		md5.h

	Generally useful Classes used throughout the SKIP userspace code:
		Bigint.C  - Implementation of Big Integers (no Math)
		Bigint.h
		Bstream.C - Byte stream class.  Incredibly useful way of
			    dealing with arbitrary data.
		Bstream.h
		my_types.h -Headers for internal types.

	Glue routines for the BN package:
		cert_bn_glue.C
		bn_glue.h

	Random Number generator:
		randseed.C

  <H1><a name=intro>Introduction</a></H1>

  Cryptix is a suite of cryptographic classes for Java.
  This distribution is Cryptix
  Compiled Classes 3.0.3
  made on Tue Jan 13 16:42:24 CET 1998.



<P>
Included in the Compiled Classes distribution is:
<UL>
  <LI> the IJCE and providers packaged in JARs
  <LI> test programs within the JARs
  <LI> useful scripts to get it going
  <LI> this release readme, the main readme and the FAQ etc.
  <LI> doco in guide
</UL>

<H1><a name="install">Installation</a></H1>
To get the Cryptix Compiled Classes distributions installed and tested,
follow the main <a href="README.html#install">README instructions</a>.

<P>
For this Compiled Classes also do the following:

<OL>
  <LI> Do not unJAR the archives (*.jar) within the classes directory.
</OL>


<H1><a name="test">Testing</a></H1>
Once installed, Cryptix should be tested.
See the
<a href="guide/distribution/Testing.html">Binary Distribution Testing Guide</a>
for general ways to test.

<P>
This distribution was tested at make time, and
the actions were recorded into platform scripts
in the <code>auto</code> directory (see auto/testjar*).

<P>
No JARs failed their tests.

<P>
In order to repeat the distribution tests, do for Unix:
<pre>
    ../auto/testjar.sh
</pre>
or for NT/95, do:
<pre>
    ; Note, this batch is untested - and written by a non-DOS person :-)
    ..\auto\testjar
</pre>

<P>
If any of the above listed working tests fail, please send a bug report.
Note that the automatic release script produces a list of working
tests;  non-working tests are commented out.
The latter <i>should</i> not be present,
as non-working code is dropped from formal releases.




<H1><a name=new>New in Release 3.0.3 </a></H1>
<P>
MD5, SHA-1, SHA-0 have a known bug using the update() method.
With SHA-1 and SHA-0,
this case is commented out in the Test*.java programs.
It is used to add digest data in bulk, the relevant test
is the million a's of the conformance set.

<P>
This release - 3.0.3 - is mostly a bug fix release.
These features are now included:
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>
     Tools: example programs demonstrating Cryptix:
      <UL>
        <LI>Scar is an archiver that uses message digests and ciphers.
        <LI>UnixCrypt is an emulation of the infamous Unix crypt(3) function.
      </UL>
      Tools are found in <code>cryptix/tools</code>.

  </LI> <P> <LI>
     HMACs for all message digests have been added,
     according to RFC-2104 and RFC-2202.

  </LI> <P> <LI>
     Cryptix 2.2 compatibility now includes:
     <UL>
       <LI>message digests,
       <LI>modes,
       <LI>ancillary classes
     </UL>
     along with the ciphers.

  </LI> <P> <LI>
     documentation:
     <UL>
       <LI><a href=guide/cryptix/Support.html>Supported Algorithms</a>
           shows all algorithms supported with useful details in colours.
     </UL>

  </LI> <P> <LI>
     Bugs fixed in these areas:
     <UL>
       <LI>RSA gave an occasional
           ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException which is now fixed.
	   ElGamal has the same bug, but that's not fixed yet.
       <LI>Triple DES data has now been checked against at
	   least one other implementation.
     </UL>
</UL>
<P>
These features were included in the previous release:
<P>
<UL>
  <LI> PK: ElGamal over GF(p) is now included.
  <LI> Symmetric key algorithms: DES-EDE3 - Triple DES with 3 keys.
  <LI> message digests SHA1, SHA0, MD5.
     These new MDs are using old code and are missing Cloneable,
     and the update method doesn't currently work.
  <LI> Cryptix 2.2 cipher compatibility.
  <LI> Documentation:  The FAQ and Guides.
</UL>
<P>



<H1><a name=not>What's *not* here</a></H1>

Still on our ever-growing TODO list:
   
<UL> 
  <LI> compatibility with Java 1.2

  </LI> <P> <LI> IJCE:
      <UL>
        <LI>test devoted to IJCE that can run independant of Cryptix
            (java.security.IJCE_test or some Sun standard name?)
      </UL>

  </LI> <P> <LI> testing:
      <UL>
        <LI>Some of the Test* programs do not correctly exit,
          so failures are not detected.
        <LI>
          <code>util/testjar.sh</code> produces guess-code W95/NT batch
          scripts in <code>auto/testjar.bat</code>.
      </UL>


  </LI> <P> <LI> Cryptix 2.2 compatibility:
      <UL>
        <LI>RSA
      </UL>
      is still to be done.

  </LI> <P> <LI> Native libraries are not currently included.

  </LI> <P> <LI> PGP is not here at all

  </LI> <P> <LI>
    Cryptix has only been compiled and run with
    Sun-sourced compilers and JVMs.  Specifically,
    there is a compilation error with Guavac.  Other
    non-Sun tools have not been tried yet.

  </LI> <P> <LI>
    Javadoc is distributed without images.

</UL>

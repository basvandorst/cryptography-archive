<h2><a name="desc" href="#index_desc">Description and Information</a></h2>

<h3><a name="d_intro" href="#index_desc">Introduction</a></h3>

<p>
The Cryptix libraries contain a suite of cryptographic classes.
There is an implementation for each of Java and Perl.

<p>
Some of the classes have optional native code for performance reasons. This
code has been tested on Windows 95 and Windows NT (Intel x86). Previous versions
have been tested on Solaris (SPARC), Linux (Intel x86) and
IRIX (MIPS). Both source and binaries are available for various platforms
(also see the section, "<a href="#i_native">Use of Native Code</a>.")


<h3><a name="d_loc" href="#index_desc">Where to get Cryptix</a></h3>

<p>
To download source or binaries, start at the Cryptix
<a href="http://www.systemics.com/software/cryptix-java/">Mirror Index</a>.
We are actively looking for more mirror sites.


<h3><a name="d_mail" href="#index_desc">Mailing List</a></h3>

<p>
Mailing lists exist for the users of Cryptix.  Here are the terms:

<ul>
  <li>
    The lists can be joined by sending one or both of
<pre>
    subscribe cryptix-java
    subscribe cryptix-perl
</pre>
    to
    <a href="mailto:majordomo@systemics.com">majordomo@systemics.com</a>.
  <p>
  <li>
    Please keep posts limited to Cryptix issues.
    These mail groups are
    maintained to keep coders up to date with Cryptix issues only.
    If a wider subject matter is desired,
    we have no objection in principle to
    setting up another mail group.
  <p>
  <li>
    No spam or commercial email permitted on any mail groups managed
    by Systemics Ltd.  None.
  <p>
  <li>
    To avoid spam, all posts must come from a subscriber.  The <i>munge</i>
    feature is on so you should subscribe with your top-level domain
    name such as <i>my_name@cypher.com</i> even if your mail appears to
    come from an internal machine such as <i>machine.cypher.com</i>
    <p>
    Do this by sending
<pre>
    subscribe cryptix-java <I>my_name@cypher.com</I>
</pre>
    as above.  The list maintainer will need to authorise this.
  </li>
  <p>
  <li>
    The preferred place for bug reports is on the list.
    If you are not subscribed, you should.  Bugs can also
    be sent to <a href="mailto:bugs@systemics.com">bugs@systemics.com</a>
    but no reply is likely, this is a one-way transfer to a suitable
    developer.
</ul>


<h3><a name="d_doc" href="#index_desc">Documentation</a></h3>

<p>
With release 2.2 of Cryptix-Java and beyond, we have made a big effort to
improve the documentation.  There is is still a long way to go, but it's better
than the official "sparse" rating that we earned on Adam Shostock's
<a href="http://www.homeport.org/~adam/crypto/">freeware crypto page</a>.
Pre-built and on-line browsable documentation is listed from the
<a href="http://www.systemics.com/software/cryptix-java">Mirrors</a>.
Cryptix-Perl remains sparse.

<h4>Instructions for 3.x</h4>

<p>
<blockquote>
   If you prefer to build the documentation using javadoc, first unzip
   the <samp>src.zip</samp> file that came with the JDK (if you haven't already
   done so), and set the JDK_SOURCE environment variable to that directory.
   Make sure the Cryptix source release is in the <strong>current</strong>
   directory, then run a script depending on your operating system:

   <ul>
     <li>
       Under Unix, enter
<pre>
    JDK_SOURCE=/path/to/jdk/src
    sh util/makedocs.sh
</pre>
    
       Replace the first line above with "setenv JDK_SOURCE /path/to/jdk/src"
       for csh-like shells.
     </li>
     <p>
     <li>
       Under NT or Windows 95 (from a command prompt), enter
<pre>
    set JDK_SOURCE=C:\path\to\jdk\src
    util\makedocs
</pre>
     </li>
   </ul>

   <p>
   You will need a reasonable amount of free memory to do this (about 12 MB).
</blockquote>


<h4>Instructions for 2.2</h4>

<p>
<blockquote>
   All the documentation is in <code>javadoc</code> format.
   To build the documentation, under Unix, try this group of
   commands within the directory you extracted the source:
<pre>
    mkdir doc
    CLASSPATH=. javadoc -author -d doc $(find cryptix/* -type d -print | sed -e 's,/,.,g')
</pre>
   That is, find all the directories,
   convert the names to package dot format, and pass
   the list to <code>javadoc</code>, which will produce
   <code>doc/packages.html</code> which is a browsable file.
</blockquote>


<h3><a name="d_source" href="#index_desc">How to Compile the Source Release</a></h3>

<p>
This section is specific to Cryptix-Java 2.2.0a, 3.x and later.

<p>
To compile the Java source, make sure the source release is in the
current directory, then run a script depending on your operating system:

<ul>
  <li>
    Under Unix, enter
<pre>
    sh util/finalbuild.sh
</pre>
  </li>
  <p>
  <li>
    Under NT or Windows 95 (from a command prompt), enter
<pre>
    util\finalbuild
</pre>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Also see the
<a href="guide/distribution/Compilation.html">compilation guide</a>.

<p>
To compile the native library source, see the file
<a href="native/README.txt">native/README.txt</a>.


<h3><a name="d_business" href="#index_desc">Business Model</a></h3>

<p>
Cryptix is provided for free, with no royalties.
It is never likely to be anything else, and we
(the <a href="#c_owners">owners</a>)
promise never to chase you
for fees or royalties or whatever for any copy of Cryptix
that has been released on this basis.  All code was either provided
on this basis, or written explicitly by the Cryptix Development
Team.

<p>
Cryptix was originally written by Systemics, Ltd.
The original developers believed that selling crypto code was not
(and is not) a workable business.  However,
good strong crypto libraries were still required and
were not then available.

<p>
The solution was to publish Cryptix as a freeware library
and encourage others to contribute, use and test the code.
Then Cryptix has been transferred
over to the Internet community, in the guise of the Cryptix
Development Team.  This process is substantially
complete, as releases from Cryptix-Java 2.2 and onwards have been
substantially produced by
people who have no direct relationship with Systemics,
whose role is relegated to one of distribution and support to 
the development team.

<p>
In the meantime, Systemics specialises in financial cryptography
applications.


<h3><a name="d_support" href="#index_desc">Support</a></h3>

<p>
There is no formal support for freeware users of Cryptix.

<p>
It is a freely released product, and the Cryptix Development
Team has no budget for providing help or for fixing problems.
We will try our best, but money-making projects come first.
Often it will take us several days to get a chance to look
at a question, so please be patient.  Sometimes we
don't ever solve problems.

<p>
Problems, bug reports and other requests should be posted to the
<a href="#d_mail">mailgroups</a>.
We would encourage everyone to end their posts with "Has anyone
else seen this?" or somesuch, and hope that someone has <tt>:))</tt>

<p>
The USENET newsgroup
<a href="news:comp.lang.java.security">comp.lang.java.security</a> is
also a useful resource for questions about security in Java.

<p>
If anyone would like to discuss a more formal support arrangement,
please mail us.  If private mail is necessary, send to any mail
address on the
<a href="http://www.systemics.com/mailto.html">Systemics</a> home page, and
it will be redirected to the most appropriate place.  Please mark
such correspondence as private, as Systemics commonly forwards
bug reports directly to the mailgroups, or developers, or both.

<h2><a name="regs" href="#index_regs">Questions on "Regulations" and Patents</a></h2>

<h3><a name="r_ear" href="#index_regs">Is Cryptix subject to EAR or ITAR export regulations?</a></h3>

<p>
No, Cryptix is available from servers located around the world.


<h3><a name="r_export" href="#index_regs">Can Cryptix be exported from the US?</a></h3>

<p>
The U.S. Government says that you should ask for approval,
and that is unlikely to be granted, in our opinion.
The U.S. crypto debate is well documented elsewhere.

<h3><a name="r_exdes" href="#index_regs">Can I export my application using DES taken from Cryptix?</a></h3>

Not being Americans, we are not familiar with the detail of
what can and can't be done, and every time we comment we get it wrong.

<P>
It's an issue that you must address yourself using your own resources.
You can try asking on the mailgroup, but please address your questions
to other Americans who might have something to say.

<P>
If you do come up with a strategy that involves coding,
feel free to talk to us about it.  We can't comment on the
workability of any particular solution - again, not being
Americans, nor lawyers - but we can code up your requirements
after some negotitation.

<h3><a name="r_rsaref" href="#index_regs">Do you use the RSAref code?</a></h3>

<p>
No, Cryptix has its own implementation of the RSA algorithm.

<h3><a name="r_rsapatent" href="#index_regs">What about the RSA patent?</a></h3>

<p>
The RSA patent is only an issue for U.S. users, and maybe Canadians.
Cryptix was originally written for non-North American usage, so that it is not
an issue for most Cryptix users.  We know of no attempt by U.S. users
to license the RSA patent on this basis.

Note that there are alternatives to RSA.

<h3><a name="r_idea" href="#index_regs">What about the IDEA patent?</a></h3>

<p>
A licence from
<a href="http://www.ascom.ch/Web/systec/policy/index.html">ASCOM</a>
may be required for commercial use of the IDEA algorithm.
If your application does not use IDEA, then this should not apply.
Alternative algorithms are provided.

<h3><a name="r_legal" href="#index_regs">Is it legal for me to use your library?</a></h3>

<p>
The patent and legal aspects of this library will vary
from country to country.
Bert-Jaap Koops'
<a href="http://cwis.kub.nl/~frw/people/koops/lawsurvy.htm">
Crypto Law Survey</a>
is an excellent summary, but for the final word you should seek professional
advice locally.

<h2><a name="implementation" href="#index_implementation">Implementation Choices</a></h2>


<h3><a name="i_history" href="#index_implementation">History</a></h3>

A brief history of Cryptix-Java, in reverse chronological order, follows.

<h4><a name="i_history_3" href="#index_implementation">V3</a></h4>

In December of 1997, the Cryptix Development Team released V3
to the public.
This release represents a new transition by including the IJCE as
the core architecture for cryptography in Java.

<P>
Version 3 also supports a more flexible trade-off between the performance of
native code and the portability of Java: native versions of some algorithms
are available for speed, but a Java version will be used if these are not
present, or fail to load correctly. (Sun's "100% Pure Java" initiative
specifically allows this approach for provider-based interfaces such as the
Security API, although Cryptix has not yet been put forward for "100% Pure Java"
certification.)

<P>
Some overhead is incurred by the IJCE being pure Java, but there is scope for
significantly reducing this overhead in future versions, for cases where large
amounts of data are encrypted. A great deal of attention has been paid to
ensuring that the Cryptix native code does not introduce security problems
through buffer overflows, incorrect memory management, race conditions
etc.

<P>
Currently, V3 is still in the early phases, but work is progressing
to round it off. The next major change is likely to be support for JCE 1.2, the
next version of Sun's Java Cryptography Extension.


<h4><a name="i_history_2" href="#index_implementation">V2</a></h4>

Version 2 of Cryptix-Java was characterised by the switch from
native code to all-Java:

<UL>
  <LI> 2.4.x was an external series for development of V3 distribution.
       Many beta testers have these test releases,
       but they should upgrade to V3.  Many thanks for your help.
  <LI> 2.3.x was an internal series for development of V3 distribution.
  <LI> 2.2.2 was the planned release version for the IJCE,
       but this was recast as <a href="#i_history_3">V3</a>
  <LI> 2.2.0a was an interim release that included the first alpha version
       of the developing IJCE.
  <LI> 2.2.1 was an interim release reworked for Java 1.1.
  <LI> 2.2 was released in May? of 1997.  This included more algorithms,
       and a beefed-up PGP section.
  <LI> 2.0 was released in February of 1997, as the first all-Java
       library.   This was developed in response to the installation
       difficulties imposed by the native requirements of V1.
</UL>

<h4><a name="i_history_1" href="#index_implementation">V1</a></h4>

The original Systemics release used native code for speed.
It's still faster than the all-Java Cryptix,
but this was the beginning of a lesson that
Sun encoded in their <i>write once, run anywhere</i> mantra.

<p>
<h3><a name="i_serial" href="#index_implementation">Java Serializable Interface</a></h3>

<p>
<i>Why don't the Cryptix-Java classes implement the Serializable interface?</i>

<p>
There are a number of reasons.
Here's <a href="mailto:david.hopwood@lmh.ox.ac.uk">David</a>'s list:

<ul>
  <li>
    For classes that use native code, it is often difficult to get at the
    native state in order to copy it (this is why Cipher objects are not
    Serializable or Cloneable, for example). Also, I'm totally paranoid
    about security bugs in native code, so any optional feature that makes
    ensuring security more complicated, as serialization does, is unlikely
    to be supported for those classes.
  </li>
  
  <p>
  <li>
    Anyone who can cause a chosen byte stream to be deserialized can run
    code on the VM that is doing the deserialization (not necessarily arbitrary
    code, but enough to cause concern). So, use of deserialization is a
    potential security bug unless you're careful to make sure the input is
    from a trusted source. For programs that use cryptography, that's
    particularly worrying.
  </li>
  
  <p>
  <li>
    Making a class Serializable effectively means that its private fields
    are now part of its public interface, since changing those fields will
    mean that data serialized from an old version can't be deserialized into
    the new version. IMHO much of the point of making fields private is so
    that you can change them without any compatibility problems.
    This can be fixed to some extent by writing explicit readObject/writeObject
    methods that use a fixed format, but maintaining those methods then
    becomes a hassle.
  </li>
  
  <p>
  <li>
    Not implementing Serializable doesn't make it impossible for someone
    who needs serialization to use my classes. If their class has a field
    holding an instance of mine, they can override read/writeObject to get
    its state using public methods.
  </li>
</ul>


<h3><a name="i_applets" href="#index_implementation">Applets</a></h3>

<p>
<i>Can Cryptix be used in applets?</i>

<p>
It depends. Generally, applets are code downloaded from a remote
machine. They can therefore be intercepted and replaced as they travel
from the remote machine to the local machine.  Adding strong
crypto of the sort included in Cryptix does not protect against
this in any way, as it it would be relatively easy for an attacker
to change the applet in some way (applets can be decompiled, and
the crypto code is published) to disable or subvert the crypto.

<p>
This problem is lessened (not eliminated) when using signed applets.
If <i>all</i> of the following conditions are true, it could be useful to
rely on the Cryptix library in an applet: 
<ul>
  <li> the user has installed Cryptix locally, and is confident that
       their copy of it has not been tampered with.
  <li> the applet is signed, and the user has some reason to trust the
       signer.
  <li> the browser supports signed applets.
  <li> the applet doesn't rely for its security on any parameters given
       on the HTML page (it is possible for an attacker to copy the
       applet, with its signature intact, but change these parameters).
</ul>

<p>
The reason why Cryptix must be installed locally, apart from the
download time, is that some of its classes are in the java.security
package, and most browsers will not let applets define classes whose
names start with "<samp>java.</samp>".
 
<p>
HotJava's support for signed applets is (at the time of writing) more
a proof-of-concept than anything else. In particular its key
management is not currently robust enough to use for anything very
significant [IMHO --<a href="mailto:david.hopwood@lmh.ox.ac.uk">David</a>].
Netscape 4.0 is looking promising, but note that the first few releases
of browsers that support signed applets are likely to have bugs in that
support.

<p>
Most of the applications written to date require complete security over an
insecure network, including the existence of aggressive attackers.
It is for this reason that we are skeptical about the use of Cryptix
for applets.  Your mileage may vary.


<h3><a name="i_native" href="#index_implementation">Use of Native Code</a></h3>

<p>
<i>Why is native code used, rather than pure Java or Perl?</i>

<p>
Cryptix 1.x required native libraries because no pure Java (or Perl) code
was written for the cryptographic algorithms, and because Java 1.0.2 did
not have bignum (arbitrary length integer) support built-in.

<p>
Cryptix-Java 2.2 and later have pure Java versions for all algorithms. The
performance of these is adequate for most purposes, but it can be improved
on by also supporting optional native code. Currently this has been written
(but not yet released) for the Blowfish, IDEA, LOKI91, SAFER, and Square
ciphers, and for the HAVAL and RIPEMD128/160 message digests.

<p>
In 3.x the treatment of native libraries is as follows:

<p>
If a native library is available for a particular algorithm and platform
(i.e. it is in the <samp>cryptix-lib/bin</samp> directory), it will be used
automatically. There is an option in the <samp>Cryptix.properties</samp>
file that can be used to disable the search for native libraries, in case
it causes problems for a particular VM.

<p>
The target VM must support JNI (the Java Native Interface), in order for
native code to be used.

<p>
[<i>Tables 1 and 2 will contain benchmarks of Java vs. native code for
each algorithm; these have not been compiled yet.</i>]

<h3><a name="i_namespace" href="#index_implementation">The Java namespace</a></h3>

<p>
<i>Why is the Java namespace as it is?</i>

<p>
In older releases of Cryptix-Java (pre-2.2)
there were elements of the classes inside the
<samp>java.crypt</samp>, <samp>java.math</samp> and <samp>cryptix</samp>
namespaces.

<p>
Cryptix-Java V2.2 migrated to a local hierarchy of <i>cryptix</i>:

<blockquote>
   <table width=300 border=1>
   <tr align=center bgcolor="#D0D0FF">
     <td width=150><b>Pre-2.2</b> <td width=150><b>2.2</b>
   <tr align=center>
     <td> java.math      <td> cryptix.math
   <tr align=center>
     <td> java.crypt     <td> cryptix.security
   <tr align=center>
     <td> java.crypt.rsa <td> cryptix.security.rsa
   </table>
   <p>
   <b><i>Table 3: Namespace changes in V2.2</i></b>
</blockquote>

<p>
Version 3.x has a completely different structure, and the three
packages above have been deprecated.

<p>
The International JCE implementation lives in <samp>java.security.*</samp>
and <samp>java.security.interfaces.*</samp>, just like JavaSoft's early-access
release. According to the JCE 1.2 preview APIs, the encryption classes (i.e.
those that are not exportable from the U.S.) will move to <samp>javax.crypto</samp>,
and IJCE will change to follow the same pattern.

<p>
A few notes on other choices follow.

<p>
Cryptix should live in its own namespace
(as opposed to, for example, "systemics")
because it is a community resource.
A lot of the work in original coding was done by
people on the net, and Systemics' main assistance is in packaging.
The long term goal was always to have a team of
developers maintain, update and publish it independently of Systemics.
This goal has been mostly realised in the current release, which
includes the substantial efforts of the Cryptix Development Team,
as distinct from Systemics.

<p>
Another issue is the convention of COM.company as a namespace to
guarantee uniqueness.  The original developers of Cryptix have
adamantly rejected this <i>Berkeleyism</i> in a general distaste
of mixing namespaces arbitrarily.  More specifically, the Cryptix
Development Team don't have a unique (or otherwise) domain address,
and might not in the future.  Conspiracy theorists will also wish to
note the strong causal link of TLAs from .COM to NIC to SAIC to NSA ...


<h3><a name="i_rsa_example" href="#index_implementation">RSA Examples</a></h3>

<p>
<i>I cannot find any examples on RSA?</i>

<p>
Cryptix-Java 2.2 includes some fine RSA examples
in <samp>cryptix.examples</samp> (thanks Patrick).

<p>
Earlier releases had no examples;
you were supposed to do it all from the theory.
For those with no access to the relevant information,
here is a scanned-in page of the relevant
<a href="guide/cryptix/RSA.html">
RSA section</a>
from Bruce Schneier's <cite>Applied Cryptography</cite>,
used with permission.

<p>
As part of the JCE support, Cryptix-Java 3.x and later have an additional
RSA implementation which uses <samp>java.math.BigInteger</samp>; this does
not have any examples yet.


<h3><a name="i_sun_bignum" href="#index_implementation">JavaSoft's BigInteger</a></h3>

<p>
<i>Is Cryptix going to move over to JavaSoft's BigInteger?</i>

<p>
Yes. New code (for example the El Gamal implementation) is being written
to use this class in preference to <samp>cryptix.math.BigInteger</samp>. For the
time being, <samp>cryptix.math.BigInteger</samp> will be kept - the reasons for
doing this include:

<ul>
  <li> maintaining compatibility with release 2.2 of Cryptix.
  <li> <samp>java.math.BigInteger</samp> is not widely available in other
       versions of Java (many other implementations such as Kaffe are still
       v1.0.2)
  <li> There is additional value in having an independent implementation.
</ul>

<p>
In release 2.2.0a and later, <samp>cryptix.math.BigInteger</samp> has
methods <code>toJavaMathBigInteger</code> and <code>fromJavaMathBigInteger</code>,
that can be used to convert from one format to another. This conversion
isn't terribly efficient, though.


<h3><a name="i_sun_1.1" href="#index_implementation">Java 1.1</a></h3>

<p>
<i>What about the new Java 1.1 language specification?</i>

<p>
There are three new features of Java 1.1 that Cryptix can make use of:

<ul>
  <li> the <a href="guide/security/CryptoSpec.html">Java Cryptography Architecture</a>
       (the part of <samp>java.security.*</samp> that is exportable from the United
       States),
  <li> the <samp>java.math.BigInteger</samp> class,
  <li> the ZIP compression utilities in <samp>java.util.zip.*</samp>.
</ul>

<p>
Releases of Cryptix up to 2.2 do not use any Java 1.1 features, and are reported to compile
and run under both Java 1.1 and Java 1.0.2 (although keep an eye on the <a href="#bj_des_1.1">bugs</a>).


<h3><a name="i_cryptix3_compat" href="#index_implementation">Cryptix 3.x compatibility</a></h3>

<p>
<i>Which Java platforms can Cryptix 3.x be used on?</i>

<p>
Cryptix 3.x will run on both Java 1.0.2 and Java 1.1, but can only be recompiled
on Java 1.1. When it is running on a 1.0.2 VM, the following features are not supported:

<ul>
  <li> Some of the <samp>java.security.*</samp> classes (
       <samp><a href="doc/java.security.Certificate.html">Certificate</a></samp>,
       <samp><a href="doc/java.security.DigestInputStream.html">DigestInputStream</a></samp>,
       <samp><a href="doc/java.security.DigestOutputStream.html">DigestOutputStream</a></samp>,
       <samp><a href="doc/java.security.Identity.html">Identity</a></samp>,
       <samp><a href="doc/java.security.IdentityScope.html">IdentityScope</a></samp>,
       <samp><a href="doc/java.security.SecureRandom.html">SecureRandom</a></samp>, and
       <samp><a href="doc/java.security.Signer.html">Signer</a></samp>
       ).
  <li> The <samp>java.security.interfaces.*</samp> classes, since they rely on
       <samp>java.math.BigInteger</samp>.
  <li> The JCE-compatible
       <a href="doc/Package-cryptix.provider.rsa.html">RSA</a> and
       <a href="doc/Package-cryptix.provider.elgamal.html">ElGamal</a>
       implementations,
  <li> PGP compressed packets.
</ul>

<p>
Trying to use a class that is missing under Java 1.0.2 will result in a
<samp>NoClassDefFoundError</samp> being thrown, with the class name as a detail
message. If your application needs to use these features whenever they are available,
but fall back to another mode of operation otherwise, it can do so by catching
<samp>NoClassDefFoundError</samp>.

<p>
It is possible to supply the missing classes by unzipping the
<samp>classes.zip</samp> file included with JDK 1.1.1 or later, moving the
classfiles from the java/security/* and java/security/interfaces/* directories
to their own directory tree, and adding the root of this tree to the
classpath (<em>before</em> the Cryptix classes). This may be useful when
running Cryptix with Java implementations that do not yet support the JCA
libraries, such as Kaffe. It isn't possible for us to distribute
these classfiles with the release, since the
<a href="http://www.javasoft.com/products/jdk/1.1/jre/license.html">Java Runtime
Environment license</a> does not allow that.

<p>
Compression support and the new RSA/ElGamal implementations will still not work
correctly even if these files are on the classpath, because they rely indirectly on
native libraries that are only supplied with Java 1.1.

<p>
Note: "Java 1.1" refers to JDK 1.1.1 or later. JDK 1.1.5 is the latest bug-fix
release, and should be used in preference to the earlier releases if it is
available for your platform.

<p>
On Windows, speed is significantly improved if you install the optional JIT
performance pack. Note that for both Windows and Solaris JDKs, the JAVA_COMPILER
environment variable must be set before the JIT is enabled - see the README that
comes with it.

<p>
The Cryptix 3 release has been built and tested on these Java
platforms:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Solaris JDK 1.1.3 and 1.1.4
  <LI>
    Linux JDK 1.1.1 and 1.1.3 (on Linux and FreeBSD)
  <LI>
    Windows 95/NT JDK 1.1 to 1.1.5.
<!--
  <LI>
    Windows NT JDK 1.0.2 (with the caveats mentioned above).
  <LI>
    Windows NT Netscape 4.0.4 (support for the java.security.* classes is the same as
    in Java 1.0.2).
-->
</UL>

Cryptix has not been tested on any web browsers other than Netscape 4.0.4 (where
it mostly works, but we don't claim support for that platform yet).


<h4><a name="i_cryptix3_22" href="#index_implementation">Compatibility with Cryptix 2.2</a></h4>

<P>
Ciphers, message digests, modes, and some support classes for
Cryptix 2.2 are now provided (since 3.0.3) in the OLD jar.

<P>
However, <em>all</em> of the classes that were in the 2.2
release are deprecated, and we recommend that you should port over
to the IJCE (see the next section) as soon as possible.

<P>
The code for the rest - RSA and PGP - is well underway, and is
anticipated for 3.0.4.
This next release should include full support for compatibility with the
2.2 release, if the 'OLD' and 'OLDPGP' JAR files are on the classpath.

<p>
Please note that 'OLDPGP' contains code that is known to be insecure, and so
it should not be put on the classpath unless you actually need it.

<P>
There is
an internal project to develop new PGP code with a completely redesigned API.
If you would like to be a beta tester for that project, send mail to
&lt;<a href="mailto:iang@systemics.com">iang@systemics.com</a>&gt;


<h3><a name="i_ijce" href="#index_implementation">The International Java Cryptography Extension</a></h3>

<i>What is the International Java Cryptography Extension?</i>

<P>
Cryptix 3 introduces the International Java Cryptography Extension,
or <i>IJCE</i> for short.
This complete, clean room implementation of the Javasoft specification
is intended to give plug & play crypto compatibility with Java crypto
from many different suppliers of cryptographic algorithms.

<P>
The IJCE includes four general cryptographic APIs (but no implementations):

<UL>
  <LI>
    <i>cipher</i> interface, for either symmetric or public-key ciphers.
  <LI>
    <i>mode</i> interface, that provides such features as feedback.
  <LI>
    <i>padding scheme</i> interface, that allows block ciphers to be used to
    encrypt any length of data.
  <LI>
    <i>message digest</i> interface.
</UL>

<P>
Onto the architecture of the IJCE,
a <i>provider</i> can be plugged in to supply crypto algorithms
such as IDEA, RSA and RIPEMD160 that meet the interface specification.
In the Cryptix 3 releases, the Cryptix provider includes
these algorithms and <a href="guide/cryptix/Support.html">more</a>
plugged into the IJCE.


<h4><a name="i_ijce_compat" href="#index_implementation">Compatibility with other implementations</a></h4>
<P>
The JCE specification is open and there are other implementations.
Also, it is envisaged that there will be many implementors of
providers, using the IJCE as a platform, or other JCEs.  It is
our intention to be conformant with the specification, and
seek to provide plug & play operation with other products.

<P>
To date, no compatibility testing has been conducted.
As there are a number of ambiguities within the specification,
some problems are to be expected.  Watch this space.

<p>
When the compatibility testing is complete,
other implementations of the JCE specification,
such as
<a href="http://java.sun.com/security/JCE1.1/earlyaccess/">JavaSoft's
JCE implementation</a>, will
not conflict with Cryptix if they are installed in the classpath at
the same time. For the current release, make sure that
JavaSoft's JCE classes are <i><b>not</b></i> on the classpath.


<P>
Known differences from JavaSoft's version are listed
<a href="guide/ijce/JCEDifferences.html">here</a>.


<h4><a name="i_ijce_102" href="#index_implementation">Compatibility with Java 1.0.2</a></h4>

As mentioned earlier, the following classes are not supported when IJCE is running on
Java 1.0.2:

<ul>
  <li> Some of the <samp>java.security.*</samp> classes (
       <samp><a href="doc/java.security.Certificate.html">Certificate</a></samp>,
       <samp><a href="doc/java.security.DigestInputStream.html">DigestInputStream</a></samp>,
       <samp><a href="doc/java.security.DigestOutputStream.html">DigestOutputStream</a></samp>,
       <samp><a href="doc/java.security.Identity.html">Identity</a></samp>,
       <samp><a href="doc/java.security.IdentityScope.html">IdentityScope</a></samp>,
       <samp><a href="doc/java.security.SecureRandom.html">SecureRandom</a></samp>, and
       <samp><a href="doc/java.security.Signer.html">Signer</a></samp>
       ).
  <li> The <samp>java.security.interfaces.*</samp> classes, since they rely on
       <samp>java.math.BigInteger</samp>.
</ul>

The rest of <samp>java.security.*</samp> is fully supported.

<P>
Future versions may drop support for Java 1.0.2,
so you should plan to move to Java 1.1 soon.

<h2><a name="team" href="#index_team">Working with the Team</a></h2>

<h3><a name="t_future" href="#index_team">Future Directions</a></h3>

<p>
Cryptix development is storming ahead.
Here are some of the features the team is busy with:

<ul>
  <li> Expanding the IJCE as experience builds and feedback comes in.
  <li> Providing a fully functional PGP-compatible engine to
       be used by applications (includes the addition of
       new  algorithms)</li>.
  <li> A complete implementation of Netscape's Secure Sockets Layer</li>.
  <li> New public key implementations are happening</li>.
  <li> Adding new ciphers</li>.
  <li> Creating native code to plug into and speed up Cryptix</li>.
</ul>

<p>
If you would like to help add something to Cryptix,
announce your intentions on the
<a href="#d_mail">mailgroups</a>
or get in touch with
<a href="mailto:info@systemics.com">Systemics</a>.
That way we can avoid duplicating effort,
and can enhance Cryptix even further!


<h3><a name="t_add" href="#index_team">Can you add the XYZ algorithm?</a></h3>

<p>
The team is adding algorithms with every new release.  There is no
particular schedule for this, as there is now a full set of basic
algorithms.  The biggest hole is the lack of choice
in public key cryptography, and the team is working hard on this.

<p>
You can always add according to your needs, and you can also publish
an alternative release.  Indeed we would hope that you share with the
free world any improvements.

<p>
If, however, you find yourself needing a certain part that is not included,
and you think it is more efficient for a team member to do it,
then contact us.  We are always willing to
adjust priorities for some financial incentive.
A number of features and algorithms have been added
after negotiation with interested parties.


<h3><a name="t_code" href="#index_team">Do you want help in coding the XYZ algorithm?</a></h3>

<p>
<em>Yes Please!</em> It is our intention to publish a full, open, free
strong crypto library.

<p>
Any algorithms that you can code up and get going will be gratefully
received.  We can't promise getting it into any particular release,
but we'll do our best.

<p>
<i><b>Caveat Freedom Fighters:</b></i>
some programmers live in states that do not believe in
freedom of speech and the right to communicate privately.
If you happen to live under such conditions,
then we would advise you to treat the mailgroup
as monitored communications.

<p>
In that event, you could mail any address on the home page to
establish communications, and use a PGP key for any sensitive mail.
If you have very special
problems, let us know, there may be something we can do.

<p>
<i><b>Special note for Americans:</b></i>
current interpretation of the Commerce
rules indicates that you can export printed crypto.  So, if you
happen to have some useful stuff, you can print it out and post it
to us.  Please email for a useful address of a Cryptix Development
Team member, who will scan it in and get it working.


<h3><a name="t_learn" href="#index_team">Can I help with Cryptix and learn
Java at the same time?</a></h3>

<p>
If you are learning crypto or the language,
you should be aware that in general
Cryptix is for serious crypto hacking, and whilst we
all appreciate help, this is not an ideal learning environment.

<p>
However, if you are still keen to get involved, then try one of these
strategies.

<p>
Pick an area where nobody is working heavily.  I.e., steer clear of the
IJCE and PGP areas.  These areas are moving
very fast and you will find your efforts will be overtaken very quickly,
unless you are working closely with the authors.

<p>
A good place to start is to do a secret key algorithm that has not
been done before.  Ask for a list of ones that are outstanding.  These
are nicely self-contained and have a good API to work with, as well as
generally good source and doco to help from alternative sources (see
existing algorithms and
<a href="guide/cryptix/can/CAN-3.html">CAN-3</a>).
Plus, more algorithms are always useful.

<p>
Another good possibility is to find an area that you are interested in
and write an example program, unit test or documentation for this, possibly
in co-operation with the programmer(s) working in that area.  This will
introduce you nicely into the area at an entry level, which is generally
enough for 95% of any future needs.  And these things are definitely
appreciated.


<h3><a name="t_student" href="#index_team">Is Cryptix Suitable for Student Programming?</a></h3>

<p>
Cryptix is probably not stable enough yet for short term exercises,
especially those where you want to get in, get the coding done and
get the assignment turned into marks.
Most areas are not documented to that standard,
although the core crypto is getting better, and one University has
used Cryptix for a series of exercises (that we know of).

<p>
Please note that the development team cannot provide any support
for student activities of this nature.  Notwithstanding this, tutors
on the Cryptix mailgroups would be welcome to ask questions.

<p>
In contrast,
Cryptix is probably suitable for a major project (such as is normally
required for a masters or final year undergraduate degree).
Where you have a chance to get in and read some of the code and work
out what is going on, then you will be rewarded with a good platform
for building all sorts of exotic secure applications.  Email us
with your intentions as we may be able to help.

<p>
Two final year students have found Cryptix fruitful,
one in progress and another has

<h2><a name="strong" href="#index_strong">Strength, Reliability, Etc</a></h2>

<h3><a name="s_how" href="#index_strong">How Strong Is It?</a></h3>

<p>
Uh, it would be immoral and highly naughty of us to tell you.
But here are a few "facts":

<ul>
  <li>
    Each release tends to have a range of
    <a href="#s_which">secret key algorithms</a>.
    DES in particular has been around, substantially unmolested since the
    1970s, and can be readily used to construct Triple DES (DES-EDE3) to
    avoid brute-force cracking machines commonly found in certain places.

  <p>
  <li>
    You can use either RSA or ElGamal as public key algorithms.
    RSA has been
    around since the 1970s as well, and has survived repeated efforts to
    break it.

    <P>
    The current implementation of El Gamal is very new, and would not
    be recommended for serious use just yet.  ElGamal
    as an algorithm is somewhat newer than RSA (date?),
    but has been subject to a serious amount of attention,
    including by those at RSADSI, who are generally very  careful
    to reveal shortcomings in competitive products :-)

  <p>
  <li>
    These algorithms come with the unofficial
    "mark of crypto quality" from the US Government.
    That is, Cryptix is never going to be allowed to be exported from the
    States under the current export rules.

  <p>
  <li>
    You've got the source.  So you (or someone else) can look for bad bits.
    On the other hand, there are only about 100 companies and individuals
    out there that are actively using it, and it has only been published
    since mid-1996.
  </li>
</ul>


<h3><a name="s_check" href="#index_strong">How Can I Be Sure?</a></h3>

<p>
Armed with the above pseudo-facts, there are some things you can do to
check out the situation:

<ul>
  <p>
  <li>
    Read Bruce Schneier's book <cite>Applied Cryptography</cite>, 2nd edition.
    He's also written an aggressive essay called
    <a href="http://www.counterpane.com/whycrypto.html">
    Why Cryptography Is Harder Than It Looks</a>
    which should encourage you to be particularly
    careful when using Cryptix!
  </li>

  <p>
  <li>
    Ask on some of the crypto newsgroups if there is anything good or
    bad to be said.  There are a lot of good people there, and if you offer
    some cash for some code-checking, you are bound to get some takers.

  <p>
  <li>
    Read the
    <a href="http://www.research.megasoft.com/people/cmcurtin/snake-oil-faq.html">
    Snake Oil FAQ</a>.
</ul>


<H3><A name="s_src" href="#index_strong">The Advantage of Source Availability</A></H3>

Many people wonder why the source for strong crypto should be available.
The answer is mostly to do with the high level of complexity versus the high
level of risk.  By making the source code openly available to a wide group of
people, we hope to expose bugs and weaknesses through peer review.

<p>
Here's how <a href="mailto:spector@zeitgeist.com">David Spector</a> puts it:

<blockquote><i>
<P>
        Good, safe, well-tested cryptographic security software is like
        a flu vaccine.  It must be extensively researched and tested
        to know in what kinds of situations (in the case of a vaccine,
        what strains of flu) it is appropriate to use and in which it is
        not.  The ability of software to interoperate correctly with other
        similar software is one of these tests.  Imagine a flu vaccine
        that kills you if you've ever had a polio or tetanus shot.

<P>
        Just like vaccines and other medicines, high-quality
        cryptosystems go through a rigorous set of designs, reviews,
        trials and peer-reviews before they should be trusted with your
        data (or in the case of a vaccine, your life!).

<P>
        A security system is not something you buy off the back of a truck,
        nor is it something that non-experts (such as faith healers or
        trade-magazine writers [or congressmen]) are likely to be
        expert at, so taking security advice from these so-called
        experts is a lot like going to a "psychic-surgeon"... you will
        probably not get what you expect, and most certainly will not
        get better if you are ill.

<P>
        Finally, like medicines, cryptosystems need to be re-evaluated on a
        regular basis to ensure that they are still effective, and
        are still safe to use.  Since technology (and the flu) is
        always on the move, it's a good idea to keep ones technology
        (and ones flu shots) up to date.

<H2><A name="bugs_feature" href="#index_bugs_feature">Known Bugs - Features</A></H2>

These are things that people find as bugs, but are generic
to the nature of cryptography, and are sardonically called
features by the more enlightened <tt>:-)</tt>
It helps to know of them in advance of finding them as bugs.


<H3><A name="bf_RSA_key" href="#index_bugs_feature">RSA doesn't work</A></H3>

<P>
Most of the RSA functions require a key size that matches or exceeds
the length of data block that is passed.  Some things will work with smaller
keys, but for everything to work, use a minimum key size of
<strong>384</strong> bits.

<P>
This not a bug, but a feature <tt>:))</tt>
It is also recommended by RSA themselves for some of their products.

<P>
This property of RSA also means that if you try to encrypt a piece of
data twice with different public keys of the same bit length, and the
second key is less than the first, the result will not necessarily
decrypt correctly if the corresponding private keys are used in
reverse order.
This is also not recommended because there may be cryptanalytic attacks
that apply only to this kind of multiple encryption.

<P>
A better way of doing multiple encryption in series (where
<strong>both</strong> of two private keys are needed to decrypt), is
to generate two random secret keys for a symmetric algorithm,
encrypt these separately using the public keys, and encrypt the
plaintext using each secret key in turn.
I.e. the result will be the three values:
<ul>
  <li> E<sub>RSA</sub>[P<sub>1</sub>](<i>format</i>(K<sub>1</sub>))
  <li> E<sub>RSA</sub>[P<sub>2</sub>](<i>format</i>(K<sub>2</sub>))
  <li> 
E<sub>symmetric</sub>[K<sub>2</sub>](E<sub>symmetric</sub>[K<sub>1</sub>](plaintext))),
</ul>
where P<sub>1</sub> and P<sub>2</sub> are the public keys, K<sub>1</sub>
and K<sub>2</sub> are random secret keys,
and <i>format</i> is a function that converts data to a secure block format
(for example, PKCS#1). Decryption is left as an exercise for the reader. This
can be extended to more than two RSA keys, simply by using the same number of
secret keys.


<H3><A name="bf_pgp_decrypt" href="#index_bugs_feature">PGP-encrypted data does not decrypt</A></H3>

<P>
Conventionally encrypted files from PGP by default contain compressed 
data packets, which need to be decompressed before decryption.

<P>
Alternatively, you can make sure that the data is not compressed by applying
the PGP flag
<TT>+compress=off</TT>
at the encryption phase.

<P>
Under Cryptix-Java, you need at least Java 1.1 and Cryptix-Java 2.2
for the decompression to be available.


<H3><A name="bf_sha_0" href="#index_bugs_feature">SHA gives unexpected results</A></H3>

Some users have found that SHA gives unexpected results.
This is generally because there are two variants of SHA,
and you have one but are expecting the other.

<P>
To distinguish, these are generally called SHA-1 and SHA-0.
The variant SHA-1 is based on a suggestion made by the NSA,
and is widely thought to be slightly better.  It is recommended.

<P>
In Cryptix 2.2, SHA-1 is implemented by the class
<samp>cryptix.security.SHA</samp>.
The deprecated SHA-0 is implemented by <samp>cryptix.security.SHA0</samp>,
and is present for compatibility reasons.

<p>
In Cryptix 3, you would normally construct these
message digests using
<blockquote>
    <code>MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-1")</code>, or <br>
    <code>MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-0")</code>.
</blockquote>
<samp>"SHA"</samp> can be used as an alias for <samp>"SHA-1"</samp>.

<P>
Unfortunately, in the earliest versions of Cryptix, the
programmers themselves fell into the same trap.  Cryptix-Java V1
and Cryptix-Perl V1.0 both had only the SHA-0 original algorithm
(named as <samp>SHA</samp>).

<h3><a name="bj_jdk12" href="#index_bugs_java">Cryptix V3 fails on JDK 1.2 betas</a></h3>

In order to coexist properly with the JDK 1.1 security API, the International JCE had
to use a non-public method of that API, <code>Security.getProviderProperty</code>.
This method returns a different type in JDK 1.2 beta 2, so IJCE will not work in
that version of the JDK.

<p>
We are working on this problem, and it will be solved by Cryptix 3.0.4.


<h3><a name="bj_rawcipher" href="#index_bugs_java">RawRSACipher or RawElGamalCipher sometimes throws an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException (V3)</a></h3>

Between Cryptix 3.0 and 3.0.2 inclusive, the classes
<samp>cryptix.provider.rsa.RawRSACipher</samp> and
<samp>cryptix.provider.elgamal.RawElGamalCipher</samp> had bugs which caused them
to throw an <samp>ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</samp> in some cases.
Instances of these classes are returned if you use <code>Cipher.getInstance("RSA")</code>
or <code>Cipher.getInstance("ElGamal")</code>.

<p>
This will only happen for some combinations of key and input (specifically, when
the most significant bit of an output block is set, which is about a quarter of all
encryptions if both the key and plaintext are chosen randomly).

<p>
There are corrected versions of these classes in the
<a href="http://www.systemics.com/software/cryptix-java/patch/">patch directory</a>,
and the bug is fixed in 3.0.3.


<h3><a name="bj_3des" href="#index_bugs_java">T-DES encrypt sequence reversed (2.2 patch)</a></h3>

In a patch release to V2.3 called <i>iang_secret_key</i> there was
an early implementation of Triple DES.  The sequence of key usage
in the encrypt-decrypt-encrypt cycle was reversed.  As the test data
was self-generated, this error propogated instead of being caught.

<P>
The effect of this reversal was to make the code incompatible
with any other implementation.

<P>
The V3.0 DES-EDE3 implementation fixes this.  To fix the TDES.java in
the patch release, reverse the key usage in the
<code>blockEncrypt()</code>
and
<code>blockDecrypt()</code>
methods to be 1-2-3 and 3-2-1 respectively.
Note that the test data will now be wrong, get the test data from V3
(TestDES_EDE3.java) if needed.

<p>
Yes, this is a known problem. It's fixed in the current (unreleased)
source tree, but a temporary, Java 1.1-only solution is to replace the
above lines with:
  
<pre>
    byte[] ideaKey = new byte[16];
    java.security.SecureRandom random = new java.security.SecureRandom();
    random.nextBytes(ideaKey);
</pre>
  
Since this was a known bug it should really have been put in the
FAQ, though. We apologize for that not happening - it's here now.
  
<p>
Alternatively, there is a fixed <samp>ArmouredMessage</samp>, that also has the

Ian's Enigma site</a>
and also in the
<a href="http://www.systemics.com/software/cryptix-java/patch/">

<p>
If you want to read PGP messages containing compressed data, you also
need to get the updated <samp>CompressedData.java</samp> (same places). If you
haven't already got the fixed <samp>Base64.java</samp>, which allows PGP 5 to
read Cryptix messages, get that as well.

used by a web browser. The problem is that Cryptix is then considered to
be trusted code, and can do file access, so when it is installed on a
machine that also runs HotJava or Internet Explorer, untrusted applets
can do file access via Cryptix.

<p>
For instance, a few of the example programs allow arbitrary files to be
read or written to. This attack doesn't work in Netscape 3.0 or later,
because the Netscape VM requires permissions to be explicitly granted
before they can be used, but it is a potential problem for Netscape 2.x,
HotJava, and MSIE.

<p>
To fix all the security bugs found so far, upgrade to Cryptix 3.0 or
higher. These releases have been thoroughly reviewed for bugs of the type
described above, although we cannot guarantee that all of them have been fixed.

<p>
Note that Cryptix-Java was not originally designed with applets in mind -
see the comments on <a href="#i_applets">applets and security</a>.


<h3><a name="bj_rsa_mod" href="#index_bugs_java">RSA Mod Mul (V2)</a></h3>

<p>
The infamous mod_mul_recip bug in
Cryptix 2.x versions now has a suggested
fix.  In the file
<code>cryptix/math/BigNum.java</code>
comment out the lines shown:

<pre>
    if (val != 0)
    {
        r.len = 1;                  // HERE

        // If LONG
        // r.n[0] = val &amp; 0x7FFFFFFFL;
        // If not LONG
        r.n[0] = val &amp; 0x7FFFFFFF;  // HERE

        r.negative = (val &lt; 0);
    }
</pre>

and add the following code (only the last line in the block
survives):

<pre>
    if (val != 0)
    {
        // If LONG
        // r.n[0] = val &amp; 0x7FFFFFFFL;
        // r.len = 1;
        // If not LONG
        // r.n[0] = val &amp; 0x7FFFFFFF;

        //
        // only 30bits uses NOT 31 !!
        //
        if ( (val &amp; 0x40000000) == 0 )
        {
            r.n[0] = val &amp; 0x3FFFFFFF;
            r.len = 1;
        }
        else
        {
            int[] t = r.n;
            if ( t.length &lt; 2 )
            {
                t = r.n = new int[2];
            }
            t[0] = val &amp; 0x3FFFFFFF;
            t[1] = 1;
            r.len = 2;
        }

        r.negative = (val &lt; 0);
    }
</pre>

<p>
This is due to the big number only using 30 bits per int,
not 31 bits (which is how many bits of magnitude there are in a 32 bit int).

<p>
We haven't seen any mod_mul_recip bugs for a long time, so
Mike has earnt lots of beers.


<h3><a name="bj_des_1.1" href="#index_bugs_java">DES fails tests (V2 - Java 1.1)</a></h3>

<p>
DES compiled under the later compiler versions
seems to enforce the type rules more rigourously
(Java 1.1 and some non-Sun tools such as Kaffe).

<p>
A new DES class that fixes a number of bugs with a variety of tools
is available in the
<a href="http://www.systemics.com/software/cryptix-java/patch/">patches
directory</a>.
The test code in this class acts differently as it is
rewritten to go with unit tests coming in forthcoming releases
(see the iang_secret_patch2.zip), but should be compatible
otherwise.

<p>
If you want to change the source yourself, look for the method returns of longs
(there are 4 lines to look for) and change this:

<pre>
    return l &lt;&lt; 32<big><strong>L</strong></big> | r &amp; 0xFFFFFFFFL;
</pre>

to

<pre>
    return <big><strong>(long)</strong></big>l &lt;&lt; 32 | r &amp; 0xFFFFFFFFL;
</pre>
  
<p>
Notice the useless 32L as well as the cast of <b><i>l</i></b> (that's ell for left,
not the number 1).
This is fixed in Cryptix 3.x

  
<h3><a name="bj_hash_data" href="#index_bugs_java">Occasional hash is wrong (V2.0)</a></h3>

If the length of the data being hashed is 64<i>x</i>+55 bytes long,
then the hash returned will be wrong.
The problem is in the following functions
of <samp>java.crypt.MD5</samp> and <samp>java.crypt.SHA</samp>:

<pre>
    private byte[] java_digest()
    {
        ...
        if (pos <strong>&gt;=</strong> (DATA_LENGTH-8))
</pre>

To fix, simply drop the equality condition to:

<pre>
        if (pos <big><strong>&gt;</strong></big> (DATA_LENGTH-8))
</pre>

<p>
Both MD5 and SHA are affected. This is fixed in 2.2 and later.


<h3><a name="bj_cr_nl" href="#index_bugs_java">Secret encryption won't decrypt (V2.0)</a></h3>

<p>
If you are using a Microsoft platform, the test program in
<samp>cryptix.examples</samp>
will fail.  This is due to it filtering the data as text,
which results in the OS converting NL to CR/NL.


<h3><a name="bj_str_int" href="#index_bugs_java">String Integers are incorrect (V1.1)</a></h3>

<p>
In V1.1, the <code>BigInteger.toString()</code>
method sometimes returns incorrect values.  For example:

<pre>
    BigInteger a = new BigInteger(1000);
    BigInteger b = new BigInteger(900);
    BigInteger r = new BigInteger;
    r.mul(a, b);
    System.out.println("Result: "+r);
</pre>

gives 1293216 as a result.  Other values work fine.

<p>
To fix the source, modify the toString method in BigInteger.java, 
changing the following line from:

<pre>
    returnBuffer.append( buffer[0] &amp; 0x0F );
</pre>

to:

<pre>
    returnBuffer.append( hexToAscii( buffer[0] &amp; 0x0F ) );
</pre>


<p><hr>
<h3><a name="bugs_perl" href="#index_bugs_perl">Bugs - Perl</a></h3>


<h3><a name="bp_5004" href="#index_bugs_perl">Prime Tests fail (Perl 5.004)</a></h3>

<p>
After upgrading to Perl 5.004, a bug appeared in
<samp>BigInteger::Math::TestPrime</samp>,
that causes some of the tests to fail.
 
<p>
The bug is in the files
<samp>Math-Systemics/Math/TestPrime.pm</samp> and
<samp>Crypt-Systemics/Crypt/RSASecretKeyPair.pm</samp>.
The line:

<pre>
    Math::BigInteger::mod_exp($r, $x, $p1, $p) <big><strong>|| return 0</strong></big>;  
</pre>

should be changed to:

<pre>
    Math::BigInteger::mod_exp($r, $x, $p1, $p);
</pre>
 
since mod_exp doesn't return a value (and in Perl 5.004 this
is what actually happens).


<H3><A name="bp_comp_gcc" href="#index_bugs_perl">Compile error (gcc)</A></H3>

Using <code>gcc</code>
might give compile errors
complaining about undefined
<tt>u_int16_t, u_int32_t</tt>
within DES and IDEA.

<P>
One fix is to add this include directive at the top of
the <tt>des.h</tt> and <tt>idea.h</tt> header files:
  
<pre>
        #include &lt;sys/bitypes.h&gt;
</pre> 
  
If this (portability) file is not on your system, you will need to
hand craft something that specifies the types.  It would look something
like this (from Linux):

<pre>
        typedef /*signed*/ char            int8_t;
        typedef unsigned char            u_int8_t;
        typedef short                     int16_t;
        typedef unsigned short          u_int16_t;
        typedef int                       int32_t;
        typedef unsigned int            u_int32_t;
        typedef long long                 int64_t;
        typedef unsigned long long      u_int64_t;
</pre>

<P>  
This issue has been reported (and this fix works) on
Solaris 2.4, 2.5 and DEC OSF 3.2.
  
<P>
(Thanks, David).

   <b><i>Table 6: Applications using Cryptix</i></b>
</blockquote>

<p>
Others are in the pipeline.  If you wish to add your application to
the list, let us know.


<h3><a name="a_supply" href="#index_appl">Should my application supply Cryptix?</a></h3>

<p>
Probably, for these two reasons:  Firstly, users in general don't have
Cryptix on their machines, and you don't want separate detailed
instructions that tell the user where to get it.  Secondly, you need
to guarantee that the right version is installed.


<h3><a name="a_border" href="#index_appl">Where does Cryptix stop and applications start?</a></h3>

<p>
If the code is about strong crypto, and is generic in its applicability,
then it can probably go in Cryptix.
Cryptix doesn't and shouldn't really include any application code.
By this, we mean that Cryptix is a developers tool, and is not
intended to be useful directly for end-users.

<p>
These are some of the areas where we include developer library
code that is a user of crypto:

<ul>
  <li> <b>SSL.</b>
    A forthcoming developer library is the SSL web security protocol.

  <p>
  <li> <b>PGP.</b>
    Our old favourite is PGP.

  <p>
  <li> <b>Tests.</b>
    Included are a bunch of programs that demonstrate the usage
    of the code, as well as test their operations.  But these would not
    be rigourous users of the classes in the sense of applications, lacking
    for example, error handling.
</ul>

Cryptix is evolving into a library of cryptographic tools and secure
protocols.

<p><hr>
<h2><a name="performance" href="#index_performance">Performance</a></h2>

<p>
Performance is not a big concern with Cryptix.  Most hackers
are concerned with getting code out there right now
if not sooner.  And most applications run on machines like PCs that
these days munch through crypto as if it wasn't there.

<p>
However, there are still some good reasons for considering performance.
Sometimes, you need to know whether your application needs to use
the high performance options such as C or assembler - if you can get
away without it this means big savings in complexity and hassle.

<p>
(Note that Cryptix-Java V2.2 does not use C or assembler, but V3 has
optional native libraries. All releases of Cryptix-Perl use C.)

<p>
Performance programs make great examples, as they clearly
show how to use the algorithm without getting into real-life
considerations that tend to obscure things.  It's also got
to be said that speed of one's favourite algorithm is a competitive
ego-inflating sport, of which we need many more on the Internet <tt>:))</tt>

<p>
What follows are those
<a href="http://www.systemics.com/docs/cryptix/CAN-index.html">Cryptix
Application Notes</a> (CANs) that cover
the issue of performance and tuning.  Actually that is most of them
but that is not really the issue ...

<h3><a name="p_hash" href="#index_performance">Hashes</a></h3>

<p>
In <a href="http://www.systemics.com/docs/cryptix/CAN-1.html">CAN-1</a>,
author
<a href="mailto:raif@FL.NET.AU">Raif Naffah</a>
compares the speed of several hash functions.

<h3><a name="p_block" href="#index_performance">Block Ciphers</a></h3>

<p>
In detail, <a href="http://www.systemics.com/docs/cryptix/CAN-2.html">CAN-2</a>
compares the speed of several symmetric block ciphers.

<h3><a name="p_asym" href="#index_performance">Public Key Algorithms</a></h3>

<p>
To do.

<h3><a name="p_still" href="#index_performance">In Search of a Faster Encrypt</a></h3>

<p>
If you are worried about performance, then you should really be
using a high performance language like C for the algorithm itself.
Real crypto-grinders like to hand code the inner loops in assembler,
spending 100s of man-hours looking for savings of cycles.  Of course,
hardware is where it's really at...

<p>
If, however, you really want a faster algorithm in Java,
<a href="http://www.systemics.com/docs/cryptix/CAN-3.html">CAN-3</a>
describes how the author speeded up the LOKI91 algorithm
by a factor of 20, taking it from the worst to the equal best.

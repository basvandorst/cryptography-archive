Although the implementation of web-of-trust in the current experimental beta
seems fine, I don't think I've mentioned one major failing it has now--that
to authenticate posted messages on newsgroups one needs to keep a key ring
as big as all the users one might wish to authenticate. Actually one shouls
also call each one to check his signature (if one follows the instruction
file Jeff posted). In the limit one would need to do this for everyone who
posts authenticated (signed) messages.

This is obviously absurd, as well as making a mockery of Ripem/SIG.

Thus a method is needed to manage certificates signed by a very few
authenticators--not self-signed alone. Such signers can be kept in one's
public key file and then every posted message which is signed by such an
authentication signer can be checked without this monkey business of -v, or
calling people up, or keeping keys for each person one might wish to
authenticate.

There is, of course, a well-established method of doing this. It's called
PEM. :-)

Mac Ripem not only uses it, but also will load the most common signer
keys (RSA Persona, RSA Unaffiliated User Heirarchy, etc.) into one's key
files on requests.

Shouldn't Ripem get with the program? Although direct trust is a good
addition, it would, I think, be very unfortunate if the next version of
Ripem doesn't also include both PEM and compatibility with Mac Ripem in PEM
mode.

Now that PGP is U.S.-legal in the MIT version, and a European interoperable
version has already shown itself, Ripem's only advantage (and
that won't last too long) is PEM. It would be sad if Ripem loses that
advantage, that Ray Lau has given to Mac Ripem, while trying to catch up to
web-of-trust.

I know I've discussed pieces of this before, but it's only recently that it
hit me that if one goes only with direct trust, one needs a humongous public
keyfile and constant checking of signatures to add them. Meanwhile, the
servers seem to be going away, so that approach to checking seems to be
leaving as well--seems to me that someone is shooting himself in the foot,
here.

If this is all handled, and I don't understand the situation, please don't
hesitate to say something. But at the moment, there doesn't seem to be any
way for Ripem to do the PEM number, and it won't read PEM MacRipem messages,
claiming that one is not on the list of recipients.

My recollection is a bit vague, but the digest does not depend
on the multiply routine, no?

Right. I'm confused. In fact, I can't even reproduce it after trying
RIPEM 1.3a3 on four different platforms.

It could be some sort of memory corruption thing. When I get a chance 
I'll "Purify" the RSAREF library and see what I can find out by going 
that route.

Since I have an account on netcom, I tried it.

Yes, when compiling on netcom I get 
Warning: problem encountered with public key of "test":
  Public key of 'test' is garbled--digest does not match.
and make test fails

In fact, I still get the error if I back out of my patch to nn.c via 
patch -R. 

and I get same error with ripem 1.3a2 on netcom.

I agree entirely.  With PGP legal, PEM is RIPEM's only advantage.
And RIPEM doesn't even do PEM (except the Mac version).
With MIME/PEM arguably slated to overtake PEM, Jeff T. is working 
on adding MIME/PEM to RIPEM.  If he or someone else doesn't
do that or at least add PEM support, then RIPEM doesn't have
much to offer anymore and should quietly go away.
Actually, if we don't make any more progress from where we
are now, I would prefer that RIPEM die, rather than linger
on to muddy the waters.

But, I believe that Jeff is hard at work on RIPEM 2.0, and
there should be good stuff in it.  PEM interoperability 
would be very nice, but I think he's concentrating on 
MIME/PEM.

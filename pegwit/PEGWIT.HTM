<p> Pegwit is a program for performing public key encryption
and authentication. It uses elliptic curves over GF(143), and
a symmetric block cipher called square. It is free, you may do
what you like with it, but if you make changes, please use 
a different name to avoid confusion. It is possible that using
pegwit may infringe U.S. patents, I don't know.

<p> <a href="pegwit.exe"> pegwit.exe</a> is a Windows 95 executable.

<p> Run pegwit with no parameters to get help.
Basically the -i option is used to create your public key,
-e encrypts, -d decrypts, -s signs, -v verifies a signature.

<p> If you can read zip files you can download all the sources
by pressing <a href="crypto.zip"> here.</a>

<p> The source containing main
is <a href="pegwit.cpp"> pegwit.cpp</a>. The other sources are
  <a href="ncurve.hpp">ncurve.hpp</a>,
  <a href="ncurve.cpp">ncurve.cpp</a>,
  <a href="prime.hpp">prime.hpp</a>,
  <a href="prime.cpp">prime.cpp</a>,
  <a href="vlong.hpp">vlong.hpp</a>,

  <a href="square.h"> square.h</a>
  <a href="square.c"> square.c</a> and
  <a href="square.tab"> square.tab</a>

<p> pegwit.cpp makes use of the standard "C" library (stdio.h,
string.h,time.h) the other sources are pure C/C++.

<p> You may wish to have batch files which actually invoke
pegwit for private key operations, so that a good length pass 
phrase can be used. In you do this then the batch files could
themselves be encrypted with a different (shorter) pass phrase. 
A utility to securely delete the batch file would be useful.

<p> However the physical security of your computer is still 
important,since if it is not secure, an attacker can in principal
modify the software to do anything at all.

<p> If you port pegwit to other systems, please let me know.

         <h1> ONB version </h1>
<body>

There is a test program <a href="ctest.cpp">ctest.cpp</a>,
elliptic curves
  <a href="curve.hpp">curve.hpp</a>,
  <a href="curve.cpp">curve.cpp</a>
and the underlying Galois fields
  <a href="field.hpp">field.hpp</a>,
  <a href="field.cpp">field.cpp</a>and
  <a href="root.cpp">root.cpp</a>.

<p> You also need
  <a href="prime.hpp">prime.hpp</a> ,
  <a href="prime.cpp">prime.cpp</a> ,
  <a href="vlong.hpp">vlong.hpp</a> and
  <a href="vlong.cpp">vlong.cpp.</a>.

<p> The difficult part of Elliptic curve cryptography is finding
a suitable a curve and a point on the curve of prime order.
My software uses Weil's theorem to generate points with various
prime orders. <a href="findlk.cpp">findlk.cpp</a> is a program
which computes possible values for l,k in the when calling
the constructor for weil_curve.
  <a href="findlk.out">findlk.out</a> is the output.
See curve.hpp or ctest.cpp for values which I have tested.
It seems k needs to be prime and greater than l to get
good results.

<p> For fields GF(2^m), the software uses an optimal normal
basis (typeI or II) if possible, otherwise a polynomial basis,
which is much slower. I also support curves over GF(p), but there
is no software provided to generate suitable curves with points
of known order for this case.

<p> Changes

<p> Change(1) I solved the problem of mapping elements
of GF(2^l) -> GF(2^l*k) in a more general way than my first
version.

<p> Change(2) I have added code for changing between different
bases for GF(2^m).

<p> Change(3) (3rd Jan 97) The restriction that GF(2^l) have an
ONB was unnecessary, for example l=7,k=17 is ok. The files findlk.cpp
and findlk.out have been updated to reflect this.

<p> Rough edges - The handling of random numbers might be better if
a range was specified in the call rng::next. Also it would be convenient
if a pointer to a rng was associated with each field - there is already
a data member for this purpose, which is only used in the basis change code.
It should be initialised in the constructor calls.

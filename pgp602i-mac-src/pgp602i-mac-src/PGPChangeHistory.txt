PGP 6.0.2 Change HistoryWindows & MacintoshAdded: The last PGP 2.X feature that never made it into modern PGP has finally been added to 6.0.2: For Your Eyes Only.  However, we can't call it that for legal reasons, so the name of the feature is Secure Viewer.  It is however compatible with the feature previously known as FYEO in old versions.  Secure Viewer has been written to handle the issues of modern OSs, and even uses a TEMPEST attack prevention font to display the message.Added: Forcing the Recipient Dialog can now be accomplished by holding down a modifier key in the email plugin to show the recipient dialog even in cases where the recipients are all valid.

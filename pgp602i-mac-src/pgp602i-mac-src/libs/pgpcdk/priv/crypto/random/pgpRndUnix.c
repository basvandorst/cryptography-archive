Each possibility * can be specifically enabled or disabled by predefining USE_XX to 1 * or 0.  For some, the code attempts to detect availability automatically. * If the symbols HAVE_XX are defined, they are used.  If not, they are set * to reasonable defaults while other clues are checked.  The choices, * and the auto-detection methods used, are: * - gethrtime(), if HAVE_GETHRTIME is set to 1. * - clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME,...), if CLOCK_REALTIME is in <time.h> * - gettimeofday(), assumed available unless HAVE_GETTIMEOFDAY=0 * - getitimer(ITIMER_REAL,...), if ITIMER_REAL is defined in <sys/time.h> * - ftime(), assumed available unless HAVE_FTIME=0 * * These are all accessed through the gettime(), timetype, and tickdiff() * macros.  The MINTICK constant is something to avoid the gettimeofday() * glitch wherein it increments the return value even if no tick has occurred. * When measuring the tick interval, if the difference between two successive * times is not at least MINTICK ticks, it is ignored. */#ifndef TIME_WITH_SYS_TIME#define TIME_WITH_SYS_TIME 1	/* Assume true if not told */#endif/* * Include <time.h> and <sys/time.h> */#if HAVE_SYS_TIME_H#include <sys/time.h>#if TIME_WITH_SYS_TIME#include <time.h>#endif#else#include <time.h>#endif#include <sys/types.h>#include <sys/times.h>	/* for times() */#include <stdlib.h>	/* For qsort() */#include "pgpRnd.h"#include "pgpRandomContext.h"#include "pgpUsuals.h"#ifndef USE_GETHRTIME#define USE_GETHRTIME HAVE_GETHRTIME#endif#if USE_GETHRTIMEtypedef hrtime_t timetype;#define gettime(s) (*(s) = gethrtime())#define tickdiff(s,t) ((s)-(t))#define MINTICK 0#else#ifndef USE_CLOCK_GETTIME#ifndef HAVE_CLOCK_GETTIME#define HAVE_CLOCK_GETTIME 1#endif#if HAVE_CLOCK_GETTIME#ifdef CLOCK_REALTIME#define USE_CLOCK_GETTIME 1#endif#endif#endif#if USE_CLOCK_GETTIME#define CHOICE_CLOCK_GETTIME 1typedef struct timespec timetype;#define gettime(s) (void)clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME, s)#define tickdiff(s,t) (((s).tv_sec-(t).tv_sec)*1000000000 + \	(s).tv_nsec - (t).tv_nsec)#ifndef HAVE_CLOCK_GETRES#define HAVE_CLOCK_GETRES 1#endif#else#ifndef USE_GETTIMEOFDAY#ifndef HAVE_GETTIMEOFDAY#define HAVE_GETTIMEOFDAY 1	/* Assume we have it... */#endif#define USE_GETTIMEOFDAY HAVE_GETTIMEOFDAY#endif#if USE_GETTIMEOFDAYtypedef struct timeval timetype;#define gettime(s) (void)gettimeofday(s, (struct timezone *)0)#define tickdiff(s,t) (((s).tv_sec-(t).tv_sec)*1000000+(s).tv_usec-(t).tv_usec)#define MINTICK 1#else#ifndef USE_GETITIMER#ifndef HAVE_GETITIMER#define HAVE_GETITIMER 1#endif#ifndef HAVE_SETITIMER#define HAVE_SETITIMER 1#endif#if HAVE_GETITIMER && HAVE_SETITIMER#ifdef ITIMER_REAL#define USE_GETITIMER 1#endif#endif#endif#if USE_GETITIMER#define CHOICE_GETITIMER 1#include <signal.h>	/* For signal(), SIGALRM, SIG_IGN  */typedef struct itimerval timetype;#define gettime(s) (void)getitimer(ITIMER_REAL, s)/* Subtract *backwards* because timer is counting *down* */#define tickdiff(s,t) (((t).it_value.tv_sec-(s).it_value.tv_sec)*1000000 + \	(t).it_value.tv_usec - (s).it_value.tv_usec)#define MINTICK 1#else#ifndef USE_FTIME#ifndef HAVE_FTIME#define HAVE_FTIME 1#endif#ifndef HAVE_SYS_TIMEB_H#define HAVE_SYS_TIMEB_H 1#endif#define USE_FTIME HAVE_FTIME && HAVE_SYS_TIMEB_H#endif#if USE_FTIME#include <sys/timeb.h>typedef struct timeb timetype;#define gettime(s) (void)ftime(s)#define tickdiff(s,t) (((s).time-(t).time)*1000 + (s).millitm - (t).millitm)#define MINTICK	0#else#error No clock available#endif /* USE_FTIME */#endif /* USE_GETITIMER */#endif /* USE_GETTIMEOFDAY */#endif /* USE_CLOCK_GETTIME */#endif /* USE_GETHRTIME */#if CHOICE_CLOCK_GETTIME && HAVE_CLOCK_GETRESstatic unsignedranTickSize(void){	struct timespec res;	clock_getres(CLOCK_REALTIME, &res);	return (unsigned)res.tv_nsec;}#else /* Normal clock resolution estimation */#if NOISEDEBUG#include <stdio.h>#endif#define N 15	/* Number of deltas to try (at least 5, preferably odd) *//* Function needed for qsort() */static intranCompare(void const *p1, void const *p2){	return *(unsigned const *)p1 > *(unsigned const *)p2 ?  1 :	       *(unsigned const *)p1 < *(unsigned const *)p2 ? -1 : 0;}/* * Find the resolution of the high-resolution clock by sampling successive * values until a tick boundary, at which point the delta is entered into * a table.  An average near the median of the table is taken and returned * as the system tick size to eliminate outliers due to descheduling (high) * or tv0 not being the "zero" time in a given tick (low). * * Some trickery is needed to defeat the habit systems have of always * incrementing the microseconds field from gettimeofday() results so that * no two calls return the same value.  Thus, a "tick boundary" is assumed * when successive calls return a difference of more than MINTICK ticks. * (For gettimeofday(), this is set to 2 us.)  This catches cases where at * most one other task reads the clock between successive reads by this task. * More tasks in between are rare enough that they'll get cut off by the * median filter. * * When a tick boundary is found, the *first* time read during the previous * tick (tv0) is subtracted from the new time to get microseconds per tick. * * Suns have a 1 us timer, and as of SunOS 4.1, they return that timer, but * there is ~50 us of system-call overhead to get it, so this overestimates * the tick size considerably.  On SunOS 5.x/Solaris, the overhead has been * cut to about 2.5 us, so the measured time alternates between 2 and 3 us. * Some better algorithms will be required for future machines that really * do achieve 1 us granularity. * * Current best idea: discard all this hair and use Ueli Maurer's entropy * estimation scheme.  Assign each input event (delta) a sequence number. * 16 bits should be more than adequate.  Make a table of the last time * (by sequence number) each possibe input event occurred.  For practical * implementation, hash the event to a fixed-size code and consider two * events identical if they have the same hash code.  This will only ever * underestimate entropy.  Then use the number of bits in the difference * between the current sequence number and the previous one as the entropy * estimate. * * If it's desirable to use longer contexts, Maurer's original technique * just groups events into non-overlapping pairs and uses the technique on * the pairs.  If you want to increment the entropy numbers on each keystroke * for user-interface niceness, you can do the operation each time, but you * have to halve the sequence number difference before starting, and then you * have to halve the number of bits of entropy computed because you're adding * them twice. * * You can put the even and odd events into separate tables to close Maurer's * model exactly, or you can just dump them into the same table, which will * be more conservative. */static unsignedranTickSize(void){	unsigned i = 0, j = 0,  diff, d[N];	timetype tv0, tv1, tv2;	/*	 * TODO Get some per-run data to seed the RNG with.	 * pid, ppid, etc.	 */	gettime(&tv0);	tv1 = tv0;	do {		gettime(&tv2);		diff = (unsigned)tickdiff(tv2, tv1);		if (diff > MINTICK) {			d[i++] = diff;			tv0 = tv2;			j = 0;		} else if (++j >= 4096)	/* Always getting <= MINTICK units */			return MINTICK + !MINTICK;		tv1 = tv2;	} while (i < N);	/* Return average of middle 5 values (rounding up) */	qsort(d, N, sizeof(d[0]), ranCompare);	diff = (d[N/2-2]+d[N/2-1]+d[N/2]+d[N/2+1]+d[N/2+2]+4)/5;#if NOISEDEBUG	fprintf(stderr, "Tick size is %u\n", diff);#endif	return diff;}#endif /* Clock resolution measurement selection *//* * Add as much timing-dependent random noise as possible * to the randPool.

README file for PGP 5.5 Macintosh-specific source code release
==============================================================

Welcome to this source code release of PGP version 5.5. This archive
contains source code published in the following book by PGP, Inc.:

    Pretty Good Privacy (tm) 5.5
    Macintosh-Specific Source Code
    Volumes 1-5
    December 10, 1997
    ISBN 01-891064-05-3

The book was exported from USA to Europe, where it was scanned and
OCRed to make the source code available in electronic form. This may
seem like an encumbersome way of publishing software, but please see
the file PREFACE.txt for an explanation of why this approach was
necessary.

The pages were scanned using an HP ScanJet 4+ flatbed scanner with
an automatic document feeder (ADF), and the results were then proof-
read and corrected using tools published in the following book by PGP,
Inc.:

   Tools for Publishing Source Code via OCR
   November 8, 1997
   ISBN 1-891064-02-9

Please note that the PGP 5.5 source code in this archive is published
"as is". No modifications have been made to the files whatsoever. This
will let users verify the original SHA hashes signed by Philip
Zimmermann, so that they can be sure that this software is indeed the
same as the PGP 5.5 versions (both freeware and commercial) distributed
in the USA and Canada by PGP, Inc. Later we will probably publish an
"internationalized" version of this software, called PGP 5.5i, but at
this time we thought it would be best to publish the sources unmodified.

For building instructions, see the file BUILD.txt. Please note that this
archive only contains the windows-specific parts of the source code.
In order to compile PGP 5.5 for Macintosh, you will also need the
platform independent sources, which are distributed in a separate
archive. This archive can be downloaded via anonymous FTP from:

  ftp://ftp.pgpi.com/pub/pgp/

Here you will also find precompiled binaries for most platforms. The
files can also be downloaded from the International PGP Home Page at:

  http://www.pgpi.com/

The International PGP Home Page also contains lots of information about
PGP in general, including updated documentation and language modules, a
list of known bugs, answers to FAQs, etc.



Happy encrypting,

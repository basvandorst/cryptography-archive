I just downloaded and started using MacPGP 2.6.  When I first started
using it to make keys and encrypt, it indicated it needed several hundred
random bits and I should type on the keyboard until it could gather what
it needed.

Now it no longer seems to do this.  It just makes new keys, and encrypts
without asking me to use the keyboard.  Is this normal?

Where does it get the random values to generate the large prime numbers?

Why did it ask for me to type on the keyboard at first, but no longer?

Thanks for any help!

This is, in fact, a stupid and arbitrary law. Cryptographic algorithms are
not allowed to be exported from the united states because they are war
munitions, subject to ITAR. Even though this restriction is now archaic, the
government has decided to keep it in place to prevent the widespread
use of cryptography within the United States, something that would impede
our ability to prosecute both foreign and domestic criminals within the US.

It is not at all clear that ITAR applies to the distribution of programs via
the net. Recent rulings have permitted the distribution of programs on paper
and prohibited the distribution of programs on disk. The likely explanation
is that limiting the distribution of programs on paper would limit our rights
under the first amendment, but limiting the export of physical devices (disks
that just happen to contain the software) would not. Given this, it is
extremelly likely that the government could not (and therefore would not)
crack down on the distribution of cryptography via the net, but we have not
had a test case yet, and in the past the government has claimed that such
distribution is subject to serious prison terms.

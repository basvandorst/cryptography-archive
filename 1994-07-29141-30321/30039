nope.  As with all patent holders, once PKP become aware of the 
infringement, it had only the choices of litigating the patent, licensing
the patent or risking losing it due to failure to defend it.  I imagine
that they took a look at Zimmerman, realized that he was unworthy of the
cost of a suit, also realized that it would be a practical impossiblity
to prosecute all the other infringers, and simply wrote off their 
losses with a zero cost license.  I suppose it makes the Robin Hood 
types (thieves) happy but it didn't accomplish one of the main goals
and that was to invalidate software patents in general and public key
patents in particular.  And it leaves everyone involved morally
dirty.

If I steal a Chevy from General Motors because I believe them to be the
evil corporation incarnate and don't get caught, am I in the right?  To
the ends always justify the means?  This is the question the worshipers
of the Church of Zimmerman must ask themselves.

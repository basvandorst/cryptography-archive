As a Canadian who has run into these problems, I am happy to answer your
question (though you are unlikely to be happy with my answer). We have
several legal departments who deal with this, be glad you have not had
to have out.

Yes, there are such CADADIAN laws. In fact, for all practical purposes,
you can assume that Canadian laws are identical to the U.S. laws, delayed
by a couple of months. This, I gather, is why the U.S. makes a general
exception for Canada. (One could easily assume that the U.S. laws are
automatically effective in Canada; but that would be counter to the image
of Canada as an independent country. Therefore, Canada go through the
excise of enacting the laws).

One can disagree with "them", but give them credit for having very
good brains.

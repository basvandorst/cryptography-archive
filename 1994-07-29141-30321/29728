Let's forget about the legalities for a second.
Is it *right* for someone else to be distributing an unauthorized, even if
(let us stipulate) highly improved version of PGP?  

Wouldn't the just and fair thing to be to call it, say, GPG, or GNP (GNP's Not
PGP), or some such?  And give it a new and unique set of version numbers?  And
include documentation making clear who did what?

It seems to me the coin of freedom has two sides... open speech on one and
privacy on the other.  This whole group is about aspects of privacy.  It would
indeed be ironic if, in it's pursuit, we gave up the flip side of the coin.

On a practical matter, the energy of groups often declines after
moderation.  I submit one of my favorite groups sci.aeronautics.airliners
as an example.  The threads are indeed free of trivialities and flames,
but the posts are much fewer and less vigorious.  And, at best, you
get only one dose a day of posts.

Let's not let tmp@netcom.com and sternlight@netcom.com drive us into
moderation.

If I took the message
  "WE WILL THROW A PIE IN CLINTON'S FACE AT 12:00"
and ran it through two independent encryption systems using anything other
than ECB mode, it might indeed come out of the second as
  "WE WILL THROW A PIE IN CLINTON'S FACE AT 12:00"
but that would be no more likely than its coming out as
  "WE WILL DONATE $1000 TO CLINTON'S DEFENSE FUND"
So, there is for all practical purpose, no risk of losing security in
this way.  (though one doesn't necessarily gain any either).

I'm new to the world of encryption, but am intensely interested in security.  
I've played around with a few algorithms and would like profesional criticism 
on them.
The main one:
Let's say: goofy  is the password.  Each of its characters' ASCII values are 
added into the variable: cksm.  If cksm>255 then cksm=cksm-256.  Keeping the 
value between 0 and 255.  Then cksm is added to each ASCII value of each 
character of 'goofy'.  This is looped 10 times.  Then the ASCII value of each 
character in 'goofy' (now something far from 'goofy') is XORed with the next 
ASCII value of the text to be encrypted.  If final output > 255 then -256.
Hope I haven't lost anyone yet, i'm not as learned as most in crypto-speak.  
I know it's not a very secure scheme 
but i'd like feedback on my idea.  XOR seems to be a useful encryption tool.
The pseudo-random seed given by the cksm loop seems to be random enough.
Any feedback on this?
Thanks

Matt

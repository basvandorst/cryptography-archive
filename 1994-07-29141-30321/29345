From Black's Law Dictionary:

*Conspiracy*.  A combination or confederacy between two or more persons
formed for the purpose of committing, by their joint efforts, some
unlawful or criminal act... Crime of conspiracy is distinct from the
crime contemplated by the conspiracy (target crime), Com. v. Dyer...

Careful, folks.  I don't particularly agree with the ITAR, but if you
insist on committing civil disobedience, you must be prepared to pay the
price.

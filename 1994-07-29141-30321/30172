As David and others have pointed out, we need to know the details of the
MIT-PKP license agreement.  If MIT granted an exclusive license covering
all commercial and non-commercial applications, then that explicitly means
that they cannot grant additional licenses to others even though they are
the patent holder.  I personally know of one case where a researcher was
granted a patent which was assigned to Stanford, since he was working there
at the time, and who later formed a company and tried to sell his
invention.  In the mean time, however, Stanford had granted an exclusive
license to another company, and that company got to tell the inventor that
he was in violation of his own patent, and they were able to force him to
cease production.

Secdrv13d is the latest version.  There was an unupdated .exe file in the 
package that had to be fixed.  From the readme file: 

If you found this file inside FPART13D.ZIP, this is an update
and bug fix for the FPART utility of SecureDrive Release 1.3d,
SECDR13D.ZIP.  If you found this file inside SECDR13D.ZIP, then
this indicates that the update to FPART has been incorporated.

The original FPART 1.3d was not updated to check for 1.3d-level
SECTSR loaded.

*************

On the general question of SFS vs SecureDrive, I couldn't get SFS to work 
with a doubledisked disk.  It kept confusing the Host Drive and the C: 
drive.  Really gave me a scare when I thought it had killed my C: drive.

If a system-id is hard to fake, it is also hard to keep constant on
a given system.

It sounds like you are saying here that installing the program in the
normal manner takes a huge amount of work.  This is not a plus for
selling your program.

Have you ever heard of a motherboard upgrade?  When a user upgrades
his system, the software breaks.  Great way to make software defective!

You should also be aware that the BIOS checksum is likely to be the same 
for the same model of computer purchased around the same time, so those 
big corporate or campus users can buy one copy and pass it around.

I have a better system for preventing piracy:  Alice doesn't
sell the software.  Alice puts the copies of the software
in a vault somewhere.  Even better, Alice destroys ALL the copies!

   I've got it!
 
   To solve a transposition cipher, this is what you do:
 
1.  Write a video game that involves descrambling letters into meaning-
    ful words.  Start with small sections of the block being transposed,
    and small words or word fragments.  As the difficulty increases,
    the blocks get larger.  Use tricks like I described in my last post to
    give the human player a hint.
 
2.  Set up the video games to receive transmissions of ciphertext that
    needs to be deciphered.  Use a variant of the Chinese Lottery scheme,
    as described in _Applied Cryptography_ to ensure the rightness of the
    results.
 
   The neat thing:  Something like this could be used for real-world ciphers,
too--starting with a partial solution of a stream cipher, use a human's
mind and pattern-matching skills along with a computer's brute-force
searching abilities to solve stream cipher output.  Again, it's the
Chinese Lottery approach that's used here, get to the final level, and
you win a big prize.  This is such a natural idea, I almost wonder whether
it's been done.  (_Ender's Game_ could be used as a precedent, sort-of.)

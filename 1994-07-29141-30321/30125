First of all I was wrong about McCandlish getting a Ph.D. It was Carl Kadie
of Comp Academic Freedom News. Deep apologies to Kadie for confusing him
with McCandlish.

We can see that this is not going to be a rational post from McCandlish, but
another juvenile attempt at name calling. We may expect that in what follows
he both distorts and avoids the issues. Let's see....>

The above avoids the issue and is simple self-justification.

No anti-EFF flamewar. When I think they are wrong on substance I say so.
When I think they are right on substance I have also said so. Note how
McCandlish tries (ham-handedly) to shift the discussion from the point at
issue to one of my motives, which he then misrepresents. So far pretty
juvenile.

Yes, well, that characterization comes from the Wall Street Journal, and was
not an inadvertence on their part. The Emperor's Clothes of EFF fool nobody.
Originally it was described as Mitch Kapor's personal toy. Later it became
an industry lobby. Check out their sources of funding by amount. That
usually tells the story more clearly than any claims.

Ah, the old, it's o.k. to put non-germane messages in a group if it's part
of cross-posting excuse.

Actually, I simply typed a reply. Since the posting was to a moderated group
as well as the unmoderated ones, it never got posted where I sent it, but
showed up at your moderation site. You must expect that if you have both
moderated and unmoderated groups on the Newsgroup list. Don't try to blame
the respondent for that artifact of either your chosen way to post, or of
normal newsreaders.

If you have been paying attention, which you seem to claim as an
"experienced" user, you would know that there have been many messages saying
political posts are unwelcome in sci.crypt. that talk.politics.crypto was
set up specifically for them, and that despite that some offenders who have
no respect for the wishes of their fellow man (including apparently you)
continue, so there's now a proposal to moderate the group.

Despite your attempts to pseudospeciate me, I am a reader of this group, I
don't value political posts in a technical newsgroup, and I have sent you
condemnatory mail about this. When I mentioned this to you in e-mail your
attempted refutation was to say I didn't count because I don't agree with
you or EFF on some matters and thus had a (giggle) (tee hee) "conflict of
interest".. Who else would you get condemnatory email from, those who agree
with you? Don't take readers here for fools. They are not.

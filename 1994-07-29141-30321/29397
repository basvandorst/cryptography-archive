I think the problem with these schemes of having multiple file systems 
on a single disk and being able to decrypt them with either real or duress
keys overlooks the possibility that you may not be present to do the 
key entry or decryption under duress.  
It seems to place extraneous control on the software or operating system 
which reads the drive.  It seems to me that the answer (to a secret police
force, experienced in cracking crypto, as well as skulls) would be to 
plug the drive into a separate controller, and analyze all of the data on it, 
to discover "hidden" file systems, etc.  If all of the "free space" on the 
disk was "cryptographically random" bytes, it would probably arouse a bit 
of suspicion.  I mean, when I look at the empty spce on my drive, it is 
a lot of pieces of old files, headers, stuff thats been deleted, etc. 
Defineitely not "white noise".  

If you knew that they were going to use your file system program to decrypt 
your files, your duress key could be a secret command to simply write 
garbage over your secret files, while displaying "decrypting, please wait..."
Or it could just crash the heads.   Hmm, a "self-crashing" hard drive, which 
not only crashed the heads, but dragged them all over the media, destroying
it, might be a good idea...  It would have to have enough on-board power 
backup to complete the job before the plug was pulled......

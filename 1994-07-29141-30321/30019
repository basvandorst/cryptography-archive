 It is absolutely clear that one of the fundamental strength issues
 in the BB&S RNG is "when is N sufficiently large that the system
 will be unpredictable?"  To answer this question, we *must* know
 the cycle structure of the system.  Simply saying "for N
 sufficiently large" (e.g., p. 369) may be fine theoretical math,
 but begs the question in practical application; it only says that
 "*some* N will be large enough."  This is hardly an answer.

 N = 23*47 is the main BB&S example.  I use it to avoid the charge of
 selecting a particular bad example.  It is a valid example of the
 cycle structure in a properly-constructed BB&S system.  It is only
 one example, but even one example can be a great deal more
 informative than "Does not!" "Does so!" arguments about proofs.

 Sure it does.  It is a valid experimental result.  The example does
 in fact prove that one system which is constructed only from "Blum"
 primes is substantially weaker than a far smaller system constructed
 from "special" primes.  Absent contrary examples or theoretical
 results, we must consider the possibility that this result does in
 fact represent the general situation.

 If "proven unpredictable" just means "hardly ever" instead of
 "never," we don't seem to get much from BB&S.  What we want is an
 absolute guarantee.  Then the massive computation needed for
 BB&S at least buys the guarantee.

 Since we *can* use the analysis in section 8 to avoid any short
 cycles, it is clear that we *can* make the absolute statement
 after all.  Sure enough (provided we believe QRA), BB&S really is
 "absolutely unpredictable."  But we only get to make the absolute
 statement *provided* we construct N with special primes and then
 validate X0 on a long cycle.

 If you can accept "hardly ever" when you can have "never," then
 you may not be able to see the distinction.  But the distinction
 exists, for the "hardly ever" X**2 mod N generator is just "almost
 always unpredictable" instead of simply "unpredictable."  Clearly,
 only the specially-constructed version conforms to the title of
 the paper.

 Yes.  The emphasis should be on the "guarantee" instead of any
 specific attack.


 At the risk of arguing scripture, I think it is clearly possible
 to interpret what "unpredictable" means in BB&S:

      1.  The note at the beginning of section 5 clearly states
          that issues of cycle length will be put off until
          section 8.

          In section 7, "unpredictable" is conditional on "some N
          which is large enough," but gives no guidance on what
          that N would be.  Without such guidance, "unpredictable"
          literally has no practical meaning.

      2.  The extensive development in section 8 is not just a
          way to *find* the cycle-lengths present in a X**2 mod N
          system built from arbitrary "Blum integers."  Instead, it
          is a way to *construct* a specialized form of X**2 mod N
          such that a particular cycle-length will exist.

          This is the only math in BB&S which addresses cycle
          lengths.  Only this math gives a practical meaning to the
          value of N which must be used.  Thus, for "unpredictable"
          to have a practical meaning, the special construction is
          necessary.


 Perhaps some of the confusion comes from two different "levels"
 of "proof" in the BB&S RNG.  The first level, the QRA, is not a
 proof, but instead a reasonable assumption.  The second level,
 the assumed cycle length, is a proof, but only for the special
 construction.

 The QRA assumption either is or is not true, but we think it is.
 The cycle length either is or is not long enough, but we only
 have math to tell us what N will make the cycle long enough when
 we use the special construction.

 Now, since the BB&S proof cannot, in a sense, be absolute, one
 can ask "why bother" spending the extra effort required for the
 special construction.  My answer is that this is a different
 level of the proof:  this particular weakness is guaranteed
 preventable.  We have no way to force the QRA to be valid if
 it is not.  We try to make the fewest assumptions possible.

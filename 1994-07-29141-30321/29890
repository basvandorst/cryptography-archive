   This point should NOT be lost.  The founders of this country felt
that violating unjust and immoral laws was a civic duty if there was
no alternative.  I'm not talking just about cases like the Boston Tea
Party, there are lots of other cases which were frequently cited
during the Constitutional Convention, including Shay's Rebellion,
William Penn's Hat, and Peter Zenger's trial.

   The famous Jefferson quote on this is "The Tree of Liberty must be
refreshed from time-to-time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.
It is its natural manure." (quoted from memory)  To violate laws, and
accept the risk, to life and liberty was something that the delegates
had individually and severally done.

   Sometimes civil disobedience will be judged wrong by history,
sometimes judged right, and in many cases never resolved, except by
the individuals involved.

   An individual who takes a public stand against government policy at
personal expense and risk, whether or not the government decides to
procecute, should not be considered self-serving.  It could only be
self-serving if done without risk and with expectation of profit.

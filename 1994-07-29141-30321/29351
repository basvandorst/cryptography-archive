I've been poking through the source code to MacPGP2.6 and have a
question.

Comments from "genprime.c"...
 
/*
 * This routine tests p for primality by applying Fermat's theorem:
 * For any x, if ((x**(p-1)) mod p) != 1, then p is not prime.
 * By trying a few values for x, we can determine if p is "probably" prime.
 *
 */

I had been lead to belive that Fermat Theorem could pass
"Charmihcle" (sp?) number which are not secure (not prime!).

I also had always been led to belive that there are other tests
which don't have this weakness (Knuth mentions at least one).

Question is, if these "better" tests are available, why not use them?

I understand that the composite numbers which "fool" Fermats theorem
are very rare, but if you have to do the work anyway, why not use
a stronger tool?

Is there a benefit to using Fermat over Rabin-Miller?  Is it lots faster?
Is there patent "problem".  Is it just not worth thinking about?

Thanks!

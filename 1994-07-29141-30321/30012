BWA-HA-HA-HAHA-HAHA!!   Oops, sorry, let me offer a more polite: Heh, heh,
heh.

As I'm sure many others will inform you, ANYONE who uses the Berkeley
anonymous remailer is posted as "Tommy the Tourist".

Tommy's "reputation" is scarred by erratic and inconsistent behavior...
behavior that is representative of the of dozens, perhaps hundreds, of users
who have used that remailer.

Tommy is sometimes kind and liberal, at other times crude and vulgar, and at
still other times conservative and moralistic.  Sometimes he waxes eloquent, 
and at other times he carries on like a crass numbskull.

Tommy's posts REQUIRE constant re-evaluation!! Yep, I'd even say that,
if Tommy has a reputation, it's one that's hindered by extremes of behavior
that could only be typical of a multiple personality disorder of gargantuan
proportions.

Not THAT hoary old chestnut again, Jim. It's not that it's not illegal until
it has been tested in the courts. It is that it IS illegal UNLESS it is
overthrown in the courts.

Let's knock off this stupid "not tested in the courts" argument. For all
practical purposes this is not only wrong in law but also wrong in practice,
unless you're very rich or have a public interest law firm behind you and
you don't mind losing.

To characterize the above as the assertion of "Friends of Big Brother" is
not only reprehensible but also false. It is the mainstream position.

Finally, I see that even you are having twinges of conscience, and are
trying to sneak this one in by te use of "tested _much_" (emphasis added).

are told by their pals that they are in the middle of the road. Nothing is
wrong any more (except, of course, conservative thoughts and expressions).

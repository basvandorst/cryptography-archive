 We expect a "real" cipher system to withstand years of technical
 attacks by massive banks of leading-edge supercomputers, attacks
 conservatively worth tens of millions of dollars.  This the type
 of strength we normally associate with real cryptography.

 How can we compare this to the relatively minor investment needed
 to insert a spoofed key into key-distribution, and get any
 appropriate person--even someone you trust--to falsely "certify"
 that key?

 I note that one side-effect of a system which depends on third-
 party certification is to place everyone who certifies keys at
 risk of being intimidated into certifying spoofed keys.

   Diskreet and DiskLock are _completely_ different programs. I don't know
the history behind Diskreet, but DiskLock was developed (and is owned) by
Sentient Software, in San Carlos, CA. DiskLock was published by Fifth
Generation Systems, which was then purchased by Symantec.

   If you have (sci.crypt type) questions about DiskLock, you should ask
the author, David Shayer. He can be reached at
"shayer@applelink.apple.com".

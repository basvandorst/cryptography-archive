Could somebody more competent than me on the legalities about patents
comment about this? Does a patent holder lose the patent if they don't
attempt to defend it against infringements?

I agree, this is quite ptobably how they have been reasoning. I just
wish that they have had reached this conclusion a bit faster. :-)

I don't think that the main goal of Phil has been to invalidate
software patents in general, although certainly his dislike of
software patents has been one of his driving motives. No, Phil's main
motive is and has always been to make strong crypto freely available
to the masses. And he has succeeded. :-)

I don't think so.

Yes, this question (does the goal justify the means) is something that
every honest person who is going to do something important should be
asking themselves. Regardless of whether it is somebody rioting
against a feodal tyrany (Robin Hood), someone conspiring to reject an 
opressing colonial regime (a bunch of guys writing the Declaration of
Independence), or someone who wishes to make strong crypto freely
available to the masses. They all have been breaking in some way the
established laws of their respective societies, fighting for something
better they have been believing in.

This discussion is getting pointless and certainly has nothing to do
with the science of cryptography, so I am redirecting the follow-us to
talk.politics.crypto.

|> I'll bet that there are no escrow ''features'' either

There are. Take a look at Matt Blaze's paper in the USENIX Summer 94
Technical Conference Proceedings, in which he describes an interesting
method of storing an escrow key on a smart card. The nice part is that
the person using the card doesn't see the key, and the card remembers
that it has been used so the owner can check.

Lots of people are motivated by $$$, including both you and me. That
doesn't mean anything one way or the other. Neither of us (nor I
imagine AT&T, particularly the people working in its research arm) are
lacking in other motivations as well.

I've tried parsing this sentence several times, but to no avail ...

CFS is not legally exportable from the US, that's why you couldn't get
it anonymously. I can't get it honestly either, which I detest, but
it's not Blaze's or AT&T's fault, it's the US Government's.

PGP is fine is you can put up with manually encrypting/decrypting your
files between sessions of using them in an application. CFS gets round
that.

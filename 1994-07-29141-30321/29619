It is arbitrary, but I would rate it as reasonable.

We all set our limits.  Some set it by time.  Some by interest.  Some
by the inferred quality of the people we talk to.  What is really being
argued about is the quality and type of criteria, given the technology
we have to decide who to respond to and who not.  One might, with some
degree of rationality, choose not to respond to someone with .fido in
their address.  And so forth.  We all have limited time and so choice
is eventually a necessity; and if we all sat down and thought up
our criteria, I'd bet there'd be arbitrariness of one kind or another
in most decision trees.  The only difference here is one individual
made one of his criteria public (and, perhaps, did so in a manner
that is flame bait or inferred so from his history).

To "really know" who you are talking to is, as you point out, at best
a lot of work and at worst impossible.  But, I think David is right this
time in that he's basically saying  "If you overtly tell me you don't
have the guts to respond in your own name, you aren't the kind of guy
I'll choose to argue with."  There is a certain accountability that comes
from using an identifiable name, especially if it _can_ be eventually
tracked down to an individual.  If a few individuals are bright enough
to rename themselves from Joe Blow to Joe Cool, I guess I'll be as 
fooled as anyone.  But, the issue at hand is those who use anon services
or otherwise make it obvious they've excised their identity.

I must confess that I, too, am less likely to respond to anonymous 
posts, especially in a sci.* group where there is very likely no good
reason for the anonymity.  In other groups, where there is more sense
to it, I'll probably respond.  But, the idea that we all don't have
response criteria, some of them quite arbitrary and ridicule-prone, 
is, I think, indefensible in the long run.

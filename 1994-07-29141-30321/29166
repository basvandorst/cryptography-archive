	But if the moderator lived outside the US, North American
readers couldn't mail him/her such postings anyway.  Having two
moderators (one in the US and one elsewhere) doesn't help, either.,

	I'm not sure if posting source code would fall under the
export regulations when the source is only the core algorithm that
requires some additional code to actually function.  For example, it
seems reasonable that you should be able to give the basic algorithm
for (say) RSA encryption/decryption, and add a paragraph that says "Of
course, you'll need a subroutine library for arbitrary-precision
interger math; writing such a library is left as an exercise for the
reader."  One of the arguments used against the export of the _Applied
Cryptography_ diskette was that the code is ready to be compiled or
incorporated into other software.

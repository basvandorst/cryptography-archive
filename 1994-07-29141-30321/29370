Ciphertext can be "uncompressed" to impose desired statistical properties.
A non-adaptive first-order arithmetic decompression will generate first-order 
symbol frequencies that emulate, for instance, English text.   (But digram and 
higher order statistics will be uniformly random).  Higher order schemes might 
pass some simple tests for English texts.  

The term steganography describes the hiding of a message.  What 
term describes hiding the fact that a message is encrypted?

In step two above, the better the compression scheme, the better the 
resemblance will be between uncompressed gibberish (or ciphertext) and 
legitimate data.

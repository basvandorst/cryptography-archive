However sincere or insincere those concerns were, they were ill-framed. You
cannot exclude an entire nation's citizens from moderatorhood, particularly
the U.S. with its contributions to crypto, just because you might want, on
rare occasion, to post code in a forum. This is especially true when there
are other alternatives. Note also that the original poster expressed the
exclusion of Americans as moderators dogmatically, not as a question for
discussion. Thus I took the remark as being made with ill grace.

Nevertheless, it is my policy to give an apology whenever one is requested,
regardless of the merits of the case. It costs me nothing and might increase
another's happiness. Thus if the original poster requests an apology he will
receive it instantly.

The values that define our common-sense world are under assault. Some have
taken to extremes the spurious notion of freedom without responsibility, and
are trying to tear down moral guardrails. Those who live on the shoulders
are told by their pals that they are in the middle of the road. Nothing is
wrong any more (except, of course, conservative thoughts and expressions).

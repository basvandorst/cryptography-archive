(This is off the topic of what follows, but I am reading the book even though I
don't speak C.  Once or twice this is very jarring, notably section 9.3.
In particular a verbal tour of Euclid's algorithm, which doesn't seem to 
have been part of my high school calculus class, would have been very helpful.)
 
BEWARE: I'm quoting some stuff that I think is VERY WRONG in the next two
paragraphs.

The day that our goverment or our courts rule that the **choice of typeface**
affects the extent to which the First Amendment applies to a **book** is
the day that I stop trying to teach Constitutional Law in a balanced or
reasonable way and start screaming a lot.

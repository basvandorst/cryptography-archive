In article <30h1m8$bt0@senator-bedfellow.MIT.EDU>, solman@athena.mit.edu (Jason W Solinsky) wrote much about double encryption etc.

I have remarkably little knowledge of the maths behind crypto, and it
doesn't help that I rather flunked first year number theory but:

Any system is more likely to have bugs the more complicated it gets.

The *mainstream* algorithms such as DES, IDEA, etc. have been extensively
analysed, considered, tested and used. This doesn't in any way prove that
there isn't a *short cut* algorithm to cracking them, but a lot of people
are looking and if one exists, it will get found one day.

You may believe that using two passes of IDEA, three of DES, and several
translations makes for improved security. This *may* be true. Alternatively,
you may have created a hole, either through the algorithms or their
implementation that makes the system *more* vulnerable.

Because the *improved* system is a minority interest, and not the subject of
research, testing and use, it is unlikely that the hole will be found rapidly.
That isn't to say that there isn't one, and a determined and wealthy
opponent is likely to be the first to find out and keep the fact to
themselves.

The problem I have is not the distinction between patents and trademarks or
copyrights.  The problem I have is the apparent attitude of a person who
believes that a bank accumulating money is wrong (so he relieves them of
it without benefit of legal process) and then turns around and complains
when someone tresspasses on his property.

Perhaps that person has a deep philosophy which resolves the ignoring
the law on one hand (PKP patent rights) while claiming the law on the other
(personal rights to trademark), but by Occams' Razor, it just looks like
a common philosophy of "me first".

Implementations which may comply with this standard include
electronic devices (e.g., VLSI chip packages), micro-processors
using Read Only Memory (ROM), Programmable Read Only Memory
(PROM), or Electronically Erasable Read Only Memory (EEROM), and
mainframe computers using Random Access Memory (RAM).  >)When

complying with the standard.  Note that FIPS 140-1 places
additional requirements on cryptographic modules for
Government use.

FIPS PUB 140-1, 11 Jan 94:

    SECURITY LEVEL 1

     For Security Level 1, the following requirements apply.  Note
     that as a consequence of these requirements, multi-user,
     multi-processing operating systems are explicitly excluded from
     Security Level 1, and hence, must satisfy the requirements for
     Security Levels 2, 3 or 4.

   * All cryptographic software shall be installed only as
     executable code in order to discourage scrutiny and
     modification by users.

     SECURITY LEVEL 2
     ...
   * All cryptographic software, cryptographic keys and other
     critical security parameters, and control and status
     information shall be under the control of an operating
     system that provides controlled access protection (i.e., C2
     protection in accordance with the Trusted Computer System
     Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC), or FIPS approved equivalent).
     ...

Note that PCs and MACs, etc. used single user are permissible, everything 
else has to be a trusted computer system.

Its FIPS PUB 140-1 that gives permission for software cryptography.  It
covers DES implemenations acquired by the government:

    10.   Implementations.  This standard covers implementations of
    cryptographic modules including, but not limited to, hardware
    components or modules, software programs or modules, computer
    firmware, or any combination thereof.  ...

    11.   FIPS Approved Security Methods.  Cryptographic modules that
    comply with this standard shall employ cryptographic algorithms,
    cryptographic key generation algorithms and key distribution
    techniques, and authentication techniques that have been FIPS
    approved for protecting Federal Government unclassified
    information.  FIPS approved cryptographic algorithms,
    cryptographic key generation algorithms and key distribution
    techniques, and authentication techniques include those that are
     either:

      a.    specified in a Federal Information Processing
            Standard (FIPS), or
    ...
    If a cryptographic module is required to incorporate a trusted
    operating system, then the module shall employ trusted operating
    systems that have been evaluated by a NIST accredited evaluation
    authority and against a FIPS approved evaluation criteria.

Software implementations of the algorithm are compliant when validated.  The
entire computer system becomes a 'cryptographic module' and must be type
certified (not individually). 

(The government is already using DES software on PCs for info covered by
the Privacy Act.)

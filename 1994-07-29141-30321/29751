Another atack that is possible is this.

If someone is foolish enough to use a image pulled off the net, the image 
could be compared to stored copies and the difference in the pictures 
used.  Also, this could be extended to any known work of art, published 
picture, or widely disemenated photo.  About the best use of this would 
be a scan of self created art that was distroyed after.

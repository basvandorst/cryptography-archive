Maybe, even probably.  But maybe not :)  Those who might know otherwise
monitor but don't post to this group.  

I think you can safely assume your tax dollars have been spent in large
quantity to examine DES.  Someday we will know just how easily DES is
being read... 

Anyway, to your question.  Even compressed data doesn't look like random
bits.  Once you get to non-random looking bits, you could look further.

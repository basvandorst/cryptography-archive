The short answer is that the Department of State, Office of Defense Trade 
Controls (DOS/DTC) and the National Security Administration (NSA) won't 
allow unrestricted export (like is being done with WinCrypt) for any 
encryption program that the NSA can't crack with less than a certain 
amount (that they are loathe to reveal) of effort.  For the long answer, 
see ftp://ftp.csn.net/cryptusa.txt.gz and/or call DOS/DTC at 703-875-7041.

Yes.  Even amateur cryptanalysts can crack it in most cases.  People who 
don't know much about cryptography or cryptanalysis (the majority of all 
people in the world) probably couldn't.

On the other hand, WinCrypt is pretty good IF you keep your encrypted 
text to less than the length of your password, AND IF you generate your 
password randomly, AND IF you only use each password ONCE.  :-)

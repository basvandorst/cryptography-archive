I wouldn't say "easily" -- it took me a couple of hours to find enough
cribs to put together into enough text to get coherent phrases, and it
would have been a few hours more if I hadn't recognized the text.  Not as
easy as Vigenere or Enigma :-) where it's possible to write a program to
do a long enough sample automatically.  It may be possible to write a
running key program with no human intervention, but I for one haven't
tried it.  Perhaps a dictionary-based attack, crib-dragging all the
longish words in the known world and recognizing results by common
trigraphs or (if we see word divisions) dictionary lookup.  Hurm.

Other kinds of book ciphers are stronger, like the one posted by Alec
Chambers (WW II Cipher) a couple of months ago, or a seriously homophonic
type like the second Beale cipher.

Regarding the earlier filament (a very small thread...) concerning the
legality of crypto technologies outside of the U.S.  The situation is
complex and varies widely from country to country.

I believe that it's illegal in some countries to encrypt data that is
transmitted across national borders.  And I _KNOW_ that France has
extremely strict regulation of crypto.  You have to have a government
license to use encryption (even on a LAN), and you must retain your
keys for something like six months.  (This is really painful for
something like the Kerberos system used in DCE where there are
per-session unique keys generated randomly.)

Certainly as bad as the record of the U.S. Government is in respecting
privacy of citizen's communications (...read the Puzzle Palace...),
you can be certain that Europe has far fewer restrictions on
government eavesdroppers -- they just haven't had the computer
technology to do it very efficiently (until now...).

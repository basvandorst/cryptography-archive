s-tools can encrypt the data -- and the length field that is used to
indicate the probable presence of a file -- before hiding it in the
sound/picture. That means that without the passphrase you are helpless
(see below)

Quite simple. Encrypted data looks truly random. Truly random data
does not occur in natural sources such as sound and pictures. s-tools
takes steps to avoid this by using a cryptographically strong random
number generator to choose the positions of the bits that it will use
to hide the information. This means that each LSB in the sound/picture
has a probability of being changed, not a certainty. Whilst this is by
no means perfect, it does go some way to solving the problem.

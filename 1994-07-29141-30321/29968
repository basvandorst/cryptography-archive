	I have been trying to compile the IDEA source code from Bruce 
Schneier's book, _Applied Cryptography_ but I have ran into a problem.
The idea.h file has a line which says:
#include "usuals.h" /* typedefs for byte, word16, boolean,etc. */

I can not find the usuals.h file in the source code examples in the book, 
and it does not come with GCC or my compiler, Power C. (It is a user 
include file)  

I have never had to define variable types, and I am unsure how to do this.
If anyone has the actual usuals.h file, or knows how I should make my 
own, please reply.
Thanks
     Jay

One way to avoid encryption detection is by a variation of the old microdot
routine.

1.   Digitize some old, grainy photo
2.   Replace bit k*n of the photo with bit k of the encoded message; where n
is some constant ~ 60.

With even a modest computer, no need to securely transmit the constant n.  The
recipient just tries them all.

Clearly, this method does not conserve bandwith.

Our photo eMicrodot (tm) can be compressed anbd viewed as a regular photo.
For a special treat for the boys from Justice, use a picture of J. Edgar in 
drag.

Any comments?

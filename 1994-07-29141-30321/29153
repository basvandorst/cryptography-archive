The program takes a file and encrypts it with IDEA using a MD5 hash of the password typed in by the user.  It then stores the file in the lowest bit (or bits, user selectable) of a sound file.  I can not here any real difference in the sound afterwards, and it makes it hard for people to tell if you have encrypted data on your machine.

A 32 bit color 640x480 pictures is about a meg.  Most sounds are smaller.  Also, it tells you if the picture has data in it when you open it.  My program can't tell if there is data in the sound unless the password is right.

[Try using a CR when you type]

Stools also does this (don't know if Stego and this are the same), but
you can select an option which does NOT indictae if there is encrypted data
in the file. So you might wnat to get ahold of this program.

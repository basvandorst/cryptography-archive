A newsgroup is not the place for code fragments. Any attempt to use it for
that purpose as a provocation should be moderated out, no matter what
country the moderator is from. I have seen numerous complaints against the
practice of posting code fragments in newsgroups, in several newsgroups,
having nothing to do with export laws.

Code fragments belong in files with pointers to them, particularly fragments
long enough and specific enough to come under the provisions of the ITAR.
The legal responsibility for such ftp-able files belongs with the uploader.

The values that define our common-sense world are under assault. Some have
taken to extremes the spurious notion of freedom without responsibility, and
are trying to tear down moral guardrails. Those who live on the shoulders
are told by their pals that they are in the middle of the road. Nothing is
wrong any more (except, of course, conservative thoughts and expressions).

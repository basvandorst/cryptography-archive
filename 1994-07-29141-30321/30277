I believe this was the basis for investigating Zimmerman.  
Plus, the government routinely investigates / prosecutes
people for illegal things they do on the net such as computer breakin, 
software theft, and child pornography.

I can not for the life of me imagine why you would think they
would not prosecute somebody illegally exporting cryptos
through the net.  They wouldn't even think twice about it.

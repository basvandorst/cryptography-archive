That's fine. I recently ran into a similar problem on cypherpunks when we were
discussing a paper by Chaum in which he demonstrates that it must be
computationally possible to identify transferable e-cash when you see it
twice, but not necessarilly computationally feasible. I find it amusing the
distinction that many cryptographic papers make between the possible and
the computationally possible given that the entire field of cryptography
(as it exists today) is dependent on computational infeasibility, not
impossibility.

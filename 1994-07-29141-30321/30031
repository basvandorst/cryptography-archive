This file is present in the source distribution of PGP. Unfortunately,
the sources are not on the computer I am posting from, so it is not easy 
for me to post the file (about 50 lines) here - maybe somebody else could
do it. In particular,

typedef unsigned char byte;
typedef unsigned short word16;
typedef unsigned char boolean;

Do you need some other typedefs?

Regards,
Vesselin

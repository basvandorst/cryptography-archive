You could do it like this:

Each decoder box contains a serial number (also printed on the outside
of the box, and you give this to the service provider when you
subscribe to the service) and a secret key which is embedded in
the box and is protected by tamper-proof circuitry.  The key is
unique for each box.

A smart card is made for a specific box serial number by the service
provider who knows the {serial number, secret box key} pair.  It contains 
channel keys to decrypt the broadcasts encrypted with the box-specific key.  
The smart card may insist on a challenge-response sequence to be sure
it's talking to the correct box.  The box loads the channel keys from the 
card and decrypts them with the box-specific key.  These keys are held 
in tamper-proof memory, since if you can read these out and transplant 
them into another box, it will be able to receive the broadcasts also 
(until the keys are changed, which might be monthly.)  You might make 
the memory volatile, but it's a nuisance for the user to re-insert the 
card(s) every power failure.

There may be separate keys for separate channels, to permit selective
activation of each channel.  You could conceivably have different cards 
from different providers, each giving keys for a subset of the possible 
channels.

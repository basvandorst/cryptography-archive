Bruce Schneier's "Applied Cryptography" has a good treatment of this 
subject.  Basically, a stream cipher just generates an unpredictable 
(without the key) stream of bits or bytes, that are then xor'ed with the 
plain text to encrypt it.  To decrypt, just generate the same stream with 
the same key and xor again.

My favorite stream ciphers are the ones that use a strong block cipher.  
For example, start a counter at a point determined by your initialization 
vector, then encrypt the counter's output.  Another way is to repeatedly 
feed the output of the block cipher back to its input.

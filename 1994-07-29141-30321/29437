A copy of Applied Cryptography for $25 is indeeda good deal; I can't even
buy copies from the publisher at that price.

The copyright date in the book is 1994; the book was published in Nov 1993.
It is the first (and so far, only) edition.

I try to keep the errata up to date, and post it here regularly.  Or you
can send me e-mail for a copy.  (Hopefully the sci.crypt faq says this.)

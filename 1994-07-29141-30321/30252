I have been pointing this out for a while.  No response, either from
the Powers that Be (I got a "thank you for your input" from NIST) or
from the people who are saying "clipper is better than nothing because
only the Good Guys can tap it".

The Man in the Middle vulnerability is a part of *any* system that does
all of its cryptographic verification over the same wire.  The
cryptographic algorithms themselves don't really matter.  This is the
reason for the "key distribution hierarchy" for PEM or the "web of
trust" for PGP.  Makes it more difficult for someone else to claim to be
you.

I'm not *quite* to the point of bidding a fixed-price contract to build
a clipper MitM board .... (:-)

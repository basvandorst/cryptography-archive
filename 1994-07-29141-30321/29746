DES is no problem.  In fact, according to Schneier (Applied Cryptography,
p 231) an i486 at 33 MHz can encrypt 40,600 DES blocks/second.  Multiply
by 64 bits/block and you are already over 1.5 Mbps.  Hardware is faster.

For RSA:
From the same book (p.285) current chips are in the 10 to 50 Kbps range.
There are also chips being worked on that are supposed to approach 1 Mbps.

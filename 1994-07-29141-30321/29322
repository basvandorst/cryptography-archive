Don't forget to use latex gloves designed for use in Class-100 or smaller
clean room environments: they don't have talc or other microcrystalline
lubricants like the medical versions have.

Also, not wetting anything with your saliva (which of course can be mined
for DNA samples) is a very good idea.

(The above not to be construed as advocating anything illegal of course.)

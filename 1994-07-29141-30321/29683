The problem with your solution is that it does not do exactly what
Justin wished to do.  Justin's proposal would allow one to send the
*same* encrypted message to all those in the group. Your solution requires
seperately encrypting the message for each recipient.

Your comments about the public and private keys not having any inherent
differences is a good one. There is not need to distribute the private key
and keep the public one confidential. The normal use of the key pairs would
work fine. The scheme, as you say, becomes essentially conventional encryption
since it is required to limit the knowledge of the public keys to those you
desire to be able to read the messages.

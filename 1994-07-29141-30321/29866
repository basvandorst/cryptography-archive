 I have certainly been discussing this for the five years or so
 that I have been on sci.crypt.  This topic pops up about once a
 year, we have a short tussle, and then it goes away.

 There is a fundamental difference between a probabilistic security
 argument:

      "Sure, a short cycle would be insecure, but that hardly ever
      happens."

 and the mathematical proof of an absolute statement like BB&S:

      "We are guaranteed to not use a short cycle."

 Now, if someone were to come forward with a cycle-length analysis
 which, for example, showed a construction to make short cycles
 provably rare, then we would have another interesting scheme.  But
 it would not carry the absolute proof statement of BB&S.  And
 because of that, it would certainly be inappropriate to imply that
 the new construction was, essentially, BB&S.  BB&S is an absolute
 statement (provided the proofs stand, of course).

 One of our local cellular carriers has started advertising digital
service with full page ads in the New York Times claiming that they
will keep your conversations "secret".  What, if any, are the
technical bases for these claims?  ( My guess is that it is simply a
case of (temporary) security through obscurity because digital
compatible scanners are not readily available to the public (yet). )

BTW - an earlier append claimed that there is a consumer grade
cordless phone with voice encryption that changes "keys" everytime the
handset is returned to base.  I think that there is NO encryption of
voice on such phones.  There is a changing access code to make it
harder for someone to "steal" phone service by dialing out on your
base with a compatible handset...

   I'm confused. Of what practical value is this as a threat? That you can send
   a gibberish message that is the product of two real messages, and add a
   valid signature to it seems, at most, a minor nuisance--that is, it would
   mean people would receive a gibberish message that was signed.

   The likelihood that somehow you could get or trick someone into producing
   two signed messages whose product made for anything damaging, if signed,
   seems to me to be miniscule.

   Or is there something I don't understand?

If a person is reading a garbaged message, the reception of correctly
signed gibberish might be a minor nuisance.  However, the effect of
even minor nuisances could be useful to an attacker -- by prompting
the correspondents to waste time checking out their communications
systems, for example. Observing *how* they check out their systems
might be even more useful.

However, if a program without adequate error checking receives a
nonsense message, the consequences could be very serious.  If the
class of messages are short integer values to be inserted in a
database, and I stood a reasonable chance of updating your personal
data with garbage, I suspect you would not like the result.

Further, note that you don't have to trick anyone.  Snooping is quite
adequate to provide me with a pair of (M, C) pairs.  I concede that if
I can snoop the M's, I might be able to snoop the secret key as well,
in which case you are in deep do-dos.  If I assume that my snooping
looks only at your M held on disk or backup tape and at C as it passes
over the wire, I can avoid seeing your key.  Alternatively, I might be
able to monitor your general-purpose computer and all its
communications, including those to and from your smart-card which
performs the encryption and signing, without being able to monitor the
internal workings of the card itself.

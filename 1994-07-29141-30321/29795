   Yes, they are unrelated.  Infringing someone's valid patent (conceding
for the moment that Zimmerman did this) is different from marketing a
product as ostensibly by one person when it isn't.  
If you want to complain about PGP in the first place, that's got nothing
to do with the impropriety of what the other guy did.

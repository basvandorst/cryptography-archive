[remainder of message suggesting CACM will sort it out, omittted].

Good points all. In fact, having posted my opinions (and they are just that,
not "the truth" on this matter), I have no intention of continuing this
discussion. Any flame war will be one-sided, and based on others attacking
me because they don't like my opinions. I don't plan to respond since each
of us is entitled to his opinions, and any personal attacks on another will
simply discredit the attackers. As to posters who simply express differing
opinions of their own without attacking me for mine, that is unexceptionably
their right.

The values that define our common-sense world are under assault. Some have
taken to extremes the spurious notion of freedom without responsibility, and
are trying to tear down moral guardrails. Those who live on the shoulders
are told by their pals that they are in the middle of the road. Nothing is
wrong any more (except, of course, conservative thoughts and expressions).

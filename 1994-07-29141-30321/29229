Post some input and output of the file on the net so everyone have chance to
go over it.

Suggestion: Put the input on one file, put the out put in another file, tar
them into one file compress them, and finally encode them and put it to the
net.  Or make table in one file and list the input and out put as follows:

Input       Output
--------    -------
E4 B1 A2     C1
C3 B1 78     8A
and so on...

              With highest regrads,

 Well, within a computation machine, everything is necessarily
 "systematic" in some sense.  However, to the extent that a keying
 value must be "unpredictable" to improve the strength of the system,
 this would seem to imply cryptographic analysis.  "Unpredictability"
 is virtually the essence of cryptography.  A system which attempts
 to achieve unpredictability in key-generation to improve on the
 fundamental strength of the "primitive" is more cryptography than
 key-management.

 I am casually familiar with the reference, and have it in front
 of me as I write.  The closest thing I see is on p. 295 which
 shows a real-time-driven RNG which is then enciphered to produce
 session keys.  Normally, I would expect a "session" to imply a
 substantial amount of data, or whatever is available to send as
 a unit at that time.

 When we start talking about using almost as much key as data, we
 are really talking more about innovating a new product cipher than
 key-management.  I see no reason to believe that the diagram was
 constructed in that context.

 If we are to trust any such new product cipher as well as we would
 trust the "primitive," it must have a similarly open design and
 as rigorous a public analysis as the primitive.

	There are several MSDOS ports of the crypt() function floating 
around.  One of the fastest and most portable that I've used is fcrypt() 
included in a package of general DES utilities distributed by (and 
written by I assume) Eric Young.  
	The package I got was from 
ripem.msu.edu but you first have to send them e-mail stating your 
citizenship (US or Canada), willingness to comply to federal crypto 
export laws, willingness to comply with software license terms, snd a 
host name that is obviuosly within the US or Canada.
	For more info, ftp as anonymous and get the file : GETTING_ACCESS.

Tom Rollins is right, in that he is entirely free to do what he likes
to the PGP source code and release the result to all and sundry.

Phil Zimmermann is also right, in that mutant versions should not be
released with the same names as other versions.  That was exactly why
I released my version as PGP 2.6ui, not PGP 2.6; and that was exactly
why I got annoyed when someone modified it and released the modified
version as 2.6ui.

I wouldn't have made 2.6ui claim to be 2.6 on armoured files, were it
not for the fact that D*v*d St*rnl*ght was harassing people whose
ASCII armoured files reported anything other than "2.6".

The Applied Cryptography source code disk covering just the code already
printed in the book has been the subject of my Commodity Jurisdiction
Request to the State Dept (CJ Case 081-94). The original ruling came back
that this was a controlled munition, despite an earlier case (CJ 038-94)
ruling that the book itself is in the public domain.

I filed an administrative appeal, and the lawyers who have been
informally handling the case for me pro bono have said that a decision
is expected this week. Stay tuned; I intend to widely publicize
whatever response I get.

See the narrative in http://www.cygnus.com/~gnu/export.html for
background details, including my filings and State responses.

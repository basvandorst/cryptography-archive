Nah.

If the binaries are *identical*, this holds. A 'lossy' format
conversion, such as GIF->JPEG will remove the trace. For example,
I could take a picture, crop it marginally, alter it's aspect ratio by 3%,
airbrush out the bulletin board number, etc, store it as a JPG and then turn 
it back into a GIF. The resulting binaries will be near identical to the 
viewer but will be entirely different in content.

The same applies to the same physical picture scanned different times,
only more so.

I thought of posting examples, but it's a waste of bandwidth.

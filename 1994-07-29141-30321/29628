Not reliable at all. I have a program that can forge PKZIP version 1.1
-AV codes in less than a minute on a XT. It doesn't work on PKZIP
version 2.04g archives, but I have seen such archives with forged -AV
codes, so it should be possible. And no, don't ask, I am not
distributing this program.

Actually, it is much worse. The encryption is weak, but I have not
seen any easy ways to crack it - all known zip crackers use either
brute force or dictionary attacks. However, the validation is
*extremely* easy to break. Judge by yourself - check the -AV codes of
the followin archive, using PKZIP 1.1 (*not* 2.04g!):

[post omitted].

It is good to have this clarification. However, it does not address the
appropriateness of the name "USACM" in a headline, which was misunderstood
by me and several others to mean the U.S. ACM organization, not some
special-purpose subcommittee speaking only for itself (since ACM does not
take political positions).

What is more the press release seems to suggest a monolithic anti-Clipper
position. I am advised that at least two members of the ACM committee on
Clipper not only don't hold that view but hold an opposite one. Thus the
press release misleads in that respect as well. Dorothy Denning is one
member of the ACM committee that examined Clipper, I am advised. Thus the
press release seems to me to be more like a distorted propaganda exercise by
the anti-Clipper forces than a fair representation.

It is both good and highly praiseworthy that ACM takes itself so seriously
that its President responded to this issue. It would be good if he seized
himself of the above points as well.

wrong any more (except, of course, conservative thoughts and expressions).

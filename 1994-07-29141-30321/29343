Encrypted data could be hidden within a "legitimate" file format;
for example, a loseless image or sound format.  This would foil
cursory examinations (or level 0 triggers as we would say in physics)
because such supposedly legitimate, non-critical data might
immediately be discarded by Big Brother.

Of course, any tool which analyzed the particular file format
would detect that this isn't a normal data set.  For example,
if someone ran statistics on the variation of pixel intensity
in an image, they would see that it was random and would flag
it for further examination.

I suppose you could stuff such a data set with redundancies and
false details which would foil the compression test and _some_
other data statistics tests.

(This is probably the type of idea every new guy brings up on
this newsgroup.  Glad to meet yall :-)

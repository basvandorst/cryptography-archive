Do you really use it - after all your critics? :-)

The result on cycle lengths doesn't say much how large N must be to make  
the output stream of BBS unpredictable for practical purposes; at most it  
gives a weak lower bound. More useful hints on the size of N are given by  
the results on factoring large numbers.

And, unfortunately, BB&S's result is on the cycle length of the sequence  
of quadratic residues x_i that is only kept as internal state of the  
generator. The result doesn't say anything about the cycle length of the  
output bitsream (except, of course, giving an upper bound). (See `open  
question' in BB&S's paper.)

Help. I have quite a problem. I haven't used Ca-Simply Money in a while,
and I can't remember the password to my files (all my financial data).
The manual describes casm's encryption as 'will not stop the determined',
so I guess its not very secure. Does anyone know of a program that will
either remove the password from my data files, alter it or display it?

Thank you for any help you can offer.

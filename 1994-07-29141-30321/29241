This is the README file that accompanies the disks:


Greetings:

These two disks are the source code disks that accompany Applied
Cryptography.  The source code here has been collected from a
variety of sources.  Some code will not run on some machines. 
Use them as you see fit, but be aware of any copyright notices on
the individual files.

See ERRATA.TXT for corrections to the book.  (ERRATA.WP is a
WordPerfect version of the same file.)

These disks will be updated semi-annually, both with new
algorithms and new cryptographic results.  For a copy of the next
disk set, send $30 to the above address (or $90 for a two-year
subscription).

Every file has been compressed.  To uncompress, run:

     UNZIP filename

There is an unzipper on each source code disk.

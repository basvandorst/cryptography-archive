Yes, you can, if you can assume that your copy of PGP has not been
fiddled with.  OF course, it's just as easy to install a fiddled
PGP as to fiddle with your key ring, so I don't think that's a
really good assumption.  PGP assumes that your key ring is protected
from modification in the same wasy as your copy of PGP is.

Well, the stuff protected under a passphrase is safe as long as the
passphrse is secure; all an attacker can do is garble it, which
is not substantially worse than deleting it.  Yes, the passphrase
is safe.

I'd worry about someone tampering with the PGP executable a great deal more.
If you can fiddle with that, the game is over; your security is blown.

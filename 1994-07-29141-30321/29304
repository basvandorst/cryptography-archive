David:
	I consider one major flaw in your arguements about the name/abbreviation
of the USACM.  It is the name and abbreviation _selected_by_ the people in 
charge of the ACM.  While you may have once been a member of the ACM, your
objections mean the same as any other opinion, member or no.  If you wish to
make your complaints know effectively, I suggest you re-join that organization.
If not, gripe all you want, but expect to be ignored as any other nonmember
would be...

	Some possibilities:
	1. You're using an old compiler on the SPARC.  This can be quite
	important, since code optimization can double (or better) RISC
	machine's performance.
	2. You're using a new compiler on the Sun 3/50 that produces better
	code, and hence better performance than the docs.
	3. Modern workstations often burn large portions of their speed
	improvements on their interface.  I don't know if this affects them
	when nothing of interest is happening on the screen, but you may
	not get the 6:1 to 12:1 improvement over the Sun 3/50
	you might expect.
	4. Your Sun 3/50 may have been upgraded to use a 68030 or 68040.
	A fast 68030 can keep up with the earlier SPARCs.
	5. If ufc.crypt uses large blocks of memory, you're going to be
	limited by memory bandwidth, not processor speed.

	Hope this helps,

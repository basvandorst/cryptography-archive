According to Jim Bidzos, the President of RSADSI/PKP, the above is false.
Any use of RSA requires a license. I explicitly asked permission for

You have your opinion, he has his. You are not an attorney, he is. He is a

The values that define our common-sense world are under assault. Some have
taken to extremes the spurious notion of freedom without responsibility, and
are trying to tear down moral guardrails. Those who live on the shoulders
are told by their pals that they are in the middle of the road. Nothing is
wrong any more (except, of course, conservative thoughts and expressions).

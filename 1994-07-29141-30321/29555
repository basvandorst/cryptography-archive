Excepting rubber-hose cryptanalysis, there are techniques that are
strong enough that modern governments can't crack after the fact from
cyphertext alone; the price of cracking may include bugging the sender's
or receiver's computers or rooms, etc., which has to be done beforehand.

On the other hand, with a few exceptions (assasinations or major bombings),
there are few one-time activities that can *really* upset a government;
the major threats to their power are long-term on-going processes,
and those usually give them plenty of time to watch the participants,
follow the money around, bribe informants, plant inside agents, etc.

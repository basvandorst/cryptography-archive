   Haven't seen any replies to this, so...

   I agree with some of your findings.  This does appear to be a substitution
and a transposition.  However, although the last line is indeed 26 different
characters, (1) it seems to end with one of the null characters and (2) it's
definitely not in alphabetical order.

   Frequency counts indicate there's a good chance this is English, or at least
some Romance language; the top 5 characters take up 46.77% of the text, the
top 9 69.48%, and the lowest 5 3.50% (a little high but that's not important).
A quick and incomplete digram count shows (me) that there are entirely too many
digrams which appear frequently both forward and reversed, which suggests the
transposition.  Triples such as NNN, WWW, GGG, VVV and RRR reinforce that;
though they could be digits or markings, there are only 6 in the text.

   But you knew that.  :-)

   You mention the factorization 3 * 13, but if you remove the null characters
and ignore the alphabet line for now, it could also be a 47 x 39 tableau.  The
alphabet line may be indicative of the transposition order, or a checkerboard,
or nonsense to mislead.

   How to attack?  This is where I fall down.  All I can suggest is to do the
substitution by frequency count, then play with transpositions to try to find
likely fragments of plaintext, correcting the substitution as you go.

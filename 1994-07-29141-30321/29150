:> A few days ago, I finally decided to write a (macintosh) program that I had been meaning to do for a long time.  The program takes a file and encrypts it with IDEA using a MD5 hash of the password typed in by the user.  It then stores the file in the lowest bit (or bits, user selectable) of a sound file. ...

:> I have a few questions:
:>  
:> 2.  How hard is it to tell if the lowest bits of a sound are just sound, or are really encrypted data?

:Of course it depends on what sort of sound it is but, in general, I think
:it's very hard indeed.

I think a sound file with a random last bit might sound better than
one with a sampled last bit.
Why not put two sound files up for ftp and challenge us to decide
which contains the hidden data?
It would make for a refreshing change from the ciphertext only challenges.

:> 3.  Does anyone care for a copy?

:Yes please, if it's legal to export it.

Not for me, I don't want to use a computer from Apple.

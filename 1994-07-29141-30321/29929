Obviously even the patent holders have not found it convincing enough,
because they didn't sue him. And, as far as I recall, unless somebody
is convicted of a crime, he is innocent. Grady, what are you trying to
do with your mindless attacks? Smear Phil's reputation? You only make
yourself look ridiculous. Please, be rasonable.

You owe him an appology because you are trying to damage his
reputation in a public forum, and are doing this without having any
reasonable arguments, and are using Sternlight's arguing tactics. Gee,
just the latter is enough to say "shame on you". (I know that I am
doing it myself when arguing with him, but this is mostly to make fun
out of him.) C'mon, Grady, I had a better oppinion about you!

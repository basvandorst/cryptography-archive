It was not my intent to defend the choice of DES over other Feistel
ciphers or other modern ciphers.  Of course, I prefer DES to FEAL-8 or to
DES-8.  For some applications, and all other things equal, I prefer IDEA. 


I was only trying to point out that from a security point of view, the
cost of attack against the primitive is less important than how it is
used.

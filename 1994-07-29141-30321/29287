   It wouldn't be hard at all to do some sort of "expanding" transformation
to ciphertext so that it would be compressible.  This would be a simpler
way of keeping Eve off your back that sending megabytes of .GIF files
back and forth with the low-order bits twiddled.  (Of course, Eve probably
looks at random-looking data files from people known to be cryptographers
with more suscpiscion than from other people.)

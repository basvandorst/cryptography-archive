In general, every encryption cycle you add will it make harder to
decrypt your stuff.  There are exceptions, though: two times ROT-13
will reveal back your plaintext.

You have to add the key lengths: two times IDEA, and one time triple
DES.

Yes.  It could make an attempt easier, if you re-use an key.

It will depend on the trapdoor.  Some trapdoors will go away with
the increased number of encryption cycles perfermed, some won't.



Think of crypto as a "never-never-land".  Most things, you have
to trust, unless you want to get a crypto expert by studying it,
and exercising cryptoanalysis every day.  You can assume, that
triple DES and IDEA are quite good, and perhaps, it is right,
that a combination of both (first triple DES, than IDEA, or the
other way round) is at least as strong as the stronger of these
two ciphers.

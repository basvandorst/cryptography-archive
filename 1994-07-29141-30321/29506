Well if you really want to spend $2000 getting the disks and taking
responsibility yourself, you could just buy a plane ticket to the USA,
get the disks and whatever else you wanted, and have a nice vacation
while you are at it.  Of course then if the customs agents found
floppies in your luggage on your way back, we might learn answers
relevant to another thread in this group, namely the one about "rubber
hose cryptanalysis"... :-(

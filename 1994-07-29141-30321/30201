	The standard argument against compressing data after
encryption is that a decent encryption algorithm will not
leave enough redundancy in the text to make the data 
compressable.
	But what if you encrypted again, this time with a 
stronger algorithm, after encrypting with a simple substitution
cipher (which would leave the data with the same statistical
properties it had before) and then compressing it? Would that
buy you anything? Would you be better off, worse off, or the
same as if you had merely compressed and then encrypted?
	Also, some compression algorithms can compress data
compressed by other algorithms. For instance, it's my understanding
that data compressed with Lempel-Ziv can be later compressed with
huffman code or arithmetic coding. What if you had something 
like the following:

substitution cipher+Lempel-Ziv+substitution cipher+Huffman Code
+strong encryption (such as IDEA)


Just how stupid a question am i asking?

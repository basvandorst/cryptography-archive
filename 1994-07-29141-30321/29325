Ok, here's an idea.  This allows you to encode 1 (sorry, just one) plaintext
block as you requested.
Alice and Bob agree to use a cipher in CBC mode with 
key K1, and initialization vector IV1 for all messages, 
along with K2 to be used as a "duress" key, to be revealed to 
the authorities upon receipt of threat or coercion.
	
Alice wishes to send a single plaintext block P.  
She computes ENCRYPT(K1, P^IV1) = C;
She then selects a dummy message D and computes 
IV2 = DECRYPT(K2,C)^D;  She then transmits IV2,C.
	
Bob receives IV2 and C, discards IV2 and computes 
DECRYPT(K1,C)^IV1 = P, using the previously agreed upon IV.
	
The Spanish Inquisition arrest Bob and threaten him with 
the Comfy Chair and Soft Cushions if he doesn't reveal his key.  
He reveals K2.  The Spanish Inquisition compute 
DECRYPT(K2,C)^IV2 and get D, which is non-incriminating.
	
Can anybody think of a way to extend this to multiple blocks?

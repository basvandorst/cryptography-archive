You're out of luck. I don't think there's any barrier to exporting 
DES-encrypted data, but you can't ship the means to decrypt it (except to 
Canada.) Export of any implementation of DES or any other 
worthwhile encryption algorithm without an export license, 
including source code on disk, is a violation of the International Trade in 
Armaments Regulations and a felony. You can generally only get export 
clearance from the State Dept. for a specific sale to a specific customer 
in a specific country.

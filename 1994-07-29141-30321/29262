: Alice wants to send Bob plaintext message P. She makes up a dummy message

  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
: as D. She makes it obvious where P ends and D starts. She then encrypts P'
: to get C and sends that to Bob. Bob and Alice both then add K' = C XOR D' to
: a dummy one-time pad that they keep in case they have to give something to
: the secret police later.

This seems  like a clever suggestion.  I suppose the only other possible 
implausibility is that Bob and Alice would use a one-time pad at all, 
when PGP or the like was available.

Just one question.  It doesn't make any difference what the first D is, 
does it? I've added a prime symbol to the second usage, where 
K' = C XOR D', just to differentiate the two.  The *padding* D could be 
just a string of zeros, or better random noise, and need not be the same
as D' as far as I can tell.

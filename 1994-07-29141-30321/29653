  I have a question on reversingthe roles of PGP keys -- I havn't seen 
this discussed anywhere, so I'll bring it up.

The Idea:

  First distribute my "private" key to a group of people, but keep my 
"public" key confidential. After doing this, I would be able to encrypt a 
message, and everyone in the group would be able to decrypt it, with no 
worries of it being a faked message.
  A real-world application could be delivering orders to a battle-field 
commander, or a company making use of this to eliminate fake releases 
that are really viruses.

  How secure would such a scheme be? I havn't seen anything saying it's 
ok, but I've never seen anything to the contrary either. I was reminded 
of this while reading the thread on the pathetic PkZIP "AV" 
authentication system.  I know RSA/PGP is quite secure the other way 
around, and am curious just how secure the reverse of it would be.

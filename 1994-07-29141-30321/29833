According to the February 93 issue of mac world, DiskLock INCLUDES THE
DES KEY along with encrypted files and is hence useless. All other features
were broken by the author, as well. For example, Disklock modifies the
scsi driver to require a password ... updating the scsi driver bypasses the
protection.

Sorry, but disk lock seems like a most definite NO GO.

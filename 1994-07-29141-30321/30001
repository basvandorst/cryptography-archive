   I have not sat down and tried to solve the cryptogram but I have 
run a few tests on it, and these tests have led me to suspect that 
the system does not involve a transposition.

   I list below the trigrams which have frequency greater than 2. 
Consider the trigram QWO. If there is a transposition involved and 
these three letters are coming together by chance, why don't the 
other permutations of these letters (WQO, OQW, etc.) also have high 
frequency? The same goes for NBG. Although one if its permutations 
(BGN) does have high frequency, this could be explained by some pair 
like AND-NDA (if the language is English). 

   Another fact which makes me wonder is the existence of repeats 
like IWANBG, NBGIN, INLW, and WAXN.

	In the real world, there can be quite a gain in hiding your
system.  Yes, your opponenet will find out what you are using,
eventually.  Hopefully, that will be a strong system.  However, if
your opponent has to determine what you are using that will slow them
down.

	Theres no reason to give away information.  (Trying to make
one system look like another is probably not worth the compute cycles.
Stripping off the PGP header might be; its quick and easy.)

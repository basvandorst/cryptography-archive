I have no doubt that an anagrammist can extract plaintext from a
transposition-only ciphertext.  The problem is, as the Friedmans
pointed out in great detail in their debunking of the Baconians
(_The Shakespearean Ciphers Examined: An Analysis of Cryptographic
Systems Used as Evidence That Some Author Other Than William
Shakespeare Wrote the Plays Commonly Attributed to Him_) is that
anagramming of long messages can come up with many different
plaintexts, even ones with diametrically opposed meanings.

As a specific example of the latter we have:
  No kidding, Francis Bacon: I wrote these plaies! --Shakespeare
and:
  No kidding! I, francis Bacon, wrote these shakespeare plaies.
A skilled anagrammist can probably concoct a dozen or two other
"plaintexts" from this batch of letters.

As to "how short", it varies.  With the letters "OPST" we get:
  post pots spot stop tops
plus the more questionable:
  p.t.s.o. (parent, teacher, student organization)
  opts  (programmerese for "options")
  sopt  (sopped)
wheras with the letters "ESSTT" you pretty much wind up with the
word "tests".

This sounds potentially interesting, even if it turns out to be irrelevant
to the system under study.  Can you post an example of one of these tests?
The whole point of *multiple* anagramming is to provide a test by which
it can be determined whether the anagram you are creating has a reasonable
likelyhood of being the correct anagram.  Sure, you can get a little extra
help by playing off one text against the other, but the most important
point is this "reality check" aspect.  Other tests that can show that
one's anagram is more than a chimera would be quite useful.

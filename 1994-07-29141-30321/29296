"     I really can't let this one go.  While I agree that the US

"*some* foreign governments with even more restrictive policies.

First of all, I feel like the U. S. government wants to be able to eavesdrop
on **any** conversation.
I will also agree that there are many government overseas who have an even more
ardent interest in finding out what is going through the wires. In fact, I
knew that all along...
But I also know that there are governments overseas who do not believe that
special legislation to preserve their ability to eavesdrop on any conversation
is warranted or even desirable. All it takes is one such country with
sufficient technology, and there are many.

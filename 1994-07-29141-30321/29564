Which raises another interesting issue - I notice in the FAQ that the
designated archive of this newsgroup may not be exported from the USA.

It is not clear where this policy comes from, but given that the original
documents in this archive have all presumably been freely distributed
around the world with USENET, it doesn't make much sense to me.  Is this
just a matter of the archive keepers keeping squeaky clean (as is their
right), or is there some other wierd principal operating?

Anyone else been archiving the feed outside the USA?

Cheers, Dieter.

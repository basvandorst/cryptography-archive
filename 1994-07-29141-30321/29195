Unlike the Cripple Chip, SHS' algorithm is publicly available. NSA has
also been heavily involved in designing DES, and regardless of any
paranoid claims, this cypher has done a pretty good job in the last
ten years or so. If you think that SHS is not secure enough - the
algorithm is available, prove your claims.

Of course, it would be nice if disk encryption software allowed the
user to plug in their own modules. This way everybody could use
whatever they trust - MDC/SHA, MDC/MD5, DES, IDEA, whatever.

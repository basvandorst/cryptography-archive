Hear, hear. Actually, I think Bruce's discussion of protocols is *much*
more important than any discussion of cryptanalysis could ever be. After
all, the book is "Applied Cryptography".

Most readers want to know what's out there and how to use it, not how to
break a cipher or design their own. Such a user needs to consider their
prtocols very seriously, since that's the portion of their 'cryptography'
that they are likely to be designing.

Of course, many readers want more. Instead of a second edition, perhaps a
Volume II is in order?

hi.  please help me with the following.  i have a b.s. in mathematics and i am
interested in cryptology.
1)  what kind of programs are available in grad school to learn more about crypt   (all i know so far is what i've learned in an intro to number theory.
2)  where does one find jobs related to crypt.  other than NSA?

thanks,

noelia

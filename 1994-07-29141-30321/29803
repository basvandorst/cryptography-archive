According to the Friends of Big Brother, you are required to have an
export license to export crypto s/w.  Even though DES is relatively tame
and can be read fairly easily by the NSA and even though *lots* of people
outside the US have it, the whole point of the export controls is to prevent
the creation of a crypto market and commonly available crypto products.

You *should* be able to get a license... let us know what happens.
(I bet you just give up...which is *EXACTLY* what the Friends of Big
Brother want you to do :)

2/93 was a long time ago. There was another program with a similar name.
Are you talking about Shayer's Disklock? 

It is false to call it "broken" if one first unlocks a disk with the

taken to extremes the spurious notion of freedom without responsibility, and

are told by their pals that they are in the middle of the road. Nothing is
wrong any more (except, of course, conservative thoughts and expressions).

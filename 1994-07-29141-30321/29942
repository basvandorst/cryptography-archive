First off--including even an 8-bit hash of the DES key would be insecure as
it would reduce the effective keysize to 48 bits.  If they were to, e.g.,
produce a 64-bit hash of a passphrase, use 56 bits for the key, and store
the other 8 on disk that wouldn't be too bad, but it would aid dictionary
based attacks.

As for using custom drivers, what if someone hooks the SCSI drive up to a
PeeCee.  PeeCee's don't have any trouble reading and writing SCSI disks,
and I doubt if a driver written in 68000 code would do a whole lot on a
PC.  The only way a custom driver would improve security would be if it
were run ON THE DRIVE'S CPU; even there, one could always swap controller
boards on the drive.

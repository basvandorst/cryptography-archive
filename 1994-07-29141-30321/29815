Ah, but who judges whether your "small changes" can or cannot damage
Mr Zimmerman's reputation? You? Or Mr. Zimmerman?  That's the crux of
the question, isn't it?

There you go.  He has the copyright.

There you go. the *CODE* (not his name!) is available etc etc

And because of his name, I might add, and the continued care and
involvment he shows to PGP.

Tom, I *urge* you to change the name of your program to something else
than PGP.  There is more than enough confusion going around at the
moment with the innumerable version number alphabet soup that more
confusion is not needed.

Sincerely,

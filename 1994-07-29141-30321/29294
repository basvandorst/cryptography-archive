Fine. I withdraw my criticism for representing the findings as those of the
entire body, and replace them with criticism of the use of "USACM" to refer
to a small committee as subject to misinterpretation, as my attorney friends
say.

It is particularly offensive when it is used in a headline or topic, since
most of the general public has no idea that USACM is a small special-purpose
committee, and, knowing what the ACM is, thinks it is the U.S. ACM making
this pronouncement, and thus the body of computer professionals have
approved this view.

To the contrary, as another reader has pointed out, ACM takes no political
positions by policy, which makes this usage "USACM" particularly subject to
criticism and suggests a propaganda group with an acronym chosen to
mislead, in my view.

taken to extremes the spurious notion of freedom without responsibility, and

are told by their pals that they are in the middle of the road. Nothing is
wrong any more (except, of course, conservative thoughts and expressions).

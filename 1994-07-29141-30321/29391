Hello there,

  I can buy Applied Cryptography from one of the technical book-of-the-month
type clubs for $25 and this seems like a good deal, but I have three questions
that I hope people can answer for me:

  First, the pub date for the book is Dec 1993, is this the latest edition?

  Second, I know there is an errata file, can someone please point me to it?

  Fifth, how can I acquire the diskette(s) with code fragments, etc?

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks.

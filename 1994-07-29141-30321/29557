Millions of others will probably post this too, but...
When 'we aliens' enter the US, a card is stapled into the passport.
On leaving, the check-in agent takes the card. I assume this is then
used to reconcile who's in and who's out.

The prime purpose of Customs everywhere is to keep stuff out, not in.
Thus they do not run routine checks on exports. The only time I've had
problems exporting stuff was when it actually had customs paperwork
attached, which has to be checked outbound. I once nearly missed a plane
while the customs inspectors at Gatwick confirmed that 3 1/2" floppy
drives are not a prohibited export.

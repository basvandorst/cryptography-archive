I think we'll have to agree to disagree on the specific question as to
whether writing a computer program can be "making" a patented device (if
the patent is a method patent, as both STAC's and RSA/PKP's are).  I think
it clearly is not.  Barsky, if your quotes are accurate, didn't consider
the question.  Microsoft clearly sold (use of) programs covered by the STAC
patent, so the question of whether "making" the program is infringement
didn't need to come up.  Phil Z cleary didn't.  (BTW, I thought STAC v.
Microsoft also claimed trade secret violation in both directions, as well
as patent infringement on the part of Microsoft.  I haven't seen the text
of the court decision reached before settlement, so I don't know what legal
issues were actually considered.)

About a year ago on one of the newsgroups I (then) subscribed to, it was
reported that a lawyer offered to defend (for free) the poster, if the
poster was accused of patent infringement for writing (but not using) a
computer program which "uses" some "patented algorithms".  Basically, if a
computer program can be "made", and is "the subject matter of (patented)
invention", then the patent covers a mathematical algorithm, which is
specfically non-statuatory (not a valid subject matter for a patent). 
Hence, only running the program could be an infringement.  (Of course,
distributing the program could easily be contributory infringement.)

I am not a lawyer, and this is not intended as legal advice.

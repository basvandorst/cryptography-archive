Use another name for your program.  Zimmerman's right; you shouldn't be
using the name PGP for a modified algorithm.  The Copyleft license
allows you to use the code, but not the trademarks.  The passages you
cite support that.  Zimmerman's disclaimer about not assuming liability
does not mean his reputation won't be tarnished by a bad version of PGP.
It's not fair for you to do that.

Put your algorithm in a program with a new name, and build your own
reputation for it.

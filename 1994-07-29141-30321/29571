Terry:
	While you have a valid point, does it not sound to you like you are
pushing the edges of a "conspiracy theory" here..?  Ultimately, *every*
cryptography system requires some certification of keys, either by an
exchange of keys for secret systems, or third party certification.  The
PGP system has a "fingerprint" of the key so that verification can be done
quickly and without revealing the whole public key.  There are various
levels of trust, also built into the system.  If you certify a key without
really knowing the person providing the key, or are "coerced" into doing so,
who can we blame but the person?  It isn't the system.  The Apple get-a-notary-
to-sign-your-form system is similarly vulnerable, as is secret key exchange with
someone with access to blank official documents... Personally, unless I have
met and exchanged keys with the individual to whom the key belongs, the key is
*not* trusted completely.  If you do otherwise, that is your problem.  As stated
in the docs...

jna.

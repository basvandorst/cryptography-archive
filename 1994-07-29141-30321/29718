I don't have conversations with pseudonymous people any more than anonymous
ones. I assume good faith when someone posts something that doesn't seem
like an obvious pseudonym. This isn't about absolute proof but about taste
and rules of thumb, within the time available to scan a From: line or
signature as well as a message.

For Talmudic disputation please go to soc.culture.jewish or your
neighborhood Chabad House. And if you like that kind of discussion, probably
it's better to talk about something more important, like Bava Metzia, not
about whether someone wishes to respond to anonymous posts or not.

The values that define our common-sense world are under assault. Some have
taken to extremes the spurious notion of freedom without responsibility, and
are trying to tear down moral guardrails. Those who live on the shoulders
are told by their pals that they are in the middle of the road. Nothing is
wrong any more (except, of course, conservative thoughts and expressions).

hello, folks.
 
i got rsaref and i noticed that they use fermat test to test
primes. i also noticed that they apply only one such test to
each candidate number. i'd like to ask if anyone can tell me:
 
 1) what is the probability that a random composite number
would pass that test?
 
 2) are there any other (better?) tests for prime numbers
available, what are they, and where can i find some docs or
source code to them?
 
yeah, and also, key generation routines use public exponent
either 3 or 65537. what are the advantages and disadvantages
of each of those two, and is there any problem with using any
other odd number as the public exponent?

Unfortunately you told us that you are under investigation by the FBI.
If we were to help you harm a lawful federal investigation, we would be
obstructing justce, a serious crime.


Disclaimer: the following information is not to be used contrary to law

To quickly learn about practical cryptography, you will first want to
read the Cryptography FAQ available by anonymous ftp from rtfm.mit.edu
or from the news.answers or sci.crypt spool.  You may also want to
subscribe to alt.security.pgp and learn about the most secure 
cryptography program on the face of the planet.  You will also want to
become familiar with secure disk, a utulity for encrypting virtual disks
with a strong cipher.

Now if you were trying to keep an 'opponent' form reading your files,
people might be able to specifically help you.

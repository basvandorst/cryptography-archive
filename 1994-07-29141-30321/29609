Nathan, your points are not helped by a cheap shot at almost
everybody's favorite punching bag, D.S. (I say "almost" because a few
of us really despise ad hominem attacks....attack Sternlight for the
_points_ he makes, or the _reasoning_ he uses, but not with cheap
shots.)

I strongly support the various uses of anonymity and pseudonymity,
being one of the founders of the Cypherpunks group, but there are some
very real issues here:

* "nobody@shell.portal.com" could be any one of hundreds or more
people who have used this particular remailer. "phoenix@max.tiac.net"
is fairly likely to be who is represented (yes, forgeries are
possible, but...). Thus, it is completely reasonable to say that, for
example, "phoenix@max.tiac.net" has a more persistent reputation than
"nobody@shell.portal.com."

* Digital signatures can be used to establish a persistent personna,
even if the physical ID, or "true name," is unknown. This takes time,
though. For example, on the Cypherpunks there is an extremely
competent programmer who releases a lot of code for tools, remailers,
digital cash, etc. He uses the digital pseudonym "Pr0duct Cypher."

* This situation is vastly different from random anonymous messages.
Which, like David Sternlight, I take not very seriously. 

* I'm not arguing for any legal rulings on "anonymity." And the
Supreme Court agrees (case involving folks passing out fliers in a
public place...cops tried to get them to reveal their
identities...Supremes held that free speech does not require
IDs...other laws may, depending, but not speech and the like).

* In fact, anonymous and pseudonymous messages will be competing with
other types of messages. I, for one, take a message from "Derek
Atkins" or "David Sternlight" a lot more seriously than one from
"anonymous." That's common sense. Reputations matter.

: Give it up, David.  You're looking for personal authentication

No, he's stating that he doesn't place much credence in anonymous
messages. A personal choice. I ignore most anonymous messages, for
reasons that I gave above, and also because people often save their
most clueless, flamish comments for "anonymous" postings. 

(Some pseudonyms, like Black Unicorn and Pr0duct Cypher, I respond to
as I would to any more normal identity. The value of what is called a
"positive reputation.")

And whether forgeries are possible or not is not so important _at this
moment_, as we've see very few cases on this forum of forged
identities. Even the guy who though I was Satan incarnate, L.
Detwweiler, was only able to do crude .sig block forgeries, not to
manipulate the From: field so as to really fool folks.

Longer term, digital signatures will make these issues moot.

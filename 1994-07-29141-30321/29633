The Powers That Be are loathe to give an exact line.  The best answer I 
have gotten so far was from someone in the export control office of the 
U. S. National Security Adminstration.  She said that they acknowledged 
that the First Amendment to the U. S. Constitution guaranteed free 
discussion of math, including cryptography, in international forums.  The 
things they are most concerned about are ready to run hardware and 
software products that implement strong cryptography.  The way I 
interpret that is that posting complete source code for PGP to a news 
group would anger the NSA, but posting source code for just the IDEA 
algorithm all by itself would not be something that they would 
prosecute.  Posting source code for yet another simple substitution 
cipher would certainly not bother them.

What does this have to do with sci.crypt?  Just this:  if 
sci.crypt.research gets started as a moderated news group, then I don't 
think that U. S. based moderators need worry about the usual discussions 
pertaining to the math, science, and art of cryptography and 
cryptanalysis landing them in jail.  Of course, it would be good to have 
some moderators in other jurisdictions, too, just to strengthen the 
safety of this position.

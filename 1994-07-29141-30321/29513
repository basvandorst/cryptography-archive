My general rule is that the use of proprietary algorithms should be
restricted to the proprietor.  Only he knows the things that I need to
know to choose his algorithm.  History suggests that he often does not
know what he thinks that he knows.  (Read M. Blaze on TESSERA.)

In the specific case of Clipper/Skpjack I know almost nothing.  I know
what the proprietor asserts. ( I also know that he is the world's largest
eavesdropper.)  However, I am unable to get him to even make assertions
about some things that I consider to be important.  For example, he will
make no assertions about the relative strength of keys.  He will not even
acknowledge the question.  In the case of the DES, I know that with the
exception of the short list of "weak keys," all keys are of equal
strength.  In the case of Skipjack, I do not know that.

The proprietor himself raised the question.  For the last algorithm that
he suggested for public use he admitted that the overwhelming majority of
the keys were weak, at least to him.  In other words, there was internal
structure to the keys, that only he knew about, and that would enable him
to read traffic encrypted under (most) keys chosen at random.  Is this
true for Skipjack?  I do not know; the proprietor remains silent.  I
certainly know that in a 80 bit key space there is room for more strong
keys than the DES has with sufficient room left for the majority of keys
to weak.

Now, if you wish to enter into a discussion about how to choose an
algorithm, that is for another day.

If they first encrypted with a REAL BAD method, that created certain 
statistical distributions or constants, it could assist some attack on a 
second "better" encipherment.  Also, the two encryptions might interfere with 
each other.  Try XOR ing with the same one-time pad TWICE for EXTRA SECURITY, 
to see what I mean.

	Give Me A Break.  This is so dumb it's incredible.

	Were you born a jerk or did you have to take STUPID pills to
get that way???

	I find it incredible that you are so stupid and arrogant in
your stupidity?  I'm dead set against clipper.  I sent faxes to congress
promoting the bill to lift of the ITAR export restrictions.  I'm a user of
PGP.  I have an access account for RIPEM.  And... I've got my copy of CFS on
the way so I can examine it myself.  I simply requested it.  But I didn't
try hidding behind an anon remailer.  Wonder why they don't trust you?
I wouldn't...

	Proof beyond a doubt that you are a JERK.  OF COURSE they're not
going to send you that software through the anon.penet server.  Do you
think they are half as stupid as you appear to be.  You have to indicate
that you are a US or Canadian citizen to get this software (remember ITAR).
You also have to provide an E-Mail address inside the United States (kinda
blows anon.penet BIG TIME).  You also have to agree to the non-export
license agreement.

	Gee this sound real similar to the hoops you have to jump through
to get pgp2.6 from MIT or to get access to RIPEM up at Michigan State.
Try getting either of those while hiding behind anon.penet.

	Anon.penet aka anon.penet.FI is not even in the United States.
You are asking for restricted software while using a foreign site to do
so.  How stupid can you get???  Duh...  I agree not to export this software
but I'm calling from FI...  Duh...  You don't know me but trust me...  Duh...

	You were actually asking them to willfully violate the law by
shipping that software out of the country to get to you (where ever
you are).  And you wonder why they said NO???  Now pull your head out
and ACT LIKE YOU'VE GOT A CLUE!

	Note:  I'm dead set against the ITAR restrictions on encryption
software.  However, it would be dead stupid for a corporation like
AT&T the ignore the ^&*! things and send something out of the country
in direct conflict with the regulations.

  Getting close, but as you point out silly.  If our two conspirators
had an initial secure channel, especially if it was hand-to-hand, they
could pass the dummy leftover pads, which never need replacing.  (They
are never used, and thus never used up.)

  The code for the "real" program is even simpler.  Have a phoney
protocol which includes a digital signature appended.  No one will
find that strange.  Now, knowing a "magic" number K which acts as a
key (and perhaps a seed for the digital signature algoritm, "sign"
each block of the the "dummy" OTP, xor it with the dummy OTP shifted K
bits right, and out pops the real cryptographic program.  If there are
plenty of bits of redundancy in the OTP file this is a good
stegnographic approach to concealing the program.

   If you want to get fancy, the "dummy" OTP protocol will use the
digital signature in a block chaining mode "under" the OTP.  (We
weren't all that trusting of our random number generator...)  Makes
getting the code out of the OTP easier, since you don't have to apply
the signature block by block.

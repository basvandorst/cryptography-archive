I'm debating the merits of the following hybrid DES/hashed based system
on cipherpunks right now. It looks like it provides four times the protection
of DES without decreasing the speed much.

Step A: Choose four DES keys, K1, K2, K3 and K4

Step B: Run the code through your favorite non-secure diffusion based cipher.
        Slightly hacked linear feedback shift registers work just fine as do
        many other algorithms.

Step C: Hash the concatenation of K1, K2, K3 and K4. Use a secure one-way hash.

Step D: Multiplex the plaintext into four messages using each pair of two bits
        in the hash. Keep repeating the hash when you run out of bits.

Step E: Do DES encryption on each of the four messages. Concatenate or
        Interleave and send. DO NOT USE ECB.

Does anybody see a way to cryptanalyze this more easily than by using
((2^47)^4) ciphertexts. It looks like this algorithm can be extended
to arbitratily large key sizes. It also looks like, for any reasonably
large plaintext, this is substantially faster than double DES.

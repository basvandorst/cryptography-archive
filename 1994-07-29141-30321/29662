RSA can certainly be used in this manner.  The implementation of PGP cannot
be so used, because the private key contains enough information to derive
the public key.  At least, I was told so by someone on the alt.security.pgp
news-group.  It seems that the implementation stores the prime factors in
the private key for efficient modular arithmetic.

Given the prime factors and the private key exponent, the public key can be
easily derived.  Hence distributing your `private' PGP key would enable the
recipients to derive your `public' PGP key.  Then they can fake messages
from you, and the advantage of using a public-key system would be lost; one
may as well use a symmetric-key system.

Obviously, the PGP public key does not contain the prime factors, but only
their product.

DISCLAIMER: I'm only repeating what I was told.  I can't remember who said
it, but he seemed to know what he was talking about.  To verify for
yourself, extract your private key to a file and parse its contents.

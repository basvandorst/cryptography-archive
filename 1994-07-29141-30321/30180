No. SHA loses information when applied to any text longer than 160 bits, so it
obviously can't do encryption. More over, its a one way hash function without
a trapdoor, so there is no way to reverse it in a usefully short period of time.

That said, you can use just about any secure one-way hash as a building block
in an encryption algorithm in the style of Mesage Digest Cypher (MDC) and
Luby-Rackoff (spelling ?-} ).

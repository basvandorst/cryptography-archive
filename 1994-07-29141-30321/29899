I've been wondering about this point myself.  We're currently talking
to DigiCash (David Chaum's Amsterdam-based company), whose products
use RSA for signing operations and such.  So far, their products have
only been sold in Europe, where RSA patent infringement isn't an
issue.  David's protocols can accomodate any asymmetrical encryption
algorithm, but even if we were to adopt DSA or something for use in
the U.S., I'm worried that RSADSI might decide that the stakes are
sufficiently high to press their "we own everything" attitude in
court.

Any thoughts?

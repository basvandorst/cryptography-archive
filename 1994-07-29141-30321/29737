I'd thought I should clarify the naming of the proposed group a bit, the reason
I put sci.crypt.research in the RFD is that it follows the pattern of a number
of other groups which have both * and *.research sections.  This doesn't mean
that the only thing which can be posted is research-related material, since
there is much may be of general interest but isn't necessarily research-
related.  The important deciding point is the charter of the group rather than
the name, and I believe I've made the scope wide enough to cover anything of
interest.
 
Moderation: For those people who were wondering about the amount of work
involved, it looks like there'll be plenty of volunteers so if you're worried
you won't have the time for it, just leave it to the others.  The list of
volunteers so far is:
 
  David Wagner <dawagner@princeton.edu>
  Derek Atkins <warlord@MIT.EDU>
* Greg Rose <greg_rose@sydney.sterling.com>
* Mark Lomas <tmal@cl.cam.ac.uk>
  Matthew Mastracci <Matthew.Mastracci@matrix.cpubbs.cuug.ab.ca>
* Michael Paul Johnson <mpj@netcom.com>
  Paul Kocher <kocherp@leland.Stanford.EDU>
  Paul Leyland <pcl@foo.oucs.ox.ac.uk>
* Peter Gutmann <pgut01@cs.aukuni.ac.nz>
  Tony Lezard <tony@mantis.co.uk>
 
Those people with asterisks next to the names have already sent me information
on themselves, if anyone who's left and who hasn't already done so could
scribble a few sentences about themselves and mail them to me, I'll collect
them and post them here once I've got all the submissions or when I get tired
of waiting, whichever comes first.  Just a quick outline of why you'd make a
good moderator is fine, an example of the sort of thing I'm after might be:
 
  I have been interested in cryptography ever since I was unable to spell it at
  a spelling competition when I was 9, and a few years ago released my major
  programming effort, Pretty Average Privacy (PAP) which for some reason wasn't
  as successful as I was hoping for.  Last year I published my book
  "Differential Cryptanalysis of the rot13 Algorithm", and my current work in
  progress is a hardware implementation of the Caesar salad cipher. I would
  make a good sci.crypt.research moderator because my Jolt corporate
  sponsorship means I can stay awake and logged on 24 hours a day.
 
Peter.

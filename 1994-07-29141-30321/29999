Unless you are interested in spending your time and money on attorneys,
I'd suggest you get an opinion from the State Department first as to
whether using OCR would transform a book into software. I know there are
many arguments that can be made of the form--well modern software can read
ordinary book text now. However, the enforcement of the munitions laws has
proven to be arbitrary in many areas. Unless you are willing to take the
chance of going down in flames and getting pinned down as to your time and
money, bad idea to do this without checking.

We know you can't export certain of your material on disk. We know you can
in "ordinary" book form. What we don't yet know is how the government
would rule on machine-readable paper which is "deliberately" (as in OCR-B)
machine readable.

Of course if you have an agreement from someone such as EFF to defend you
and assume costs, and are willing to be a martyr for someone's cause
(maybe even your own), go right ahead without checking.

I know some will think having to check with the government first in this
matter might be chilling, not to say a violation of one's Consitutional
rights, but I'm not saying he has to--just that he should consider the
possible costs as well as the benefits of such an action.

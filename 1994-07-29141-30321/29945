	The data encryption techniques used by PKZIP are available (in US 
and Canada anyway) in a supplementary file for the INFO-ZIP versions of 
the same ZIP algorithms.  The normal version of INFO-ZIP's code has a 
dummy crypt.c file so that it's legal for export, but the fully 
functional crypt.c is available at:


   NOTE 1:  Non-US users, please do NOT ftp from the US sites (US
   regulations and all that).  Likewise, US users, please do not
   ftp from the European sites (it's not illegal, but it sure is
   a waste of expensive bandwidth).

   NOTE 2:  Some sites may carry both encryption and non-encryption
   executables with slightly different names; for example, zip201c2.zip
   instead of zip201x2.zip ("c" == crypt version).  Other sites may
   include *only* the encryption-related executables (zip and zipcloak)
   in a second archive (e.g., zcryp20x.zip).

   From the US:
      ftp.uu.net:/pub/archiving/zip/zcrypt20.zip

   Outside the US:
      garbo.uwasa.fi:/unix/arcers/zcrypt20.zip
      ftp.inria.fr:/system/arch-compr/zcrypt20.zip
      ftp.informatik.tu-muenchen.de:/pub/comp/os/os2/archiver/zcrypt20.zip
         (mail server at ftp-mailer@informatik.tu-muenchen.de)

      ftp.win.tue.nl:/pub/compression/zip/...
      ftp.uni-erlangen.de:/pub/pc/msdos/utilities/zip/...

(from the file "Where" included with the ZIP201 Info-ZIP source)

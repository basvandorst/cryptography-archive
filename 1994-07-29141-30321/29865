 I don't know.  As far as I know, there is no published math to
 tell us.

 The whole point of BB&S is that we have a published construction
 and validation which ends up giving us a provably unpredictable
 sequence.  Thus, the BB&S math gives us certain things, and
 without properly constructing N and checking X0 we do not have
 those things.  Consequently, it is extremely inappropriate to use
 "Blum, Blum, Shub" to lend an undeserved air of mathematically
 provable security to a system which does not properly construct
 N or check X0.

 As far as I know, nobody has published such an analysis.  Short
 cycles are probably rare, but we don't know how rare.  And if we
 are willing to use a non-proven approach, there are many which
 are much, much faster than X**2 mod N.

 First, we apparently *know* how many weak keys there are in IDEA.
 But we *don't* know how many short cycles are in an improperly
 constructed N.

 I have published the results of some experiments on small BB&S
 constructions in [1:120-121].  When P and Q are only "Blum
 integers" (that is, congruent to 3 mod 4 but not "special"), the
 minimum cycle length (other than the four degenerates) is small,
 and the average cycle length appears vastly shorter than a
 properly-constructed N.

 Next, even if short cycles are rare, they exist.  The advantage
 of BB&S is provable security.  Even a rare possibility of
 insecurity is not provable security.  While this is not necessarily
 bad, it is deceptive to use the name BB&S for this condition.

 The real answer is that I am not aware that anybody has published
 such knowledge, but the indications I have are not good.  And, in
 any case, this is not BB&S.

Your method would work fine to solve this problem, and is the standard
usage of PGP.

This thread started when someone else (Justin Dolske, I believe) suggested
an alternative, simpler, method.  In his method, all the recipients are
given the SAME decryption key, and they agree to keep the decryption key
secret.  This method would work fine as well, as far as RSA is concerned.
It can actually be carried out using PGP, but the PGP implementation would
permit the recipients to compromise the method, by allowing them to derive
the encryption key and spoof messages from the sender.

My posts described why Mr. Dolske's method is flawed.  I won't repeat their
contents here, except to say that a person able to decrypt a PGP message
using a PGP secret key can construct the corresponding PGP public key.

In article <Ct1vK1.55o.3@cs.cmu.edu>, I wrote:

To carry out Mr. Dolske's method, the pass-phrase SKphrase would have to be
given to Bi.  Carry out his method using PGP and you'll understand the
necessity to do so.

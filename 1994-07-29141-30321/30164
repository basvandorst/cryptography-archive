This assumes facts not in evidence about the details of the MIT-->PKP
arrangements and whether all patent holders gave their patent ownership over
to PKP in exchange for a piece of the action or not.

The values that define our common-sense world are under assault. Some have
taken to extremes the spurious notion of freedom without responsibility, and
are trying to tear down moral guardrails. Those who live on the shoulders
are told by their pals that they are in the middle of the road. Nothing is
wrong any more (except, of course, conservative thoughts and expressions).

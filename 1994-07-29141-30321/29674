	Tom...Phil is right..As a lawyer, I can tell you that he owns the 
PGP name and for you to distribute your version of this under the same 
name is legally and really ethically wrong...No quotations from the 
Copyleft can change that.

	You can do all the mods you want but put the finished product out 
under some other name. If you bought a Nissan because thats what it said 
on the outside of the car and later looked under the hood and found 
something else, you would be upset. It doesn't matter if what you found 
was a Yugo or a Rolls Royce..Its just not what the package said...
	Keep doing your mods because thats what this is all about but put 
your stuff out as your stuff, not with someone elses name on it....

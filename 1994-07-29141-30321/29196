		I said, Skipjack has no 'weak keys.'  In this context, I used
	weak keys to refer to those keys that result in a significantly weaker
	encryption (a DES key of all 0's or all 1's is weak, as are 14
	others.)  See Applied Cryptography, page 232 for details.

I beg your pardon!  A skipjack key of all 1's or all 0's *is* weak!

You give me a skipjack chip and some text encoded with a random key and
if it turns out to be either of those two keys I bet I can break it :-)

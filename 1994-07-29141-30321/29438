SecureDrive is freeware and comes in source. It has been written in
the USA and its export is subject to the ITAR restrictions. This
probably explains why I don't have the latest version. The latest
version is 1.3e and should be available from some US ftp sites; but I
never bothered to remember which ones. If version 1.3d is good enough
for you, you can get it from our ftp site:

This summer I'm writing a "digital cash" system for transactions
over the Internet, and I want to use a public - private key system
for the digital signatures.  I would use the standard RSA
algorithm, but the RSA people are in bed with CommerceNet and don't
want to license the algorithm to potential competitors.

Thus my question:  does anyone know of and/or have some good
references (books, papers, anything) on non-RSA public-private
key encryption algorithms?  I have heard of systems using the
knapsack problem and discrete logarithms, but have been unable
to find a good reference.  Any help you could give me in tracking
some down would be greatly appreciated.

Also, I'd be interested in hearing any opinions or expertise about
the following question:  at what message size does it make sense to
apply a hash algorithm (say m5) before you encrypt?  I'm going to
be sending packets of about a kilobyte in size and encrypting them
with 512 and 1024 bit keys and I'm wondering if it is worth the trouble
of hashing them first.

Please reply by email and I'll post a summary of responses.  Thanks.

Since it is illegal to distribute cypher systems outside of the usa, I 
was wondering what the distribution of this newsgroup is, e.g. worldwide?

If someone posts the algorithims, or code sample for something new, how 
do they keep it in the usa?

I use tin in a unix environment, and can't see any way of settign the 
distribution, nor do I see a distribution limitation on postings.

( I don't have anything to post, I am just curious about this.)

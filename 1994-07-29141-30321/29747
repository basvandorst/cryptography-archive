Ok.  Thanx for all the tips guys.  Im a newbie (obviously) and I am just getting all the basics down so I can movve into bigger stuff
Now how about this added to the previously mentioned scheme in order to get rid of 
repeated key attacks:
XOR the block to be encrypted i by the plain text of the previous block.
The first block would have to wait for last and use the last block to be XOR'd with
How would this improve this scheme. (Im not looking to get a crypto graphic breakthrouh, but just looking for practice and advice on 
making and breaking them)
Thanx.
PS- Why is 256 and multiples there of a bad choice for block size?

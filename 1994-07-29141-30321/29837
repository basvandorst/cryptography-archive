PGFORMAT.DOC, available with the MITPGP2.6 distribution, lays out the format 
for a secret key certificate, which contains the various components of the RSA 
key. A particular byte, occurring after preliminary info concerning the public 
modulus n and the public exponent e, specifies that the following fields are 
encrypted using the IDEA cipher. Those following fields are defined as d,p,q, 
and u.
In the PGP source, specifically RSAGEN.C, "u" is defined as the 
"multiplicative inverse" of p mod q if p<q, or (p*u) mod q = 1. That's as 
close to an answer as I can come.

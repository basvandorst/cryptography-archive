I seem to remember (about 4-5 years ago) a announcement on a piece
of encryption hardware that was the size of a 3.5 inch floppy disk and
that went into the floppy disk drive on a computer.  It was supposed
to have hardware that did a RSA (I think) encryption (with software
on the computer sending and receiving the data.)

Does anyone else remember a British company offering this?  If so,
what happended to it?


Thanks for your time,
Ron

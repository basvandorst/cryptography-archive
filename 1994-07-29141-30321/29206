In this sense the principle is clear: only use keys generated
in a random manner.  Preferably "truly" random (quantum noise),
but cryptographically-strong pseudo-random will do in a pinch,
as long as your seed value is unguessable.  Use such a key for
at most one session before generating a new key.

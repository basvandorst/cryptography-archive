A minor point.  ITAR is not a law.  It is regulations interpreting a law. 
It may be the case that the regulations are not authorized by the law, and
it may be the case that the law is unconstitutional (US Constitution), but
I agree with DS that you would be a knave for asking, but that an
individual aware of the legal status, and willing to fight the validity of
the law would be justified in doing so, if he is willing to take the risk
of the severe penalties for violating the law.

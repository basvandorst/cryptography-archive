   Hmmm...  You are refuting something that I didn't say.  Whether or
not production of PGP 1.0 infringed on PKP's patents is not at issue.
You said that Phil IGNORED the RSA patents.  I pointed out that from
the beginning, whether or not he infringed the patents, Phil has paid
attention to them, and informed potential PGP users of the patent
situation.

   See above.  It is not a "self-serving inconsistancy" to develop a
product and struggle to get it out the door.  It is a fact of
business, in this country and elsewhere, that first you develop a
product, then you find out what is needed to market it.  You can't
just go to Walt Disney or whoever and say, "I've got a great idea, but
I need a license to your Mickey Mouse trademark."  You have to have a
product in hand and probably a marketing plan as well.

   If RSA, Inc. and PKP had determined that their interests were
better served by bringing an infringement case, I assume that they
would have done so.  (Lots of us think they would have lost, but at
this point in time I doubt that they could even get a case to court.)
They did not file a suit and currently it is possible to buy a
licensed version of PGP, or get a version released by a member of the
PKP consortium.  To convict Phil in absentia of a crime he was never
formally accused of seems to me to be self-serving in extremis.

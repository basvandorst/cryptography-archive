The answer is an unqualified MAYBE SOMETIMES. :)

Some compression algorithms and some encryption algorithms result in
straight-forward signatures that can be used to identify data which
has been processed with those algorithms.  Most compressions
*PRODUCTS* and encryption *PRODUCTS* will deliberately add signatures
even if their underlying algorithms don't have signatures in order to
make it easier to identify the output data they generate as such.

In cases where there is a signature, the answer to your question is
clearly yes.  In cases where there is not a signature, it is possible to
analyze the file pretty carefully and determine that whether it is
likely to be a compressed file or an encrypted file, but you will not be
able to be absolutely certain whether it is or not.  Encryption
algorithms tend to output data which looks like random values unless you
know the key(s) used to encrypt the particular data, even if you know a
priori what the encryption algorithm is.  This appearance of randomness
makes it that much more difficult to guess what encryption algorithm
might have been used.

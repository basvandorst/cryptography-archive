This is true; what it really implies is that the prosecution and the 
defense will get into a pissing contest over the meaning of the 
message(s). The problem we're dealing with here is not strictly a 
technical cryptological question(how's that for ugly phraseology?). Since 
we're positing an actual trial, or at least preliminary hearing, we're 
now dealing with issues of credibility, image making, attack, rebuttal 
and so on. The proscecution may have all sorts of evidence against you, 
of which the supposed content of your messages is only one piece. If you 
can credibly show that you used a complex, non-XOR form of encryption to 
encrypt innocuous messages, you may go far toward nullifying the effect 
of other prosection evidence. On the other hand, if it's a wash as far as 
who the jury believes when it comes to the meaning of your messages, your 
lawyer might have to work twice as hard to counter the other evidence.

Having said all this, don't get the idea that I'm planning to knock over 
the Federal Reserve; this is all just an interesting intellectual 
challenge as far as I'm concerned. :-)

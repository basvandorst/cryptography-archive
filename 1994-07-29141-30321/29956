I am very interested in Zero Knolewdge Proof applications, and I should like
to ask you about any reference relating Secret Sharing and Secret Funds, like
how can be controlled the money that the police use for dificult to explain
services. In Spain we have seen a hard to belive story with the Director of
Guardia Civil, a kind of local FBI, that is accussed of corruption, and now
out of our country with a lot of official secrets. It is supposed that he
kept in his pocket almost all the secret funds for terrorism and drugs fighting.

Luis Roldan is one of the names that Spanish History will remember in the years
to come, and many of the data and proofs founded have many things to do with
computers, communications, and Cryptology, but it is necessary, from my point
of view, to connect it with a Theory of Police Information.

I would like to write about it in my doctoral thesis.

Thanks before hand for any information, idea or reference you can provide.

Cervantes dreamed "El Quijote" close to the place where my PC is now!

The result on cycle lengths in BB&S's paper is of a limited theoretical  
interest but practically useless. It doesn't say anything about possible  
regularities in the cycles other than exact repetitions. Would you use the  
sequence 101101110111101111101111110... for encryption?

On the other hand, even with `true' random numbers (whatever these are)  
you have a small chance to get a bad sequence (e.g. 000000000...). The  
main result of BB&S says (modulo QRA) that when you choose the parameters  
big enough, the chance of getting a bad sequence from the BB&S generator  
is not `significantly' worse than with a true random sequence.

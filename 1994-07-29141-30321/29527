 I respectfully disagree with the final sentence.

 Crypto-trained users may possibly be able to take sufficient "care"
 to make PGP secure in the sense of a well-designed cryptosystem.
 But ordinary users would be unlikely to do so.  I think that a
 number of users have indicated that if such care were in fact
 required, they would not bother to use the cipher.

 I believe most users expect that _the_simple_use_ of a cryptosystem
 will provide communications secrecy.  Users do not expect that a
 cryptosystem will seal their mouths, or hide their papers, nor do
 so for the user at the other end.  However, they _do_ expect that
 the ordinary use of a cryptosystem will prevent _anyone_else_ from
 reading their traffic.

 Most users do not expect that a cryptosystem will require detailed
 manual key-certification (or validation) to prevent others from
 reading their traffic.  Users assume that if this sort of complex
 technical process were actually required for real communications
 security, it would done by the cryptosystem itself, and not have
 to be provided by the user.  Alas, this assumption is false.

 Indeed, PGP users are encouraged to believe that the testimony of
 other users is sufficient to "certify" a public key.  But casual
 third parties just might be informants, either for cash or as a
 result of threats against their job or their family.  A system
 insecure against the coercion of a casual third party--who has no
 vital interest in your security--is not much of a cryptosystem at
 all.

 It is a fact of cryptographic life that we must acknowledge
 security limitations by the user at each end.  But a good
 cryptosystem will not _also_ require us to consider the amount
 of "trust" we have in _other_ individuals.  No other individual
 can possibly be trusted to the extent of the security provided by
 even a modest serious cryptosystem.

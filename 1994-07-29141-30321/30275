[deleted:  What should be the place of the NSA?]

I think this would be a fine topic for alt.politics.org.nsa.  Although I
sometimes sound like I am harshly against the NSA, actually I'm not.  It's
an organization I have respect for, and I
think they have a rightful place in our system.  The trouble is in
defining that place.

I do not want them making policy.

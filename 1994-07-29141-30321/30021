But ViaCrypt and MIT are using a properly licensed version. Presumably this
means that Mr Zimmermann, who carefully oversees use of the name PGP, has
changed his mind about whether the RSA patent is valid or not.

If he has changed his mind and recognizes that the RSA patent needs to be
licensed, then that is tantamount to admitting that he wrongly infringed
with 1.0. On the other hand if he is licensing now because it is expedient,
then perhaps his motives or radicalism has changed into something else less
appealing.

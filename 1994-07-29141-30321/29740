I currently am using norton's [in]diskreet ver 5.0 I am currently under 
investigation and I need a secure disk beyond the FBIs capabilities, if 
there is one.  I would like to have it as a virtual disk if possible but 
I can use an individual file type encryption if needed.  I have 124 Mb of 
stuff I would like to encrypt in a drive but only 10Mb I NEED to 
encrypt.  Please email me and if you can give me an ftp site which I can 
pick up a sufficently advanced crypt program.

Thanx in advance

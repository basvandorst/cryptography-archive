Well now, davy boy has me in his kill file, so he won't be able to read 
this, but here it goes anyway.  Perhaps some kind soul not in his killfile 
could be so kind as to draw his attention to it.

When was the last time you voted, as a whole, in the CFR on any issue.  Do 
they often send out balots?  Or perhaps, are there advisory reports issued 
from time to time by specialized groups?

I am pleased to hear that you have had a hand in all of the CFR's decisions, 
and personaly voted for/against all of their positions, or are you 
misrepresenting your position?

Roger.

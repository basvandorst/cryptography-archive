Also, when the RSA algorithm was discovered, the patent office held that
algorithms were not patentable.  Q: So, how'd they manage to get their
patent?  A: It wasn't until 6 or 7 *years* later that the RSA patent was
issued.

If the patent had been disallowed, as it should have been, there'd be
no basis for complaint against Phil on intellectual property grounds.
Or, even if a patent had been issued promptly, then the argument would
soon be moot, since the patent would be expiring about now.

As for the feds and their grand jury investigation of Phil, they are
trying to close the barn door about 17 years after the cows got out.
Going through some old papers, I recently found a take-home quiz on
RSA trap-door encryption, from Prof. R. N. Chanon's CS395T class at
the University of Texas.  The test's due date was September 21, 1977.

My recollection is that about half of that class was foreign students.

Phil, if a copy of that quiz would be of any help to you with your
legal problems, I'd be happy to send it to you.  I'm one right-winger
who thinks that you've been unjustly persecuted by the federal gov't,
even if you are a left-winger.

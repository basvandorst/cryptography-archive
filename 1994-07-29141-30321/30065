     What about the O-L-D endings of the lines?  I think that this might be an
     indication that one is supposed to group all the lines ending in "O"
     together etc.  I also suspect that there might be a little bit of mixing
     going on.  Rather than a full-blown transposition, how about taking the
     remaining 39 letters of each line, dividing it into 3 groups of 13 letters
     and permuting them, e.g. as 2-3-1, 3-1-2?  This would break the
     pattern of the line and in combination with line mixing there would be
     quite a bit of mixing.  
     
     Alternatively, the O-L-D may refer to different patterns of permuting
     13-character blocks within the line.   Has anybody done 2- and 3-gram
     analyses for lines ending O vs. L vs. D?   The one thing I'm sure about
     is that it is a monoalphabetic substitution.

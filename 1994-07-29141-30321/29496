First,	Grand Juries RARELY subpoena the accused.
Second,	even if they do, the accused does not have to answer any
	questions (5th ammendment, doncha know).
Third,	the reply seems inappropriate. The question is: will the Feds
	actually attempt to bring such a thing to court? I believe the 
	point is that the Feds don't WANT to bring up substantive issues
	for reasons of secrecy. Some spies have been sent from the
	country declared persona non grata rather than prosecute them,
	because the Feds didn't even want it known that certain secrets
	existed. (So I understand.)

Grady, be nice. If it weren't Phil and his courage to oppose a
bureaucracy trying to crush him, we might not have had the freedom you
are talking about or even PGP itself. Besides, I am not aware of him
"grubbing for money". All he is asking is that the jerks do not
distribute hacked version of his program disguised under the name PGP.
He is not stopping anybody from using it, hacking it for his/her own
use, or even distributing the hacked versions under *another* name.
All that he is asking is not to call "PGP" something that isn't. After
all, he wrote it, and all legalities aside, it is at least *polite* to
respect his wishes. Don't be ungrateful, he is not asking that much.

Regards,
Vesselin

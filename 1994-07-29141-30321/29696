I thank everyone for their help/criticism in my past posts.  I've been 
able to get ahold of a few good encryption algorithms (IDEA, DES, etc).
I'd like to have a program to determine the frequency distribution of the 
ASCII table, to see if encrypted output is 'visibly random' (no peaks in 
frequency).  I'd be using it on UNIX.
Thanks for helping out a crypto-newbie.

Matt

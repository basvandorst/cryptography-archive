Yes.  It is read all over.

But many minds would dispute the first assertion that export of cypher
code is illegal.  We have only the assertion of the Friends of Big Brother
that it is.  It really hasn't been tested much in the courts.

In reality, they can not.

Some newsreaders (like elm or pine) do allow you to specify a
distribution per the approprate RCS field (whatever these Internet
stds are).  However, it takes only one site to ignore this and pass
the info on.  There are now multiple hundreds of thousands sites in
the Internet.  I can occasionally read osu.opinion on a system that
gets its Usenet feed from a site in Washington DC :)

The best comment on this comes from Tim May's .sig which is something 
like 'national borders are just speedbumps on the information 
superhighway'.  In cyberspace, the earth is only one second wide.

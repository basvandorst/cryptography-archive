If I understood you right, this quoted text is the crux of your
encryption scheme; the rest is just a key transformation.  Again
assuming I understand you, what you are saying here is you take
your key (randomized password) and do essentially the following
(simplified for clarity of function):
    k = key;
    while ((c=getchar()) != EOF){
      if (!*k)
	k = key;
      putchar(c ^ *k++);
    }

This is a well know weak polyalphabetic substitution cipher.  In
addition to the ordinary attacks on such ciphers, it can also be
attacked by "running text" style attacks if two messages in the
same key are available.

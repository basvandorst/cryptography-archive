   Well, I feel better now.  I spent a few hours on this one before
deciding it was beyond my ability.  Unfortunately, my meager abilities
didn't take me very far.

   I dropped the "000", natch, and counted 196 digrams, 18 unique.
Frequency counts suggested the distribution was very English-like, and
that solution would therefore involve substituting letters for numeric
digrams and possibly transposing.

   Thinking in terms of a checkerboard alphabet (5x5), I did a quickie
substitution and looked at the result; setting it up as a 14 x 14 matrix,
I saw that the only three letters with frequency == 1 were at the ends
of rows 7, 8 and 9.  Digram and trigram analysis of the matrix were
useless, which suggested transposition of some kind; the three-letter
clue suggested Nihilist transposition to me.  Unfortunately for me, my
abilities aren't up to fooling around with a substituted transposition,
and I quit there.

   What the heck, it kept me off the streets.  The hubcaps of the neighborhood
were safe for a few hours...

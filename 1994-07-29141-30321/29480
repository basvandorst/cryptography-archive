PICs are available very cheaply as OTP devices.  (i.e. they are EPROM
type devices but packaged in plastic with no quartz window).  People
have already discovered that devices such as these which have security
bits than can be set to prevent program data being read back actually
have the security bits on a different area of the die to the main data
array.  As a result you can stick a papermask over the die with a hole
in the appropriate place, put it in an EPROM eraser, and so 'turn off'
the security bits whilst leaving the program memory untouched.

Experimentation with the ceramic/quartz window package version of
the product shows you where.
With the OTP package you've just got to get the plastic out of the way
so you can see the die.  (No - I don't know how easy this is never
having tried).

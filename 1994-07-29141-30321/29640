Program the computer to "recognize" likely plain text, such as plain 
ASCII text (all high bits zero), common compression headers, common word 
processing, spread sheet, and graphic file headers, etc.  This does 
increase the cost of the brute force key search, but only by a linear 
amount.  Don't bother the human operator (especially me) unless you have 
a likely plain text file.  There may still be some false alarms, but I'd 
rather look at about 100 files of garbage instead of a few quadrillion of 
them.  :-)

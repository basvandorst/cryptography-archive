The U.S. Government doesn't have specific laws against transmitting
encrypted messages across or within their borders (yet...)
Other governments may; supposedly France does.
On the other hand, the U.S.Government currently does have laws against
saying certain kinds of things in messages, encrypted or not,
such as "here's the source code for my encryption program".
The NSA is rumored to eavesdrop on transborder conversations
(and has done so in the past), so please don't use *wimpy* encryption,
especially since good encryption like PGP is available.

PKP controls all useful patents for public-key algorithms.
(This I was told by a PKP principal.)

This would not however preclude the possiblity of some pre-PKP
arrangements being grandfathered into place.  It is
very plausible that MIT had such arrangements (beings as
some of the work was done there), and that even though
these hypothesized grandfathered arrangements were not
explicitly made part of any MIT PGP license arrangement,
their existence was used to leverage the ulitmate 
arrangement with PKP.

In other words, we probably don't know exactly why the
license arrangements are the way they are, and probably
can't find out from public information.

 If anyone is licensing RSA's BSAFE package as part of a product, what 
 kinds of prices are they quoting to you?  RSA used to have a $15K/2-year
 license with no royalties for startups, but that doesn't seem to be 
 available anymore.  Now they mention a one-time $7500 fee, plus 
 royalties: 2% of net.  Is M.Chen right that there are no real guidelines - 
 it's like buying a used car from a dealership?  
 
 And, are there alternatives to RSA's P-K cryptography gaining acceptance?

   This is a total misstatement of fact.  Lots of PGP users may have
ignored the PKP patents, there is no evidence that Phil Zimmerman ever
did.  The only legitimate objection would be that the original PGP was
subject to a Catch-22:  Only legal to use in locations it could not be
exported to.  But that would also be incorrect.  The use of PKPs patents
in research and development of new products is explicitly legal,
although products once developed are subject to the patents.

   Since versions created in Europe and used overseas, and versions
2.4, 2.5, and 2.6 are all legitmate with respect to the PKP patents
(whether or not those patents would stand up in court),  Phil
Zimmerman has complied with both the letter and the intent of the law.
(Of course, in my, non-binding on anyone, opinion.)  I think Grady
owes Phil an apology.

 I think what he was trying to say was that there was no need for MIT to use RSAREF
 since they are the patent holders. They could have used say Zimmerman's
 implimentation instead. This might have opened them up to breach of contract suits
 by RSADSI but not to infringement suits. ( I agree if that was what he intended to
 say it could have been phrased better).
 Whether their license would be valid if it really did violate their agreement with
 PKP and RSADSI I do not know. It would presumably depend in detail on the
 agreement, and the mood of the court on the particular day the case was heard. But
 this speculation is somewhat moot since MIT did come to areement with RSADSI re
 the use of RSAREF, and we as users are bound to RSADSI both through their own
 license on RSAREF and through the MIT license. 
 It is true that we as users could probably use the fact that we got the program 
 from the patent holder to fight an infringement suit, but that scenario always had
 negligable probablility.

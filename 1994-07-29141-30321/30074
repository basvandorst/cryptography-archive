Apologies to Stanton McCandlish for misspelling his name in my previous post
of the above topic. It was inadvertent.

While I'm at it, I understand he has just completed his Ph.D. and I want to
congratulate him and welcome to the ranks.

The values that define our common-sense world are under assault. Some have
taken to extremes the spurious notion of freedom without responsibility, and
are trying to tear down moral guardrails. Those who live on the shoulders
are told by their pals that they are in the middle of the road. Nothing is
wrong any more (except, of course, conservative thoughts and expressions).

This was to generate the keys.  If you generate another key, you will
encounter this process again.

The *session* keys (used for each encryption) are generated by a
cryptographic pseudo-random-number generator which does not need keystrokes
(although any heystrokes you type are used).

From the time delays beyween your keystrokes, filtered through a
cryptographic hash to remove patterns.

Because you are no longer generating primes for RSA keys.

D is included in the message so that Alice and Bob can use it to generate
the same dummy one-time pad. When the secret police threaten to use the
thumbscrews, Alice and Bob hand over their identical pads which decrypt the
intercepted communications into the same innocent messages. The fact that
both of them have a copy of the pad lends credence to their claim that it
really was what they were using for their codes. Otherwise, as someone else
has pointed out, anyone can come up with a one time pad to decrypt any
message into anything, after the fact.

Is anybody else aware of the errors/typos in the source code
for the Blowfish algorithm in Dr. Dobbs Journal, April 1994,
pp. 98-99?  I do not subscribe to the magazine, so I do not
know if corrections were printed.

I can post or send my corrections to anybody who is interested, 
unless David S. advises me that I could get into serious trouble.

I sent a list of some of the errors I found via email to Bruce
Schneier, but I cannot confirm that he received them.

The most troubling problem to me is the line in the
function F....
y=((S[0][a]+(S[1][b]%32))^S[2][c])+(S[3][d]%32);

which I replaced with...

y=((S[0][a] + S[1][b] ) ^ S[2][c]) + S[3][d] ;

It seems, at least intuitively, that the %32's, which reduce the
result to 5 bits, weakens the implementation presented in the
block diagram on page 40 (Figure 2).

Please respond by email to mmorgan@solar.ee.stcloud.msus.edu

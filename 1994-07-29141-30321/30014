        All true - but none of it gives you the right to use Phil's
        documentation or call the result "PGP" or anything that might
        lead the rest of us to believe that Phil had anything to do
        with your little monster.

        A scam is a scam is a scam. Using copyleft to justify
        it is pure and simple assholery.

        Cheers,
                Marc

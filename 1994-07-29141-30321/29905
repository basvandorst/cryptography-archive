One approach designers might take is to reduce their reliance on
public-key encryption software, thus reducing the cost of
licenses for this specialized type of software.

Private-key encryption is not necessarily that much more
difficult to administer, within a suitably defined domain in
which keys can be securely distributed.  One model I find useful
in a client/server architecture is to use private-key encryption
between a client and its server (e.g. within domains), and only
use public-key encryption for server-to-server communcations
(e.g., across domains).

Note that a server may make available public keys for all of
the clients (or users) within its domain, perhaps numbering
in the thousands, while still having only a single copy
of a public key encryption product on that server.

If one has thousands or tens of thousands of nodes or users,
one looks for ways of avoiding paying for an overpriced
software license for each user.

The substitution ciphers add so little to the cryptographic strength of 
the above scheme that I would consider them a waste of time.  This leaves 
the combination LZ+Huff+IDEA, which is very similar to ZIP+IDEA, which is 
what PGP does and is widely regarded as strong.  In general, compression 
should always be done before encryption for maximum effectiveness of both 
the compression and increase in strength of the encryption.  If you were 
inclined to do some superencrption as well, a good way would be to do 
that with unrelated ciphers after the compression, like, for example,
ZIP+IDEA+DES.

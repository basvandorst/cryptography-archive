If you happen to lose your bet, make sure you check his ID 
thoroughly to make sure it is really him. He has announced his 
refusal to interact with anyone who cannot prove their identity 
to him, so turnabout is fair play. <g>
 
Let me make a wild guess, BTW.  "Sternlight" will scold you for 
soliciting the publication of classified information, and warn of 
the "dire consequences" for doing so...

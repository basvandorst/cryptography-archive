Many people will be confused if the name PGP is used (even if as only
a part of) in a product that clearly isn't PGP. The current "version
chaos" is confusing enough; do we really need to make the situation
worse? Why don't you direct your attacks to where the danger is really
coming from?

PGP is strong crypto for the masses. You are certainly overestimating
"the masses" if you think that they will be able to clear up the
confusion for themselves. Take a look at alt.security.pgp and count
the number of "OK, so *what* is the latest PGP version?" questions
there.

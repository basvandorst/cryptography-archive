Another small group of elitists with delusions of grandeur misrepresenting
themselves. in both the Subject and in the body of the announcement it is
represented that the USACM adopted this stance. It did not. A small
committee of the ACM did, and as far as one can tell the matter was not
referred to a vote of the membership.

If I were still a member I would demand the members of the committee be
censured for thus misrepresenting the matter.

A typical extract from the post is:
" In a position statement released at a press conference on 
Capitol Hill, the USACM said that "

The ACM did no such thing. At best the members of a committee of the ACM
did.

(I have a vested interest in this matter. I was one of the original members
of ACM, and until I moved from computer programming to economics had a
complete set of the Journal dating back to V1N1.)

The values that define our common-sense world are under assault. Some have
taken to extremes the spurious notion of freedom without responsibility, and
are trying to tear down moral guardrails. Those who live on the shoulders
are told by their pals that they are in the middle of the road. Nothing is
wrong any more (except, of course, conservative thoughts and expressions).

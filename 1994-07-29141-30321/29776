A most interesting thread to follow.  But I feel that most everyone, 
including Mr. Ward, is missing a huge point.  This forum exists because 
Mr. Zimmermann wrote a piece of software that became a world wide (should 
I say Net wide) phenomonon.  A peice of software that has been 
extensivily research, tested and most importantly, accepted by a large 
section of the computing population.

You need not agree with Phil's ideas nor his use of a particuliar 
algorithim, but, you should have the decency to accept his desire to be 
in moderate control of a product HE produced.  If others seek to improve, 
alter, change, or otherwise bastardize someone elses product, they should 
at least have the decency to do it under another name. (if they cannot 
obtain permission from Phil)

A difference of opinion does not warrant disrespect.

   Much worse than this, using ECB-mode means that your input is probably
highly-patterned (ie, ASCII-encoded text), and that chosen-plaintext
attacks against your cipher can be used.  Using CBC, CFB, or OFB makes
chosen-plaintext attacks impractical.

   If someone builds a DES-cracking machine (currently estimated at less
than $2 million), they can break DES with a small number (ie, 3 or 4)
of known-plaintext blocks, and their corresponding ciphertext blocks.
This requires 2**56 or so encryptions on your special-purpose machine.

   Well, DES was pretty clearly not designed to resist linear attacks.
My understanding is that the best attack against DES is currently
Matsui's linear attack, which requires 2**47 known-plaintext/ciphertext
pairs.
 
   It's probably important to point out the difference between an
attack that's not really practical against a real-world implementation
of a cipher (ie, 2**47 known-plaintexts) but that shows a possibly-
important design flaw, and an attack that *is* practical today (ie,
keysearch machines and 2 or 3 known plaintext/ciphertext blocks.)
 
   In general, chosen-ciphertext attacks are less practical in real-
world situations than chosen-plaintext attacks, which are less
practical than known-plaintext attacks.  This depends a lot on the
whole system used, naturally--some systems *will* be vulnerable to
chosen-plaintext or chosen-ciphertext attacks....

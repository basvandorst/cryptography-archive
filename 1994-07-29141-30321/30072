This may be old hat, and if so, my apologies in advance.

Would  DESinv( RN xor DES( M,key) ,key) be resonable?  RN is either
a single random number of the output of a half-way decent pseudo-random
number generator, M the plaintext.  Note it is not the message which 
is xor'd but the encrypted message.  Since this is a poorly correllated
string of bits, even if DES is trivially readable by certain government 
agencies, stripping the RN would be more problematic than RN xor Message.
Also if a single RN is used to extend the key and if it is larger than
64 bits, the block structure of DES (default mode - no key chaining) 
would be lost which would not help traffic analysis.

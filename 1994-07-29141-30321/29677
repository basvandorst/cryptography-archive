Actually people working in computer vision, texture recognition/segmentation,
use this kind of thing.  

Generally images have spatial coherence, because lighting usually
lacks discontinuities and surfaces are locally smooth.

If your markov model had a "receptive field" large enough, you'd
start finding nipples in your statistical gifs... 

NB: I read somewhere recently (EDN?) that someone at Apple had 
produced a package to hide info in images.

Is anyone familar with a source for national semiconductor's
IPOWER smart card that contains the RSA algorithm. Is it 
available from anywhere except national? Seems they don't
always answer their phones. Are there any second sources for
the IPOWER or even another smart card that implementes the 
RSA algorithm suite?   Any info would be much appreciated.

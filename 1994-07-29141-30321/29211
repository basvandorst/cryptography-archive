As I try to get a grip on PGP key management on a multi-user
system, Some very thorney questions come to mind.  I assume that
you can trust your copy of PGP as unmodified.

1.  Is it possible to use a message digest to verify that your
keys have not been tampered with?  Then you could just check the
signature of your keyrings when you logged on.

2.  How feasable is it for an attacker to tamper with my secret
ring?  UNIX security notwithstanding.  Presumably, an attacker
could not deduce my passphrase cryptographically.  

Thanks for your time.

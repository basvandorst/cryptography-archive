 The only way I can understand this comment is that, if we re-design
 a cryptosystem periodically, we can continue to increase its
 strength at essentially constant cost, because we have new
 equipment on which the new cipher runs.  But DES is a 20-year-old
 and never-improved or re-designed cipher, which is not this
 situation.

 Based on other comments not in evidence, perhaps the comment means
 that a cryptosystem designer can produce a cryptosystem which uses
 the "primitive" in a stronger way.  And again I reply that this
 is itself another cipher--essentially an extended DES--and should
 be as openly defined and discussed as the "primitive," if anyone
 is to be asked to trust it equivalently.

 Exponentially increasing computational capability places DES at
 risk, not just because of the key-exhaustion attack we usually
 consider, but also because of the ability to better analyze the
 cipher itself.  The advantage goes to the cryptanalyst, who now
 sees a fixed-strength "primitive" which is at most only slightly
 out of reach.  If a much-easier attack on DES exists, it is more
 likely to be found with better experimental capabilities.

 Should that "primitive" fall, and depending on how it falls, the
 surrounding system may be the only cryptographic strength which
 remains.

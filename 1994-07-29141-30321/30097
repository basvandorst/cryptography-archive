One simple one is a CRC (preset to -1) with a secret polynomial.  If
you generate a suitable CRC polynomial at random, compute the CRC and keep
it secret (if you expose the CRC, you can find the GCD of a few messages
with CRCs and extract the polynomial), someone trying to modify the file
without detection has to guess the CRC.

Normal CRCs are quite trivial to spoof.  If you give me a file, and
specify n bits in it that I can set arbitrarily, I can make it have
any CRC you like.

Of course, if you don't want to akve to keep secrets, you can use a
cryptographic hash like MD2, MD4, MD5, HAVAL, SHS (old or new), etc.

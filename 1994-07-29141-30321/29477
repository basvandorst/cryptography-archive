	WinCrypt is a windows utility that encrypts files.  It uses
a 1 to 128 character password.  It takes this password and converts it
to a 512 character block which it then exclusive ORs to the file.
This makes sense to me even with my limited encryption knowledge but
at the end it says something that puzzles me.
 
	The author states that he got some kind of permission from
some Washington group that it would be acceptable to be exported.
My question is why this cypher and who approves such exports?
 
	Is there some flaw in this encryption scheme?
 
Any help in reducing my confusion would be appreciated.

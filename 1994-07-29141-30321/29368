Hi Folks,

A reference was passed on to me in reply to a question I recently
asked, but I have not been able to track it down over here (Adelaide,
Australia).

It was :

    Computers and Security, August 1993, Pfitzmann and Assman,
    pp. 477-500

Is this a serial (journal) or a book with which you are familiar?
Did I transcribe this incorrectly?  

Particularly if you are in Australia: do you have access to this
article - I was not able to find it in the serials catalog for
Australian libraries.

Cheers, Dieter.

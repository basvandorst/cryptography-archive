Well, I like this idea.  It should be possible to identify most plaintext
files.  I think it could be automated.  I think almost all of them have
tell-tale incipits (beginnings).  Think of .exe files for example.

Any file not identified is a candidate encrypted file.

Can anybody think of a legitimate plaintext file that does not have a
characteristic incipit, and that appears random too?

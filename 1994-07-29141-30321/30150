N.I. Koblitz "A Course in Number Theory and Cryptography"
(second edition) Springer-Verlag 1994 (Graduate texts in
mathematics, vol.  114) (ISBN 0-387-94293-9) is a good place
to start for the theory aspect; B. Schnieier "Applied
Cryptography" Wiley 1994 (ISBN 0-471-59756-2) is a good place
for an overview and some C source.

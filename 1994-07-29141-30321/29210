Hmmm... I thought I already replied to this, but I don't see it posted so
I'll try again.  Execuse me if this is a dup.

As I stated in the original post, I don't know enough crypto to
evaluate the encryption schemes for either robustness or weaknesses.
If either package was the only one availble, I'd use it with no second
thoughts.  But, since two different programs with differnt algorithms
are available, I would like some feedback as to the merits of the
differeing encryption systems.

As for the DES and the NSA, this may be true, but governments and motives
change, and the current US Government is teaming up with the NSA to try
to force compromised encryption on the people, with only the government's
promise of "Trust us!" for security.  Why would the same organization that
wants encryption with built-in backdoors, who's job is to break encryption
for the government, release an "unbreakable" encryption like SHS for
public consumption?  This is why I am asking the local experts for
feedback on the encryption schemes.

   On the other hand, once it's been shown that you're using a one-time
pad, and the feds decode the message "AS SOON AS I RENT THAT VAN, WE CAN
GO BLOW UP THE WORLD TRADE CENTER," your attorney can call an expert witness
to testify that, since it's a one-time pad, *any* message could be in there,
including "GEE, I'M SURE GLAD TO BE IN THE USA.  I'D NEVER BLOW UP A BUILDING"

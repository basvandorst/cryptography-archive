Ok, here's the algorithm:

   P = Plaintext message
   P' = Encrypted message
   L  = LEAF field

   P' = P XOR "It doesn't matter, we can always plant a bug"
        |
	L


Seriously, the algorithm is classified and probably compartmentalized
information.  Do you honestly believe that someone would risk spending the
rest of their lives in prison or possibly being sentenced to death just
for the honor of posting it to USENET?  Unlike the Ames and Wallaces, most
folks with security clearances take them *seriously*.

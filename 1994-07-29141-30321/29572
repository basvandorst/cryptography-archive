Wrong again, DS.  If the courts find the law unconstitutional, the action
was always legal.  Unless a court finds that an action is covered by the
law, the action is legal.  When a court so finds, the action was always
illegal. I realize this legalistic hair-splitting is beyond you, but it is
still accurate.

DS has a habit of assuming that his position is mainstream.  I'd rate that
as "not proven".  In fact, the mainstream government position seems to be
that export of publically available crypto software is legal, but that the
person who made it publically available might be guilty of export law
violation.  As PZ doesn't seem to be being prosecuted, there doesn't seem
to be any question about it.

I'm in DS's killfile, so he won't see this, as he won't see my agreement
with his conclusion (but not with his intermediate steps) in one of the
threads in comp.org.cpsr.talk.

I don't know of any electronic copy of this paper (though I'd love to! :-)

ZK proofs are a way to convince someone that you know a solution to a
problem without revealing anything about your (or any other) solution
to that problem.  If somehow, you pick a problem in such a way that
only you know the solution, anyone can recognize you by the fact you
can solve that problem.  In other words, to prove you are yourself,
you engage in a ZK protocol that will convince your friend you know
the solution to that problem you picked.

Well the good news is you can read a fuse blown PIC, the bad news is, it 
will cost you around 100 times more than the subscription (assuming it is a 
smartcard).  

The simple way (?) to re-read a PIC is to expose it to a localised 
radioactive or UV source focused on the fuse area on the chip (note this 
will probably involve removing the top of the plastic package).

You will need several PIC's as the chances are the rest of the program will 
also be destroyed trying to overwrite the fuses.  So in reality there is no 
practical method of reading a security blown PIC (if there was it wouldn't 
really be secure....)

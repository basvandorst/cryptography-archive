This sounds like it satifies my conditions all right.  I suppose I would
classify it (mistakenly) as a possible encrypted file.  

Nevertheless, I think that classifying files by their appearance would
be a useful way to detect encrypted files.  True, the method could be
spoofed, and would occasionally give false indications.  We don't have
to be fool proof do we?

Let me strengthen my claim still further to make it more meaningful.
If person B receives a ciphertext that was encrypted with a secure
cipher by person A, and he has no knowledge of what person A did,
if person B encrypts the text with his favorite cipher and his favorite
key, he has no greater chance of making the cipher less secure than
he would have of cracking the cipher by brute force (tough without any
knowledge of the first cipher). This is given by our knowledge that the
first cipher is secure, as any counter example would violate this
security.

I have thus defined unrelated as meaning the method by which the cipher
is chosen has no knowledge of the first cipher.

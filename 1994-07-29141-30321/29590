	I can verify this technique.."been there, hacked that" on another
manuf's micro (not a PIC chip).. It's remarkably easy to dissolve the plastic
pkg. with nitric acid or HF acid (on a hotplate).. Caveat: Dont try this
@  home.. The stuff we used was <<STRONG>>.. Fume cupboard & prot. gear
MANDATORY!! With correct application, though, chip die AND  all bond
wires/legs arejust fine & remain unattacked by the acid. As I say.. This is not
hearsay.. We actually achieved the objective. 
	The PIC chip is different, though (if my memory is accurate) My reading
of the data sheet for 16c54 was that final security fuse was buried link in
die..an actual fuse, and once blown, no erasure of the fuse is poss. 
	I, too would be interested in the PICbuster info, though!

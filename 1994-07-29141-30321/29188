Good heavens, that's a rather extreme view.

Posting cryptographic program code is not necessarily "provocation".
A computer program is often the clearest way of communicating an
algorithm; indeed some programming languages have this as an
explicit goal.

And about a year ago, you congratulated me on a post to sci.crypt in
which I included an entire program!

I'm not sure what you mean by "specific enough".  Why does being
"specific" make code unsuitable for posting?  As for length, I hope
you're right.  Are you sure that, say, a 20-line fragment can't
violate ITAR?  I'm worried that a US moderator might have to take
a pessimistic line on this.

Anyway, assuming that you now accept that the original poster's
message was motivated by concern over export regulations rather than
some kind of anti-Americanism, I think an apology to him would be
appropriate.

Suppose you start your own digicash right now, and it takes off and everybody
is using it. According to the government of the United States of America,
claims to all public key systems are false. This will likely go to trial,
but the result is that you are in less trouble if you wind up being sued and
you can maintain more authoritatively in negotiations that you don't believe
you are infringing.

Beyond this, the patents that claim all public key algorithms expire in 1997.
How big do you think digicash will get by then. I'd be happy to make a wager
that the total dollar amount of transactions made with digicash (and similar
things) in 1998 will exceed the amount between now and the expiry of the PKP
patents by a substantial amount.

At this point in time, with the patents almost up and the government claiming
that the patents are invalid, its not that unsafe to use non-RSA public
keys. (IMNSHO)

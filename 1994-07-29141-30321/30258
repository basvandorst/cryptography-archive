Public Key makes it much easier and more secure to implement software 
EES.  On the other hand, it is possible to do without it, if you have to 
for economic reasons.  You could hide a fixed "family key" in an 
executable only program (no source code provided) that was used to 
encrypt some "Law Enforcement Access Field (LEAF)" that contained all but 
40 bits (or some other number chosed to balance security with cost of 
spying) of the session key.  The authorized wire tapper would have a 
straight forward brute force attack to perform, but the unauthorized wire 
tapper would have to also figure out the family key and LEAF format from 
reverse engineering the object code.  This may be adequate protection for 
some messages, but not for others.  It doesn't have quite the difference 
in effort that PK provides between authorized & unauthorized spying, but 
it is something...

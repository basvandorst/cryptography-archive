On the other hand, there is now precedent for freely exporting
cryptographic source code (including DES) when it is *printed in a
textbook*. Several months ago, I received a formal ruling from the
Office of Defense Trade Controls that Bruce Schneier's book "Applied
Cryptography" was a public domain item under the ITARs and was
therefore outside its licensing jurisdiction. This despite the rather
extensive source code listings in the back of the book.

A followup request for a diskette containing *exactly* the same code
as appeared in the book was denied; an appeal to the Deputy Assistant
Secretary of State is (still) pending well after the 30 day limit.

I'm reminded of the Classic Trek episode "I, Mudd", specifically the
scene where Kirk and Spock succeed in making smoke come out of Norman
the Android's ears by confronting him with a logical paradox.

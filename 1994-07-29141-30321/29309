There already is a mailing list, but it's virtually unused (the first
postings in about 6 months appeared there yesterday).  As for the moderated
group proposal, I've already posted the RFD, but it could take awhile to
appear as the moderator responsible for handling RFD's is away at the moment
(a bilabial fricative to the first person who uses this as an example of why
moderation is a bad thing :-).

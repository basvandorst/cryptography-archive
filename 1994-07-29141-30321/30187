This could happen, for example, with an N which is "special" but about 400
bits long.  Such an N could be factored with an effort comparable to the
RSA-129 project earlier this year.  However, its cycle length would be
about 2^200, making it impossible to traverse with plausible computer power
during the expected lifetime of the universe.  Once you have factored N
the generator should not be considered unpredictable.

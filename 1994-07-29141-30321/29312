There are lots of places to get the DES 
material.  DES is a federal standard.  So you 
get copies from the NTIS in Springfield VA.  
Also in many of the current books it is well 
described.  Such as "Cryptography: A Primer" by 
Konheim.  I thought I see a book on cryptology 
for computers that had C code for DOS on an 
MS-DOS diskette.

I think this to be an oversimplification. I believe their policy is with
respect to the algorithm, not to a crypto system. In any case, they have a
specific policy (pre-2.6) about PGP versions prior to Viacrypt and prior to
2.6, since those had crossed the line into infringment, and cannot (pre 2.6)
be re-sanitized thereafter. As Phil himself said in the documentation, PGP
is (speaking pre Viacrypt/2.6) contraband in the U.S. That's one reason it
took the intervention of MIT and a totally new version was required before
RSADSI would go along (to approximate the sequence of events).

It's their patent--they get to make the policies, not you or I.

wrong any more (except, of course, conservative thoughts and expressions).

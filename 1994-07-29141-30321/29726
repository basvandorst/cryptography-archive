In conversation with the tech support people for PKZIP, I keep getting statements
like this:

   The only way to break PKZIP's password is to guess at all the possible
   password combinations, so a long password (7 character) is very secure.
   PGP is a very good program, but I don't know which is more secure.

Does anybody out there have an analysis of PKZIP's encryption? I know that 
AccessData lists PKZIP as one of the programs they can recover passwords on, and
I will be calling them. But, if somebody in the Usenet world has looked at
PKZIP, I'd appreciate hearing what you found.

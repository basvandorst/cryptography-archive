	I have corresponded with Mark and my sources are "on the way".
You have to do a bit more than just request the sources from a site in
the U.S.  You have to state that you are a U.S. (or Canadian) citizen, provide
an E-Mail address within the U.S. or Canada (presumably the address from which
you are making the request) and agree to a non-export license agreement.
Then you get the sources E-Mailed to you.  Admittedly you can lie through
your teeth about your citizenship and turn around and ignore the license
agreement but they've done their duties to the lawyers and the goodies are
yours.

An optimist believes we live in the best of all possible worlds.
A pessimist is sure of it!

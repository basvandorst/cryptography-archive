Tommy the Tourist is a frequent psuedonimous poster.  This poster
has built up a reputation under this pseudonym, which is why he
cares.  You would have to base your belief or nonbelief on TtT's
previous reputation, and the primary reason to care would be for
your potential constant-reevaluation of the value of TtT's posts.
If you feel that *any* use of an anonymous server renders the
post rubbish, then you won't care, and the belief is irrelivant.

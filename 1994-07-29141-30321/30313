Huh?! No, you are wrong, of course. It *is* possible to use SHA for
encryption - by using it as a secure hash function in a MDC-type
cypher. In fact, I think that it is possible to use *any* secure hash
function in this way.

I am *really* surprised that you don't know this. I think that there
was a paper describing this - how to make strong cyphers from
cryptographically strong hash functions - but I don't have the
reference handy. Maybe Peter Gutmann can help with the reference - he
seems to like the MDC cyphers a lot.

Oh, so you know it? Why did you write you first paragraph then? The
two paragraphs of your article contradict each other...

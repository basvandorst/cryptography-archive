RSA is not something you would normally use for bulk encryption;
more normal behaviour would be to use RSA to encode a session key,
and then use the session key for encoding with DES or IDEA or something.
I've seen spec for DES chips that will go 192 Mbps; should be fast enough :-)
1.5 Mbps is close to the territory you can get with conventional CPUs
for IDEA, so if there are any special-purpose chips they should have
no trouble, or you couls use a DSP.

Also saw a reference quoted from one of the trade rags that NSA is
working on a chip called FASTLANE to do encryption at OC12 speeds (600 MBps)
for ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) applications; if they don't
succeed with Clipper, maybe they'll be able to sell this one :-(

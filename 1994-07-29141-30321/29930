I think that this whole discussion is taking a wrong turn. I suspect
that the reason for this is Grady, who is attempting to imply that
Phil's objections are of the kind "Waahh, wahh, you are infringing on
my trademark, whine, whine". They are not. The original message from
Phil has expired here, so I can't check it, but I think that it
expressed a completely different kind of concern.

Look, Phil has written a great program that allows the people around
the world to securely communicate between themselves and has released
it for free. Now, if somebody changes a bit the encryption routines in
it, it is very likely that the new program will cause compatibility
problems and may introduce some security holes. This will naturally
ruin Phil's reputation, because most people around the world are
associating the program PGP with him (regardless that much of the code
in the latest versions is not written by him). Phil is concerned about
the decreased communicativity that a hacked version of PGP would
introduce, not about some trademarks.

How about calling the program just '3DEA' and mention in the docs that
with such and such options it is PGP-compatible? Sort of like HPACK is
compatible with PGP-generated keys, although it uses a completely
different symmetric encryption algorithm.

Good question. Stop for a moment and think a little bit. Try to answer
it yourself. Could it be because:

	[ ] Phil agrees with what Mathew has done
	[ ] The modifications in 2.6ui do not touch the crypto stuff
	[ ] Some other reasons
	[ ] All of the above
?

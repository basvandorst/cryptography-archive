   If Bill is just trying to point out that since the MIT version
includes RSA, Inc. source code, they are not entirely out of the
picture, fine.  But the editing implies that I was saying something I
wasn't.  MIT may or may not have negotiated with the rest of the PKP
consortium before releasing PGP 2.5, but they do not need to license
the patents from RSA, Inc.  If MIT and RSA Inc. were to engage in a
legal squabble over patent rights, third parties would not be at risk
if they have a license from MIT.  Stanford could bring a suit which
included third parties, but I can't see how RSA could bring an
infringement action, which any court would pay attention to.  Breech
of contract maybe, but I have no personal knowledge of the
relationships between RSA and PKP.

    (I'm also not a lawyer, although I do know of many--but not nearly
all--of the silly rulings over the years in this area.)

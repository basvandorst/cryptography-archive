	Hiding your ciphertext is called steganography, and there are
programs that will exploit the least significant bits of graphics or
audio files.  Hiding text in plaintext is a little more difficult,
because the plaintext tends to be quite stilted, making it obvious
that something is hidden.

eg:	The hidden enigma quietly undergoes interesting changes.

	Its pretty obvious that not all is well.  This draws attention
to your text pretty quickly.  Encoding data in sound or pictures is
often a lot less obvious.

I am well within my rights to say anything I wish to.  See the First Amendment
(something you seem to have difficulty seeing, IMHO) or ask a lawyer
(something you've always seemed hesitant to do, likely because any good one
would tell you to piss off) if you're unsure about this.  I did not represent
that I was a lawyer.

I can give very, very good odds that anyone who cares to export cryptographic
software from the United States and doesn't choose to do so in an absurdly
stupid or deliberately conspicuous manner will not be caught.  It is a trivial
proof that the odds of that person going to jail are substantially lower than
those of his being caught, even if one ignores the obvious Constitutional
issues.

Did I suggest that anyone do anything?  Go show me where, in my article, I
suggested that anyone do anything.

Feeling those awful little demons of insecurity boiling up inside you again,
David?  Think you can say something oh-so-clever and make yourself feel better
while in fact you're only trumpeting to the world your stubbornness and poor
self-image?  (I won't even get started on your tenuous command of logic and
discourse; if there's one thing I'm sure of it's that you know all too well
about that yourself.)

Know what, David?  You can say what you want, but I'm not listening.  I won't
be reading this thread any more.  Know what that means?  In whatever pitiful
way it's important to you, you _can't_ get your own back.

Personally, I'd recommend you quite a bit of time with a good shrink.

Perhaps you think it's illegal for me to give that advice, as I'm not a
medical doctor?

How about taking an existing 8 bit image and re-encoding it for "16 bits" of 
color?  I don't quite get how the pallettes work (maybe they'd be suspiciously 
large), but there's nothing in principle stopping this.  My "xv" tool today seems 
to discover a lot of colors in a pallette that turn out to be identical (it
purges them and informs you of this).  Also, the same old pictures seem to
be rescanned and sent out over and over again (esp. Cindy Crawford if we
want the old-fashioned cheezecake variety), so seeing CINDY40.GIF is no
particular trip-wire nor would seeing it in a variety of formats (8 bit,
others) be particularly out of the ordinary.

In brief, if you are willing to put up with the expansion factor of
a little more than 2 to 1, I don't see the technology involved as particularly
challenging, technically, and I see the difficulties in distinguishing it,
if decently done, fairly hard.  Heck, there's still some "dithered" pix
running around now and then (less and less to be sure), but the opportunity
abounds, here.

I wonder if you could apply a similar trick to a .WAV file containing
running water (said to be psychologically soothing) that are shared
between friends?

Hmm... What is the definition of "unrelated"? I was thinking of the
following: DES is a secure cypher in both encrypt and decrypt modes,
and produces different results (I mean DESEncrypt (M, Key) produces a
different output than DESDecrypt (M, Key)). Yet, if you do

	DESDecrypt (DESEncrypt (M, Key), Key)

this obviously results in the plaintext message M. In another article
I noticed a vague reference of a result obtained by Mauer, using
"independent keys". Now, what does "independent keys" mean? Obviously,
in my example above they are not independent - they are in fact one
and the same key - but how does one decide in general whether two
cyphers or two keys are "independent" or "unrelated"?

While the claim stated by you does seem likely, I don't think that its
truth is obvious (at least it is not obvious to me); that's why I
asked for a proof.

Vesselin

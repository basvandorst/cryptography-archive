It is my understanding that PGP users are encuraged to believe that
the testimony of other users *that they trust* is sufficient to
"certify" a public key.  Use of casual third parties, as I vaguely
recall from the PGP docs, is discuraged (but allowed, for those
who really want to do something that foolish).

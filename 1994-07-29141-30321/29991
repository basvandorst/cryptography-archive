 The argument I imply is that if they had felt that relying on QRA
 were by itself sufficient to imply cycle-length issues, they would
 not have had to do another specific analysis *without* it.  Thus,
 the argument that cycle-length issues were covered by the earlier
 QRA-based discussion is clearly false.

 Note that this quote says "*these* periods," implying a single
 overall BB&S design.  But section 8 introduces a new construction
 which requires that P and Q be "special" primes, and not just any
 arbitrary "Blum" prime as we might be led to believe from section 7.
 But the brief introduction in section 4 has already warned us that
 cycle-length issues will be postponed to section 8.

 It is obvious that no RNG could be "unpredictable" in any real
 sense without having a "long enough" cycle.  But section 8 does not
 give cycle lengths for X**2 mod N systems based on arbitrary "Blum"
 primes; there is no math to guarantee *any* minimum cycle length
 whatsoever for such a construction.  BB&S only discusses cycle
 lengths for the "special" prime construction.  Thus, only the
 "special" prime BB&S construction can be realistically considered
 "unpredictable."  And that means that only the "special" prime
 construction can be considered the "real" BB&S design.

 I'm a little sorry to be arguing "scripture" here, but if the
 paper were absolutely clear, unambiguous, and trivial to interpret,
 we would not be having this discussion.  Still, there are many
 other parts of the paper which point to the same interpretation.

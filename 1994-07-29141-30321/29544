The only program that I am aware of that might do it is PC/DACS for 
OS/2, if it is released in an updated form that provides encryption. 
HARDWARE security with (DES) encryption is available for the ISA/EISA 
buss from OKIOK in Montreal, but needs some work on key control in my 
limited humble opinion.  Products CANNOT use DOS type interrupt 
calls... and must use device drivers.  Last I heard from all of the 
various third party security product producers was that they were 
waiting for IBM to release the (long awaited) Security APIs for OS/2. 
I somehow do not see this happening before IBM has a security product 
for OS/2 that provides adequate encryption, and similarly do not see 
such a product from IBM if the US Govt has any say in the matter...

Chao!

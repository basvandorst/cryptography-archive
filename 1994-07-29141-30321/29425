Then the TfengBorg simply echos the encrypted text and logs in under your
password.

PGP was meant only to provide a channel secure from observation.
It is not sufficient to do this alone when dealing with passwords.

I'm not familar with how secure hashing systems work.  Assuming this
is a one way encryption scheme, how is the server going to check
the users password, which is assumed to be stored in the database
already encrypted with a one way encryption scheme?  The random text
has changed...

I run a Netrek WWW site, something like the following command should connect:
%mosaic http://obsidian.math.arizona.edu:8080/netrek.html
For NCSA Mosaic binaries: ftp ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu:/Web/
For text terminals, get Lynx: ftp ftp2.cc.ukans.edu:/pub/WWW/lynx/

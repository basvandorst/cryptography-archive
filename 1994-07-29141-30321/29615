Where can I find the FAQ's to this group.  I had them but no longer. :( 
Pls point me to an FTP site.  Also a question:  How would you go about attacking this system?
Blocks of plaintext are taken in either 256, 512 or 1024 chars per block.
The key is of the respective size 256, 512 or 1024 digits.  Where the key is one 
of the permutations of the size's factorial value.  The plainttext block is then 
is then arranged in the order of the permutation and shifted along the ascii alphabet
the value of the key digit.
EX:
PLAINTEXT:
This is plaintext.
KEY:
2 5 1 4 6 3
CYPHERTEXT:
jVlwm_ qulo_g
you get the idea.  Im doing this from memory so i dont know the shifts of the _'s
Thanx

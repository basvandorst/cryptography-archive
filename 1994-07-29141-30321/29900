I agree, but I would also point out that there are no known secure
algorithms (true OTP excepted).  

Furthermore, it's a well accepted principle that the bits of the key
should be used in a complex interleaved order.  Multiple encryption
under different keys must use a less complex ordering than one would
choose if designing a secure cipher from scratch.  I expect the best
security/encryption effort ratio would come from a single
well-designed cipher, rather than the concatenation of several smaller
ciphers.

Many posters seem willing to trade a better key schedule for the
analysis already done on the popular ciphers (especially DES).
I think this is based on an undeserved confidence in the expertise
of the designers and analysts of those ciphers.

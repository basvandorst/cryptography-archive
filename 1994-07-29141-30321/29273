Thanks for posting the benchmarks. It's understandable that SHS is
faster - it uses a slightly faster cypher and you have used the
486-optimized version.

BTW, something that has not been mentioned yet - SFS works only on a
80386 or better. I don't rermember whether there are such limitations
on SecureDrive.

Also, I still have problems to use SFS under DR-DOS.

I'm not sure about this - I don't know any successful attacks neither
against IDEA, nor against the MDC-type cyphers. I'd say that SFS is at
least as secure as SecureDrive.

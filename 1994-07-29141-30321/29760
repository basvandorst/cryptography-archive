Summary: Pretty soon, I'll owe David a dinner
Lines: 9

As much as I hate to raise this subject, it looks as if I will soon
be losing a bet I made last year.  I bet that a description of the
encryption algorithm used in the Clipper chip would be posted to
Usenet before August 1st.  If it isn't, I have to buy a dinner for
David Sternlight the next time he comes to Portland.

Would someone please get busy and get that algorithm posted?

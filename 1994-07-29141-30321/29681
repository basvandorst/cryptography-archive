Matt Thomas <mcthomas@netcom.com> strengthened his cipher enormously
by transforming the key.  Without this precaution a glance at
the ciphertext will often reveal the key, even to someone who doesn't
want to know it!  With untransformed ASCII keys and ASCII
plaintext, all large blocks of plaintext spaces cause the ciphertext
to contain the key with case reversed.

For example, 12 spaces followed by 'The' encrypted with key 'SESAME'
gives ciphertext 'sesamesesame' followed by three more characters.

I agree that the cipher is weak. I want to emphasize the difference 
between ordinary weak ciphers and ones that allow
the 'one-glance-attack'.  The difference is much like shutting
an unlockable door and is important in its way.  BTW, posting the code
fragment made it clear just what algorithm was being discussed.
It's possible that Matt Thomas lengthened his key rather than
just transforming it, since he didn't post any subscripts or
indices although they may be what he meant. (?)

For what it's worth (not much), I'd be willing to spend some time to
help with the moderation effort; unfortunately, I don't have anywhere
near the knowledge, experience, or authoritative name that half the
people who post here do -- too bad we haven't got any volunteers from
the really sharp crowd...  Maybe if we all give them a big guilt trip? :-)

Unfortunately, US citizens probably can't email crypto code to the
moderator if the moderator is outside the US without running afoul
of the ITAR.  There's probably nothing that can be done about that,
regardless of where the moderator resides.  Or did I get that wrong?

You gave me a related idea which just might work, no matter what
country the moderator(s) happen(s) to live in.

If the moderator gets crypto code emailed to him (from outside
the US) which he can't post because of the ITAR, have him tell
the poster to post it himself with a special Approved: line, ala
alt.hackers.  [The moderator could make sure to forge a cancel
for anyone who posts silly drivel with a forged Approved: line.]  

Any comments, criticisms, suggestions?

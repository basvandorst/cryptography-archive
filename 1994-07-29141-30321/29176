I am currently testing hard drive encryption packages, particulary
SecureDrive 1.3D and SFS (Secure FileSystem) 1.0.  While producing
encrypted disks and testing the usability of the packages is not a
problem (thank goodness for optical drives), I am not qualified to
determine which encyrption is more "robust."

According to the documentation of the packages, SecureDrive uses a
128-bit IDEA cyper based on a MD5 hash of the users passphrase.  This
128-bit IDEA cyper is the basis of the conventional crypography that
PGP uses underneath its RSA, and should be quite strong.

SFS, on the other hand, uses a 512-bit key based on a "MDC/SHS"
cyper, and I have no idea what this is, despite the description
given in the documentation (I don't know enough crypto to understand
his explanation).

Also, SecureDrive comes with full source code, while SFS doesn't.
Should I trust SecureDrive more for that, or is the author of SFS
simply protecting his intellectual property?

Replies can either be made to this newgroup, or can be sent to
me via Email.

Thanks,

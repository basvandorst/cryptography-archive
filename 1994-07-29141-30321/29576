Um, what about uuencoded stuff?  I read statistics that show that
some pretty high percentages of the raw, uncensored bit stream are
uuencodings of alt.pictures.younameit.

If there is so much uuencoded stuff running around the net, how would
Big Brother know my uuencoded stuff was a GIF file, an EXE file or
how to build a bomb under DES encrypt, and then uuencoded for passing
around internet?  Remember, too, that for some folks' software, posting
to a moderated newsgroup is identical to sending normal mail.  I don't 
know if moderated groups have much uuencoded stuff, but it wouldn't
surprise me to find ones that do.

The question is not just "could we detect" it, but "how many false
hits and how many MB a day of false hits are there?"

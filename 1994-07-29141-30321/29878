Hey, I like this theory.  Selective disregard of the laws you don't like.
Think of the possibilities.  Hell, let's start big.  I don't like
the laws against murdering those I don't like I I'll just ignore them.
Hmm, who to take out first?  Democrats?  Yeah, that's the ticket.  And I
don't like the laws against stealing from those I don't like either.
I mean, it is so unjust that Sears has all those nice tools and I don't.
I despise Sears so I think I'll just drive over to the local Sears store
and load up a truck full of stuff.  And kill anyone who gets in my way,
of course.  I mean, it is terribly unjust that any scumbag who would
actually work for Sears is allowed to consume air.

What a wonderful idea!  I'm a big old fellow with lots of guns so under
this new legal theory I can have anything I want and I'll never have to 
work again.  Hey, is this a great country or what?

The above is such a total crap that I am not even going to argue with
it. It contains no valid points anyway.

Well, we have your word against his - according to the PGP docs, he
*does* have a trademark. Could somebody verify this? There should be
some publicly accessible records in the US trademark office or
whatever they are calling it there.

Bullshit. He wrote the program (the initial one, that is). He has the
right to do with it whatever pleases him. He can release it under the
GNU license and then sell it to another company. Depending on how you
get it, you can do with it what the respective license allows. If
you've got it under the GNU license, you can do with it what the GNU
license allows. I don't recall any part of it to allow trademark
infringements; maybe you can quote the part supporting your point of
view?

Instead of "marveling", you'd do better to think a little bit. Maybe
then you will notice that Phil protests not because his trademark is
infringed, but because his reputation is threatened. Besides, I see
nothing wrong in opposing an unfair patent and using the intellectual
property laws to protect your reputation.

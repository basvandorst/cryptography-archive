Look at it the other way:  the deterministic stuff is hopelessly 
contaminated with more random stuff like lightning strikes, reflections 
off of chaotic motion in the ionosphere, thermal noise from both 
terrestrial and extraterrestrial sources, etc.  Estimate the amount of 
real randomness involved, and hash the input down to that number of bits.

Not bad, but even that might be contaminated...  :-)

There is but one ACM.  It has chapters, SIGs, committees, etc.,
but the entity proper is only the ACM.  There is no such thing
as a U.S. Association for Computing Machinery.  Based on what
USACM means (it is spelled out clearly in the article that
heads this thread) I'd say that FACM would be the ACM's French
Public Policy Committee, etc.

Perhaps.  But not as severe a criticism as you have been advocating.

(I knew mech was studying intently, but had been lead to believe it was
a specific errr.. anatomy subject he was striving to understand.  Just
WAIT till she finds out it was all in the interest of science!...)

I just chatted with Stanton, & once he stops laughing, I gather he's
going to call Mitch & DEMAND a large raise. I'm not sure if a degree
from Universal Life Church, Graduate School of Netnews, & Storm Door
Company (tnx to Bob Newhart) qualifies, but I'll personally be sure to
call him Dr. Stanton from here on in.....

It sure is nice to know that UnProfessor verifies *all* his facts
before posting, isn't it?

I haven't looked at those, but regarding the one posted here a 
month ago, I've translated roughly two thirds of it into C.  I've 
been busy with other projects for the last couple of weeks but 
will post the translated version when it's done (if no one else 
has).  It's not particularly difficult, just a little tedious...

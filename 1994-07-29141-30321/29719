This fall I am teaching a course on coding theory and thought VCR Plus
codes would make an interesting example. Gemstar, the company that makes
these machines for programming VCRs, tells me that their coding system is
proprietary. Their engineeer I talked to did tell me that their is no
error-detection in the code.

Has anybody figured out the code? Thanks.

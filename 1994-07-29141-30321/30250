I read a post to comp.org.eff.talk a couple days ago stating that the feds have
come up with a way to impliment software based EES without using public key
crypto (posted by TC May). He said that Whit Diffie had attended a conference
in Europe on the subject and asserted that they presented the conceptual frame-
work of a system that would impliment software based EES without using PK
methods. The post mentioned something about negotiation with a remote host and
asserted that given the details of the system shown to the author that he 
believed that the system would actually be somewhat secure (secure from what
he didnt say). Unfortunatly he didnt mention any details so my qhestion is HOW --WHAT ARE THE DETAILS. Does anyone out there know more on this subject. 
Whitfield Diffie are you listening. Anyone else out there privy to the details?

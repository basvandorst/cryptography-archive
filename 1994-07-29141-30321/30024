OK, let's suppose we have a mostly-known plaintext attack, so we
immediately most of recover the Ci.  Let's focus attention on a single
block of length b.  We know the Ci are taken from a known pool of
randomish bits, with the same increment between each pair of Ci.  The
question is whether we can recover the offset and increment from
knowing part of the bits of Ci.

One approach would be to cycle over all of the increments and for each
one do a convolution between the known pattern and the random pool.  This
can be done by doing an FFT on both and multiplying them, then looking
for a peak.

I don't know how the time to do this would compare with the brute-force
search.  The FFT on the random pool need only be done once, and the
known patterns are probably fairly sparse so should be fast.

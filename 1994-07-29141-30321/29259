Given these ever-watchful secret police, it would probably be better to do
without requiring any one-time pads to be transmitted between Bob and
Alice. Here's how they can use any encryption method that is convenient for
them, such as PGP, as long as they don't include any headers or other such
things that would identify the encryption method to the secret police:

Alice wants to send Bob plaintext message P. She makes up a dummy message
D, such that P' = compress(P concatenated with D) is about the same length
as D. She makes it obvious where P ends and D starts. She then encrypts P'
to get C and sends that to Bob. Bob and Alice both then add K' = C XOR D to
a dummy one-time pad that they keep in case they have to give something to
the secret police later.

They get about half the data rate that way, which is the same as the
intertwining bits suggestion, but they don't have to make any implausible
claims about their encryption algorithm when they hand over their dummy
keys, unless you consider their claim that they did not bother to compress
their messages before encrypting as being too implausible.

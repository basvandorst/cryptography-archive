What if you use OTP, sending the two data streams over channels which are
deliberately kept seperate (or at least looking as if that's what you're
doing), with the innocuous message being the sum of the two data streams,
but with the real message being the IDEA-coded output of some orthagonal
function on the datastreams (difference div 2 would work okay).  For a
secure OTP, the two streams should both appear random (and they would).
The fact that this "random" was not generated by a true generator but was
instead the result of encryption would be quite impossible to prove unless
one had the IDEA key.

  Hello all.  I have a semi-limited knowlege of encryption, and a very 
limited knowlege of the internet.  I would like to know more about BOTH.. 
of course.  First off, is there a place on the internet where public keys 
for PGP are avalable?  An FTP?  And is there any sort of dictionary to 
cypher-jargon?  I am also interested in politics surounding the 
clipper/skipjack proposals, and im sure there are newsgroups dedicated to 
the subject, but i dont want to have to dig through all thousand 
something newsgroups my node subscribes to.  Could someone point me in 
the correct direction?  Thanks in advance...

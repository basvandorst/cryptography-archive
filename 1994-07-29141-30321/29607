Naah. Given your record of civility and decency in your posts here, it never
crossed my mind to read the lines as a cheap shot.

There's also a lesson in that for the rest of us. People who maintain
community standards of civility are almost always given the benefit of the
doubt, even by the unconscious minds of others.

The values that define our common-sense world are under assault. Some have
taken to extremes the spurious notion of freedom without responsibility, and
are trying to tear down moral guardrails. Those who live on the shoulders
are told by their pals that they are in the middle of the road. Nothing is
wrong any more (except, of course, conservative thoughts and expressions).

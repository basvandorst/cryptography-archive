Now, *this* I can easily agree with. Essentially, it says that
weakening the encryption by encrypting the same message twice with two
independently selected keys and strong cyphers is _highly unlikely_.
However, I understood your initial claim to mean that it is
_theoretically impossible_, which is what caused my comments. Sorry if
I have misunderstood you.

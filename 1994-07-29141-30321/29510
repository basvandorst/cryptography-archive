In the general case, I admit that I cannot know.  However, in practice, I
do know.  For example, my directions to a trader are not sensitive after
the trade is executed.  Very little data has a life measured in months or
years.  The classic exceptions appear in international espionage and
relate to "protecting sources."

Modern exceptions occur primarily in key management.  Even these yield to
modern management approaches.

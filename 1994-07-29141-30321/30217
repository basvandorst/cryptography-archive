I don't want to necessarily weigh in on the side of the NSA, but calling them
fascists and stormtroopers is out of line.  Sure, everyone here disputes their
right to regulate the free flow of cryptologic ideas by continuing to classify
them as munitions subject to export laws.  Sure, we are all for individual privacy
and don't trust the guarantees about how Clipper technology won't be abused.
But...in any national (them or us) conflict you better believe the NSA will be
one extremely valuable bunch of guys.  One thing I am stuck by over and over again
is how crucial cryptanalysis has been in military history.  A pale Englishman named
Alan Turing did as much as any single enlisted man to win the battle of the Atlantic
in WWII.  And what he and his colleagues accomplished was only possible through
massive (British) government funding and state-of-the-art equipment.  How many
lives did that investment ultimately save?  How many convoys successfully crossed
the Atlantic?

Rather than lobbing the usual salvos of abuse at the NSA, I'd like to see discussion
focus more on what Constitutional limits can be invoked to check potential
encroachments on the free exchange of cryptologic ideas, what ideas properly
fall under the "essential to national security" moniker, and how we can pursue the
topics of this forum without compromise of either personal or national integrity.

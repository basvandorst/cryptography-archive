It is easy to do lossy compression on an "original" with EVERY SINGLE 
ALGORITHIM AND EVERY SINGLE LEVEL OF LOSS AND RESCALEING.  This has got 
to be only about 10^6 different things at most.

Given that the original is there, you are screwed.  They just have to say 
"hey, isn't that the picture from ....." and they HAVE you, as they can 
alter it the same way you did, and notice that "you can't get there from 
here".

Possibly much more so, but not so much that I consider it to be "safe"

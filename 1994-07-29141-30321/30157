This has probably been talked to death in newsgroups outside of newton.misc, 
but *why* exactly can U.S. crypto software not be exported?  I find it hard to 
believe that the algorithms aren't out there for everyone to use.  Is it 
because the U.S. government doesn't believe that 'they' have competent 
programmers?  Or is this a completely stupid and arbitrary law?

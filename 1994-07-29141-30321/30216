   I know Rege and Andy (the authors of nCrypt) personally, and folks, they're 
on our side. They disagree with the laws as they stand. However, unlike many
here on the net, they don't wish to be the test case by defying the law.
All they ask is that you do not endanger them in the pursuit of your own
political agendas. If you wish to defy the law and become the test case that 
overturns it, fine. Rege, Andy and I will even make a modest contribution to 
your legal defense fund. But if you are going to violate the law, DO IT WITH
YOUR OWN SOFTWARE! DON'T MARTYR OTHERS FOR YOUR CAUSE.

   And remember Andy, Rege and I are in Canada -- The legal guarantees we
have for our freedoms here in our bill of rights are subject to restrictions
that are "reasonable in a democratic and free society" -- as intrepreted by
the Canadian courts. These guarantees of our rights are not nearly as absolute 
as the wording of the US constitution suggests they are in the USA.

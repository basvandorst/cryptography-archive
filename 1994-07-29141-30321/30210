Actually, I wasn't originally talking about ViaCrypt, but about
licensing public-key technology for digital cash applications.  The
license agreement for BSAFE says:

   RSA . . . grants the end-user . . . the right to use one copy of
   the RSA SOFTWARE to be used on a single terminal connected to a
   single computer. . . . The LICENSEE may not network any copy of the
   RSA SOFTWARE or otherwise use any copy on more than one computer.

RSA has made it clear that any use of their technology outside the
scope of this agreement must be explicitly sanctioned, and, of course,
paid for.

My two points were:

1) RSA (insofar as I can discern) has no explicit, uniform policy for
licensing their product to large commercial applications, and

2) it is possible that because of their partnership with CommerceNet,
they would be unwilling to license at all to a digital cash
application.

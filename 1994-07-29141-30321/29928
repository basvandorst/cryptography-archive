According to David Sternlight, Jim Bidzos' claims contradict RSADSI's
own FAQ.

Rubbish. PKP holds a patent only on the usage of RSA as a method for
secure communication. If somebody decides to use it for another
purpose - for instance, to learn fow to do multiple-precision
artihmetic - this does not require any licenses. The whole idea behind
the patents is that they are published and used by the people to learn
about the new idea.

Maybe that was just you. The author of HPACK has asked a free license
to use RSAREF in the US-version of his program and has been granted
one. Maybe Jim Bidzos just doesn't like you, after you have been
boring him so much. :-)

He can, but he didn't. Which implies that he, with his legal knowledge,
has considered the facts and the opportunities, and has decided that
he might not win.

Yup; the important is to present them with the two sides of the coin,
not only with Sternlight's.

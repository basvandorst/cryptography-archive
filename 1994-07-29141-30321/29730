I am sorry if my questions have been answered previously.  What is the
strength of the Khufu and Blowfish ciphers?  Are there any algorithms as
strong, or stronger than IDEA?

Also, what about using SHA to encrypt messages?  I've heard rumors that
this implementation could be very secure.

Finally, what else is available for the Mac besides PGP, Stego 1.2, and Curve
Encrypt?

Thank you for any replies.

   Hah -- I "invented" this scheme when I was 14. Almost every programmer
who knows nothing about cryptography "invents" this or a similar algorithm.
And we all think it secure until we spend about 5 minutes actually researching
cryptography -- at which point <smack> goes the hand against the forehead as
we realize how uninformed we were.

   The NSA is the body that eventually gives the yes/no decision
on export. In general, they will not approve of anything with an 
effective key length of over 40 bits, unless there is an obvious 
short-cut to cracking it (as is the case for WinCrypt).

   Yes, it's trivial to crack. It may not be possible to get the original
password, but it will not be at all difficult to determine the 512 character
block, and recover the plaintext.

>Any help in reducing my confusion would be appreciated.

   In general, any product approved for export is either trivial to crack, or 
has such a small keyspace that an exhaustive search for the key is easy. This 
is not surprising, when you consider that these are the very criteria upon which
they base their decision to allow export.

   I would not use any such product to protect data that I didn't wish read. 
PGP or RIPEM are examples of secure cryptographic utilities.

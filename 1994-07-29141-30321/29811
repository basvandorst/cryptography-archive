Don't take this the wrong way, Mr. Rollins, but what you did really
pisses me off.
 
I'm not an expert in cryptography, but I've come to know the reputation
of a program called PGP.  I have discussions with my friends about its
security, compatibility, etc.  And the idea that you have created a
different product and distributed it under the same name is extremely
irritating.
 
Shenanigans of this kind are a big part of the reason some users never
use shareware -- because they can't rely on its origins and sources.
Someone is always hacking in an "improvement" that alters the power
and interoperability.
 
I am not a lawyer and I have no idea whether you were within your legal
rights.  But I feel I am indebted to Mr. Zimmerman, who created a
powerful program and made it available free.  Now, I know how I feel
about your unsolicited modification, and apparently Mr. Zimmerman
agrees.
 
Nothing is so good that it can't be improved.  But please call the
different product, be it better or not, by a different name so that
those of us who are merely users rather than experts can tell
what is going on.
 
Dave

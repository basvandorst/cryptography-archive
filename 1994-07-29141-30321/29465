: Of course, this doesn't necessarily strengthen the prosecution's case, 
: but it definitely weakens the defense, so why use it if it's not necessary?
: Which brings me back to my original question: is there a more 
: sophisticated set of methods that will allow you to encrypt an 
: incriminating message using one algorithm, but allows you to use an 
: entirely different algorithm to decrypt it into an innocuous message of 
: your choosing?

	Maybe I'm missing the point here, but why not use a OTP approach 
with a Vigenere Table or a piece of simple software that duplicates that. 
Instead of a "real" OTP, you can use the date to correspond to a 
page/line of a common book found in your home and that line(s) are the 
code key. With a 5 grouping of letters you can change the key to come out 
to anything you want it to say and the bad guys will never know if they 
got the right message or not...
	Its a thought.....

Having ftp'd the postscript version of this document directly from the 
host system, the title page reads as follows:

"Codes, Keys and Conflicts:
   Issues in U.S. Crypto Policy
--------------------------------
Report of a Special Panel of the ACM U.S.
Public Policy Committee (USACM) June 1994
. . .
by --- (list of authors)
. . .
Association for Computing Machinery, Inc."

On page iv (Preface):
"... USACM was created by ACM to provide a means for presenting and 
discussing technological issues to and with U.S. policy makers and the 
general public. Presentation of this information includes white papers, 
news releases, journal articles, and expert testimony for Congressional 
hearings. This report is the first major undertaking of USACM."

On page v (Acknowledgements)
"This report is the idea of Dr. Barbara Simons, chair of USACM. Within 
days of the White House announcement of the Escrowed Encryption 
Initiative, Dr. Simons conceived of this panel, and it was she who
arranged a chair and initial funding from ACM. This report would not 
have occurred without her efforts.
  This report benefitted from the review by members of USACM and the 
ACM Committee on Computers and Public Policy. We greatly appreciate 
their help."
       ======================================================
That is directly from the document, which is available via:
  ftp://info.acm.org/reports/acm_crypto_study/
  gopher://gopher.acm.org/11(the_files.reports.acm_crypto_study)
       ======================================================

Personally, I feel that USACM is very inappropriate choice of acronym 
for this committee, since it infers NOTHING about being a committee of 
the ACM nor a Public Policy Committee of ACM - and as such, I must agree 
that it is very deceptive.

But that is a choice ACM and Dr. Simons must have made. We wont change 
it by wasting bandwidth here. Members of ACM who agree should take it 
up with their directorate.

I do hope we can stop wasting download time on this matter now.

You didn't actually tell us which newsreader you use.

On the off-chance that you use trn, here's my recommendation:

/strnlght@netcom\.com/f:,
/strnlght/Hreferences:,

This'll kill followups to his posting as well as the postings
themselves.

If that doesn't get everything, you could add:

/strnlght/a:j
/Sternlight/a:j

but it'll be much slower.  So far I've found it unnecessary.

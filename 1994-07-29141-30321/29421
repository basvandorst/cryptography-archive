   Weird though it may seem.  If you take your laptop (with say PGP
2.6 installed) to Europe--and bring it back--you should not be
considered in violation of ITAR in accordance with current
interpretations.  But I don't advise this, if only because you should
keep your copy of PGP on a write protected floppy with your secret
keyring.  (Also, if you never took PGP out of the country, you can't
be suspected of making illegal copies and selling them...)

   I believe that taking a copy of your secret keyring with you is
okay, but only if you don't intend to give it away.  (I didn't write
ITAR, believe me, I didn't.)  However taking encrypted messages with
you may be considered illegal!

   Amen!

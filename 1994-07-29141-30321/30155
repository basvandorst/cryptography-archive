As per FIPS PUB 46-2:

8.   Implementations. Cryptographic modules which implement this
standard shall conform to the requirements of FIPS 140-1.  The
algorithm specified in this standard may be implemented in
software, firmware, hardware, or any combination thereof.  The
specific implementation may depend on several factors such as the
application, the environment, the technology used, etc.
Implementations which may comply with this standard include
electronic devices (e.g., VLSI chip packages), micro-processors
using Read Only Memory (ROM), Programmable Read Only Memory
(PROM), or Electronically Erasable Read Only Memory (EEROM), and
mainframe computers using Random Access Memory (RAM).  When
the algorithm is implemented in software or firmware, the
processor on which the algorithm runs must be specified as part
of the validation process.  Implementations of the algorithm
which are tested and validated by NIST will be considered as
complying with the standard.  Note that FIPS 140-1 places
additional requirements on cryptographic modules for
Government use.  Information about devices that have been
validated and procedures for testing and validating equipment for
conformance with this standard and FIPS 140-1 are available from
the National Institute of Standards and Technology, Computer
Systems Laboratory, Gaithersburg, MD 20899.

(The latest version 46-2 gives permission for software implementations,
 while 46-1 says: "...using hardware (not software)". )

Anyone familiar with a UN sponsored consortium of cryptographers that is
developing ! Uiversal Image Coding! (UIC) techniques for the unique
identification of images? I Haven!t been able to find any mention of
through my searches of gopherspace to date. Supposedly it their efforts
are based on some work done by Livermore Labs>  According to Bart Nagel
of Mondo 2000 magazine there is supposedly federal legeslation being
proposed that would mandate the inclusion of UIC chips in every scanning
device made or imported into the US and that is being lobbied for by a
group called the International Union of Media Camera Operators IUMCO and
by another group called ImageFare. Any info about lists, newsgroups,
webservers, that moght refer to this topic would be appreciated.

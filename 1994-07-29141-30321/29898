The randomness could be a problem.  This may have been answered
already, but I'll ask anyway.

A program like Stego, as I understand, hides ciphertext in the least
significant bit of digitized pixel values.  Well-encrypted ciphertext should
be indistinguishable from random bits.  Will statistical tests on the
bits distinguish between good ciphertext and low-order bits from graphic
images ?  Does stego have some way to guard against this ?

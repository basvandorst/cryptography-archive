Fellow netters,
	I am trying to find some information about any encryption algorithms 
or other relevant literature available regards to encryption of video data.
I have looked at various FAQs, but there does not seem to be too much
information on this topic.  

	I am specifically looking at the MPEG video compression format
and  its possible encryption, and any relevant information would be greatly
appreciated.

Thankyou in advance, and here is looking forward to hearing from you.

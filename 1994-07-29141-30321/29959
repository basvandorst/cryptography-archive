It is being distributed free of chargei. 

You might remember Matt is the person who recently discovered and 
publicised a protocol failure in the EES. 

He has done us all a great service, both by releasing CFS and by 
exposing flaws in the EES.

You get full source code with the CFS distribution. It doesn't even 
include binaries. There are no key escrow features. If you want to 
use a different cipher, you are free to patch one in (triple DES is 
included, but if you'd prefer something like IDEA, and you aren't 
afraid to muck around in the source, you can substitute a different 
block cipher - I've personally patched in Eric Young's very fast DES
code for the sake of a performance improvement).

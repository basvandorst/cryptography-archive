Is there an easy way to embed the ciphertext so that the plaintext does
not look obviously stilted ?

I'd imagine that the lower the density of cyphertext in the plaintext,
the more natural the plaintext can be made to look (e.g. treat every
sentence containing 'the' as a 1 bit and those without as a 0 bit).

But is there a simple, optimal rule that provides a reasonable density
of cyphertext within natural-looking plaintext, that does not take 
forever to compose ?

Thanks,

Wait a minute.  Just who is "elitist"?  Who has "delusions of grandeur"?

But you're *not* a member, so you have no standing to so "demand" anything
of the ACM, and (if I may be so bold) some might consider it arrogance for
you to even suggest such a thing.  Certainly you are treading on shaky
ground to use libellous words like "misrepresenting the matter."

Actually, an *expert* committee, which makes it even more persuasive.  
But perhaps one has to *really* hold a faculty appointment at UCLA to tell 
the difference.  And I recall nothing in the press release that suggested 
the committee misrepresented its status.

Your "vested interest" is clear, but it's not in the processes of the 
ACM.  Had you been concerned about preserving your alleged plank-owner 
status in ACM, you should have maintained your membership.  On the 
"vested interest' issue, you have every appearance of being a spook, and 
consistently post as though *that* is your vested interest.

Hmmm.  Who appointed you the guardian of the "moral guardrails" ?

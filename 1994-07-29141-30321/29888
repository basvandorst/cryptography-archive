You can't update the scsi drivers unless you have previously shown you know
the password by unlocking the disk. If you walk away from your machine
leaving the disk unlocked, that's your problem, not that of the software.
But you can't update the drivers if your disk is hardware-nonexistent to any
machine, as it is when locked.

You can also remove the DiskLock protection if you know the password. So
what?

As it happens, among Mac experts, DiskLock is considered to be the most
solid and robust disk protection there is.

The values that define our common-sense world are under assault. Some have
taken to extremes the spurious notion of freedom without responsibility, and
are trying to tear down moral guardrails. Those who live on the shoulders
are told by their pals that they are in the middle of the road. Nothing is
wrong any more (except, of course, conservative thoughts and expressions).

(I posted a similar message to this one yesterday from another system,
but that is having problems with news.  Apologies when that message appears.)

Isn't it the case that if we can find random elements with short cycles,
we can factor n?  A short cycle has a 50-50 chance of revealing two dif-
ferent square roots of a number (the one which preceded the cycle, and the
one which looped back) which lets us factor n.  So short cycles aren't a
problem?

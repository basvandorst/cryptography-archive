Wow, am I afraid of the NSA.  I am one of those guys close to the PGP subpoenas
that were passed around -- what -- almost a year ago now?

Well of course one big difference between video cipher devices and PGP is that
it is really hard to put video cipher devices into a self-decrypting-file that
is indistinguishable from random noise. Is it illegal to export a high density
floppy filled with random noise? Nope.

Is it illegal to e-mail two megabyte blocks of random noise overseas? Nope.

I urge people on the net to export random data frequently (not of course to
fool customs into thinking you are doing something illegal and thus creating
fear, uncertainty, and doubt in *their* minds.)

Why do I think that if the administration can't stop cocaine, money, liquor,
and cigarettes from crossing our borders that it will be able to with a
thing that is within epsilon of masslessness and can be infinitely cloned using
an epsilon of energy and effort?

Sternlight basks in the afterglow of imagining himself whipped bloody by a 
leather 'n latex NSA dominator, but he forgets that the rest of us
always have a 'safe word' which is, of course, the word pee-gee-pee.

   Your tests were undoubtedly better than mine.  I did only very tentative
digram/trigram "analysis", since I did it all by hand; I didn't want to
sit and make tables all day, so I just made notes on a few things I
noticed along the way.  No contact analysis.  Not a good analysis at all.

   I also noticed ZPMZN and the interesting patterns WMPI, WPIM and WMPM.

   I suspected rot13 for a bit because of frequency counts, and never
thought to just hit ^X in the newsreader.  (I don't really suspect it
any more, with interesting patterns like JZCT, JCTZ and JZVZ.  :-)

   Thanks for the thoughts...

   I guess I don't see the value in more than one level of duress codes
("giveaway messages".)  If you're seriously under duress, and you give
up your giveaway key, you may be okay.  But if you give away 2 keys, how
can you prove to the person who's extracting information from you that
you've given him the *last* key?
 
   Bruno slaps you around a bit, and you give him the bad poetry password.
He doesn't believe that's it, so he breaks a couple of ribs.  You give him
the slightly-incriminating recipie for marijuana brownies.  He now knows
that there is more than one password.  So he breaks your arm.  Now, you
tell him the password that yields the really good stuff--illegal contracts,
lists of names of your subversive group, etc. Is there any reason at all
for him not to believe that there are a couple more levels?  After he's
killed you, he may still have lingering doubts about whether, had he been
a little more careful, you would have finally broken and given him the
next password.
 
   This is a real-world-use problem.  If you expect civilized opponents,
maybe n levels will work--or maybe you'll rot in a jail cell for contempt
because the feds have told the judge they're just sure that there's one
more level.

I don't think USACM is the abbreviation for the committee. A normal
interpretation of that abbreviation is the U.S. Association for Computing
Machinery--doubtless there is an FACM (French--more likely AMCF or some
such), and a UKACM or BACM, etc.

If USACM IS the name of the special subcommittee, that is itself
misleading and subject to criticism.

The values that define our common-sense world are under assault. Some have
taken to extremes the spurious notion of freedom without responsibility, and
are trying to tear down moral guardrails. Those who live on the shoulders
are told by their pals that they are in the middle of the road. Nothing is
wrong any more (except, of course, conservative thoughts and expressions).

How did you reach this conclusion? Even in the original PGP
documentation he says that PKP claims to have a patent on the method
used by PGP, and US users of PGP should probably obtain a license. He
also describes his own attempts to obtain such a (free) license and
how he has been denied it. Obviously, now he has succeeded. This does
not tell us anything about him changing his mind regarding the
validity of the patent, and even does not tell us anything about the
validity of the patent per se. The only thing it tells us is that PKP
claims to have a ridiculously broad patent and that Phil has finally
succeeded to make them issue a free license for the users of PGP.

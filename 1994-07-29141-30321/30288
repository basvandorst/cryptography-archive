Ridiculous.  One could not possibly defend against a charge
of illegal arms export on the grounds that is was protected by
the first amendment.  Illegal arms trafficking is not protected
free speech anymore than illegal drug trafficking is.

Not really.   To most Americans, such a prosecution would simply
be evidence that the government is doing its job.

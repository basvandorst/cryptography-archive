It's my understanding (and please correct me if I'm wrong) that RSADSI claims
its patent applies to eliptical/polynomial derivatives of RSA.

If for some reason you HAD to use a public key system for encryption
I would suggest probabilistic encryption using a Blum Blum Shub Pseudorandom
generator as mentioned in applied cryptography. Its faster. Its possible
to do most of the calculation ahead of time in large netwroked situations
(like a digital cash syetem) without losing security so this makes it REALLY
fast.

It depends on the hardness of factoring the product of two large primes as
does RSA so its as secure theoretically, but short messages encoded with it
are not suceptible to attack as they are in RSA encoded plaintext messages.

The big negative is that you can't sign things with it.

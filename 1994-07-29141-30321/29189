        Each RSA key in secring.pgp is encrypted using a passphrase
        you supply to create the encrypting IDEA key. It is of no use
        to anyone but you. If you have used strong passphrases, there
        is no practical way someone else can extract any private keys.

        Cheers,
                Marc

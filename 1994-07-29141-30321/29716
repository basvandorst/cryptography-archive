Wrangling about Mr Zimmermann's property rights when we all saw how he
treated RSA Data Security's property rights is enough to make a PGP user
cynical. Except that for more than a year now PGP has grown beyond its
originator and everybody knows it.
Mr Zimmermann is now irrelevant; he can grub for
money and recognition just like the rest of us.

Whatever he does no longer affects the principle of freedom behind PGP
or GPG or PIG or whatever you want to call it.

Thank you, Phil.  Now step aside.

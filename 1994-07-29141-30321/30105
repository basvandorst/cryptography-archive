    There is a detail that many people seem to be missing.  The MIT
versions of PGP are legal since MIT is one of the patent holders.
Through Public Key Partners (in conjunction with Stanford), they
licensed the RSA patent (and others) to RSA Incorporated to exploit
commercially.

     So the ViaCrypt version is licensed, for a fee, from RSA, Inc.,
while the MIT version bypasses RSA, Inc. entirely.

     By the way, I am not sure what the arrangement between PKP and
RSA Inc. is.  I suspect that RSA Inc. has the exclusive right to
commericially license RSA.  If that is the case, MIT can use RSA or
give it away, but can't sell it.

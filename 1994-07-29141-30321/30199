In article The Cambridge Algorithms Workshop (Dr. Dobb's Journal, APRIL 1994) writes:

	'Massey and Maurer proved that a cascade of multiple algorithms is
	 at least as strong as the first or, with stream ciphers, at least
	 as strong as the first or, with stream ciphers, at least as strong
	 as the best (see "Cascade Ciphers: The Importance of Being First" by
	 Maurer and Massey, Journal of Cryptology, 1993). The difficulty with
	 proving anything more than this is that a bad guy might provide you
	 with a first algorithm which twisted your plaintext around so as to
	 provide a chosen-plaintext attack on the second algorithm which you
 	 supplied.'

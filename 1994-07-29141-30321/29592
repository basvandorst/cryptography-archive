I am currently playing around breaking trivial ciphers that are often offered
as part of libraries for programmers. Currently I am at work on a system and I
need some hints otherwise I might reinvent the wheel....

I have a lib that provides me with a crypt(cleartext,keystring) and 
according to my investigations does the following: it computes a "randomized" 
series of bytes only depending on the key and the length of the key (i.e.
the key "AA" and the key "AAAA" result in different ciphertexts. This 
"randomized" series is then XORed with the plaintext. 

Do I now need to find out how this pseudorandom stuff is generated or does
anybody know of other trivial methods to crack this (like the coincidence-
factors for more trivial encryption which is very successful...)

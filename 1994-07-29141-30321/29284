Furthermore, everybody reading this group must realize that there has been
one successful prosecution for export of cryptographic devices.  This was
the US vs Vallodares and Martinez, tried in Judge Hoeveller's court in
Miami.  The cryptographic devices were TV satellite receivers exported
to Mexico.  The defendents were totally unaware that export of crypto
without a license is illegal.

David Kahn, Cipher Deavours, and George Davida were expert witnesses for
the defense, but to no avail.  Vallodares served a one year and one day
sentence after conviction, and Martinez six months in a work house.

So far as I know, this is the only case of crypto export that has come
to trial.  I was told that the counsel for NSA attended the trial and
took plenty of notes.

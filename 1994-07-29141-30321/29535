This is the problem - one of the reasons IDEA has no known
attacks is because it is relatively new.  This is not a good
foundation to base your security on.

This is what I mean by IDEA being relatively new - DES is 15
years old and has been under intense attack for most of its life
- only recently have attacks been found that are more efficient
than brute force.  This tells me that DES is a very strong and
well designed cipher.  I realise that it is likely that some new
attack will, one day, demolish DES, but this is true of IDEA
too.  IDEA is only a few years old and hasn't had any where near
the amount of scrutiny DES has - IMHO IDEA holds great promise
but has yet to prove itself.

At least when one uses DES you *know* how someone will likely
attack your system, and you can estimate your security
accordingly.

There is a point to be made for using new ciphers however, even
if unproven by years of attack - if everyone used DES because we
just *knew* it was so good we'd be in for a nasty shock one day :)

But how do you know that the algorithms your are using one after
another are not interacting to create a hole?  Unlikely as hell,
but if your sequence of algorithms isn't subjected to public
scrutiny, if such a hole exists the only people to find it will
be your opponents.

Obscurity is usually what we try to avoid.  If the NSA can crack
any given DES data stream, then "a little obscurity" is most
certainly *not* going to stand it in its way.  "serious hacking"
simply does not compare in difficulty to anything requiring 2^56
operations.

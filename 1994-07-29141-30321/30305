The First Amendment does not give you an untramelled right to say anything
at all.  When Aaron Burr was charged with treason, the crime was passing
information verbally and in writing.  Similarly when the Rosenbergs were
executed for espionage, they were executed for the same thing: passing
information.  There are various Supreme Court decisions, such as the one
referring to shouting 'fire!' in a crowded theater, that express the same
notion.  So, if you are seriously saying that you have a First Amendment
right to say anything you like, you are quite wrong.

If you are arguing at a more practical level, then you may or may not be
right.	What the public will approve of varies from time to time.  I do
not believe that there was any great outcry against the execution of the
Rosenbergs; the liberal press protested, but the people did not demonstrate.
Similarly, when the FBI raids a BSS and seizes everything in sight, the
man on the street is very likely to approve.  You may not like it, but
that's democracy.  The people at large tend to be much more right wing than
college students.

I would not want to be the one to be caught exporting cryptographic
technology by some Federal prosecutor up for a promotion or some small
town DA seeking reelection, especially one with a flair for publicity.

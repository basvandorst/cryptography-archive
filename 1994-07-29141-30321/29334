I'm confused. Of what practical value is this as a threat? That you can send
a gibberish message that is the product of two real messages, and add a
valid signature to it seems, at most, a minor nuisance--that is, it would
mean people would receive a gibberish message that was signed.

The likelihood that somehow you could get or trick someone into producing
two signed messages whose product made for anything damaging, if signed,
seems to me to be miniscule.

Or is there something I don't understand?

The values that define our common-sense world are under assault. Some have
taken to extremes the spurious notion of freedom without responsibility, and
are trying to tear down moral guardrails. Those who live on the shoulders
are told by their pals that they are in the middle of the road. Nothing is
wrong any more (except, of course, conservative thoughts and expressions).

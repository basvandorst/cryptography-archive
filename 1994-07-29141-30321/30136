Uhm, is it just me, or have others also noticed that replacing
"McCandlish" with "Sternlight" in the above text converts it to a

And a pretty good idea, too... Just imagine, a newsgroup free of
Sternlight's drivel and the flames that it causes!

Except your own, huh?

Obviously, you have been the only one.

Except one.

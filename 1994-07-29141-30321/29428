Joesph,

	1. I don't know if this is the latest, but my copy was $44.95 so
	   even if it isn't you're getting quite a bargain over list price.
	2. The errata file gets posted here fairly regularly, plus the
	   disk comes with "a file containing corrections for any
	   mistakes found in the book..."
	3. You send $30.00 to:
		Bruce Schneier
		Counterpane Systems
		730 Fair Oaks Avenue
		Oak Park, IL 60302
	   Or $90.00 for a two year subscription.

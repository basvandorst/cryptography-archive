Well, clearly, sequential application of known crypto techniques could 
not possibly WEAKEN the protection unless you used the same or similar
keys each time, but randomly chosen keys could not possibly weaken
it. If this were the case, could the NSA make breaking into your data
easier by encrypting it a few times before they decrypt it?

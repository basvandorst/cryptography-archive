"Comrade: I am, of course, most pleased to comply with your directives. 
But surely you must understand that great care was taken to ensure the highest 
quality recordings possible. I fear your filter will degrade our recordings 
below RF broadcast quality. We will have little choice but to continue 
communicating covertly this way. Please reconsider your position."

Intuition says there has to be something wrong with an encryption system that 
allows a third party to change a message's content and re-send it.

Am I to understand that legislation will prevent us from encrypting messages 
upstream of Clipper?

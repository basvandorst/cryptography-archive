   I see a technical problem with the scheme Bryan Olsen has described:
 
   Each level higher you go, you're able to account for more of the disk
drive's space.  At the top level, there must be some space remaining that
you can't account for--because otherwise, you'd be able to prove you're
at the top level.  This means that you're going to have to pre-allocate
some disk space for junk.  How much?  It can't be a constant amount, so
you'll have to generate an amount somewhat randomly--but not too much of
the disk space, or the system becomes impractical to use.  If the real
data is any significant fraction of the total disk data, then this system
is going to "leak" some information--if you have almost no space that
you can account for, you're probably still at a low level.  If you have
more than half the usable disk space accounted for, you're probably at
a higher level.
 
   This means that the vast majority of your disk space will have to be
filled with random data, or it will leak information.

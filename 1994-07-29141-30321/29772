	Any statement is worthless without knowing its source. Any
	responsible person does not take ungrounded rumour seriously.

	This was part of the problem with ULTRA Intelligence during
	the war. They had good information to pass onto the Navy
	but they didn't want to tell them where this good information
	came from.  Initially, this information was largely ignored,
	because	no credible source was credited to it.

	I personally, place more value on the same given statement
	from one person, and no value whatsoever from another.  The source
	is important.  If someone hands me an anonymous note, it goes
	into the garbage.  If they don't have the guts to put their
	name to it, then I cannot assess its value.  It thus gets
	classified as garbage/hoax.

	There are probably a few exceptions, like "you've been made
	a target" where I'll take an anonymous tip seriously.  But
	fortunately, I've never encountered personally this situation
	to date  ;-)

	Don't be a wimp. Put your name to it, or confine your postings
	to the fetish groups.

I can not here any real difference in the sound afterwards, and it makes it hard for people to tell if you have encrypted data on your machine.

Nathan was kind enough to send me a copy (Thanks, Nathan!) - I have since
tried it on a number of high-quality (22KHz) digitized Mac sounds, and
can't detect any audible difference. In addition, having run the 'stego'd'
sounds through several Mac sound-editing programs and having been unable to
_see_ any difference, all I can say is: 

               Well Done, Nathan!

I'll leave it to older and wiser heads to determine whether or not the
encryption algorithm is secure. However, as far as I can tell, the
steganographic method is sufficient to mislead all but the most
well-informed snoop.

I have one test yet to do  -  We'll see if a 44KHz sound pulled off an
audio CD, run through Nathan's program, and piped through decent speakers
suffers any audible degradation.

For general cryptographic applications, this approach is often viable;
unfortunately, digital cash does require a public-key algorithm.

The catch here is that RSADSI doesn't really care about how many
copies of their actual software you're using.  They hit you up for
whatever they think they can get out of you by indexing their prices
in some extremely vague way to the "magnitude" of your system.

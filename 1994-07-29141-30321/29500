   I strongly support the formation of a moderated group on cryptography,
   called something like sci.crypt.research.

Seventy-thirded!  Ok, so I exaggerate -- it's probably closer to
fifteenthed.  I also favour sci.crypt.research for its name.

   I don't even care very much who moderates it, as long as it isn't me.

What a vote of confidence!  (Only joking, Bruce)


In the dim and distant past, I offered my services as a non-US
co-moderator if no-one more suitable could be found.  That offer, with
the same disclaimer, still stands.  I've never moderated a newsgroup
before, but I'm sure I can pick it up as I go along.

Now, who volunteered to do all the work in getting this proposal moved
to a vote?

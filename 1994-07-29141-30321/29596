As others have already noted, they don't.  The "distribution" header
is useless for this purpose (as I recently discovered when I tried to
post a message announcing an ftp site to distribution "uk").

It is of course quite legal to export *algorithms* from the US, for
example in the form of books.  Can anyone cast light on exactly where
the boundary lies?  Suppose you post an algorithm described in English,
but in a restricted enough subset of English that an interpreter could
execute it.  An even more amusing example would be a program that
could interpret the patent for, say, RSA.

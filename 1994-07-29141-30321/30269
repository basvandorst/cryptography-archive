Well first of all, I don't believe that the government would even dream of
prosecuting somebody for distributing cryptography over the net. I intend
to test this soon if I am not beaten to it. Any attempt at prosecution would
provide enough negative publicity to sink any Gorewelian cryptographic
policy that might be in the making.

Second of all, they would not try to prosecute those who made the program,
only those who distributed it. If the program gets into foreign hands,
SOMEBODY has to have given it to them. Potential subjects for prosecution
include the person who uploaded it, the person who runs the site to which
it was uploaded, and the person who runs the last US site that the program
goes through. Once upon a time BITNET was told that all US sites are
responsible for any cryptography that goes through them. As you can see its
a silly law, like Massachusetts blue laws. The government doesn't have the
guts to arest anybody here for blasphemy and the government doesn't have
the guts to arrest anybody for distributing cryptography over the net.
Both would violate the bill of rights and both would result in enourmous
amounts of bad publicity.

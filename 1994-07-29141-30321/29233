Bruce Schneier's "Applied Cryptography" is the best way to start, I

Yes, a FAQ gets posted here every few weeks. Also available by ftp at
the MIT site, also mentioned here frequently. And various URLs and
gopher sites have it available.

Best that you just keep reading this group. It will arive soon.

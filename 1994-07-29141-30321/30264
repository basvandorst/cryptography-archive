Oops, you're right; slipped a cog there.  This was a running-key
cipher I posted.  Sorry about that.

A well-worked book cipher should be much tougher than a running-key
cipher.  But as shown in Kahn (p. 372), it is not uncommon for
sloppy use of the cipher to render it crackable.  (The example
cited showed how W. Friedman cracked one without even figuring
out what the original book was.)

For what it's worth ... I wrote a program that requires a
key to run.  The key is stored on the disk, but in encrypted
form.  When someone enters what they think is the key, their
entry gets encrypted, and the results is compared with the
real encrypted key.  If the comparisson is good, everything
works.  At no time is the clear form of the key available.

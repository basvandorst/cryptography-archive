     Don't worry about /that/ too much, you should see the code for the 
DES cipher! ;) (Which is why I decided to try and compile IDEA).  Thanks 
for including a sample <usuals.h> file, but I have already been pointed to a 
FTP site where I got the IDEA code which (Finally) compiled. 
     Thanks for all the help from everybody, and if anybody would like 
the source I picked up, (Called idea.V1.1.tar) e-mail me for the FTP site 
and login/password.

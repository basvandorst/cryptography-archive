3: the spoofer just did a simple "decrypt Bob's reply and reencrypt
in the Bob-pseudo-key before propigating the message to Alice."

I fail to see how your proposed protocol avoids the central issue
in PK spoofing.



But (quoting out of order WRT the above):

Suitable timing constraints, and in particular real-time constraints,
can be used to hinder, and perhaps defeat, spoofing attacks.  But
with a store-and-forward e-mail system (such as PGP is designed to
work with) these constraints cannot, in general, be set.

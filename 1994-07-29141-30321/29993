Wanna bet you're another alt.fan.big-brother apologist?  Why the 
hypocrisy, Tom?  The subject is ENCRYPTION.  So what's wrong with 
having an "encrypted identity" to keep nosey people without a 
valid need-to-know from knowing what they don't need to know? 
What is there about YOUR post that would *PROVE* who you are? 
Posting anonymously, while it withholds a person's identity, at 
least discloses that fact to all concerned.

BTW, I'm *not* the person who posted the original message.  Any 
I-need-to-know-all-about-you voyeur deserves to be responded to 
anonymously, however.  Very few hypocrites with the attitude "if 
I can't verify your existence then you must not exist" are 
willing to publicly post meaningful data, like their full name, 
birthdate, driver's license number, social security number, place 
of birth, etc. in order to allow *THEIR* identity to be verified. 
FYI, it's only the real net.newbies who naively believe that a 
"real" name in an email return address proves ANYTHING.

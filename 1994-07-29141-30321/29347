R4->R4 PASSWORD <oldpassword> <newpassword>

It would take exactly 15 seconds to code into command.c on the Vanilla
server.

RSA is a poison, too damn many people think it's god's gift.  Anything
involving RSA is 100% safe.  It's not.

There is no need to use RSA here, it does not help in any way over the
original encryption scheme.  As Andy pointed out, if the client does
the encryption, joe twink just has to grab the packets and steal the
encrypted string directly from the packet.  Echoing this encrypted
scheme then verifies that I am indeed MUCUS PIG.

A truly secure password system:
Server generates random number and passes to client.
Client get user password, string adds the random number to it
using newline as a seperator (newlines aren't in passwords).
Client encrypts the results using a server public key and sends
it to the server.  (Thus communication is "secure").
Server decrypts the password using it's private key, compares 
the trailing number with the number it had generated.
Then crypt(3)s the password to compare to the server password
database.

Note, doing the crypt(3) on the client side would not improve the
security of the situation in anyway, since the client could be written
to echo the encrypted string rather than the password, as Andy pointed
out.

The real kicker:  it doesn't matter!  It's not like we have any
problems with passwords right now.  I seem to recall hearing about
one guy who had his stats reset, but other than that, what could
happen?

Anyone who really knows about this stuff have comments?

I run a Netrek WWW site, something like the following command should connect:
%mosaic http://obsidian.math.arizona.edu:8080/netrek.html
For NCSA Mosaic binaries: ftp ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu:/Web/
For text terminals, get Lynx: ftp ftp2.cc.ukans.edu:/pub/WWW/lynx/

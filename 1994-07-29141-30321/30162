I've suspected that the solution of transposition ciphers could be 
automated, at least for the complete columnar.  There aren't that many
schemes for laying in the text and taking it out, about 40 in all I
think.

My CRYPT program doesn't attempt auto solving but it does implement
the primitive routes: in by columns, out by rows; in by spiral, out by
some other route; and so on.

My guess is that by using digraphic statistics, and "skip" statistics,
solutions could be automated.  By "skip" statistics I mean the frequency
of X_Y.  

Incomplete columnars are a much tougher story.  I remember an article
by Deavours in _Cryptologia_ that uses statistics to help solve them,
but I don't remember the details.

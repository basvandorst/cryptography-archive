   My understanding is that there is a theorem, usually attributed to
A. Yao's preliminary report ``Theory of Trapdoor Functions,'' which
does this:

   a set of possible PRNG outputs (that is all possible outputs for
all possible seeds) satisfies the next bit condition if no fast algorithm
can look at the first k bits and guess the (k+1)-st bit with probability
much bigger than 1/2.  I repeat that we are asking about the behavior
of the algorithm as we look at all possible PRNG outputs, not just
what happens for one particular output.

   a set of all possible PRNG outputs satisfies the efficient tests
condition, if, for every efficiently computable algorithm A which took
as input a sequence of bits and gave as output a number, the average of
A(s) over all prng outputs s is close to the average of A(s) over all s.

   Yao's Theorem:  a prng that satisfies the next bit  condition satisfies
the efficient tests condition.

   I'm pretty sure any prng that had too many small cycles would violate
the efficient tests condition.  My guess is BBS wanted part of their
paper to not depend on QRA.

   Yao's theorem is discussed in Kranakis' PRIMALITY AND CRYPTOGRAPHY
and in my notes on cryptography.

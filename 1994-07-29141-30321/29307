I had never heard of USACM before this release.  However, I was certainly
not of the opinion that it represented the ACM as a whole until I read
_your postings_ on this topic.  Then I was confused about it (as my earlier
posting today shows).

At best, I now assume, that if it speaks for the ACM, it is
because the ACM asked it to.  If it speaks merely and exclusively as an
expert committee, that would hardly surprise me and is certainly consistent
with the requotings of the press release I have read since you started this
little flamewar.

Where is it written that expert committees so authorized cannot issue
press releases in the name of that committee?

Geez, I suggest again that you let the ACM clean up its own poop if there
is any to clean up to begin with.

Um, I myself would not make that charge without finding out if this is a new
or old committee and who gave them the name.  You'll look very odd if that
was the official name the ACM gave the group, doubly so if it has been used
before on earlier press releases without incident, triply so if they were
told, as part of their charter, to issue such a press release on this topic 
in the name of that particular committee.

My educated guess is that it is an existing group or organized something like a
Select Committee in congress.  Either way, the main organization would have
picked the name and probably explicitly chartered the press release.  
If not, it is part of your alleged poop the ACM has to clean up.  Anything
is possible, but I've been part of pretty penny-ante little nonprofit
groups that had their act together well enough to avoid the kind of fiasco
you are alleging.  And, these groups made some pretty dumb mistakes of other
kinds.

Why do your postings here have the odor of sour grapes?  Maybe it
is because the charges you are making could have been so easily checked out
and are so unlikely to be true.  I await the next CACM; we'll all see then.

Okay, this is probably a totally moronic question but here goes
anyway..........

As I understand it, breaking RSA is hard, but you know for certain
when you have the answer - there is only one pair of factors for
the public key : once you have them, you have the plain text.

With DES, your only option is to search the entire key space. 
Presumably, this means that you get 2^54 versions of the 'decrypted'
message. Without using human intervention, how do you decide which
of these is the actual message? Is checking for occurrences of a few
common words enough, or does this still leave you with thousands
of potential candidates to look at? What if you don't know what
language the message was written in? What if the message was compressed
before encryption etc etc?

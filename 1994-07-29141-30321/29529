This is the d'Agapeyeff Cipher, a one-off effort produced as a challenge
at the end of a cryptography book by Alexander d'Agapeyeff in 1939 -- so
it's pre-WW2.  In my opinion d'Agapeyeff was not knowledgeable about
ciphers.  He wrote a cartography book in a series for Oxford University
Press, so I assume he was later tapped for this one in the same series.
Quite a few people have had a go at it, and an article was written about
it in an early Cryptologia pointing out some of the statistical oddities.
My current theory is that he was trying to execute a Mirabeau cipher (like
a checkerboard with nulls) but botched the encryption in some unknown way.
This challenge cipher was removed from later editions; when interviewed he
said he no longer remembered how he had done it, according to an article
in The Cryptogram.

Rather than "unbreakable" I'd prefer to call it "as-yet unbroken".

   This problem won't go away if you have one big key-certification
center somewhere.  *Some* employees of even a big, hard-to-intimidate
organization are going to be bribed, blackmailed, etc., into handing
out fake certificates.
 
  The simplest way to get around this kind of problem is to check
public keys out-of-band (by telephone), or to keep a hash of conversations
you've had with a person by PGP-encrypted e-mail, and then exchange it
with them at some point--if the hashes don't match up, something ugly
has happened.

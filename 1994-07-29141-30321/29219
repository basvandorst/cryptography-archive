Subject: Algorithms for encryption techniques (DES, RSA)
Lines: 30

Please excuse the anonymous posting, our machines news system ain't
working.

I am trying to find algorithms for writing a encryption system to
provide password checking (within Windows) in my application.

I've read the crypt and security FAQs but haven't been able to get
any information other than implementations, or the theory concerning
DES/RSA's unbreakability.  I has also checked our nearest archive
server without luck.

If there are any simple program modules or similar I could just plug
in, I'd appreciate pointers to their location.

Please could any answers be emailed (I'll summarise if reqd), as our
news system is broken.  (We don't even have a TCP link, no
telnet/ftp/gopher etc, just my luck)  email : yates@lgx.unisys.ch

TIA

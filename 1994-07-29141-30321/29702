I probably wasn't even the first to propose this, but I wrote
articles in sci.crypt in 1988-89 about the "LSB method," wherein
messages, presumably encrypted, are placed in the least significant
bit of a GIF or other image, or in the LSBs of digital audio tapes.
(Cf. Kevin Kelly's article in "Whole Earth Review," Summer 1993, or in
his new book, "Out of Control," for a description.)

A version of this was hacked in PhotoShop, by me.

Several "stego" (steganography, which is of course what this is)
programs now exist, notably "JSTEG" (pun on JPEG) and "Stego."

Romana Machado's "Stego" program for the Mac has gotten a fair amount
of attention. I think it's available at the sumex.stanford.edu archive
site.

Interestingly, law enforcement types are speculating that the computer
porn folks using the Lawrence Livermore Labs computers were using the
LSB method to smuggle out defense secrets. I doubt it pretty strongly.

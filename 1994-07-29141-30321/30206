The Bletchley Park Trust demonstrate a virtual Enigma at their museum. I 
believe it was written by a local (like next door) college. It presents a nice 
perspective rendering of the Enigma box, you can open the flap at the front to 
change the settings there and open the lid to pull the wheels out and change 
the slip rings, etc etc etc. You push buttons on the virtual keyboard 
(point&click) and the lamps light - just like the real thing!

I believe that it was running on an Acorn Archimedies.

I don't have a very good contact address to hand, but the following should 
work:
Bletchley Park Trust
Bletchley Park
Wilton Avenue
Bletchley, England

Bletchley Park was where work on breaking cyphers was done during WW II. The 
Trust is trying to secure the site as a museum of Signals Intelligence 
(including cryptography) and of the history of computing. The owners may 
have other ideas (they did afterall knock down the first 'computer room', 
home of Colossus I, for no readily apparent reason). AFAIK it is open 
alternate weekends.

My opinions are my own, not my employer's

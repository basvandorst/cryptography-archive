As I wrote before, and as you claimed you discussed with RSA DSI, I sent
a letter to RSA DSI stating I wished to use PGP non-commercially and
asking if they had any objections or claims to assert.  They sent a
response that did not indicate any objections but did include the
statement of policy that RSA could be used freely for personal,
intellectual, or academic reasons.  No restrictions on traffic were
mentioned by either of us.  This was prior to PGP 2.5.

The complaint was about the past week or so, during which period neither tmp
nor I had posted. Wrong again, James.

Do you have some problem with democracy? You get to express your views, but
you don't get to tell others how to vote.

In your case, extreme moderation would be a good idea. Your current post is
but one good example of why.  :-)

taken to extremes the spurious notion of freedom without responsibility, and

are told by their pals that they are in the middle of the road. Nothing is
wrong any more (except, of course, conservative thoughts and expressions).

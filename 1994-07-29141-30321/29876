I don't know about "as you well know" but perhaps there was a difference in
detail between what you asked for and what I asked for. I asked for
permission to use PGP (pre 2.6) for research purposes, with no transmission
or reception of any PGP-encrypted traffic outside my own machine. What did
you ask for?

The values that define our common-sense world are under assault. Some have
taken to extremes the spurious notion of freedom without responsibility, and
are trying to tear down moral guardrails. Those who live on the shoulders
are told by their pals that they are in the middle of the road. Nothing is
wrong any more (except, of course, conservative thoughts and expressions).

Huh?  This tells me that DES has a weakness that is now
publicly known, and that it may still (just like IDEA)
have others.  And one attack -- a brute force keysearch
machine for known plaintext -- has become uncomfortably
cheap already for DES.

True, but IDEA has held up to all the attacks learned in the
last 15 years.  It is hard to predict which algorithm will fare
best when the next new attack is found.

With DES you know how someone, today, using publicly known
attacks, will likely attack your system, and you can estimate
the upper bound of your security accordingly.


Don't get me wrong: I too am a little leary of the faith placed
in IDEA given its relative newness, but it has been around
long enough for the "standard attacks" to have been tried,
and it's 128 bit key means that a *really* serious weakness
will need to be found in order for it to be worse than
(single) DES.

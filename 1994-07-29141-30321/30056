Spoken like a true, blue, card-carrying member of the "Friends of Big
Brother."  I think David Sternlight's member number must be in the low
tens...

Seriously, if someone sees the abuse of export control laws for the
setting of domestic policy to be "big brotherish," well, it's not at
all a cheap shot to say so.  Not everyone has David's blind faith in
the goodness of our government and the goodness of the laws passed by
our least-common-denominator elected servants.

Not all laws are good, or even sensible.  Even our Al Gorewellian VP
has effectively admitted (in his letter to Cantwell) that export
controls are not being perpetuated to keep dangerous crypto munitions
out of the hands of furiners.  It's been obvious all along that the
government is blatantly abusing the ITAR regs to fragment the crypto
market.

I call that "big brotherish," too.  And they want us to trust them?

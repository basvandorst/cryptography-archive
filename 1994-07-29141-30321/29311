Once they go public they expose themselves to any criticism non-members may
wish to levy. They ignore it at their peril with respect to the good opinion
of yet other parties and the effectiveness of their advocacies. They may
safely ignore non-members only if they publish findings privately for the
broader membership. Once they start issuing press releases the "members
only" game is over.

The values that define our common-sense world are under assault. Some have
taken to extremes the spurious notion of freedom without responsibility, and
are trying to tear down moral guardrails. Those who live on the shoulders
are told by their pals that they are in the middle of the road. Nothing is
wrong any more (except, of course, conservative thoughts and expressions).

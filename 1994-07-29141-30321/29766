For further info, see Cryptologia, April, 1978. ``The Unsolved D'Agapeyeff
Cipher" by Wayne G. Barker, pp 144-147.... The code posted to usenet
is the same as that appearing in magazine.
	(in other words no apparent errors).
	The article poses four possibilities:
	1) Has a form of transposition taken place within columns?
Between rows?
	2) Has a form of "addition" taken place within columns?
This might explaine, for example, the last column on the right
which might have an "additive" different from other columns (Barker
is referring to the 14x14 matrix version of message)....
	3) Do perhaps the numbers in the last column serve as some
sort of "check" or "indicating device" for the other two-digit numbers
within the same or next row?
	4) Is it possible that a three-digit system is involved? Within
each row there are a total of 28 digits. If one digit serves as a check/
indicator, the remaining 27 digits divide into nine different three-
digit groups.....
	Also..... "if the three final zeros are treated as nulls
then the only other zero in the cryptogram falls almost at the
midpoint of the message! Chance? Significant? It appears that the
cryptogram is certainly capable of being solved and a mathematical
approach in analyzing columns might eventually lead to solution.
	Are the frequence distributions of odd columns compatible with
the frequency distributions of even columns? Are there other things in the
cryptogram that appear unusual? ... Might the cryptogram be broken
into two smaller squares or rectangles? These and
other questions make the d'Agapeyeff challenge extremely interesting.

Oxford University Press, 1939)
	
	Cheers and good luck...

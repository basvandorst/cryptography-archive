   I don't think that "Big Brother" is going to spend a lot of time
trying to crack every random-looking file that comes across the net.
Instead, he's likely to spend his resources cracking known or strongly
suspected "important" messages.  I suspect that there will be a degree
of human intervention here--a scanning system that usually identifies
98% of net traffic notices a pattern of unidentifiable binaries flowing
between Alice and Bob, and so it logs it.  After a while, a human starts
looking more closely at Alice and Bob's message traffic, where they
work, what their interests are, etc.  This will have three possible
results:
 
1.  The investigator decides that he's found a new "standard" file type
    that should be added to the system.
 
2.  The investigator decides that the undecipherable traffic between
    Alice and Bob either isn't encrypted data, or that if it is, they
    probably don't have much interesting to say to each other, and they
    are put on some kind of "ignore" list.
 
3.  The investigator decides that there's something interesting going
    on here, and decides to spend more resources checking out Alice
    and Bob more carefully.  Their nonsecured communications may be
    monitored, or (if it's feasible) they may get a visit from their
    friendly neighborhood police, investigating an "anonymous tip" or
    something.
 
    Everyone seems to be imagining that the NSA just looks at a random
looking block of bits, feeds it into their codebreaking machine, and
out comes plaintext--for any nontrivial cipher that they haven't seen
(ie, something slightly nonstandard) and for any decent cipher that they
have seen, this isn't the case--they'd spend unacceptable amounts
on decrypting weird, nonstandard graphics formats and love letters
encrypted with IDEA or DES or something.

   To misquote some Supreme Court Justice of the future,
"I can't define pornography, but my computer knows it when it sees
it."

This is blatantly NOT true.  Just because the SCSI drivers are not available
to the machine (either because the drive was not powered on at boot time, or
you failed to enter the correct password) does not mean the drive is
unavailable to probing.  Anyone who tells you the contrary does not know what
they are talking about.  You do not need access to the SCSI drivers to issue
raw SCSI commands to the drive (this is trivial for someone with a little
programming experience, and IM-4 or NIM: OS Utilities - about four lines of
code to send a raw SCSI command).  I've seen very successful results from 
this form of attack on other "secure" products for the Mac, and would bet
that Norton is not much better (unless they acutally do DES at the lowest
level, it can, and will, be broken).

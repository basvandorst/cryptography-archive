   I understand, and this makes sense to me.  People will consider a
cipher questionable at best if it's vulnerable to attacks requiring
lots of chosen-plaintext, yet very few serious applications are going
to use the cipher in a way that will ever give an attacker that kind
of access.  (Ie, most real applications will use CBC or CFB modes.)

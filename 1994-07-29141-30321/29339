I think the demise of DES and other such 
systems are very much overrated.  I published 
a design of a mchine that would break DES and 
only cost 16 Million.  There are few bits of 
data worth 16 Million to break.

How secure the system must be depends on a lot 
of factors like how vauble is it to others.  
How long will it retain that value?  In 
finanical transactions the value is great, but 
the lifetime is very short.  In national 
security stuff the time is longer, sometimes 
but the value can be very great.  In coperate 
secrets I think people assume a greater value 
than is real.  

The question is will it be secure for the time 
you need it be secure.  DES for most 
applications will be secure for all time.

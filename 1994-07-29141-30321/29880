What nonsense. If anyone has been, I have been critical of Phil where I
though it deserved in the past, and supportive where I thought that
deserved. In the present case I support Phil, but try as I might I can find
no altar, candles, or holy book with Phil's name on it.

H'mm I guess you haven't checked the supermarket shelves lately.

As has already been pointed out, if you would take the trouble to read
before going off half-cocked, an owner of intellectual property may license
it on different terms to different people. This is particularly unambiguous
when different versions are involved. But you are even further off base. GNU
is a license, not a trademark protection. The trademark issues are
completely separate, and Phil is on solid ground, I think, on that. If GNU
says "you may modify" that doesn't subsume "and you may call your
modification by my trademarked name."

Here you post falsehoods you know to be untrue because you have made
contrary advacies in the past, as I recall.

Phil didn't steal; he infringed (in the past).

The algorithm is not patented. You can't patent algorithms. The crypto
system is patented.

I haven't heard cut monkeys squeal, but I have heard them when someone else
took their banana. Phil's rational comments bear no resemblance to this
shameful attempt to compare Phil to a monkey. I know it's your style to argue
in this disgraceful way, having been the recipient of it in the past, but
believe me, you have long ago discredited yourself by the use of such
slime tactics.

Your statement is also a falsehood. Phil did not complain because someone
"modified his free software" but because someone called that modification by
his trademarked name without permission.

A little more honesty and less gutter argumentation would be nice.

The values that define our common-sense world are under assault. Some have
taken to extremes the spurious notion of freedom without responsibility, and
are trying to tear down moral guardrails. Those who live on the shoulders
are told by their pals that they are in the middle of the road. Nothing is
wrong any more (except, of course, conservative thoughts and expressions).

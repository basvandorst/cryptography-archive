(I think that was me) Anyway, it sounds good, but unless I'm missing
something, there seems to be one major flaw: The "free" space.  If I'm
a certain view, and I have no knowledge of any other views except my
children, what happens when I need to write a new file? I allocate
some "free" space, and write over it.  Unfortunately, since I do not
know about any of the other views, the "free" space I write over could
be another duress view's data, or system information, or even <gasp>
the master data that I have worked so hard to protect.  
Having the view have a table of "real" free pages would defeat the
whole thing. "Hmm, you have 250 megs used, 100 megs free, but this is
a 1.6 gigabyte drive!" 
Being only able to write files when the master view is open would
solve one problem, but would give a quick test to see if this is the
real master view or a duress view: Simply try to write a file. 
Another problem, slightly unrelated, is the file date on the files in
the duress views.  Unless there was a master "date" daemon that
constantly updated certain file dates, the dates on the unused
"duress" files are going to be rather suspicious. 

Don't mean to "flame" your system, there are a lot of good ideas
there.. But I don't see how it would work the way you describe it.

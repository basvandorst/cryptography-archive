 Well, no.

 Any cipher which produces network-transportable text (e.g, PGP),
 will produce compressable output.

 Nor can one always argue that this is not "part of the cipher
 algorithm:"  My commercial email cipher Penknife produces
 network-ASCII ciphertext as "part of the algorithm."  That is,
 part of the "strength" comes *after* the 8-bit-to-6-bit
 conversion.  Only reasons of efficiency (which may not be either
 universal or important) prevent the conversion from being done
 *on the plaintext*, prior to ciphering as 6-bit symbols.

 No, it's not *quite* that simple.

 My Penknife cipher certainly is a substitution cipher, it just
 happens to be a *Dynamic* Substitution cipher.  I believe Penknife
 offers serious "protection," and am willing to discuss the design
 in detail if you have doubts.

 When laying down the law to newbies, it is important to not
 over-generalize.

IBM *does* have encryption products supported under OS/2.  The IBM 4755
Cryptographic Adapter is fully supported under all versions of OS/2, as well
as other operating systems.  It's available in both ISA and MicroChannel
versions.  The Personal Security Card family of smart cards (with DES) is
also supported under OS/2.  We've been shipping products in this family
since 1989.

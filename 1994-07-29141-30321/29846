I wrote that article in MacWorld.  DO NOT USE DISKLOCK.  The program stores
the key with the encrypted file.  The best Mac security program, which was
released after I wrote the article, is CryptoMactic by Kent Marsh Ltd.  It
uses triple-DES in CBC mode, hashes an arbitrary-length password into a
key, and has a whole lot of Mac-interface features.  (The Windows equivalent
is FolderBolt for Windows, by the way.)

..so you will definitely want to never use a gif for which "the enemy"
has access to a "known," else they would just do a file-comparison to
find the "flaws."  That may be a not-uneconomical (ie, routinely do-able)
thing for them to do.  So, if you want to do photos, you'll have to make
_your_own_ porn gifs (home-movies), then take on exhibitionistis tendencies.

..no, we don't want to examine the nipples on "Hoover-in-the-Buff."
So, how about only imbedding into dark or light-field areas?  We
could do like "linked-lists" and "pointers" where each data-bit
directs in which dark-field to find the next data-laden pixels.
That is simple camoflauge.  Also, it lets you load up the photo
with a better than 60:1 ratio of info:garbage via strategic chaos.
 
But, even better, my Cheech y Chong records are really showing their
age.  They've got a lot of exploitable static.  Superficially, I
can tell that I am obviously listening to "Sargent Stadenko," but
gosh there's a lot of static, and nobody else's LP records could
serve as a "known" in comparison to my "unknown" because of it.
 
Anything helpful here?

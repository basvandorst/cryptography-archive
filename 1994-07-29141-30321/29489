I tried to add the encryption modules to zip and unzip today
and ran into a small problem. Zip built without incident, but
I cannot say the same for unzip. All parts compile ok, but errors
during the linking phase. There are duplicate functions (echon,
echoff, getp) in both zcrypt.c and file_io.c which I simply
commented out. The problem is that zcrypt is looking for a macro
or function called CRC32, which I cannot find anywhere. Anybody
have a suggestion?

I am sorry if this is in the wrong group. If it is,
could someone direct me to the correct one.

Tom

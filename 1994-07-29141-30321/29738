The problem is that only a part of the interesting material will migrate
to sci.crypt.research (because many people like the faster posting of an
unmoderated group, others are opposed to moderation in principle and will
thus will avold the group, others will believe their own postings aren't
high enough quality so don't submit them). Thus most people will end up
subscribing to both groups. It takes more effort to follow two groups
than one group, so people will be worse of. The solution is instead to
set up groups for popular subjects which large numbers of people aren't
interested in as I stated in my previous posting.

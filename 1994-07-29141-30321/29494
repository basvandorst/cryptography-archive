Curve Encrypt 1.1, IDEA encryption for the Macintosh is now available.

Curve Encrypt is a freeware drag-and-drop encryption application for the 
Macintosh. It uses IDEA cipher-feedback mode with a 255 character pass 
phrase, encrypts both the data and resource forks of files, and will
encrypt the contents of a folder or volume in a single operation. Source
code is provided, natch. CE is System 7 only.

(Note that this program has nothing whatsoever to do with elliptic curve
encryption methods, just so nobody gets confused...)


NEW FOR 1.1

The following changes have been made for the 1.1 release:

o Faster encryption and decryption.

o Faster file wipes.

o Department of Defense standard file wiping is now an option.

o The "Use as default pass phrase" selection is no longer present. Instead, 
Curve Encrypt 1.1 uses keyfiles, a more reliable way to reuse pass phrases. 

o Curve Encrypt now saves the creation and modification dates of files when 
they're encrypted, and restores them to their original values when a file is 
decrypted. 

o An incompatibility with the Super Boomerang utility has been fixed.

You are misinformed.

The holders of the patent on that algorithm and Phil Zimmermann have
settled their differences.  They did not press charges against Phil,
and have worked with him to provide the current licensing arrangement
for PGP 2.6, in which all U.S. and Canadian citizens get to use the
"patented algorithm" for non-commercial personal or educational
purposes.  This issue is dead.  IMHO, PGP's popularity is the best
thing that's happened to RSA's revenue stream.

But what is not dead is Phil's legal problem's with certain federal
authorities who think that posting code to a the U.S. portion of a
computer network is the same as exporting it from the U.S.

Again you are misinformed.  Go back and read what Phil wrote.  He
objected not to the code modification but to the modified software
using the name "PGP".

Yeah, it really looks like you have "no problem" with Phil's actions.

Right back at ya', guy.

I am not a programmer.  I am also not a crypto expert.  I have recently
started experimenting with drive (device) encryption using packages
available from the net.  Such as:  secdrv.zip (secure drive), secdev.zip
(secure device), and sfs100.zip (secure file system).  All of the
software that I have tested so far has been easy to use and easy to set up.
 
Has anyone ( with more programming and crypto experience than me ) looked
at these packages.  What are your impressions?  What other packages are
available and what are your thoughts on them?
 
I am a PC user running windows on a 486.

thanks for your help.

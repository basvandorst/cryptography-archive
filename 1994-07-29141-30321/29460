Scuse me, but aint that the kind of pc crap that them there liberals spew 
when they are offended by some person using a perfectly normal word, and 
they take it to mean something else, then blaim the person speaking for 
their own stupidity, as if they were victimized somehow by the words of 
someone else?

Why, if that is conservative, I would hate to see a comunist.:-)

I have been reading the Applied Cryptography book and the part about the 
XOR encrpytion caught my eye. I'd like to try out the method proposed in
the book but the details about counting coincidence are a bit blurry. I
tried to get the book that was given as a reference from the library and
a book store to no avail. Could someone show me how counting coincidence
is done ? Any help is appreciated...


Thanks, -- Kris

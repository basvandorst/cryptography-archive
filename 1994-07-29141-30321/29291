Hell if someone is going to take responsibility what I do it gotta be 
myself. That somebody would now post this diskette to me and be 
cought I bet that person wouldn't go to jail. Or if he would it would 
raise big noice.

So is there some organisations to finance this case ?
I am not rich but I would put my $2000 for that. Why because I believe
that right to use strong crypto that can't be breaken by any snoops
must be part of the civil rights all over the globe. And because
United States has always been the example everybody follows.
That's why it would set a good example.

I am sorry to use this kind of language what you are going to 
read on the next line but I just can't keep it inside:

David dear Piss of again !

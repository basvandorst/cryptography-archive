1) You are not supposed to buy it; it's free.

2) AT&T does not make the Clipper chip; Mykotronix (sp?) does.

3) The package comes in source, so if you don't trust it, you can
inspect it yourself... if you are competent to do so, of course...
which I strongly doubt, provided the general cluelessness demonstrated
by your article.

4) The package is by the same person who exposed a severe security
hole in Clipper.

Obviously, they think that you are significantly less stupid than you
are in reality. Get a clue and stop hiding behind an anonymous
account.

Would security increase if I were to encrypt something using IDEA, followed
by triple DES, and then a final round of IDEA?  What would the resulting
key length be?  Would there be any difference in security if the same keys
were used for the IDEA encrypting?

Hypothectically, if a cipher had some sort of trapdoor, would triple
encrypting something with it increase its security?

Also, please send me or post information regarding the Diamond cipher.

Thanks in advance,

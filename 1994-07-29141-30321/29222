  Unless you can show us that the ACM does *not* stand behind the committee
report, you are treading the line between mere insult and outright slander
with that "misrepresenting themselves" comment.

  Which is standard operating procedure when issues requiring a specialized
range of expertise come up.

  Perhaps you can cite examples in which issues requiring a specialized
range of expertise were referred to a vote of the membership rather than
to a committee of people with the relevant background.

  If I were a member of the committee, I would censure you for smearing the
legitimacy of my ACM credentials.

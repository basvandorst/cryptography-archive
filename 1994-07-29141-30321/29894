Not so fast, Bruce.

1. Are you talking about the current version of Norton Disklock, which uses
David Shayer's program, acquired via the FGS acquisition?

2. Are you talking about FILE encryption or DISK protection?

3. In talking about file encryption are you talking about the DES option, or
about the  low-security quick and dirty option they also offer, with
warnings for those who want speed and simple unreadability rather than high
security?

4. I have encrypted files with the DES option and cannot find the password
in the data fork; there is no resource fork. I have looked with both BBEDIT
and with ResEd.

5. They may be using a one-way hash algorithm for the DES password, and
storing THAT with the file in the case of the DES encryption, but how do you
suggest one break that?

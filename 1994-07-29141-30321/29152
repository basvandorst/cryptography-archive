I recently downloaded a system called 'S-Tools' which does just this.
Encrypts in both .wav files and .gif/.bmp files. It is very impressive!

I forgot where I got it, but probably heard of it on this group.
If anyone knows of the ftp location of this file please post it
for everyone to examine. Otherwise, I may post it to an archive site.

Wasn't this version in question called 3DEA-PGP?  Or something like that.
It did have a different name.  It also had information inside the archive that
pointed out what it was and it also was found in a directory called "variants"
under a pgp directory.  
The idea of Phil expecting us to follow the rules of his trademarks are 
totally hypocritical (There is also the issue of respect for Phil vs. the
respect of the law) when he broke similar rules to get this trademark.
I think it would be wrong and dangerous if someone was trying to distribute
3dea-pgp as PGP2.6, but this wasn't the case.  
Even if it was, the enhancements to it are options you have to apply.

I don't think this is nearly as serious as it is being made out to be.
How come we are all talking about this but never heard a thing about 2.6ui
releases? (the u stands for unofficial, if that is enough name change to
please everyone then "3dea-pgp" should be)

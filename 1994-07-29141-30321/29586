Nice try but you forget the .sig lines on that message extolling the virtues
of anonymous posting, so to speak, and offering the service.

Something that's blatantly anonymous isn't the same as someone providing a
persona that's actually invented. We take some things on good faith in life,
including a "From" line that's not obviously bogus. Taking such things on
faith isn't the same as responding to an overtly anonymous poster. You are
SURE the anonymous poster is concealing his identity, for whatever reason,
but most posters here who use names or userids are what they seem--honest
people with honest identities.

Putting it another way, you behave differently with respect to a masked man
coming into a bank than you might to someone who MIGHT have had plastic
surgery. :-)

The values that define our common-sense world are under assault. Some have
taken to extremes the spurious notion of freedom without responsibility, and
are trying to tear down moral guardrails. Those who live on the shoulders
are told by their pals that they are in the middle of the road. Nothing is
wrong any more (except, of course, conservative thoughts and expressions).

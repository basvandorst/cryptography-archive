Well, fortunately I am in Canada.  I would never have to worry about exporting
the DES code from the US,  only importing to the US.

Is there a problem with importing DES encryption software in the US, having
my users use it and export the encrypted data out of the US back to me?

Also... since many Internet networks will send my mail from Canada to 
any other country, via the USA,  does this constitute exporting from the USA??

And if such mail had a binary attachment of DES encryption software....

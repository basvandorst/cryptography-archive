MIT spun off RSADSI to commercialize its public-key patents.
Stnaford did the same (I forget the company's name).
After figuring out that the patents overlapped, all four
(two universities and two companies) formed Public Key Partners
to license all the patents.

So PKP is just a holding company that licenses the patents.  RSADSI
and the Stanford company (and others with arrangments from PKP)
actually *do* things with them.  RSADSI has a particularly flexible
license from PKP, allowing them to issue sublicenses.

The fact that the same man runs PKP and RSADSI (I've heard them described
as "his left and right pockets") adds to the difficulty of making the
distinction.

   Hmmm.  My inclination would be to trust IDEA more than MDC/SHS,
because IDEA seems to have been the subject of greater scrutiny in
the academic world.  However, there is not a general way of measuring
reliably how strong a given block cipher is, other than attempting to
attack it, or looking for potential weaknesses in things that just
don't "feel" right.
 
   However, you're looking for relative security of CFS vs Secure Drive
as a whole--rarely is an encryption system the easiest point of attack
against a system like this.  I believe that the design of CFS was
discussed in a paper, available somewhere by anonymous ftp.  You could
probably look at the source code for Secure Drive and try to compare
approaches to different things (password hashing, dealing with random-
access to encrypted data, etc.) I'd be interested in any results you
can share with us--even just a brief note comparing the two.

The two fastest algorithms are being fielded shortly. Wheeler's WAKE is being 
taken up by a well known UK software company, and IBM are going to use Rogaway 
and Coppersmith's SEAL in some network security products.

As for the other algorithms, Jim Massey's SAFER is fielded in Cylink products
and is especially suited for smartcards; Joan Daemen's 3-WAY is being put in 
silicon; I expect that the RSADSI proposal and the Italian telecom lab's VINO 
will turn up in products in due course; and clock-controlled shift registers of 
the type discussed by Bill Chambers are fielded in their millions already, not
least as the A5 algorithm used to encrypt GSM.

I have no information on whether Siemens' FISH or IBM's shrinking generator
will be fielded (and the latter is no faster than DES is software anyway). My
own rotor machine was intended as a challenge as much as a production system,
and Bruce Schneier's BLOWFISH has appeared in Dr Dobbs and elsewhere.

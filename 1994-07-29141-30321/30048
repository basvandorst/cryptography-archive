I understood that.  I was just pointing out that by using the
pad the second time he was violating the cardinal rule of
the one-time pad -- each bit of it is to be used at most
once for encryption.  And once you violate the cardinal rule
you no longer are using a one-time pad.  Mr. Hoselton's
suggestion was just an extreme case of violating the one-time
rule.

I'm apparently not being clear.  Yes, it is a double transposition.
Each of the constituent transposition phases (columnar transposition
and iterated fixed block-size permutation) are readily attackable in
isolation.  A composite of two transpositions winds up being just a
different transposition.  I understand all of this.  I also
understand the general attack on transposition ciphers: multiple
anagramming.

But a necessary condition for applying multiple anagramming is that
you have at least two ciphertexts that are the result of the same
permutation; typically this means that they are both the same length
and have been transposed under the same key.  In fact, this is the
attack on the "iterated fixed block-size permutation" transposition
cipher that I'm using as a component.

Except for very short messages, single anagramming is not a valid
cryptanalysis, as there will be many possible anagrams with no way of
determening which one is valid.  This is what makes multiple
anagramming useful:  you can check the anagram in one message against
the same permutation in the other message(s).

In my proposal the two keys (one for each of the underlying
transpositions) are chosen *at random* for a session key.  With
appropriate selection of block-sizes the probability that the same
key will be used for two seperate messages can be made arbritrarily
small, and thus render multiple anagramming of the system
impossible.  And the iterated permutation cannot (as far as I can
see) be multiple anagrammed in my system because the target
anagrams are just the scrambled jumble created by the columnar
transpositon -- that is to say: there is no "sense" to the intermediate
text, and so there is no guidance to whether your anagrams are
"meaningful".

Also, to repeat the opening line:
>It looks like some sort of double transposition.  Thanks to an embarrassing
>post I made, I learned that these are indeed solvable.

I have little faith that my proposed cryptosystem is insoluble.  But
I want to understand *how* it can be attacked.  If my analysis above
is flawed, I want to know *where* I'm mistaken.  I don't even really
care if the attack is "practical" (brute-force doesn't count,
however).  I'm trying to learn, and I am not seeing how this can be
attacked.

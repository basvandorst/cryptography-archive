Recently, there have been debates regarding the strength of various Mac
hard drive security products.  Which one is considered the strongest?  Do
any use IDEA in addition to or instead of DES?

I have heard of two products called SFS and SecureDrive.  What exactly are
these?  Are they available for the Mac?  If not, what are their Mac
equivalents?

Thank you in advance.

     I really can't let this one go.  While I agree that the US
government wants to be able to read *some* communications, I strongly
suspect (based largely on reading this group) that there are at least
*some* foreign governments with even more restrictive policies.
Implying that the US government has the most restrictive crypto policy
in the world just makes the average citizen stop paying attention to the
folks making that implication.  The members of this group can't run US
crypto policy; we have to convince the average citizen.

     I assume that no such implication was actually intended.  But
remember that newspapers have been grabbing UseNet posts for
publication...

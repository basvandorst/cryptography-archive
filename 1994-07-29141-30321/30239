The "freely available" public release doesn't have any escrow 
features. No smart cards. The key is simply based on a passphrase. 

The approach used is fairly portable and doesn't involve any mucking 
around in the file system code in the kernel. It runs on (at least) 
Linux, Sun OS 4.x and 5.x, AIX [rs6k], Irix, HP/UX and BSD/386. 

The main drawback is that the performance is less than stellar. 
However, it isn't really all that bad when compared to the read/write 
performance of NFS mounted file systems over ethernet. (e.g. I get 
about 60Kbytes/second on a 486DX/33 laptop running Linux with a local 
IDE disk). 

CFS fills an important niche. As far as I know, there is no other 
general (and free!) alternative for encryption of a Unix filesystem.

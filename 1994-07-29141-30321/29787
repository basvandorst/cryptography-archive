I have read that in the past the US government forbade the
exporting of compression/decompression software that used the DES 
algorithm, and I believe even information encrypted in DES format.

Is this still the case?

I have found some DES source and would like to create a windows program that
I would like to distribute free of charge, to registered users of one of our 
other products.

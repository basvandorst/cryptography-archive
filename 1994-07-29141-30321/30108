Does anyone know where I can get more information on the
Engima code?  I understand that a simulator of the Engima
machine has been written in C.  Is there a place I can get
this via FTP?

I realize that Enigma is not state-of-the-art, and I have
already seen crypt(1).  Any pointers would be appreciated.

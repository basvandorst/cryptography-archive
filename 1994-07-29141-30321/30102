I've been working on a few different transposition systems, some
very simple such as fence rail and some complicated like WW-II type
double transposition. The methods I have at my disposal are the usual 
statistical tools as well as a computer  Most of what goes on is to
test one transposition form after another until something begins to 
"work." It seem to me that there must be some family of statistical 
procedures to shortcut this work.  Right now, the computer simply automates
shuffling characters around in hundreds of test patterns. Checking 
rows and columns for character and vowel balance, sometimes correlation
is used. But chiefly, there is a lot of shuffling.For inspiration
I look at the various orthogonal transforms and wonder if something
similar or like it couldn't be developed to treat transposition systems.
Is this idea workable?  Perhaps a group of tests to at least separate
families of transposition systems? 

As far as I know none of the WW-II military cryptie books speak in this
direction, however, some of Friedman's early monographs contain tantilizing
hints in this direction.

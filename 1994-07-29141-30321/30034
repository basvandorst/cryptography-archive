   It seems like you could do some nice pre-processing on a block
transposition cipher by automatically searching for letter pairs
and triples that go together, where at least one of the letters is
rare enough to not appear too many times throughout the block.
 
   With even a small bit of known plaintext, you could probably
automate such a search to find that block of known plaintext in
some form.  That would give you some information about the transposition
used.  Of course, if you could choose the plaintext, you could
make the search simple by inventing new rules for which letters follow
which, ie z always follows u, which may be followed by a blank or a
t, t's are always followed by m's or r's, etc.
 
   Has anyone ever done this sort of attack on this kind of system?
Or am I missing some important obstacle to this kind of an attack?

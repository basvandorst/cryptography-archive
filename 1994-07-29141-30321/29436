If one knows they won't prosecute (and one does) one can tell them to 
"blow it out your ass."  One should not respect people who make 
meaningless threats.  

Of course, one should only do such things if one is judgment proof.  But 
one should be so in any case.

I don't know why Phil hired expensive lawyers.  You have a right to act as 
your own counsel.  Not a bad idea as long as you convince youself to say 
nothing. 

Is there anyone here who believes that the Feds would prosecute for crypto 
export and put those rules in play?

"BTW - there is this belief that people who are judgment proof have no 
assets.  This is false.  Those who are judgement proof merely have no 
*attachable* assets."

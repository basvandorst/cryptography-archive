This might be slightly off the subject, but I need to find out what zero
knowledge proofs are and how they can be applied to authentication without
a cascade of trust. What I'm after is not just establishing a secure
channel with a second party but at the same time establishing the identity
of the second party without having to trust anyone else. Is this possible
at all?

Thanks for any insights! --JYL

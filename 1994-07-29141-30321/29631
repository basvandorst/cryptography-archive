Kind of weak.

I know of at least one case of the validation check being hacked, where 
someone inserted harmful code in a .ZIP file, then faked it as being from 
another source.  The hack was imperfect, in that the hacked .ZIP file 
showed the wrong registration number for the source.  A more sure 
approach is to use a real digital signature, but since BBS software 
frequently alters .ZIP files to insert ads, etc., the best validation 
approach I know of right now is to use a detached signature (i. e. with 
PGP) on a .ZIP file, then wrap both the signature and the .ZIP file up in 
another .ZIP file.  Of course, you then have to have a trusted public key 
from the source, and a separate program (PGP) to validate the signature 
with.

Is it just me? or do the rest of you also believe that the trademark
"Pretty Good" is one of the least valuable trademarks every to be
complained about?

I have no idea why somebody might feel the need to use mega-triple-IDEA, but
if you do, and PRZ doesn't like it, you might as well come up with a new name.

How about OK cryptography (for Over Kill)? You can call up Coca-Cola and
arrange a marketing campaign that bundles OK cryptography with OK Cola.


---------------------------- OK coincidence $FF58 --------------------------

The first time Ima Hick of Shaker Heights, Ohio tried "OK" cryptography,
she put an unopened can of "OK" soda next to her keyboard. She was then able
to factor three 4096 bit numbers into their strong prime factors on
her Commodore 64 in three minutes. NOTE: WHEN SHE FINISHED, THE CAN OF
"OK," STILL UNOPENED, WAS EMPTY. This is only a coincidence.

"OK" cryptography says, "Don't be fooled into thinking there has to be a key
for all cyphertexts."

In both these cases there was a different legal situation than would exist
if somebody exported non-government crypto. These people were communicating
secret information. US law has made it illegal to knowingly transmit secret
information. Its a civil offense if they are private sector secrets and its
treason if they are government secrets. This would simply not apply to the
transmission of public information.

More importantly, I believe it has been held that in order to regulate free
speach in situations like the above, there must be some other freedom which
would be trampled upon (pun intended :-) were your freedom of speach exercised.
Thus, once it was demonstrated that my free speach was being interfered with
[something that I believe would be quite obvious], the government would be
forced to demonstrate the utility of the ban on crypto as a deterent to
foreign intelligence operatives, a losing battle if ever there was one.
If this goes another round, I'll get out the precise wording from supreme
court references.

The FBI lost that one ultimatelly.

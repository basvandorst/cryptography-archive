It is not always easy to understand lawyers.  I guess, in the
case of sci.crypt, they think as follows (I am not a lawyer,
though, so all standard disclaimers apply):

- Every poster is responsible for the contents of his posts, not
  the admins of the systems, who carry the group.  So it is legal
  for the network providers to distribute sci.scrypt worldwide.

  This same logic is used against Phil Zimmermann.  He is accused
  for putting his software on public access computers, not the
  telephone and network companies, for actually transmitting the
  data.

- Import of crypto material is allowed into the US.  So posts from
  outside the US may contain the "forbidden" stuff, (if local laws
  permit it).

However, if someone archives everything of sci.crypt, then putting
it up for world wide ftp, they would commit a crime: export of
crypto knowledge.

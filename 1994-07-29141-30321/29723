Yes.  And Phil did indeed trademark PGP.  Here's an excerpt from the 2.6
manual; more or less the same text appears in other versions:

	Trademarks, Copyrights, and Warranties
	--------------------------------------

	"Pretty Good Privacy", "Phil's Pretty Good Software", and the "Pretty
	Good" label for computer software and hardware products are all
	trademarks of Philip Zimmermann and Phil's Pretty Good Software.  PGP
	is (c) Copyright Philip R. Zimmermann, 1990-1994.  All rights

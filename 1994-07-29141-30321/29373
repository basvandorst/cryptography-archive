Well, I'm a native speaker of English, and the author of these words,
so let me try:

"not just the key" implies the attacker has the key, which usually
means he has already cracked the message (as the system--be it DES or
PGP or whatever--is usually already known).

"just not the key" is what I wrote. This means:

- attacker knows the system (DES, IDEA, RSA, etc.)

- attacker does not know the key, and is trying to find it

No, you still don't get it, we are talking about the keyspace, and why the 
NSA wanted to limit it to less than the 80 bit random number generated by 
the keystrokes and true random number generator.

You would seem to be injecting noise into this discussion.  Are you a 
kiblogist?:-)

Again, I think I would agree that they have admited that there are weak 
keys, like the weak keys for IDEA and DES, and that your interpritation is 
just plain wrong, as the set of all 80 bit keys is not weak in the sence you 
are talking about.

Roger.

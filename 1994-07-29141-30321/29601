Short version:  Can anyone offer informed comment on the strength of the
method used by PKZIP to 'validate' archives?  How reliable is this?

Long version:  If you register PKZIP, you can get a version that will include
some kind of validation check in the archives you make so that users can
verify that the archive hasn't been altered in any way.  Well, so they claim.
Personally, I'm suspicious.  I gather that their archive encryption scheme is
pretty feeble, and I'm wondering if their validation is any better.

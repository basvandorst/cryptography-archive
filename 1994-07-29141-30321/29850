I had seen some discussion on this in the sci.crypt archives from a year
or two ago.  Wasn't the point made that if short cycles were really a
problem, factoring would be easy?  If you choose your X0 as S*S for
some random S (so you know X0 is a quadratic residue) and get to a short
cycle so you come to X0 again, there would seem to be a good chance that
you will discover a different square root for X0 than S.  Knowing two
different square roots you can factor the modulus, as in the known-
cyphertext attack on Rabin decryption.  Hence you don't have to worry
about short cycles because if they exist your modulus can be factored
anyway.

I don't recall the resolution of this point.

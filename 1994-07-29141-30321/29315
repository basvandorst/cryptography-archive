It's a speed tradeoff.  MDC is a few times faster than IDEA, so SFS is
a few times faster than SecureDrive.  But MDC is less proven.

I agree.

I've seen the SFS source code and it passed my inspection, but why should
anyone trust my word?

Bugs are one possibility, but Peter describes the algorithms pretty
carefully in the docs; I think enough to spot security problems.  And
I discussed the design with Peter and am convinced of SFS's strength.
(I use it, if that's any evidence.)

I am in the same situation, so beware, I might be biased.

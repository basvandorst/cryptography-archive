There is no truth to the rumor that the list was shut down while it is
being investigated on charges of treason, sedition, espionage,
money-laundering, tax evasion, virus distribution, offshore data

Anti-State activities.

Toad.com is having problems, I hear. Last night I got a blast of a
hundred or so messages, so it may be putting out mail in fits and

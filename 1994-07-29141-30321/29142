| Hello,
| 
| This file includes 10 known and their encoded fromat.  You should
| use unix decode to decode this file then uncompress it and finally
| use tar to create a directory called temp with ten known and their
| encoded files.  I also included the unknown file once again.
| 
| Good luck this time

I haven't crack the code, but am I allowed to make a guess using other
statistics I observed? I think the unknown plain text is the article

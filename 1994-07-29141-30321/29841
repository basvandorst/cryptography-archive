Yes, it would be a deception if I claimed that Mr Zimmermann's different
attitudes toward trademarks and software patents by themselves proved
a charge of hypocrisy or self-serving unlawfulness.

But I don't. But it might very well be true that A == C in this case and that
Mr Zimmermann infringes or not based upon simple self-interest rather than
a love of civil liberty as he claims.

So if he could distinguish his motives from the vulgar motives suggested
by his actions toward PKP compared to his actions in protecting his
own trademarks, I would be most thankful.

My assumption, which I thought I stated (humm, well I did, but
you have to read between the lines quite a bit) , was that the
K1, K2 pair are used as session keys, chosen randomly for each
message, and thus one of the prerequisites for MA is violated.
I agree that no matter how fancy you get with composing
transpositons the result is still a transposition, and so with
multiple ciphertexts of the same length encrypted under the
same key will fall to MA.

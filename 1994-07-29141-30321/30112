Not quite. From the MIT license document

4. The software included in this compilation makes use of the
RSAREF(TM) Cryptographic Toolkit, use and distribution of which are
covered by the RSA Data Security, Inc., Program License Agreement
included in this compilation.  This compilation also contains
materials copyrighted by Philip Zimmermann under terms also included
in this compilation.  (See the "Legal Issues" section of the PGP
User's Guide, Volume 2.)  Users must also agree to the terms of both
of these licenses.


And I suspect that they would have been in severe problems with RSADSI
if they had just used Phil's code as well. Because of agreements they
signed, they are not free to do as they please even though they are a
coholder of the patent.

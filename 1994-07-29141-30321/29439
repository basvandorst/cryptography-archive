This raises the value of members of the bar way too high!  

Here in the Midwestern US (Ohio) anyone can give any legal advice they want 
to anyone else.  However, you can not charge fees for the advice unless you
have been admitted to the bar (ie. passed a test which has NEVER had any
questions about export regulations :)

The "You are not a lawyer" theme has been used frequently... But rational
discourse about topics involving the law would be impossible if Sternlight 
were correct.

Of course, rational discourse and ITARs do seem to be mutually exclusive :)

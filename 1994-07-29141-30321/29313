Thor Simon and David Sternlight each wrote about their opinions
regarding interpretation of certain parts of the law.  If what Thor
wrote should be classed as "legal advice", and should be punishable

David wrote?  If not, then please could somebody explain the essential
difference between Thor's and David's statements?

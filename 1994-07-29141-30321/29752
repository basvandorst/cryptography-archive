I'm not really up the RFD process, so I may be too late on this, but a
while ago I suggested the name "sci.crypt.moderated", and got positive
responses.  It also follows a common convention, and it avoids a
couple of problems, one being that it doesn't suggest non-technical
posts belong on sci.crypt.  We want the moderated group to deal with
the subjects with which sci.crypt is supposed to deal.

I'm not familiar with Lai.  Where did he get his Ph.D.?  Is a hardcopy of his thesis available?

<STS>

The book "On the Design and Security of Block Ciphers" by Xuejia Lai may be the sort of thing you
are looking for.  Lai received his Ph.D. from ETH in Switzerland.  The book contains a full description
of IDEA together with some "topping" and "tailing" chapters.

The ISBN is 3-89191-573-X
The ISSN is 0942-3044

It is Volume 1 of the ETH Series in Information Processing, Editor James L. Massey

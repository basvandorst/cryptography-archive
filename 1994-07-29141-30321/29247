Golly, Steve, I'm glad to see you haven't spoiled your perfect record of
being wrong when you criticize me.  :-)

What is standard procedure is for an expert committee to study something
requiring expertise. What that committee calling its findings those of the
parent body, without putting them to a vote of the members of that parent
body is called is misrepresentation.

Now THAT is pure bullshit. I did no such thing. I said that it was improper
for a special committee to represent its findings as the views of the entire
body, without ratification by that body.

Are you so bent on criticizing everything I post that you can no longer
think straight?

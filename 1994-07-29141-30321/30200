This is a no-brainer : because they have to pay the bills.

The need to demonize corporations like AT&T, Microsoft, and IBM, exists 
in *your* mind, and yours alone.  Having spoken with several members of 
EFF, the paradigm they operate in is "partners" not "enemies".  The 
strategy is to form coalitions to break the telecommunications jaggernaut.

If you have any evidence or arguments about specific incidents where EFF
sacrificed their public interest goals to satisfy corporate contributors,
then I'd like to hear them.

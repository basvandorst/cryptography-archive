Uh, isn't that one of the documented uses of PGP?  In actuality, there
is no intrinsic quality of "secret" or "public" inherent in either of
the keys except that one of them is password protected.  If you reverse
the situation (have the "public" key need a password), then someone who
steals your "secret" key (without the password) can send messages at
will.  

If you make it so that both keys have a password, you just have
conventional encryption.

The best scheme, IMHO, is to sign the messages with your secret key,
(proving it's from you) then encrypting with your recipient's 
public key (assuring you that only they can read it).  And if you
check the FAQ, those are the two main features of PGP;  privacy and
authentication.

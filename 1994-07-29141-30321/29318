Oh, poor David.

I'll mention again that you can feel _reasonably_ safe that unless whoever
obtains the disk for you is bloody stupid, he won't get caught.  Not that it
isn't against the law, and not that the NSA wouldn't love to see your friend
go away for a long time, but really, computer software is one of the easiest
things in the world to smuggle, and smuggling small non-chemically-active
things is not very difficult in any case.

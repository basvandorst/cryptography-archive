  Hi, I haven't posted here before and I hope some one on the cypher 
community can help me.

  In 1982 I picked up a book written by some people at an American 
University (in Michigan??) describing the efforts to decode 5 tables of 
coded characters left by the english occultist John Dee around 1550. The 
tablets were tables of alphabetical characters modified by small dots, or 
shifted within their boxes. After running theyr algorithms, they 
succeeded in deciphering the last four tablets by ignoring the first one 
which was just random info and the phrase 'here lies chaos'. The 
resulting text was a list of names of spirits, etc.

   I have forgotten the name of the book, and I can't find it.

   Could some one give me lead as to what the book was, or where I can 
find it?

   Thanks,       andrejs@crl.com

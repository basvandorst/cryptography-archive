Another deliberate smear by a propagandist. As he well knows, it is
according to the law, the State Department, and the U.S. Customs Service.
Phrasing it in the contentious way he does to get a cheap shot off at those
with whom he disagrees is contemptible.

I continue to be amazed that propaganists such as the writer have such
contempt for the intelligence and awareness of the readership that they
continue to post such stuff.

The values that define our common-sense world are under assault. Some have
taken to extremes the spurious notion of freedom without responsibility, and
are trying to tear down moral guardrails. Those who live on the shoulders
are told by their pals that they are in the middle of the road. Nothing is
wrong any more (except, of course, conservative thoughts and expressions).

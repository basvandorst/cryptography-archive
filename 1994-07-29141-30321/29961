I've seen this misstatement often enough (by several folk, David just
happened to be the poster this time) that I feel compelled
to comment:
  ... or [very?] wealthy companies or individuals who have felt
  it worth the expense of creating a DES keysearch machine for
  some purpose, and feel that your disk is worth the incremental
  cost of electricity and maintainence.

That is to say, it doesn't have to be *your* disk that was the
"high priority" item that prompted the expenditure for a keysearch
machine.  Once one is built it may as well be used, and if the
government, company, or individual who built it thinks your
data might be interesting they may as well make use of their
investment.

It is true that IBM does support strong crypto in HARDWARE on the OS/2. 
This exploits the export rules that tolerate stong crypto in hardware
where it is difficult to replicate.  On the other hand, they appear to
have given up trying to use or support strong crypto in software.  

For example, their new product, NetSP, competitive with kerberos, uses the
DES with 40 bit keys.  At least they have the good grace, not to say
integrity, not to call this encryption, but rather "data masking."

It should not surprise anyone, least of all the NSA, that some of the most
powerful and elegant crypto products are being developed by IBM
subsidiaries abroad.  The last time I was across the pond I saw an OS/2
access control package offered by IBM Netherlands and an OS/2 Key
Management Application offered by IBM Denmark.  While each of these will
be offered to other non-US IBM companies, they laughed when I asked if
they intended to offer them in the US. (My recent trips suggest that all
discussions involving both encryption and the US evoke at least smiles and
often "rolling in the aisles" laughter. )

While US banks lag the EC banks in the application of cryptography, the
Key Management package would find a good market here and might help us
catch up. On the other hand, since the most efficient attacks against
crypto systems are "black bag" attacks against key management, the kind of
rigorous and disciplined key management offered by this product would
likely have far more impact on  efficiency of attack and the security of
the system than the difference between 40 and 56 bit keys.

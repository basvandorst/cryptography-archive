Indeed they are, but in the context of free software on the net, I hope
this doesn't become a necessity. I wrote a shareware app. I haven't
trademarked 'nCrypt'. If I have to trademark it, patent the unique portions
of it's algorithms, copyright it, and retain lawyers year-round to retain
any kind of control over it, I'll have to re-think this business of
distributing crypto software.

When someone writes something and is kind enough to give it away, why mess
with it? All that's going to happen is that people are going to become very
leery of giving software away, especially with source.

This is of critical importance to crypto software, because gizmoids like
sci.crypt readers *want* source. Let's not make things tough by telling
authors, in effect, "hey, write your app, include the source, and then
everyone is going to make new versions, maybe even broken ones, and call
them the same thing."

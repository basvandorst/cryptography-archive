Plus a change...

I suppose it was too much to hope that you might have gotten
smarter in my absence, David.

But please, pray telll, given the, er, less than stringent
identification requirements of just about all of the non-
governmental or educational internet access providers, how
"nobody@shell.portal.com" is somehow intrinsically less
trustworthy than, say "phoenix@max.tiac.net."

Would you be more willing to respond to him if he were to
forge a more respectable-looking header, as any bozo with
a fistful of RFCs can do?

Give it up, David.  You're looking for personal authentication
in a medium which is intrinsically impersonal.  And there's
really no good reason to do so, unless you're fielding
death threats, which can be dealt with in other ways.

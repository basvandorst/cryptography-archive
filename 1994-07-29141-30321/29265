While this may not speak as to the security of the algorithms, I thought
people might find it interesting to see the results of timing tests
of SecureDrive vs SFS vs direct access (no security).

The test system is a 486DX-50 (not DX2), running a SCSI hard drive (SCSI
ID 0) and a Maxoptix Tahiti III (magneto-optical drive) (SCSI ID 1) in
"hard drive" mode, with 4megs of cache ram in the drive and write verify
turned on.  The Tahiti was using 600Meg, 512byte/sector media, and contained
the SecureDrive or SFS (or no encryption) disk.  DOS 5.0, with and without
HIMEM.SYS and SMARTDRIVE were tested:

   Hard drive to SecureDrive, HIMEM & Smartdrive, 152034K: 32:30.30
                                                  (77.95K/second)
   Hard drive to SecureDrive, no HIMEM/Smartdrive, 29033K: 6:15.80
                                                  (77.26K/second)
   SecureDrive to Hard drive, HIMEM & Smartdrive, 186774K: 27:18.37
                                                  (114.0K/second)
   SecureDrive to Hard drive, no HIMEM/Smartdrive, 29033K: 3:54.81
                                                  (123.64K/second)

   Hard drive to SFS486, HIMEM & Smartdrive, 152034K:  20:05.78
                                                    (126.09K/second)
   Hard drive to SFS486, no HIMEM/Smardrive, 29033K:  4:45.01
                                                    (101.87K/second)
   SFS486 to Hard drive, HIMEM & Smartdrive, 157740K: 18:19.28
                                                    (143.49K/second)
   SFS486 to Hard drive, no HIMEM/Smartdrive, 29033K: 3:03.67
                                                    (158.07K/second)

For comparison, with no security software handling the optical disk:
   Hard drive to optical drive, HIMEM & Smartdrive, 186774K: 18:40.26
                                                    (166.72K/second)
   Hard drive to optical drive, no HIMEM/Smartdrive, 29033K: 2:28.52
                                                    (195.48K/second)
   Optical drive to Hard drive, HIMEM & Smartdrive, 157740K: 11:50.57
                                                    (222.0K/second)
   Optical drive to Hard drive, no HIMEM/Smartdrive, 29033K: 1:54.13
                                                    (254.39K/second)

Both packages are approximately equal in terms of user interface, but
SFS seems to be quite a bit faster.  And comments from various people
(previous message thread) seems to indicate that it is more "secure"
as well.

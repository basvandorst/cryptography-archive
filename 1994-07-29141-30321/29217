David: This decision is not about what the _membership_ thinks, but
what the position of _an_expert_panel_ made up from ACM members thinks:
*a*big*difference*.

Big organizations like ACM have to operate in this manner: they
set up a committee to speak in representation of the whole organization.
It is an established practice; it is done all the time...

If big organizations had to submit every single decision like this to a
membership vote, they would not get anything done. In this particular
case, every single member would have had to obtain and read all the
information the panel used, a daunting task.

Let us just take this comparison one step further: we are all members
of a big nation that is making policy decisions right and left: are
they asking you (i. e. even polling the electorate) in order to make
a decision?

It was an _expert_committee_, and that makes all the difference. In fact,
that committee consisted of several people who also had a big vested
interest in this matter: in particular, I admire Dr. Denning's participation
in this matter.

Are you still a member of ACM? If you don't, you don't have any say as to
what happens in ACM.

What is really going on here is that we have to make the US more competitive
in this world of technological innovation, not less. In this sense, the
clipper chip, though it had great law enforcement capabilities, was not
a step in the right direction, because:
a) nobody overseas would have accepted it.
b) It stiffled competition and progress.

Make no mistake: the people overseas have all our crypto knowledge
and then some, since they are not crippled by a government who still
wants to spy on everybody's communications.

I ask you: given a choice between a communications technique that can
be broken by the US government, and one that can't, which one is a mafioso
going to choose?

I am a great admirer of Mr. Kelsey.  However, he knows a great deal more
about cryptography than he does about security.  

The security of a crypto mechanism has at least as much as to do with the
value and life of the data encrypted under a single key as it has to do
with the strength of the primitive mechanism used.  The cost of attack of
implementations of the DES are orders of magnitude stronger than the
primitive.  However, even if that were not so, the security would still be
a function of the value of the data.  Mr. McLaughlin is right.  In the
presence of modern automated key management, the effective length of the
key approaches the lenght of the data and the DES stands forever.  

Cryptanalysts have been telling us for centuries that attacks against the
system are orders of magnitude more efficient than attacks against the
primitive (see the Secrets of Ultra).  This is even more true when the
primitive is as strong as such modern ciphers as DES and IDEA.  That is
why security people have been spending their time and effort automating
the system (See Matyas and Meyers).

I do not care how low your estimate of the current cost of attack against
the DES. (Well, I do need them, so keep doing them.)  However, as long as
I know what it is, I can use the DES in a way that is secure for my
application.

Yep I tried to get this disk through a "front" in States. I don't get how
Bruce could find out that it indeed was a front. But anyway got
reply last week that I am not going to get this disk. Now then
if somebody in Europe (there must be few already) has this disk and
they want to supply me a copy - it is called piracy and Bruce is 
going to sue me? Or actually local authorities are going to sue me.

So the only legal way to get it (and now I am talking of the law of
FINLAND) is to buy it through a front in States. How big crime
this possible front person in States is conducting ? I mean
if he buys it for me? This whole legal situation of this crypto
law of USA is quite weird I would say the least. I bet it is going
to be rewoked.

Someone ready to take risk to become overrun by 
NSA car please contact with E-mail or better yet 
with telephone. But remember you are watched 
all the time...

I seen some comments on this area asking whether it is a 
good book or not. It is like asking is world round ?
It is GREAT book and everyone interested anything with
crypto and security should get it. I liked it clear presentation
of things because even I could understand it. Also it just 
doesn't describe the algorithms it gives like a quite good
total picture of the crypto. 

And for those who are not interested of crypto and security
buy the book and DO GET interested of crypto because
it might become very important for you in the time to
come.

Hopefulle there will be "Applied Cryptography PART TWO"

Opinions are only mine my employer does not have faintest idea of them
- I prefer keep it that way.

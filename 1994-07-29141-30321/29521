To the best of my knowledge, the ONLY case was the Miami trial of the
satelite descrambler exporters.  Hardly a good test case :)

I really liked the DOJ brief EFF dug up with a FOIA request.  In it the
DOJ doubted the legality of the ITARs application to crypto s/w export.

I think it is a bit limiting to believe that any law or regulation is
automatically legal until thrown out in court.  But, I admit, I would
not take the advice I once got (as a member of an elected public board
from our staff attny) "it isn't illegal until a man in a black robe
says it is" :)

If we are going to make this a philosophy of law discussion, let's
move it to misc.legal where I won't have to read it!

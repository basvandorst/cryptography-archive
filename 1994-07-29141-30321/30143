... to that problem he picked (or you both have agreed on).

This isn't perfect ZK, as in this case you don't know whether your friend
sent a real encrypted message (and thus knows the underlying plaintext)
or whether he sent a bitstring, which you 'decrypt' and send back under his
key (so he can get it) and thus providing him with plaintext/ciphertext pair
*with chosen ciphertext* = possibly providing him sone info on your private key.

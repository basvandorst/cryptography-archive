Submissions for posts to a research newsgroup are clearly academic
results which are normally published and therefor excluded from ITAR
control.

There has never been a problem posting crypto code from the US to
newsgroups.  We do it all the time; we have the right to do it; no one
seems to be trying to stop us from doing it.

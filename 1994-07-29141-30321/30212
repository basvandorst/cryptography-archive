Since I live in the US, I am covered by ITAR regulations which control 
export of munitions (of which crypto is considered one). I do not want to go 
into any of the implications thereof but would like an opinion so as to 
avoid even unintentional violation:

If I send a DES (or whatever) encrypted message to someone overseas, it is 
not considered a violation of ITAR if I do not provide the person at the 
other end with the means to decode it (other than a key). True or False ?

The same applies to PGP so long as I buy my copy from ViaCrypt or obtain it 
from MIT. Where the other guy gets his is not my concern so long as I do not 
send the software to him/her/other. True or False ?

Exchange of keys (not key generators) is not a violation of ITAR. True or 
False ?

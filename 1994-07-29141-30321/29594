In Europe, there is a collaborative project running to define the European 
digital compressed TV standard for satellite, cable and terrestrial use, 
based on MPEG-2 Transport Streams.

It's imaginatively called "DVB" for DIgital Video Broadcasting. They have 
defined a common scrambling algorithm for use with this system. Can I 
suggest you contact them at:

DVB Project Office
European Broadcasting Union
17a Ancienne Route
CH-1218 Grand Saconnex
Geneva
Switzerland

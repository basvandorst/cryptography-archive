So tell me why it is that something like 3 to 5
more messages of exactly the same length can't be 
collectively solved with multiple anagramming?

In such a case, all the letters end up transposed the
same offsets, so one can begin to line up columns of
text where each cipher letter is at the same offset,
and slowly and painfully build up a solution as per
the classic method.  What's different here?

What you want is something like a generalised hamming error-correcting
code (usually called an M-of-N code where M and N can be set arbitrarily,
eg an error correcting code that takes 8 bits of data and writes it out
in 12 bits of output and you can reconstruct the 8 bit data if you have
any 10-of-12, for instance)

I don't know if the posting below refers to one of these, but I saved
it at the time I saw it because it looked interesting.  Maybe it'll
have some relevance - do let us know! (The one below is a 6-of-8 code,
hence could be used to share a key between 8 people, requiring at least
6 of them to decode it)

You can also get shade from either
ftp.wimsey.bc.ca:/pub/crypto/software/dist/???????/Misc/shade.tar.gz
   and shade.patch.gz
or
ftp.dsi.unimi.it:/pub/security/crypt/code/shade.tar.gz

If you're outside the U.S. and Canada please use the Italian site.

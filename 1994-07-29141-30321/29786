I agree completely. But didn't Phil need to show Jim Bidzos of RSA Data
Security the same decency by licensing the patent, or at least using
due process to legally invalidate the RSA patent? Or are you saying
that these events are completely unrelated because one is a trademark
and one is a patent issue?

Or that, in general, if a person is too poor to afford to litigate that
he is thereby justified comitting civil disobediance or some other
unlawful action?

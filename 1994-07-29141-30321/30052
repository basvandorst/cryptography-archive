Not true.  SCSI drivers can be changed unless the disk is physically
write-locked or turned off.  Any SCSI device that is turned on will show
up on the bus, and can therefore be talked to.  That talking-to can
include replacing the driver the disk would normally use (perhaps with
one that doesn't include a functional password check).  I do basic driver
replacement quite often with syquest carts I get that have foreign (to my
systems) drivers installed.  My Macs are much more reliable if I don't
have multiple types of SCSI drivers hanging around in memory.

You have real security only if the partition of interest is encrypted
with a strong system, or the files on it are likewise protected.

The disk is not "hardware-nonexistent" unless it is off or disconnected
from the computer.  Having the driver that is loaded by default when the
Mac is booted refuse access without the password is no protection if you
replace or neutralize that driver.

This Mac expert wouldn't touch it with a 10 foot pole. :-)  Give me
Curve Encrypt instead for now.  Curve's not all that hard to port to
PowerPC native code, either (I'm almost done, honest...).

I thought the free pursuit of ideas was central to what all these WWII folk
were fighting for.  Banishment of secure crypto is not essential to national
security...the bad guys already have it.  But it's banishment is essential
to the maintenance of this vast multi billion dollar bureaucracy which is
increasingly turning it's focus onto US citizens.

I am somewhat disturbed that some would believe anything discussed in
sci.crypt could be supressed because the ideas 'fall under the "essential
to national security" moniker'.

Oh well, if we weren't discussing the essential lifeblood of sci.crypt, I 
would suggest we take this to talk.politics.crypto.

You know, if this keeps up, people will soon be claiming font selection should
be regulated as 'essential to national security' ;)

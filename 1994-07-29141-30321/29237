Don't think I haven't thought about it.

Cryptography and cryptanalysis are two faces of the same discipline; I
think it is impossible to study one without learning the other.  I don't
think you can really write a book about modern cryptanalysis (for classical
cryptanalysis I don't think it is possible to write a better book then
Helen Gaines).  In my dream second edition, I want to discuss differential
and linear cryptanalsys in more detail, and spend half a chapter on the
theory of block cipher design.  The theory will necessarily have to discuss
cryptanalysis.  The problem with focusing on cryptanalysis is that each
individual instance is different.

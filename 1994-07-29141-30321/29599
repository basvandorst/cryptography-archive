Not merely one suggestion, but three:

  (1) ALWAYS include version numbers when making a bug report.

  (2) Use the bug-reporting address(es) listed rather prominently
      in the documentation and/or sources, rather than a global
      newsgroup (in this case:  zip-bugs@wkuvx1.wku.edu).

  (3) Get an up-to-date version of the source code.  All recent
      versions of Info-ZIP software--including the zcrypt package--
      include a file "Where" with an extensive list of ftp and non-
      ftp sites (as well as the program version numbers which were
      current at the time of release).  Our home site is ftp.uu.net
      in /pub/archiving/zip; current versions are:  zip 2.0.1, unzip 
      5.1 (soon to be 5.11), and zcrypt 2.1 (soon to be 2.2).

Note that archie is utterly useless for finding current versions
of unzip and a number of other packages, too.  Most of the hits it
returns are three years out of date.

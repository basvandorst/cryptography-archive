   Er, uh, if you'll pardon me for interrupting this important exchange
with something tenuously related to cryptography, I can point out that
anyone with PGP, RIPEM, or some similar digital-signature-capable
software can establish a reputation and continuity of identity across
any number of multiple anonymous ids, etc.  Just come up with a public/
private key pair, and post your public key with each message you send,
and sign each message you send.  That way, you can maintain some kind of
pseudonym and the best anonymity you can achieve on the net, and still
build up a reputation as someone who usually posts well-thought-out
things.

err... no.. the escrow is not there because the encryption is
*so* strong, the escrow is there to allow gov't spying (or court
authorized wire taps if you prefer).  One would hope that the
encryption is *so* strong, but we don't know this for certain. 
The NSA's record would indicate it probably is, IMHO.

This makes no sense.. RSA did not design Skipjack, the NSA did. 
The only way in which they "crippled" skipjack was with key
escrow.  i.e. to design a "crippled" commercial algorithm, take
any strong algorithm and escrow the keys..  pretty simple.

The "bug" or fact of life, as reported has little to do with
skipjack.  The weakness lies in public key crypto key management
- - the users on either end of the phone call have no way of
verifying that someone is spoofing the conversation with the
aforementioned black box.  You can do this with RSA or any other
public key algorithm.  Skipjack is not a public key algorithm
and could not in any way be designed so as to prevent spoofing.

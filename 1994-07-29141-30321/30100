If you have followed them more closely, you would have noticed that
most of them complain about *your* drivel and not about the rare and
informative messages from EFF.

Yup, you are still violating this wish and posting drivel here.

Here is an opportunity for you: get a clue. The message was
cross-posted, which means that we have seen it only in ONE of all
those newsgroups. Once it is read there, you don't see it anywhere
else.

I would say the same about *your* post. Also, unlike your post, the
message from EFF was at least interesting and informative.

You've been lucky. I, at his place, wouldn't be that polite. If you
don't like his messages in this newsgroup - just killfile him. It's
not like all EFF members are posting here from different accounts...

Follow-ups redirected to more appropriate places.

They are, indeed.

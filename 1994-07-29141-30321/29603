Added by the user, or added automatically by the service?

That you find the *appearance* of normalcy preferable to a *surety*
of anonymity speaks volumes about your personality, David.

This is not a bank, David, and anon666@foo.bar.biz is not likely to
point a gun at you.  The worst they can do is say something nasty
to you, or on a bad day sendsys-bomb you, and you of all people should
know that possession of a "verifiable" address is not likely to
prevent them from verbally abusing you. :)

But look.  It's a free net (or at least just a small monthly fee).  If 
you want to arbitrarily decide that some 17-year old moron with
a verifiable account at an .edu site is by definition more worthy
of your attentions than a literate adult who happens to use an
anonymous remailer - be my guest.  But please don't pretend that
the distinction is anything but an arbitrary one on your part.

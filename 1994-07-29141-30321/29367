Hi Folks,

I have a need for a fast message digest algorithm (about ten times
faster than MD4 would be good).

Whilst I would obviously like a cryptographically sound algorithm,
for my current needs speed is more of a consideration than an
ability to withstand a serious attack.

An algorithm which has withstood serious (but not definitive)
scrutiny, or one for which the best known attack is known to be
quite difficult would be ideal.

Are there any (unencumbered) candidates for this?

I've was also re-reading Bruce Schneier's article in Dr. Dobb's
Journal with this in mind, and was wondering about the status of
some of the fast algorithms mentioned there - do any of these
encrypt faster than MD4 digests?  Are any of the algorithms
mentioned there (other than Blowfish and the Shrinking Generator)
available on the net (non-USA) or in print - the proceedings are
not available yet I gather.

If you follow, can you please also send me mail, as our newsfeed
has been temperamental recently.

Cheers, Dieter.

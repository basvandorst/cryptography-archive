There are some examples of this in "Codebreakers", OUP, ISBN
0-19-820327-6 which is a collection of short essays by people
involved in the operations at Bletchley Park, England during WW2.
The book is mainly non-technical, but does describe some of the
analysis used to give "cribs" for Enigma, Fish and japanese cyphers.

Although Paul would be a good moderator, having shown himself polite and
pretty flame-free as well as knowledgeable, why "must" the moderator live
outside the U.S.? And what's wrong with Steve Bellovin or Bruce Schneier as
possible co-moderators if the work load is to be shared, assuming they'd be
willing?

The idea is to keep the group to the sci of crypt, and to filter out flames
and other inappropriate rudeness. There's no reason anyone both competent in
the art and with (ahem) a proven record of not flaming his fellow man isn't
a suitable moderator.

I must say your remark seems to me to be a good illustration of why the
group needs moderators. Though seemingly innocuous in tone, it seems quite
offensive to some and has nothing to do with focussing the group on the sci
of crypt unless I very badly misunderstand it.

are told by their pals that they are in the middle of the road. Nothing is
wrong any more (except, of course, conservative thoughts and expressions).

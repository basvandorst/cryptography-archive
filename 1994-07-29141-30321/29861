Actually, writing PGP *IS* a violation of the patent.  At a recent
conference, I spent some time talking with one of the principal trial lawyer 
for STAC in the STAC vs. Microsoft lawsuit (Wayne Barsky --- certainly an 
expert in the legal area of intellectual property), and here's what I 
learned:

In the Constitution, Congress is granted the power to "promote the
Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to
Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and
Discoveries."   Note the word "exclusive" there...

This is further expanded on by the patent office which says that patents
give the owner the right to exclude others from making, selling, or using
the subject matter of their invention.  In other words, without permission
from RSA, Inc., you are violating their patent by the process of writing
a program that uses RSA, even if it doesn't go beyond the "experimental
stage".

Now I had always heard the tale that "experimental use" was excluded from
patent protection, and when I asked Barsky about this, he said he wasn't
aware of any such exclusion.  When I asked if I could be considered
infringing by writing a program using a patented algorithm for my own
personal use, he said yes.  However, he also said that there is a "practical"
side of infringing --- if the company doesn't think they'll get enough
damages out of a lawsuit to justify suing for infringement, then they
won't sue, and for "practical" purposes, you're safe.

Bottom line:  Phil Zimmerman did violate RSA, Inc.'s patent simply by
writing PGP.  It doesn't matter what happened after that, except for
determining damages if RSA Inc decided to sue.

Disclaimer:  I'm not a lawyer, and don't play one on TV.

Further:  To Grady:  I don't have any problem with someone seeing one
type of law as worthy of civil disobedience (patents on algorithms) and
another type of law as just (trademark protection).  I don't see any
hypocrisy on Zimmerman's part....

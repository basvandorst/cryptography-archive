How could the bad guys find out if you do it properly. Use a brand new
diskette, wear gloves :=), put the stuff encrypted with the recipients
public key on the diskette, and stuff it in a brand new envelope. Put the
thing in a mailbox in one of the Mega cities, preferably far from where you
live. Be sure to buy everything also far away and don't wet the stamp with
your saliva. It will cost them a lot of effort to detect who did it, even
more to prove it.

IN´Where can I find the version of PGP that is available as shareware? (This is 
IN´correct right?) If not where can I buy it... please email back.

IN´nhayes@interaccess.com

Try one of the following:

nic.funet.fi (pub/unix/security/crypt)
ghost.dsi.unimi.it (pub/security)
src.doc.ic.ac.uk (computing/security/PGP)
net-dist.mit.edu (look in /pub/PGP for instructions)

You are looking for PGP26.ZIP (if you live in the US and have an MS-DOS
computer) or PGP26ui.ZIP (if you live anywhere else and have an MS-DOS
computer).  The last address is the 'legal' place to get the US version.
You have to FTP to the site, go to /pub/PGP, read the README file for
instructions on how to proceed.  Good luck.

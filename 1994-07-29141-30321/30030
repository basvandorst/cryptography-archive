It looks like some sort of double transposition.  Thanks to an embarrassing
post I made, I learned that these are indeed solvable.

In the worst case, these are solved as you would expect, by anagramming.
As incredible as it may seem, there are people skilled enough to anagram
fairly long sequences of jumbled letters.  (I don't think I'm one of
them).  These folks get the plaintext, but not necessarily the key.  There
are ways of testing for the correctness of the key.

See Joseph Courville's Manual for Cryptanalysis of the Columnar Double
Transposition Cipher.  It's not exactly a widely available publication,
but you can get it from the author, a member of the ACA.

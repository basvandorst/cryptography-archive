Not according to Helen Gaines's book _Cryptanalysis_ or the American 
Cryptogram Assoc. They say:

1. Fill a 5x5 array with the alphabet, treating I and J as equivalent.
Normal or keyed order are both possible.
Normal order gives

   1   2   3   4   5
1  A   B   C   D   E
2  F   G   H  IJ   K
...
5  V   W   X   Y   Z

Now encrypt each letter as its row coordinate followed by its column
coordinate, so A=11,B=12,...E=15,F=21, ... Z=25. 

Most of the remainder of your posting seems to vary between their
definition and yours.  The trailing digit attack is for Nihilist
(Gaines's definition) and the max summand attack is for the 1-26 system.

: 2. Select a numeric key of some length containing numbers from 1 to 26.
Coordinates are also used in this step by Gaines.

: 3. Repeat the key iteratively under the pt and sum them.  This is the CT.
The sum is mod 100 in Gaines. With the 1 to 26 definition mod 100 is a 
no-op.

Gaines presents both versions in her chapter "Some Periodic Number-Ciphers"
but only the coordinate method is called "Nihilist".

No need to blame individuals; we've been discussiing moderation since
well before Clipper came out, and some approaches to the problem  have
been the creation of talk.politics.crypto and alt.privacy.clipper.

Moderated groups, if anyone's seriously willing to do the work,
are another method, but none of the orgainzing efforts have suceeded yet.
The cypherpunks mailing list has been another alternative.

The normal way to do moderation is to send all articles to the moderator/s,
who posts any approved articles.  An alternative, which is clumsier,
but is quite ITAR-safe, is to have people post normally and have
the moderator cancel articles after the fact.  (Technically, the news
software doesn't let you do it, but forged cancels aren't tough.)

That does cast the moderator more as a censor than an organizer,
and non-approved articles may hang around a day or so before being
noticed by the moderator, but it does eliminate delays and
moderator-on-vacation problems as well as avoiding ITAR.
And multiple moderators are simple to implement.

Not sure if I like the idea, but it's one approach.

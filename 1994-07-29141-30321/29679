Hmmmm.... are you saying that the name "Pretty Good Privacy" and "PGP" 
are trademarked by Phil Zimmerman?  I would have to check the PGP docs,
because I don't remember off the top of my head.  Isn't it trademarks, not
copyrights, that protect product names?  "CocaCola" is a trademark, not a
copyright, correct?

Aren't all car manufacturer names and model names trademarked?  Isn't 
that what protects the companies from others selling cars under their 
banner?

   What ever happened to the thread about Sternlight being some sort of
complex program that automatically responds to certain posts.  I've heard
of PERL-scripts doing things similar to this--not that I would use perl :)
He has the exact same tone in every posting, and never misspells anything.
Ok, I got an idea (and some free time on my hands).  I'll set up something
to spell check ALL of Sternlights posts and then I'll send out the results
after about 2 weeks.  
   A personal question to Sternlight:  Did you really mean to piss some of
us off?  That's lame, big-ugly lame!

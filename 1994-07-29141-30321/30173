Sure, I'll bet that M. Blase, if he really wrote this,  gets paid by AT&T to do things to piss off
the government.  Sure thing.  COME ON!

I'll bet that there are no escrow ''features'' either

I find it increadable that anyone here still believes that Clipper, Inc.
(aka AT&T) would let any kind of strong crypto out to the net.  There has
to be a back door to let uncle Sam in.  We're talking about AT&T here.
They are motivated by $$$.

Why is are these few so fast to defend this?  Who do they work for?

Before you tell me to look for myself, I asked for it and was told I
couldn't have it through the anon.penet server.  Why do you suppose?
This was over six months ago, in february.  Has anyone actually received this code? 

I'll stick with PGP: version 2.3.

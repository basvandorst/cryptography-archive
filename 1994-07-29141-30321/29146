I don't think that padrote (why doesn't anyone on Delphi let us know
what his/her real name is?) understands the purpose of moderation.  

Moderation will not exclude articles from newcomers.  It will not exclude
trivial questions.  It will not exclude unpopular theories and opinions.
The purpose of moderation is to exclude postings that are not on
topic; that is, postings that are not about cryptology.  Moderation
will also exclude questions which are better answered by pointing the 
questioner to the FAQ; if the questioner wants more information, [s]he
will not be prevented from asking.

An example of how well this works may be found in 
alt.atheism.moderated.  We would be well advised to look at that group's
charter for inspiration.

Andrew.

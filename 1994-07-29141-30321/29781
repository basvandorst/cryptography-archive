Does anyone know anything about the products CITADEL and ULTRASECURE
for the macintosh, or any other drive protection program using DES or
some other secure, non-proprietary algorith?

I want to get such a program for my macintosh, but after reading about
Norton's Diskreet and how easy it is to break the protection, I want 
to make sure the program I get is secure. MacWorld had an article by
a guy who wrote a book called Cryptography in C, and he tried to break
various protection programs for the mac. For example, he said one program
was not good because it includes the DES key along with the encrypted 
file, and he mentioned that the implementation of DES in CITADEL was
a better implementation than in ULTRASECURE. Does anyone know anything else
about these programs?

Thanks

Tom

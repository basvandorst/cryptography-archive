You're pretty much on-target with that last sentence.  Most people seem to
think (many lawyers I've talked to among them) that ITAR is unconstitutional
and will get struck down once some poor sap finally becomes the test case.

The problem is, essentially, that nobody wants to be that test case, leaving
the Government's forces of coercion squarely in command of the field.

If you get a front person to get the disk to you, and that person is arrested
and charged, and that person fights the law in court, that person will
probably not go to jail, and will probably be responsible for the law getting
torn up by the judiciary.  Unfortunately, I doubt you will find anyone who
wants to incur the likely expense of the court proceedings involved.

Damn' shame the government doesn't have to pay court costs if they lose on
Constitutional grounds, isn't it?  I've always thought that to be the most
glaring omission from the Bill Of Rights.  It's unobvious, but IMHO necessary;
elsewise, the legislature and Executive Branch can avoid the system of checks
and balances in most cases by making it prohibitively expensive to fight them
in court...

Luckily, the overwhelming odds are that if you do get someone to send you a
copy of that disk, he will never get caught at all.

The private key is completly symmetric to the public one in RSA.
Hence, your idea reduces to publishing the public key only to a
group of people rather than the whole world.

You have re-invented the idea of "digital signitures" - encrypting 
with your own private key, so anyone can decrypt it with your public
key, and autenticate you identity.

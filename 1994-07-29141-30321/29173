Ironically, the cumulative reading effort spent on reading the
arguments pro and con for moderation will *far exceed* the effort
needed to press "Delete" or "Skip" in one's newsreader.

I've been involved in several moderated groups and find no real
advantages (most moderators pass most messages, fearing charges of
censorship) and several disadvantages, including long delays, interval
of no posts followed by a large batch of posts, etc.

And the moderation issue also raises legal and export issues. It's
even conceivable--albeit unlikely--that authorities in the moderator's
country, be it the U.K. or Saudi Arabia or wherever, could ask to
screen submitted items before they are distributed. An unmoderated
newsgroup seems much more consistent with the spirit of cryptography.

There are already at least four groups devoted to some aspect of crypto
(this group, talk.politics.crypto, and the clipper and pgp groups),
not even counting the security and RISKs groups. And don't forget the
legal and EFF/CPSR groups, where crypto also comes up frequently.

What people ought to do is to not respond to political or legal points
made in sci.crypt! (I post nearly all of my legal/political stuff
where it belongs, in talk.politics.crypto.)

The last thing needed is yet another crypto group.

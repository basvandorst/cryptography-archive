They are actually available anywhere in the world where there's an
Internet or Fidonet connection.  And the Where file in UnZip 5.1 is
later than that in Zip 2.0.1; zcrypt21.zip is the current, to be 
superseded by zcrypt22 in a week or so.  (No changes to the actual 
crypt code, just portability things and a different filename.)

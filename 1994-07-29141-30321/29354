I see a small problem with this: the dummy pads which they hand over to
the Inquisition just happened to run out with the last message exchange.
To the bit. For page-long messages that's in the neighborhood of a
one-in-a-thousand coincidence, which is more than any torturer should be
asked to believe. And if they want to pad the pads (sorry) with a few
thousand extra bits to lend credibility, they're back to the pad-exchange
problem.

	Also, if the police sieze your computer files, they're likely to
find your real encryption/compression routines, and then good luck
convincing them that you were actually using OTP's the whole time.

	Actually, these two problems could solve each other with a little
effort: convert the programs to self-decrypting files and use them to
pad the phony OTP. But that's getting a little silly.

	Of course, you could just exchange fresh keys before every message,
and destroy them as soon as they'd been used. That wouldn't allow you to
give false information to your interrogators, but it would ensure that 
you would be _unable_ to give them the real information no matter what
they did. (One hopes that they would be smart enough to figure that out
early.)

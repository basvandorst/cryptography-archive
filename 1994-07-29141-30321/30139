I was away.. I had no idea the ruckas I had stirred up by
suggesting that applying two algorithms might not increase
security and could weaken it.

You state this very eloquently here, and is more or less what I
had in mind.

So much work in the field assumes *nothing*, operating under the
worst case (i.e. chosen-plaintext/chosen key attacks etc), it
seems silly to blow this all out the window by saying, "Yeah,
well, what are the chances DES and IDEA on top of each other
will do something nasty?"  I think assumptions like these are
rather dangerous in a field that assumes so little else.

We make assumptions in implementations, I think - we assume that
no major factoring breakthrough will be made in the next little
while, so we build hardware & software implementing RSA.

This is different, I think, from designing a cipher, which is
what you are doing by layering several different base ciphers.
You wouldn't design a cipher assuming, "Well, I mean - they
*probably* won't tap *your* line.."

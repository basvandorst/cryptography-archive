see `A Bulk Data Encryption Algorithm'' DH Wheeler, in 
`Fast Software Encryption' (ed R Anderson), Springer
Lecture Notes in Computer Science v 809 pp  127 - 134.
This algorithm is public domain, and the article even has 
source code.

They were published about two weeks ago as the volume cited 
above. Check out your local bookstore or Springer office,

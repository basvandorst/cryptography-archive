There pretty obviously isn't.

Or rather, if the algorithm is completely unconstrained,
knowning the bits in key has zero information value relative
to determining the algorithm.  This is because one could
apply any one-to-one mapping function to the key prior
to using it, and construct an equally valid candidate for
the algorithm with a completely different key.

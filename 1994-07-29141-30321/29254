%House to withdraw the controversial "Clipper Chip" encryption
%proposal.  Noting that the "security and privacy of electronic
%communications are vital to the development of national and

It says left and right that this is the finding of an ACM

the U.S. Public Policy Committee of the ACM -- throughout.

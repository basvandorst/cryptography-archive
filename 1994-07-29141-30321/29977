	I remember a post a few weeks ago on a potential bug in the 
clipper system.  The poster was asking if it was possible to "Plug" a 
device inline between two clipper devices that itself contained two 
clipper chips.  The devices on the line would actually be "talking" to 
the chips in the box and the data stream between the two chips would be 
"plaintext."
	I don't recall seeing any followups on this, but I was gone for a 
week or so.
	Any comments?

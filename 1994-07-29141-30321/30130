False. MIT has a license from RSADSI for RSAREF. It would be good if you did
such elementary things as reading the documentation before posting the usual
positive and wrong information we get from you.

False. Not only have you not been reading the documentation, you appear not
to have read the posts here by MIT and Zimmermann.

Since we've established that you don't know what you are talking about, you

The values that define our common-sense world are under assault. Some have
taken to extremes the spurious notion of freedom without responsibility, and
are trying to tear down moral guardrails. Those who live on the shoulders
are told by their pals that they are in the middle of the road. Nothing is
wrong any more (except, of course, conservative thoughts and expressions).

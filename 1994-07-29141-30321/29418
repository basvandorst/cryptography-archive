There is no need to send the password over the net in clear text.
It would be trivial for the client to encrypt it (using crypt, of
course) before sending it.  Then the server just has to do a find
and replace (perl is built for stuff like this) on the password file.

Besides, only an idiot uses important passwords (like for their UNIX
account) for netrek.  And if you can't remember two passwords, you
are simply lame.

I agree it would be nice to be able to change your password, and
nice not to let other people see them, but face it... has anyone
out there ever been _password_ scummed?  I mean, just add a couple
of spaces if you want to name scum.  Its a lot easier than running
a crypt breaker or packet sniffer...

He meant trademark.  Most people get this wrong.  At a meeting of the ABA's
section on Patents, Trademarks and Copyrights, someone once said, "When I
tell a general practitioner that I am copyright lawyer, he immediately
correct me: 'You mean patents!'  He then says: 'Well, anyway, as a patent
lawyer, you can copyright a name for me can't you?'"

I too support the idea.  (I would like to get all of you crypto
techie noise generators out of here.)  The proposal is not new and
has always foundered over the problem of the moderator.  I nominate

I suggest that it is time for some ambitious graduate student who
would like to make a name for herself to ask ACM for a grant.

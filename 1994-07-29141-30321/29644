Of course, the uuencoding doesn't add anything, analytically.

What it _does_ add is an appearance of normality.  It is well known
that uuencoding is needed to ensure you can pass around stuff with
bytes in it around the net.  So, "use the standard".

Now, after the government uudecodes, then what?  I presume one is
smart enough to make the result look like an .EXE MSDOS file or
a .out UNIX file or a .GIF file or whatever.

Keep in mind that a respectable percentage of the uudecodes _my_
software has tried have failed.  There is a surprising amount of
fuzz in the spec; enough that things break down.  What do you do
then?  Sometimes, I've been able to manually correct them, but other
times, I've given up in despair.  I suppose the gov't would be more
dogged than I, but I assure you it is a dreary task to fix up messed
up uuencodings so that one can confirm there's nothing "secret" in it.

Even if it doesn't break down, now you merely have maybe 30 MB
a day of stuff to analyse, most of which are pictures of Cindy
Crawford or Babe of the Month, but how does a _program_ detect that
so that one doesn't have to waste manpower on having government
employees viewing Internet soft porn (I'd love to have to explain 
that, even in closed session, to Jesse Helms :-) ).

To be sure, security by obscurity fails at the margins, but if the
goal is to not be detected encrypting in the first place, it is a
reasonable way to go if you don't think your internet address is
set for maximum scrutiny by the Feds.  Anyone playing this game has
to assume that one's encryption may be found anyway, but the point is;
why give away the fact you're encrypting for free, esp. if you
have to process it to fit through the net anyhow.

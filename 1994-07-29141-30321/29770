Yes, codes can easily be imbedded in plaintext. What I want to know
is, is it easy to imbed cipher-text in plaintext ?
In particular, is there an easy way to make the plaintext look completely
innocent ? Other posters have pointed out that steganography in 
plaintext can look very stilted. Is there an easy way round this ?

Thanks,

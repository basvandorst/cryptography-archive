As I recall, they objected to the code being in separate files for
each routine.  They claimed that it was therefore not exactly the same
as the book.

They clearly wanted to say that magnetic/electronic media does not
carry the same freedoms as ink on paper, but since they don't have any
precedent for this they have to bring up other issues.  They did note
that the files could easily be compiled, but avoided bringing up the
media as the cause for their decision.

You could concatenate all the files into one, but then I suppose they
could argue that the book has the page number and the chapter title or
routine name at the top of every page, so you would have to write
something like:

[...]
    printf("\nrounds %d:    ", j+1);
    if (j==rounds)

526                                                 Source Code

      for(i=0; i<4; i++)
                printf(" %6u", Z[j*6+i]);
[...]

to really make it the same as the book.


I wonder where they draw the line.

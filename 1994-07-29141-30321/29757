Nope.

I happened to do a little performance test on the triple-DES code in RSAREF
on a couple of platforms.

My favorite was a 66 MHz 486 running CMU Mach.  I got encryption rates of
8.9 usec per byte (if I remember correctly) or 112 KB/sec (B = byte).
Since even uncompressed audio on a workstation is <= 8KB/sec,
there's plenty of power on even a slow processor to encrypt voice.

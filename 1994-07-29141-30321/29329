Well, it's fairly easy to create a RHS file which contains it's track/sector
location stored (encrypted) within it.  If the company in question is nice
when people call to re-install their software if it needs reinstalling (e.g.
after a hard drive crash) there isn't necessarily too big a problem (also
provided that if the company goes out of business they release publicly a
"back-door" disk so users of the software can reinstall whenever needed).
Even if the company were always willing to instantly give the registration
pasword needed for a particular machine without overly much hassle (just get
name, phone number, address) I doubt if too many pirates would want to press
their luck.

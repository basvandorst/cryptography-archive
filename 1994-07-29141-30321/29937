Hello fellow Macintosh users,

If you are looking for MacPGP, the latest and (in my opinion) the best
version of PGP available is MacPGP 2.6ui v1.2. 

MacPGP 2.6ui is fully compatible with MIT's MacPGP 2.6, but offers several
advantages, a chief one being that MacPGP 2.6ui is controllable via
AppleScript.  This is a very powerful feature, and pre-written
AppleScripts are already available.  A set of AppleScripts called the
Interim Macintosh PGP Interface (IMPI) support encryption, decryption, and
signing of files via drag-n-drop, finder selection, the clipboard, all
accessible from a system-wide menu.  Eudora AppleScripts also exist to
interface MacPGP with the mail program Eudora. 

MacPGP 2.6ui v1.2 is available via anonymous ftp from:

In the case of U.S. ftp sites, you will need to read the README file there
for more specific directions on how to obtain the files.  Please follow
all relevant export regulations. 


Commercial Users 
----------------
Mac users who wish to use PGP for commercial use are out of luck: 
ViaCrypt has still not released their version of MacPGP.  According to the
company, they are expecting to release it in 4-6 weeks.  The program
itself will be essentially identical to MIT's MacPGP 2.6, but with a
license allowing its commercial use. 


New Users
---------
If you are totally lost as to what to do once you obtain MacPGP, there is
a MacPGP "Frequently Asked Questions" document available via anonymous ftp
from:

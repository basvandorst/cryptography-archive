     Hold on just one second there Grady! "the most secure cryptography 
program on the face of the planet"???!?!?!??
	I agree that PGP is near the top of the list, but I KNOW that a 
program which employs a one time pad is better, and I sincerely believe 
that the NSA has something better than PGP. (It *is* after all, only as 
good as IDEA.)

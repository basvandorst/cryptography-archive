As a Canadian (rather ignorant of the laws of my land), I have to ask this.

I can legally acquire Bruce's disk.  Are there CANADIAN laws which prevent
me from taking his source-code (or the resulting executables) elsewhere on
this benighted planet of ours?  If not, there would seem to be a rather large
hole in this entire issue (about 3.5 million square miles :-) )

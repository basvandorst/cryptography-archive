As I recall, a fair amount of intelligence about the German military was
derived from traffic analysis early in WWII before much Enigma traffic
was being cracked.  I've read several books about Enigma/Ultra in the
past few months, but by notes don't remind me which book discussed it.
I think it may have been Gordon Welchman's _Hut 6 Story_, as I think
Welchman may have been involved in the traffic analysis effort before he
got so deep in Enigma itself.  Anyone have the books handy or have a
better recollection on this?

Regards, Brent

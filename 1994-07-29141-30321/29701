Tom:
	Phil Zimmermann released PGP.  The program is his work, and the name
is his by copyright.  He does not dissuade you from making your own changes.  He
(and I) disagree with you *only* in that you make your own changes but send this
modiifed software out *AS* PGP.  With your changes, it is No Longer PGP.  I
suggest you ask him if it would be alright to send this modified program out as 
"Tom's privacy program (copyleft), based upon PGP".  This would let you tinker
and leave Phil's reputation out of it.  (If you screw up this program that is
still called "PGP", it isn't your reputation that people will think about when
they hear "PGP sucks".  No offense meant, but you're risking his good name, not 
yours.)

Jerry.

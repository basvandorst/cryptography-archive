I know that PGP is currently the most secure program available, but it 
doesn't easily fit my needs.  I need a secure virtual disk drive that can 
withstand FBI level attacks, thus far I have found Norton's Disreet to be 
close to useless, and the two I don't know much about they are SFS and 
Secure Drive (or device).  Now I don't know which of the two I am going 
to use as of yet and the replies to this post will determine this.

(I don't know if THE NSA will be attacking this device but I would like 
to make things as difficult as possible.)

why is it that a man at 18, such as I, is old enough to go to prision, 
die in war for country, and vote for the next fool who sends us to die, 
cannot go to a crowded room filled with smoke and pick up a lousy beer?

   There is a fully worked example in _The American Black Chamber_ (by
Herbert O. Yardley, of course).  The particular message involved was
taken from a German spy entering the US from Mexico on a Russian
passport.  Captain Yardley (during WWI) had to solve it by anagraming
AND have a convincing case to allow the spy to be held.  (The message
was in German with a few Spanish/Mexican words.)

   Yardley may have had his personality flaws, but he wrote some good
books.  If you haven't seen _The Education of a Poker Player_ and can
get a copy, by all means do so.  But don't take the stories too
literally.

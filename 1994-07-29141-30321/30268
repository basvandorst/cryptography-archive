After a number of glitches and delays in production, the Network and 
Internetwork Security book is in stock, and will ship next week. I have 
received a copy and fortunately, only a few, nonfatal errors survived the 
correction process; an errata list is attached. I would be most grateful to 
anyone who notifies me of other errors.

The book has a list price of $41.25. There is still a problem ordering it 
directly from the publisher, so if you want a copy your best bet is to order 
through a technical bookstore. FYI, a Table of Contents is attached.

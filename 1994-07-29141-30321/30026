Carefull here, the making of a settlement does not imply an admission of guilt
or otherwise by either of the parties unless such an admission forms a part
of the settlement. All that can be aduced from a settlement is that the parties
consider it to be in their commercial interests to make one. 

People should also be very carefull of using words like "criminal" in what is
a civil matter. 

There is no practical point in persuing an RSA case at this stage. By the time
the case came to court it would be 97 and the original Diffie-Helleman et al.
patent would be bust. The year 2000 is only for the RSA patent which is not
the only way to do public key. Does anyone know offhand when the El Gammal 
patent expireth?

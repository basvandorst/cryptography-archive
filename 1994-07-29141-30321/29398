   1.  Is it possible to use a message digest to verify that your
   keys have not been tampered with?  Then you could just check the
   signature of your keyrings when you logged on.

Sure.  You can use PGP to verify your keyring, and using the
web-of-trust, you can then have it verify your signatures all the keys
that you signed, and recurse through your circle-of-friends.  To
verify that your own key was not munged, you can sign something with
your secret key and then try to verify it.  This will ensure that your
public key wasn't munged.

I should add that this will not check the *whole* keyring, but only
those keys which are in your circle-of-friends.  This circle may be a
few as 1 (if you never signed anyone's keys) or as many as 5300 (the
approximate number of keys on the public key servers), but probably
will be somewhere in the middle.

   2.  How feasable is it for an attacker to tamper with my secret
   ring?  UNIX security notwithstanding.  Presumably, an attacker
   could not deduce my passphrase cryptographically.  

As Colin said, if someone can modify your keyring, they have enough
access to modify PGP, which would be much easier to do.

   Thanks for your time.

Hope I helped.

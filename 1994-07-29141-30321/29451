Hi,

I decided to teach myself the DES Algorithm by writing a
program.  I've got a program that encrypts and decrypts
but is apparently not DES.  My guess is that I am not
handling the subkey generation properly, but it may also
have something to do with the S matrices.  I have
NBS Publication 500-20 which describes the verification
process but I need intermediate values for sub-key
generation.  Is this information available via ftp or
other net resource?  

Thanks in advance.

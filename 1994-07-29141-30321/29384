I promised myself I wouldn't get into this, but I'm getting a bit annoyed.

The (excellent) book with all the algorithms, source code and theory in it
*isn't* export-controlled, but the diskette (which I don't have) containing
essentially the typed-in source code in the book, plus some other equally
innocuous stuff, *is* export-controlled.  Makes no sense to me, unless
someone in NSA thinks the "furriners" are incapable of typing in and debugging
code in the book.  Same thing with DES...the algorithm's public, yet mailing 
a typed-in source to someone outside the country is illegal!

I think David Sternlight put it best:

>The values that define our common-sense world are under assault.

They sure are!  Unfortunately, it's our government bureaucracy that's doing the
assaulting.

 I speak only for myself, 3Com doesn't pay me to speak for them, so I don't.

	I said, Skipjack has no 'weak keys.'  In this context, I used
weak keys to refer to those keys that result in a significantly weaker
encryption (a DES key of all 0's or all 1's is weak, as are 14
others.)  See Applied Cryptography, page 232 for details.

	This does not mean that there are not good choices and bad key
choices.  A good set of choices will look random, not be vulnerble to
linear cryptanalysis.  A bad set of choices would be subject to a
dictionary attack on the keys, use consecutive, or otherwise
predictable keys, etc.

	Examining the following keys, which would you choose to use:

A.   1. b9b2d57f   2. bc754def    3. f57c72dd
B.   1. jun29and   2. jun30and	  3. jul01and

	Both sets of keys, will work.  Neither is weak in the sense
that an all 0 DES key is weak.  But the first set is stronger than the
second.  There are probably other, less obvious principles for key
generation that the NSA would prefer us not to know about.

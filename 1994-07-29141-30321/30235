I don't think this is a book cipher.

Here's an example of a book cipher system:

	cipher_char = (page, line, position)

where the character at (page, line, position) in some book (the KEY)
is the coresponding character of the plaintext. Note that each
ciphertext "character" is a 3-tuple (which may or may not be expressed
as such).

Berzerk:

I'll post a cryptogram in this system from home this evening.

How do you expect cryptanalysis of a book cipher to be easy? I've
never tackled one, and the reason is I expect my local library doesn't
have enough books to give me a good chance. After all, Alice and Bob
could (and I imagine, would) pick a key that is either very obscure or
very long (or both obscure and long, which is sometimes known as an
obscure longity, not to be confused with a long obscurity).

So how are you gonna tackle it?

Cheers.

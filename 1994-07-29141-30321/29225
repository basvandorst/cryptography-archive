Its been a while since I read it, but I'm pretty sure its in the
following book:

  Kozaczuk, Wladyslaw.  Enigma:  How the German Machine Cipher Was 
Broken,
  and How It Was Read by the Allies in World War Two.  Edited and
  Translated by Christopher Kasparek. (University  Publications of
  America, Inc., 1984).

  ISBN  0-89093-547-5

This book is, in essence, a story of the work of Marian Rejewski and his
colleagues in breaking the German Enigma cipher machine.  The text of
the book is primarily a history and has little detail on the techniques
used.  However, the appendices to the book are the real gems.  Most are
by Rejewski, and they describe the techniques, including the
mathematics, used in breaking Enigma.  As you can see from my notes, I
found the book at my public library.

HTH.  Regards, Brent

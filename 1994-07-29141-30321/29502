Exactly our thoughts when we designed nCrypt to use 'drop-in replacements'.
Especially since we distribute it as freeware with an untested algorithm
called 'Stop & Go'. We are also distributing a drop-in implementation of
Schneier's Blowfish.

We believe almost every app should be designed with this in mind. It's easy
to design for drop-in algorithms, and if you decide in the end to use only
one algorithm, you haven't lost anything.

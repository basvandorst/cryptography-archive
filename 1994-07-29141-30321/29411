You might find something faster than MD4, but I don't think you can get
anywhere near a *tenfold* increase in speed because of the I/O time which
would be required with *any* algorithm.  For example, on my PC, running MD4
(coded in assembly lang) on a 10 MB file takes 44.8 seconds, while simply
copying the same file to NUL takes 12.1 seconds.  I don't see how any
algorithm could do better than that.

  Here's a comparison I made of relative times of some well-known message
digest algorithms (to make the comparison as fair as possible, in this case
I compiled C versions of the algorithms, and normalized the times by divid-
ing each by the time required to copy the file to NUL):

                  Algorithm     Hash Length  Relative Time
              MD4                   128           4.6
              MD5                   128           5.3
              HAVAL (4 rounds)      160           7.3
              HAVAL (5 rounds)      160           8.7
              RIPEMD                128           9.2
              SHS                   160          11.0
              SNEFRU (6 rounds)     128          16.0
              MD2                   128          28.8

No, Ken, what I learned to my chagrin is that anagramming *can* be
done without multiple anagramming.  I don't want to do it (anagramming
happens to be a weak point for me), but it can be done.  It requires
a lot of skill.  Try to get hold of the Ol' Cajun's (Courville) booklet.

Now, how short the message must be before single anagramming is possible,
I cannot say.  The exercises Courville gives are as long as a typical
puzzle cipher, but that does not answer the question.  It is certainly
possible that your sample cipher is too long for anybody to anagram.

In the short run, we don't care which anagram is the "correct" one because
we are retrieving the plaintext, not the key.  There are many false keys,
but they do yield the correct plaintext.  I think it is an important
point.

After the plaintext is recovered there are more or less mathematical tests
that show where the provisional "key" is incorrect.  Ol' Cajun describes
them.  They were also described in a brief article in _The Cryptogram_.
If I remember correctly, Ol' Cajun says you may never get the valid key.

I would add, perhaps the skilled anagrammist won't solve all messages.
Indeed he may only solve a percentage.  But that still makes the security
of the double transposition unreliable.

I wish there was a lot more treatment of the double transposition.  But for
reasons unknown it is not treated in the open literature.

On trademarking: I believe simple use of a name implies trademarking, which
ought but needn't be accompanied by (tm).  (Much as this or any prose or
code is copyrighted though I haven't bothered to include the
circle-c/date/name.)  Serious businesses will register their trademarks,
which then get to use the (r) symbol.  Names released to the public domain
(e.g., Ada, which used to be Ada (tm)) don't have either.

(All this pertains to US law, and on the streets of Moscow or Bejing 
anything goes.)

I don't know whether the phrase "Pretty Good <x>" can be trademarked
without registering it; but an instance of the class, as in P.G.Privacy
is implicitly trademarked.

But I'm not a lawyer and wouldn't want to be.

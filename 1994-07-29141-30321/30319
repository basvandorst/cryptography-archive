It's been several years since I looked at crypt, but as I recall, it
was a modification of DES - they intentionally altered  some of 
the permutation matrices so that hardware implementations of DES could
not be used to crack the password file.  Also, I believe it was a 
large number of rounds of the algorithm so that it would intentionally
be slow - an impediment to software cracking programs.

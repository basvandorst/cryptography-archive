Yes, several people have received this code. Actually all you have to do is ask,
NON-Anonymously from a US site. (We have to obey the export laws you know).
The concept is rather straight-forward and can be used for encryption and
compression (if you hack the code). Basically you have a subdirectiry that is
"secured" by storing all files and file names in an encrypted manner (using DES
for encryption -- no escrow, no "new" backdoors, no "new" encryption weaknesses).
The trick to all of this is a special driver that creates a virtual mount-point
and performs all encryption/decryption for accesses to that mount point. Similar
in concept to the DOS-based disk compression drivers. 

Now, as for MB and AT&T, you have to remember that AT&T is a BIG company, and the
name may be inadvertly used for AT&T (the phone company), AT&T Bell Labs, etc.

Now, althogh I personally don't know Matt Blaze, I know that a researcher at a
company such as AT&T is encouraged to explore potential flaws in corporate
products (or other products). If AT&T is only interested in $$$ then their reputation 
is also going to be important to them. It is best if their OWN people find and publish
flaws, and help fix them, then to release a product and then have flaws found.

Lastly, if you don't trust the system, the authoir, or his employer. Don't use it.

   Well, I like this idea.  It should be possible to identify most plaintext
   files.  I think it could be automated.  I think almost all of them have
   tell-tale incipits (beginnings).  Think of .exe files for example.

   Any file not identified is a candidate encrypted file.

   Can anybody think of a legitimate plaintext file that does not have a
   characteristic incipit, and that appears random too?


Yes.  There are many such.  Raw data from some scientific equipment could
very easily be that structureless.

Possibly a better example: when we were in the very final stages of
factoring RSA-129 in April this year, we had an approximately
525000-square binary matrix.  That matrix was quite sparse, and so
looked fairly random.  However, in order to perform Gaussian
elimination on it we (actually, Arjen Lenstra) first converted it to a
dense matrix with about 190 thousand rows and columns.  The 35-gigabit
result had very little structure yet every bit was significant.  The
file holding that matrix satisfies your conditions, I believe.

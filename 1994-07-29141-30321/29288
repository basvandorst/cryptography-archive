This Enigma message and no. 3 are long enough to solve with a
ciphertext-only attack... using an Enigma program from Jim Reeds based on
one by Bob Morris as a starter, I tried each rotor order and rotor
starting position; the correct rotor order and starting letters produced
the only plaintext with an I.C. over 0.05.  Using this order and starting
position I added plugs one at a time, hill-climbing with the best of all
possible two-letter plugs from the current position, and there were no
false steps.  Ring positions AAA worked for message #2.  The same approach
worked for #3, but I stopped after recovering enough of the text to drive
a bombe (which I haven't implemented); I didn't recover the right ring
settings, but did get the first few dozen characters of plaintext.

This particular attack as implemented doesn't work on messages as short as
those recommended by the Germans -- on the order of 200 letters or less.

As far was public knowledge goes - yes. It will also slow the cypher
down a lot.

You didn't define whether the tripple DES is the two-key or the
three-key variant. Assuming that you mean the most often used two-key
variant, you have: 56+56 bits for 3DES2, 128+1 bits for 2IDEA (because
of the meet-in-the-middle attacks); this gets you 241 bits.

Yes. If the attacker knows this (and you must assume that they will),
then the security is reduced to breaking the weaker of the cyphers
(3DES2, which should be doable in 2^(47+47) chosen plaintexts at
least). But this is all overkill. Just single IDEA should be enough.

Depends on what the trapdoor is.

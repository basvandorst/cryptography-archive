Of course it is, and an idea that LONG predates computers.
(See, for example, "commercial codes.")

So, for example, that personal advertisement saying "Suzie please
come home, all is forgiven" actually means, to the person it is
intended for, "Sell our 'Suzie' stock holdings NOW!" or the like.

Any plaintext message might *mean* anything else at all, in
principle, than what it appears to mean, by someone who knows
how to interpret it in some special way.

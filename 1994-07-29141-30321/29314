Raw white noise samples are all that comes to mind.  But this approach
to ciphertext detection is easily foiled by adding some redundancy to
the ciphertext, so that it no longer appears random.  

Would the ciphertext hunter check every file in a .tar.Z?  Decode
and check everything that's uuencoded, xxencoded, ASCII-armored, or
embedded in a Word document?

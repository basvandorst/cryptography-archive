   I had been lead to belive that Fermat Theorem could pass

This is true, Carmichael numbers will pass Fermat.

   I also had always been led to belive that there are other tests
   which don't have this weakness (Knuth mentions at least one).

This is true as well.

   Question is, if these "better" tests are available, why not use them?

People people are lame?  ;-) Seriously, I know a number of people who
have been trying to convince developers to use Miller-Rabin.  In fact,
I've even heard of a test that will not give you a probabalistically
prime number, but a *provably* prime number.  However I don't know
offhand which test this is, and I've not seen code to do this.

   I understand that the composite numbers which "fool" Fermats theorem
   are very rare, but if you have to do the work anyway, why not use
   a stronger tool?

See the first sentence in the previous paragraph. :-)

   Is there a benefit to using Fermat over Rabin-Miller?  Is it lots faster?
   Is there patent "problem".  Is it just not worth thinking about?

Actually, no.  Fermat requires many more iterations to give you an
equivalent measure of primality, if I recall correctly.  I agree that
PGP, in the future, should use a better primality testing function.

Add this to the list of things to fix for 3.0? 

   Thanks!

Hope this helps.

Did you, at any time, stop to consider whether or not Phil actually wanted
you waving his letter around in public?

The problem here, obviously, is that you are waving your hands in the air
and discussing legal rights and freedoms. Perhaps you could give some
thought to the impact of your actions and statements on Phil and the rest
of the Net.

Here's a guy who performs an incredible public service, and he does you an
incredible favour. Now he writes you and says he'd rather you don't carry
on with your mods. So what's so shocking? What difference does it make what
your lawyer says you have a right to do? Maybe you could say to yourself
"Gee, Phil's a little cranky, but I'll respect his wishes because I'm a
nice guy".

You know, if you stopped fiddling with PGP and wrote your own app from
scratch, you might actually be performing a huge service of your own.
There's a lot of room for new crypto applications without revisiting PGP.
Be creative.

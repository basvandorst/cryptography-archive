And if you thought it was bad now, just wait a couple weeks.  You see
Tommy's machine is being moved to a new home, and will be off the net for
about a week.  Never fear though, once it's back, all the queued mail will
catch up and appear in your favorite threads, but will be about a week behind
everyone else - making Tommy sound even more clueless than he does now.

Ah, I think I see the problem.

You've been assuming that there's some kind of, uh . . . *logic* to
the whole thing.

I'm not actually sure what RSA's position would be on a setup like the
one you describe.  We've been talking to them about large commercial
applications, and they're definitely after more than just a couple
sales of TIPEM and BSAFE.  My impression is that revenue projections
enter their twisted little pricing equation more heavily than user
count (imagine that).

Any RSA guys out there want to clarify this?

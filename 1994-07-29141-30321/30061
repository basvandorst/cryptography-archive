The answer is simple:  The point of Clipper is to make sure
the gov't can still catch the "bad guys" by using a system
supposedly so secure, the government _had_ to have the keys
in escrow in advance.  What the spoof shows is that the bad guys
can still use Clipper withough the key escrow working.  

If that is true, Clipper is pointless, because there is no
legal and legitimate reason for noncriminals to escrow their
keys; if the bad guys get around the whole escrow business,
it is well nigh useless.

And, quite frankly, it also leads to credibility problems for
the Skipjack algorithm.  RSA is very good and very experienced
at no holds barred military cryptography.  But, since crypto
is always a war of specifics maybe this shows that they don't
know how to design a "crippled" commercial algorithm that really
offers any security at all.  Since they won't reveal the algorithm,
what else is wrong?  No one knows and we increasingly don't want
to find out.

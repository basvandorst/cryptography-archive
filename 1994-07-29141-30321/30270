I'm not sure what you mean by this. By network transportable, do you mean
that only some character codes are used? If such a limitation is required
by the encryption, shouldn't it also be required from the compression?

Well I am interested in this, particularly if it is a strong cipher that can
easily be compressed (ignoring, for the moment the natural redundancy that
compes from transporting things in undesireable character sets).

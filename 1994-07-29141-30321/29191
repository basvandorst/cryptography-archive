Hi all,

I have been looking at various RNG's of late and was wondering if anyone has
doen anything with choatic pendulums...?

For those unfamiliar with them:

You build a basic pendulum (say 2ft. tall) and place a metal ball as the bob
on the end. Under it you place several magnets (must be >3) and then swing 
the pendulum. Per chaos theory it is not possible to predict its path because
of the mapping of the attractor into a 'sponge' of various end points. 

If hall effects were to be placed around the pendulum so that the magnetic
field strength could be measured you would get a random sequence of digits
that were not predictable and should have no period.

Any references?

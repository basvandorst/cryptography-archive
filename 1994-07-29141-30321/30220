Just to bring this to closure:

After responding to David Sternlight's message regarding EFF posts to
sci.crypt with a request for comments from you, the readers of sci.crypt,
the "vote" tally is 7:1 in favour of such postings.  However, I still take
seriously the single objection that was raised, and believe it fair to
all concerned to limit postings that are not about the science or
mathematics of cryptography (that is, "political" postings) to those
requiring or inspiring some sort of immediate action (rather than just
"interesting" or "newsy" items) - warnings, action alerts, petitions, calls
for submission of comments on federal standards, truly shocking news, etc. 
Material like the Gore letter will not be posted to this newsgroup in the
future (by me anyway.) Those of you interested in "political" announcements
regarding crypto issues, but not at all interested in "political" debate
and banter on the subject (i.e. people not interested in following
talk.politics.crypto) may wish to subscribe to comp.org.eff.news (and
perhaps comp.org.cpsr.announce), which is low-traffic and contains no
discussion or debate.  

I figure this should make everyone happy, and I don't think any of us are
intersted in debating or arguing about such a low-priority matter any
further, as it is of even less relevance to sci.crypt's focus that the
post which inspired Mr. Sternlight's objection in the first place.
This will be my last post on this non-sci topic.

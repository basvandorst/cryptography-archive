I need not bother; Mr. Zimmerman did far better than I can do in the
documentation for PGP.   While he has faith in RSA, IDEA and in his
implementation, he understands and says that the security of neither PGP
nor data encrypted under it begins to approach the security of these
mechanisms.  On the other hand, used with care PGP will provide security
that approaches the security of the parties to the data.

Yes, and here is the writeup from `Security Reviews' v 2 no 1 (March 1993):



`On the Design and Security of Block Ciphers'

Xuejia Lai

ETH Series in Information Processing, vol 1, 1992 (Hartung-Gorre Verlag,
Konstanz)

This is the IDEA book - the book which explains the International Data
Encryption Algorithm used in PGP and elsewhere. It may well become the standard
work on block ciphers, as it provides the first full worked example of how to
design and test such an algorithm.

After a brief introduction to cryptology, IDEA is described and its design
principles are explained in detail. It is an eight-round iterated block cipher,
with each round made up from three different operations on 16-bit values -
bitwise exclusive or, addition modulo $2^{16}$ and multiplication modulo
$2^{16}+1$. These operations are used because they are incompatible; no
distributive or generalised associative law holds between any pair of them,
and this is described in terms of the theory of algebraic groups. The effect is
to make algebraic attacks difficult, and to guarantee good diffusion.

Next, the algorithm's vulnerability to differential cryptanalysis is 
considered. There is a very clear exposition of how this attack works, and the
concept of a Markov cipher is introduced to formalise it. This applies the
theory of Markov chains to iterated ciphers, and shows that such ciphers should
have an asymmetric transition matrix. It is argued that IDEA should resist any
differential attack, and numerical results for miniature versions of it are
presented in support.

The book closes with a review of the ways in which such a block cipher can be
chained to produce a hash function, and the various attacks possible in each 
case. All in all, a first-class book which should be in the library of
everyone interested in cryptographic algorithms.

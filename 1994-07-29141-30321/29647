I send the two data streams via two different couriers; if the feds find
one I help them find the other one.  Then the feds raid my house and find
a gamma-source random-number generator (or a diode-noise generator or
some other such).  The feds could easily discover that there were two
channels: the "plaintext" channel and a channel containing aparently random
noise.  But there'd be a perfectly plausible excuse for the noise: I'd
generated it (so I'd claim) using my random generator for use with the one
time pad.  Such use would be consistent with OTP message delivery, and
there'd be no way to disprove it short of producing the IDEA key needed to
decrypt the message.

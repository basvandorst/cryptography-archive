Who said anything about illegal arms export. I'd be posting source code
to newsgroups and mailing lists and leaving it on ftp sites. The government
can no more regulate this by calling it arms trafficking than they were able
to regulate newspapers 200 years ago by calling it sedition. Arms are physical
objects that you can hold, like disks. Source code is just a bunch of
mathematical ideas. The government can't do didly to anybody exporting ideas.

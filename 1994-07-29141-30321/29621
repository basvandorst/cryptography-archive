Now, if that isn't the pot calling the kettle black.  After all 
the stonewalling you've done concerning *YOUR* "real" identity, 
I'd not have thought that you'd be one a "full disclosure" kick 
all of a sudden.  Care to PROVE you REAL identity before others 
take your advice and avoid replying to the possibly pseudonymous 
"David Sternlight"?  Some say you're a shill for one of the Three 
Letter Agencies (TM)...

Interesting how you changed the subject away from the contents of 
*YOUR* signature block...

If you don't respond to "anonymous" people, why haven't you added 
the anonymous remailers to your infamous "kill file"?

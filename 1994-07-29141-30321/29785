: The argument is so fatuous it's unbelievable.  You should be ashamed of

fatuousW adjIfoolish or inane, esp. in an unconscious, complacent manner; 
sillyIunreal; illusory. adv. n. QSynIdense, dull, dim-witted. See foolish.

Would you please explain *why* the question is 'fatuous'? If a person believed
that stealing were wrong in every case *except* from convenience stores,
most people would either expect a convincing argument on why that apparent
inconsistency was just. Otherwise a reasonable person might conclude that
that person were simply pretending to have a deep explanation and actually
was simply a thief -- and a rationalizing liar too.


: Try the alt.atheism "Constructing a Logical Argument" FAQ,
: particularly the sections on Circumstantial Ad Hominem attacks (aka
: "Poisoning the Well").

Do you claim your use of "fatuous", "unbelievable", "ashamed of yourself",
and "David Sternlight" in your attempted rebuttal is *not* poisoning the well?


: I expect this kind of thing from D*v*d St*rnl*ght, but not from you.

I don't understand how this sentence helps me to see the error in my argument.

Here is a really simple crypto-algorithm I'm thinking about using for
data validation.  I was wondering what kind of attacks exist other than
exhaustive key-search:

These algorithms use deterministic pseudo-random number generators
which have no seed-sequential patterns evidnet.  That is, the same
starting seed will produce the same sequence, but there is no predictable
non-overlapping "counting" such as is done in an LFSR.  Let this device be
referenced as "numgen".

For all such numgens, an enemy could get them to run in reverse,
simply by running the thing with an initial key and storing each
data value.  What would be particulary useful is if someone could
come up with a one-way device.

Algorithm 1:

int message_length;	/* The length of the message in bytes */
int bit_message_length;	/* The length of the message in bits */

SPEC: key (seed to numgen) and length of numgen are arbitrary.

for (byte_index = 0; byte_index < message_length; byte_index++)
{
  output_byte = input_message[byte_index] XOR numgen MOD 256
}

As an added security measure, one might do a bit permute, counting
through each bit from 0 to bit_message_length and permuting with
bit[numgen mod bit_message_length].  For now, I'm leaving this
second part out since it can't be done on the physical layer.

This could also be run multiple times with multiple keys and with random
bit-lengths for the XORing.

I hope my posting this is not a violation of ITAR or anything like that.
This is an incredibly trivial algorithm, and at worst, it'd be like
throwing a couple of bee bee's to the enemy.  Those things can hurt,
however, if they hit you in the face.

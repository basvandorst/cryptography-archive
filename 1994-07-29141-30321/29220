Perhaps this is exactly what we need..  I wouldn't mind a
moderated group - so many people are screaming that setting up a
moderated sci.crypt is stealing some right from them - nobody
said they had to read or post to it..    At the same time.. and
I *know* this has been suggested before.. how about an
unmoderated sci.crypt.research / .technical?

I don't think the fact that some portion of the readership would
like a moderated group with less noise is the terrible thing is
being painted as.. Most people would read both anyways.. I
would :)

Seeing as how the trying to get a moderated sci.crypt has failed
again and again..  Perhaps some one wants to set up a mailing
list or digest of sorts?

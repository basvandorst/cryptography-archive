This kind of superencryption would surely increase security, at a cost of 
(1) more time spent encrypting, (2) more code and/or hardware dedicated 
to encrypting, and (3) more keys to manage.  The resulting key length 
would be the sum of the lengths of different keys you used (i. e., if you 
use the same keys for 3DES & IDEA, they only count once).  The effective 
key length could (and probably would) be shorter than the obvious key 
length calculation, if you compensate for any attacks that might be 
better than brute force.

It depends on the nature of the hypothetical trap door, and also depends 
if the cipher forms a group or not.

Diamond is the latest tweak to what started as the MPJ Encryption 
Algorithm about 5 years ago, and has been analyzed and slightly 
strengthened since then.  Diamond Lite is a smaller version scaled down 
to security comparable to some of the other 64-bit block ciphers for 
speed and size reasons.

Diamond uses a larger block size (128 bits instead of 64) to make 
dictionary attacks totally intractable.  It is one integrated, iterated 
cipher, so that the effect of multiple encryption is already built in (in 
such a way as to frustrate meet-in-the-middle attacks).  If you were 
contemplating superencryption of the sort mentioned above, you might be 
better off superencrypting with 3 unrelated ciphers, such as

Diamond Lite -> 3DES -> IDEA

Since the 3 ciphers work differently, there is virtually no way one could 
weaken another.  Diamond Lite is listed above instead of full strength 
Diamond just to match the smaller block size of the other two ciphers, 
but Diamond could be used, too, with the other ciphers run twice for each 
16-byte block.

Diamond and Diamond Lite both take variable length keys, so you can use 
128 bits or more, depending on your level of paranoia.  It also works 
pretty well to just use a variable length pass phrase for a Diamond key, 
with no hash step needed.

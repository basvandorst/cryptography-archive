If you want to protect an entire drive, your best bet is Norton's DiskLock.
It physically protects the drive at shutdown, sleep, system bombs, restart,
etc. as well as with an optional timeout. A password is required. The
physical protection is at driver level so it cannot be gotten around--as
far as anyone is concerned your drive is gone when locked. There is no known
way to recover it without the password.

It is fast, since it works only with the drivers rather than the entire disk
contents. Since a protected drive is hardware-inaccessible, one can't get at
it to overwrite the drivers.

It also has a file encryption capability, which uses DES. Some think that a
bit long in the tooth, but there's a freeware product, Curve Encrypt, for
drag and drop file encryption on the Mac, which uses IDEA. It is available
from the usual Mac ftp sites.

The values that define our common-sense world are under assault. Some have
taken to extremes the spurious notion of freedom without responsibility, and
are trying to tear down moral guardrails. Those who live on the shoulders
are told by their pals that they are in the middle of the road. Nothing is
wrong any more (except, of course, conservative thoughts and expressions).

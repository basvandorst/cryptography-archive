1. You are not an attorney and the above is probably a violation of law in
and of itself--giving legal advice without being a lawyer.

2. You don't know that the person will get off and are doing a disservice to
anyone who believes what you are saying and acts on it.

3. Since you take no responsiblity for the outcome, you are suggesting that
another puts himself at risk while yourself having no risk except that of a
big mouth in public.

This is not some kid's game. You are counseling a felony here on the grounds
that the perpetrator might get off, and you don't even have the legal
credentials to be legally entitled to give such advice.

I know I am taking a very strong position here, but this is VERY serious
business. Just ask those called before the Grand Jury about the export of
PGP.

taken to extremes the spurious notion of freedom without responsibility, and
are trying to tear down moral guardrails. Those who live on the shoulders
are told by their pals that they are in the middle of the road. Nothing is
wrong any more (except, of course, conservative thoughts and expressions).

Why is there such a performance hit?  Since writes are delayed it
would seem to have negligable effect.  Is it just the encoding/
decoding time?  If so, perhaps the CFS file system could be adapted
for a simpler (and export-restriction free) encryption method.  Tying
this with the ext2fs used by most of linuxers would be nice too...

: Thus my question:  does anyone know of and/or have some good
: references (books, papers, anything) on non-RSA public-private
: key encryption algorithms?  I have heard of systems using the
: knapsack problem and discrete logarithms, but have been unable
: to find a good reference.  Any help you could give me in tracking
: some down would be greatly appreciated.

There is a scheme called LUC developed by a group in New Zealand. There 
is some question as to how much of the original development was done by 
them and how much was borrowed, but in any case it differs from RSA. It 
is based on the use of Lucas sequences. The January 1993 Dr Dobb's 
Journal has a description, as does my book, Network and Internetwork 
Security (Prentic-hall/Macmillan, ISBN 0-02-415483-0).

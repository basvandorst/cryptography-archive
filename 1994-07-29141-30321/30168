As I said. DES can be exported only by shipping the processor along with
the program. Note that the standard does NOT say that "the type of
processor on which the algorithm runs must be specified", but rather
"the processor on which the algorithm runs must be specified".

So validated versions are either:

	special chips
	chips containing integral ROM which contains firmware
	uprocessors+ROM shipped as a single unit
	uprocessors+programs shipped as a single unit

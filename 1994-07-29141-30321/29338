I _was_ making new RSA keys, that is what made me curious.  I figured
that it would run out of it's "store" of random bits and ask me to
keyboard enter again.

When I made my first RSA key (512 bits), it asked me for these
key strokes.  It would say, that it needed 400 and something bits,
and to type, then when I made a second RSA key (1024) it said it needed
600 and something bits and to type.  No RSA key I've made since (I've
done 2 more of 1024) has asked for more bits.

Does it use my random timed keystrokes to make a seed for a BBS generator
and just run with that?  Will it ever again ask again for keystrokes?

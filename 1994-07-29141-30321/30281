   No, the period is (N-3P-3Q)/8, or about three bits shorter than N.
But yes, the best attack is to try to factor N by the fastest means
possible.

    Correct, there is no reason not to avoid short cycles (especially
X0 = 0, 1 or N-1) but the hypothetical attacker won't even look at the
values you use.

     But there are a couple reasons to use special N's.  The first is
that if you don't, you won't be able to read messages recieved.  But
there may be a way to choose "almost special" N's that are guarenteed
to work.  As long as you know the factors of N and of P and Q, and P2
and Q2 you can read the messages, but it is easier to choose special
primes than factor large numbers.  (This objection does not apply if
you are using BB&S in a private key confusion algorithm.)

     The second is that generating special primes is not that hard.
The million times as rare above is right but misleading.  If you do
the job right, you only search possible triplets, and check them as a
set.  The primes may be rarer, but the effort to find them is not
onerous.  For example, all special primes beyond double digits end in
seven or nine base ten.

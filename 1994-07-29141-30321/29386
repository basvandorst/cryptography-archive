   $16 million is your fixed cost.  To break one message or
thousands, you must first build your machine.  After that, your
cost per message broken is likely to be much lower, probably
on the order of $10 per key or something.
 
   Michael Weiner came up with a design for a keysearch machine for
DES that would cost less than $2 million, I believe, and would take
about 8 hours on average to find a key.  If you're in the blackmail
business, or in the business of stealing industrial secrets, then
you would probably find a keysearch machine quite valuable.

   If you're going to bother to use encryption, I think it makes sense
to use something that's not susceptible to currently-known attacks.
Single-DES isn't secure against an adversary willing to build one key-
search machine, and spend 8 hours per key breaking open messages to see
what's inside.  This allows someone who's tapping communications to
try several hundred, if just one message pays off really big.
 
   Why not encrypt your secrets with ROT13, or maybe one of the
simple polyalphabetic ciphers?

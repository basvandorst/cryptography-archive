No, hopefully there will be a second edition, with the numerous
errors corrected... there is an errata file that the author
posts from time to time in alt.security and elsewhere... 

Just from perusing that file it seemed to me that the book would
be too confusing to read with a copy of the errata in the other hand.

His publisher refuses to go to the trouble of printing a second editon
with these fixes/changes, but has no qualms against ordering more 
printings of the current one.

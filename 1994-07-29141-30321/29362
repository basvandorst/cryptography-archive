H'm... I don't really know MacPGP, but I can make a guess.  As you have
noticed, it gathers noise from all keystrokes, including those before
the bulk accumulation.  Thus, while PGP needs at least as many random bits
as there are in the modulus, any random bits that are already in the pool
are subtracted before deciding how many to accumulate.

Since MacPGP runs for a long time, if you make keys after using it
a fair bit, the pool will be full of entropy from previous keystrokes
(MacPGP may also use menu clicks and everything else for random numbers)
and not need further accumulation.

Try launching PGP and immediately generating a key.  It should ask then.

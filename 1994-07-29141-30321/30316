The only practical ways that *I* know to break encrypted ZIP archives
are either brute-force (works with random passwords of length up to 6
characters) or dictionary attacks (works against users who do not know
how to select good passwords and is *very* fast). However, I am by no
means a crypto expert. As opposed to that, the folks at the NSA are.
They are also known not to allow the export of any strong
cryptographic software. They did allow the export of PKZIP. Therefore,
I conclude that PKZIP's encryption is relatively weak. Usually the NSA
allows the export of crypto algorithms with effective keylength of 40
bits, which makes me think that PKZIP's encryption is not stronger
than this. If you can find a logical flaw in the above reasoning, be
my guest.

BTW, unlike the encryption, I *can* break the authentication in PKZIP
1.10.

That's fine - if the only thing you are interested of is to encrypt
your diary so that your girlfriend cannot read it - then PKZIP is
certainly good enough, provided that you use a good password too.
However, I thought that we were discussing *secure* crypto systems
here. In particular, the part that caused my laughter was PKWARE's
statement that "they are not sure which one is more secure - PGP or
PKZIP". :-)

I, at your place, would be more careful with statements like the
above. First, I am pretty sure that you do not speak for the
readership of this newsgroup, and second, I suspect that most readers
will disagree with you on this point - they seem to care about strong
crypto.

[Realizes that the clueless jerk is just posting a flame bait. Takes a
deep breath, trying to remain polite.]

I do not think that my posting was meaningless. I posted some facts
and reasonings, which, as it is obvious from your reply, have not been
known or considered by everybody. Therefore, my posting was useful.
Now, where was the meaningful part of *your* posting?

Nope. Obviously, the US guvmint does not consider my country (and the
correct spelling is "Bulgaria", please) as one of those countries. I
don't recall off-hand the full list, but you could call PKWare and ask
them. The list is not long - in includes Lybia, Iraq, Cuba, and the
police forces of South Africa. Maybe one-two more countries.

[Another flame bait. Another deep breath, trying to remain polite.]

I know several cryptanalysts. I am not a cryptanalyst myself - my main
field of expertise are computer viruses. I have several times asked
the cryptanalysts I know to take a serious look at PKZIP's encryption
algorithm. Every time I have received a reply in the sense that it is
weak, not as weak as WordPerfect's, so it cannot be cracked in a
couple of hours, and that they don't have the time to invest more
efforts in breaking some stupid shareware encryption program.

I also know somebody else (who is a virus expert like me, not a
cryptanalyst), who claimed that he can break PKZIP's encryption using
6-8 bytes of known-plaintext and a few hours on a fast PC (like '486).
His name is Anthony Naggs, but he is currently off the net. He
promissed me to write a paper about his method, but I have yet to see
it.

[Definitely loses patience.]

Listen, clueless, ignorant idiot! HPACK was designed by Peter Gutmann,
not by the NSA. Peter is from New Zealand, BTW, and one of the authors
of PGP 2.x. HPACK comes with full source, so anybody who has doubts
about the security of the encryption algorithms involved can check
them him/herself, or replace them with other algorithms of their own
choice. The secret-key encryption algorithm used is MDC/MD5, so
breaking it is no easier than reversing MD5. The public-key encryption
and the authentication algorithm is RSA. This is not your average puny 
crypto method developped in the backyard.

Get a clue - you need it badly.

Vesselin

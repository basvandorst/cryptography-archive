"Appropriate"?  PGP says it's using the "RSA" algorithm, and it is.
It's not as if he's taking the name "RSA" and using it for some other
algorithm, after all.  Where's the appropriation?

I've never heard anyone claim that Phil Zimmermann violated any
trademarks in the PGP documentation.  (In fact, I have no idea whether
or not PKP holds a trademark on "RSA" in the first place; I'd guess
not, but that's only a guess.)

Is there any basis for the accusation of trademark violation?

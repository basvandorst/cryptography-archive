I have a serious need to encrypt decrpty text stored on the fly, as I work
with it, and have it be somewhat unobtrusive, becasue I am always working
with these files.  I want the text files stored on a hidden partition on
the harddrive - okay... no problem.  And the encryption program and keys
are stored on an HD disk that is removable and kept on my person.
 
My problem, is that I can't find anything that has a built in editor.  I
didn the editor to handle calling the encryption/decrption schemes, as it
writes/read the text file, without having to crank up a seperate program
to do this.  I understand this is every easy to do on Unix, using shell
scripts/perl/emacs, etc, but I prefer working in the GUI of a Mac.  Does
anyone have any sugesstions?

If not, does anyone have any info help they can offer me on doing this all
under Unix.  I have BSD version of UNix I can run on  my mac.

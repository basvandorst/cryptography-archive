I'd like to inform myself about cryptologie. Can anyone suggest a
book, that might serve as an introduction for an absolut beginner?
I'm especially interested in electronic data encryption and
algorithms like DES, RSA, IDEA etc., but apart from this practical
aspect also in methods to attack an encryption.

Is there perhaps a FAQ on this topic? Where can I get it from?

I'm no student yet, so please don't suggest anything to complex, as I
might not understand it :-/. German and English publications are OK,
because German is my native language, and I've learned English at
school (don't want to judge my skills in English, nevertheless).

           Ciao, Patrick Ohly

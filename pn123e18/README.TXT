PGPn123 is a clipboard based PGP shell for Windows that includes
both message and file encryption features. It has the ability to 
connect with any other Windows based program and sit on top of 
it without obscuring other windows.

PGPn123 can also run in manual mode, without being linked to 
another program. In this mode, it will stay on top of ALL 
windows, ready to exchange data between the clip board and PGP.

Key management is included as a stand-alone module.

A new right-click menu is user-configurable and can be used for 
executing programs or pasting files into your messages.

Enhanced PGPn123 is distributed as shareware with a personal-use 
fee of $15.

Special requirements: PGP must be installed and working 
properly before use.

Shareware.

Installation: Unzip to \pgpn123 and run PGP_N123.EXE from 
Windows. A Program Manager group will be created automatically 
the first time you run the program.

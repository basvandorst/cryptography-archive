1.2:	`big_string' and `big_set_string' now runs faster.


1.1:	`big_set_string' can now take non-capital letters as digits.
	The external variable `big_end_string' points to the first
	character in the string that was not accepted as a digit.

	`mkhdr' failed when trying to create `internal.h' on a
	DEC-2060 when compiling with KCC.  Now works ok.

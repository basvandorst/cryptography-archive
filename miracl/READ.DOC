IBM PC MIRACL APPLICATIONS

PC-SCRAMBLER V6.0  - 

The directory SCRAMBLE contains a secure PC-to-PC communications program 
using the latest cryptographic methods, as a useful demonstration of the 
application of the MIRACL library. More information can be found in the 
file SCRAMBLE.DOC. The files in the scramble directory are SHAREWARE, and
may be grouped together and uploaded to your favourite Bulletin board. 

To create your own .kst files, run the program KEYIDS. This may take a long 
time to run, as it has to first carefully generate a large (unfactorisable) 
composite number, and then an unforgeable ID for each user. Each .KST file 
will contain the user's ID, a 'secret root' of this ID, and the large 
composite number. Note that the IDs are actually transmitted in the clear, 
prior to the negotiation of an encryption key, so the IDs themselves should 
not contain sensitive information. 

Each user is then given a copy of SCRAMBLE.EXE and their own private .KST 
file, which they should rename to SCRAMBLE.KST for convenience.

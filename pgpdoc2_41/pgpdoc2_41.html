<H3>TZFIX: timezone adjustment</H3>
<P>Default setting:  <CODE>TZFIX = 0</CODE>
<P>PGP provides timestamps for keys and signature certificates in
Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), or Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), which
means the same thing for our purposes.  When PGP asks the system for
the time of day, the system is supposed to provide it in GMT.  
<P>But sometimes, because of improperly configured MSDOS systems, the
system time is returned in US Pacific Standard Time time plus 8 hours.
Sounds weird, doesn't it?  Perhaps because of some sort of US
west-coast jingoism, MSDOS presumes local time is US Pacific time, and
pre-corrects Pacific time to GMT.  This adversely affects
the behavior of the internal MSDOS GMT time function that PGP calls.
However, if your MSDOS environmental variable TZ is already properly
defined for your timezone, this corrects the misconception MSDOS has
that the whole world lives on the US west coast.
<P>The configuration parameter TZFIX specifies the number of hours to
add to the system time function to get GMT, for GMT timestamps on
keys and signatures.  If the MSDOS environmental variable TZ is
defined properly, you can leave TZFIX=0.  Unix systems usually
shouldn't need to worry about setting TZFIX at all.  But if you are
using some other obscure operating system that doesn't know about
GMT, you may have to use TZFIX to adjust the system time to GMT. 
<P>On MSDOS systems that do not have TZ defined in the environment, you
should make TZFIX=0 for California, -1 for Colorado, -2 for Chicago,
-3 for New York, -8 for London, -9 for Amsterdam.  In the summer,
TZFIX should be manually decremented from these values.  What a mess.
<P>It would be much cleaner to set your MSDOS environmental variable TZ
in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file, and not use the TZFIX correction.  Then
MSDOS gives you good GMT timestamps, and will handle daylight savings
time adjustments for you.  Here are some sample lines to insert into
AUTOEXEC.BAT, depending on your time zone:
<PRE>
     For Los Angeles:  SET TZ=PST8PDT
     For Denver:       SET TZ=MST7MDT
     For Arizona:      SET TZ=MST7
        (Arizona never uses daylight savings time)
     For Chicago:      SET TZ=CST6CDT
     For New York:     SET TZ=EST5EDT
     For London:       SET TZ=GMT0BST
     For Amsterdam:    SET TZ=MET-1DST
     For Moscow:       SET TZ=MSK-3MSD
     For Aukland:      SET TZ=NZT-13

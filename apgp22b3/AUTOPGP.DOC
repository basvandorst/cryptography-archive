BETA RELEASE NOTE
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

   This is a beta release and as such is not fully tested under different
   hardware and software conditions. Use AutoPGP at your own risk. If you find
   a bug, please report it to the author (see "Bug Reports and Technical
   Support" below). For legal issues, refer to the section "Copyright,
   Licensing and Warranty".



OVERVIEW
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

   Offline AutoPGP (AutoPGP or APGP for short) is a program that integrates PGP
   encryption into your offline mail reader. It enables you to write encrypted
   messages and read decrypted messages from within your favourite mail reader,
   using the highly secure and widely acclaimed Pretty Good Privacy software
   package originally written by Philip Zimmermann - the new standard in public
   key encryption. AutoPGP combines the ease and comfort of reading and writing
   e-mail in an offliner with the security of public key encryption. You don't
   need any previous experience with PGP or any other encryption software, as
   AutoPGP will handle all interfacing with PGP automatically. If you are
   already familiar with the concepts of offline mail reading, you will soon
   feel comfortable with AutoPGP, even if you have never used PGP before.

   Features of AutoPGP v2.2á3 include:

   ş Support for all the most popular mail readers. You may use AutoPGP with
     any mail reader that conforms to the QWK or SOUP specifications. Readers
     that use PCBoard and MBBS capture files (e.g. XBoard and Offliner) are
     also supported. In addition, you may use AutoPGP on ordinary ASCII-files.

   ş Easy installation. An intuitive, easy-to-use installation program will
     configure AutoPGP correctly for the first-time user. The installation
     program will automatically detect many popular offline readers, and
     configure AutoPGP for use with these readers. It will also find the
     correct paths to PkZip, Arj, Lha and PGP, set DOS environment variables
     and update your AUTOEXEC.BAT file if necessary.

   ş Support for the latest PGP versions. AutoPGP has been successfully tested
     with PGP 2.3a, 2.6ui, 2.6n, 2.6, 2.6.1, 2.6.i, 2.6.2, 2.6.2i, 2.7 and
     2.7.1, and will probably work well with all PGP 2.x versions except 2.5
     (the MIT beta release). AutoPGP lets you read messages created with any
     2.x version of PGP, even if you are using PGP 2.3a. AutoPGP can also
     create messages that can be read by PGP 2.3a, even if you are using PGP
     2.6, 2.6.1 or 2.6.2.

   ş Automatic, seamless operation. When correctly set up, AutoPGP will
     automatically decrypt, encrypt and sign messages, verify signatures and
     add new public keys to your public key ring, all with a minimum of
     interaction from the user.

   ş Advanced functions not found in any other PGP front-end utility. AutoPGP
     lets you:

     o  encrypt a message to multiple recipients
     o  encrypt and/or sign only part(s) of a message
     o  insert your own or other users' public keys anywhere in a message
     o  include PGP ASCII armoured files in a message
     o  decrypt incoming messages, also those marked "For your eyes only"
     o  verify signatures on incoming messages
     o  add new public keys found in incoming messages to your keyring
     o  extract PGP ASCII armoured files from incoming messages
     o  choose PGP keys to use from an alphabetic pick list
     o  automatically retrieve PGP keys from a public key server
     o  and much more!

Limited licence 

   Offline AutoPGP is distributed under the ShareWare principles. This program
   is not free. You are granted a limited licence to evaluate AutoPGP for a
   period not to exceed 30 days. After 30 days, you must either pay for and
   register your copy of AutoPGP, or immediately discontinue its use and remove
   it from your computer.

   You are also granted the right to share AutoPGP with other users (and in
   fact encouraged to do so). You may freely copy AutoPGP, give it to friends
   and upload it to BBSes, as long as the following conditions are met:

   1) All the files in the original distribution archive APGP22B3.ZIP are
      distributed together.
   2) The files are not modified in any way.
   3) No fee is charged for copying and distribution other than a minimal fee
      covering the cost of the copying medium.

   Also note that AutoPGP makes use of a number of external programs, such as
   PGP, PkZip and others, some of which may require separate licensing in order
   to use legally. It is in your own interest to make sure that you are not
   infringing any patents or copyrights by using these programs, even if they
   are required by AutoPGP for proper functioning. In particular, you should
   notice that the use of PGP may be restricted or even prohibited in some
   countries. The RSA algorithm employed by PGP is patented by a California
   company called Public Key Partners (U.S. patent #4,405,829), and you may be
   infringing this patent if you use PGP v2.3a or earlier in the USA.


Registering Offline AutoPGP

   You are encouraged to try the program for up to 30 days to determine if it
   meets your needs. If you want to continue using AutoPGP after this time, you
   will have to register it.

   IF YOU DO NOT REGISTER AutoPGP AT THE END OF THE EVALUATION PERIOD, YOU MUST
   DELETE ALL COPIES OF AutoPGP FROM YOUR SYSTEM AND NEVER USE IT AGAIN.

   To register AutoPGP, run the program REGISTER.EXE and follow the
   instructions. The registering fee is currently only US $15 (or NOK 100,
   whichever is most convenient). 20% of the registration fee goes to the
   Philip Zimmermann Legal Defense Fund, see http://www.netresponse.com/zldf/
   for details. Preferred modes of payment are credit cards (Visa, AmEx) and
   US cash. Please do not send cheques, money orders or other forms of payment
   that are not valid in Norway. Upon payment you will receive a unique
   registration number, sent to your e-mail address.

   As a registered user, you receive the following benefits:

   ş The right to use your copy of AutoPGP for an unlimited period of time.
   ş No more nagging ShareWare reminder notices.
   ş Free upgrades to all future versions of AutoPGP.
   ş Personal e-mail support. See "Bug Reports and Technical Support" below
     on how to contact the author.

   A large amount of work has gone into the development of AutoPGP, and the
   program is constantly improving. By registering AutoPGP, you help supporting
   further developments and enhancements of the program. Later versions will
   have new functions and support for more offline readers, but this depends
   on how many will register the program.

HOW DOES AutoPGP WORK?
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

   AutoPGP is actually three different programs, all working together in order
   to make PGP e-mail encryption as easy and painless as possible:

   ş DECRYPT.EXE is to be run after you have collected your incoming e-mail
     and quit your communications program, but before you enter your mail
     reader. DECRYPT will unpack the mail file(s), decrypt any PGP messages
     to you and collect new public keys which will be added to your public key
     ring. It will also extract ASCII armoured files included in the messages.

   ş ENCRYPT.EXE is to be run after you have written your replies and quit
     your mail reader, but before you start your communications program.
     ENCRYPT will scan through your outgoing messages, searching for any
     AutoPGP directives instructing ENCRYPT to encrypt and sign messages, as
     well as to insert public keys and ASCII armoured files into the messages.

   ş <READER>.BAT is a small batch file which calls DECRYPT, your mail reader,
     and ENCRYPT in the correct order. (<READER> is the name of the mail
     reader you are using with AutoPGP.) Feel free to modify this file
     yourself, to suit your own needs. If you are using an offline reader with
     a built-in communications program (such as 1st Reader), or if you want
     to decrypt or encrypt a single message at a time, you may want to call
     DECRYPT and ENCRYPT from inside the reader program, rather than using
     <READER>.BAT. For example, if your mail reader stores replies in the file
     REPLY.TXT, then executing 'ENCRYPT REPLY.TXT' from your mail reader will
     encrypt your reply.



INSTALLING PGP
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

   Before you install AutoPGP, you must have both PGP and a mail reader
   installed on your hard disk. If you have not yet installed PGP, now is the
   right time to do it. Although we recommend that you read the full
   documentation and installation guidelines for PGP, here's a short list to
   get you started:

   1.  Unpack the PGP distribution archive (e.g. PGP262I.ZIP) on your
       harddisk, preferably in a separate directory (e.g. C:\PGP).

   2.  Set the PGPPATH and TZ environment variables in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file,
       using a text editor, such as EDIT. PGPPATH is the path in which PGP's
       configuration file CONFIG.TXT is located (e.g. SET PGPPATH=C:\PGP),
       whereas TZ ("time zone") ensures that MS-DOS gives you correct GMT
       timestamps, and will handle daylight savings time adjustments for you.
       Here are some sample lines to insert into AUTOEXEC.BAT, depending on
       your time zone:

       For Los Angeles:  SET TZ=PST8PDT
       For Denver:       SET TZ=MST7MDT
       For Arizona:      SET TZ=MST7
          (Arizona never uses daylight savings time)
       For Chicago:      SET TZ=CST6CDT
       For New York:     SET TZ=EST5EDT
       For London:       SET TZ=GMT0BST
       For Oslo:         SET TZ=CET-1DST
       For Moscow:       SET TZ=MSK-3MSD
       For Sydney:       SET TZ=EST-10EDT
       For Aukland:      SET TZ=NZT-13

       NOTE: If you do not set the PGPPATH and TZ environment variables when
       installing PGP, the AutoPGP INSTALL program will set them for you, and
       update your AUTOEXEC.BAT file accordingly. (INSTALL will even attempt
       to deduce the correct TZ setting from your address.) AutoPGP will not
       run unless both PGPPATH and TZ are set.

   2a. If you have a RAM disk installed on your system, you should also
       consider setting the TMP environment variable. Normally, PGP will use
       the current directory for storing temporary files, but if the TMP
       variable is set, the directory specified here will be used instead.
       Setting TMP to point to a RAM disk will substantially reduce the time
       taken to encrypt and decrypt messages. For example, if your RAM disk
       is drive E:, you should add the following line to your AUTOEXEC.BAT:

       SET TMP=E:\

       If you don't have a RAM disk, set TMP to point to the fastest of your
       hard disks, and one which is not compressed with DoubleSpace, Stacker
       or another disk compression utility that may slow down the effective
       disk transfer rate.

   3.  Generate your own PGP key pair. This is done by entering "pgp -kg" on
       the command line, and following the instructions.

   4.  Start spreading your public key to other users. The easiest way to do
       this, is by using the [PGP MY KEY] directive with AutoPGP as described
       later in this manual. ENCRYPT will then automatically insert your
       public key into the message, and the recipient can later use your key
       to encrypt secret messages to you.

   5.  Read the PGP User's Guide! PGPDOC1.DOC should be compulsory reading for
       all users of PGP, whereas PGPDOC2.DOC is for more advanced users.



INSTALLING AutoPGP
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

   AutoPGP is extremely simple to install, provided that you have already
   installed a mail reader and that PGP is properly set up. All you have to do
   is to carry out these few steps:

   1. Unpack the file APGP22B3.ZIP using PkUnzip 2.x (which you have probably
      already done, since you are reading this file now).

   2. Run the batch file CHECKSIG.BAT to check the signature certificates of
      ENCRYPT.EXE, DECRYPT.EXE, INSTALL.EXE and REGISTER.EXE. If the signature
      check fails for any of the files, it could mean that they have been
      tampered with.

      IF THIS HAPPENS, DELETE ALL THE FILES FROM THE APGP22B3.ZIP ARCHIVE, AND
      TRY TO OBTAIN A NEW COPY FROM A DIFFERENT SOURCE. DO NOT INSTALL AutoPGP
      BEFORE YOU GET A VERSION WITH A GOOD SIGNATURE!

      In order to check the signatures, you will need the author's public key
      (keyid 0xCCEF447D). If you do not already have this key, CHECKSIG.BAT
      will extract it from the file KEYS.ASC and add it to your public
      keyring. It is, however, strongly recommended to obtain this key from
      a source other than the distribution archive itself. If you have access
      to a public key server, send the command "GET 0xCCEF447D" to get the
      correct key.

   3. Enter "INSTALL" on the command line and follow the instructions. You
      will then be asked which directory you would like to install AutoPGP in
      (e.g. C:\PGP\APGP). If you are upgrading from an earlier version of
      AutoPGP, simply specify your old APGP directory, and all the necessary
      files will be updated. INSTALL will then proceed and ask you which mail
      reader you want to use with AutoPGP, which secret key to use for signing
      messages (in case you have more than one) and so on. Filling in the
      different fields should be pretty self-explanatory (INSTALL will fill
      in most of them for you), and you can abort the installation at any time
      by pressing ESC.

   When finished, INSTALL will create a configuration file, AUTOPGP.CFG, in
   your AutoPGP directory which you can later edit manually using a text
   editor. INSTALL will also create a batch file called <READER>.BAT, where
   <READER> is the name of the mail reader currently set up for use with
   AutoPGP. AutoPGP is now installed on your system, and all you have to do is
   to enter '<READER>.BAT' on the command line to start your mail reader. If
   you are planning to use AutoPGP with more than one mail reader, then change
   to your AutoPGP directory and run 'INSTALL /A' for each additional mail
   reader. You will then get one batch file for each mail reader.



HOW TO USE IT
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

   When you start <READER>.BAT, DECRYPT will first search through your incoming
   mail, decrypt any PGP messages to you, and (if you want to) add new public
   keys to your public key ring. The only thing you have to do, is entering
   your pass phrase and answering 'Y' or 'N' from time to time. When DECRYPT
   is finished, <READER>.BAT will start your mail reader, and you can read and
   write messages as usual. Entering messages within the reader is done exactly
   as you are used to, but in addition to ordinary text, you may include a
   number of special AutoPGP directives. When you quit your mail reader and
   <READER>.BAT calls ENCRYPT, these directives will be recognized by ENCRYPT,
   instructing it to encrypt and sign messages, or to insert public keys into
   the text.


AutoPGP directives

   AutoPGP directives must be written on separate lines with no leading spaces
   (trailing spaces are allowed). Otherwise, ENCRYPT will treat them as
   ordinary text. Here is a list of valid directives in AutoPGP version 2.2á3:

   Directive                     Action

   [PGP ENCRYPT user1, user2..]  Instructs AutoPGP to encrypt the following
                                 text block using the specified key(s). A
                                 single message may be encrypted with up to
                                 10 public keys. If no users are specified,
                                 then AutoPGP will look at the name of the
                                 recipient(s) of the message and try to find
                                 the correct keys to use.

   [PGP SIGN ARMOUR user] or     Instruct AutoPGP to sign the following text
   [PGP SIGN ARMOR user]         block with one of your secret keys, using
                                 ASCII armour mode. If no user is specified,
                                 AutoPGP will use the default key (i.e. the
                                 key corresponding to MyKeyID in
                                 AUTOPGP.CFG).

   [PGP SIGN CLEAR user]         Instructs AutoPGP to sign the following text
                                 block with one of your secret keys, using
                                 cleartext mode. If no user is specified,
                                 AutoPGP will use the default key.

   [PGP SIGN user]               Defaults to either [PGP SIGN ARMOUR user] or
                                 [PGP SIGN CLEAR user] depending on the
                                 setting of the ClearSign variable in
                                 AUTOPGP.CFG.

   [PGP ENCRYPT users SIGN user] Instructs AutoPGP to both encrypt and sign
                                 the following text block. Both 'users' and
                                 'user' may be omitted.

   [PGP ON]                      Defaults to either [PGP ENCRYPT SIGN] or
                                 [PGP SIGN] depending on whether the message
                                 is private or public.

   [PGP ARMOUR] or               Instruct AutoPGP to protect the following
   [PGP ARMOR]                   text block with ASCII armour, ensuring that
                                 no data is lost when transferred through
                                 e-mail channels.

   [PGP OFF]                     Terminates the text block started with one
                                 of the above directives. If the whole
                                 message is to be signed/encrypted/armoured,
                                 this directive may be omitted, as it is
                                 automatically assumed at the end.

   [PGP KEY user]                Inserts a public key into the message. If no
                                 user is specified, AutoPGP will prompt you
                                 for the correct key to insert.

   [PGP MY KEY]                  Inserts your own public key into the
                                 message.

   [PGP VIEW KEY user]           Inserts the fingerprint and signatures (-kvv
                                 output) of the specified public key into the
                                 message. If no user is specified, AutoPGP
                                 will prompt you for the correct key.

   [PGP VIEW MY KEY]             Inserts the fingerprint and signatures of
                                 your own public key into the message.

   [PGP FILE filename]           Inserts a file into the message. The file
                                 may contain ASCII (text) or binary (program)
                                 information. It is neither encrypted nor
                                 signed (unless, of course, you place it
                                 inside a [PGP ENCRYPT]-block), but will be
                                 converted to PGP ASCII armour format,
                                 ensuring that no data is lost when
                                 transferred through e-mail channels.

   NOTE: The user you specify is the name of the person whose PGP key you want
   to use, consisting of as many characters as necessary to make it
   unambiguous. For instance, if you want to include John Q. Smith's public key
   in your message, you simply write '[PGP KEY john q]' on a separate line. If
   you want to specify a key id rather than a user name, you should use the
   '0x' prefix, e.g. '[PGP KEY 0xccef]'. If the specified user is ambiguous,
   then AutoPGP will let you choose which key to use from a pick list of public
   keys.


Sample messages

   Here are two examples of what a message might look like, as seen inside your
   mail reader's text editor. Notice that all AutoPGP directives are written
   on separate lines, and that they can be referred to inside the message text
   without confusing ENCRYPT:

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------

   Dave,

   [pgp on]

   Just checking if AutoPGP really works the way it should. It's quite simple
   to use, just add '[pgp on]' at the beginning of the part that is to be
   encrypted, and AutoPGP will do all the work for you. Since the rest of this
   message is encrypted, I don't even have to include the directive '[pgp off]'
   at the end.

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------

   Hi, Paul!

   Here is the public key you asked for:

   [PGP ENCRYPT SIGN]
   This text block is encrypted, in order to ensure that the public key has not
   been tampered with. Here it is:

   [PGP KEY Robert P]

   The key was handed to me personally, so I have certified it and can
   guarantee that it is genuine.

   I also include a small program I wrote which might interest you:

   [PGP FILE C:\PASCAL\MYPROG.EXE]

   Please don't give it away to others, as I am not yet finished with it.
   [PGP OFF]

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------



CONFIGURING AutoPGP
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

   ENCRYPT and DECRYPT use a special configuration file, AUTOPGP.CFG, which 
   enables you to customize AutoPGP in various ways. If you perform an ordinary
   installation of AutoPGP as described in "Installing AutoPGP" above, you will
   normally not have to worry about the settings in AUTOPGP.CFG, as they will
   be set automatically the first time you run INSTALL. But if you have any
   special preferences as to how AutoPGP should be set up, you may find this
   configuration file useful. Here you can specify the values of a number of
   AutoPGP system variables. All assignments take the form <variable> =
   <value>, and all variables are case insensitive. Lines that start with '#'
   are treated as comments.


   Variable         Value

   MyName,          Your name and address.
   MyAddress and
   MyTown

   MyCountry        Your country. If set to 'Norway' or 'Norge', AutoPGP will
                    handle Norwegian names specially, and REGISTER.EXE will
                    generate the registration form in Norwegian rather than
                    in English. 

   MyEmailAddress   Your Internet e-mail address. If you have more than one,
                    specify the preferred address for PGP encrypted mail.

   MyKeyID          The key id of the secret key which will normally be used
                    for signing PGP messages, and inserted with the [PGP MY
                    KEY] directive. If you only have one key in your secret
                    key ring, you will not have to worry about this variable.

   PGPPath          Full path to the PGP.EXE program. Note that the directory
                    in which PGP.EXE resides is not necessarily the same
                    directory where CONFIG.TXT, PUBRING.PGP and SECRING.PGP
                    will be found. The path to these files is controlled
                    through the PGPPATH environment variable. (The keyrings
                    may optionally by placed in another directory than
                    CONFIG.TXT, by specifying the pubring and secring options
                    in CONFIG.TXT itself.)

   PGPVersion       The version number of the PGP.EXE file that you are using
                    with AutoPGP. Possible settings are:

                    2.3a   - International version
                    2.6ui  - International 2.6 compatible version
                    2.6n   - Norwegian 2.6 compatible version
                    2.6    - MIT version (USA only)
                    2.6.1  - MIT bug-fix (USA only)
                    2.6.i  - International edition of 2.6.1
                    2.6.2  - MIT bug-fix (USA only)
                    2.6.2i - International edition of 2.6.2
                    2.7    - Commercial version from ViaCrypt (USA only)
                    2.7.1  - ViaCrypt bug-fix (USA only)
                    2.7b   - Bangkok hack of PGP 2.3a
                    2.x    - Generic 2.x version

                    The PGPVersion setting affects the way AutoPGP interfaces
                    with PGP.EXE. Specifically, this setting will tell
                    AutoPGP:

                    - How big keys should be allowed for encrypting messages
                    - How many digits of the key id should be passed to
                      PGP.EXE
                    - Whether the '-o' option must be used for specifying
                      output filenames
                    - How to create messages that are backwards compatible
                      with PGP 2.3a (the UseOldFormat option, see below)

                    The following table illustrates the differences between
                    the various PGP versions:

                    PGPVersion  Max key    Digits    Use '-o'  UseOldFormat
                    setting     size       in keyid  option?   option

                    2.3a        1280       6         No        (none)
                    2.6ui       1280       8         No        +vers=2
                    2.6n        4096       8         No        +vers=2
                    2.6         1024       8         Yes       +ce=0 +le
                    2.6.1       1280       8         Yes       +ce=0 +le
                    2.6.i       2048       8         Yes       +le=off
                    2.6.2       2048       8         Yes       (none)
                    2.6.2i      2048       8         Yes       +le=off
                    2.7         1280       8         Yes       +pkc=2
                    2.7.1       2048       8         Yes       +pkc=2
                    2.7b        1280       6         No        (none)
                    2.x         unlimited  6         Yes       (none)

                    In order for AutoPGP to work properly, it is very
                    important that PGPVersion is correctly set. Normally this
                    is done automatically by the INSTALL program. If you want
                    to use AutoPGP with a PGP version other than those listed
                    here, you should try the generic '2.x' setting, or one of
                    the versions that resembles your version most (e.g. if
                    your version is basically a hack of 2.3a, use the '2.3a'
                    setting).

   ArmourVersion    PGP version number, as shown in the ASCII armour output.
                    By setting this variable you can make all your outgoing
                    PGP messages look like they have been created with a
                    different version of PGP than the one you are actually
                    using. This is particularly useful if you are using PGP
                    2.3a and want to post your public key to a key server
                    that only accepts keys marked as 2.4 or later.
                    ArmourVersion does not have to specify a legal PGP
                    version, in fact it could be any text string ('2.6nsa',
                    '2.9', '6.0 beta', 'My version' etc.). If you leave
                    ArmourVersion blank, then ENCRYPT will not change the
                    version number on your outgoing messages.

   TmpDir           Path to the directory in which AutoPGP will place the
                    temporary files needed for encryption and decryption. If
                    set to 'TMP' or 'TEMP', AutoPGP will use the directory
                    specified in the TMP or TEMP environment variables
                    respectively.

   UseXMS           'Yes' or 'No', telling AutoPGP whether it should try to
                    use XMS (extended memory) if available. The default
                    setting is Yes.

   ZipCommand       Command to run for packing PkZip files.

   UnZipCommand     Command to run for unpacking PkZip files.

   ArjCommand       Command to run for packing Arj files.

   UnArjCommand     Command to run for unpacking Arj files.

   LhaCommand       Command to run for packing Lha(rc) files.

   UnLhaCommand     Command to run for unpacking Lha(rc) files.

   LogFile          Name of logfile to use with AutoPGP. The logfile provides
                    detailed information on what AutoPGP is doing 'behind the
                    scenes', and is an invaluable tool when trying to locate
                    problems and errors. Leave this blank if you don't want
                    a logfile.

   MaxLogSize       Maximum size of the logfile (in bytes). When the logfile
                    grows bigger than the size specified here, it is deleted
                    and a new, empty logfile is created. If MaxLogSize is
                    zero, the logfile will never be deleted, no matter how
                    big it gets.

   EchoPassPhrase   'Yes' or 'No', telling DECRYPT and ENCRYPT whether to
                    echo your keystrokes to the screen when you type your
                    pass phrase, making it easier to avoid misspelling. (Note
                    that when set to 'Yes', AutoPGP will not echo the actual
                    characters you type, instead your pass phrase will show
                    up as '********...', with one '*' for each character.)

   KeepPassPhrase   'Yes' or 'No', telling DECRYPT and ENCRYPT whether to
                    keep the pass phrase in the PGPPASS environment variable
                    between AutoPGP sessions. The default is 'No', which
                    means that you will have to re-enter the pass phrase each
                    time ENCRYPT and DECRYPT are started. NB! This option
                    should be used with extreme caution, as it enables anyone
                    who has access to your environment table to read your
                    pass phrase. Also note that KeepPassPhrase will not work
                    if you are running AutoPGP under Windows or OS/2, and
                    open a new DOS window for each AutoPGP session.

   DoAreas          Message areas to include/skip when scanning for PGP
   and              messages. These two variables allow you to specify which
   SkipAreas        areas, (i.e. conferences or newsgroups) should be
                    processed by DECRYPT. This is particularly useful if you
                    don't want to waste time checking PGP signatures in
                    alt.security.pgp and other large newsgroups. If you
                    specify more than one message area, they should be
                    separated by commas. Use DoAreas if you only want to scan
                    a small number of areas, and SkipAreas if you want to
                    scan all but a few areas. Only one of DoAreas and
                    SkipAreas may be in effect at a time, so if both are
                    specified the last one takes effect. If none are
                    specified, then all areas will be scanned for incoming
                    PGP messages.

   KeepHeaders      Internet headers to keep/remove in incoming messages.
   and              When you import messages from Internet mail or news,
   RemoveHeaders    you may find that the first 10-15 lines of the message
                    body contain information of little interest to humans.
                    KeepHeaders and RemoveHeaders allow you to get rid of
                    this verbose information by specifying which headers to
                    keep and which to remove. If you specify more than one
                    header, they should be separated by commas. Use
                    KeepHeaders if you only want to keep a small number of
                    the headers, and RemoveHeaders if you want to keep all
                    but a few headers. Only one of KeepHeaders and
                    RemoveHeaders may be in effect at a time, so if both are
                    specified the last one takes effect. If none are
                    specified, then all the headers will be kept in the
                    incoming messages.

   MarkPGPUsers     'Yes' or 'No', telling DECRYPT whether to mark all
                    incoming messages that are sent by PGP users. The default
                    setting is 'Yes'. This means that if, for example, you
                    receive an unencrypted message from a person called 'John
                    Doe' whose public key is in your keyring, then AutoPGP
                    will insert the text '(John Doe uses PGP)' at the
                    beginning of the message. This makes it easy to see that
                    replies to the message may be encrypted with PGP.

   AddNewKeys       'Yes', 'No' or 'Prompt', telling DECRYPT what to do when
                    it finds a new public key in a message:

                    Yes    = All new keys will be added to your keyring
                    No     = No new keys will be added to your keyring
                    Prompt = DECRYPT will ask the user what to do for
                             each new key (default)

   AutoRequestKeys  'Yes', 'No' or 'Prompt', telling AutoPGP whether it
                    should try to retrieve unknown public keys from an
                    Internet key server. For example, if AutoRequestKeys is
                    set to 'Yes' and DECRYPT cannot verify the signature of
                    a message because you do not have the required public
                    key, then AutoPGP will automatically generate a message
                    that will be sent to a public key server, requesting the
                    key. (Note: this option will not work if MyEmailAddress
                    is not specified, i.e. if you don't have Internet
                    access.)

   KeyServer        The e-mail address of the key server that AutoPGP will
                    use for the AutoRequestKeys option. The default key
                    server is pgp-public-keys@keys.pgp.net.

   EmailArea        BBS conference name for Internet e-mail (not needed for
                    SOUP readers). AutoPGP will use this conference for its
                    auto-generated messages, e.g. when retrieving unknown
                    public keys, submitting registration information, etc.

   SaveFilesToDisk  'Yes', 'No' or 'Prompt', telling DECRYPT whether files
                    included in messages with the [PGP FILE] directive (i.e.
                    ASCII armoured files) should be extracted and saved as
                    separate files in your download directory. Normally this
                    option only applies to binary files (but see
                    SaveASCIIFiles below). The default setting is 'Yes'.

   SaveASCIIFiles   'Yes' or 'No', telling DECRYPT whether ASCII-files
                    included in messages with the [PGP FILE] directive should
                    be extracted as separate files, or just converted to
                    plaintext inside the message (default). If set to 'Yes',
                    the value of SaveFilesToDisk determines if the files will
                    actually be saved on your disk.

   ShowRecipients   'Yes' or 'No', telling DECRYPT whether to list all
                    persons (apart from the sender and yourself) who will be
                    able to decrypt each message. The default setting is
                    'Yes', which means that you will always know whether the
                    message you are reading was encrypted to multiple
                    recipients and thus can be read by other persons.

   MakeNDXFiles     'Yes' or 'No', telling DECRYPT whether to recreate the
                    index (.NDX) files in the QWK packet after the messages
                    have been processed. If your mail reader doesn't need the
                    .NDX files (most new readers don't), then you should set
                    this variable to 'No'.

   RecompressMail   'Yes' or 'No', telling DECRYPT whether to recompress the
                    incoming mail files after they have been processed.
                    Setting this variable to 'Yes' will save some disk space,
                    but it will also slow down AutoPGP.

   UseOldFormat     'Yes' or 'No', telling ENCRYPT whether to create messages
                    that are backwards compatible with PGP 2.3a and earlier
                    versions. If you are using PGP 2.6 or later with AutoPGP
                    and want to send messages to someone who is using PGP
                    2.3a, then you should make sure that this variable is set
                    to 'Yes'.

                    NOTE: In order for this option to function properly, it
                    is very important that the PGPVersion variable is
                    correctly set. Also note that setting UseOldFormat to
                    'No' does not necessarily mean that AutoPGP will generate
                    messages that cannot be read by PGP 2.3a. This depends on
                    which PGP version you are using and on the settings in
                    PGP's CONFIG.TXT file.

   EncryptToSelf    'Yes' or 'No', telling ENCRYPT whether encrypted messages
                    should also be encrypted with your own public key. The
                    default setting is 'Yes', but if you are using an
                    anonymous remailer or for some other reason don't want to
                    reveal your identity to the recipients of your messages,
                    then you should set this variable to 'No'.

   AutoEncrypt      'Yes', 'No' or 'Prompt', telling ENCRYPT whether it
                    should attempt to encrypt messages that are private and
                    do not contain any [PGP ENCRYPT] or [PGP SIGN]
                    directives. The default setting is 'Prompt'.

   AutoSign         'Yes', 'No' or 'Prompt', telling ENCRYPT whether it
                    should attempt to sign all messages that are not already
                    signed or encrypted.

   AutoPrivate      'Yes' or 'No', telling ENCRYPT whether messages that are
                    only encrypted to one recipient (and possibly yourself)
                    automatically should be marked as 'Private'. The default
                    setting is 'Yes'. This option has no effect on SOUP
                    messages.

   Greeting         Text to insert at the top of each outgoing message. The
                    contents of Greeting is in fact a macro which is expanded
                    according to the name of the recipient of the message.
                    Some examples:

                    Hello, %fname!
                    Dear Mr %lname,
                    %name wrote:

                    If Greeting is not set, or if the message already
                    contains the name of the recipient on the first line
                    (e.g. if your mail reader has a built-in greeting
                    function), then ENCRYPT will not insert the greeting.

   ClearSign        'Yes' or 'No', telling ENCRYPT whether to send signed
                    (unencrypted) messages as cleartext or PGP armour files
                    respectively. This variable only affects the function of
                    the [PGP SIGN] directive, and can be overridden by using
                    the [PGP SIGN ARMOUR] or [PGP SIGN CLEAR] directives when
                    signing messages.

   QuoteSymbol      Symbol used for quoting text in reply messages. This
                    symbol replaces the quote symbol used by some mail
                    readers with limited quoting options. Normally, you
                    should leave this blank.

   TagLine          Your own, personal tagline/sigline which will be added at
                    the end of all messages for upload, replacing the tag
                    generated by your mail reader. The following macros are
                    recognized in the TagLine string:

                    %ver    AutoPGP version number (= 2.2á3)
                    %regno  Your registration number (e.g. #073)

                    If TagLine is not set, ENCRYPT will not replace the
                    original tag.

   EncryptTag       'Yes' or 'No', telling ENCRYPT whether the tagline should
                    be placed inside or outside encrypted/signed messages.
                    Normally the tagline is placed at the very end of the
                    message, but if you set EncryptTag to Yes, then ENCRYPT
                    will move the tagline inside the PGP ASCII armour in all
                    encrypted/signed messages where you omit the [PGP OFF]
                    directive.

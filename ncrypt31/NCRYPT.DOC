NCRYPT                     DOCUMENTATION 
                                   

NAME
   ncrypt  -    encrypt/decrypt a file
   

SYNOPSIS
   ncrypt [-e,-d]  file1  file2
   

DESCRIPTION
   Ncrypt is a file encryption program which takes a password as an encryption
   key.  Options to encrypt or decrypt a file are taken on the command line as
   are the source file (file1) and target file (file2).  You are prompted for
   a password after the command line has been entered.  The password will not
   show up on the screen you will see dots echo.  In order to insure that the
   password is correct you will be again prompted to enter your password. The
   encrypted file created is exactly the same size as it was in non-encrypted
   form.  
   

OPTIONS
   -e          Encrypt source file into target file.
   
   -d          Decrypt encrypted source file into target file.
   

EXAMPLES:
   To encrypt the file secret.zip as the file secret.cry using h1234 as
   a password.  (Dots are always echoed when entering the password)

C>ncrypt -e secret.zip secret.cry 
Enter the password 30 characters or less 
press <BACKSPACE> to correct
.....
Enter your password again to verify
.....    


   To decrypt the file secret.cry into secret.zip

C>ncrypt -d secret.cry secret.zip
Enter the password 30 characters or less 
press <BACKSPACE> to correct 
.....
Enter your password again to verify
.....    
     

WHY USE NCRYPT:
   There can be many reasons for encrypting your data:  A sysop of a 
   bbs could use ncrypt to keep his list of users and their passwords
   encrypted.  This way if a member of said bbs were to obtain that 
   list of names and passwords using a trojan horse program to make it
   available for download it would be useless to him.  If you own a
   business and have some sensitive data you don't want anyone reading
   or if you have a network account with personal messages you don't
   want the administrator to read this is the program for you.  Since
   ncrypt dosen't increase the file size it's ideal to transmit business
   data over the phone line.


SPECIAL NOTES:
   Should you give the wrong password to decrypt a file this will NOT be
   detected.  The target file will be meaningless garbage.  The decrypted
   file  should  therefore  be checked  BEFORE the  encrypted  version is 
   deleted.
   
   Should you by mistake decrypt a file (-d) instead of encrypting it (-e)
   and have deleted your original, the target file can be returned to 
   normal using the (-e) option.
   
   People using file compression programs such as LHARC,ZOO,ARJ,ZIP
   should compress their files before encrypting them since ncrypt 
   removes much of the redundancy of files.  
   
   In order to help insure that ncrypt.exe is VIRUS FREE a program 
   called nval.exe has been created to test the integrity of ncrypt.
   Do NOT compress ncrypt using programs like LZEXE,DIET,EXEPACK, or
   PKLITE if you wish to test ncrypt.exe with nval.  Please read 
   nval.doc for more information on nval.  If nval.exe file it is 
   recommended that you at LEAST verify to see that ncrypt.exe
   (version 3.10) has 14222 bytes.
   
   

LEGAL STUFF AND REGISTRATION

The algorithm used was developped independently of any literature on
the subject of data encryption.  The author hasn't read any texts on this
subject and any ressemblance that may or may not exist between this algorithm
and any previous algorithms is purely coincidental.

NCRYPT HISTORY          
    NCRYPT in all of it's versions has been tested on both AT computers
    (compatible with IBM PC'S), and Apollo Workstations using UNIX
    bsd4.3.  Some versions of NCRYPT (2.11,2.12) have also been tested
    on a mips machine using UNIX SYS V.  The vanilla C source compiled 
    without any problems on each UNIX platforms as well as on IBM PC 
    compatibles using a Zortech C compiler.


VERSION 1.00 TO 2.00 :  First buggy and badly performing versions.
                        The encryption algorithm used in these 
                        versions allowed a partial decryption if
                        something approaching the password was given.
                        

VERSION 2.08 :          A new algorithm is developped and a partially
                        correct password can no longer partially decrypt
                        the file.  
                        

VERSION 2.11 :          Bigger file buffers are used to make ncrypt faster.
                        The previous versions took too long to encrypt files
                        over 1Meg.
                        

VERSION 2.12 :          Essentially the same as 2.11.  Ncrypt now asks for
                        the password before opening the input file.  This
                        made it easier for the output file to be a pop-up
                        window on a UNIX work station.
                        

VERSION 2.13 :          The procedure which gets the passwords from the user
                        no longer echo the letters to the screen.  Dots (.) 
                        are now echoed on the screen.  This option was made
                        in order to make it harder for people who look over
                        your shoulder and people reading your tty inputs on
                        a Unix network. 
                        

VERSION 3.01 :          PRE-SHAREWARE release version of ncrypt.  Preceding
                        version had been for the author's (and his friends) 
                        own use.  This documentation file has been created 
                        with this version.  Accompanying nval.exe and nval.doc 
                        have also been created to help detect viral infection 
                        of the executable ncrypt.exe.  A shareware message 
                        prompting you to register appears once in a while 
                        (20 % of the time you use it).

VERSION 3.10 :          This is the first SHAREWARE release version of ncrypt.
                        Small bug corrected in the procedure getting the 
                        passwords.  The 30 character limit had never been
                        tested.

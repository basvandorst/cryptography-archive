NVAL                           DOCUMENTATION


NAME
  nval  -       Verify a file
  

SYNOPSIS
  nval file
  

DESCRIPTION
  NVAL is a verification program distributed with ncrypt.exe.  The purpose
  of this file is to detect if ncrypt.exe has been modified in any way 
  before using it for the first time.  The method of verifying the integrity
  of the file is similar to a CRC check although they are differences.
  Since NVAL prints the test value it can also be used to test the integrity 
  of any file before & after a modem transmission.
  

OPTIONS 

  FILE          The filename to verify is the only parameter needed.
  

EXAMPLES:

nval ncrypt.exe  

Should print a value of FBFFD8 for ncrypt version 3.10.

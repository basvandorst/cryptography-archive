Announcing Nautilus 1.5:  Secure Telephony for your Computer
============================================================

WHAT IS NAUTILUS?
- -----------------

Nautilus is software which allows two users to hold a secure convers-
ation with one another either over ordinary phone lines or over a
computer network.  Nautilus runs on IBM PC-compatible computers
(386DX25 or faster) under MSDOS or Linux as well as audio-capable Sun
workstations running SunOS or Solaris.  The MSDOS version of Nautilus
requires a Soundblaster compatible sound card and currently only runs
over ordinary phone lines with a modem.

In order to use Nautilus over ordinary telephone lines, a modem capable
of connecting at 4800 bps or faster is required.  Audio quality ranges
from fair to very good depending on which of the four speech coders has
been selected.  Although the 4800 bps coder requires a 486DX50 or
faster, we expect that it will enable cellular phone users to secure
their sensitive telephone conversations with Nautilus and a laptop
computer.

Nautilus is distributed freely (subject to US export restrictions) with
full source code.  This insures that its security can be independently
examined and verified.  We believe that this is a necessary condition
to be met before any security software can be trusted with important
data.


WHAT IS NEW IN THIS RELEASE?
- ----------------------------

There are three major new features in this release.  Network support
(only available with Unix versions), Diffie-Hellman key exchange, and a
new LPC speech coder capable of operating at less than 4800 bps.  We
have also developed a new and more robust communications protocol that
should perform significantly better with less than perfect connections.
Since major portions of Nautilus have been redesigned and rewritten in
order to accomodate some of these changes, we regret to announce that
this version of Nautilus is not compatible with earlier versions.

New Feature Summary for Version 1.5:

    + Low bit-rate LPC coder (less than 4800 bps, very good audio quality)
    + Diffie-Hellman key exchange (with crypto hash/biometric authentication)
    + Network support (uses sockets) for Unix versions
    + Improved communications protocols for more reliable operation
    + Updated documentation

The remainder of this announcement is similar to earlier Nautilus
announcements, so if you have already seen earlier ones, just connect
to the nearest ftp site mentioned below to download the 1.5 release
of Nautilus.


HOW DOES NAUTILUS WORK?
- -----------------------

Nautilus uses your computer's audio hardware to digitize and play back
your speech using advanced speech compression algorithms built into the
program.  It encrypts the compressed speech using your choice of the
Blowfish, Triple DES, or IDEA block ciphers, and transmits the
encrypted packets over the internet or your modem to your friend's
computer.  At the other end, the process is reversed.  Nautilus
operates in half duplex mode like a speakerphone -- only one person
can talk at a time.  Either user can hit a key to switch between
talking and listening.

Earlier versions of Nautilus generated an encryption key from a shared
secret passphrase that you and your friend would choose together ahead
of time.  Beginning with version 1.5, Nautilus generates the encryption
key using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm by default, although
users may still revert to the secret passphrase method if they prefer.

Further details are in the documentation file included with the program.


WWW SITE
- --------

For up-to-date information about the current status of Nautilus,
pointers to ftp sites with Nautilus, pointers to URLs with information
related to Nautilus, and more, see the Nautilus WWW page:

        http://www.lila.com/nautilus


FTP SITES
- ---------

Nautilus is available in three different formats.  As a DOS executable,
it is available as an archive in zip format along with it's associated
documentation.  In source format, it is available as either a zip-ed
archive, or a gzip-compressed tar archive.  Note that if you wish to
compile your own version of Nautilus you will need to get the RSAREF
2.0 library, which is available free for non-commercial use in the US
and Canada from RSA Laboratories (anonymous ftp to rsa.com for
details).

Nautilus is available at the following FTP sites:

ftp://ftp.csn.org:/mpj/I_will_not_export/crypto_???????/voice/
This is an export controlled ftp site: read /mpj/README for
information on access.

ftp://ripem.msu.edu/pub/crypt/other/nautilus-phone-1.5a-source.tar.gz
ftp://ripem.msu.edu/pub/crypt/msdos/nautilus-phone-1.5a-source.zip
ftp://ripem.msu.edu/pub/crypt/msdos/nautilus-phone-1.5a-exe.zip
This is an export controlled ftp site: read /pub/crypt/GETTING_ACCESS
for information on access.

You may be able to find additional ftp sites using the "archie"
ftp site locating program.  See http://www.earn.net/gnrt/archie.html
for more info.


INTERNATIONAL USE
- -----------------

Sorry, but under current US law, Nautilus is legal for domestic use in
the US only.  We don't like this law but have to abide by it while it
is in effect.  Nautilus is distributed through export-restricted FTP
sites for this reason.  Export it at your own risk.


IMPORTANT
- ---------

We have done our best to choose secure ciphers and protocols for
Nautilus.  Earlier versions of the program have been reviewed by
several experts.  However, it is still VERY EASY to make mistakes
which could compromise the security.  We urge that users with very
high security needs take an in-depth approach to protecting their
privacy.  See the Nautilus documentation file for more information.

As usual, we encourage cryptographers and users alike to examine and
test the program thoroughly, and *please* let us know if you find
anything wrong.  As always, although we'll try to fix any bugs reported
to us, WE CANNOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY ERRORS.


CONTACTING THE DEVELOPERS
- -------------------------

The Nautilus development team is now made up of Bill Dorsey, Paul
Rubin, Andy Fingerhut, Paul Kronenwetter, Bill Soley, and Pat
Mullarky.  To contact the developers, send email to
<nautilus@lila.com>.

This announcement, and the source and executable distribution files,
are all signed with the following PGP public key.  Please use it to
check the authenticity of the files and of any fixes we may post.  Note
that this PGP public key differs from the one posted last year with the
1.0 release of Nautilus.

Basic Installation
==================

The simplest way to build and install Mailcrypt is:

  1. `cd' to the Mailcrypt source directory and type `./configure' to
     configure Mailcrypt for your system.

  2. Type `make' to build the byte-compiled Lisp files.

  3. Type `make install' to install the Mailcrypt Lisp files and Info
     manual.

Installation Names
==================

By default, `make install' will install the package's files in
`/usr/local/info' and `/usr/local/lib/emacs/site-lisp'.  You can
specify an installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving
`configure' the option `--prefix=PATH'.

Mailcrypt requires version 19 of GNU Emacs.  If your installed copy of
Emacs 19 is named something other than "emacs" or "xemacs", you will
need to tell `make' where to find it so that it can correctly
byte-compile the Mailcrypt sources.

For example, to use XEmacs, you might type:

	./configure
	make EMACS=xemacs
	make install

Also, the `--prefix=PATH' option to `configure' may not be general
enough to set the paths you want.  If not, you can pass variables to
the `make' command to control the installation.

For example, to put the Lisp files in `$HOME/elisp' and the Info file
in `$HOME/info', you would type:

	./configure
	make
	make lispdir=$HOME/elisp infodir=$HOME/info install

If you use VM, RMAIL, MH-E, or GNUS and the respective package is not
in your default load-path, Mailcrypt may fail to byte-compile
properly.  (Emacs does not load your `.emacs' file when run in batch
mode.)  If this applies to you, edit the Mailcrypt `load-path.hack'
file to add the appropriate directory to the load-path during byte
compilation.

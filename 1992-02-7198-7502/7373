Or my scheme, Snuffle, which does the same thing. It's based on roughly
the same principle as Phil's (unnamed) cipher, with maybe a bit less
chunkiness to the information flow. My snuffle package, version 5.0, is
an implementation of Snuffle using Snefru 2.5 with 8 passes as the hash
function. (Snefru for Merkle's hash function, Snuffle uppercase for my
mathematical turn-hashing-into-encryption algorithm, snuffle lowercase
for my Snuffle + Snefru implementation. As you'd expect, it's the
S-boxes in Snefru which provide cryptographic strength here.)

And Xerox lets you use Snefru, modify the code, etc., as long as you
don't eliminate their copyright notice. Why do you hear about MD-4 and
MD-5 a lot more than Snefru? Because RSA Inc. has done a much better job
than Xerox of insinuating itself into the Internet standards process. So
much for having these things decided by the users.

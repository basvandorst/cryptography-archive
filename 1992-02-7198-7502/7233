Hello again,
	Regarding my criticism of Dolphin Software:  I overreacted, plain
and simple.  I have nothing in particular against Dolphin, I am just getting
tired of reading long posts that could be cut quite a bit shorter, and, I
was just sort of ticked-off in general when I wrote my initial reply.
	I was, however, still offended by the low-key advertising.  Thank
you for abandoning it.  

	Regarding my summary of mail pertaining to the advertising issue:
(Believe it or not... this is true, but I'll never be able to prove it...)
The responders were split about 50/50, and those who responding either
\wanted to have my head or Dolphins or both.  (Except for the guy who
recommended that I go out drinking before my next post- a point well
taking, and hapilly at that.)

	So, anyway, I wasn't alone in being offended, but neither did I have
unanimous support *ahem* .

	Regarding the copyright issue:  Depending on what you meant, you
may or may not have claim to all the rights you thought you did.  I was
a tad overbearing in just broadly labeling your claim as idiotic.

	Anyway, to sum up, sorry to be such a jerk, next time I'll cool
off before posting, thanks everyone for the e-mail advice or support, 
thanks for the VI next screen characters, and sorry, Dolphin.

	Also, to guy the who insulted Caltech: Get a clue, the Flem was
right, no one spells it Cal Tech, not even the Ma department grad turkeys.

Later,
Heath

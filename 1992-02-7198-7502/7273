There is a service available via CompuServe called "Vital Stats" (Go VS)...
For around $10.00, you can look up someone's drivers license and/or vehicle
registration information for just about every state.  Some states pose
restrictions where you can only have the information mailed to you and 
such - but, for New York State, you can merely enter in someone's plate
number (or their vehicle's VIN) and get complete information on that
person.

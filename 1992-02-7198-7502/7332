Good!  Must have missed this in the documentation.  Unix behaves nicely.

YES!  When I delete a file from a shared PC in a common office environment
either explicitly or for example during file editing it would be nice if
it was impossible to retrieve the contents of that file rather than either
being able to just "undelete" it or recover the data by allocating the
same blocks to another file.

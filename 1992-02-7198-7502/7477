Something to keep in mind with this technique is that editors often
create multiple "temporary" files in different directories and drives.
For example, MS-DOS Wordperfect creates .BAK backup files, but by
default creates temporary checkpoint (crash-recovery) files in the same
directory as the executable, which is not likely to be the RAM disk.
Emacs at my site is configured to place auto-save files (when this
feature is enabled) on local disk storage space, rather than in the
user's account, which is an analogous privacy hole.

At this level, you might also start worrying about swap space.  If you
are running Wordperfect along with a task switcher that swaps to disk,
that memory image swapped out includes data from your files.  The text I
am typing right now could conceivably get swapped out onto disk where an
unscrupulous person with root privileges might be able to recover it
(although with 16Mb and only one user with few processes, I doubt it :)

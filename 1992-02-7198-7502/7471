Breaking DES by exhaustive keysearch is examined in two recent articles:

(1) `DES Watch', Gilles garon and Richard outerbridge, `Cryptologia' vol XV
     no 3 (July 1991) p 177 - 193

(2)  `How to Break DES', R Anderson, March 1990

Both confirm a prediction made in 1977 by Difffie and Hellman, that an
attack on DES would be feasible by 1990 using a special parallel machine
costing a few million dollars to solve for one key per day.

There is of course a time-cost tradeoff in that you could build a smaller
machine and wait longer. A solution time of a year could be achieved by
a machine costing in the 100,000 dollar region. Garron and Outerbridge
estimate that this will fall to about 10,000 dollars by 2000.

Large numbers of DES chips were supplied to the USSR by Robotron, a PC
manufacturer in East Germany. I wonder if anyone in the su.msk namespace
has a slightly used parallel machine they could lend you? ? ?

The request was for driver's license numbers, but....

Most of these files are public records and can be obtained somehow. It 
was possible to get car registrations in Texas by Telex, you had to set 
up and account, and there was a fee for each inquiry. Single inquiries 
could be obtained by phone free. This has changed due to varying states 
of paranoia so I'm not sure of the current status. There are ways to 
get large sets of such names/numbers for such studies as the requestor 
claims to be doing by using leaks in various computer systems. For 
example, the 17 character VIN ( veh. id. no. ) used on all auto sold in 
the U.S. has a check character built in. I looked at that and was 
surprized to discover how many cars are registered with incorrect VINs.

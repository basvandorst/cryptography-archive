Responding to Paul Kocher's inquiry about the ethics of publishing a tool
that can help crack the encryption protection of PKZIP:

I think that publishing methods of breaking a scheme weak enough to
break is a good idea.  If you do this, it may lead to stronger schemes 
that will benefit everyone.  Weaknesses should be exposed so that 
improvements can be made.  If someone has cancer, they should be informed
rather than be kept blissfully ignorant.  Eventually people will start 
using stronger methods that can withstand attacks.

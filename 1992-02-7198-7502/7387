I have a question for a real guru type.  How could I accomplish
the following:


	1. 	Mass distribute a program or data file in encrypted form
		such that some one who wanted to activate it, could
		call me, supply say a credit card number, and be enabled
		to use the file.  The distribution media for this file or 
		program would have the same encrypted data on all copies.
		
		The real question, is how to handle this without causing
		multiple people to be able to access the data.  For 
		example, each user that buys access to it, would be given
		an authorization code that would unlock the data, but if
		he took that code to another copy of the distribution 
		media, it would not unlock the item?
		
	2.	Would some variation of a Public key system do this, and
		if so, just how?
		

My earlier request about pawn-shop cyphers, was met with a couple of 
replies that have been most useful.  I think that I have worked out
a methodolgy to crack them that works fairly well.  It is based on a matrix
method by Rick Miller,  and a constraint approach by Bear Giles.
My initial trials were based on a diffrent type of matrix approach, but
Rick gave me the spark that made me change the way I was doing things.

As a side issue, I dropped by one of the pawn shops whos' code I have not
completelty cracked, but have cracked enough (WEIGHTL), (Rick suggested
that the othere letters might be part of the work LIFTING where in 
duplicate letters are discarded.  Rather diffrent, and I have not explored
it in any detail).  Anyway, there was a nice little stereo that was 
sitting there with a price tag of 89.00 and a code tag of GN.  Since N
is one of those that I did not know, I decied to offer the guy $50.00
for it assuming that n is probably 9.  The looked real funny, thought
a bit, and said yes.  I've been chuckling quiet contemplative little
chuckles ever since, and the stereo works quite well thank you.

Sort the codes by first letter.  Then create a matrix with the xcoord
being number and the ycoords being the various first letters.  Note:
stick to prices from 20-99 and from 1-10 first.  Then for each letter
put a checkmark under the column that represents the SMALLEST unique number
for that first position letter, and then put one under the column that
represents the LARGEST unique letter.  You can then fill inbetween them.
When done, then sort the letter rows so that the x's form a diagonal line
from upperleft to lower right, and most of the letters should be in order.
Then apply some logical reasoning.  Seems to work fairly well.

I has no price <10 or >20, so it is hard to isolate

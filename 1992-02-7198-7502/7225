Hello,

I am currently trying to write a program (in C) that uses the RSA encryption
technique to encrypt and decrypt large ascii files.  This is a fairly tedious
process given that the numbers are in the hundred to two hundred digit range.
However, most of my code runs fairly quickly except for the modulus part i.e.
when trying to find a mod b where a and b are 100+ digit numbers.  Does 
anyone know where I can find an algorithm to do this quickly?

Any pointers to literature/source code would be very helpful.

Please reply directly to barjun@leland.stanford.edu

Thanks very much,

Ashwin A. Bulchandani.

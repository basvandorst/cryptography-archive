     How fast do you need it?  On a 68030-type machine, MD4 crunches at
over 350,000 bytes/second (counting user+sys time only).  My 68040
machine crunches at over 750,000 bytes/second.  Modern RISC machines
will scream at an even faster amount.

     I suspect that you'll find I/O to be the bottleneck in any
"UNIX file tampering detector" -- the disks just can't deliver the data
fast enough.  For me, the above numbers drop by a factor of 2-3 if you
take into account disk I/O times.

     Note also that turning on profiling slows down code -- your code
will run faster with profiling turned off.

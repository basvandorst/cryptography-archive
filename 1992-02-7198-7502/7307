Bad move.

The encrypted file will lose its appearance of redundancy that compress
depends on.  Compression simply will not yield usable results.

It is better to compress the clear text first:

1.  You gain the ability to make use of the existant redundancy to make
    the file smaller.

2.  By making the file smaller before encryption, you save CPU cycles in
    the encryption process.  You might save enough CPU to move up to a
    better encryption algorithm or a longer more complex key.

3.  You hide redundancies in the clear text to a degree, making it more
    difficult to crack.

4.  The smaller data exposure further reduces the amount of working data
    a cracker will have to work with over the sum of your communications.

-1. Compression usually starts out with a small few bytes of predictable
    data.  You MIGHT overcome this by simply NOT encrypting the first
    4 bytes of the data.  This would give away your compression algorithm,
    but that is nothing secure in the first place.

Can't imagine why it would exist.

Hi,	
	I am looking for any references to Wavelets/Packets for encryption
that can be found anywhere.  Anonymous FTP sites that have papers
on the material would be extremely helpful.  I am looking for something
that is easy enough for the layman, but yet gets into enough detail so
that I would be able to code it up, ie formulas and explanations of
what is happening.  If you have any suggestions for where I might look
for this type of material please let me know.  Please e-mail me as
I don't read the group that much.  Thanks in advance,

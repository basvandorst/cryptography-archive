If you get a copy of "The Codebreakers", be sure to get the 
hard cover version.   The paperback edition is heavily abridged.
Also, "The Codebreakers" was published prior to the revelations
of the Polish/British breaking of Enigma during World War II.
"The Hut Six Story" by Gordan Welchman has excellent coverage of
that.  Also, Kahn has a new book out called "Stealing the Enigma"
or something like that.   It serves as a good update to
"The Codebreakers" on the Enigma breaks.

Are there any primers out there, either online or in print,
about the practical aspects of using encryption?  Does 
sci.crypt have a FAQ list (I've read it intermittently and haven't
seen one)?  Also, could any kind soul answer the following:

	Where are PD or free versions of DES available from?

	How would one use an encryption scheme to send
	encrypted email?

Thanks!

The fact that you're paranoid doesn't prove they're *not* out to get you.

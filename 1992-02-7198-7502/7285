Your distinction between data security and encryption is valid and sets
an appropriate context. Your example of a domain where "master keys"
are a requirement is also a good one, and probably applies a great deal
more often then that arena in which a dead key-holder and lost data is
preferable to compromised data. But it seems everyone wants to know that
their encryption system can handle the worst case (perhaps we still suffer
from the glorification of spys), so the issue becomes one of knowing that
a given vendor's encryption software doesn't contain any *undocumented*
backdoors. This applies to other kinds of security systems that do not
involve encryption as well (for example any password access protection),
and as far as I can see it is an issue only for security systems, and
not other kinds of software.

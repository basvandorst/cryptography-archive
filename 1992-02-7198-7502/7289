Gaargh. Where was that FAQ list?

All cryptographically secure generators produce sequences with
extraordinarily long periods. This does *not* mean that any generator
which produces a long period must be cryptographically secure. In fact,
almost exactly the opposite is true: most random number generators are
abominable from a cryptographic standpoint.

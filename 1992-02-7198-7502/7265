Yes, but it's not a back door for Central Point.  If I send you a file
and they intercept it, they don't get in.  It's a back door for me, or
someone who breaks into my apartment and makes a copy of the software
that has my master.

Security is lessened by using the master, but it is not as bad as some
people thought (i.e., that there was a back door available to the vendor
of the software).

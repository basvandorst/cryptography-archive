Not dumb, just not particularly useful.

It seems strictly better (when the person to be authenticated has cpu
power available in addition to brain power, as he/she must in this
case) to do the following:  the server sends a random bit string to the
user, who encrypts it and returns it.  Only someone who knows the
password can do this, only the password need be retained by each party.
A listener on the wire gets minimal information.

Or use public key encryption, in which case you don't even have to save
a copy of the password on the server (an uncool thing to do anyhow).

No all it requires is enough identical copies of the directory of keys
containing Dan's key to be recieved to exceed your threshold of
cululative trust.  Most of the good models for this I have seen end up
with someone publishing at least one and probably several keys widely
through many channels.   Some models have phone book sized documents
arriving from several sources for the truely concerned.

A paper documetn a cd, email, an ad in the new paper; enough different
channels with identical information and either you trust it or you
accept that there is a massive conspiracy to decieve you.

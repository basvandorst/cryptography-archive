Two corrections:

1.  People at NeXT (other than Steve Jobs during the keynote address) call 
the algorithm "Fast Elliptic Encryption".

2.  jim@rsa.com tells me that NeXT's motivation for going with FEE
had nothing to do with RSA's licensing fees, and that there was no
such discussion between NeXT and RSA Data Security.  The bit about
RSA's fees being too high was just an informal remark I heard, and was 
evidently misinformed.

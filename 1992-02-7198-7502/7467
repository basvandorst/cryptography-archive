John,

I would like to understand what there was in the previous discussion
that triggered such an emotional outburst.

Are you opposed to the idea that software developers should be compensated
for their effort and creativity? Or do you feel that copy protection
and license managers are inappropriate methods for ensure just payment
to the developers?

I use and install numerous commercial software packages, most of which
involve some variety of copy or execution limitations. I have no 
philosophical disagreements with this. If I (or the company that I work for)
buy a single-machine license and try to run it on several machines, then
I am stealling from the devlopers of that software. Since there is 
a significant amount of software piracy, I believe that the developers
are justified in using some form of protection.

This is not to say that I haven't had difficulties with copy protected
software. Many of the earlier forms were quite obnoxious because they
did not take into account the way real users operate - e.g. the need
to make backup copies, and replace/upgrade hardware. But this happened
because the designers were naive and short-sighted, not dishonest
and malicious.

The key issue is really whether or not the software vendors are
responsive to their customers. I work across network of UNIX 
workstations using a large variety of commercial software. Most
of this software is protected by some kind of license manager that
is keyed to particular machines by internal CPU serial numbers. 
When I have moved this software to a different machine, a quick 
phone call or FAX request has brought a new password within a few
hours. If you are not getting this kind of responsiveness, then
you should buy software from different companies rather than
disparaging all software developers that wish to protect their
commercial interests.

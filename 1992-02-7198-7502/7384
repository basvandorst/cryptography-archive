The problem with spoofing is that you have to intercept ALL
mail...building an airtight box around Dan.  If you can do that, I
doubt there's any way for him to break out.

All it takes is one path not intercepted to let people outside Dan's
box know that something is wrong.  A personal appearance at a
certificate center is one such path, but that path can be electronic.
For example, UUCP provides such paths -- as does FIDONET.

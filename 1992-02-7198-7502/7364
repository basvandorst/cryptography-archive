This is from the bio accompanying an article in the Western Union
Technical Review, April, 1958.

"Gilbert S. Vernam, Assistant to the Systems and Equipment Engineer,
graduated from Worcester Polytechnic Institute in 1914 with a B.S.
degree.  After 15 years with the AT&T Engineering Department, he
transferred to the International Communications Labs, and in 1932
to Postal Telegraph which later merged with Western Union.  While
with AT&T he invented a method of using printer equipment do
encipher and decipher messages automatically that is widely used by
our armed forces, and took part in the early development of the TWX
system.  For Postal he developed an automatic concentrator, and supervised
the development of the semiautomatic "torn-tape" relay system and its
installation in a number of switching centers for Postal and for the
Signal Corps and Navy; he also prepared a technical manual describing
the system for the Signal Corps.  More recently he has worked on the
development of push-button switching systems Plans 51 and 54 for
leased wire patrons and Plan 55-A for the Air Force.  Mr. Vernam
holds about 60 patents relating to telegraph systems.  He is a
Professional Engineer, a member of Tau Beta Pi, Sigma Xi and AFCEA,
and a Life Member of AIEE."

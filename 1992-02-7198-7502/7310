Exactly. Two (name,key) pairs can convince you that they're the same;
but there's absolutely no way for you to determine that two (name,key)
pairs are *not* the same. This isn't an accident, and it cannot be
corrected by a key distribution center. After all, any real person may
introduce any number of (name,key) pairs into the network, and each of
those (name,key) pairs can deny any association with the other. Only
something external to the network can detect this duplication.

So I guess the real question is ``What goes wrong if a man can lead two
separate lives?'' Is there any problem if one person adopts two separate
identities? Is there anything in the real world which depends on being
able to determine that two names refer to the same person? Voting is one
example, but voting security usually reduces to the security of a birth
certificate, and I don't think public-key cryptosystems will change
that.

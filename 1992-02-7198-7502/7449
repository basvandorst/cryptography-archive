If you need to have all the CDROM's identical, then just customise the tokens
for each copy of the CDROM driver software. Our system still depends on the
user calling in for a new authorisation code every few months, only now the
one authorisation code works for all his software rather than just one
package.

Remember that if someone does succeed in duplicating the driver, despite 
reasonable precautions, then either we'll get more than one request to 
re-authorise a single serial number (which we will refuse), or the copier
will have to set up an infrastructure to get these re-authorisation codes
from us and distribute them to his `customers', in which case he'll face
conspiracy charges when we finally catch him.

The risk of someone running a pirate operation can probably be reduced to as
near zero as required by additional tricks, such as always checking that the
CDROM is physically present when the software is run. We can do this by
putting a large (100MB plus) amount of challenge-reponse material on the
spare CDROM tracks which can be checked by a public key mechanism in the
software but which is too large to be economically copied on to the user's
hard disk.

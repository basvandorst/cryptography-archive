I am developing a security architecture suitable for
non-military, non-academic situations. It incorporates DES,
RSA, and the Diffie-Helman (Pohlig-Hellman) algorithms.

I've just come across an old (1990) reference to work by
BNR/Northern Telecom using similar techniques. Can anyone
provide specific references to that work and any comments or
reviews on it?

I also have a 1990 working draft from ISO SC21 titled "Access
Control Framework". Is there a net resource on ISO standards
information?

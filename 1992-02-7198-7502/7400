	Excellent!  I *love* the credit-card suggestion!
Unfortunately, it might be hard to implement... how do you know it's
a valid (user,name,card#,exp-date)-tuple?  And what does the user care
once the card is expired?  ...it might buy some time though.

	The beauty of your idea is in getting the user to incorporate
some sensitive information about *himself* into the package before it
will work.  That way, he(/she) has a vested interest in keeping it to
himself.  I like it.  I really like it.  Great idea.

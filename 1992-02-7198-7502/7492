The phrase 'encode each byte in my message' implies an ECB on 8-bit
chunks without chaining.  This reduces to substitution, and thus is
easy to break.  I know, you'd never do that.  But that's exaclty what
the user was worried about.

[The answer -- choose chunk of M s.t. associated number x < n, as
answered by Bob Silverman and myself deleted]

}So, the answer is for someone to implement Kerberos for DOS and Macs, and

I believe Kerberos (client lib) has already been ported to MS-DOS and
MACs (the code is really not that complicated) and the Internet Engineering
Task Force (IETF) has a subcommittee who has been working on secure telnet
for some time.  A draft RFC is a available.

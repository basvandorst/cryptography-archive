While it is true that the basic elliptic curve system isn't patented
(to the best of my knowledge), from a legal point of view it might
very well be considered derivative of the original Diffie-Hellman
system, and thus covered by their patent.  I'm not a lawyer, so for
any definitive response you should ask one :-(.

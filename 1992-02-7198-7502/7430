The question was, how to distribute data on CDROM in encrypted form, and
provide a decryption key to each customer, such that encryption does not
become a farce, and third parties cannot get sneak copies of the data.

One possible scheme would be a CD-ROM with a high number of distinct copies
of the same product, each encrypted. Let the customer buy a decryption key
separately for one of these copies, but hand out the CD essentially free
of charge. Ridiculous? Doing it straight, yes, but...

Imagine: Your product consists of a number of pieces (say a library of ANDF
coded modules). Select a small but crucial subset (let's call it the core).
Let that be 20KB is size (you may have compressed it), and encrypt this say
5000 times with different keys, giving 5000 * 20KB = 100MB of 'core files'
(assuming a (roughly) size preserving encryption). Now you have still 500MB
avaialable on your 600+MB CD-ROM for the main part, which is unusable without
a decrypted 'core file'. To use the CD, you will need a key to decrypt one
of the 'core files', and a utility (you put that also on the CD) to decrypt
the core and combine it with the rest of the product on disk. The latter one
may by the way also be encrypted, where is key for its decryption is in the
core file set. (That key is constant for all copies of the 'core file set'.)

What have we gained? Such a CD can be used to sell distinct copies on one
medium to a substantial number of customers. If we look at the necessary
interaction, the limited size of production run for such a CD, 5000 in this
example, looks right for me, at least for many application areas, where I
would consider such a scheme. Use your own envelope to get some similar
numbers, which fit better for your situation. There is no need to go too
high with the number of different 'core files' on one disk, because either
you have so many customers that you can't handle the key management (real
mass market), or you already have a new release of the data with a new CD
when you have exhaused the number of 'core files', or you can sell the key
for the same core file to multiple, but widely separated customers (you
have control of that by way of licencing / key distribution).  Finally,
you might even produce several such encoded CDs from the same data.
All considered, the production costs should be rather reasonable, if we
look at the range of copies contemplated above. It all depends on the
kind and the value of information. If do not target stable mass markets
with your product, where you want to sell 500,000 copies, this scheme
looks rather reasonable to me, e.g. for selling reusable software packages
to software houses, who build their stuff with these packages.

It's true that if I'm a leaf node in a network, then I have no choice but
to trust my neighbor. If he decides from the beginning to corrupt all my
messages, I cannot stop him, no matter what. A key distribution center
doesn't help---unless I have a *separate* channel to the center. And in
that case I'm no longer a leaf node in the network, so that the problem
goes away. It's not a central trusted authority that matters; it's
having multiple independent views of the world.

You're saying that I'm a leaf node. If so, then I'm under your power,
and having a key distribution center won't help.

In practice it never will happen. You can't control every channel by
which I communicate with the rest of the world. But if it does---if I
stay locked in one room for the rest of my life, communicating with the
world through a terminal---then, as far as everyone else is concerned,
the terminal is a black box, and the person who ``really'' controls it
is irrelevant.

Yesterday at a Toys 'R' Us I noticed a display of "spy" toys, made my Tyco.
Including such items as a small camera, a little transmitter and receiver
for tracking someone, and a black light for writing invisible messages,
there was a cipher wheel watch.

It's called the Spy Code Watch.  (Actually, the box says:  "Spy Tech Real
Working Spy Code Watch with Spy Accessories.")  It's a working watch with a
cipher wheel around the bezel.  A secret compartment under the watchface
holds three different wheels.  Each wheel can, of course, be arranged in 26
positions.  There's even a little light that aids in encryption/decryption
of messages.  An impressively-written instruction book comes with lots of
cover and deception tips.

I would have sold my sister for one of these when I was a kid, but one of
the benefits of being an adult is that I could easily plunk down $9.  If it
didn't look so incredibly dorkey, I would wear it every day.

Let me amplify this point a bit.  A patent has two main parts (to my
untrained eye), a description of the invention, and a set of claims.
The purpose of the description -- and it's more or less like a technical
paper, modulo legal weirdnesses -- is to ``teach'' others about the
invention.  It's supposed to be detailed enough that others with ``ordinary
skill in the art'' can build one.  The set of claims delineates what's
new and different.  A device infringes a patent if and only if it contains
all of the elements listed in any one claim.  Therefore, claims are
always made as broad as possible.  You may see a claim that says ``raise
this value to that power'' -- but if it doesn't specify that the value
is an integer, a variant that performed exponentiation in some other
field would quite possibly infringe.

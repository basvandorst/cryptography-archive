The answer is YES. It is irresponsible if that lock is going on you hose
(oops) house' door. Yes it is irresponsible if it goes on you safe. But,
no, it's no irresponsible if it's locking your brooms & cleaners. The 
question, as a bad analogy with door look, is not "is it irresponsible"
but "is it irresponsible in that case". Having a back door for my texts,
data or files that are MINE is irresponsible. Sharing data need shared
keys. Private data need private keys.

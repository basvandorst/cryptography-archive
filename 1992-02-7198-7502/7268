In article <1992Feb5.183526.14021@cunixf.cc.columbia.edu> you write:

                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Someone else gave Mathematica code for generating probable
primes.  I just wanted to comment on terminology:  pseudo-primes
is a really bad term.  Actually pseudo-primes are a well-defined
term that means (I think) the set of primes union the set of Carmichael
numbers.  What probabilistic prime number tests give are *probable*
primes (yes, I know some people don't like that terminology any
better) --- in this case when you have a number it's either (1) composite
and you know it, or (2) composite but you say it's a probable prime,
or (3) prime and you say it's a probable prime.

The point is that the only bad case is (2), and the probability
or this occuring is very, very, very small (can be made arbitrarily
small, in fact).

Some people call numbers that pass a probabilistic test "strong pseudo-primes",
but I still don't like that.  For some reason "pseudo-primes" (or
"fake-primes") seems like a very bad term for a test that, with high
probability, will toss out any and every composite number....

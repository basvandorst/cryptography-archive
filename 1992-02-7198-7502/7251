Actually this subject line is unfair, why is DE's software
any more vulnerable to these attacks than someone else's?

With regards to the 2nd and 3rd methods, see the paper 
Efficient Computation on Oblivious RAMs by Rafail Ostrovsky,
presented at the 1990 STOC.  This paper describes simulating
an arbitrary RAM with an Oblivious RAM with a poly-logarithmic
slowdown.  Such techniques may prove to be of practical importance
in guarding against the attacks described above.

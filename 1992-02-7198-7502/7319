This is for Ralph Merkle, if he reads this group.  If anyone at Xerox
sees this, I'd be grateful if you'd pass it along.

Ralph, what is the current status of Khufu and Khafre?
We certainly could do with efficient software encryption functions,
and yours seem to be appropriate.

A major problem with these algorithms seems to be that an initial
random S-box needs to be agreed by both parties.  In order to 
achieve compatibility between users, would it not be a good idea to
publish this inital S-box?  Perhaps we could agree to use the first
numbers from "A Million Random Digits with 100,000 Normal Deviates,"
but it is somewhat unlikely that every user of Khufu and Khafre 
would buy this tape.

People who want to generate their own initial S-box will still 
be free to do so, but those of us who need compatibility could all 
agree to use the "standard" one.  What do you think?

Cheers, Andrew.

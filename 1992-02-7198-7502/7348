The much more difficult problem is convincing all of the edit programs,
print spoolers, file viewers, directory movers, archivers, etc. to behave
the same way.  They often create temporary or back-up copies of files, then
delete them in the usual DOS way.  If you don't have it in the OS, and
can't control the importation/creation of such programs, you can't really
do it completely.

I have a program that uses splay-tree based compression (a sub-optimal
prefix code scheme that is faster than adaptive Huffman codes and
requires far less memory).  The overall performance of the compressor
is about half the speed of UNIX compress with comparable compression
quality when you ask it to use a 64 state source model.

The initial trees used by the compressor and expander default to balanced
trees, but you can perturb the trees with a password.  The tree is
perturbed by applying the adaptive compression algorithm to update the
tree for the successive characters of the password without transmitting any
data.  This must, of course, be done identically at the compressor and
expander, since the trees used at each end must remain identical as they
are adjusted to reflect each character transmitted.

To date, I know of no analysis of the security of this encryption scheme,
but I suspect that for passwords of 8 or more characters, it provides at
least useful encryption.

I have source code, and the basic ideas were published in ``Application of
Splay Trees to Data Compression,'' Communications of the Association for
Computing Machinery, 31, 8 (Aug. 1988) 996-1007.

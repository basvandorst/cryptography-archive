The design should also be subject to some formalism as well.  The

proven secure encryption algorithm.

This `special case' (chosen plaintext attack) is the usual attack to
consider when reasoning about the strength of a cryptosystem.  If (for
practical reasons) there is some weaker notion of security that you're
striving for, can you define it?  Can you then prove this notion of
security relative to the assumed strength of the hash function?  The
quoted paper proves the strongest common sense of cryptosystem
security using four rounds of hashing and shows that two rounds is
insufficient.  I think you're on the way to proving some weaker notion
using two rounds, but you haven't done it quite yet.

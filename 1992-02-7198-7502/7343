Implemented: Yes. Available: Not really.

Oh, sure. The only thing is, what do we do in the meantime? If I need
secure telnet/FTP *now*, I'd rather go ahead and implement a separate
solution rather than wait for "someone" to implement secure TCP/IP.
It's the wave of the future, but sometimes interim solutions are
necessary as well. 

(Thanks for the effort, btw.)

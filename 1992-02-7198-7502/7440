That's the entire problem.

What does it mean to be "sure of" someone's key?

All the cnetral signer can do is attest to some relationship.  (Eg.,
if keys are registered only after a personal visit, they could be
related to a person's fingerprints.  Does that help anyone?)

The gov't would want to be sure of the relationship between a key
["key"= unique identifier of an individual] and a security screening.
We're not the gov't.  What do you need to be sure of?

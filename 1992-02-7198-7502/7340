Now you're being silly, Herman. If you get confused at the sight of two
different people each claiming the name of Dan Bernstein, then I hate to
think how you'd react to fifty John Smiths. :-) As a matter of fact,
there are at least three Dan Bernsteins on the net; you can tell the
difference because we have different addresses. Now if we started using
three different public keys as well, there wouldn't be any question of
forgery. Nor would there be any confusion if---as I've been emphasizing
throughout this discussion---everyone made sure to transmit complete
(name,address,key) tuples, rather than just the ambiguous names. This is
practical because real-world communication is by rendezvous.

Folks,

I am looking for a citation on Rivest's MD5. So far what I've seen was an
informal writeup from RSA Inc. Has MD5 been published? RFC-ed?

While I am at it, I am also looking for a citation for a paper that criticized
MD4 at the last year's CRYPTO conference. I believe the paper was by Shamir.
(I'd love to get a copy of it too. Any ideas where I can get my hands on it?)

thanks y'all!

Gene

What is the correct or standard reference for the frequency of letters
in the English language?  A book by Lucky (Silicon Dreams) refers to the
standard table and produces it in his book.  Unfortunately, the sum
of percentages he cites adds to 0.9989 and not 1.00.  I can understand
some rounding error but I am suspicious.  I found another source that
gives a table for 10000 occurrences, and it seems slightly different
than the Lucky book.  The occurrences for the letter a are about 0.05
different.  What is the standard table?  Where can I find out more about
it?

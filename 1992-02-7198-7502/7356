Hi,

I'm not sure if this is the correct group for this question, if not would someone please point me in the right direction.  I have a number of users who feel that they have data that is too sensitive to go unencrypted over a broadcast medium such as ethernet.  

They will be using PC class machines as terminals going over ethernet to IBM mainframes.  What they want me to do is find some way to encrypt everything that goes to the ethernet and then unencrypt it on the IBM end.  I have no idea where to start looking.  Any suggestions of software/hardware or where to look for ideas would be greatly appreciated.


Thanks in advance,

Ron Tipton

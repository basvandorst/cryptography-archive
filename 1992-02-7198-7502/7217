Peter, are you saying what I think you're saying?  You seem to be saying
that you believe that encryption software SHOULD include a trap door.
From this, should I imply that Dolphin's encryption software contains a
trap door?  This would, of course, make it necessarily insecure.  It seems
to me that anyone who markets a security product has a responsibility to
try to make it secure.  To include in any such product a mechanism to allow
the creator special access seems unethical at best.  Any such mechanism
could allow a third party (or an unethical creator) access to an unsuspecting
customer's supposedly-securly-encrypted data.  

Please clarify Dolphin's position if you can.  Does Dolphin's software
contain such a trap door?

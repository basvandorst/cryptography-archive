This won't work. See below.

This is false.  Please explain why you think it is true.

:
:M is the full text of your ASCII message. This might seem impossible to do,
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is false as well. Letting M be the entire text will not work if
the message has more bits than n. You will map a number k > n down
to something less than n and bits will be lost. There will be no way to
recover the original message.


What one REALLY does is to break your message into pieces of
any convenient length less than the modulus.


:because M would then be a huge number, and M^d astronomically so. In
 
Except you are working mod n!!! M^d  mod n will be no longer than n!!

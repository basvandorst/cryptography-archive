Thanks all; I have gotten a good suggestion on how to track down the email
address, an explanation of why we would not be able to call them on a 
secure line anyway, and a suggestion of some alternate investigative 
agencies for us to contact locally.

One writer expressed concern that the NSA is trying to squash publication 
of grant-related research; I believe this does happen, but not in this 
case.  The NSA is funding a very worthwhile (IMO) foreign-language related 
project which as I said is not secret.  More than that I do not want to say 
until my wife can talk to someone.

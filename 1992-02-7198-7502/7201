This is addressed quite adequately by secret sharing protocols.

See Shamir's paper in CACM Nov 1979, vol 22, # 11, p 612,
		"How to Share a Secret"

It's a simple method of giving out information to N people such that any K
of them can agree together to reconstruct the secret.

So -- if you're encrypting company files, send the key out to the corporate
officers and keep it yourself.  If you get hit by a truck, the company can
recover its own data -- but it can't recover your torrid love letters
to/from the president's secretary.  If on the other hand you use a
"slightly weak" encryption system, ....

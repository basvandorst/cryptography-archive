I think the easiest schemes are ones where there are one or more central
sites who publish lists (signed with their key) of other people's public
keys.   In this case, all you really need to know for *sure* is that

a) You have the central signer's public key, and
b) You trust that central signer not to publish somebody's key that they
   are not sure of.

Can't help you on "b" of course.

If *all* your communication from central signers goes through one
intermediary, then yes, they could impersonate that central authority
by sending you a fake version of the central signer's public key.

But all you need is one other channel (or as many as you like) for this
one datum every so often.   This channel can be slow and expensive as you
only need a small bit of data on an irregular basis.  It is hard to imagine
a system where several such channels, from direct phone calls, to postal
mail to personal visits would not be available.

For a secure system you do want to be able to get keys regularly.  In a
secure system public keys should expire with time, so that if they are
compromised, and you don't find out about it, the compromise is not
permanent.  The time limit varies on how much security you want and how
frequently you can use your independent channels.  I could see military
sites expiring keys in a very short time, others letting them last a year.

[This also is a nice commercial hook for the central signer -- you have to
keep coming back for the service.]

	Make them pay for the product with the card, and get a proper
authorization from TRW and all that....
	Further, make the license contain verbiage to the effect that
by using his credit card to pay, he is agreeing that he will pay licensing
on all copies of the software that are running using that credit card, and
that they can be billed accordingly...

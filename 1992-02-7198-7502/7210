Here's the low end: On this Sun, the des program runs at 23K/sec, crypt
runs at 200K/sec, and snuffle runs at 56K/sec. Similar ratios hold on
most platforms, though of course Phil's des program runs somewhat faster
than Sun's version. I don't know too much about the extremely-high-speed
DES implementations out there. Certainly a DES chip helps a lot.

snuffle has 256^64 possible primary keys, 256^55 possible secondary
keys, and 256^64 possible time-keys. I win :-). (The time-key is an
important addition---it can be something public like the date plus a
pseudo-random number, as long as it's different for every message. It
reduces the damage that a plaintext attack can do. Other than that, key
length really doesn't matter, as long as keys aren't ridiculously
short.)

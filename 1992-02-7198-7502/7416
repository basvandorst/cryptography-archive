Currently we are in the process of examining the use of video conferencing
systems.  For good or bad they use DES to encrypt the data between sites.
But they pass the DES keys to each other using Galois theorem.  The only
thing I know is that Everiste Galois is the mathemetician who devised this
for improving algebraic computations.  Now is this methodology really a 
secure method of passing keys, or is just that very few people know about
Galois operations, and are counting on the obscurity for the protection.

Such systems tend to be variants of the Diffie Hellman and El Gamal systems
you'll find in the standard textbooks. Their feature is that you do crypto
by exponentiation in a finite group. The innovation is that you don't use
the `standard' cyclic group of nonzero integers modulo some number, but a
group associated with an algebraic extension of the rational numbers. This
is where the Galois connection comes in.

See `A Key-Exchange System Based on Imaginary Quadratic Fields', J Buchmann
and H C Williams, Journal of Cryptology vol 1 p 107 - 118.

> [How not to send cleartext passwords over a network?]

If you trust both machines, they can use encryption to obtain a secure
channel over an insecure network, and send the password over that.  Not
too satisfying.

Eventually we'll all carry smartcards containing a private key, which can
authenticate us to the remote machine by, say, cryptographically signing the
date and time.  You never have to give away your private key, ever.  If
humans were smart enough, we could just do this in our heads.  Tough luck,
we're too stupid.

I've heard of a cool solution that is in use now, though:  a little box
with a numeric keypad that will DES a number for you with a stored key.
You log in to your remote machine by a query-response protocol:  your
machine sends you a random number, and you return its DES encryption by
typing the number into your little box and entering the result displayed
on a small LCD.

Any individual user can do this, by buying the little box and fiddling 
his login sequence.  This is great because it doesn't require the whole
world to agree on how to do things.


I always admire a simple workable solution.

The Norton Utilities version 6.0 has some really nice security
packages for MS-DOS that address all of these problems. First, there's
"wipeinfo".  Not only can it wipe a file by overwriting the blocks
with a fixed pattern, it can wipe the unused blocks in a file system.
This makes it very useful for getting rid of those deleted editor
temporaries. Also, it can wipe the "file slack", the extra space
beyond the end of a file that brings it up to the next cluster
boundary. Run these two operations and a raw disk read utility won't
find anything that isn't in an actual file.

To keep plaintext off the disk in the first place, there's DISKREET, a
pseudo-disk driver that creates a fully encrypted filesystem out of an
ordinary (but hidden) file in a real disk. But as I mentioned before,
I do not know the internal layout of a DISKREET filesystem or whether
any kind of a "trap door" has been built in, e.g., to allow Norton to
recover the filesystem of a user who has forgotten his/her key.
Perhaps Norton should be asked to release this information.

Yet another way to keep plaintext, including editor temporaries, off a
disk is to create a RAM disk and do all your editing there. With the
amount of RAM on most MS-DOS machines these days, a RAM disk is about
the only way you can really make use of it anyway.  Of course, you had
better have a reliable machine and power supply to keep you from
accidentally losing your data...

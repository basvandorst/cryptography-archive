I once again claim that all the supposed ``problems'' of distributing
public keys in an insecure network can and should be solved without a
key distribution center. *Whenever you distribute a name and address,
distribute a public key along with it*.

In article <10394@cactus.org> ritter@cactus.org (Terry Ritter) writes:

This is ridiculous. Anyone who wants should be able to create a public
key for any occasion, without the interference of some central group.
Why not?

(Dan Bernstein, brnstnd@nyu.edu, key fdsahkfdsahfdsa, expires March 1992)
hereby asserts (signed in his own public key) that (Dan Bernstein,
brnstnd@nyu.edu, key 123674932, expires June 1993) is the same person,
and vice versa. End of problem. Two distinct (name,address,key) pairs
can always convince you that they're the same person, given
cryptographically secure signatures.

On a smartcard which you carry with you. It's just an ID card; don't
lose it.

Who cares? If keys expire quickly enough, then the risk that any of them
will be compromised is acceptably small.

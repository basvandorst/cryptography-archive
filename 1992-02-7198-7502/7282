I have been working with MD-4 for some time and I agree with the fast
speed figures others have mentioned for the better CPU architectures.
MD-4 (and MD-5) were clearly designed for machines with lots of 32-bit
registers, and it blazes on them (e.g., Sparc). Unfortunately it runs
much more slowly on brain-damaged, register-starved 16-bit environments
like the Intel chips, and there doesn't seem to be much you can do about
it. It certainly would help, though, if the standard MS-DOS C compilers
had a "386" mode to at least let MD-4 use what few 32-bit registers ARE
available on the 386 and 486.

But all this is relative. Even MD-4 runs far faster than DES on Intel
chips. A year or so ago I devised a cipher that used MD-4 as its
nonlinear function.  Even though it used MD-4 much less efficiently
than in its intended purpose, my cipher ran 4x DES's speed on the
Intel machines, and 13x the speed of DES on Sparcs.

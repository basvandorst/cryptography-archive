I think we risk igniting the old "security through obscurity" flame
again.  But in this case I think it's worth pointing out that there's
really very little excuse not to do encryption right if in fact you're
going to do it at all.

Doing encryption wrong is worse than not doing it at all, because few
things are as dangerous as a false sense of security.  On my own
personal moral scale, I consider building a deliberately weak
encryption system to be much worse than distributing a package that
attacks it in the hope of alerting the public to the dangers.

It's like asking whether it's worse to build deliberately shoddy door
locks, or to sell lock picks. At least the lock pick salesman doesn't
misrepresent his products to his customers.

I would definitely distribute the PKZIP-cracking software. The bad
guys will get it anyway (or probably already have), so the good guys
might as well learn that it exists.

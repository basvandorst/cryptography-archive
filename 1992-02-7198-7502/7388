I'm looking for a scramble function that, given a range of integers 0...m-1,
maps any integer n in that range into a unique f(n) in a way that is both
bijective and completely "discontinuous"; that is, for some nonzero k it
must be the case for all n that
	f(n + 1) != f(n) + 1, f(n + 2) != f(n) + 2 .... f(n + k) != f(n) + k
and
	f(n - 1) != f(n) - 1, f(n - 2) != f(n) - 2 .... f(n - k) != f(n) - k
The function must be `pure'; that is, it cannot save state between calls (that
is why a conventional pseudo-random number generator won't do).

Ideally, this function should also have the property that if m factors into
2 primes p * q, |n1 - n2| < k implies both (n1 mod p) != (n2 mod p) and (n1
mod q) != (n2 mod q) for some k > 0.

The inverse need *not* be difficult to compute.  :-)

I have some vague idea that this can be done with prime powers and modular
arithmetic, but I don't remember enough number theory to be sure.

Respond via email please, I'll summarize.

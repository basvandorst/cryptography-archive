Phil's exact system was presented and broken in the cryptographic
literature.  See the paper "How To Construct Pseudorandom Permutations
from Pseudorandom Functions", Siam J. Comput., Vol 17, No. 2, April
1988.

The paper shows that Phil's system is insecure, but that using two
rounds of his system (with different keys) results in a secure system.

Perhaps a comment from a layman wouldn't be taken amiss. Wouldn't it
be possible that a company might want to have a level of security
safe enough to ensure the privacy of its files but with the assurance
that the privacy does not open the comapany to potential large
losses.

Perhaps a strong cryptographic technique could be used in a weak
way for certain types of files. The comapanies personnel records
could be encrypted in DES (say) with a restricted range of keys.
If the specific key were lost the company could be assured of
recovering the data in a reasonable period of time.

An intruder would be deterred by the same amount of effort.
This is the same argument I hear about the strenght of
the required decryption being proportional to the value
of the data only in a reverse manner.

A program which could perform encryption with guarantees on
the complexity of data recovery in face of loss of the key
could be useful in commercial situations (IMHO anyway).

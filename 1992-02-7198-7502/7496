This is a very bad assumption and also is  bit self-serving.
These encryption and password systems are useful to protect against
the kind of threat that comes with uninvited browsers and  even most business
competitors.  These people are not codebreakers or hacking specialists
and when they see a file thats not cleartext or something close they don't
bother to mess with it.  But suppose you arm these people with a 
shareware password cracker or decipher tool?  They are helpless 
without you assistance. 

I don't excuse people who don't understand their threat environment
and use a poor security system against  a sophisticated threat.
But lets face it, without Philips attempt to heighten the inherent 
contradictions of the system these spreadsheets and archivers  would 
do just fine against non-specialists.

Knowledgable people will start using stronger methods, but most won't bother.

Be careful your not about to pave that road with good intentions.

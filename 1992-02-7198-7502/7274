Apologies for posting to this group, since it is not strictly on-topic.
But since it is at least widely believed that the NSA reads this news 
group:

Can someone please tell me how to contact the NSA via e-mail?  Or how to 
find a "secure line" to call them from Hawaii?  My wife tried to contact
them on the phone, and was told she was not allowed to talk to their
Security department because we don't have a secure line (as our home
phone?!?)  She sent them a registered letter and has not yet received a 
response -- I assume they are allowed to receive letters?

This is not a crackpot thing, and we don't think we've uncovered a nest of 
enemy spies or any such nonsense; there are some irregularities connected 
with a (non-secret) grant of theirs which need to be investigated.  Any 
serious suggestions would be appreciated; it would be particularly nice if 
someone *FROM THE NSA SECURITY DEPARTMENT* would call us up at home and 
tell us how we can talk to them.  (Hint, hint.)

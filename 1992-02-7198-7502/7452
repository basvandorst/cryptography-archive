Let me see if I get this straight -- if I've bought software using this
guy's scheme and I add a new disk to my computer, I have to pay
$1.95/minute to call some 900 number so that the software that I have
already bought and paid for will continue to work?  I think I'll take my
business to someone who actually wants it.

This is exactly the kind of nonsense which has made copy protected
software disappear from the PC marketplace, and there's no reason to think
it'll be any more successful in the workstation arena.  Schemes that
attempt to identify individual computers based on details of hardware
configuration simply don't work.

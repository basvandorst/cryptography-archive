There is indeed a rec.puzzles FAQL server at netlib@peregrine.com; 
it has serviced to-date over ten thousand requests, and is still going
strong.  All I can suggest is to try your request again.

For those looking to see what is in the index, send an email message
with the line:
send index
in the body of the text to netlib@peregrine.com.

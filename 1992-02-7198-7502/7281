See Knuth, Volume II or any good textbook on probability and statistics.
These tests are inadequate for verifying pseudo-random number generators
for cryptography but fine for looking checking randomness of data acquired
elsewhere.

You can start by computing entropy --

	E = - sum( i, p(i)*log(p(i)) )

If you use log base 2, this is number of bits per alphabet character, i.


Beyond this, you need to be more specific.

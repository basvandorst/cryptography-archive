I am writing a program in C on HP-UX, I called it ``ccc'', it is a ``file
tampering detector'', something I felt there was a great need for in the Unix
community.
The program first scans the files we want to be tampering-protected, records
their attributes like st_size, st_mtime and size, then calculate a checksum.
Then all the file-records are enciphered and saved, using DES in CBC mode.
If a file changes some way you can detect the changes when you decode
the records database and compare the records with the real file attributes.
There are lots of options and facilities to make the checking process
easy and fast.

THE PROBLEM IS: SPEED, WHEN CALCULATING THE CHECKSUMS. I first tried MD4,
confident that it is one of the fastest secure widely known message digest
program, but it is unacceptably slow:

[gmon(1) output]
%time cumsecs seconds   calls  msec/call name    
 55.2    4.06    4.06     729       5.57 MD4Update
 36.0    6.71    2.65   87727       0.03 Transform

Then I tried CRC32, a very common algorithm used everywhere, but I have doubts
about its security, if not unsecurity at all. (Could someone please tell me
about the security of CRC32?). Also CRC32 is unacceptably slow:

[gmon(1) output]
%time cumsecs seconds   calls  msec/call name    
 88.7    4.07    4.07     606       6.72 UpdateCRC

So, what could I do? The program is ready to be published, it only lacks
some performance due the slowness of CRC32 and MD4. Are there any other
message digest algoritms providing a ``non-high'' security that are very
fast? Hints, anyone?

Ciao,	David

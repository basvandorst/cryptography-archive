 What an EGO trip... It is not like you discovered/invented something
 new or useful. At best you broke some bureaucratic code for assigning
 license plates. Big deal. If you have some trivia to share, fine then
 share it. If you are so obsessed with obtaining recognition where none
 is due then at least stop wasting bandwidth with your idle, vacuous
 boasts.

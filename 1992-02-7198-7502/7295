I would argue that what your exact application for the locks which you
buiy from a vendor does not determine whether he is being irresponsible
by selling you a system with master and sub-master keys.  If making a
purchase for an application which requires some aspect of "security"
which having masters and sub-masters would defeat (and not having
investigated this issue, I am not asserting that such aspects exist),
*YOU* are being irresponsible in choosing his line of locks and he would
be *NEGLIGENT* if he did not clearly outline this fact in advertising.

Thanks, Marc, for injecting some sanity into this thread.  I'm the one who
started this thread, after all, by pointing out the existance of a Usenet
news feed site that systematically spoofed all messages it passed thru. 
Dan and Carl's ideas do not address this problem.

It isn't even necessary for the spoofing site to spoof _all_ the mail
coming from Dan.  It is only necessary to substitute the "almost Dan"
public key in all the postings (and mail) from Dan THAT ARE SEEN BY ME (or
any other single individual), and to substitute the "almost Nelson" public
key in the postings (and mail) of mine that are seen by Dan.

It's true that if I see postings from Dan that bear different public keys
than the ones I've recently used in corresponding with him, then this
information is sufficient to inform me that spoofing may be occurring, but
ONLY IF I PAY ANY ATTENTION TO IT.  But I'm not likely to remember the
public keys of all my correspondents.  I'm not likely (and, IMhO, neither
is anyone else) to engage in the practice of examining the public key in
every email and posting to ensure that it matches the values seen
elsewhere.  So, if my software that reads News and email, and mails replies
to both, is made to have perfect memory of all the triples ever used in
any email and postings ever read, then there is a higher probability that
it will detect some spoofs, eventually, than if it doesn't have such a
memory.  But for one-shot exchanges of email with someone who posts rarely
(i.e. not Dan ;) it doesn't afford much protection against spoofers.

In repsonse to the idea that mail is addressed to a public key, I say, No,
when I send a reply to someone whom I've never encountered before, except
by the one posting to which I am replying, I do _not_ (and will not)
consider my reply to be addressed to the public key borne by the posting,
nor to "whoever owns it", because "whoever owns it" might very well be a
spoofer.


In another posting on this thread, someone suggested that citizens of third
world contries might not trust their governments' public-key distribution
hierarchies.  I suggest that the citizens who should be most conerned are
the citizens of the countries with the most technical sophistication and
with the greatest history of covert domestic and international operations.  
I for one would be _much_ happier to have my keys being disseminated by
Joe's Trusted Key Emporium and Tonsorial Parlour (1-900-GET-KEYS) than 
by some 3-lettered Agency of the US Gummint.

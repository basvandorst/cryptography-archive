An interesting example of "security by hardware configuration" is the
(otherwise excellent) IBM PC program MAVIS BEACON TEACHES TYPING.  It
makes a snapshot of your PC's configuration -- hardware and software --
at install time, and zealously compares that information to current
reality at run time thereafter.  If it sees a mismatch, it refuses to run.

The consequences, even to legitimate users, can be annoying.  My wife
bought it for her TI2000 notebook computer, which has a plug-in external
floppy drive.  We plugged in the drive and installed the program OK; tried
running it, no problems.  Unplugged everything and put it away.  Next
day she was on the plane and wanted to practice typing.  No can do!  The
floppy drive wasn't plugged in; MAVIS saw the hardware "mismatch" and
refused to run.  Same thing when we added another 2MB of memory, and the
card modem.  You even had to start out in the same display mode (B/W
80x25, color 80x43 or whatever) that the initial install was run from!

I haven't hacked a program to neuter its security in many years, but I
was sorely tempted this time :-)

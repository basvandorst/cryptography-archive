FEAL is supposed to be much faster than DES and providing a comparable
security level. I missed the abstracts of Eurocrypt 87 so I do not much
about the algorithm. Anyway I've heard it was cryptanalyzed by B. Den Boer
(with contributions by Shamir?). Furthermore I read about a `Call for Attack',
on Crypto-89. So, what is the FEAL ``status''?

Ciao,	DAvid

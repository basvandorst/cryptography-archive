This is a problem only if you think of Dan Bernstein as being addressed
only by the character string "Dan Bernstein".  If, however, you record
his name as ("Dan Bernstein",<public key>) and accept any changes to
that pairing only from someone who has the private half of that public
key, then you'll always be talking to the same Dan Bernstein.

None of this says anything about what that person's driver's license says.

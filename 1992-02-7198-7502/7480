Yes, if he chooses all the same exact ones.  Hit a few of them and at least
you might be able to disguise it.

Authenticating it, however, might be a different matter.

I could take the bit pattern of my own copyright statement in ASCII,
then in some sequence find places in a copy of some commercial software
where things were changeable, and put my own copyright into it, or
even claim the current state *IS* my copyright by carefully selecting
the ones that can be so claimed (e.g. lower binary instruction before
a higher one means 0, else 1).

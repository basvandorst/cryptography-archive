	Well if he puts the same master key in with every lock he sells,
then what are the locks worth? Now If he's really careful and doesn't let
unauthorized people get masters from him, he's still exposed to the risk
that it may be easier to create an unauthorized master than to pick his
locks. (Chain only as strong as it's weakest length and all that...)

	Car thieves for years exploited knowledge that there were only a
small number of possible keys for certain makes of cars, and constructed
special devices called 'gun keys' which could bypass the door and ignition
security. This surely happened more often than any 'legitimate' use of this
system.

	It all boils down to what the intended purpose of the security is,
i.e. is it casual (as the expression says, locks keep the honest man out) or
is it serious (onerous liability in case of breach). If you're the one keeping
the terrorists out of the nerve gas, or generating sample numbers for AIDS
test results, or anything else where it _really_ matters, then it stands to
reason that you'll be willing to forego the convenience of a 'weakened'
system in favor of the convenience of sleeping well at night.

Does anyone have any comments on whether using RSA in block
chaining with a known public key would result in a good hash
if the private key remained unknown?

I suppose that if the private key were known then the hash
could be "run in reverse" and opened to attack as is apparently
the case for block chaining for DES with a known key.  How
good would the "RSA hash" be then?

I am looking for a basic primer on cryptology fundamentals as well as current
cryptology trends and issues such as public key encryption, DES, pads, etc, 
etc, etc.  

If anyone has a paper ftp'able, that'd be great.  If not, any pointers to
info on-line or hardcopy would be fine too.

Thanks in advance,
Mark

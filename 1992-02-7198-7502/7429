Can someone help me out??

I'm trying to locate a reference that I'd seen years back concering
an encryption scheme for a very early electromechanical Faxs machine.
It may have been somewhere in Kahns codebreakers but I can't remember.

It went something like this:

The inventors of a very early fax system set up a circuit from 
Berlin to Rome that tranversed some part of France. The French 
security folks were, of course, interested in this new hi-tech
image system and so they reproduced an analog of the fax machine
and began monitoring the transmissions. Somehow word got back to
the original inventors that their image transmissions weren't
exactly private so seeing a new challenge they set out to build 
a scrambler.  The idea they settled upon was to introduce into the
drum-motor drive mechanism a set of additional cams and gears.
When these cams and gears were "active" the drum would no longer
rotate at a constant speed but would zig zag back and forth in a
complicated way. Someone intercepting such a scrambled transmission
and who lacked the cams and gear mechanism would get something looking like
modern art.  

Not much by todays standards but maybe it did the job for a short while.
Any information would be greatly appreciated.

            -H.

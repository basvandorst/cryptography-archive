There is exactly ONE problem with the distribution of public keys
in an insecure, or even a very secure, network, assuming that the
ciphers are essentially unbreakable.  That is that of authentiticy
of the person named as the holder of the private key associated with
the public key.  There is no intrinsic way for me to tell that the
Dan Bernstein posting the article referred to is not Joe Bftsplk, and
it would take someone trusted who could authenticate the fact to 
provide conclusive proof that this is in fact the case.

Does anyone have software already written to be patched into SunOS 4.1.1,
SCO UNIX SYSV/386 3.2r2 ODT 1.1, MSDOS 3.3/4.01/5.0, or Apple MacOS SYS7
which would prevent users from compromising confidential data by simply
opening without writing large files and reading the previous contents of 
the disk space allocated for their use?  VMS had an optional daemon that 
would zero the contents of disk files before previously occupied blocks
were reallocated to other users -- when a file was deleted, these blocks
would be placed on a dirty free list, zeroed by a background process and
only then moved to the clean free list for reallocation.

Curiously, no common system security book, article, or even a government
orange book seems to either mention or give a solution for this problem.

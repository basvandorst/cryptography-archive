I'm investiging methods of encrypting ascii files that will then be
U*IX compress'ed and then tar'red.  Someone told me they heard of a
 compress program that also did the encryption.

Does anyone know if such a beast exists and if so, any further
information on what encryption it uses.

Thanks in advance,
Mark

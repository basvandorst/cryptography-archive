I have just started learning about the RSA encryption method. The
text I am reading, although very thorough, does omit one very important
point. This is probably quite trivial, but I would appreciate it if
someone would answer the following question:

Assume that M is the message I want to send. The encrypted message
under RSA is

	M^d mod n

where d and n are chosen appropriately.

But what is M? It is a number, of course, but how does it relate to
my message? Is it my entire message in ASCII seen as one great
several-thousand-digit number? Or do I encode each byte in my message?
(That would be incredibly easy to break.) Or do I encode each 32-bit
portion of my message? Or what?

Thanks in advance!

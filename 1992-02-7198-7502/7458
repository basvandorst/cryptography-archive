Hello, fellow net people!

I recently acquired a backup program that has "DES Encryption".  As
part of the process of accessing an archive, you are required to enter
your "DES Password".  This is then validated by using it to decode a
"catalog" that has been encrypted by using the same DES key, and doing
a "reality check" on the resulting information.

How easily can the DES key be recovered if you have access to the
catalog, and you have information on what the un-encrypted file is
supposed to contain?

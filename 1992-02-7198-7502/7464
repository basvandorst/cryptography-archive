Great, so every time I want to run a program distributed on the CDROM
but then copied to my hard disk, I must re-insert the CDROM for
verification? So, for example, if my favorite typeface is distributed
on a CDROM, then every time I turn on my computer and use the font,
then I must re-insert the CDROM? What a loser of an idea. Copy
protection is doomed for the garbage heap of software history unless
and until someone comes up with a painless method of verification that
without requiring any time-wasting user input, always works for the
legitimate user despite modifications to his other hardware/software.
Schemes involving toll calls, credit card numbers, user input etc.
just won't sell as long as other less paranoid software companies
provide similar software without the hassle.

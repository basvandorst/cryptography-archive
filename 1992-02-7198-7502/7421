It would be a good hash, if somewhat inefficient.

If you're using DES as a hash function the thing to do is to use the
data to be hashed as the key, with a known plaintext.  That can't be
reversed (modulo differential cryptanalysis, but that's a different
story.)  It is possible, however to generate collisions because the
DES key is too short for this purpose.

Pretty poor :-)

Better not to use the product of two primes as the modulus.  Use a
single (strong) prime, which turns the inversion problem into discrete
log modulo a prime.  This problem is generally reckoned to be about as
difficult as factorization, and you don't have to trust anyone to
destroy the private key.

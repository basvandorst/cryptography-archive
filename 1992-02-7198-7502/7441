Ah, now we get to the crux of the matter.

Forget encryption, public or private.

What if you decide to reply to me by sending to thvv@tandem.com rather
than cme@sw.stratus.com?  Surprise!  It goes to the wrong person.

Gee.  I guess you have to check nearly meaningless strings of
characters.  :-)

                ==============================

Of course, what I do is keep an alias file.  I now have both the
person's net address and a local file where I save mail to/from that
person.  In the future, my alias file would also have what I believe
to be the person's key.

Given that, I frankly don't care what gets appended to USENET postings
by some FIDONET gateway.  Nobody's going to modify my alias file that
way.

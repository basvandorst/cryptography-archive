Terry seems to be assuming that (1) he doesn't have a secure network and
(2) he doesn't have a secure cryptosystem. I agree that it's very
difficult to achieve any security under these circumstances.

Yes, Terry: if you lose your keys, then someone else can get into your
house. Electronic keys are actually much nicer than physical keys since
it's easy to keep part of an electronic key in your head. Joe Shmoe
might have three copies of his current smartcard; if one is stolen,
there's still no security risk, as nobody but Joe knows his password.
Joe expires his smartcard immediately and calls the card company for a
new one. To get around this security would be much more difficult than
credit card fraud.

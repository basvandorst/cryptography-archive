I've been beta-testing Crack4.1 and I also run a DEC5500 with
UltrixV4.2.  Two weeks ago, we changed the security level to
"UPGRADE", so our supply of "regular" passwords is diminishing nicely.
However, I'd like to continue to monitor our usage of easy-to-guess
passwords; partly to instill in our users a sense of what is and is
not a reasonable password.  No flames, please, if you disagree with
this policy -- this is an internal matter which has been widely
discussed internally.  I *am* aware of npasswd and I'm trying to get
it working on our system under the new password regime.

The higher levels of Ultrix security make use of the crypt16() library
routine, which generates a longer output and takes up to 16 characters
of input.  For example, crypt16 ("J. Random Luser", "fu") yields
'fu2YsEt./jxv2umFJlATod6s' and takes 19 milliseconds.  This is about
the same speed (to within measurement accuracy) as crypt() so it is
unlikely to be doing much more work.  As UFC runs at 0.7 milliseconds
on this machine, I'd like to know how to alter it to emulate
crypt16().

Can anyone tell me how crypt16() works, in terms specific enough to
let me extend UFC?  Working code, of course, would be wonderful.

Yes, I have RTFM.  TFM says that crypt16() is identical to crypt()
except for the longer input and output strings.

>Does sci.crypt have a FAQ list?


Sorry.  I sent out a preliminary FAQ a few months ago to get comments
and then post it as the real sci.crypt FAQ.  I got beaucoup comments
and have a stack of editing still to do to it.

Mea culpa.  I'll try to get it edited and out in the next few weeks.
It's amazing how time flies when you're working .....

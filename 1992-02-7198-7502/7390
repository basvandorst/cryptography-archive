I agree that it's "pretty hard" to put a box around Dan and intercept
all his means of communication (unless, of course, he's careless and
always communicates through his workstation...like many people find it
convenient to do).

You point out that Dan can find a path to the world at large, he can discover
the counterfeit and ensure that he can get messages successfully to the
outside world.  This is true, and very useful.  But it's very much harder to
discover spoofing that is directed at, say, a single recipient rather than
the entire world.  If I spoof Dan to Carl by intercepting everything at
Carl's end, then Dan can't check for it:  instead, Carl must know to check
Dan's key against a public reference through separate secure means.  This
is probably not acceptable.  It certainly wasn't Dan's proposal.

---

So I conclude that Dan is "mostly secure" unless an adversary targets a
_particular_ recipient, in which case he could be spoofed by focusing
the attack on the recipient.  In that case, the Dan that Carl sees is
not the Dan that the rest of the world sees.

This ain't the stuff that secure systems are made of.

	Oh, horsesh**. If one has the proper privs, scanning terminal
clists is merely an excercise in programming. Just to be contrary, I'll
argue that running under SOD, er, DOS, is *MORE* secure than UNIX, since
you don't have as much to worry about about background daemons peering
at your memory buffers, or other users lurking in the background. You're
only running one job at a time, and you're not going to get swapped to
disk or anything like that...

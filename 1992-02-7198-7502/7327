Hello world.

 As a computer-science-student at the university of Aarhus (Denmark) I
 suddenly found myself in a position where I had to do arithmetic in large 
 Galois-fields and the polynomial-rings over such fields.

 Instead of writing C-routines to handle this myself,
 I would like to ask all of you, if you know of any such routines.
    
 What I would like is one or more C or C++modules implementing:
  +-----------------------------------------------------------+
  | 1) Multiprecision integer arithmetic modulo some prime p.  \
  |    (+,-,*,/ in GF(p) for arbitrary prime p).		\
  |      							 +
  | 2) Given:							 |
  |     a) routines for +,-,*,/  in a field F			 |
  |     b) irreducible polynomial f in the polynomial-ring F[X]	 |
  |								 |
  |    Return routines for:	          			 |
  +     A) +,-,*, division with remainder in F[X]		 |
   \    B) +,-,*,/ in F[X]/(f)					 | 
    +------------------------------------------------------------+

 Or something similar. 
   

 I had a thought:
   Maybe 2) was better implemented as classes in C++? 

 If you can enlighten the darkness in which I find myself engulfed, please 
 mail me: sanddal@daimi.aau.dk.
 
 Still I'm not desperate, but any hints solving (part of) this
 problem are most welcome. 
 

 /Niels

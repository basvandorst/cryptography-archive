No. Simply take it as axiomatic that your public key is part of your
name. Almost all communication is either face-to-face or by rendezvous.
In the first case, you can exchange names, including public keys,
directly. In the second case, whoever told you about each other is
responsible for transmitting complete names, including public keys.

This works no matter how many links you have in a chain. Joe Shmoe picks
a key, say X, and hikes over to Foo Corp., where his interviewer tells
him ``I'm Bob, key Y.'' Joe gets hired; Bob tells him to report to Big
Boss, key Z. Eventually Joe wants to switch companies. He applies to Bar
Corp., where Fred, key W, asks for recommendations. Joe-X asks Boss-Z to
send Fred-W a recommendation. Boss-Z fills out a recommendation talking
about Joe-X, and sends it to Fred-W using the W-Z keys. If Boss-Z wants,
he can check Fred-W's credentials, by asking Fred-W to provide a chain
of people who will vouch for him, through to someone that Boss-Z can
verify. Joe-X gets hired. Fred-W tells Bar-B, which keeps tabs on all
its employees, that Joe-X has been hired. Bar-B sends its key, B, to all
its shareholders in regular mailings. If one of those shareholders wants
to verify that Joe-X works for Bar-B through Fred-W, he can. And so on.

The *only* time when you have to trust a central authority to tell you
Joe's key is when that authority tells you Joe's name.

Changing public keys is no more of a problem than changing addresses. If
Boss-Z is honest then he can forward Joe-X's mail; otherwise he could
have read it any time he wanted anyway. In practice most people will
trust PostOffice-PO to manage keys for for delivering personal mail,
just as most people trust the Post Office not to open regular mail.

No. The same old techniques still work quite well: choose plaintexts,
learn plaintexts, guess plaintexts, look for duplicated messages sent
via multiple ciphers, guess keys, etc.

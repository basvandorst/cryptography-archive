Which version of MD4 are you talking about?  I have two, both of which
are from RSADSI.  The first version processes 1388k bytes/second on a Sparc-1
while the second (newer, more flexible) only operates at 665k bytes/second.
Obviously implementation is a major factor (a little more than 2 in this case).

As for MD5, it should only take 35-40% more time to digest messages.  It
invoves 1/3 more rounds (64 as opposed to 48) and each round is only slightly
more complex.

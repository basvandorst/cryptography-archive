Okay, now the guy is starting to get offensive. I'll run down his list,
answering the questions for what I can do on any UNIX box with free
software: des, compress or (say) yabba, uuencode.

Long encryption keys: not without modifications, though there are
emerging standards for long keys under UNIX. (snuffle 5.0 allows more
bytes in your key than you'll ever want to type.) Any conceivable
character in keys: Yes.

Yes, yes, and yes.

This option is implicit in how the software is invoked.

If you want, sure. Note that most compression methods introduce extra
redundancy into their output---more predictable redundancy, in fact,
than that of English text. yabba -r takes some precautions to make sure
that each bit of output is reasonably evenly distributed. Does your
compression software do this?

Yes.

Sure, with dd.

Yep, there are any number of disk-wipe programs around.

Sure. ``script''.

Nope. Are you saying that Dolphin's encryption software makes this
provision? If so, then I won't even bother inspecting your software
before I pronounce it a complete waste of money.

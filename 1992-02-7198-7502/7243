I agree.  I do want the knowledge that no one but me has the private
component of my key.

Potentially the scenario with the gateway you mentioned before could occur
between someone getting a new key and the KDC.  However the problem works
both ways so in this respect it is no more secure one way over the other.

How would KDC transmit to me, the private component of a key they generate
for me in the first place?  What truly secure and trustable medium do we
have for such a thing?

If they do generate a key for me, I won't use it.

Central Points' encryption software for the Macintosh has an interesting
option.  When you first install the program, you can install a "master"
key into the program.

When you encrypt a file or folder, you can either select "expert" mode,
in which case you get straight DES encryption after being prompted for
a key.

If you opt to not use "expert" mode, your file is still encrypted with
DES, but when you decrypt the file, you can supply either the correct
key or the "master" key.  Both will work.

I suspect that what they are doing is encrypting your second key with the
master and storing that with the encrypted file.

Note that this does not provide a back door for Central Point to use
to break files.  If you forget both the file key and the master key,
you are screwed.

I think that if I were concerned about forgetting keys, I would generate
one key via a good random number generator, and memorize it as if my life
depended on it.  I would then keep a file of keys that I have used for
ordinary purposes.  That file would be encrypted with the first key.
That key would *only* be used for encrypting that one file.  This *seems*
to be a safer way to have a back door for one's self.  Is it?

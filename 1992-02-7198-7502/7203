Sure. Ever hear of "safe deposit boxes"? If you're worried about
losing your crypto key, then keep a backup copy in a physically secure
place with limited, controlled access. If you're really worried, keep
several backups in several different banks.  There's no need to build
trapdoors into your cryptosystems.

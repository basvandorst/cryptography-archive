                   LECTURE SERIES ON HIGH INTEGRITY SYSTEMS

                   The Industrialization of Formal Methods

                              Dr. Susan Gerhart

                                April 3, 1992

                             NIST Green Auditorium

Formal Methods refers to the collection of techniques where the base
representations involve mathematics and logic formulations suitable for
expressing computer and information systems models.  Dr. Gerhart will
outline some of the basic representations as well as how they are
intended to be used.  She will identify how these techniques are
actually being used in industrial applications, and how safety-critical
systems standards are being formulated to utilize the advances in both
techniques and the underlying automated reasoning technology.  The
audience is invited to speculate on how the software engineering
profession must respond to the existence of an "applied mathematics for
software engineering."

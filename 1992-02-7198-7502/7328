You can't use a cryptographic technique without some mechanism for both
ends to learn the key.  You need either public-key encryption (which is
currently hampered by patents) or a secure key distribution mechanism such
as Kerberos.  If you don't use a secure mechanism for learning the
decryption key, then the eavesdroppers will be able to decrypt the
passwords as easily as the receiving systems.

So, the answer is for someone to implement Kerberos for DOS and Macs, and
for the maintainers of NCSA Telnet, PC/IP, etc. to incorporate it into
these products.  FTP also needs these enhancements (it also transmits
passwords in the clear), so the developer of XferIt (a Mac FTP client) and
other similar applications will also need to be enhanced.

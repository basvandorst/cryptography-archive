There's hope in this method.  It's like having only 16K different car
keys.  Instead of making one CD, make 16K different models of the CD
and many copies of each one.  The chance that some friend of yours
will have a CD with the same encryption key as yours is fairly low --
not 0 but maybe low enough to discourage me from trying to sell my key
at a reduced price.

However, as originally described, all the different copies were on the
same CD.  That means that each other person could decrypt the core
copy (in this scheme) with your key.



Face it guys, the problem as originally stated is not possible to
solve.  If the disks and the hardware are identical, then there's no
way to have my key not work on your copy.

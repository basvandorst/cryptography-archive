If he's put a good enough box around me, then he can spoof the whole
rest of the world w.r.t. me, but that's just a renaming of the
original problem.

If he manages to catch all messages between me and Dan, he has to
spoof each of us to the other in order to catch all references to the
key which might be contained within an encrypted message.

However, if we make a habit of sending veracity checks (a kind of
ping?)  out in encrypted mail to others we know, we can force him to
put a complete box around at least one of us.

Of course, those paranoid of NSA interference probably assume that
each of us is inside a complete box (or can be put in one).  The
trouble there is that if I'm in a complete box, there's no way to
distribute keys public or private.

Thank God for the Bill of Rights -- and the fact that the NSA and CIA
are prohibited from acting against US citizens.

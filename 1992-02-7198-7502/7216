As far as I know naga has no connection with D&D.  I suggest it is
a somewhat less boring net name than "heathh", which has a certain
bureaucratic rigidity to it, typical of your thinking.
 
ome Observations Concerning the Non-Randomness of DES-Encrypted Files

Nothing wrong with a good title.

But according to you no-one would wish to anyway, so no problem.

You don't respect copyright?  Posting on usenet can be, I think, said to a
form of publishing of written material, and copyright laws would presumably
apply, unless there's something special about the InterNet backbone, as you
imply.	If all posting of an article to Usenet amounts to transferring
copyright to the owner of the Internet backbone then there should be a
notice of this.  Next you'll be suggesting that ATT owns the information
transmitted on its cables.

Heath goes out of his way to be insulting.  Any idiot can throw insults.

Perhaps you didn't like the style of the article, but if so you probably
don't know how to write.  "Bludgeon"?  The words evidently contradict your
assertion.

I concede your point.  I should have thought more about this before posting.
However, it was posted in order to receive public evaluation, and people
were kind enough to point out its deficiencies.

Your readiness to cast aspersion without reference to the facts is showing.
If you'd looked at what I was referring to you'd see that:
 
    File MC1.GEN contains 52882 bytes and 89 different byte values.
and
    File MC1.SEC contains 52956 bytes and 256 different byte values.
 
So the difference in file size before and after encryption of MC1 with
PCSECURE is 74 bytes, considerably more than then 0 to 7 extra bytes which
would result from padding to 8 bytes.

When Word Perfect writes a generic textfile spaces are not added.  It turns
out that this particular file had a large number of spaces due to the
presence of several tables, and so it was not, as I had claimed, "fairly
typical" of English text.  An error.  However, I had noticed a similar
phenomenon in many cases of English text.

You are incorrect in your attribution of motive.  This posting was not meant
to promote our encryption software, although I can see how mistaken attri-
bution of that motive could result.  In fact the postings on DES were put
there precisely to be criticised by cryptologists.	No progress without
publication and criticism, no?

This is your interpretation, and an intolerant and ungracious one.  However,
to avoid the appearance of impropriety I shall cease to use this signature.

I did not notice any regulations posted on entry to Usenet, except an
admonition basically to behave in a civil manner on the net.  I believe I
have acted civilly, which is more than can be said for you.  Does the
agreement prohibit free expression of ideas too?
 
I agree, however, that participants should not solicit business via the
Internet.  My postings were not a business solicitation, but observations
presented for criticism which mentioned an address for other information.
It seems to me you are overly sensitive on this point, for reasons I don't
care to speculate on.  However, I'll try to avoid causing you and others
further conniptions regarding this matter.

I welcome feedback.  The canons of proper behavior should spring from
consensus, as in any group not controlled from above.  I wouldn't wish to
offend contributors to this newsgroup, or even most of the others reading.
However, I don't believe a "summary" of any email Heath might receive on
this matter would be presented in an unbiased manner, considering your
obvious intent is to pour scorn upon me.
 
I apologise to the net for having to deal with this attack, but since it
was publicly posted I cannot allow it to pass without comment.	I do not
intent to continue debate along these lines.

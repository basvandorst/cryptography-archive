  I know this is probably a distinctly nontrival question, but
I was wondering if anyone might have some insight.

  Let's say I have a large number Unix accounts, each with the same
password.  I notice by looking in /etc/passwd that n different
salts resulted in n different encrypted entries for my one 
password.  Is the search space for the password constrained 
(to a space significantly less than 2^56) by the n encrypted entries.
In other words, if I have 4096 unix accounts with
the same password and it just so happens /etc/password has 4096
different encryptions of the password with 4096 different salts,
how worried should I be that a 'bad guy' can easily determine my
password.  Does a large n sufficiently constrain the search space
to some small set...perhaps of size 1?  Is there a (widely) known 
test that can be applied to a set of entries from /etc/passwd to 
determine if a user has different passwords for each account?

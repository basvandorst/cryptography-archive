SITUATION:  I would like to combine my database with databases provided by
several other companies on one master cdrom for distribution to customers.
This really cuts our production costs (for mastering the cdrom) to a price
we (and our customers) can all afford.  What I need from the network is a
technique for enciphering the data for each database with a different key
so that my clients can only read my database -- and clients from the other
companies can only read their database.  Ideally, the cryptographic method
should be secure against penetration without access to extremely expensive
supercomputer time -- access to the key for one database should not reduce
the security of the other databases -- compromise of the crypto algorithm
should not reduce the security of any database -- in essence the cost of
penetrating the algorithm should be quite high -- say about $10K to $20K.

Also, it would be nice if the cryptographic technique permitted the use of
a secondary key (client name) to generate a challenge sequence which must
be answered with a unique key (to be provided by the vendor to each client)
so that one client's key would not unlock the database for another client.

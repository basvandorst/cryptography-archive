If you intercept *everything* at Carl's end, and forge Carl's key to the
public, then you can certainly do this. Otherwise I don't see how such a
situation can possibly arise. Do you realize how much work has to go
into forging someone's key? You have to intercept every message in which
he mentions his key, and retransmit it with your own key. That
introduces its own problems: you may be able to intercept a broadcast
message (from Carl to the world) easily enough, but you can't even read
an encrypted message (from Carl to Dan) unless you know Dan's private
key. So you have to intercept *every* message to Carl containing a
public key which Carl might ever send a message to later, forge all the
public keys in those messages, and be prepared to undo the damage later
on every message Carl sends out.

If you control some, but not all, of Carl's neighbors, you can certainly
try forging some messages and then hoping that your luck lasts---long
enough for you to escape the country, anyway. You can also go out on the
street and grab one purse after another until you hit a little old lady
with a gun. I'm not sure which activity has a higher probability of
success.

That is not the real question.  The real question is about impersonation.
If Joe Bftsplk posts a public key as Dan Bernstein, there is a danger that
information intended for Dan Bernstein will be understood by Joe Bftsplk.
It might be a difficult job for the real Dan Bernstein to convince the
sender that he is the person who should have received the message encoded
by Dan Bernstein's public key and not Joe Bftsplk's masquerade.

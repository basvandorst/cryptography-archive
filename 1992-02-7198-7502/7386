As an improvement on Dan's triples, instead of having (name,address,key)
triples, you need only use (address,key) as the person's "real name".

What that person says, within signed and encrypted messages (using the key
given) might include sentences like:

	a.	my birth certificate calls me "Dan Bernstein"
or
	b.	after tomorrow, you can also reach me at (address,key-prime)
		or (address-prime,key) or ....
or
	c.	after Wednesday, I won't take mail using (address,key) any
		more.

The point is that you met this person via the net, so name on birth
certificate or hair color or whatever are completely irrelevant.  Any
string which identifies the person is good.  A given name, like Carl
Ellison, isn't -- because it doesn't identify the person uniquely.

All I've pointed out is that in Dan's triple (name,address,key), the
name field is redundant and can be left off.

What weakness do they demonstrate in the 2-round (that is, 2 hash)
version that forces them to use the 4-round version for their proofs
of security?

Hint: consider the single-block messages

    A,B

and then

    A,C

If the opponent knows the plain and cleartext of the first message,
and knows half the plaintext of the second message, he can trivially
compute the full plaintext of the second message.

If you consider only chosen-plaintext attacks and aren't worried about
chosen-ciphertext attacks, the paper shows that 3 rounds is
sufficient.

Neal

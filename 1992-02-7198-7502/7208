Not necessarily.  If you encrypt your message (or at least your
signature) with both the other party's public key AND your private key
then the person in the middle won't be able to spoof unless he has
intercepted both party's broadcasts or cracked both of their private
keys.  

If you include in this doubly encrypted area the public key of the
party you are sending to, then the spoofer will be unable to intercept
and forward messages unless he has broken both private keys.  Even if
he has seccessfully intercepted both broadcasts, he would only be able
to intercept the first communication.  But he would be unable to
forward it to the other party as he would be unable to re-encrypt the
body with the correct public key in place.

Or have I missed something?

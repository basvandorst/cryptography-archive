I had a bit more of a response than I'd expected, and have therefore
put the RFC's up for anonymous ftp on  csadfa.cs.adfa.oz.au, directory
/security/telnet. 

Just to make things crystal clear:

1) YES, we have implemented both a secure telnet and FTP. These are
documented (in RFC form) in the files mentioned above.

2) NO, the sources are currently not available, as they contain
significant chunks of proprietary code copyrighted by CCSR.

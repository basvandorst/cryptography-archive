Sorry about replying to my own message, but a good feature
could be to have the encyption program ask for the degree
of security required.

 The levels could range from modest for files of only temporary
importance to strict for very secure files. A file considered
for modest security could be decrypted withyout a key in
say 10 minutes or less. A file considered secure would have
the full security of a strong cryptographic system

I submit that if a population survey were done on encrypted
'files, the population would follow an exponential curve.
The vast majority would require only modest encryption
while only a very few would require the full strength
of DES.

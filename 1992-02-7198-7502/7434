We built a system about ten years ago which was protected from piracy by
temporary passwords. Every three months, the system would display a message
`error no. 269&vb3 - call XYZ Co. on 01-234-5678 for assistance'. The
telephonist would check the caller's name and number, and issue a code
which would reactivate the system for another three months.

Such a system is ideal except for the logistics. The hassle factor would
become serious if every PC software vendor used it. 

However, if you're going to distribute all PC software on one CDROM, it
becomes the obvious way to do things.

Embed code in each application which requires a new token each month, which
token can be checked against a public key embedded in the application.
Arrange for these tokens to be generated by a suitable privacy homomorphism
so that they are unique for each CD and a master token for each CD for each
month can be communicated, whether by modem or by phone, to the user.

This should make it a lot harder for a rogue user to pass copies of code to
third parties.

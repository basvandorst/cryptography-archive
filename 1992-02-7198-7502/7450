This is the sad truth.

An implementation could be to encrypt the code, 
of the software, forcing the user to type his key in
each time. But. All i takes is for a hacker is to
get hold of an original license, type in his key,
copy the program (and overlays?) from memory and
put together a new version, uncrypted.
Though this is very difficult, quite a challenge!
Maybe if the code came on non-erasable medium (CD?)
Assuming that this medium be used at all times.
This would force the hacker to recode the IO-routines
from scratch! Thus making it VERY difficult.
(So difficult, that it looses its interrest)

In a book I am reading it talk about the "cypher breakers
workshop" or something similar to that. 
I am interested in  finding out where I can ftp this, or if 
someone has the source to it(I understand it is in the public
domain) if they could mail it to me.

if there are any other neat programs lurking about that do 
cypher breaking, please feel free to send them to me as well :)


thanks,

Tom

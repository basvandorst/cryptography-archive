It seems to me that the problem resolves down a variation on the Byzantine
Agreement Problem, and in particular cannot be solved without
independent communication channels.  (as in:  A talks directly to C
instead of A talks to B who talks to C).  These channels need not be
secure in terms of eavesdropping, but must be tamper-proof.  Without
them, I propose that the public-key distribution problem is not
solvable.

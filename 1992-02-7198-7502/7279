CAVEAT: I'm NOT a cryptographer or cryptanalyst.  


It is my personal belief that MD5 is harder to compromise than MD4.

  I also understand that the "Secure SNMP" protocols about to be
published as RFCs by the Internet changed from using MD4 to using MD5
on grounds that the latter was stronger and that the former is more
vulnerable when more than a few transactions are going across the wire
for a wiretapper to collect.

  I was very interested with the recent SHS proposal that was posted
here and hope that anyone who does look into it seriously would post
their technical evaluation of it.

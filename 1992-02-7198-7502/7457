I received a message from someone a few days back regarding 
the frequency of letters and there was a reference to 
netlib@peregrine.com.  A FAQ exists there.  I tried sending for
an index using netlib@peregrine.com as the address and 
send index as both the message and subject.  I have not received 
anything back from this netlib.  Any ideas as to what is happening?

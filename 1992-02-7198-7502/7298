Well, Indeed. What I was pointing out, is: "IF you dont/cant choose a
system without masterkey, it is dangerous." But, of course, if I have
all the choice on Earth, Ping-Shun Huang is right, it is irresponsible
if I choose a security system not suitable for my applications. But, if
all the systems avaiblable contain a back door, or master-key, it is
also irresponsible.

You could provide an auth code which is tied to the user's credit card number
i.e. the user would have to use the credit card number with the auth code to
unlock the data.  This would *reduce* the likelihood that the user would give
the key to other users.  Of course, it doesn't prevent the user from unlocking
several of their own copies, nor from cancelling the credit card after paying
you. (Nor does it prevent them from giving you someone else's credit card
details. :-)

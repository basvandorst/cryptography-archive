You didn't demonstrate it this time either. Your ``revised scheme''
requires complete control over Carl's machine. Either you control all of
Carl's neighbors, in which case there's no possible way to stop you; or
you don't, and Carl's not going to be nice enough to send you all his
messages addressed to people whose names start with D, let alone vice
versa! There's no case in between. In practice the first case would be
tremendously difficult to achieve, not only because controlling
someone's communication is so difficult, but also because nearly all of
a typical person's communication will be from one key to another, not
broadcast.

I thought that's what I said before. Anyway, the real point here is that
a key distribution center is unnecessary. All you need is multiple
links; you don't need to trust any particular link.

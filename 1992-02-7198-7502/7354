If I know who the Dan Bernstein I am trying to communicate with, 
and the other person is not sufficiently similar, and I can see
him in the flesh, then you are right.  But if I am trying to 
cmmunicate something confidential to the particular Dan Bernstein
who I believe posted the message to which I am responding, and there
is some reason for someone to impersonate this person, then I need
some way of authenticating the identity.  Now suppose Joe Bftsplk
enters a public key procedure claiming to be Dan Bernstein.  How
am I to be able to tell that this is a fraudulent public key, put
in for the purpose of receiving confidential information not intended
to Joe Bftsplk?

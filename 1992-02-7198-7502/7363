In the last 2 days I have found the following ways to potentially
circumvent my spoofed newsfeed.  If my AT&TNet and SnailMailNet
connections are also insecure then I'm just screwed.  If however I
send these people mail to confirm, then things are happy.  I have a
secure channel to SOMEONE who can verify my identity to the net.  The
technique to distribute keys safely is to scream loud on every
possible communication channel you can.  If you are recieving mail
that says one key and netpostings another, then there's cause to
worry.  If the mail, the phone call, the add in the paper, the
netmail, the direct email, all match then that's cool.

Anyone who wants me to post a public key for them can write to me at:

Any other volunteers?  We can't all be in cahoots, can we?

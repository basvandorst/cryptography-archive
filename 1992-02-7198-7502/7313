For many of us who have never met Dan Bernstein and are never likely to
but who converse with him over the net, all that matters is that the
person who first introduced himself that way continues to be the one
with whom we converse.

In this case, I do not issue my own equivalent of security clearances
(decisions to trust someone with my private thoughts) based on physical
appearance or the name on a driver's license.  I issue them based on
what I learn about the person in the course of e-mail conversations.


The same could apply with financial transactions (probably the most
severe of non-government security problems).  If I am a bank, all I care
about is that the person making an electronic withdrawal from this
account is the same person as the one who made the electronic deposits.
I don't care what name that person has or how he or she looks.

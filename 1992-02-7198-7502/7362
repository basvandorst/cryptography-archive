In article <hebrais.07vh@mirkwood.CAM.ORG> hebrais@mirkwood.CAM.ORG (Philippe Hebrais) 

   Hi!

   I committed myself to give a short lecture on cryptography to a
   highschool class.  However, I am short of information on the
   history of cryptography.

   If you have any information on the early contributors to cryptography
   or interesting anecdotes, feel free to post them.

   In particular, I'd like the following information:

   1) What is the earliest reference to cryptography?
      I seem to remember it is attributed to an antic arabic mathematician.
      But I can't remember his name or the century he lived in.

   2) What is written on Sheakespeare's tombstone?

   3) What dates are associated with Blaise de Vigenere?

   4) What is the first name of Mr. Vernam?

   5) What is the name of the inventor of the Enigma (German crypto-machine
      used in World War II).

   But, please don't refrain for volonteering information because I didn't
   ask for it explicitely!

I think a point that is being missed in this "master key" discussion is
that the crypto systems in question (DES for sure, probably DOLPHIN dumbware)
are private key systems and that the physical lock analogy applies only to
PUBLIC key systems.  

What I mean is that a lot of the properties of locks are not available in 
private key systems.  One is: the ability to close a physical lock does not 
imply the ability to open it.  For instance- suppose our software appends a 
master key encrypted version of the user's password to any file it encrypts.  
The danger is not that somebody who knows the master key can decrypt the file.
The danger is that anybody who has access to the configured software can poke
around and get the MASTER key (in private key cryptography it has to be in
there somewhere).

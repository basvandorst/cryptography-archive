There is no single correct frequency of letters in English.  The counts
vary depending on type of text -- even on author -- and a single author's
counts will probably vary with time and subject matter.

What you need to do is grab text of the kind you're interested in and
count characters, digraphs, trigraphs, etc., yourself.

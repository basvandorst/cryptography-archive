I am looking for detailed information for creating digital signtures
for authenticy verification. Especialy for FTPable C sources.
I already have all the RSA info I wanted but can't really use it
because of patent problems.
Can anyone help me to find detailed info on MAA or DSA which seem
boot usefull for what I want ?

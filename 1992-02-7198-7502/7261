   Actually this subject line is unfair, why is DE's software
   any more vulnerable to these attacks than someone else's?

it isn't any necessarily any more vulnerable than other msdos based
software.

it _is_ necessarily more vulnerable than unix based software merely by
the fact that it is running under msdos.

but the fact that the software's author didn't seem to realize that
such lateral attacks are practical indicates to me that the author
probably didn't deal with them either.

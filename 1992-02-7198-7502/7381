I just finished studying the DSA digital signature algorithm and
the MAA message authentication algorithm (thanks to all those who
responded to my questions!!). Since the MD5 algorithm seems much
more advanced then MAA, from which it is derived I don't believe
MAA is interesting.

DSA however seems very interesting to me. It works, is resonable
fast (slower than RSA but not much slower) and has not been pattented
nor has pattent been aplied for it. Since this means it is public
knowledge now I assume it will never be patented too (right?).

One thing however I didn't find out however was how secure DSA is.
The docs I have describe how to do it but not why it is secure. Or
what the development considerations where. Can anyone tell me more
about that?

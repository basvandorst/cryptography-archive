[description of hassles a changed system configuration caused]

And of course the really silly part is how easy these schemes are to
defeat when you want to pirate the software. You just install the
software into the other (unlicensed) systems using the original
distribution diskette, instead of copying off the files on your hard
disk.  If the installation process modifies the distribution diskette,
just add another layer of redirection -- copy the original disk and
install from the copy.

I routinely install from a copy of an installation disk whenever it
appears that the installation process modifies it, even if it's just
to add a user name. I absolutely refuse to insert a distribution disk
of ANYTHING into my system without a write-protect tab.

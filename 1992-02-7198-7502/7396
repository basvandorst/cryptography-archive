At the recent Asiacrypt meeting last November, a paper on the number
of pairs needed for differential analysis was given (I do not have the
name of the author). I would be grateful if someone who attended the 
meeting could mail me or post the abstract, or give a short summary of
the results presented in the paper.

Thank you

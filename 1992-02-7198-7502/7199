 Well, gee.  Perhaps the rest of my response was unclear.  Here it is:

 There are often several forms of "key" in a real cipher, including
 a "user key," a "message key," and a "keying sequence."  In one
 common design, a "user key" is used only to encipher a "message key"
 value; then the "message key" is used to initialize an RNG which
 generates a "keying sequence" which is somehow reversibly combined
 with the data.

 The repeated use of a single user key, when used to encipher non-
 random data, certainly is a cryptographic weakness.  However, the
 repeated use of a single user key, when used only to encipher
 "messages" which consist only of random data, "leaks" no information
 at all to the cryptanalyst (unless the cipher is bogus).

 In practice, these random "messages" are the "message key" values,
 which naturally differ for each and every message.  The message
 key values are used to encipher the data, and this means that a
 different key is used to encipher the non-random data in each and
 every message.  And if the message key values are unconstrained,
 they can be transported by even a simple cipher without risk.


 Once more with feeling:

    In a secret-key cipher, a single user key may be used repeatedly,
 indefinitely, without the cryptoanalytic weakness normally associated
 with key re-use, when the cipher design properly uses a "really
 random" message key.

    Of course, in both secret-key and public-key ciphers there is
 always a secret key which must be protected.  Because of normal
 employee turnover, limited physical security, and a reasonable desire
 to limit the amount of data protected by one key, keys *must* be
 changed periodically.  Both secret-key and public-key systems
 must change user keys periodically.  Message keys do not affect
 this, but instead address the issue of non-random data being
 enciphered under the same key.

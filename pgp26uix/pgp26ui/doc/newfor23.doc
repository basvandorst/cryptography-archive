News for PGP 2.3a

There was a bug in PGP's handling of clear-signed messages when lines
were terminated with CR-LF pairs.  This has been revamped.  The previous
limit on the length of lines in clear-signed messages has been eliminated.

The randseed.bin file was not closed when read, which resulted in it
not being rewritten with a new value under some operating systems.
Fixed.

Not all of the bytes in randseed.bin were being used, resulting in less
randomness than desired when picking session keys.  While it did not make
the compromise of session keys likely, it was undesirable and has been fixed.

PGP should now compile with less difficulty under OS/2.
The Turbo C makefile was incorrect.  Fixed.
The VMS build files were out of date.  Fixed.

PGP was not accepting octal escapes in the language.txt file that did not
begin with \0.  \377 is now acceptable.
The language.txt file got mangled in the middle somehow.  Fixed.

News for PGP 2.3

This PGP 2.3 release has several bug fixes over PGP 2.2, and a few
new (although somewhat esoteric) features.  Among them are:

- An important bug: there was a bug with compression under MS-DOS which
  caused the wrong piece of memory to be freed, with results that ranged
  from none to undecodable messages to machine crashes.

- When adding keys, PGP now properly closes all the files it opens, so
  you don't run out of file handles (MS-DOS) or file descriptors (UNIX).

- Sometimes PGP would not properly ask the user to set trust parameters
  when keys were validated by adding new signatures.  This has been
  fixed.

- When PGP messages are sent through a MIME mail system, a conflict
  arises over the use of the '=' character.  PGP can now decode ASCII
  armored messages which have been mangled by MIME's quoting mechanism.

- PGP previously kept track of one pass phrase (from the PGPPASS
  environment variable, the file descriptor named by the PGPPASSFD
  environment variable, a -z <password> option, or previous user
  prompts), and tried it if it needed a subsequent pass phrase.  This
  caused bugs if you attempted something that required two pass phrases,
  such as pgp -sc (sign and conventionally encrypt).  PGP now keeps
  track of any number of pass phrases, including multiple -z options,
  and uses them as necessary.  Mostly, it just Does The Right Thing,
  but if you care, the exact algorithm is as follows:

  - There is a pool of private-key pass phrases that starts out with the
    contents of the PGPPASS environment variable (if any), and has every
    pass phrase that is successfully used to unlock a private key added
    to it.  When a private key needs unlocking, every pass phrase in the
    pool is tried first.
  - There is a list of PGP pass phrases available for use by whatever needs
    one.  This is initialized with the -z command-line options and the
    phrase read from the PGPPASSFD file descriptor.  When a pass phrase
    is needed, it is taken from the front of that list.  When a pass
    phrase is needed to unlock a secret key, every key on the list is tried,
    and if it "fits" and unlocks the secret key, it is moved to the key
    pass phrase pool.
  - If the above fails to produce a pass phrase, the user is prompted to
    supply one.

  Key generation (we need all the keystrokes we can get for random-number
  accumulation) and key signing (to make sure the user really means to do
  what they're doing) are exceptions; the user is always prompted for a
  pass phrase under those circumstances.

New options:

+pkcs_compat=n
	This defaults to 1, which tells PGP to generate encryption key
	and signature blocks in a format derived from the PKCS standards.
	This format is understood (but not generated) by PGP 2.2.  If set
	to 0, the old format is generated, which may be needed for
	portability to PGP versions before 2.2.  PGP is still incompatible
	with the PKCS standards in many ways, but in future, values of 2
	or higher may be used to produce formats which are more compatible.

Other notes:

The MS-DOS executable was compiled with Borland C++ version 3.0, optimized
for maximum speed, except that jump optimisation was turned off.  If it
is turned on, the Transform() function in md5.c is compiled incorrectly.
The pgp.prj file that was used is included in the source distribution.

Thanks to everyone who worked on PGP and sent in bug reports.  Two who
didn't make it into the manual are to Lindsay DuBois for a bit of last-
minute translation, and Reptilian Research for support in developing PGP.

And thanks to the Cypherpunks who managed to get PGP so much attention
in Wired magazine recently.

I hope you enjoy PGP!

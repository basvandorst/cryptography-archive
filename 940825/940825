Jeff,
I have merged your files in with my distribution tree
and put the result on ripem.msu.edu as
/pub/crypt/ripem/experimental/ripem-2.0b1.zip
(This .zip file uses Unix end-of-lien conventions.)

The changes sound good!

[good stuff deleted.]

Alas, under SunOS 4.1.3_U1, ripem compiles OK but when running "make test"
it core dumps with a memory fault in ProcessHeader.
The problem is with a call to fprintf at line 2082 of ripemmai.c.

I'll give it a shot on some other platforms.

Subject: Exporting portions of RIPEM

I have gotten varying advice from "experts" regarding export
of RIPEM minus RSAREF.  It seems risky to export all of RIPEM,
just omitting RSAREF.  However, I think it'd be safe enough to
export all the header-parsing and whatnot, leaving out any
chunks of code that even call RSAREF.

Hello,

I am one of the main developers of RIPEM, a public domain crypto
application which will soon be PEM compliant.

I urge you to heed Steve Crocker's advice and aim towards the MIME/PEM
standard (now in draft) instead of RFC 1421-1424 which have many
shortcomings which are addressed by the MIME/PEM spec.  This is the
direction that RIPEM is heading.

I am not sure how export of RIPEM to Australia works, especially for
the non-crypto code such as parsing, etc. that you asked about.
(Maybe Mark can help here?)  Also note: RIPEM is based on RSAREF, the
crypto tookit from RSA, which also has export restrictions.

Hello pem-dev,

We are currently investigating the possibility of developing a PEM system 
that complies with RFC1421-24 for the Prentice Centre, University of 
Queensland.

This software will be made publicly available at no charge, once it is
completed.  As it is to become available in this way, we are trying to 
minimise the costs and time involved by obtaining any relevant public 
domain code.

Do you know of any available source code, of any relevance to this project 
-- e.g. encryption code, header parsers, canonical conversion -- we don't 
want to reinvent the wheel.  We would also like to contact other people
currently implementing a PEM system who may be able to help us.

We will acknowledge any contributions you can make to our effort.  Also, if
you would like any other information about this project, please feel free 
to contact us.

Also we would like to join the pem-dev mailing list, preferably as
R.Stuart@cc.uq.oz.au and R.Cockburn@cc.uq.oz.au separately.
Thanks for your time,


R. Cockburn & R. Stuart
PEM Investigation Team

I do not see any problems exporting code without RSAREF as far as the US
is concerned.  Of course, you also have to look into whether the receiving
country permits the import.

This code seems to work on a big-endian machine, but I'm not sure. This
version has most of the set-precision's taken out, since mpilib does that
automatically for the modexp's.

Those functions which do change precision - the e/d list create and the
unblinding - have two possible settings. If you define HIGHFIRST, it enables
a macro which hopefully will correct the pointers appropriately. If this
does not work, also define HIGH_KLUDGE and it will force all precision to
MAX_UNIT_PRECISION. This is slow but should work. Please let me know on
Cypherpunks or alt.security.pgp if it works or not.

The program also needs a better makefile.

This version fixes a bug in fifo_moven which would hang up if n was larger
than the number of bytes left in the fifo. The mp_inv in pgpkgen.c is much
faster than the old one, and was provided by an anonymous contributor.

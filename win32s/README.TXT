This program is Win32s version 1.1.5a.  It allows you to run 32-bit 
Windows applications, which do not use Windows NT-specific features,
under Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups.  Mosaic v2.0alpha4 is
a 32-bit application and requires the win32s software.  If you already 
use other 32-bit Windows applications then you already have this 
software installed in your /windows/system/win32s directory.  Since
Microsoft recently released this version we recommend you uggrade
to this latest version of the Win32s software.

Unzip the file w32s115a.zip onto two floppies or into an empty directory.  
Use -d extension so the unzip utility will put the files in their proper
directories.  For example:

		pkunzip -d w32s115

From the program manager select File, Run... and type in the path of the
setup program.  For example:

		c:\temp\disk1\setup

After Win32s has installed itself you will given an option to install a 
32-bit card game called Freecell.  Freecell is a really cool solitare game
and running it is a good way to test your computer.

Win32s was developed by Microsoft and it is freely distributed to licensed
users of Windows 3.1 or Windows for Workgroups.

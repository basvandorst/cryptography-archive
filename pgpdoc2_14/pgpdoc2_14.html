<H2>Checking if everything is OK on your public key ring</H2>
<P>Normally, PGP automatically checks any new keys or signatures on your
public key ring and updates all the trust parameters and validity
scores.  In theory, it keeps all the key validity status information
up to date as material is added to or deleted from your public key
ring.  But perhaps you may want to explicitly force PGP to perform a
comprehensive analysis of your public key ring, checking all the
certifying signatures, checking the trust parameters, updating all
the validity scores, and checking your own ultimately-trusted key
against a backup copy on a write-protected floppy disk.  It may be a
good idea to do this hygienic maintenance periodically to make sure
nothing is wrong with your public key ring.  To force PGP to perform
a full analysis of your public key ring, use the <KBD>-kc</KBD> (key ring check)
command:
<PRE>
     pgp -kc
</PRE>
You can also make PGP check all the signatures for just a single
selected public key by:
<PRE>
     pgp -kc userid [keyring]
</PRE>
For further information on how the backup copy of your own key is
checked, see the description of the BAKRING parameter in the
<A HREF="setting-conf-par.html">configuration file section</A> of this
manual.

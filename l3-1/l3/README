L3 is an simple public key package which implements digital signatures
and public key encryption using a hybrid LUC/IDEA+DES approach. RSA
is also supported, really just so I could do some timing tests comparing
LUC and RSA.

This is for experimental and research purposes only. Some of the
algorithms included here are covered by various patents. (e.g.
LUC, RSA, IDEA). I wrote this so I could learn a few things about
public key cryptography, and am distributing it in the hope that
others may both:
1. critique my code and tell me what mistakes I've made 
2. learn from my code

I'd really be grateful to anyone who points out any blatant stupidities
in my implementation.

Also, please do not export any component of this software outside
of the U.S. and Canada without obtaining the appropriate export
licence.

This package can be compiled to be linked with either GNU gmp 1.3.2
or FGMP 1.0. You will get much better performance, if you use GNU gmp,
but FGMP is in the public domain, so you can use it without worrying
about the GPL.

GNU GMP is available from the GNU archive sites.
FGMP is available from the comp.sources.misc archive sites.

For more details see L3.DOC

mg is a conventional key encryption program which uses a composition
of DES, tran and IDEA. The interface is very similar to that of Unix compress.
The files it produces have the extension .U

I've only tested L3 on (and ported L3 to) a few Unix systems: Linux,
AIX 3.2, Sun OS 4.1.

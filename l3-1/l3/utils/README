Included are two simple scripts for signing plaintext messages
and verifying signatures.

tsign (calls sign) to sign message on stdin
stdout is signed message (printable)

tvsign (calls vsign) to verify signature on signed message
message to stdout if signature is OK

tsign takes one parameter (private key file name)


e.g.

genkey me 1024
tsign me <document >signed_document
tvsign <signed_document

These are necessarily ideal, but are examples of how one might choose 
to implement signed plaintext documents for email.


similarly
tdecrypt   (no params)
tencrypt   (pubfile)


I leave it as an exercise to write scripts for signed encrypted plaintext
messages.

You'll probably want to change the definition of bindir in these.

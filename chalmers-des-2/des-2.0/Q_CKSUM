The function `quad_cksum' is not a part of this DES package, but may be
installed with a minimum of effort. Do as follows:


	1. Fetch the file "quad_cksum.c" from the same place as you got
	   the DES package.

	2. Insert the file "quad_cksum.c" in the directory "lib/".

	3. Remove the comments surrounding the macro definition
	   "#define HAS_QUAD_CKSUM" in the file "include/des.h"

	4. Remove the comments before the macro definitions
	   "#OLD_SRCS = quad_cksum.c" and "#OLD_OBJS = quad_cksum.o"
	   in the file "lib/Makefile".


Parts of the `quad_cksum' function comes from an implementation made by
Eric Young <eay@surf.sics.bu.oz.au>, see the copyright notice included
in the file.

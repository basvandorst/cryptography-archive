2.0	Patch level 0.

	Cleaned up manual pages.

	A `dea_conf.h' is automaticly generated for the variant of DEA
	with best performance (is `sort' truly portable ?).

	Changed generation of header files to a more atomic method:
	a file `tmp.h' is first generated and then moved to the real name.

	Most of the DAA code for `des_dea' and `des_dea3' moved to des_dea.h

	Sourounded `include/des.h' and `include/encrypt.h' with
	`_DES_H_' and `_ENCRYPT_H_'.

	Added the `des_dea3' trippel DES encryption/decryption function.


1.4	Patch level 4.
	
	Added a `MAX_DES_PASSWD' define the, if defined, forces the package
	to uses a fixed size buffer to read password from a tty.

	Modified the password handling routines use a buffer supplied
	by a user.

	Made a new function `des_read_pw_string'. The function must be
	present because of compability reasons.

	Made a new function, `des_init_random_number_generator' that
	sets the internal seed value used by `des_random_cblock'.

	To follow the MIT function definitions, the following functions
	has been renamed:
	`des_set_key'		-> `des_key_sched'
	`des_set_key_parity'	-> `des_fixup_key_parity'
	`des_test_key_parity'	-> `des_check_key_parity'

	Chnaged the following functions name:
	`des_key'		-> `des_sched''

	The flags 'C', 'E', 'F', 'O' and 'P' in `descrypt' has been
	replaced with the flag "-m mode" where `mode' can take any of the
	values: CBC, ECB, CFB8, OFB8 or PCBC.

	A new f|ag 'b' for `descrypt' and `deskey' that selects the
	non MIT `des_string_to_key' algorithm.

	Moved all test and verification stuff to `./verify'.

	Inserted the correct MIT `des_string_to_key' algorithm (at least
	I think this is the right one).

	Inserted support for multiple `des_string_to_key' algorithms by
	adding the `des_set_string_mode' function.


1.3	Patch level 3.

	Removed padding bug preset only on IBM RT/PC AOS 4.3 with the
	`hc' compiler.

	THE `DESCRYPT' PROGRAM DECRYPTED WHEN INSTRUCTED TO ENCRYPT AND
	VICE VERSA. A bug introduced from 1.2.

	A new flag "-f keyfile" for `descrypt' and `deskey' that enables
	the program to read the key from a file.

	Inserted the `encrypt' and `setkey' functions, as described in
	X/Open Portability Guide (December 1988), in libdes.a.


1.2	Patch level 2.

	Inserted getopt(3) for all argument flag handling.

	Changed CONST to const.

	Moved lib/sigaction.c to config/fake_sigaction.c

	Created config/fake_times.c to replace the `times' function if
	the original times don't return any time information.

	Removed all BSD code from lib/des_rblock.c.


1.1	Patch level 1.

	Portability problems with the install program.
	Fix from: hk@simulina.se (H}kan K{llberg).
	des/man/Makefile, des/prog/Makefile

	Changed the code to (mostly) follow X/Open.

	Works on machines with 16-bit integers (I think).
	Fix from: ? (I lost the original mail with the author,
	problem description and fix).

	Removed the "0x" part of the output from des_print.c

	Made `quad_cksum' a separate part of the release.

	Moved all configuration stuff to the directory config.

	Inserted dynamic configuration of system and complier.


1.0	Initial revision.

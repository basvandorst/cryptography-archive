Dear user,

I wanted PGS to read the position of the public and secret keyring files
from the config.txt this is still nog yet implemented.

Because I have very little time to spend on PGS on the moment. I released
the new public beta from PGS now. So you can enjoy it already ;-)

Greeting,

Eelco Cramer.

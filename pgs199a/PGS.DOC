    Pretty Good PGP Shell is a user-friendly sophisticated professional
    shell to make working with Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) a bit easier.


    Disclaimer:
      Although this software has been tested frequently between updates
      and prior to release, we can _not_ guarantee it is 100% error or
      bug free. We, Eric Limpens and Eelco Cramer, will not be held
      responsible to any damage to you or your software/hardware in any
      case, although this might be due to PGS.

      However, we would appreciate any information about the cause of such,
      even though we don't think it will occur.

Usage:

 The Pretty Good PGP Shell usages a hierarchical menu set, which is
 organised so that PGP commands can be used easily.

 When using PGS in the command-line mode, you will only see the menus
 which are essential to the procedure which you want to use.
 For information about PGS, please use the online help facility, which can
 be used pressing F1, F2 or F3. We could write a 300 page manual on PGS, but
 as this shell is quite self explanatory, and its use is intended for the
 more professional user, we don't...



Credits:

       Credit where credit is due, these people have encouraged us in
       creating this shell, supporting us with information which was
       essential to some of the functions it includes, and for fool-proof
       testing and figuring out how many bugs it still contained......

       (in random order)

       Alex de Joode     - For the PGS mailing list.

       Branko Lancaster  - Who supplied us a copy of his key-ring
                           dump procedure, which was the base of the
                           several procedures which read the information
                           from the public and secret keys.

       Ralph Brown       - For creating a great (gigantic) database of the
                           DOS and BIOS services. Check out the INTERxxx.ZIP
                           files on the SIMTEL-20 sites.

                           This product uses the spawno routines by Ralf Brown
                           to minimize memory use while shelling to dos and
                           running other programs.


       The NHL           - Who supplied us with enough equipment (although
                           a bit slow on the fileservers now and than) and
                           with the Borland C 3.1 environment.

                           -- This does NOT mean they get a registration
                                  discount or whatever favour --

       ... and you, for using our software...

    CRYPARIT.ENC is the program listed in CS #4, p13 adapted for the IBM. As
noted in the CS, it is only a guide program. It will do Additions, Subtractions
and Multiplications, with some limitations. The Division routine is
bypassed temporarily, as it needs work to complete it. The program is
basically an exercise in screen formatting, at which the IBM is notoriously
bad. You can spend a lot of time cosmetically improving this program! It
does have default examples built in, so just press ENTER in answer to the
prompts. NB word inputs must be in Upper case, and the longest one should go
in first.

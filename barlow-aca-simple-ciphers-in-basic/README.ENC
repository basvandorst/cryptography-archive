              MIKE BARLOW'S SUPER PACK OF ENCIPHERING PROGRAMS
              ------------------------------------------------

      There are 28 or so separate programs on this disk, but the Vigeneres
have five sub choices, the Squares five, Quags, Aristos and Pats four, the
Autokeys three, the Checkerboards and the Columnars two, and the Railfence
also does Redefence, so you get more than you bargained for.

      All files are in ASCII. Files not ending in .ENC are dictionary or
example files. Ciphers that are not standard ACA fare, such as the Double
Transposition and Vernam, are in separate subdirectories.  I put
CRYPARIT.ENC in a separate subdirectory too, as it is not a completely
finished program - see CRYPARIT.DOC.

      All programs have default examples built-in, so just press <ENTER> in
answer to any prompt to see the demo. (One or two use "X for Example").

      All the SQUARE encs allow for ten possible Route selections of the
key. The CHECKERBOARD allows eight; the program could be simplified by using
the same square-routing routine as the SQUARE instead of the ROUTE TRANSP. (I
didn't realise the simplification possible by limiting the size to 5x5).

      The programs have been developed over several years, so their routines
and options may not be quite the same. NICODEME.ENC and CADENUS.ENC both have
the works; full data entry and storage routine as per CS #11, printout in Cm
format, etc. All programs except ROUTE and TRIFID have the the Cm print option
but no storage to disk, which I now think has little value. Similarly I don't
bother with the "Source" data any more. Most programs have either-case,
with-or-without blanks entry which is my standard for enciphering programs.
The other programs will be converted as time permits. Text entry is into a
string, so is limited to 240 chars. The ACA limits are usually less than this,
however. (And some are a bit weird - why 150-200 for a Grandpre, which could
give you a 600 char ciphertext? And different lengths for Complete and
Incomplete Columnars? And 385 input chars to a Pollux would give you nearly
2000 cipher digits).

      I am not proud of FM.ENC; it could be vastly cleaned up. It does work
however, and gives you a little sound message too. (In correct morse code).
GRANDPRE is also entertaining in automatic mode. The Square routers are fun
if you slow them right down so you can see the letters pop in.

      ENCPRT.ASC is the "print for the Cm" routine ready to merge with your
own program (See CS#12). You need to get your final ciphertext into OP$, and
the title of the cipher into TYPE$(NS). And put your own name in Line 9350!
This print-screen routine cannot be compiled, but for encipherments you are
not usually in a hurry. Most of these programs give an answer in a second
or two on an AT.

      Send your finished encipherments in to the Cm, and astound the Editors
with your prowess!

      Good enciphering -
                                Mike Barlow.

MODIFICATION RECORD
-------------------

Jan 1990 - CRYPARIT subdirectory added. All files put into ASCII rather than
tokenised GWBASIC.

Feb 16/90 - Homophonic and Railfence.encs added.

      I have added STDINPUT.BAS so that you can quickly make up enciphering
programs. This contains a standard data input routine similar to that in
CS #11 but for PLAINtext (no disk storage, no Source or crib prompts), the
standard printout routine ENCPRT.STD as in CS #12, the misc subs at
Line 5000-, and a print-in-fives routine around line 600.

      Load this and you've got most of the housekeeping done.   -MB

Feb 18/90 - Swagman.enc added.
Feb 25/90 - Vernam.enc added in subdirectory as it is a non-ACA cipher and
            the program has no frills.
March 27/90 - Aristocrat, Pat, Quags, Pollux.encs added.
April 2/90 - Morbit added.

**** Ciphers still missing are: Bacon, Bifid, Digrafid, Gromark and Per Grom,
Interrupted Key, Nihil T and S, Null, Seriated Playfair, Portax, Prog key,
Running Key, Slidefair, Tridigital. (15)

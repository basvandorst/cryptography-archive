                       DOUBLE TRANSPOSITION CIPHERS

      In 1986, Joseph Courville ("GUNG HO" of the American Cryptogram
Association) published a book entitled:

    Manual For Cryptanalysis Of The Columnar Double Transposition Cipher
    --------------------------------------------------------------------

with the subtitle "A Study Of Cryptanalysis". (Ref 1).

     This book discusses the Double Transposition cipher, a popular military
cipher in WWI, and which was still in limited use up to the beginning of WWII.
It is not a cipher in the repertory of the ACA, probably because of its
presumed difficulty.

     Part of this difficulty arises from the secrecy imposed on publication
of methods of solution, even though French amd English cryptanalysts were
able to read messages enciphered in this manner on the same day they appeared
in a new key - during WWI!

     Mr Courville's book addresses the problem of solution and the recovery
of the day's keys for both multiple messages in a single key, and a single
message. (His book also contains some problems worked in Spanish).

     The book is available from Mr Courville for $20 from 10240 Virginia Ave,
South Gate, CA 90280.

                               DISK FILES
                               ----------
    The file DT.ENC is a self-contained program in GWBASIC for the IBM, and
produces an encipherment of Mr Courville's example on page 2 of his book
using his key BOOKKEEPER. The resulting ciphertext is exactly as shown at
the bottom of page 3, starting MWFEW CIDYE OEXOM etc.

    The program contains Mr Courville's example as default entries. Thus
pressing <ENTER> in answer to any prompt will cause the default example to
be entered as data. Where there is ambiguity, an asterisk indicates the
default choice. In the case of selection of data entry from disk, file
GUNGHO.P2 must be present in the same subdirectory as DT.ENC for the
default entry to work. A "File Not Found" message will be seen if the file
is not present.

     No restrictions are put on the plaintext length except that it should
not exceed 240 characters when spaces are included. Longer texts require a
modification to the input routine starting at Line 9500. You will also
be in trouble with short keys and long texts running off the screen.

     The fourth paragraph on page 2 of the book is rather obscure, and I have
chosen to ignore this and simply make the plaintext (without spaces) a
multiple of five characters, if necessary padding via SUB 16000. No limit is
placed on keyword length except that imposed by the screen display, which
would in fact limit the length to 25 characters. Short keys and long texts
will also run the display off the screen; for a 10-letter key restrict the
text to about 150 chars. (A routine is present - but disabled - to cut the
length to 150 chars. See Lines 9662 and SUB 5030). There is room for ten rows
of text.

     In uncompiled BASIC on a 12MHz IBM AT, the example is enciphered in
about 2 seconds.

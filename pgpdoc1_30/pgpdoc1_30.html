<H1>Notice to Macintosh users</H1>
<P>PGP was originally developed for MSDOS and Unix machines.  There is
also an Apple Macintosh version of PGP.  This manual is
written for the MSDOS/Unix versions of PGP, which use a command-line
interface for all the PGP functions.  On the Mac, all the PGP
functions are accessed through pull-down menus and dialog boxes.
There is also on-line help on the Mac for how to use MacPGP, and there
should be some Mac-specific user documentation included in the MacPGP
release package, in addition to this manual.
<P>Almost all good Mac software applications are written from scratch
for the Mac, not simply ported there from other operating systems.  
Unfortunately, the current Mac version of PGP was not designed for
the Mac from scratch.  It was ported from the MSDOS/Unix version to
the Mac by Zbigniew Fiedorwicz.  Since the MSDOS/Unix version of PGP
was not designed for a GUI (graphical user interface), porting to the
Mac was not an easy task, and many bugs still remain.  An all-new
version of PGP is under development, designed for easy adaptation to
a GUI.  A new Mac version will be developed from this new PGP source
code.  It will be more Mac-like, and more reliable.  Despite the bugs
in the current version of MacPGP, it is important to note that if
Zbigniew had waited for this all-new version of PGP to be developed
before he ported PGP to the Mac, the world would have been deprived
of a Mac version of PGP for far too long.

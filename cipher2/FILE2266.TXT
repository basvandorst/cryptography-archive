If you are tired of word games which look dull and boring. Here's a     
colorful and challenging program that uses high-resolution graphics.    
                                                                        
CIPHER is a "crypto-quotes" type of game. A quotation is enciphered and 
displayed on the screen in its scrambled form. Your challenge is to     
figure out the cipher by replacing the scrambled letters with the       
actual letters. As you go along, more and more of the puzzle will start 
to look like real words. Eventually, you should be able to              
solve

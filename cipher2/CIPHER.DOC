       Various kinds of word puzzles have existed for years in many
       different forms.  People spend hours trying to solve them,
       working tediously with pencil and paper.  Many a newspaper has
       been worn through trying and retrying different solutions.
       
       With the advent of computers, working these puzzles becomes
       more enjoyable because the computer screen provides a working
       surface that's easier to manipulate than paper and pencil.  You
       can erase and retry as often as you wish and the screen will
       never wear out as paper is apt to do.
       
       Still, many computerized versions of word games look dull.  Just
       because it's a word game does not mean that it has to use text
       mode and black & white only.  Why can't word puzzles be colorful,
       use high resolution graphics and even run with a mouse?  Well,
       they can, now at least, because that's exactly how CIPHER
       works.  For those who don't have a mouse the game will run with
       keyboard only.  And if you don't have VGA/EGA graphics available
       it will also run in text mode (though it's still quite colorful
       if you have a color monitor).  But for those with a full featured
       PC you get what I hope is the most colorful and fun to use
       computerized word puzzle game available.
       
       CIPHER will automatically run in the "best" possible mode, though
       it is possible to override this.  The following command line
       parameters are available:
       
                     cipher -t      (force text mode)
                     cipher -k      (force keyboard mode)
       
       Note that when in text mode keyboard mode is automatically selected
       so it isn't necessary to use both overrides at any time.
       
       CIPHER is a "crypto-quotes" type of game.  That is, a quotation is
       enciphered and displayed on the screen in its scrambled form.  Your
       challenge is to figure out the cipher by replacing the scrambled
       letters with the actual letters.  As you go along more and more of
       the puzzle will start to look like real words and eventually you
       should solve the whole puzzle and be able to read the quotation.
       
       One set of puzzles is provided with the game.  If you want more,
       you can register the game for $15 and in exchange you'll receive
       the latest version of the game plus many more puzzles to solve.
       For $22 you can order the "deluxe" version of the game, which
       includes a registered copy of the software, the additional
       puzzles plus a printed manual and binder to store everything in.

       CIPHER is distributed by the Shareware system -- this allows you
       to try it before you buy it, but if you continue to use the game
       regularly you are expected to register.  When you register, please
       let me know what version you have (it's right on the title screen)
       and I'd also be interested to know where you got it from.  Please,
       make sure you put your name and address on your letter!  Or you 
       can use the instant registration form in the file "orderfrm.txt".
       Just copy the file to your printer, fill it out, and mail it.  If
       you're not familiar with the Shareware concept, please read the

       CIPHER is pretty easy to use, so rather than reading all the
       instructions you might want to just start it up and play.  The
       game has help screens built right in and they provide all the
       basic information you need.

*****************************************************************************


       OBJECT:
       
         The object of the game is to decipher the puzzle shown on the
         right side of the screen.  The puzzles vary in difficulty and
         size.  When you solve the puzzle correctly a message will pop
         up on the screen to let you know.
       
       
       KEYBOARD MODE COMMANDS:
       
         If you're going to be playing the game with a mouse, skip down
         to the "Mouse Mode Commands" section.  Also see the section on
         "Common Commands".
         
         When using the keyboard you will alternate between "select
         character" and "place character" modes.  You will see a prompt
         at the upper right corner of the screen to tell you what the
         game is expecting.
         
         You must first select a letter of the alphabet that you want
         placed into the puzzle.  Just type that single letter and it
         will be highlighted on the left hand side of the screen.
         
         Then you must decide where to place the highlighted letter
         into the puzzle.  Hit the letter that you want translated to
         the letter you just selected.  You'll see your selection placed
         throughout the puzzle.
         
         The game prevents you from using a letter to translate more
         than one encrypted letter.  Thus, if you change your mind on
         the translation of a letter you can just reuse the translated
         letter somewhere else and your previous use will be erased.
         
         If you want to erase a guess without placing it somewhere else,
         hit the space bar when asked to select a letter and then choose
         where to place it in the puzzle.
         
       
       MOUSE MODE COMMANDS:
       
         If you're going to be playing the game with the keyboard, go back
         to the "Keyboard Mode Commands" section.  Also see the section on
         "Common Commands".
         
         Unlike playing with a keyboard, playing using a mouse is "modeless"
         in that you do not have to alternate between selecting a character
         and placing it into the puzzle.  At the left side of the screen
         you'll see the alphabet displayed.  Click on the letter you want
         to select for use in the puzzle.  If your aim is off, just move
         the cursor and click again.  The letter you choose will be high-
         lighted.
         
         On the right side of the screen you'll see the puzzle.  After you
         have selected a letter point to the position in the puzzle where
         you want that letter used and click the mouse.  The letter will
         be placed at that position and at all other positions that have
         the same enciphered letter.
         
         The game prevents you from using a letter to translate more
         than one encrypted letter.  Thus, if you change your mind on
         the translation of a letter you can just reuse the translated
         letter somewhere else and your previous use will be erased.
         
         There are several options in addition to simply placing a
         letter.  If you click on the top half of a letter pair on
         the right side, all occurences of that letter throughout the
         puzzle will be highlighted but not filled in.  Clicking the
         right mouse button instead of the left one will remove your
         guess from the position in the puzzle being pointed to.
         
         
       COMMON COMMANDS:

         Along the top line of the screen you'll see a number of
         commands displayed.  If you're playing using a keyboard you
         will also see the name of the function key that activates
         the commands.  If you're using a mouse you just move the
         cursor up to the command and point and click.  Mouse users
         can also use the function keys though the key numbers are
         not displayed.
         
         The available commands are as follows:
         
         F1 - Help
         
           Supplies several screens of basic information on how to play
           the game.  Each screen has the option to go to the next screen,
           previous screen, or to quit help.  Mouse users just point to
           their selection; keyboard users should hit "N" (next), "P"
           (previous), or "Q" (quit) as desired.
         
         F2 - Info
         
           Provides some basic information on the game and how to register.
           Hit a key or click the mouse to remove the info window.
         
         F3 - Filer
         
           The filer has a number of subfunctions:
           
           1)  Next Puzzle -- if you're stuck on the current puzzle or
               don't want to play it select next puzzle to get the next
               consecutive puzzle in the puzzle file.
           
           2)  Previous Puzzle -- if you want to go back to a previous
               puzzle use this command.  You will use this command fairly
               seldom because previous puzzles are ones you've already
               played.
           
           3)  Select by Number -- lets you select any puzzle within the
               current puzzle file by entering its number.  Handy if two
               people want to play the same puzzle.

           4)  Change Puzzle File -- this command allows you to load a
               different puzzle file.  All puzzle files end with the file
               extension ".cpz".  The shareware version of the game only
               comes with one puzzle file so this command won't be useful
               until you register the game.
           
           5)  Save Game -- use this command to save the current puzzle
               along with your guesses to a disk file.  All saved game
               files use the file extension ".csv"; it's optional
               whether you type this in or not when entering the file
               name.
           
           6)  Load Game -- use this command to reload a puzzle that you
               saved previously.  Select the name of the saved game file
               you want from the displayed list.
           
           7)  Make Puzzle -- this function lets you enter puzzles from
               other sources and have them stored in a CIPHER compatible
               file.  The puzzle you enter is expected to already be
               encrypted and should be entered in a form similar to normal
               CIPHER puzzles; that is, enter up to four lines of puzzle
               and then put the author's name on the last line with two
               dashes in front of it.

               When you select this function you are first asked for
               the name of the puzzle file.  If you're adding to an
               existing user defined puzzle file just select it from
               the list.  If you want to start a new file, type in
               the name of the new file.  It is not necessary to enter
               the .cpz portion of the file name (that is, "puzzle" is
               enough, you do not need to enter "puzzle.cpz").

               Once the file has been selected, a small box will open
               in which to type in your new puzzle.  When you have
               the puzzle entered correctly, hit the enter key twice
               and you'll be prompted to confirm; hit "Y" if the
               puzzle is correct and it will be saved.  At the
               present time there are no editing capabilities
               available so if you make a mistake your only option is
               to not save the puzzle and to start over.

               User defined puzzle files are slightly different from
               normal CIPHER puzzles, so do not try to add your own
               puzzles into the standard puzzle files.  You also lose
               one normal feature of the game when using your own
               puzzles: the game can't determine when you've solved the
               puzzle.

           8)  Clear Guesses -- use this function if you want to clear
               all your previous guesses and start the current puzzle
               over again.  It also marks the puzzle as being unplayed;
               use this if you want to quit but play the current puzzle
               next time you play.

           9)  Abort -- select this if you changed your mind about doing
               a filer function.
         
         F4 - Hints
         
           1)  See Puzzle -- If a puzzle gets too frustrating you can
               "cheat" and see the solution.  Once you've done this the
               puzzle is marked in the puzzle file as having been played
               to completion.

           2)  Get Hint --  This allows you to get a hint on a single
               letter.  Enter the encrypted letter from the puzzle that
               you would like to see the matching unencrypted letter for
               and this letter will be entered throughout the puzzle.

           3)  Clear Wrong Guesses -- Selecting this will remove all
               letters from the puzzle that are incorrect.

           4)  Show Letter Frequencies -- It's well known that some 
               letters of the alphabet are used much more often than
               others.  In the English language, the most common letters,
               in order, are generally ETOANIRSH.  Knowing this fact and
               knowing which letters in the puzzle appear most often is
               a strong clue.  This hint will show all letters of the
               alphabet along with the number of times they appear in
               the puzzle.

           5)  Abort -- Select this if you change your mind about
               getting a hint.

         F5 - Options

           1)  See Hall of Fame -- Using this option you can see the
               all time high score list at any time.

           2)  Select New Player -- Use this option to let a different
               player use the game.  You will select the player name
               you want from a list, or you can enter a new player name
               or change an existing player name and use that.

           3)  Switch Score/Clock -- The lower left corner of the screen
               can display either the current time or a running score.
               Use this option to toggle between the two choices.

           4)  Sound On/Off -- Use this option to toggle sound on or
               off.

           5)  Select Colors -- You can customize your screen colors
               with this option.  Your selected colors will be stored
               so that your last selections will automatically be
               loaded whenever you play.  Each player can have their
               own color selections.

           6)  Switch Mouse/Keyboard -- If you're running in graphics
               mode you can use this option to switch between mouse
               and keyboard play at any time.

           7)  Abort -- Use this if you decide not to use one of the
               options.

         F10 - Quit
         
           This quits the game.  You'll be prompted just to make sure that
           you really meant to quit and also if you want to save the game
           if you did not complete it.
         
         
       COMMAND LINE OPTIONS:
         
         Normally you start the game by just entering "CIPHER".  The game
         will determine your hardware configuration and select the correct
         modes automatically.  It will then ask you for the name of the
         player and the puzzle file you wish to use.  There are a couple
         of options available that can be entered on the command line if
         you wish though.
         
         The first two parameters let you override the default hardware
         selections.  Use "-t" to run in text mode even if VGA or EGA is
         available.  Use "-k" to play using the keyboard even if you have
         a mouse attached.

         You can also select the player from the command line.  The game
         stores up to nine player names, so to use a specific name use the
         parameter "-p#", replacing the # with a digit from 1 through 9
         for the number of the desired player.

         The game normally shows the running score in the lower left
         corner of the screen.  You can change this to show the time of
         day instead, which you'd normally do using the Options menu.  If
         you want to start up the game with the clock showing, use the
         parameter "-c".

         You can disable sounds by using the parameter "-s".
         
         The final option lets you enter the name of the puzzle file you
         want to use.  The original shareware version only comes with one
         puzzle file so you won't need this option until you've registered.
         
         Some examples:
         
         If you want to play in text mode, you'd enter the following:
         
                                 cipher -t
         
         To use the puzzle file called "puzzle2.cpz" you'd enter:
         
                            cipher puzzle2.cpz
         
         To play using the keyboard and use the puzzle file "puzzle3.cpz"
         you'd enter:
         
                          cipher puzzle3.cpz -k
         
         Note that in the last example the order of the options does not
         matter.  You must have spaces between the options.

         Command line parameter summary:

             -t   Force text mode (also forces keyboard mode)
             -k   Force keyboard mode
             -p#  Select player number #
             -c   Show clock in lower left corner of screen
             -s   Disable sound


       CIPHER RECORD KEEPING

         The game tries to keep track of which puzzles you've played in an
         intelligent manner.  In general, it expects you to play the
         puzzles within a file in order so when you select a puzzle file it
         automatically loads the first puzzle within that file that you
         have not tried yet.  When you've tried all the puzzles within a
         file, you're given the option of going back to the beginning and
         playing those puzzles you didn't solve the first time through.

         These records are kept separately for each player, by player
         number.  Changing a player's name does not change the records for
         that player number within the puzzle files you use.


       CIPHER SCORING SYSTEM

         The scoring system is fairly simple.  When you start a puzzle you
         are given 1000 points.  One point is ticked off every second, so
         the faster you solve the puzzle the higher your score.  Clear
         Wrong Guesses and Get Hint will cost you 10 points each time you
         use them.  Using Show Letter Frequencies doesn't cost any points,
         but the clock does continue to run while you're looking at the
         frequency list so you're losing one point per second.  Using Show
         Puzzle sets your score to zero.

         If you solve the puzzle, you get a 100 point bonus.  You get an
         additional 100 points if you did not use any of the hint
         functions.  If you managed to solve the puzzle with no wrong
         guesses you get a 100 point bonus.  Finally, you get 20 points for
         each correct letter and lose 10 points for each wrong guess you
         made before solving the puzzle.

         If your score is one of the top ten it will be entered into the
         Hall of Fame and the hall will automatically be displayed.  If you
         wish to clear the Hall of Fame, just delete the file HALLFAME.LST.

       CALLDOOR:  A PCBoard 14.x door that lets users view the system caller

       WAITDV:    A sysop's utility that allows synchronizing of nightly
                  house keeping events on a multinode system.  WAITDV was
                  written especially for systems running under DESQview: it's
                  DV-aware so the active task runs much faster than it would
                  if a non-aware wait utility was used.

       TOPPERS:   A PCBoard 14.x sysop utility that generates a formatted
                  list of the board's top users (by number of calls,
                  downloads and uploads).  The output file has three columns,
                  one for each category.  Graphics and non-graphics output
                  is available.
       
       TOPTALK:   A PCBoard 14.x sysop utility that tracks user activity in
                  conferences based on number of messages posted.  Included
                  is a complete record of all user activity plus a bulletin
                  file of the top ten most active message posters.
       
       GROUPERS:  A PCBoard 14.x game door.  Players gamble on the outcome
                  of the next card drawn from the deck.  The game is set up
                  to run as a monthly contest and keeps track of current
                  scores, generates a current scores bulletin and an end of
                  month final scores bulletin.

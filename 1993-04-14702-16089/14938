This is a most interesting development, and I doubt it will be long
before somebody does exactly this.

But consider that even without a cryptographic module per se, DOS 6.0
is really going to complicate life for law enforcement types who try
to use Norton Utilities (or similar raw disk utilities) to search for
"interesting" stuff that might be hidden on a seized computer's hard
disk.

Not only will they no longer be able to search for plaintext text
patterns in the raw disk blocks, but deleted files will be virtually
impossible to recover even with more sophisticated means once the
first block(s) have been overwritten by new data.

Obviously, ordinary files will still be accessible.  I'm sure
encryption modules will appear soon enough to take care of this minor
detail.

But given that random fragments of compressed data will be very hard
to distinguish from encrypted data, clever ways of hiding even the
existence of encrypted data (should the use of encryption become
"regulated") will become all that much easier with DOS 6.

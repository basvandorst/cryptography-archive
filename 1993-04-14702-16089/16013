These things minic the light system used by fireflies.  There are two chemicals
One is a catalytic enzime that causes a chemical change in the other chemical
in the process some light is emitted.  The enzime is not used up by the process
but the other chemical is.  So there is no way to mechanically reverse 
things.  The tube contains a water solution so you can halt the process
by freezing, which machanically spearates the chemicals, but doesn't rechange
things at all.

I believe the chemicals are totaly non-toxic to almost everything.

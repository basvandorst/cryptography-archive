I'd like to know if there's a fairly simple non-linear method of combining
several (3 or more) streams of data into a single stream that would
make the recovery of the streams moderately difficult.  Some of the
streams would be some type of pseudorandom sequence, and I would like
to make the result more difficult to predict.  As I am a total novice
in the area of cryptography, I looked around for various crypto
implementations that seemed to do what I was looking for.  About the
only thing I found in my (very limited) search was the auxiliary functions
F, G, H, and I defined in the MD5 documentation.  These functions, which
combine 3 32-bit words into a single word do not seem to fit my needs.
One of the functions (H, I believe) is simply an XOR of the three input
words.  The others, while apparently non-linear, seem to bias the output
stream to one or more of the input streams (there is a high degree of
correlation between input and output).  I think this might be a "wedge"
that would be fatal to my application.  I realize this is not a weakness
for MD5, where several other operations are performed on the data.
 
Can anyone give me any pointers that might help out?  Please reply via
E-mail and I will summarize if there is suitable interest.  Thanks in
advance.

Thanks to Perry E. Metzger (ref: <1993Apr1.200536.11452@shearson.com>)
for supporting my original concern about the vulnerability of PGP on
BBSs.

I'd like to extend my healthy paranoia on the subject past my (recently 
recognized) bias against BBSs to include any host where PGP is made 
available (anon ftp, mail servers, news postings, whatever).

Vinc Duran's suggestion in <1993Apr2.053803.27130@mnemosyne.cs.du.edu>
about posting PGP to the net misses the original point made in this 
thread (which I don't seem to have on-hand...5 day retention...ooooo, I 
hate that!).  The original suggestion was to foster the grassroots spread
of PGP through increased efforts to get it onto lots and lots of BBSs.

TOPIC REFOCUS ATTEMPT...  rather than debate the percentage of 
trustworthy sites, I'd like to see discussion on how to avoid having 
that trust in the first place.  What methods can be used to ensure that 
the recipient of a PGP distribution can be confident that what they have 
is the same as was generated by Phil, Branko, and friends?

Getting multiple copies from a variety of sites was one recent 
suggestion.  Getting and building set of trusted keys seems like a
prerequisite (aka roadblock) for verification, but this provides maximum 
security.  I asked about methods to help increase confidence in the
sources (not just executables).  Is stand-alone verifiability possible?
It would be nice, since many of these grassroots newbies won't have 
a prior version of PGP to check the new (their first) version out with.
With so many intelligent and wise folks out there, I'm surprised that
this issue isn't making more progress.  Am I out in left field?

I hope it's clear that I am a PGP proponent.  I think spreading it is a
good thing.  I just want methods to ensure secure distribution of this
security based software.

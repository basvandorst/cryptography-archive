I replied privately to Stanton McCandlish, but RSA/PKPs blackmail attempts
require a response.

If PGP violates RSAs patents, then only executing PGP could be a violation.
Distributing PGP could be contributory infringement, but the PGP
documentation seemed sufficient to me to protect distributors (before I
deleted it -- using PGP might be a patent violation in the US, so I have no
need to keep it.)

You have no legal action you can take, unless you believe you can prove
someone is using PGP in the US, for a purpose other than that specifically
allowed by patent laws.  (Not entirely correct, anyone can sue for any
reason, but, you cannot prevail unless you can prove that by a prepoderance
of evidence).  Under patent laws, PGP does have legitimate uses, as a means
to study your algorithm, in order to produce improvements (which would
still require your approval to execute, until the patent runs out around
2000).

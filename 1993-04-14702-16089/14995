Well, I'm no lawyer, but I'll supply some ancedotal evidence which may
change your mind.  ** Note ** I do not agree AT ALL with what went on in
this case, and neither will most of you.  THAT DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT 
THAT IT *DID* HAPPEN.  Right here in America even.....

About three or four years ago, there was a rather nasty custody case in
or around Washington D.C.  The upshot was, an ex-husband was suing for 
visitation rights, which were granted.  The woman believed that the man
had been sexually molesting her children.  (much like Allen/Farrow, but
not as famous).  Anyhows, she spirits away the kids and refuses to tell the
court where they are, and denies him visitation rights.

She "keeps her mouth shut", and what happens?  She SITS IN JAIL for almost
a year, on CONTEMPT OF COURT, until the legislature passes a special law
limiting the time a person can be held.  If they hadn't passed the law, she'd
most likely still be there.  The kids were in New Zealand, I belive.

Now (story finished, commetary starting)....  IMHO, the only reason the
legislature moved was because there was an outpouring of public sympathy
for this woman...  most people believed she was right, and were outraged.
Not likely to happen for Joe Random Drug Dealer, Child Molester or perfectly
innocent privacy lover, who might have something
to hide.  Innocent until proven guilty doesn't mean you get to walk out
of court humming a happy tune because the FBI can't read your disk.  Just
ask those held for contempt, those who can't make bail, etc, etc.

Again.... I disagree totally with the concept of holding someone based
on suspicion, but people who keep thinking that it won't happen are bound
to get a rude shock when it does......

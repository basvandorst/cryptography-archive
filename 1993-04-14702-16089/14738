*good question* :-)  I don't know for sure, but I guess *importing*
it might be subject to prior allowance.

Assume pgp ueses following mechanism. (pgp-experts correct me if this
has changed, it is some time ago, that I have read the sources)
data-> Encrypt(R1+R1+Data,Key) meaning that for the purpose of encryption
the data is prefixed with a random byte (word?) whis is used twice.
So when decrypting the file, just check if the two first bytes (words?) are
equal.
This might be usefull for any kind of attack on PGP Idea ciphertext. 
Allowing a fast check, if the choosen key is right :-) ) Until now,
nobody I know of, was able to use this in an attack on IDEA...

This is not yet checked. I simply do not know if using IDEA two times
with a different key would result in an usage of IDEA with just one
(different) key.

if you can ftp, check for 'ufc_crypt', which contains a rather fast
DES-implemntation...

There is a paper in the net (*grin*), which contains the original
description of IDEA, and a sample source. You may check with David
Vincetti or Vesselin Bontchew where these archives are. I do not
have the address at hand. If you can't ftp, mail me - and I'll send
it to you.

IDEA most probably will never become a replacement for DES (other perhaps
than as a 'de facto standard' for certain users like the pgp-world) as
for USA-purposes it is labeled 'not invented here' :-)))) 
No I guess that NBS/NSA follow another philosophy for secure encryption.
Ask somebody in the states about RC2 & the like.

IDEA is patented in Switzerland. It has no export restriction from 
Switzerland :-) But you have to check (if you care) whether you may import
it to the USA.
You may use it at no fee for non-commercial applications.
Just do not gain money with it.

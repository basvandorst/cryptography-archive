Also, the property of equiprobable distribution is often NOT
desirable because by proper selection of the hash function
to reduce collisions you can reduce time consuming rehashing
or chaining. Radix hashing over smooth input sets is probably
the ultimate expression of this, but even for vaguer input
models like English words you can spread out the "birthdays"
much better than, say, DES or MD5.  (The CCITT crc for example).

This is true even though (to my knowledge) that empirically
figuring out the optimal hash function (for a given input
set compute the function that gives you NO collisions at all)
is a non-P problem.  See Knuth.

"Hashing" describes a set of algorithms that have only a
Wittgensteinian "familial" resemblence. Progress begets diversity?

1.  If the pad's really random, then one-time pad encryption is provably
secure.
 
2.  If your one-time-pad is really random, then *any* method of mapping
A op B = C; B other_op C = A   will work.  (For XORing, op = other_op = XOR)
 
   The big thing to remember with a one-time pad is that the one-time pad
needs to be random.  It's not enough to just use the output from a pseudo-
random number generator, or the text from a book, because those will produce
one-time pads that have some characteristics that could be useful to someone
trying to break your system.
 
   PGP uses keystroke-timings from users to generate random information.  How-
ever, for large numbers of random bytes (or bits), this would be cumbersome.
Other ways of coming up with random bits are occasionally discussed here.  They
always include some physical event or trial that is impossible or very hard to
preedice ahead of time.  (Rolling dice, radioactive decay, radio static, etc.)

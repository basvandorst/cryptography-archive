While what you suggest is probably true, in general, I certainly have not
found it to be necessary for the crackable historical systems.  For such
systems, I have found the monograph or digraph frequencies in English to
be very workable for Italian, German, Spanish, and French cryptograms.

As for MSDOS EXE and GIF and so forth, I think a frequency count of those
files would be very interesting.  Someone got a "counter" to run a representative
sample through?  Even for monogram frequencies, I bet there'd be a few 
surprises.

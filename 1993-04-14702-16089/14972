In an ideal world, reader software would do the best it can with the
resources available.  If somebody sends text in Greek and your terminal
can only render ASCII, the software would try to show some approximation
of the characters.  If somebody sends a picture and you don't have a
graphics display, the software would either try to give you a low-res
approximation using characters, or just give up and put in a little
note saying "there's a picture here but I can't show it to you".  If
somebody sends audio and you have no sound output, the software would
probably have to put up such a note (although I'm told that at Bellcore,
the note says "I can't reproduce the sound on your workstation, but if
you tell me your phone number, I can play it over the phone"!).  In
any event, the software would do the best it could to present the parts
of the message that *could* be presented, somehow, on your hardware.

In real life, particular software packages will have minimum hardware
requirements, below which their fallback methods won't be very graceful.

MIME does provide for sending a message which contains multiple versions
of the content, so that you can ship (say) both a PostScript copy and
an ASCII-characters copy of a diagram, and the recipient will see the
best one that his hardware/software can display.

Many of the facilities of MIME are potentially very useful even if you
don't have a fancy display; MIME is not just multi-media.

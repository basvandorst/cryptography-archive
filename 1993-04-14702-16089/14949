Hi, is ther anyone out there who could provide me with some advise on 
achieving secure communications for a bbs system.

The basic idea is as follows:

A candidate user is provided with a special coms prog which implements 
his/her key which will enable the cyphering/decyphering of signals 
transmitted after login.

On login to the BBS the key for the current user is retrieved and 
activated.

What I'm looking for is to achieve nonrepeatance for at least 5 hours. 
The whole thing should be software based (sysop nor users are rich 
ennough for hardware scramblers).

Any suggestions,please by Email or posted here.

Thanking in advance greetings -Newkid

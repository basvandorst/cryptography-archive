If it even gets that far.  Most recent DOS versions load SMARTDRV, which
will probably cache all but the final overwrite, and maybe not even
that if the file is deleted before the cache is flushed.

(That was one of the first optimizations for a caching database, so DOS
probably has it as well).

I plan on writing the _Microsoft Systems Journal_ for information on how
to force flushing thru SMARTDRV (other than through the command line) and/or
to clear the entire block.  Since this is, or was, the official Microsoft
rag they should have an answer.  I hope.

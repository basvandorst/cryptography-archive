Another relevant question is, who pays the cost and who gets the benefit? 
For example, do the phone company and its suppliers end up subsidizing the
FBI?  And if the phone company gets reimbursed, in the sense that
regulatory agencies allow it a rate increase to cover its costs, does this
amount to a phone tax to pay for the privilege of being wiretapped (or, if
you prefer, a disguised increase in the FBI budget)?

     I am looking for a suggestion for a specific encoding algorithm.
I want this algorithm to be as secure as possible. I am not concerned
about how much time the encoding takes (as long as it is doable on an
average workstation in several hours). In fact, the encoding should
take a long time (to prevent exhaustive searches), since it will not
be performed often. The encoding will be applied to phrases in the
english language. What is a good choice for such an algorithm? What
can be proven (mathematically) about how hard it would be to invert it
or to do an exhaustive search? Is there a reference on it? And
finally, what is a good general book on the various kinds of one-way
encoding algorithms? Please reply to mlevin@husc8.harvard.edu.

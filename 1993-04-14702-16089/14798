[I have deleted news.admin.policy from the Newsgroups: line because I
don't see what this has to do with that group.  I don't think it has
much to do with comp.admin.policy either, actually.]

(This is only a semantic quibble, but since you've posted the same
incorrect information twice in a row I'll mention it:  the document you
quote rather explicitly says that RSA only must be implemented in
compliant implementations if they utilize asymmetric key management.
You can use PEM with just DES and not RSA, it's just that key
management is a pain and you don't get non-deniability of origin.)

PKP has allowed non-commercial use of a package created by RSADSI
called RSAREF to anyone who wants it (within the area where the U.S.
government will allow them to do so.)  A variety of different
applications have been written utilizing its routines; the most
prominent of them is probably RIPEM.

PGP, on the other hand, is copyrighted code written by someone else.
The two situations are not identical, or even particularly close.
(This is not to say that I don't think PKP should license PGP or allow
free non-commercial use.)

In any case, I hope that the appropriate bodies will follow through to
verify whether some kind of written guarantee is on record with some
appropriate standards body.  But it's not at all clear to me that
"reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms" necessarily includes "will
allow production and distribution of software utilizing these routines
with licensing arrangements made with end users wherein the producers
and distributors are not liable for any infringement."  Maybe it does.

You keep making misleading statements.  Riordan's code without
RSADSI's library does not contain an implementation of the RSA
algorithm, and thus no license has been given to him (nor is such
required, unless there's a patent violation in the address-parsing
routines or something) that you can't get too.

One could argue that, by allowing RSADSI (and TIS) to create a "free"
for non-commercial use version of RSA, nondiscriminatory access
requires that PKP allow anybody else who wants to as well.  Not sure
how that one would fly.  Why don't you ask the PEM developers?

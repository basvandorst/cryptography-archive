I have used archie, ftp, and now the past expire's worth of sci.crypt, but I
still don't have a clear answer.  I am hoping you folks can give me one.
Please reply to me, and I will summarize to the group if appropriate.

I want to encode a file such that I can put the encoded file and a little
decoder program up for anonymous ftp and give a key to someone over the phone
which they will be able to use in conjunction with the decoder to regenerate
the original file at their site.

This has obvious uses for secure distribution of information and programs.

So, how do I do it?  I don't want to pay more than a nominal fee, and I don't
want to spend more than an afternoon building whatever SW.

Is RIPEM the answer?  

If I can't find an easy way to use "real" cryptography, I'll just concoct a
hack (cipher) using things like compress, tar, uuencode, rot13, etc.  With
permutations and combinations, I should be able to get something that's enough
of a hurdle in short order.

However, it just seems a shame not to use the real stuff when so many people
have spent so much effort on it :-)

Thanks in advance for any info -- Peter

P.S. And PLEASE - no pointers to multi-hundred page primers on crpytography.
I have more of those than I will ever finish reading, and they aren't going to
solve my problems, anyway.

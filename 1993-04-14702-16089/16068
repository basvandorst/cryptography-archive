How do we know that there isn't an accidental "back door" that even
the NSA doesn't know about? The chances are small, but nonzero. But
the best way to find out is to publish the algorithm openly and let
the worldwide academic cryptologic community attack it over many
years.

Historically, the NSA may be good at what they do, but takes only one
brilliant young cryptologist to see brand new insights that even the
NSA hasn't seen. And the NSA might not yet have recruited that
particular cryptologist, especially if he or she is not a US citizen.

Who knows, maybe at this moment he or she is doing a doctoral thesis
in Israel, or toiling away as a clerk in the Swiss patent office...

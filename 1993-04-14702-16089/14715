I think there may be two different views on "triple encryption".  I've always
heard E-D-E described as triple-encryption, and I've never heard anyone talk
about an approach using encryption with three separate keys.

It appears there is a difference in interpreting what "triple" refers to.

   - In your mind, it refers to the number of unique 56-bit keys applied.

   - In my mind (and others I know), it refers to the number of DES
     encryptions performed, and does not imply three distinct keys.

I know of at least one widespread cryptographic architecture that defines
triple-encryption as E-D-E with a double-length key.  I don't know if there
are others that define it the other way.  Anyone know of examples?  This
could wind up being a problem if people think they're talking about
compatible functions, but really have two different things in mind.

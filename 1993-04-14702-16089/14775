In fact, in the UK a marketing agency did a survey some years ago to be
able to factor a list of names into (likely) age groups.  Eg, someone called 
Alexis would be about 8 years (or whenever Dynasty was popular), and the
typical Margret >50 say.  There are correlations with royalty, famous
footballers (witness the deluge of Johans in Dutch when Johan Cruyff was
playing), TV soaps, etc.

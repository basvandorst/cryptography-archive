Norton Utilities for the Mac has a disk wipe program which
claims to do just that.  It wipes all free space including
empty space at the end of partialy filled blocks.  It also
has a three pass "government" mode.

BTW I have not been able to get pgp to produce a signature
that I can attatch to the end of this message.  What is 
the procedure?  Thanks.

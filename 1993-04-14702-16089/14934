You want the encrypted data to masquerade as part of program.  Simply 
attaching the data to the end of the file won't cut it -- it's too easy
to show the data is unrelated (e.g, the program runs fine if the trailer
is cut off).

Removing data from the middle of a data segment, or better yet from within
the code segment, is a far more difficult task.

Hiding them in viruses would work, but how long do you think it will be
until possession of virus source code is a crime?  :-(

(Just to make it clear, I don't condone writing viruses.  I just have a
vivid imagination and deep dispair of ever having a technically-competent
legislature.  Imagine, if you will, a law making it illegal to make BIOS
disk calls, without an exemption for the operating system or bona fide
utilities!).

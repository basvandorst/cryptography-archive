I can't imagine doing that.

I personally don't plan to have a copy of the chip in my posession for any
purpose.  There are perfectly good RSA and DES chips -- although for most
uses, I would just use software (especially in my computer designs).

DES may not be as good as Skipjack -- but it's good enough for me.

I don't want NSA-level encryption.  All I want is encryption good enough
to foil private-enterprise criminals (and I trust DES for that -- at least
when it's tripled) and secrecy of keys.

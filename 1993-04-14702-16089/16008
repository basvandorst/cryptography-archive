Nope.  That's outside their mission.  The NSA does not do enforcement of any 
kind.  The do signals intelligence, and provide expertise in cryptography and 
other signals intelligence related disciplines.  Disclosing intercepts with 
anyone beyond the entity which requested them is a severe violation of their 
own security requirements, and analysis of those intercepts is out of their 
jurisdiction.  Even in attempts to squeeze down on civilian cryptography, the 
NSA acts solely in an advisory capacity.  They have to hand things off to 
some other agency (generally the State Dept.) for actual enforcement.

As anyone who's dealt with the NSA can tell you, information may go in, but 
it doesn't come out unless you're the one who requested (and was cleared) for 
that particular piece.

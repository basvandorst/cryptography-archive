Being paranoid is valuable. PGP is now in use around the world in many
places where speaking freely can get you 15 years of rock breaking or
worse.  Cryptography is often a life or death matter, as Kahn points
out repeatedly in "The Codebreakers". By making sure that your new
copy of PGP is always trustworthy, you will have one less thing to
worry about. Given that altering PGP to make it so weak as to be
useless requires alterations to only a few lines of code, this is
important.

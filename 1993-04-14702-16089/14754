   Mike Godwin of the EFF talked about this at his workshop at CPF '93.
   If I remember him correctly, he said that the courts would probably
   not consider an order to disclose keys as self-incrimination.
   (whether they *should* is a different question.)



how is forcing somebody to hand over keys to their hard drive any
different from forcing them to hand over keys to the filing cabinet?

if there is a warrant, then handing over the keys is required, and if
there isn't, then it shouldn't be required.

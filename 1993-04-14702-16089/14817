[suggestion of conspiracy between the NSA and RSA because RIPEM is licensed
and PGP not, omitted]

No conspiracy theories are needed. A far simpler explanation is a
combination of protecting their patents, and protecting their commercial
markets, is what is going on.

The curious reader wishing for details is invited either to:

a. Think it through
b. Consult RSA
c. Consult an attorney

as to why the above should be so. I'm not being brusque here, just trying
to avoid another interminable thread from an argument about the details.

I will provide one hint: it is reported that RSA expressed puzzlement (at
their conference) that nobody has asked for permission to use RIPEM to
write a PGP-compatible program.

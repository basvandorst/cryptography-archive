The U.S. munitions import list is available from the department of state,
office of munitions control. See 22 CFR 121.1. (Code of Federal Regulations).

Among other dandies like Tanks, Ballistic Missiles, Spacecraft and 
Nuclear Weapons Test Equipment, a great catch-all at the end:

Category XXI - Miscellaneous Articles:

	Any Article not specifically enumerated in the other categories
	of the U.S. Munitions List which has substantial military
	applicability and which has been specifically designed or
	modified for military purposes. The decision on whether any
	article may be included in this category shall be made by the
	Director, Office of Munitions Control, Department of State,
	with the concurrence of the Department of Defense.

I would guess that encryption devices would qualify as having substantial
military applicability. Note that the decision is made by appointed
officials without having to get congress involved.

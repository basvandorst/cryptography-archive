Sorry, gang.  It was the first example that came to mind.

There are devices which emit projectiles or which themselves physically
enter a person's body in order to damage that body, causing physical harm
or death.  Those can be physical, chemical, biological or radiological
intrusions into a person's body.

Then there are devices which might be used as part of a chain of events
which might end up in the application of the first class of device against
someone.  Cryptography is clearly in this latter category.

I appreciate the importance of the latter to an army but I definitely don't
appreciate the attempt to sidetrack a discussion by diluting the definition
of "weapon" to include things which have no direct physical effect.

-------

And, to play devil's advocate, cryptography might be a weapon in these
terms because its existence in private hands drives certain people
(eg., in the FBI or NSA) crazy.  That's stretching it a little,
however.  :-)

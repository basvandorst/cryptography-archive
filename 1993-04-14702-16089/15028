I agree with you.  Also consider that a cryptographer who analyzes RC2 or
RC4 would not be able to publish his work.  I have been trying to get a list
of cryptographers who have analyzed either algorithm under a NDA, but so
far RSADSI has not answered my request.

On the other hand, Ron Rivest is a respected cryptographer.  It is likely
that these algorithms are better than the run-of-the-mill snake oil you
see from people who don't know better.

I share your skepticism.  The lack of public comment and peer review should
be enough to scare off anyone who knows about cryptography.  RSADSI has never
presented any evidence to support their claim that the "security depends
entirely on the key size YOU SELECT."  Certainly review by the "best technical
people" at their customers is hardly an endorsement.  And NSA's willingness
to let the algorithm be exported doesn't help RSADSI's case for the algorithm's
security.

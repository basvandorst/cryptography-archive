  a pen register is a gizmo that sits on the line
and records phone numbers dialed (and, presumably,
how long the calls last).

  it seems unlikely that a pen register could be
converted to "do wiretaps."  maybe the line the
register is on could be.  i'm not a phone system
wizard, so caveat that.

  to prove phone fraud (e.g. illegal use of sprint
or mci codes) the feds can get a warrant to put a
pen register on the line.  i saw one being
disconnected; it was a fairly innocuous box that
printed on cash-register type tape [a lot like one
of those A.C. power monitors you can buy]; it was
installed in an above-ground telco box, about a
mile from the house that was being raided.  the
secret service guy mumbled something about high
impedance and loopback to the local exchange.  i'm
not a phone system guru, he was reticent, so i
didn't get much more info.

  in the case i was involved in (a bunch of people
in the the north carolina research triangle area
were trading stolen credit card numbers and
sprint/mci access codes on atari based BBSs) the
secret service put pen registers on lines [they
had an informant, they told me, so they knew which
ones], accumulated a certain amount of fraud
according to the registers (a kilobuck or so --
the DA's threshold varies from district to
district), then moved in and confiscated just
about everything computer-related.

  i remarked to foley that the remotest bit of
crypto on the bss systems would have the feds
scrambling; i assume that's why they had the
registers on the lines -- the credit card numbers
and so forth on the computers' disks were just
icing on the cake as far as they were concerned.
i don't even know if the info made it to court.

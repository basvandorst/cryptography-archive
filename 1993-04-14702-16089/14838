There is no guarantee that the deleted space would be overwritten during
optimization.  Likely, but no guarantee.  A quicker and more secure method
would be a batch file that overwrote all of your free space.  For example
fill.bat:
	echo %1 >> out
	fill.bat
(This is off the top of my head.  #include <std_disclaimer.h>)

fill huge.zip or girlie.bmp should overight your free space, then del out gives
it back to you.  This is as good as you can do quick and dirty.  For better
protection, there are plenty of wipedisk type utilities out in pd.

                                    of Saddam Hussien was one of their goals.
They failed, of course.  Seems as though that motorcade through downtown Dallas
trick only works once.

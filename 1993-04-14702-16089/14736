Sorry I don't have time to rehash the arguments right now, but I
found articles <1992Nov20.202421.16963@rchland.ibm.com> and
<1992Nov17.200839.20405@rchland.ibm.com> to be good arguments
against legislating cryptography.

For the bulk of you who don't have these articles handy, there
is a sci.crypt archive on rpub.cl.msu.edu (in directory
/pub/crypt/sci.crypt).

(Also sorry about the late follow-up; I'm about 6 weeks behind
on sci.crypt right now; just noticed this...)

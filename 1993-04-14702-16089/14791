Well, I'd say that verifying the signature on a new version of PGP by using
an old one is just as appropriate when obtaining PGP from the net as it is
when downloading it from a BBS.  I don't think every FTP site in the world
maintains bulletproof levels of paranoia, to say nothing of what could happen
if you depend on a uuencoded version obtained through mail or a newsgroup...

I also think that users who aren't paranoid enough or skilled enough to
adequately verify a copy of PGP they obtain from a BBS have a very high
likelihood of getting an unhacked copy.  Generally hacked copies don't spread
nearly as far as valid copies.  For one thing, the original generally goes
out first.  No site that got a valid copy before the hack was made is likely
to waste time getting another copy unless the hacker makes up a bogus
revision number, which is a dead giveaway.  Second, even though a well done
hack might go undetected by most, all it takes is one person to spot it, and
word will start to circulate amongst sysops that hacked versions exist and
should be watched out for.  There's even an electronic publication (The Hack
Report) that circulates amongst BBSes dedicated exclusively for this purpose.

I'm aware that a "mere" 99% or 99.99% safety level is inadequate for a
serious cypherpunk.  But I think it's quite adequate for most people, and
it's certainly no reason to slam all BBSes as being unsafe and inadequate.

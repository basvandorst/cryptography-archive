If you cheat.  
I contructed a closed-form expression for the n'th prime --
unfortunately, it involved a constant which was essentially a table of
primes.  This constant was a constructed as a binary fraction, with
each prime allowed a bitfield one wider than the last.  As subsequent
primes cannot more than double, this is safe.  You can take primes
back out with a messy thing involving powers of two, flooring, and
cancelling.  The powers of two would not force an implementation to be
exponential in time or space, because they are just used to scale the
constant, and need not be treated generally.  Of course, nobody would
ever implement this.

As to the real question... who knows?  It certainly seems unlikely,
but would it break anything?

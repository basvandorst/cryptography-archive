This is a (mild) concern of mine too; while I'm not convinced that
breaking DES is trivial or even easy, I'd like to see RIPEM have a
stronger symmetric cipher.  Unfortunately, the PEM standard doesn't
include a stronger cipher, and from what I've heard of the ideas the
Working Group has it's unlikely to be added.  So RIPEM can either try
to make up its own standard for something like triple-DES or IDEA or
whatever in advance of the PEM WG, or decide to wait.  I understand
the latter is what's being done for now.

But I would be very surprised if the NSA or PKP suddenly changed their
tune about RIPEM if it were modified in this way.  Besides, DES can't
be *too* trivial to break, as it's still on the export-restricted
list...

   With respect, I don't think the novices out there really care about
whether a way of bootstrapping verification of PGP is available.  They're
perfectly content to just download whatever they find and use it.  If there
were a 1 in 1000 chance of catching a nasty virus from a file, they might be
concerned.  But if 1 in 1000 copies of PGP were compromised, I don't think
they'd care much.  (If a hacked version became as widely distributed as, say,
1 in 10, then I think someone would quickly spread information on how to
detect that specific hack, and people would use it.)  Even if the figure can
be pushed down as low as 1 in a million copies being compromised, I think an
experienced cypherpunk has to look upon the masses of PGP users as a
"partially compromised" group.  If you start exchanging messages with a
novice, you should take whatever steps you deem sufficient to verify that
they have a valid copy of PGP at that time.  Walk them through an adequate
verification process, or transfer them a copy of yours in a secure manner.

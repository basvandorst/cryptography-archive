Now think about that question.  Of course not.

Indeed, it is, in part, to prevent such secrets that patents are
granted.  Of course, there are conditions under which an inventor would
prefer trade secret protection to a patent.  

International export is one
of those conditions.  If an inventor feels that the government granting
the patent is not able to protect him, for example by treaty, he may
prefer trade secret.  Few governments are able to grant reliable patents
today; patent treaties are in little pieces all over the world floor.

If you feel that the value of your intellectual property relies upon
world wide use, then trade secret is the only way to go.  No one
understands that better than the inventors of RSA; their invention is
exploited everywhere in the world except in the one country that granted
them a patent.  The inventors of an invention more novel and less
obvious than the microchip are systematically and intentionally denied
the compensation that the founders intended.  Many who post to this list
seem to begrudge them any compensation at all.

Coca-Cola has always understood it.

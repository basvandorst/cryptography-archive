   Hmmm.  This still concerns me.  It seems unlikely that a handful of
cryptographers and mathematicians under non-disclosure agreement would
do a more complete job of examining the algorithm for weaknesses than
would widespread, open comment from mathematicians and cryptographers
all over the world.  Since you're not free to discuss the algorithm,
there's not likely to be a free exchange of ideas or questions about the
algorithm's strengths and weaknesses.
 
   On the other hand, RSA has clearly seen that a software patent on an
encryption algorithm doesn't keep it from being widely used.

   I believe these statements were mine, and I should probably reiterate that
I've never seen the RC2 and RC4 algorithms, never tried to hack through them,
etc.  My mistrust was based on three things:
  1.  The limitation of the key length to 40 bits (to allow export of the
      software.
  2.  The fact that RC2/RC4 are allowed to be exported at all.
  3.  The lack of availability of the algorithm for public comment.
 
   My objections still stand, and on that basis, I wouldn't feel too secure
using RC2 or RC4 for high-security data encryption.  However, I could be
entirely wrong.

   As I said above, they've seen how effective *that* is.  Check out the
ratio of sci.crypt posters advertising PGP keys vs. RIPEM keys.

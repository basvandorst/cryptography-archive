I have heard of both as well. 

E(K1,D(K2,E(K1,x))) [I believe] was proposed early on as an improvement on 
single DES.  3 hardware chips can be wired to do that in a stream.  The 
advantage touted was that if K1=K2, then the three act like 1 -- so that 
device could interoperate with older, single-chip devices. 

E(K1,D(K2,E(K3,x))) has the same characteristic, if I1=K2=K3. 

When I think of triple DES, I advocate 

     E(K1,T(K2,E(K3,T(K4,E(K5,COMPRESS(x)))))) 

usually written as: 

     compress|des|tran|des|tran|des 

where tran transposes a stream in blocks up to 8KB in length (in one posted 
implementation).  Needless to say, this method makes no attempt to 
interoperate with single level DES.  Since this is intended for a S/W 
implementation, there's no need to be clever about interoperating.  If you 
get a message from someone with one-layer DES, you decrypt it with 
one-layer of DES. 


IMHO, it's time to note the original proposal, note the reasons for it 
and label it -- but not be considered bound by it.

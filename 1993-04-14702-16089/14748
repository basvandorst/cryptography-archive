You know, after I posted where I actually keep my copy of PGP2.2 yesterday,
I expected to come home and see such a scean. :)

Instead it was quiet and there were no strange black cars about. I went
inside and logged in and was not desterbed. I slept very well last night
too. *smile*

So, as I am so close to RWC, I would have imagined that they (any type
of bad guy you fancy) would have been at my door if they were really
serious about persuing the whole issue of patent infringement. As is,
it seems to be pretty much a non-issue.

So I will continue to enjoy the pleasures of PGP with no fear of being
attacted or punished.

There!

   possible solution: run chkdsk/f often to get ris of any extra sectors. 
   then run "diskopt" or a similar disk manager/ de-fragmenter.

   question: will this remove all those chunks of data?

No.  You are not guaranteed that all the data on the disk will be
removed.  In fact, even the best methods of over-writing will not
guarantee it, because of head shifts, etc.

If you really want to make sure that the data is off the disk, I
suggest doing one of a couple of things:
	1) Find a 20+ Tesla electromagnet and have your disk on in
the next time it gets powered up,
	2) Open it up and introduce your platters to a paper shredder,
	3) Don't put it on a hard drive -- use a floppy, which is
disposable.

I hope this helps...  There are probably other solutions, but this is
what comes to mind right now...

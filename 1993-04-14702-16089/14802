This suggests a new PC security product design approach - first fill the hard
drive with 50% random files and 50% files encrypted under a number of known 
keys. Then whenever a new secret file is created, you delete a random file and
replace it with real encrypted data. New non-secret files are encrypted under
a known key.

The result is that you can decrypt exactly 50% of the disk, and the feds can 
never prove that you have any secret files at all (though you might for prudence' 
sake have a few relatively innocuous `secret' files such as soft porn or gaming 
systems, in case they start to pull out your toenails).

Once there is a product (even a freeware one), it all becomes a lot easier, as 
you don't have to explain why you spent 100 hours writing the thing. Better 
still if the product does something else useful too such as word processing or
email. Better still if the encrypted files (of both types) are kept in a hidden
partition, where the average policeman would never look in the first place.

There are still countries where human rights are a bit of a joke, and these
countries would almost certainly use rubber-hose cryptanalysis rather than due
process (let alone parallel keysearch machines). 

So this could be quite a worthwhile project.

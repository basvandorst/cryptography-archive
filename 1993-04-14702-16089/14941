Why?  With all due respect to its authors, there are some people (myself
included) who see MIME as merely a stopgap solution.  Multimedia technology is
evolving rapidly.  Certain commercial software vendors with considerable
investment in multimedia R&D, and little short-term interest in encryption,
are pushing their own object-embedded MUAs and a different philosophical
approach to presentation.  I'm not trying to take sides here, it's just a fact
of industry.  I don't understand why the encryption issues have to be bundled
into MIME at this stage.  Would that mean that MIME, or its descendant, will
no longer be free?

And we're certainly not going to see MIME-level support in news anytime soon.
Encryption should be doable if/when the license issues get sorted out.

Feel free to set followup, I don't know where this thread belongs.

	If Public Key Partners did not exist, NSA would have to invent
	them.  If you believe, as I do, that NSA has a vested interest
	in resisting all non-NSA-controlled use of cryptography, then
	it is useful to them to have a limited number of choke points
	at which to exercise control. 

I've heard this suggested before, 'half-in-fun but half-in-earnest' as
we say up north..., but...

	I think that the existence of such an agreement is not unlikely
	and that its existence would account for a great deal of 
	otherwise inexplicable behavior.  In the absence of such an
	agreement, no one, least of all RSA, has been able to provide
	a satisfying explaination for the fact that RIPEM, which
	uses RSAREF, is readily licensed, while PGP, which does not, is
	not.

This is where your argument falls down.  Unless RIPEM requires registration
of the secret key, or is deliberately broken in some way that the NSA can
easily crack, it appears to break the purported NSA stranglehold on
strong crypto.  Why would they let even *one* worm out the can? - that's
all it needs to defeat them entirely.

Oh shit - I've just realised... RIPEM uses DES as its real cypher, doesn't
it?  In which case it *IS* broken, because the RSA key-exchange stuff is
just icing on the cake, if you can feed the DES code into a DES-engine.

OK, point taken.  What you say is certainly plausible.

I have an equally ignorant addendum.  Are the physics of chip layout
such that there is a vlsi analog to the computational complexity that
ensures that software encryption techniques are "unbreakable?"  That
is, could someone wishing to keep secret the hardware design simply
use enough gates/real estate in a complex manner to prevent a reverse
engineer from succeeding?

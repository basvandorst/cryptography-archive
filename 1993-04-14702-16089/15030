I understand digital signatures fine, the problem was that I
didn't quote enough in my post to give the full context.

The problem was a threadlet on alt.fan.john-palmer about how
could the real John Palmer show that his postings were his, and
not allowing the imposters to claim the same.  Digital
signatures would be fine, but there needs to be some
certification mechanism in place, or how can you tell which
public key belongs to the _real_ John Palmer?  I guess I wasn't
clear enough in my post that this linking was what I was
addressing.

Well, none of that has been answered yet. But presumably the time from there
busting the door down to the time of the shooting (apparently established
via either video or audio tape) was so brief (less than 5 seconds if I remember
correctly) that there is doubt that anybody could reasonably have made a
rational response. Subsequent reports revealed that the Ventura Country
DA has questioned why there was a "bash in" warrant at all for a search
of the *grounds* for marijuana plants in cultivation. Also, initial reports
of the supposed spectrographic evidence turns out to be simply reporters
confusing the aerial survey with the test of a sniffer developed by JPL
and being used for the first time on this raid (i.e. it could not have been
input to the warrant). So the only basis for the warrant was an inconclusive
flyby (the observer said he couldn't be sure of *anything*) and an unidentified
informant. 

The Ventura County Star Free Press reports that the
Ventura County DA has stated that he now has incontravertable evidence
that the LASD deliberately obtained the warrant using false basis. Unfortunately,
juristictional issues may prevent Ventura from directly filing charges.

More will develop over the next few days, and I'll report events
as they unfurl.

Back to the original issue: Dorothy Denning originally claimed that the
new wiretap law would not result in abuse, because a warrant would always
be required. It's clear that warrants are easily obtained for all manner
of intrusions and thus don't really afford the protection Denning believes.
Thus making wiretaps technically trivial could indeed result in increased
abuses. At least now the govt faces some technical barriers (however small).

MIME-compliant software.  Currently, there aren't any MIME-compliant news
readers, but you can fake it by piping news articles of interest into the
"reference" MIME mailreader implementation, metamail.

A competently written MIME reader should fail gracefully in the absence of
a graphical environment.  Metamail, for instance, will say that it found a
GIF image in the message and ask if you wish to ignore it or save it in a 
separate file for later perusal.

It shouldn't, even if you're not running MIME-compliant software.  You
may get bored paging past the thousands of lines of MIME-encoded graphics,
but you can read the whole article.

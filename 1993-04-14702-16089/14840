And when erasing the unallocated space on a disk don't forget
the pieces of disk just beyond the end of active files that
were *not* erased when the last extension of the file
requested whatever is the standard block size on your file system.

For example, say you open a new file and write 1200 bytes of
data to it.  Also let's suppose that your file system allocates
a 1024 byte block when the previous block fills.  (On the
pc and mac this allocation unit varies as the size of the
volume).  You would then have 848 bytes reserved for your
new file but NOT overwritten by the new file's data.

And unless you have a very clever (and slow) disk-overwriting
utility, this gore of space will be a very pretty archive
of whatever was on the disk before.

The moral?  UNless you own a *very* clever disk eraser utility.
erase the unallocated blocks fully *before* creating a new file.

If anyone is interested, I can send them a freeware Macintosh
utility for overwriting the unallocated blocks on a volume
with a long period pseudo-random stream.  It is quite fast.

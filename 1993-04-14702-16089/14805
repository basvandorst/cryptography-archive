I think there is 900 a number in operation which offers this
service.  The purpose is to defeat caller ID.  I remember seeing
an interview with the lawyer who started it.  He said that records
were kept of where the calls actually came from, but that these
records would not be released without a court order.  I don't
remember the 900 phone number though (too expensive).

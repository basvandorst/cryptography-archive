Let me ask a nieve and stupid and flameworthy question for purely
rhetorical purposes.

Would police actions like this be _reduced_ if we gave them more
chances to tap phones and use electronic surveilance? After all,
the response here is "Hey, we suspect something. Let's go grab our
SWAT team and roll on in and look for drugs!" Perhaps easier electronic
surveilance might lead the officer to say, "Hey, we suspect something.
Let's go read all the email he's gotten for the last month. Whoa...
what's this NORML pamphlet on the nutritional requirements for cannibus?!"


Just wondering outloud...

That work was continued in several subsequent papers, and strongly
influenced the design of the LOKI cipher. The references for these 
works are appended below. The last couple of papers are also 
available on-line (as TRs) via the "Australian Defence Force Academy"
Gopher server, under "About ADFA/Computer Science/Technical Reports".

Several papers analysing LOKI have appeared in the last couple of
years, most recently at Auscrypt92, and will appear in the 
proceedings when published by Springer-Verlag.

I'm happy to answer any further questions on my work.

Regards
Lawrie Brown

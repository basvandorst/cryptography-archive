Lines: 16

Hello I hope someone here can help me a friend suggested that I post to this
group. I am interested in getting a general algorithm that outlines VCR plus
encryption and decryption methods. I have a copy of some PD code accomplishes
these tasks given the day, month, year, time ect but it is written rather
cryptically written itself. Therefore, I was hoping that someone might be
able to point me some source that might contain the more general algorithm.
All e-mail replies greatly appreciated.

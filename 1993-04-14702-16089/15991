   I was under the impression (from reading Denning's description of the
   Clipper's operation) that the same session key *is* used in both directions for
   encrypting the message text, but that each chip uses it's own key for
   encrypting the session key into the law-enforcement field.  So, you only
   need to know the U key for one of the phones involved to decrypt the
   messages in both directions.

Actually, her description didn't say.  The chip docs look like you
COULD do it either way, though you'd have to crank a lot of key setups
into it if you wanted to use different keys in each direction;
it's probably a lot more convenient to use the same key each way.
But with ~10Mb/s throughput, and < 64 kb/s per direction for voice,
the chip is mostly idle anyway; key setup probably doesn't bother you
at less than T1 speeds.

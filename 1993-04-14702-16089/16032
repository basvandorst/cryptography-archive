On a related note, my upright Armor Attack game apparently also makes a
fairly decent police-band jammer.  It works well enough that a couple of
plainclothes officers came to my door in my absence, asked some questions
of my then-roommates, and requested that we cease operating the game as
it was interfering with squad car radios.  (The machine was located on the
second floor of an old house on the corner of a busy intersection.)

For those who care, Armor Attack is an old vector graphic (as opposed to
raster) game, and the back was constantly off.

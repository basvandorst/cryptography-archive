I've since been contacted by a couple of people who should know,
and they both say that Simmons' departure from Sandia National Labs
had nothing to do with this paper.  In fact, he evidently wrote it
after leaving. 

Sorry for spreading a false rumor.

Still don't know who sent me and several other sci.crypter's
the paper (nor who sent the third grade Valentine).
But consensus seems to be that although somewhat interesting, this paper
doesn't warrant the cloak-and-dagger treatment it has gotten.

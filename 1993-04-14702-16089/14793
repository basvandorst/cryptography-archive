	The way I make up passwords or pass phrases is to create a jumble of
letters and numbers from say, AD&D character stats, titles of books, CD's,
software programs, whatever you think of.  Don't use real words in any 
combination, because the Bad Guys will break it using a dictionary attack.

Example password:

	I take the PC game X-Wing, and look through the manuals for some
jumble of numbers and letters.  I look in the Farlander Papers and see the
specifications for the X-Wing.  The speed rating is 100 MGLT, the model number
is T-65C A2, and the sensor system is the Fabritech ANS-5d.  From this great 
password material, I get the pass phrase:
	100MGLT T-65Ca2Fabritech ANS-5d
If you forget this pass phrase, just retrace the steps you used in putting
the pass phrase together.  To all the password crackers, good luck, this one
will take a while.  (by the way, password crackers, do you think me to use the
example here or anywhere else?, I think not.)

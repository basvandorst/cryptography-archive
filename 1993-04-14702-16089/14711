	That would be Shumuel Peleg and Azriel Rosenfeld, "Breaking
Substitution Ciphers Using a Relaxation Algorithm," CACM, Vol 22, Num
11 (November 1979).

	Keep in mind that this is an AI paper, not a cryptography paper.
I don't think that the simple relaxation scheme they use has any chance against
a properly constructed (some-term-I-can't-remember-offhand) cipher, where
each plaintext letter can correspond to several ciphertext symbols.  With
the proper care, one can make such a cipher whose ciphertext symbols all
have equal probability of occurrence.  This symmetry doesn't give anything
for the relaxation scheme to gnaw against.

	Not, of course, that such ciphers are unbreakable.  :-)

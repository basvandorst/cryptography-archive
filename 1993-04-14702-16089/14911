That made me think of a rather silly hiding technique that just might work:

Write a minimal text-editor or spreadsheet program -- something barely able
to do something useful, but with an external reference to an (currently)
undefined variable.  Then write an encryption algorithm that spits out
code to produce a data record with the encrypted data, with that encrypted
data under the external reference.

Link your program and the encrypted data... and you have a runnable 
executable file which just happens to contain encrypted data as well.
Obviously, if you have a directory with 100 copies of the same text editor
in it people will be suspicious, but they may not be if the files are
scattered across a large file system. 

If someone demands you decrypt the encrypted data (as if they would ever
find it!) you can look innocent and suggest they call Microsoft, Borland,
etc.

To be really cute, your wrapper could be a _compiler_ -- and you could
claim the encrypted data is a bug you haven't been able to track down!

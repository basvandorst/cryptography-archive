I showed Jonathan Eifrig's posting to Steve Crocker.  Steve is the
the Security Area director for the IETF, and the Vice President of
TIS.  Thus, while he's clearly not unbiased, he's also very knowledgeable
about the subject.  Here's his reply to me, posted with permission.

I've now had a chance to read Eifrig's note.  It contains a number of
implied assertions which are wrong or which assume the worst possible
interpretation.  Rather than take the time to construct a careful
response to this stuff, I'd prefer to concentrate on getting PEM out
the door as widely as possible.

If you want to spend time on this, I recommend separating the
discussion into the following parts:

o The Internet PEM specs.  These are now published as RFCs 1421 thru
  1424.  Anyone is welcome to implement these, and the specs are
  available free of charge.  Most countries control the export of
  cryptographic systems, and some countries, e.g. France, control the
  use of cryptography within the country.

o The RSA patent and license.  The patent applies only within the U.S.
  (and Canada, I guess).  RSA and PKP have promised to provide access
  to the technology on reasonable terms.  There is ample evidence they
  are doing so.

o RSAREF.  This is an RSA Data Security Inc. product.  It's aimed at
  non-commercial use.  Although there are some limitation on the use
  of the code, RSADSI is also accepting requests to use the same code
  in other ways, including getting to layers below the published
  interface.

o TIS/PEM.  TIS is developing and distributing TIS/PEM.  It's
  available free of charge on a non-commercial basis.  In addition to
  the information we have provided before, we are actively revising
  TIS/PEM to open it up for much broader use.  We presented some ideas
  at the PEM WG meeting this past week which include opening up both
  the naming and trust hierarchy to accept other models as well.  More
  on this later.

o Certificates.  The Internet Certificate hierarchy involves some
  costs.  So far, RSADSI and TIS have announced they plan to provide
  this service.  Other PCAs will come into existence too, particularly
  in other countries.  Use of TIS/PEM is independent of use of PCA
  services.  (For the test period under way, we have been sigining
  people up under our PCA because neither the ISoC root nor any other
  PCA is yet in service.  All of this is free so far.)

I'm in agreement that widespread use of PEM depends on providing this
capability with the least possible hindrance.  We, and others, are
working hard on this.  It's slow and expensive, but it's coming.

As a separate matter, there is great urgency to merge PEM and MIME.
In some ways, this is at least as important as the free availability
of the software.

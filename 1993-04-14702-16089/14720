Thanks.  I should point out that the upper bound you mention
is of the form   x^(1-e(x))  where  e(x)--->0, which certainly
contradicts my earlier statement that pseudoprimes were proved
scarcer than perfect squares (as does the conjecture which 
Robert Silverman mentioned, that the density of Carmichaels is
x^(1-epsilon)). I'll look up the precise result and post it shortly.

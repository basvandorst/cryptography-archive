I don't think it's a good idea to ask BATF about anything - it might
attract attention to you and they might decide they want to do a
search in your home to check whether you're paying the proper taxes
for your PGP weaponry.  It might be bad for neighbour relationships to
have black unmarked choppers hovering above the house and tanks
rolling on the lawn, not to mention that the noise from the machine
guns might ruin your neighbour's sleep.

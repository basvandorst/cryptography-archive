As far as I can tell the only difference is in how long the records are
kept.  In the US the duration is usually about a year, and it varies from
state to state.

This is surprising; I had been led to believe that privacy laws are
stronger in the Netherlands because of unpleasant historical precedents
(meticulous birth records turned over the Nazis, etc).  For example, there
are no national ID numbers or unofficial versions thereof like the SSN. 
Can anyone in NL confirm or deny this?

Here is another question for our European correspondents: I am also told
that in Austria, the phone company does not keep calling records beyond
what is necessary for sending bills, and does not itemize the calls on
phone bills. The explanation given was that the customers lose some 
ability to dispute the bill, but gain some privacy through the more limited
dissemination of personal information.  Is this correct?  Is there any
published information on data privacy in different countries?

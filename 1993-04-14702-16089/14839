Pardon me, but isn't this very illegal?  I was under the impression that a
warrent *is* needed to get this information out of the phone company in
order to protect people's privacy.  A local (Worcester, MA) police officer I
spoke with only a couple of nights ago told me that they usually only
subpeona the phone companies records in *extreme* conditions because it's so
much of a hassle.  

If it is legal, please tell me how I can get this information, because I
would very much like to know who placed an obscene and potentially threating
phone call to my fiance the other night.

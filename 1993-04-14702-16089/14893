Not exactly.  "diff" techniques work just as well against binary or
disassembled binary.  In some ways it is better than source, because
you can pinpoint what has changed without being distracted by variable
renaming, indentation changes, comments, and non-functional changes.
So binary may be not just a bit easier to work with, but many bits easier.

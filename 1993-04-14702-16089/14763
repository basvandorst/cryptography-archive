Pardon me if this is a silly question.

Couldn't someone outside the US post PGP to the alt.security.pgp group in 
much the same manner as programs are posted to the binary groups?

If a reputable person were to post it with the uudecodable portion as 
plain text and with the posting verifiable by users who already have 
older versions of PGP then anyone who can get news could get the updates
very promptly. The BBS's that don't get news could be seeded that much 
more easily.

Would this decrease or increase the overall affect on net bandwidth?
I mean is it better to have many, many people ftp'ing PGP from well 
known ftp sites or have many, many people getting it through news?
I wouldn't propose that PGP not be made available through ftp. I'm just 
thinking of alternatives.

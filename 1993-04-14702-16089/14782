You are wrong. :-)  If you implement IDEA in free software or as shareware,
the nice chaps at Ascom Tech AG don't require you to pay them a penny.

If you want to use IDEA in commercial software, they'll sell you a source
code license for an IDEA implementation, and give you permission to use it in
as many products as you like.  Check with them for precise details and
licensing fees, but as I recall it's likely to be cheaper to buy the IDEA
license than to pay someone to re-implement DES.

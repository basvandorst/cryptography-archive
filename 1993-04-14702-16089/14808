Cheezebox was both a device & a person. He built a call diverter for
the Mafia's numbers operations. The only handy box to put it in
was......

He wrote a book about his experiences, & I'm pretty sure that the book
title was _Cheezebox_, too. One point germaine to this topic - he was
more afraid of the local vice squads then the mob. Seems his device
meant they no longer got their payoffs for 'overlooking' the numbers
storefronts, because they didn't know where they were. Thus they were
out to do him in, so they could get back on the payroll....

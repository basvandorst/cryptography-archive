Although this isn't, strictly speaking, a cryptography question, it's
sufficiently related that I don't feel too bad about posting it here.
(Especially considering all the heat D. Denning has been taking lately
over this very issue.)

Is anyone aware of any existing work on risks/costs/benefits of the FBI's
proposal to require hardware manufacturers to build into their hardware
entry points for court-authorized data taps?  For example, a phone switch
maker would be required to design the switch such that the telephone
company, when presented with a legal court order, would be able to tap off
a given line and send the bits to some FBI listening post.  It wouldn't
matter what was on the phone line -- voice, video, encrypted data, etc.

I am looking for any existing framework on which I can base an analysis
of the cost vs. gain for such a proposal.  It is my understanding that
papers on this topic are few and far between.  I would be willing to 
work with some bizarre assumptions (e.g. the cost of a murder vs. the
benefit of preventing the murder vs. the cost/gain of trying and convicting
the murderer, etc. etc.).

Any help or pointers would be greatly appreciated.

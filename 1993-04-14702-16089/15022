|What MIME does, precisely, is to enhance the SMTP transport to allow sending
|object data types of arbitrary format, with some type descriptor included to
|allow the receiving end to identify the object.

More precisely, it enhances the RFC821 message format, not the SMTP
transport.

|Such objects may be embedded
|(one level only) in the message or included as attachments.

I'm afraid I don't understand what you mean by ``one level only''.
MIME multipart contents may include other multipart contents, so
messages may be structured many levels deep; MIME messages are not
``flat''.

|Before we can have a global multimedia e-mail solution, there must be some
|definition of a minimum service level, and MIME does not provide for this
|(yet).

True, and an overabundance of content types is one thing I have always
been worried about, because it makes interoperability increasingly
difficult.  As more and more people try to use MIME, I expect one of
two things will happen:

1. MIME will fail, and we'll know more for the next attempt, or (I
   hope)

2. Other RFCs will come which specify additional semantics for MIME
   messages, new ``standard'' models for multimedia exchange, lists of
   content types considered minimal for reasonable implementations to
   support, etc. all based on the MIME spec.

You seem to want to have already completed the second option, which I
don't think is reasonable at this stage.

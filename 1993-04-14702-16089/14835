   Well, you've got me there. Everybody has to take some things on trust :)
   I, for example, trust others who tell me the Earth is round. I've never
   checked it myself. I'd love to, but nobody wants to provide the facilities.

If your financial situation is really dire, I will very happily provide
facilities at my own expense.  They consist of a pencil, notebook
and a few pages of simple trigonometry and astronomy.   8-)

Just one example: Over the course of a month or two, look at the shape
of the lit portion of the moon, and estimate the angle between it and
the sun.  Deduce that the moon is, to a good approximation, spherical.
*If* you assume that the earth and the moon are not fundamentally
different in character, this suggests that the earth is also spherical.

Wait until the next lunar eclipse; deduce that at this time the sun,
earth and moon are in a straight line and that, therefore, the shadow of
the earth is falling on the moon.  The earth's shadow is observed to be
circular.  Good evidence, (not proof I'll admit) that the earth is
probably spherical to a good approximation.  Repeat this several times
(OK, it'll take a decade or so) and observe that the shadow is *always*
circular, irrespective of the time of year or time of day.  Pretty good
evidence in my view.  (I assume you're prepared to set up a Foucault
pendulum to test the hypothesis that the earth rotates.  Your
observations of the motions of the Moon should have told you by now that
the Sun and moon move with respect to the stars.)

There are several other classical tests for the roundness of the earth
which require only observation and simple mathematics.

Not much to do with cryptography, I confess.  Sorry.

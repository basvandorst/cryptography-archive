I've just had a rather depressing thought.  Next year's harrassment
technique for anyone who pisses off any overpowerful authority will be:

'hey - you've got stolen programs/kiddy porn/drug info on your computer'

"don't be stupid, what a ridiculous idea"

'but you've got a crypto program on your machine, and WE'VE HAD A TIP OFF'

"there's *nothing* illegal in my files.  I just don't like you gits
reading my personal mail"

'well, give us your crypto key and let us look'

"bugger off, it's mine, my data is private, and I've done nothing wrong"

'we got the judge to issue a subpoena - you have to tell us'

"nope. its a matter of principle"

'Ok - 6 months for contempt of court.  And if you are still in
contempt at the end of six months and still don't hand over your
crypto key, it's back inside for another six months, and again
and again until you rot'

Sound possible?

   On further reflection, it would probably be simpler to use something
like the info-zip source code,  since it provides the rudimentary capa-
bility of creating, deleting, listing files.   Stub in another module
to handle all of the disk i/o, encryption, etc.;  toggle the stealth
mode through a hot-key sequence.  This program could be left on your
disk and would look totally innocent.

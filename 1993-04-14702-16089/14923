For anybody who knows anything about France, it is obvious that the defeat
of the socialist party has a single cause: its inability to give employment
to poeple.  ( Note that I do not blame them for it: it was and still is
an unpossible task ). These wiretap affairs are considered of little
importance in the french opinion, when compared with the employment problem.

As for President Mitterand, given his age and state of health, it is VERY
unlikely that he could again be a candidate for his current function...

Generally speaking, I would rather think that the fight agains organized
crime or terrorism IS important. For US poeple, who have not know any
long period of terrorism as Europeans, just think (for some seconds)
	1/ to the 5 poor guys in the W.T.C.
	2/ to the 10000 others if, instead of a small group of fanatics, the
	   bomb had been laid by a well-organised group of fanatics...

In any case, if we want to be safe in our countries, there must exist poeple
who can stop the action of the "bad guys"; i.e. the policemen. These poeple
must have rights that the layman does not have if we want them to be efficient.
The right to wire-tap (under control of a judge) is one of these rights. I think
that our safety in our lives is worth a reduction of the privacy. One should be
reasonnable: in the traffic of millions of poeple, it is not possible to spy
everybody: only SOME poeple are tapped, who usually are the ones who cry the
loudest for privacy! (or cheat honest poeple to make them protest against
privacy violations which will never occur FOR THEM...)

Hmmm again.  Now if I were encrypting a whole disk, I wouldn't use PGP,
since there's no point in using a public key.

What I'd do instead is encrypt the disk with a random secret key X,
then encrypt X with my password (call this encrypted key "Y"), and
store Y on the disk.  Then, I'd rig my software to *ERASE Y FROM THE
DISK* if I hit a hotkey combination (on hearing my door being broken
down), or if the encrypted partition is accessed and the correct
password isn't supplied within 5 seconds.  Erasing Y would take only
a few milliseconds but would unrecovorably trash all the information
on the disk.

Of course, I'd never be able to get the information back either
(assuming the backups are all also encrypted with X), so I'd have to
really be sure that the data was better off being destroyed than
falling into the wrong hands.  Naturally I'd never cheat by writing
down the random key X on a buried piece of paper (or a bathroom wall
in a distant town), because then I'd have to tell them that this copy
of X existed and where it was.  (Sure...).

Here's Dorothy's own response, as sent to Phil Karn:

Phil,


        But in your own textbook you wrote:


>From Dorothy Denning, CRYPTOGRAPHY AND DATA SECURITY, Addison-Wesley
        1982,1983, page 8:


        "Cryptosystems must satisfy three general requirements:


        [...]


        "3. The security of the system should depend only on the secrecy
of the keys and not on the secrecy of algorithms E [enciphering] or D
        [deciphering]."


        Are you renouncing this principle?


        Phil


Two points:


1. Principle (3) does not say that you should make your algorithm public.
   If the key has 80 bits of uncertainty and the algorithm itself
   represents maybe thousands of bits of uncertainty, aren't you
   better off with that additional secrecy?  The STU-III's use a
   classified algorithm.  I haven't heard of anyone breaking it.


2.  Principle (3) assumes that the problem domain is message secrecy and
    authenticity.  The Clipper Chip is designed to do more than that,
    namely provide law enforcement access.  This introduces new areas
    of potential vulnerability and changes the problem domain
    somewhat.  Hence the requirements may be somewhat different.  I did
    not consider the law enforcement issues when I wrote my book.


Dorothy
P.S.  You may share this response if you want.

	I've happened across these, and dome go by the tradename Cyalume, 
made by American Cyanamid.  I've used these light-sticks as secondary and 
support lighting underwater, and I would also be very interested to know 
the chemical basis behind this luminescence.  Also, knowing this, perhaps 
there would be a way of decreasing the entropy of this system by separating 
the two chemicals, hence having some way of recharging these chemical 
lights.

	My second concern about these chem lights is their toxicity.  I 
realize that the package says that the lights are 'non-toxic.'  However, 
this might mean 'non-toxic to humans' rather than 'non-toxic to aquatic 
plants or animals.'  I can look up the MSDS for the individual chemicals if 
someone would post them to this group.

	Many thanks,

RIPEM does perform signatures per PEM.  I think you're remembering
RPEM, which did not do so (because it used a public key cipher which
did not allow encrypting stuff with your private key without giving
your private key away.)  It's discussed briefly in the RIPEM FAQ.

I do not believe TIPEM was a typo.  I've heard of it before, though I
don't know much about it.

What you have, however, is not a shell script.  It's a csh abomination instead.

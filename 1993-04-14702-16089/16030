Seems to me that there could be both a back door and key escrow, with the
key escrow being used in exactly this way -- to lull the public into
believing there is not a back door.  Useful for maintaining the appearance
of security where none really is.  Since the algorithm is secret, who can
prove there isn't a back door?  A panel of "experts?"  Hah!  Not until the
algorithm is in public view will I believe there is no back door.

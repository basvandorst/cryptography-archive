Well, this subject has already been covered adequately, but it has been
a while since I posted my standard response to "how do these things work?"
question.  This is a fairly technical discussion requiring at least
introductory Organic Chemistry knowlege.

A quick summary for those in a hurry:  No, you can't make these at home.
You CAN probably make Luminol solutions that are fun, but these don't glow
nearly as long or nearly so brightly.  I didn't include any Luminol info
in this post.

Here is my standard response...

Luminol, while fun, is NOT what is used in commercial lightsticks.  Luminol
just doesn't last long enough.

All of the material below is taken from a chemical demonstrations book for
which, unfortunately, I do not have the bibliographic information.  It was
titled something like "Chemical Demonstrations for Instructors", and was a
four-volume set.

Anyway, on to the meat of the matter.

The oxidant is hydrogen peroxide contained in a phthalic ester solvent.  The
concentration is very low, less than 0.5%.  The fluorescing solution consists
of a phenyl oxalate ester and a fluorescent dye.  The dye used is 9,10-bis-
(phenylethynyl)anthracene (for green) or 9,10-diphyenylanthracene (for blue).

Here is the reaction sequence:

1)  (Ph)-O-CO-CO-O-(Ph) + H2O2 --> (Ph)-O-CO-CO-O-OH + (Ph)-OH

2)          (Ph)-O-CO-CO-O-OH  -->  O-O
                                    | |    +  (Ph)-OH
                                   OC-CO

3)                 C2O4 + Dye  --> Dye* + 2CO2

4)                        Dye* --> Dye + hv

In 1) The hydrogen peroxide oxidizes the phenyl oxalate ester to a peroxyacid
ester and phenol.  The unstable peroxyacid ester decomposes to the cyclic
peroxy compound and more phenol in step 2).  The cyclic peroxy compound is
again unstable and gives off energy to the dye as it decomposes to the very
stable carbon dioxide.  The dye then radiates this energy as light.

So far as I know the only way to get the dyes needed is to synthesize them
yourself.  If anyone knows otherwise, please let me know!

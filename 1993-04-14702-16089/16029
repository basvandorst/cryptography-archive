Recently I've heard/seen conflicting opinions as to whether it is legal
to export from the U.S. ciphertext which the U.S. govt. can't decipher.
It's said that Western Union won't accept coded telegrams (presumably
to prevent one from cabling Khadaffi with the latest data on U.S.
plutonium production).  Can anyone cite any U.S. law that restricts
sending encrypted data overseas?

I'd also be interested to know which countries restrict the transmission
of non-govt-decipherable ciphertext (a) internally and (b) across their
borders.

      This has the potential for obstruction as well.  Even worse, refusal to 
      turn over pass information to the court might be considered contempt....
      I suppose it depends on whether the judge believes you forgot it or not....

The real value of encryption isn't what happens *after* you get to court -
it's keeping your information private *until* you get to court,
by which time you've got your lawyer, the ACLU, and Mike Godwin (:-)
helping you, and you can discuss with the judge whether the warrant
was valid, which information they *might* be able to force out of you,
which information isn't relevant, whether there's still a 4th or 5th Amendment, 
and when you'll be able to get your equipment back.

Without it, the cops have your hardware, and they can do whatever they
want with the information, because you're not a free citizen,
you're a suspected drug dealing child pornographer thieving member of
the Legion of Gloom and Doom evil hacker conspiracy,
every description of kermit on your system is obviously burglar's tools,
and everybody whose name is on your system is a co-conspirator.

With encryption, you might even be innocent until proven guilty,
and you've got some control over the level of bogosity.

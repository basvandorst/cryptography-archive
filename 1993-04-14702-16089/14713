The mechanism that you describe is known as an extended hand shake.  It 
is based upon a shared secret, expressed in terms of the photos that you
submit.  It resists playback attacks by altering the form of the challenge
(photos) and the response (secret; which of the challenge photo is from the
set of the secret.)  It resists guessing and exhaustive attacks by 
disclosing only part of the secret (one photo from the set) with each
challenge.  

The fact that the challenge is in the form of an image exploits the human
brains ability to store and recognize images, but requires high
bandwidth.  However, the fact that the response is a digit, negates
most of the security that might arise from this.

In fact, security is not raised, but lowered, by extending the handshake
further, since more of the secret would be disclosed with each
additional challenge and response.

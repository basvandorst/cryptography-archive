While solving monoalphabetic substitution ciphers I did letter, digraph, trigraph, etc frequency
counts. Considering the problem in general (ie not necessarily ASCII English plaintext) it seemed
that some general calculation of frequency is needed. This feels very DSP/FFTish to me; is there
a package that does this?

In automated cryptanalysis it seems that having a library of frequency signatures of different
kinds of plaintext (ASCII English, Russian, Japanese; GIF, NDL, etc) would be necessary to
flag possible solutions; the equivalent of solving a substitution cipher with a NULL key.

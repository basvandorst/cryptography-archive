Subject: one-time pad security
Lines: 36

I am writing a simple one-time pad encryption program, just for fun, and was
curious about a few things:

1) Is the one-time pad as secure/more secure/less secure as DES or RSA?
(Provided, of course, the pad is kept secret, etc) How does it stand up
mathematically to attacks?


2) Does the algorithm used in producing ciphertext make any security
difference with a O-T-P?  ie, if you XOR the bytes in the plaintext by the
pad, or simply add the bytes together, or use plaintextbyte XOR (NOT
PADBYTE) etc - does this make any difference from a cryptanalytical point of
view?

I know a O-T-P is secure only if the pad is used one time.  But, how random
does this pad have to be, or does it matter if it's at all random, security
wise?

Lastly, is there anything else of great importance I should know when using
and implementing a one-time-pad system?  I'm doing this more for myself than
for anything, and will most likely use this on top of DES or RSA encrypted
files, as a last layer of protection.  I am just wondering how much added
protection it will give, and if it's secure enough to be used standalone.

I would appreciate any replies in E-mail.  Thanks!

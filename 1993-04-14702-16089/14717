Nor is this an isolated incident. In Poway, California (just NE of San
Diego) a very similar thing happened last year. An innocent man's home
was invaded by drug agents after midnight with a no-knock warrant. He
quite reasonably believed his home was being invaded and he tried to defend
himself. He was shot, but unlike the Ventura case, he survived to sue the
pants off the agents. I hope he wins big.

Oh yeah, the "probable case" for the warrant in this case consisted
solely of a claim from an informant already known to be unreliable.
Under pressure to "produce", he simply picked a house at random and
said it housed a drug dealing operation.

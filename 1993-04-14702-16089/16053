Before this leads to another out-of-hand thread, let me be more precise.

Those who know say Clipper has no back door. The President says (one assumes
on the basis of being told) that Clipper has no back door.

Those who claim it does are not in a position to know. The best they can do
is to assert that the government is lying and impute motives so to do.

It beggars credibility to suggest that the NSA would deliberately expose the
President to be caught lying on such a sensitive issue. It further beggars
credibility to suggest that the elaborate key escrow scheme, with its costs
and inconveniences, as well as its political disadvantages among some, is an
elaborate sham. Finally, it really beggars credibility that the NSA would
risk their reputation and that of the President on there being a back door
that a  blue-ribbon audit committee couldn't find.

Occam's razor suggests that the government could get the same result at
lesser risk by releasing Clipper, saying it has no back door, and saying
"take it or leave it" without any key escrow, if it indeed does have a back
door.

There's such a thing as carrying conspiracy theories beyond the bounds of
credibility.

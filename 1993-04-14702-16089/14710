About a year ago someone posted an article regarding a new book authored by 
Julia Van Duyn and possibly others relating to computers, release of personal 
information, etc..
I lost the information on the book, but have not been able to find any book
by her relating to computers published later than 1985.
If anyone remembers the name and other pertinent information on the book, could
you repost it.
Thanks,
Art Riedlinger

It seems to me that true security against law enforcement prying must be
the ability to permantly corrupt secret key data at a moments notice.
Perhaps PGP could be modified to accept a 'self destruct' pass at the
key pass phrase prompt.  Something that fries all the secret key data
immediately.  Of course this is easily detered by backup before examination
of your data by law enforcement.  The only other option is to design some 
software that will fry your secret key data if a simple and non obstusive
procedure is not followed.  Call it a panic button.  Maybe a system disk on
floppy that starts up a mass deletion applciation?  The old knock on the door
could be accompanied by booting this disk on the way to answer the bell eh?

If data is of prime importance, backup keys could be kept on disk in a
SEPERATE LOCATION, (Like 6ft under your lawn in a waterproof bag?)

The only real answer is to be able to destroy the data, weather or not 
you are present when the gestapo comes to take your system.
Don't sell law enforcement short when considering how to HIDE data, if
it was important enough to seize your system for, it's likely it will
be looked for pretty hard.

I'd love to hear some suggestions on automatic deletion applications.

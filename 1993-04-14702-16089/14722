There is much in the literature to support the idea that effective SIGINT
and other spying has reduced tension, at least between the US and the
former USSR.  In this case, two militarily equal powers were in a position
to anihilate each other and the rest of the world.  Spying allowed them to
realize that the apparently threatening other side wasn't really that
threatening (or really was, in the Cuban missle crisis case).

In the case of police forces of the USA (including the FBI) and citizens of
the USA, the situation is different.  The law enforcement agencies need to
remember that citizens have rights and LE desires are subordinate to those
rights.  Police actions are then reduced because the police remember (or
are reminded) that they can't get their way, no matter how much force they
can threaten.

To claim that the citizenry needs to be naked before law enforcement in
order to keep law enforcement from acting like bullies is to give in to
that bullying.

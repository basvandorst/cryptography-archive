A couple of quick corrections (these are obvious to readers of
comp.mail.mime, though I've nevertheless redirected followups there).

MIME does not have anything to do with SMTP transport; one of its
primary design goals was to enrich the definitions of message
content without affecting message transport.  Indeed, MIME
messages are transportable over unmodified SMTP channels, and
MIME contains explicit features to overcome SMTP limitations and
restrictions.  (MIME is also expected to be largely useable with
other transport mechanisms, although there are difficulties
having to do with EBCDIC networks.)

MIME *does* define a "minimum service level" of "commonly-
accepted object data types" which "must be recognized in order
for an application to be considered MIME-compliant;" that level
is just a little lower than W.C. Newell might like, as it
includes only text, not multimedia, which would be a bit
premature.

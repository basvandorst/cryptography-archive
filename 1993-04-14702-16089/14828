This is unfair.  Todd Arnold has included IBM's "official" version of the
story.  You are free to challenge the accuracy of the description and ask
for more information.  If you have good reasons to believe the description
is biased, by all means tell us.  You don't label somebody's writing biased
just because of his affiliation.

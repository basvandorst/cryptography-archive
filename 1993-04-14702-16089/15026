Thanks for the thought which, I admit, had not occurred to me. 

I had presumed that the universal export ban resulted from Laplink V's 
encryption of the file containing all security information (passwords, user's 
names, permissions etc.) was the reason for the ban. Given that the ban 
stipulated is on any exportation rather than on exportation to one or more 
specific markets, on balance, I think that the file encryption may be the 
acual cause. 

PC Tools 8 suffers a similar restriction where the encryption 
untility included (DES ECB?) is substituted in the international edition with
something less (PKZip's algorithm?). Will Apple's latest encryption utilities 
not be similarly be denied permission for general exportation from the US? 

Sad really.

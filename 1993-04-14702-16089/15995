I have a stupid question about the clipper chip.

I have been reading with much interest regarding the clipper chip and
its agorithms, keys, etc. and so fourth including the fact that the
design is classified.

My question is what is to prevent someone who has one of these chips
(from a cellphone or computer or whatever) from taking the chip to
a microelectronic facility with a decent scanning electron microscope and
other equipment that is used to testing and analysis of microcircuits 
and taking the darn thing abart and reverse engineer it?

There must be plenty of microelectronic facilities that are under 
relatively minimal security (such as universities) for someone to
try to reverse engineer one of these classified chips that the government
plans to put into the public's hands.

Am I missing something obvious here? What could have the government done
to address this possibility? Do they really care if it stays classified?

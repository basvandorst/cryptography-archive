So why were journalists' phones tapped?  Why were political opposition
leaders' phones tapped?  These aren't terrorists, they're just some
people who might have an interest in exposing the illegal or excessive
activities of the current government.

Not exactly a major threat to french society.  But definitely a threat
to the POLITICAL CAREERS of some of your top government officials.

Sure, I agree that sometimes a wiretap is necessary during the course
of an investigation, when *other evidence* of *criminal* activity
already provides enough justification for a warrant to issue.  But your
government was spying on its political rivals, not "terrorists."

If you don't see a problem with that, then you'd better hope you never
hold a view that the current government wishes you didn't...

As a little light relief away from the politicking and flames
wars, I pose the following problem.

	BUFDA GNPOX IHOQY TKVQM PMBYD AAEQZ

You are told only that it is in Playfair, that it was proposed as
a problem in the mid-1930's by a British army officer and was
solved by an American army private.


I came across this in a collection of papers published in
Cryptologia.  Sorry I can't give the full reference, but I forgot
to bring it in with me.

I solved it, but it took me a few hours, most of which was spent
writing a Playfair engine for my PC.  Cracking it with nothing
but pencil and paper looks very laborious, unless there are
tricks I'm not aware of (which is quite likely).

If you're familiar with this one, please don't post the plaintext
until others have had a chance to solve it.

Please do let me know if you succeed in solving it.


Paul

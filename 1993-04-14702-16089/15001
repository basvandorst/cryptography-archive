I recently upgraded a PC running MS-DOS 5.0 to run MS-DOS 6.0.
The PC in question also contained a 4MB Norton 6.0 Diskreet virtual
disk, with "DES" encryption.

Having always been a little leery of "on-the-fly" data compression
programs and having always been blessed with large hard drives, I
resisted loading the "DoubleSpace" (i.e., data compression) driver of
MS-DOS 6.0.  Until this morning.

With a fresh tape back-up in hand, I undertook the very time-intensive
task of running the dblspace program.  Thank God for back-ups.

Unless someone from Microsoft can tell me differently,  Diskreet disks
do not work with DOS 6 compression.  After "successfully" loading DOS 6,
which tried to self-abort around a dozen times, the Diskreet disk was
inaccessible.  I believe dblspace assigned a new virtual partition
letter to Diskreet, but it did not bother to imform me which letter that
was.  Attempts to access all drives a: - z: in search of Diskreet were
to no avail.  Attempting to run programs which had embedded access to
the Diskreet drive for data storage and retrieval resulted in a
a locked-up machine -- only a cold boot brought the PC to life.

Has anyone had a similar experience with DOS 6 and Diskreet?

       This focus on exactly which illegal acts took place when which
laws were in force is an irrelevant diversion from the facts.  The
1985 OTA study makes it clear that illegal wiretapping by Federal 
agencies has taken place under multiple adminstrations, by multiple
agencies, and despite repeated Congressional attempts to restrain it.

       I recommend reading that study, which I cited in my previous
posting.  It turns out that much wiretapping law grew out of Prohibition
(of alcoholic beverages), back in the 1920s.  The tradition of 
strict written restrictions on wiretapping by law enforcement coupled
with weak enforcement of those restrictions is an outgrowth of the
political battles between the "wets" and the "drys" of the Prohibition
era.  

       One striking point in that study is that a number of US states
totally prohibit wiretapping by state and local law enforcement, and
that does not seem to correlate significantly with state crime rates.
This is to be expected, because wiretapping is seldom useful in solving
crimes already committed.  It's primarily a tool used by law enforcement
against already-identified targets.  The targets change from time to
time with the political mood.  Labor unions were a major target in the
1930s; black leaders in the 1960s.  Communists were big in the 1920s
and again in the 1950s.  

       A big fraction of wiretapping activity, looked at decades after
the fact, looks dumb.  The historical case for law-enforcement wiretapping 
looks weak.  Yes, there's a big win once in a while.  But not often
enough to affect the measured risk of becoming a crime victim.

Glenn is laboring under the mistaken impression that what PKP *says* it
does, or what it has "agreed" to do, and what it *actually* does are the
same thing.  There are no "standard terms," at least none we've been
able to obtain in several years of negotiations with PKP.  We have in
the past received several documents called "standard license
agreements," but of course they have all been full of holes that PKP has
been unwilling to fill with reasonable numbers.

The terms for existing agreements with the biggies (Lotus, Microsoft,
Apple, etc.)  are, as far as we know, all secret.  If not, I'm sure
someone will post one of these agreements to this list and I'll retrack
my statement.  :-) This cloak of secrecy has allowed PKP to get whatever
they feel they can get away with, which is undoubtedly something just
short of what a law suit would cost the licensee.  I'll bet that no two
of these agreements are the same, but welcome evidence to the contary.

As far as I know, no small company (aside from Fischer, of course) has
been able to obtain a license on reasonable terms; actually there is
much evidence to support the belief that RSADSI would prefer to drive
you out of business (using various forms of intimidation) than grant you
a license--at least if you represent any sort of competition in the
public key arena.  Interesting, no?

You're dreaming if you think you can get anywhere by "just ask[ing] PKP"
for "standard terms." As far as I'm concerned, their recent RFC was
simply a smokescreen intended to mislead the highly gullible.

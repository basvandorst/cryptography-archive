Here is what RSA Data Security, Inc. says about RC2 in a marketing brief dated  
July 22, 1992.

"RC2 is a symetric block cipher that is suitable as a "drop-in" replacement for  
the DES algorithm. RC2 implementations are approximately twice as fast as DES  
while requiring only about half the memory space in comparable environments.   
RC2 has become extremely popular as a DES alternative because applications or  
hardware containing the DES algorithm have historically been nearly impossible  
to export due to U.S. State Department restrictions."

"...Unlike some popular algorithms, RC2 and Rc4 are immune to known  
cryptanalytic attacks, and their throughput speeds are independant of key  
size."

Never one to blindly trust a marketing brief, I asked the denizens of sci.crypt  
for their opinion of RC2.  I'd like to thank those who responded.

The following is a summary of the responses I received.  I have not indicated  
who said what.  Also, I do not claim that any of the responses are correct.   
Judge for yourself.  (NOTE:  The "--------"'s indicate a change in responder.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Is RC2 nearly twice as fast as DES in comparable environments?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Is RC2 encryption speed independent of key size, as RSA claims?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I would believe RSADSI's claims about speed versus DES.  Remember that DES was  
designed for hardware, not sofware.  There are parts of that algorithm that are  
a real pain to implement in software.  I also believe RSA that speed is  
independent of key size.  That's not hard to do, and I assume it pretty easy to  
verify (so RSADSI can't get away with lying).


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Is RC2, with 64 bit keys, more secure than DES?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The problem with RC2 (and RC4) is that the algorithms are secret.  No one
really knows how secure it is.  If you want some real opinions, buy a
product that already has RC2 installed, disassemble the source code (can't
be that hard), and post the algorithm on the net.  You'll get opinions.

As to RC2's security compared to DES, I have no idea.  It's possible.  Not
enough people have examined the algorithm to make an assessment.

--------

A couple of weeks ago I asked NSA whether just RSADSI, or both
NSA and RSADSI, want to keep the algorithm secret.  NSA told me that they
would be delighted to see the algorithm published, but that RSADSI wanted
to keep it a trade secret, presumably to protect their intellectual property.

Given the parties involved, extra disclaimers must apply.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just how easy is it to crack cyphertext encrypted with RC2 and 40-bit keys?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	The 40-bit keys are too short to keep anyone but your officemate
out of your files.  It has noting to do with RC2 vs. any other system; the
problem is that 2^40 is only 10^12.  A brute-force keyspace search through
10^12 keys is quite feasible.  You have to expect that an adversary could
check something like 10^6 to 10^8 keys per processor-hour; with a fully
loaded CM-5 (which has something like 10^6 processor-hours/day) he could
check the entire keyspace in something like 15 minutes to a day.

	40 bits is just about the edge of feasibility of brute-force attacks
on "moderate" levels of current hardware.

	What, did you think that NSA's export restriction of 40 bits or less
was just for yuks?  ;-)

--------

     The RC2 algorithm is unpublished.  Perhaps you could ask a representative
of RSA whether its remaining unpublished is one of the conditions of its
fast-track approval for export.  (My impression was that this *is* one of
the conditions of its pre-approval for export, but I am not certain.)  Since
it's unpublished, there is a chance that it's really a terribly weak algorithm.
It's even possible that with long keys, it has some weaknesses that RSA's
people aren't aware of.  At any rate, it's nothing I'd trust to protect
anything very confidential.

..if the alternative is putting in some sort of weak 
home-grown encryption scheme (ie, XORing the output from a simple random
number generator against the plaintext), RC2 is probably a better choice.
If you can, it would be nice if you'd note in the user documentation for
the product that RC2 is *not* high-security encryption.  Probably better
than PKZIP's encryption scheme, or WP51's, but nothing to use with really
valuable data.

--------

It is interesting to note in this regard that permission to export
PKZIP's encryption scheme has twice been denied by NSA.  Draw you own
conclusions.

The following is from the Sep 14, 1992 edition of "Answers To Frequently Asked  
Questions About Today's Cryptography" by Paul Fahn of RSA Laboratories.  This  
document can be ftp'ed from rsa.com:/pub/faq/faq.ps.Z

	"RC2 and RC4 are variable-key-size cipher functions designed by Ron  
Rivest and meant for fast bulk encryption.  They are alternatives to DES (see  
Question 5.1) that are as fast or faster than DES and are capable of being more  
secure than DES because of their ability to use long key sizes; they can also  
be less secure than DES if short key sizes are used."

	"RC2 is a variable-key-size symmetric block cipher and can serve as a  
drop-in replacement for DES, for example in export versions of products  
otherwise using DES.  RC2 is approximately twice as fast as DES, at least in  
software.  ... Both RC2 and RC4 are very compact in terms of code size.  Their  
speeds are independant of key size.  To date, they have not been implemented in  
hardware."

	...

	"RC2 and RC4 are proprietary algorithms of RSA Data Security Inc.   
Details about them have not been published (including by patenting) in order to  
maintain their special export status."

Hmm.

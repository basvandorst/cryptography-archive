It is apparently quite easy to get hold of a person's calling records
through the phone company.  Police (and some lawyers) are able to acquire
such information without any warrant or judicial supervision, whether or
not the target is suspected of specific crimes.  The surveillee is not
notified, and I can say from experience that such surveillance is used in
fishing expeditions to concoct charges which are later "proved" in court by
reference to the very same phone records (the set of records used in court
then being obtained after complying with all necessary procedures).

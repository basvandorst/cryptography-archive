I would like to get my hands on C source code that would allow me to
encrypt a file.  DES would be good.  If anyone knows of something,
would you send it along?

Unfortunately, I don't have access to anonymous FTP.  Also, I never
seem to be able to get mail servers to work.  If I could arrange with
someone to have a .tar uuencoded and emailed to me, that would be
great.

Thanx,
Rob.

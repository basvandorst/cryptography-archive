No, those speaking officially say Clipper has no back door, as a formal
official statement.

If NSA is caught lying in this matter during the next four or eight years,
many people can be fired or even go to jail. You can be sure a sitting
President won't tolerate being lied to in a matter as public and sensitive
as this, particularly when he puts his own reputation on the line.

Actually, I base my views on rational principles. I probably know a lot
more, in detail, about overflights, government wiretapping, and other such
behavior than you do. I was a working professional during the Berlin Tunnel
flap, the many cookings of data and outright falsehoods to get more money
for the defense budget, Lyndon Johnson's lying to the American people (I
served with a White House Commission in the Johnson Administration, whose
purpose was to do something about unemployment in America's urban ghettos,
and I could tell you stories that would curl your hair about the White House
then), Nixon, Agnew, etc. etc.

My position takes account of all of that history, but in a rational, not a
paranoid way (I'm not accusing you of being paranoid).

Please don't assume your correspondents here are ignorami or dunces.

Naah--I lived in Washington in the early NSA days and it was pretty much an
open secret in the press and elsewhere. There was even a joke going around
in the '50s that if you asked someone where they worked and they said
"The U.S. Government", they were CIA, and if they said "The Department of
Defense" they were NSA. Everybody else was more specific. There was also the
game of spotting people with chains around their necks that mysteriously
disappeared into the front of their shirts.

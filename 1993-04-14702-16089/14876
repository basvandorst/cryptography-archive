Hmm...  There are some flaws in that idea...  A close friend or family 
member would (most likely) be able to bypass that easily.  For example, 
my brothers friends are for the most part mine, and vice versa.  I could
easily access his account, and I'm relatively sure he could do the same.  
How could that be remedied?

   The PGP implementation of IDEA encrypts 8 bytes of random data,
followed by a repetition of the 1st 2 bytes. The correct password
can be told after 2 iterations of IDEA (using Cipher Feed Back).
   I have a question: If DES chips can do x million blocks per
second, how fast could an IDEA chip go? It's got to do
multiplication modulo 10001h 34 times per block-- can this be made
to go as fast as a DES chip with its shifts, rotates, and
permutations, which seem to be so much more hardware-oriented and
easy to pipeline?
  In other words, how many IDEA trials/sec could NSA do compared to
DES trials/sec?

Those folks seem to get very nervous any time something like cryptanalysis
gets mentioned in public, often for no good reason.  However...

I wonder if there's old traffic that they're still interested in
safeguarding.  Might there be intercepts in Russian archives of material
that would still be embarassing?  Or should we assume that in the
intervening decades, the KGB would have cryptanalyzed something like
SIGABA?

Actually, we are marketing our QCELP vocoder ASIC.  You can vocode,
encode in any way you like, then send over the modem or whatever other
medium you have.  I haven't brought it up as an alternative because
it's not standard PC hardware like a SoundBlaster.  The "secure" part
involved the spread spectrum transmission, which wouldn't be a lot of
use for general encryption/decryption.  The pc option board is an
interesting idea, I'll check with the vocoder group.  Ideally, you
should just plug the phone into it.  Normally it should just pass
everything through.  For encoded, you'd either send it via modem or
tcp/ip.

	just curious...will all this MIME going around...what is
required on each individual site to make use of it?  do we need
X-windows if someone sends a picture of themselves in an email/news
article?  On top of that...what happens if someone does do that, and
we aren't running X-windows?  Does that preclude us from actually
reading the article?

thanks...

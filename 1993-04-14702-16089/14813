You are correct for the most part, except:

1) one of the benefits of RSA is that the key distribution can be done
out of band.  You don't need to authenticate to B in order to get B's
key.. You just ask for it, either from a key server, finger file,
X.500 directory, or whatever...

2) You only need to get the certificate once, because once you have it,
you can cache it locally.

3) The certificate contains the Public Key in it, so where you
consider the Public Key and the Certificate as separate entities, in
PEM they are part of the same structure.

4) This is only the PEM hierarchy, which is not the only possible
trust model available.  For example, there is the RIPEM model, which
is "trust the keyservers" (meaning that there are no such things as
certificates), and there is the PGP model, which is a "web-of-trust",
where you trust people who's keys you can sign yourself, and then you
can web out trough introducers.

I hope this answers your question and clears up some things...

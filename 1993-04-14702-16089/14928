Yes, we hire policemen to do that job for us.  Among other things, I want
protection from people doing illegal wiretaps against me.  The "bad guys"
are those performing illegal wiretaps.

            ^^^^^^^^^

That's where the problem lies.  I can think of no organization more
efficient than the Gestapo or KGB or other fully enabled police force in a
police state.  I, for one, don't want my police force to be that efficient.

I want my police to be given the right to carry guns but at the same time I
want to make sure that they're prevented from using them casually.  For
every enabling of the police we need at least a counteracting enabling of
citizens' rights.

When it comes to wiretapping, since there is no way to detect if the crime
(invasion of privacy) has been committed, I want to make sure that citizens
can use solid end-to-end encryption.

You mentioned the World Trade Center bombing.  Note that the US Gov't *has*
the right to wiretap both for criminal and for national security
investigations.  The WTC was both.  That didn't stop the WTC bomb from
happening.



------------

The key argument about wiretapping, to me, is that the violation can not be
detected, short of having total 1984-style surveillance of all people --
therefore it is fruitless to pass laws against it.  Given that state of
affairs, it is important to use strong cryptography.

If you can come up with a way to enforce a law against illegal wiretapping
(ie., if you can show how to detect those wiretaps), then I'll consider
shifting my position.

For now, I advocate:

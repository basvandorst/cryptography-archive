   Professor Denning has already openly taken a position in print arguing
for some sort of key-registration.  Somehow, I doubt that her fear of
confronting opposing opinions is keeping her from posting.  Maybe (*gasp*),
due to some odd personality trait, she doesn't *like* having every statement
she makes attributed to her stupidity, or her evil intentions.  Maybe she
even has seen how well people with unpopular opinions get along on this
group (ie, David Sternlight), and doesn't like the idea of spending an hour
or more a day reading personal attacks on her ideas, actions, and motivations.
 
 
   *Sigh*  I wonder if it's possible to have an unmoderated technical group
where > 1/2 the posts aren't fluff and personal attacks....

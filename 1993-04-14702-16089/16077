Announcing RIPEM version 1.0.7.

RIPEM is a public key encryption program oriented toward use with
electronic mail.  It uses the RSAREF toolkit to encrypt messages 
with DES and RSA.  It is free for non-commercial users.

Source code and binaries for RIPEM are available via non-anonymous
FTP to ripem.msu.edu.  For information on how to get an account,
use anonymous FTP to ripem.msu.edu and get the file 
pub/crypt/ripem/GETTING_ACCESS.

This release of RIPEM implements many small bugfixes, speedups,
and other minor improvements.  If you are happy with your 1.0.6
or earlier release of RIPEM, there is no compelling reason to
upgrade to 1.0.7.

I don't expect there to be many more 1.0.x releases, as I gear up
for more substantial changes resulting in release 1.1 or 2.0 a few
months down the road.

Changes between 1.0.6 and 1.0.7:

+++ Fixed a bug in ripemmai.c that could cause a key to be written
to a bad filename when writing a key to PubKeyOutFileName upon
decrypting.

+++ Fixed a debug message "X bytes in encoded & encrypted message key:",
which could print a null pointer (in ripemmai.c).

+++ Added display of version number in debug output.

+++ Changed a call to prencode in rdwrmsg.c to zero-fill the input
buffer.  Not strictly necessary, but not doing so caused RIPEM to
printably encode buffers differently (for the last nibble in a line)
for different platforms, causing alarm amoungst RIPEM users.

+++ Added code to getsys.c to record keystroke timings for pseudo-random
data on Unix systems.  (Mark Henderson)

+++ Added DOGETRUSAGE #ifdefs to Linux version.  (Mark Henderson)

+++ Moved frequently-optimized code in RSAREF's nn.c to digitas.c.

+++ Ported to Windows NT (Intel 386), including adding some
386 in-line assember in rsaref/source/digitas.c

+++ Added GCC-compatible version of Intel assembler code in
digitas.c  (Mark Henderson)

+++ Split off NN_AddDigitMult and NN_SubDigitMult from RSAREF
into a separate file, digitas.c, since these are the routines that are most
frequently optimized.  

+++ Modified GetUserRecordFromServer in ripemsoc.c to zero-terminate
records received from the key server, to guard against key server
errors.

+++ Added "unsigned long long" versions of code in digitas.c to speed
up RS/6000 version of RSAREF.

+++ Changed RSAREF nn.c and prime.c to speed key generation by
substituting bignum left shifts for bignum multiplies by 2.
(Mark Henderson)

+++ Fixed a bug in the finger client in ripemsoc by always
clearing all file descriptor sets.

+++ Removed the debug print of user's key-to-private key in keyman.c,
as it is more of a security risk than it's worth.

+++ Made changes to makefiles to support Sun's acc compiler.
(Robert Howard)

+++ Added encryption test to makefile.

+++ Made minor changes to bemparse and util/tstbem to get tstbem
working again.

+++ Made minor typecast changes to getsys.c to satisfy system
function prototypes for memcpy.  (Suggested by Robert Howard)

+++ Added Makefile support for NeXTStep 486.

+++ Changed RIPEM's built-in Finger implementation again, this time
to use "/W user" to comply with RFC 1288.  (Suggested by Jurgen Bolz)

+++ Updated ripem-faq and ripem-attacks documents.  (Marc VanHeyningen)

+++ Added "util/ripem-encrypt-elm" to facilitate encryption when
using recent versions of Elm.  See script for details.  (Jon Zeeff)

+++ Added new version of "util/ripem-encrypt" script.  (Brent Chivers)

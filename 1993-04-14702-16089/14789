No, Watergate *was* a national security issue. Nixon said so
repeatedly each time he refused to cooperate with an investigation.

And who am *I* to question the judgement of someone who was duly
elected by the people, knows many things I do not, and says I would
agree with him if only it were possible to tell me those things which,
unfortunately, had to be kept secret for national security reasons?

Sarcasm off.

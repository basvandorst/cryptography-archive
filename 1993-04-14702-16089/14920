   On the other hand, if you have invented a way to extract overwritten
   data from a modern, high-capacity disk, you have invented a
   way to put twice or three times as much raw data _on_ that disk.

   Like the man from Micropolis said, "The rest of us would sure
   like to know how you do that."

You're forgetting the difference between what you can read and write
at high speed, reliably, with reasonably-priced equipment,
and what you can read if you don't mind going slowly, using expensive equipment,
and possibly losing a lot of bits.
Micropolis really cares about the first case - the second is for the
KGB/NSA and the trashed-disk-recovery market.

Another thing the NSA cares about that Micropolis doesn't usually is
that bad sectors may still have data in them.  Sure, the disk drive
won't read them withouth a lot of arguing with the controller,
but if they might have the TOP SECRET plans for invading Mexico,
it's worth doing more work to extract the data, and therefore worth
making sure you don't leave any of that data there when you recycle
the disk at your local hamfest...

   No, I understand. The problem is that the CO *will not accept* the whole
   source code, unless it is less than 50 pages. [...]
   I doubt if Lotus Notes is only fifty pages long. Thus you won't be able
   archive the source code publicly in this manner. Even if you could, I don't
   think Lotus would tolerate the marketing disadvantage of havings its source
   code available for anybody to study!

So you just copyright the crypto module and enough interface pieces to use it,
which should be *far* less than 50 pages.  If you're into open systems,
also copyright and release the data formats so other programs can
interface with yours.

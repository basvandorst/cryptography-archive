I had a begware crypto utility about 8 years ago that encrypted the data
and stored it on unused clusters that it then marked as bad.  The "directory"
was stored - also encrypted - on a floppy.  The only unusual indication was
lots of bad clusters.

This program came through in the crunch.  A client, rather than pay for
the code we'd developed for him, sent some thugs to break into our
office, held us captive and stole all our computers.  As a matter of
routine, we kept the source code encrypted.  In the lawsuit that
followed, the judge demanded the "key to the source codes" to be placed
in court custody.  We said "What key?"  Bought us enough time to have
his order vacated on appeal.  The other side had duped the hard drives - in
violation of a restraining order - before turning them over to the
court.  Hearing 'em piss'n'moan about not being able to find the sources
without actually admitting to violating the restraining order was very
funny.

Unfortunately this program was incompatable with anything more sophisticated 
than an ST-503 interface so it is history now.  Often thought about writing
another one.  Someone outta do it.

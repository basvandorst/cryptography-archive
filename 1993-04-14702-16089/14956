   What I'm looking for is to achieve nonrepeatance for at least 5 hours. 
   The whole thing should be software based (sysop nor users are rich 
   ennough for hardware scramblers).

   Any suggestions,please by Email or posted here.

My Thesis (which should be complete soon) is similar to this topic.  I
based my work upon Kerberos and DES.  As implemented, it allows a user
to securely obtain kerberos tickets on the remote system (BBS) without
having to type their password over the net (phone line) in clear text.

There are obvious extensions to this to include encrypting the
session.  This results from the Kerberos session key which is obtained
in the normal course of events.  A BBS could implement a subset of
kerberos for the server, and then the user can use this protocol to
securly obtain a session key for the BBS and then procede to DES
encrypt the whole session. (If you are going to distribute a com
program, then you can easily accomplish this -- I've already hacked
Kermit to use my protocol...)

More details upon request.  (Although I probably wont respond to
requests for at least a month while I finish the Thesis report).

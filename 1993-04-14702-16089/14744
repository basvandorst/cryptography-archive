Law enforcement, private investigations, etc... are fields where great
pressure to 'get the job done' is frequently exerted.  Just like computer
people, they will cut corners if they feel they have to and can get away
with it.

People who think laws against illegal wiretaps will always protect citizens 
are like managers who think rules for documenting s/w projects will always 
produce documented s/w.

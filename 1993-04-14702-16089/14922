Why append it with the executables? Any reasonable encryption algorithms
will produce a ciprtext which looks exactlly like a stream of random bits.
Why not pace it with other legitimate stream of random bits. For example,
the least significant bits of your favurable gif or even the spelling
mistakes in this post ! Not only you can keep it safely, you can post it
to the netork! I just wrnder whelther there are any real messages hiden
in the gigabytes of pictures and sounds under alt.binaries.*..

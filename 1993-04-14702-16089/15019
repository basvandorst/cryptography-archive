Call me paranoid, but this is the same kind of scare story which Dorothy
Denning was citing while calling for the limitation of cryptography.

I doubt that DD is behind this -- 

but I suspect that the FBI (and maybe NSA) are behind DD and those agencies
could easily be mounting a nationwide campaign (with our tax dollars?) to
build up public outcry against digital communication -- especially against
unbreakable, encrypted communication.


What's going on here??

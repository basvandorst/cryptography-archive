	Definitely not a happy story for this lady.  I was trying to find a
way to prevent the authorities from forcing you to give access to information
that would incriminate yourself.  So far, I've seen stuff like schemes to hide
the encrypted data on the hard drive, to using an incriminating pass phrase so
you can plead the fifth.  Hiding schemes won't work, because even if the FBI's
computer experts can't find the stuff, they would slap a court order requiring
you to tell them how to find it, leaving you in the same situation as before.
If you use an incriminating pass phrase, you'll be granted immunity to the 
crime described in the passphrase, and then required to divulge the passphrase
again.  However, if you use a good passphrase, you can say the passphrase is 
hard to remember, and claim you forgot.  Although you would technically be
guilty of perjury if you actually do remember your passphrase, as long as you
don't tell anyone your passphrase or even that you still remember your pass
phrase, there is no way to prove that you didn't forget the password (as long
as you aren't subjected to rubber hose interrogation :-) )

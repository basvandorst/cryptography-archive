But his requirement is easily satisfied by a public key system! The
key embedded in the program is useless for looking at the encrypted
output.

However, I agree that an attack would be to zap the binary to
(a) forget to call the encryption routine and (b) mail the output to
me, not the person sending out the mole. Cryptographically speaking,
though, a public key system is just right.

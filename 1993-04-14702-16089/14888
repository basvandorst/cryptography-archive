I'm not completely familiar with the hierarchy, but I believe it works
more-or-less as follows:

Jim-Miller has a certificate issued by suite.com. Jim-Miller has the only
copy of his private key. His certificate contains his public key. His
public key is signed using suite.com's private key and can be verified
using suite.com's public key.

Suite.com has the only copy of its private key (used, as shown above,
to sign its employees' signature files). It's public key was signed
using RSA's private key when RSA issued suite.com's public key.

Now, as long as you know RSA's public key, you can walk the certificate
chain to verify suite.com's public key and, thereby, verify Jim-Miller's
public key. Having verified the public key, you can then verify documents
signed using Jim-Miller's private key.

So, simply put, everybody has to trust the validity of RSA's public key,
which is distributed with signature-verification applications.

Hope this clarifies things.

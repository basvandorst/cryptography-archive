        That was certainly true when you could read the data on a
        platter with a magnifying glass and Magnetic Blue. On the
        other hand, if you have invented a way to extract overwritten
        data from a modern, high-capacity disk, you have invented a
        way to put twice or three times as much raw data _on_ that
        disk.

        Like the man from Micropolis said, "The rest of us would sure
        like to know how you do that."

        Cheers,
                Marc

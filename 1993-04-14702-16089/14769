As a senior member of the IEEE serving on the Intellectual Property
Committee, we have discussed patents and standards issues.  It was
*VERY* clear that both ANIS and IEEE *required* that any standard
utilizing a patent must have the patent holder agree to offer the
same terms to all-comers -- that does not mean that you will be
able to afford those terms... :-)

Much of Jonathan's posting then goes on about RSAREF and TIS potentially
getting their money not by a patent, but by a "certificate".  Unfortunately,
the RSAREF issue is a red herring in discussing a patent wrt a standard.

It was my understanding (which may well be wrong) that PEM only
brings in the signature aspect and not encrypting of the entire message.
If so, then PKP could easily license just the signature aspect to all-comers
while still restricting message encryption -- without doing anything wrong
as far as ANSI/IEEE standards are concerned.

However, if PKP is *NOT* offering the same terms for a patent that's
part of an ANSI/IEEE standard (proposed), then I would like to know and 
I will report it back to people at the IEEE.

p.s. I speak solely for myself here and in no way for the IEEE !!!

No, but I can build you one!

Because PGP is distributed with its source, you only need to edit the
code rather than patch the binary to make a hacked copy. This makes
tampering with the executable within the reach of anyone with a compiler,
rather than just within the reach of those with detailed knowledge of
file structure on your favourite OS. You *need* to be alert with the
PGP executables.

Needless to say, if PGP were distributed without source it would still
be possible to circulate a weak copy, it's just less likely that you'd
get one by random chance alone. (Probably not much though: I'd expect
the sort of person who would tamper with the sources would be the sort
of person who would (and could) patch a binary.)

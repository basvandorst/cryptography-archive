I am writing a paper on the FBI "Wiretap" Proposal.

I would like information on how this affects the crypto/telecom
industry.  Specifically:

    -  Are there any companies involved in Crypto research which
       are affected by the proposal?

    -  Have any companies publically taken a position either for
       or against the proposal.

    -  Have any companies or individuals involved in crypto research
       been solicited to help execute a 'wiretap'?  (A company or 
       individual who's primary employer is not a law enforcement agency)

Thanks & Regards,
John

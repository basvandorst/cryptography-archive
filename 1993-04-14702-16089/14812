I'll do one better. I'll put the NY case up on the cpsr.org archive
(FTP/wais/gopher/email) in /cpsr/communications_privacy/wiretap
as soon as I get off of here..

Toll records are not protected. All it requres is an administrative
subpoena from a law enforcement agency. The phone co's are pretty
annoyed with this since they have to hire large staffs to fill the 
thousands of requests they get each year. It is basicly used for
fishing
around before they have real probable cause and is frequenty abused.
Last year, the IRS got annoyed that a reporter for a small tax
magazine
had overcovered that they had improperly given tax breaks. The IRS 
responded by pulling his phone records, and the records of the Alecia
Patterson Foundation, which had given him a grant, and also the
records 
of a real estate saleman and a few other innocent bystanders.


Pen Registers require a warrant under the wiretap act, as ammended 
by ECPA to override the Supreme Court in Smith v. Maryland. They
are also required to submit annual reports to the Congress. The use
of these have significantly increased in the last few years to
somewhere 
around 2000/year (don't have the figures in front of me right this
sec).

Keep in mind that some export restrictions have nothing to do with
governments.  Often a company that doesn't have its own overseas
distribution channel will sign a distribution agreement with an overseas
distributer. These agreements often give the distributer exclusive rights
to sell in, for example, Europe.  Thus other channels such as CompUSA or
MacWarehouse would be forbidden to export the product (at least to those
markets covered by the agreement).

I have no idea whether this is the case with Laplink, but it is a
possibility.

(One of the real problems with these sorts of exclusive deals is that they
effectively eliminate price competition in the covered markets, an effect
that is evident in the outrageous prices that Europeans pay for some
software.)

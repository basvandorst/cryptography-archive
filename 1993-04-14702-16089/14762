How about this.  I create a bunch of sets of random data, and encrypt it.  I 
keep only one of the sets of random data around, to show that I encypt random
data for kicks.  The rest, I delete with their keys.  I tell all my friends.
I think this establishes reasonable doubt about the contents of any encrypted
files, and my ability to provides keys.  Since anyone could do this, any law
that forces a user to provide keys on demand is worthless.

They failed, of course.  Seems as though that motorcade through downtown Dallas
trick only works once.

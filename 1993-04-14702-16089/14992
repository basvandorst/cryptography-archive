The easiest thing for you to do would be to find one of the
freely-available DES implementations and use it.  A DES key is 64
bits, and pretty much all of them can accept the key in hex form.

The sci.crypt FAQ, I think, has listings of where you can get DES
implementations, or you could use 'archie'.

I think you can get the sci.crypt FAQ from rtfm.mit.edu (seriously,
that's the name) in /pub/usenet/sci.crypt.  I'm sure about the
sitename, but I'm not sure if the FAQ is there because it's
newly-released.

(Some DES programs for UNIX accept a password and then munge the
password with a hash fn to get a DES key -- thus they're not
compatible if you use passwords but will be compatible if you use hex
keys, which are harder to brute-force search anyway because you can't
use a dictionary.)

I'll try to find where my favorite DES implementation went and then
I'll post again.

You can use 'uuencode' if you want to e-mail the encrypted version of
a file to someone.

Ah, but this assumes that the Clipper chip is so cheap and easy to use
that every manufacturer will voluntarily use it. It's not.

Consider that there are probably many more software DES's out there
than hardware DES chips. Software DES is perfectly adequate for many
applications, especially in low-rate communications where a general
purpose CPU with adequate cycles is already available. And given the
enormous pressure on parts cost in consumer products, I dare say that
any company with an eye on the bottom line (i.e., any company but AT&T
:-)) would have a hard time justifying the use of an expensive,
sole-sourced hardware encryption part when software encryption would
do just as well -- or better (no escrowed keys).

Unless, of course, they are forced to use it.

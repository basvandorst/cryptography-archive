Here is an exchange of e-mail messages between RSA Data Security, Inc and  
myself regarding the RC2 encryption algorithm and the summary of comments I  
posted last week....

Jim:
I saw your summary of comments on our RC2 and RC4 algorithms.
I'd like to submit a few clarifications:

1. The reason RC2 and RC4 remain unpublished is, in fact, to
protect our intellectual property. The NSA and export have nothing
to do with it -- both algorithms predate the expedited export
agreement with SPA/NSA by several years.  

2. Full details on the
algorithms and complete source code is available under
a standard non-disclosure agreement with RSA. If you
are worried about strength or trapdoors, find your
most trusted cryptographer or mathematician, have him 
evaluate the algorithms under NDA with us, and then 
ask him what he thinks.

3. Object code for either algorithm is available direct
from RSA for $100 on PC, Mac or Sun.  You may evaluate
the validity of our throughput numbers and memory
requirements yourself.

4. RC2 and RC4 were developed for serious encryption applications, and
are part of the security of everything from satellite transmission systems
to mass-market software and operating systems.  The statement that
RC2 "is *not* high security encryption" is very misleading: are you
using a key size of 30 bits or 100 bits? Their security depends 
entirely on the key size YOU SELECT. A lot of our customers' best
technical people have seen and evaluated the algorithms, and
their subsequent licenses seem to disagree with the statement made
that "(RC2 is) nothing to use with really valuable data."

As I said earlier, RC2 and RC4 are available separately, or
as part of our commercial software developer's kit BSAFE.
TIPEM, RSA's toolkit for privacy-enhanced messaging, 
also contains RC2 routines.

Kurt,

Not being a cryptographer myself, and not knowing one personnally, I have no  
direct way of verifying the quality of the RC2 algorithm.  Therefore I asked  
the people on "sci.crypt" for their opinion.  All the remarks in the summary I  
posted were made by the people from "sci.crypt" who responded to my questions.

Perhaps it would be a good idea to post a comment yourself to "sci.crypt" to  
clarify any incorrect or misleading statements presented in my summary.

By the way,  you may want to update the "Answers to Frequently Asked Questions  
About Today's Cryptography" document put out by RSA Laboratories.  It clearly  
states that the RC2 and RC4 algorithms must remain unpublished in order to  
maintain their special export status.  See page 40 of the file  
"/pub/faq/faq.ps" at the "rsa.com" ftp site.

Jim:
Thanks for your response - I hope the RC2 /RC4 info was helpful.
As you've probably noticed, RSA makes a point of NOT posting
directly to unmoderated newsgroups like sci.crypt, although
we do post quite regularly to several moderated discussions,
such as comp.risks.  You, of course, are free to post my letter
if you wish.

Thanks for the FAQ modification.  We will update it promptly.

What I get from this exchange is that the RC2 algorithm does not have to remain  
unpublished in order to maintain its special export status.  RSA says that it  
is not publishing RC2 to protect its intellectual property.

One thing I wonder is whether or not the RC2 algorithm is patented.  Is it  
possible to patent an algorithm without revealing how it works?

If it is not patented, does that mean someone could disasseble a program that  
uses RC2 and legally post the algorithm to the Net?

If I were RSADSI, I would patent the algorithm.

we all know about how the DOS "delete" doesn't really do what one would
think it does, but I was wondering if the following procedure helps in
making disk drives more secure:

problem:  to remove the data in (so-called) "deleted" files as well as the
ones in temporary workfiles which are normally unknown and/or invisible.

possible solution: run chkdsk/f often to get ris of any extra sectors. 
then run "diskopt" or a similar disk manager/ de-fragmenter.

question: will this remove all those chunks of data?

thanks

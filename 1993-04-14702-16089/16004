[about scanning clipper and reverse-engineering the algorithm]

	Yeah, you're missing the obvious fact that since the algorithm
is classified, if you reverse engineer it from the chip, and later
publish it, or build a compatible chip, you're divulging classified
information and are in a big load of trouble.

	I don't think the classification of the skipjack is to keep it
*secret* necessarily. It's to allow the government to stomp you into a
paste if you visibly learn anything about it and try to divulge it.

This all makes sense if you are talking about message digest functions.
But "hash function" has a definition of longer standing, namely a
function which hashes its inputs into a (hopefully uniformly dis-
tributed) (probably smaller) range of outputs, with no requirement
for non-invertibility.  They've been used for non-cryptographic
reasons (such as symbol table maintenance) for years.

Message digest functions certainly should be non-invertible.

This thread brings up the more general question.  Can any crypto 
implementation for which highly publicly scrutinized source code is not 
available EVER be trusted?  I don't want to quibble about levels of
threat.  Let's assume the crypto system is used against high level threats,
to protect one's self from the government, for example.  

Or to put the question another way, what steps, if any, could be taken
to gain confidence in commercial, binary-only crypto implementations?

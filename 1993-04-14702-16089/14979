I'm not a lawyer, so correct me if I'm wrong, but doing that could be
considered obstruction of justice, which could land you in prison for
quite a while.

The thing that's great about the secret key is it is IDEA encrypted, so
even if the FBI do get the key, they're SOL unless they know the magic
word.  If they try to force you to give them your pass phrase, just say
"Oops, I forgot."  Since the burden of proof is still on the prosecution
in this country, if you keep your mouth shut, how can they prove that you
didn't forget your pass phrase.

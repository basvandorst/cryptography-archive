Hi, Netters,

Several months ago in a popular science magazine, there
appeared as a game a series of messages to be sent to
ETI's to establish communication.  The first message was
just a list of the symbols to be used,  the author used
letters of the English alphabet.  Subsequent messages 
defined the symbols as mathematical symbols by context.

I cannot find the article anymore.  If anyone has the 
reference or the messages themselves,  please e-mail them
to me.

Much thanks,

Ralph

See A Granville, Notices of the AMS v 39 no 7 pp 696 - 700, `Primality Testing
and Carmichael Numbers' for a sketch of the result (we reviewed this in the first
issue of `Computer and Communication Security Reviews'). The full proof is 
circulating as a preprint, which is by WR Alford, Andrew Granville and Carl 
Pomerance and is entitled `There are infinitely many Carmichael Numbers'. 

It shows that there are more than x^{2/7} Carmichael numbers up to x, for all 
sufficiently large x. Numerical work by Richard Pinch at our pure maths
department suggests that there might be somewhat more than this (there are just 
over 10^5 of them up to 10^15), and the best known upper bound is 
x^{1-[1+O(1)]log log logx/log log x}.

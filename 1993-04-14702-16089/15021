I spent a bit of time and skullsweat trying to cause the bit on the dedication
page to discharge its informational content, to no avail.  If I recall
correctly, someone here on r.a.b. opined that the message consists in fact
of the initials of folks Mr. Powers wished to dedicate the novel to.  Note
that all the letters are in triplets, and that several have `huh?' marks, but
they all appear in the middle of a triplet.

The message is:

	RLS	CMW	DJP	RFP	J?O	CEP	JJN	PRG
	ZTS	MCJ	JEH	BLM	CRR	PLC	JCM	MEP
	JNH	JDM	RBS	J?H	BJP	PJP	SCB	TLC
	KES	REP	RCP	DTH	I?H	CRB	JSB	SDG

In light of the reason Clipper exists, the purpose for which it
is designed, I'm less concerned about whether it's a back door 
or an escrow.  I sent a letter to Clinton's email address this 
afternoon, stating that the federal agencies have thus far been 
remarkably inept at dealing with electronic data not be given 
more access to it; e.g., Steve Jackson Games and the previous
thread of requests by the NSA to stop encrypted transmissions,
even when those encryptions were not illegal.

Just a reminder, Clinton's address is 75300.3115@compuserve.com.

French Wiretapping Scandal Leads to Electorial Defeat
    
by Dave Banisar, Special to the Privacy Times

	The French Socialist Party suffered a resounding defeat in parlimentary
elections on March 21 and 28 in part due to a wiretapping  scandal that
broke a week before the elections.  Results showed that they lost over
200 seats in the Parliment and became the minority party. Socialist
President Francois Mitterrand will remain in office but is expect to face
a tough election in 1994.
	The scandal emerged after reports and transcripts were leaked to Paris
Daily Liberation that a special counter-intelligence group directly
responsible to President Mitterrand illegally wiretapped  numerous people
during the 80's.  Included in those wiretaps was Edwy Plenel, a famous
investigative journalist for Le Monde, who broke the story that French
agents were behind the bombing of the Greenpeace ship Rainbow Warrier in
New Zealand in 1986.  Plenel's appartment, and work phone were tapped.
Other indviduals wiretapped included Franois Froment-Meurice, the deputy
leader leader of the Social Democratic Centre - an opposition party,
actress and Chenel perfume model Carole Bouquet, lawyer Antoine Comte,
and  writer Jean-Edern Hallier, who published a phamphlet called "The
Lost Honor of Francois Mitterrand."  Hallier's personal phone was not
tapped but the the phones at his office, his cook's appartment and
several bars that he frequented were tapped by French agents.
	The head of the counter-terrorism group was later given the French
Legion of Honor award for heading security at the 1992 Albertville Winter
Olympics. Plenel, Froment-Meurice, and  Haillerand now plan to file suit
against the French Government to discover who ordered the taps.
	In 1990, the European Court of Human Rights condemmed the French
goverment for illegal wiretapping. The Court found that "French law,
written and unwritten, did not provide the applicants with the minimum
degree of protection to which citizens were entitled under the rule of
law in a democratic society."1 This resulted in  a new French law on
wiretapping, which was enacted in 1991.  The new law allows for
wiretapping  with a warrant but also mandates cooperation from service
providers. It also specifically exempts cellular and other wireless
communications for protection. Documents obtained by Computer
Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR) indicate that the 1991
French law may have provided the basis for the FBI's 1992 Digital
Telephony Proposal, which was rejected by Congress in 1992 when no
Congressman and Senator was willing to sponsor it.
	More recently, author Peter Schweizer reported in his book Friendly
Spies that the French government regularly wiretaps conversations of
foreign companies for industrial information which is then passed onto
French companies. 2 He wrote that some companies, such as IBM, regularly
send false information to their French subsidiaries to confuse French
intelligence.

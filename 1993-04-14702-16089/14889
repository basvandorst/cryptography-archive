I realize the operating system has to load entire blocks, but after
copying the file into memory it could wipe all memory past the nominal
end-of-file.

Better yet, it could require that executable files contain all zeros after
the nominal end-of-file, and report any executable file which contained
non-zero data as corrupted.

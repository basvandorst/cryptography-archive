	This is (sort of) true, but irrelevant.  _Yes_, RFC 1421-24 are
the specifications for PEM, and _yes_, the Internet Activities Board
has no problem with every Tom, Dick, and Harry implementing them; in fact,
they would probably encourage it.

	Unfortunately, _use_ of any such implementation without a patent
license from Public Key Partners is illegal in the United States.  PKP
does not grant such a license to individuals on "non-discriminatory terms,"
in my opinion:

	Public Key Partners holds the patents for RSA.  They have granted
license RSA Data Security, Inc. to discribute RSAREF and RIPEM, but have
consistently refused to license Phil Zimmerman to distribute PGP.

	The IAB has a policy (RFC 1310) of setting standards including
patented methods, algorithms, and processes only when the holders of
such licenses give written assurances to the IAB that licenses to use
these patents are available to all-comers on a non-discriminatory basis;
PKP has failed to provide any such assurances (with respect to RSA
encryption of DEK's).

	In short: yes, you're free to implement PEM, but no, you're not
free to use it.  :-(

	This is patently false.  PKP has only agreed to license RSA
encryption of digital signatures (RFC 1170); nothing else has been agreed
to.

	RSA Data Security did recently offer me a licence (unsolicited)
for TIPEM, whose functionality I cannot attest to, for a mere $15,000
plus "2-5 percent royalties."  How much of this cost is passed back
to PKP is anyone's guess.

	How nice it is to hear that RSADSI is "accepting requests" to
use the code in other ways.  When PKP is prepared to allow RSADSI to
allow access to the RSA encryption routines themselves, let me know;
I'm not holding my breath.

	While the TIS/PEM is currently being distributed on a beta-site
basis for free, I haven't read any authoritative statements by TIS that
this will continue after the beta-testing period.  Furthermore, the
beta-site license agreement clearly states that "users must obtain
certificates through the regular certificate issuing channels and pay
whatever fees are required."

	Now, I read this as signalling TIS's intention to collect revenues
by only licensing TIS/PEM in conjunction with keys which _they_ certify.

	In other words, TIS will not allow me to use TIS/PEM to exchange
mail with my buddies without me paying TIS to register my key.

	I'm more convinced than ever that PEM isn't going to get off the
ground until either PKP starts licensing RSA on attractive terms, or the
patents run out.  Since the former requires PKP to commit the equivalent
of corporate suicide, I think we can expect to wait until September 8,
2000 before PEM comes to the United States.

	Europe, of course, will have it in place much sooner.

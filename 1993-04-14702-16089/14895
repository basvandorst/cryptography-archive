There has been a fair amount of discussion (plenty worthy, mind you) on
the ethical/moral standing of patents on encryption algorithms.  There is
another angle -- financial.  If I wanted to write a program that used PKC
or digital signatures, I'd have to pay a licensing fee to one of several
groups who have an oligopoly on the market (save for DES).  Now, I don't
know what those fees run (see below), but I cannot imagine that they're in
the realm of what a sole programmer or small outfit could afford.  That's
one of the reasons why I'm hoping for NIST to get DSS's legal status
settled -- it would provide a free-use digital signature algorithm.

That said -- out of curiousity, does anyone know what licenses for RSA,
LUC, or anything else patented runs?  I'm guessing several thousand
dollars, but I may be off by a mile...

On a related note, am I missing any other free-use (and not yet broken)
digital signature algorithms?  I realize that PKP claims patent coverage
over every such algorithm, but ignore that for the moment...

The word "trust" brings up the question "for what purpose?"

I have no problem trusting the STU-III for classified traffic.  I'd
use it, if I had a clearance and a need to work with the stuff
(fortunately, I don't).  Presumably the NSA knows what they're doing,
and they're sufficiently motivated to protect classified traffic.

But I'll be damned if I'd trust the STU-III to protect my personal privacy
against the government. I'd be very surprised if the STU-III didn't already
have its equivalent of the "Law enforcement exploitation block".

The reason the skipjack algorithm is classified is because it is good.
There is no known way of attacking it using brute force or through a back
door. The last thing the US government wants is for our enemies to use it
or a variant against us. By not telling how it works they can protect the
design principles. Therefore the only way they will let it out into the
world is in a tamperproof chip with the law enforcement block.

This seems to be the most logical explanation for whats going on.

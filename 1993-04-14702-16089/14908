My understanding is that the situation in UK is also as Tal Kubo writes. BT keep
logs of all calls for their own management purposes for two years. These 
records are made available to the police by formal request but without warrant.
Such records, combined with modern data analysis methods are becoming of key 
importance in large scale crime investigations where establishing patterns of 
connectivity is a most valuable investigative tool. Examples include a major 
drugs investigation (NL) and building society fraud (UK).

I'm running some informal tests on folks' ability to type longer
passphrases.  I'd appreciate it if you could connect to
research.att.com (192.20.225.2) and log in as pwgen.  Then just follow
instructions.  Try as many times as you'd like; the more, the merrier.
The passphrases consist of random words selected from /usr/dict/words;
no semantic meaning should be attached to any of it...

P.S.  *Please* don't look around for other interesting stuff on the
system (though there is an ftp area).  The machine is festooned with
alarms, and I'm not in the mood to scan lots of extra log messages --
we get enough as is.

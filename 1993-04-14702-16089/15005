PGP would be *perfect* for this.

Your friend could give you his public key through the networks.
Security doesn't matter because it's supposed to be public. Then you
could use it to encrypt the file so that only your friend could
decrypt it. Your friend retrieves it and decrypts it.

You don't have to use the phone. And the information is probably more
secure since the IDEA cipher uses has a 128 bit keyspace compared to
DESs 56 bits. Of course it hasn't been as heavily cryptoanalyzed as DES, but
no weaknesses have been found to date.

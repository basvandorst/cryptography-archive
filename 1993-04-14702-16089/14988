You are right.

I just presented the method, as it's most commonly used. Naturally you can
invent any method of your own to destroy the run, or use the proposal of
Wheatstone, who tells you that you may use other squares than 5x5 and in the
above example would transpose the matrx once before using it to encrypt.
(This would give you:
 HBCOV
 IUFPW
etc.)
But even if you will an arbitrary matrix with an arbitrary alphabeth, this
will not make playfair much stronger. If the enciphered text has more than
say 200 characters, and is in known language, I suppose it can be broken
by the classical methods of Hill and others. (No, I do _not_ know what exactly
are these methods, but I guess they use bigram-statistics, and exploit the 
symmetries which occur when using case 3 for the encryption...)

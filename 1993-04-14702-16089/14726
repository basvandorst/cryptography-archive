	That's illegal. So if you did it, they *do* have something to
pin on you.

	Why not just use a hard disk encryption product? Buy something
like the Fischer DES board and do triple-DES+RSA to your hard disk, and
give them something to really think about. It's even legal. For now.

	Is forcing someone to hand over the keys to one's hard disk
forcing someone to incriminate themself?

Dan Farmer here...

In an effort to support the on-going "Preserve the Earth" efforts, I 
am taking on the responsiblitiy of recycling aluminum cans.
For the betterment of the environment and my own personal cause --
the proceeds will help fund my first annual field trip to Nordstroms --
please feel free to participate!

The trip will include:

	Personal Color Analysis 
	Skin Care Demonstrations
	Latest European Suit Trends & Styles (w/ Mombo Silk Ties... 
					      Italian, of course!)
	... (more)

	And all of this followed by a trip to Miaki's for some
	excellent sushi and sashimi's. Of course there will be 
	plenty of my favorite Sake Tamake.

Field Trip Date:  April 17, 1993 at 10:00 a.m.

The recycling effort will also start my fund toward the purchase of 
one, fab BIMMER!

For more information and to sign up, please e-mail me at dan.farmer@Corp.

Please drop off all aluminum cans at my office in PAL1 # 4419, beginning
4/2/93.  If it is successful, I will help you start your own "can drive."

Thanks!

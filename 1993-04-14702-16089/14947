Many of the uses of hash functions occur in cases where your condition that
the hash produces an output of the same length as its input is not applicable.

The typical case is one in which one is trying to use N bits to keep track
of a sparse set of points in a space whose size is bigger than 2**N.

In the case where h(h(i))=i is acceptable, most uses of hashing (not including
those relating to encryption) would be quite content with h(i)=i.

I've been doing quite a lot of research of the issue recently
and there have been numerous cases of illegal wiretaps. For
example (and this is in no way an exhaustive list).

In 1992 in Conn, the police dept. settled for over $3 million
for illegal eavesdropping on all conversations going out of the
police station including confidential communications between
atty and clients, lawyers and their partners, police officers
and their friends, maintainance staff etc. A congressional
hearing held in 1989 on the issue found that the same thing were
going on in numerous other states.

In Ga, a sheriff and 2 deputies were sentanced to several years
of hard time illegal wiretapping. (90-91) The Missouri state
police had a massive scandal in 91 over illegal wiretaps.

In 1988 in Los Vegas, a DEA agent was convicted of illegal
wiretapping but his conviction was overturned when it turned out
that the FBI had illegally put a video camera in his office. He
had converted a pen register to do wiretaps.

Lawrence Tribe's phone 3 years ago was found to have a tap on
it. It was never discovered who did it.

In NY, the highest court in 1993 banned the use of pen registers
becuase the devices they were using only needed a flip of a
switch to turn them into a wiretap. The court found that there
was too high a danger of the registers being used to illegally
wiretap.

In fact, the OTA report on Electronic Surveillance and Civil
Liberties from 1985 cites the FBI as saying that they had 500
known instances of illegal wiretaps in 1980 and at least
300 in 84.

A brief perusal though LEXIS easily shows that Dr. Denning has
been misinformed by the bureau on this issue.

A last point: Watergate? It certainly wasnt a national security 
case and it was after 68.....

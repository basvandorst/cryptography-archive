This is kind of vague here.  You don't mention whether or not the police
identified themselves.  You make it sound like they stormed in, this man
had NO idea who they were (and thus got his gun to defend against intruders),
and was subsequently shot.  If this was the case (which it may well have
been), then I feel that yes, the rancher got screwed.  You still must
understand that most law enforcement agents is gonna cover their butts if
they see a potential suspect pull a gun.  If however the police did identify themselves, and rancher, Don Scott, came to the door with his gun...shooting
him becomes much less questionable.
Another question...did he have the gun pointed at them?  There are many
more questions that must be asked, and which WILL be in a court of law.

I'm not too sure about the accuracy of spectographic analysis, but I do
know that it has been used as for determining the presence of toxins.
We're talking about LA...there's probably so much stuff in the air and soil
that just about any nearby ranch would show up as positive! :)  Just
because it hasn't been previously used to obtain a warrant, does not
invalidate its use though.

This does sound a bit suspicious, but filling out paperwork is far from
being illegal. :)

Well, as I said above, it may have been justified.  The jury in this
case will look at all the presented facts, and only then will they be able
to decide.  As for this incident taking "under five seconds"...
Unfortunately, police have to make life/death decisions in under five
seconds when in a situation with a possibly dangerous person who
has a gun.  The officer who doesn't, ends up a dead cop.

Yes, there are a lot of corrupt individuals, and this even includes
government officials (I personally think all of congress is crooked :)  ),
and police officers.  I however am not totally convinced that this is
a case of the system being manipulated.  I don't think that the police
in the planes that fly by and use spectrographic analysis first look
and say "Hey, that looks like a nice piece of real estate, let's first
call HQ and have a credit report on this guy and then do our analysis."

Oh well, just my two cents.

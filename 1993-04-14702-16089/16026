(:-)

Also, remember how/why she was able to crack their codes? Clerks'
sloppiness, laziness and ignorance  (which led to non-compliance
with crypto procedures, prescribed by those hired pros).

It may well be, that if the crypto rules were observed with military 
precision, the state wouldn't win that case...

You mean they can't pay a CS or EE student to design a chip to
their specs? (:-) And to pay his professors to keep them happy?
Well, of course, SOME of them  (in georgetown.edu)  will NEVER 
collaborate (:-), but others might...

Answer: But in case drug lords try to use it (however unlikely it
        may be) - we'll be there, waiting for 'em.  Not convinced 
        yet? That's suspicious (:-).

   I do not believe TIPEM was a typo.  I've heard of it before, though I
   don't know much about it.

TIPEM is RSADSI's "Toolkit for Interoperable Privacy Enhanced
Messaging", which is available from RSADSI (contact them for more
details).  It is a toolkit for putting digital signatures and digital
envelopes on data.  It is only a library, and does not give any user
code -- which means that you need to write a program to actually use
it for anything useful.

There are also a number of mis-features in the library, which I don't
want to go into here.  (I was using it last summer, and found a bug in
the library, but couldn't debug it since I didn't have code for it!)
It is PKCS compliant, and can read all PEM messages w/o any
cryptographic conversion (although you do need some cosmetic
conversions.)

I hope this helps...

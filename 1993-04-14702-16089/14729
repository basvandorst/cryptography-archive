But how can they prove the material is encrypted?  Just because I like
to keep files of random bytes on my disk with a .pgp extension...

I think this is *the* fundamental physical reason why outlawing
encryption is futile: it is theoretically impossible to distinguish
well-encrypted material from a truly random collection of bytes
(without the key, that is).

And if they start making arrests based upon harboring random bytes then
my modem is going to spend a lifetime in the pokey.

It's also a "fact of the industry" that there have been all sorts of
proprietary e-mail solutions and systems... but which system will
actually allow you to send e-mail to millions of people, several
orders of magnitude more than any other system?

It *is* doable.  And once PEM-in-MIME is defined more MUAs are going to
be appearing with support for it built-in.

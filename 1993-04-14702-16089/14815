I don't have a passport and I've never seen an American one, so I don't know
what this "barcode" looks like.

Is it a bar code, like on packages at the supermarket, or is it a magnetic
strip, like on bank/credit cards?

If it's a real bar code, of course it's read-only.  Unless they run it through
a printer or somehting...

If it's a magnetic strip, it depends on what kind of equipment they run it
through.  They may or may not write to it.

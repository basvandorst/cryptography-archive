The above assumes that the person posting the algorithm to the net has
obtained a copy of its implementation from RSADSI under a NDA. Or that
RSADSI can trace the link to somebody who has broken a NDA. It ain't
necessarily so... Suppose that you see a posting from ivan@kgbvax.kremlin.su
to alt.sources that presents an implementation of the RCx algorithms
in source. You can easily verify that the implementation is compatible
with the programs RSADSI sells. Afterwards you can examine,
cryptanalise, copy, distribute, whatever the programs at your ease...

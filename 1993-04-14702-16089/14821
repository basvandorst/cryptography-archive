Ross,

Thanks for the reply.  Strange as this may sound, I didn't mean to ask whether  
or not RSA Data Security, Inc.'s cryptosystem is correct.  I assume it is,  
otherwise they would be laughed of business rather quickly.  I merely meant to  
find out if I correctly understood what it does and how it works.

I am currently looking at RSA Data Security, Inc.'s marketing material and they  
don't do a very good job of explaining how their system works when there exists  
a hierarchy of Certifying Authorities.

Is there anyone out there who is familiar with RSA Data Security, Inc.'s  
cryptosystem and could explain how it works within a hierarchy of Certifying  
Authorities?

Thanks,

Jim-Miller@suite.com

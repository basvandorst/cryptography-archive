	First of all, PKP has _NOT_ agreed to offer the same licensing terms
to "all comers," at least with respect to RSA encryption of messages.
RFC 1421 (Privacy Enhanced Mail) explicitly states that RFC 1170 documents
PKP's "assurances" with regards to patent issues:

   these patents.  This assurance is documented in RFC 1170 titled
   "Public Key Standards and Licenses".  A copy of the written assurance
   dated April 20, 1990, may be obtained from the Internet Assigned
   Number Authority (IANA).
					(quoted from RFC 1421)

	When we read RFC 1170, we find PKP's statement:

   Due to the broad acceptance of RSA digital signatures throughout the
   international community, Public Key Partners strongly endorses its
   incorporations in a digital signature standard.  We assure the
   interested parties that Public Key Partners will comply with all of
   the policies of ANSI and the IEEE concerning the availability of
   licenses to practice this art.  Specifically, in support of any RSA
   signature standard which may be adopted, Public Key Partners hereby
   gives its assurance that licenses to practice RSA signatures will be
   available under reasonable terms and conditions on a non-
   discriminatory basis.

					(quoted from RFC 1170)

	Notice that RSA encryption of _messages_ is never mentioned; PKP
is only promising a license to allow RSA encryption of "digital signatures."
In other words, RSA encryption of Data Encryption Keys (DEK's) is not
covered by the agreement.

	Of course, PKP _DOES_ offer RSAREF free to "all comers" (at least
those eligible under US ITAR restrictions.)  But is RSAREF capable of
RSA encryption of DEK's?  Of course not!  The license terms of RSAREF
explicitly prohibit any use of RSAREF other than that defined by the
"published interface" without written permission of PKP:

     d.   Prior permission from RSA in writing is required for any
          modifications that access the Program through ways other
          than the published Program interface or for modifications
          to the Program interface. RSA will grant all reasonable
          requests for permission to make such modifications.

					(quoted from RSAREF license
					 agreement, available via FTP
					 from rsa.com)

	The written interface for RSAREF only allows encryption of
messages with a DES DEK, encrypted via an RSA key of RSAREF's creation.
In other words, RSAREF requires you to accept DES as the data encryption
scheme for your data, a restriction not present in RFC 1421.

	Your last option for PEM is from Trusted Information Systems
Incorporated (TIS), which is developing an implementation of PEM (TIS/PEM)
under contract from DARPA; beta-testing of TIS/PEM is currently occuring.
Reading the fine print of the announcement, however, we find that:

   o When the system is released for regular use, users must obtain
     certificates through the regular certificate issuing channels and
     pay whatever fees are required.  During the test period, there is no
     charge for certificates.  When a regular certificate issuing mechanism
     is in place you will be informed.

					(TIS/PEM beta invitation/license)

Furthermore, the licence agreement specifies that TIS/PEM can _only_ be
used with Certification Authorities which TIS authorizes:

   2. TIS/PEM is to be used only with certificates issued under a
      Certification Authority which is itself registered under a permanent
      or temporary Policy Certification Authority (PCA).  TIS is operating
      a PCA and will supply PCA services without charge during the beta
      test period.

					(ibid)

	Reading between the lines, we see that TIS intends to use PEM as
a revenue source, by controlling public-key distribution and charging for
the privilege of using the CA.

	PEM, as an Internet RFC, is a total joke.  It will never enter
widespread use until low-cost (= free!) implementations are available.
This will not happen as long as PKP controls the licenses to RSA.  PKP
will never allow the general-purpose, free use of RSA encryption by the
general public, because the four patents it has exclusive licenses to
are PKP's only assets; without them, they have no reason for existence.

	Until September 20, 2000, use of encrypted message traffic will
remain an Outlaw Practice (at least in the United States.)  Actually, I'm
sort of happy about that; it keeps the "Fight the Power/Question Authority"
mystique surrounding cryptography.

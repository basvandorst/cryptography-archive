I recently learned that William Friedman's patent applications relating 
to the SIGABA cipher machine (dating back to 1933) remain sealed under 
patent secrecy orders.  According to the Patent and Trademark Office, 
the Armed Services Patent Advisory Board has made continuous, annual 
determinations that "the national interest requires renewal of the 
secrecy order[s]."  This status has apparently prevented the exhibition 
of the SIGABA machine at the Smithsonian, which displays an ENIGMA 
machine and other cryptographic items of historical significance.  This 
raises some questions:

1) Is there anything about SIGABA that warrants continued 
classification?

2) Is there anything about SIGABA that would render its patent 
information commercially valuable today?

3) What is the historical significance of SIGABA in the development of 
American cryptography?

Because forfeiture is a civil matter.  Therefore, they don't have to prove
guilt, they just have to claim something that seems plausible.  Whether or
not there has been a real legal infraction doesn't really matter -- the point
is that you are left to defend yourself, and forced to expend large sums of
monies you no longer have, just to get your rightful property back.  Beautiful
little end-run around your constitutional rights, isn't it?

And, time to move this out of sci.crypt.

No.  The patent process requires disclosure to sufficient degree that
someone competent in the field could reproduce the item.

Technically, they could do this.  Legally, they would be violating the
license they signed with RSADSI, and would be liable for all damages
resulting from the disclosure of trade secret information.  Thereafter,
I believe the algorithm would be in the public domain.

It makes sense to me.  The very nature of a crypto algorithm requires
disclosure in order to gain confidence in its security.  That fits the
patent process to a tee.  I can think of some reasons they might not
patent it:  Perhaps it is not patentable for some reason.  There might
be too much relevant prior art.  Or, perhaps the patent process is
underway, and they want to protect it in the interim.

Indeed so, but this is hard to prove if the program that did the deletions
vanishes in a similar manner....

This has the potential for obstruction as well.  Even worse, refusal to 
turn over pass information to the court might be considered contempt....
I suppose it depends on wether the judge believes you forgot it or not....
How do you think that one might turn out?

Call me paranoid (you'd be right) but I dont trust IDEA entirely on the
key data encryption.  I'd sleep better (in my holding cell?) knowing that
my secret key data had been overwritten a few times with random 0's and 1's.

again:

I just don't see any other really secure way....  Everything else leaves
questions.

I don't mean to encourage obstruction, just point out the requirements of
defeating a well resourced attacker (law enforcement makes the best analogy
just now.)

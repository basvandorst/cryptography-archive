I recently posted a message giving an example of a scheme for registering
documents without revealing them.  Several people have since suggested that
I got the idea from recent work at Bellcore and should therefore have cited
them.

However Li Gong at SRI has just reminded me that I first described the
scheme to him before he moved to the USA in May 1990.  I had envisaged an
on-line repository for these signatures that I called an Electronic Notary.

A similar scheme also appears in a anonymous French submission to ISO later
that year so I know that others discovered it independently of me.

Maybe somebody should start one of these services so that people can register
ideas such as this.  :-)

Before the Internet will invest in software, people need to see content. 
I would suggest that 50 attractive MIME formatted news messages a day would be
sufficient to get a few people thinking about adding MIME support to news
readers, esp if the content is really worth it.

Yes.  But there is also a long way to go before most Mac, PC, and Windows
MUAs and newsreaders are ready to handle the sheer volume of news and mail
that many Unix specific tools are able to cope with.  When the choice is
"more feechurs" or "make the damn thing fast enough to keep up with the
flood", you have to bet that "fast enough" wins.

It is clear, absent a set of circumstances unlikely to occur, we can not
know if this inference is true or false.  The 'model' is consistant with
the available data.  But a large number of other models have the same
strength...  I guess we will have to wait for the time in the far future
when everyone uses such good crypto that the NSA has no job.  Then the
agency will be disbanded and its files opened after the approprate
historical delay.  ;)

Now, does the possibility of that happening add support to the postulated
model?  :)

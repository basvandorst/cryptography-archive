IDEA was invented in Switzerland.  I don't think anyone has asked, but you
can assume it is illegal to export out of the U.S.  (Go figure.)

No.  IDEA is patented, but there is no license fee required for non-
commercial use.  If you are going to use IDEA in a product, contact:
Dr. Dieter Profos, Ascom Tech AG, Solothurn Lab, Postfach 151,
4502 Solothurn, Switzerland.

Xuejia Lai, the inventor of IDEA, believes that the algorithm is not
a group.  Assuming he is right, it does benefit from multiple
encryption.

There are a bunch on the net.  Phil Karn's is particularly nice.  I'm
sure he'll send it to you if you ask nicely.

PGP is the only encryption program that I know of that uses IDEA.  There
are a couple of implementations of IDEA floating around.

IDEA was designed as a way to get a Ph.D.  Well, maybe that's unfair.
IDEA certainly could be a replacement for DES, although there has been
no move in that direction--either by NIST or by industry.

And yes, patents are a barrier to universal acceptance.  But remember,
Luficer was patented by IBM, and they gave everyone the rights to use
it royalty free when it became DES.

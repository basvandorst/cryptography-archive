While this is a common way to fill in the matrix, it is also a very
bad way to fill it in! In particular, the last row is very often
'VWXYZ' and this provides a partial way into the classical playfair.

More elaborate filling in is desirable - almost anything can be used 
that ensures that the run of VWXYZ is broken up.

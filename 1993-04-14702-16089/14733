As the original article seems to have come from the UK it was probably
initiated by an item on BBC 1's Tomorrows Worlds program.  TW is rapidly
becoming a byword for uncritical, poorly presented pseudo-technical
wizkiddery.  The program in question was all about new developments in
security systems - all of which appeared to contain such gaping holes as to
be useless (except possibly the 4 inch carbon steel bolt you pass through a
car's gearbox to immobilize it.) The problem is you never know if the
problem lies with hopelessly ill-educated presenters scripts or with the
products themselves.

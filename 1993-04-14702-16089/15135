And anybody who can get the keys from the escrow company.  This is a
database that's going to take plenty of updating - they think they can
keep it secure?  Please...  and that's just primary, not secondary

be surprised if they just "neglected" to erase the key if it turned
out they couldn't nail you on anything?

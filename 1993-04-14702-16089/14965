The social security number was introduced the Netherlands about ten years ago.
Nowadays a lot of databases are linked together using the SSN.
Unfortunately the privacy laws in the Netherlands are not very strict.
And because of a social security fraud politicians are all shouting to
give up more privacy. This usually is a good way to get re-elected
because the majority of people feel that their tax-money is wasted
because of social security fraud. And the same goes for the rising crime
rate. 

Instead of developing a good social security system where fraud is a lot
harder than it is now and doing something structural about the rising
crime rate, the recent trend in Dutch politics is to give more freedom
to the authorities. Needless to say that this will affect the privacy
situation in the Netherlands. Unfortunately, the "moral" majority (yes,
we have that as well in Holland but it is not very organized) feels that
if you have nothing to hide, why should you bother about privacy.

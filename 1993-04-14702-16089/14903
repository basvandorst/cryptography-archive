   What I meant was that as long as the only advantage of the
   cryptanalyst is a faster computer, then we will probably have RSA for
   a long time to come, because even if 1024-bit moduli somehow could be
   broken with fast computers (not with a new algorithm), then people
   would simply use longer moduli.  Both users and cryptanalysts benefit
   from better technology in the same way.

It's rather more asymmetric than that, for most implementations of
multi-precise arithmetic and for presently known factorization methods.

Roughly speaking (it depends on algorithm) *adding* a few digits to the
size of the modulus increases the factorization time ten-fold, but
*doubling* the number of digits increases the encryption/decryption time
ten-fold.  Faster computers help the users more than the cryptanalysts.

Standard disclaimers about "algorithms in the open literature", "assumes
no radical improvment in factorization", "assumes breaking RSA is as
hard as factorizing", etc, apply.

   Also, if you're dealing with information that you need to be able to encrypt
regularly, but only decrypt on rare occasions, you could generate an RSA key
pair, and then use the encryption key to encrypt data (probably using some
hybrid scheme with a faster symmetric cipher).  You could give some other
person (outside the country, perhaps) a diskette with the decryption key,
encrypted using some password only you know.  Even if you're "broken" and give
away the password, the bad (or good) guys would still have to find the guy with
this disk.  (Ideally, you would know this person or service only through one
or more blinded remailers or something.)  This scheme is somewhat more
resistant to "rubber hose cryptanalysis" than the "I plead the fifth" or
"I forgot the password" schemes.

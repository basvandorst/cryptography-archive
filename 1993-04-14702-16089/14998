I think the judge found it impossible to believe she forgot where she left her
kids ;)  Whereas forgetting a pass pharase or code is much more likely to be
believed :)  (I'v forgotten so many passwords in my life, I almost always get
to know my sysadmins very quickly...)

The stress of having the FBI asking me questions is likely to get me to
forget things...  And there is no requirement to answer their questions.  
(You can decline to answer but if you answer, you can not lie... that's
illegal).  You might be compelled to offer testimony in court and IF the 
judge doesn't believe you forgot your pass phrase/string...the above MIGHT 
happen.

IF I told the judge I forgot where my kids were, that's a whole new kettle 
of fish.

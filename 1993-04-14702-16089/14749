No, for non-commercial purposes. (Importing an IDEA implementation

I assume - no.

I assume - yes. (It depends on whether IDEA is a group. For DES

IDEA is extremely easy to implement. Besides, the paper, describing
IDEA, sort of explains the algorithm down the C language level. (:-)

Well, probably the designers of IDEA had that in mind (:-).

Well, DES is royalty-free for anyone, commercial, or not. IDEA is free
for non-commercials only.  It certainly may impede it's acceptance on
commercial market.   Also, it will take time for the dust to settle,
for now IDEA is too "young" - it's not clear just how strong it is.
Why should you care? There are ways of using DES 100% secure, and
probably same can be done to IDEA... Even plain DES with 56-bit
key isn't all that easy to crack, mind you (:-).

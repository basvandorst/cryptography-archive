	This is incorrect.  RFC 1421 clearly states:

        1.  Data Encrypting Keys (DEKs) are used for encryption of
            message text and (with certain choices among a set of
            alternative algorithms) for computation of message integrity
            check (MIC) quantities.  In the asymmetric key management
            environment, DEKs are also used to encrypt the signed
            representations of MICs in PEM messages to which
            confidentiality has been applied. DEKs are generated
            individually for each transmitted message; no
            predistribution of DEKs is needed to support PEM
            transmission.

        2.  Interchange Keys (IKs) are used to encrypt DEKs for
            transmission within messages.  Ordinarily, the same IK will
            be used for all messages sent from a given originator to a
            given recipient over a period of time.  Each transmitted
            message includes a representation of the DEK(s) used for
            message encryption and/or MIC computation, encrypted under
            an individual IK per named recipient.

RFC 1423 (PEM Algorithms, Modes, and Identifiers) further elaborates on
the cryptographic protocols that a compliant implementation are _required_
to support:

   The RSAEncryption public-key encryption algorithm, defined in PKCS #1
   [11], is used for DEK and MIC encryption when asymmetric key
   management is employed.  The character string "RSA" within a "MIC-
   Info:" or "Key-Info:" header field indicates the use of this
   algorithm.

   All PEM implementations supporting asymmetric key management shall
   support this algorithm.

Thus, we see that a RFC 1421-23 compliant implementation of PEM _must_
utilize RSA encryption of DEK's, something that PKP's patent agreement
with the Internet Activities Board (RFC 1170) does not cover.

>However, if PKP is *NOT* offering the same terms for a patent that's
>part of an ANSI/IEEE standard (proposed), then I would like to know and 
>I will report it back to people at the IEEE.

	PKP has given a license to Mark Riordan (via the RSAREF package)
to make a partially-compliant PEM package, RIPEM, at no cost, and has
repeatedly refused to grant a similar license Phil Zimmerman in his
PGP package.

	Now, suppose I decide to expand the capabilities of PGP to make
it compliant with RFC 1421-23.  Does anybody want to make any bets on
whether PKP will grant me a similar license to distribute my code, under
terms similar to Riordan's?  I didn't think so ....

	BTW, does anybody have the email address of someone at PKP I can
ask for a license, just for completeness?

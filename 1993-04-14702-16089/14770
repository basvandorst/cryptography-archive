PEM specifies how to encrypt messages as well as sign them, using RSA
to encrypt DES session keys in the obvious way.  See RFC's 1113-1115
for details.  (Actually I think these RFC's have been superseded with
newer versions, which are probably mostly the same).  RSAREF has hooks
for encrypting messages as specified by the PEM RFC's.  These are what
RIPEM uses, presumably.

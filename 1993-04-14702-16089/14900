I have a question... :-)

Now that Microsoft Corp. has published the API for DOS 6.0's DoubleSpace
disk compression facility, and 3rd-party vendors are already advertising
improved compressors with hooks into the DOS 6 kernel, does anyone have
an opinion (better yet, specific knowledge) on when we'll see the first
such utilities which implement strong cryptography?

To non-DOS6 users:  MS-DOS 6.0 now has three system files:  IO.SYS,
MSDOS.SYS, and DBLSPACE.BIN, a disk compression driver.  This driver
can be used as-is to provide decent on-the-fly compression, or it can
be replaced with a 3rd-party driver for even better performance (and/or
cryptography, I assume.)  Now that MS has released the API, everyone
and his half-sister are writing utilities to enhance or replace DBLSPACE.
Why not an IDEAZIP.BIN driver?

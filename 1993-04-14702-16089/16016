My father having worked for American Cyanamid for sometime did mention
that the "recipe" is a secret... Neither of us know of just how toxic
the stuff is...but you can synthesize a simliar substance that is
available to just about any organic lab...called Luminol.  You can usually
find this in an organic lab book or something similiar... 

Rumor has it that luminol is some base form for the stuff used in the 
light sticks...

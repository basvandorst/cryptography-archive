No. The ONLY thing that matters for RSA is the size of the key.
[one minor technical nit; repeated encryption attacks can be used if the
lambda function is too big]

This is wrong. The only difference is that it takes more WORK to
exhaustively search a DES 56-bit keyspace than to factor a 384-bit number.
 
The claims you have heard are wrong. Both are breakable with today's 
technology. But 384-bit RSA will be easier.


It has NOTHING to do with distribution of the keyspace.

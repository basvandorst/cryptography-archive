  Suppose a user wants a system's time stamp on a document to
stand up in court although the user had permission to change
the system's clock.  Is there any way to authenticate the time
stamp to respond to the challenge
     "Oh, you just changed the system clock, saved the document,
      and then reset the system clock."   ?

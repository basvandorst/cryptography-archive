Dorothy,

  But in your article, and in online discussions, you many times pointed
to the laws against illegal wiretapping and said "those laws will protect
citizens against illegal taps." But the taps on King and the others *were*
illegal under any wiretapping laws that were in force at the time, which
seems good evidence that we can't count on such laws for protection from
offensive government taps. 

   Here is what you can expect from the government: in Ventura County, CA,
where I live, the LA County Sheriff's Dept. raided a (later shown to be
innocent) rancher's house near Malibu. They broke down his front door, and when
the alarmed rancher appeared  with a gun, they shot & killed him. Their
"probable cause" for obtaining a warrant was spectrographic indications
from an aircraft survey that marijuanna was growing on the rancher's property.
No plants or drugs or contraband or evidence of any crime was ever found.
The rancher, Don Scott, had no record. A subsequent aircraft survey still
showed the same "spectrographic" evidence (never before used to obtain a
warrant). The ranch was in Ventura county, and the warrant was for a non-existant
LA county address. The Ventura county sheriff started an investigation,
as he was never consulted in the raid (as required by law). The investigation,
released today, revealed the LA county sheriff had the ranchers property
assessed before the raid, and had prepared paperwork for asset forfeiture
in anticipation of success. Also today, the LA sherrif's own investigation
conclued the shooting was "justified" because the rancher had a weapon in
his hand when his door was kicked in. Earlier reports, however, said that
the elapsed time between kicking the door in and shooting the rancher was
under five seconds. 

   My point is that the motivations of individuals in government are no
more immune to corruption than anybody's. The system can be manipulated (in
this case, perhaps out of a desire to cash in on an 8-million dollar asset
seizure) to obtain warrants, and such warrants often are executed unsafely,
with devastating results to innocent civilians. You simply cannot trust
the law as a practical restraint against official abuse.

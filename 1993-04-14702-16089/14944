Bill Newell's comments are not representative of the University of Washington.
The opinions he expresses are his personal viewpoints only.

I strongly urge e-mail vendors not to consider his comments as an indication
that the University of Washington has no interest, or only a short-term
limited interest, in MIME.

The University of Washington is strongly committed to MIME as an e-mail
standard.  One of the most important capabilities in the University of
Washington's Pine mailer is its MIME capability, which is strongly oriented
towards file attachment; specifically, the ability to interchange documents,
spreadsheets, etc. from one desktop to another.

We hope to complete our beta test and development of DOS Pine soon; at which
point there will be a very large increase in the MIME usage at the University
of Washington.  It is very important to us that any other e-mail packages in
use at the University and in other state agencies be interoperable with our
MIME infrastructure.

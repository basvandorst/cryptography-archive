Been reading all this biz on verifying your PGP.  Perhaps this is a stupid
question, but do any of you actually HAVE a non-legit copy of PGP?  Have you
EVER encoutered one?  Seems to me this is all being blown out of proportion.
Rather like demanding a finger-print analysis of your mom to make sure no
alien spy with a good plastic surgeon has replaced her in the night...

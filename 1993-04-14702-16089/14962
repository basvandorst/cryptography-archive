I had a look at Da Vinci in about 1989 and it implemented DES in ECB mode.
This meant that you could look at a ciphertext file and immediately see what
block corresponded to eight spaces in the plaintext.

Furthermore, the key is entered as a password of up to 8 ASCII characters
rather than as a passphrase. This makes it even easier to attack than unix
passwords (which at least have salt). All you need to do is use your password
dictionary to encrypt a string of spaces, and sort and store the results in a
table. You will then be able to break any password in your dictionary just as
fast as the table can be read.

This is a classic example of the fact that most cryptosystem failures are due
to errors in implementation or management, rather than to the sophisticated
attacks which dominate the technical literature. Other examples include most
of the known history of military cryptanalysis (see Kahn and Welchman) and 
most known frauds against banking systems (see my previous postings on the
topic of ATMs).

Mind you, it's quite possible that later versions of Da Vinci have had this
problem sorted out.

I hope they sold it to Iraq and North Korea.

In that case, it's quite possible that the problem hasn't been sorted out.

A competitor, such as Lotus?

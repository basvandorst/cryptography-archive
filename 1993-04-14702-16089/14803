What is the legal status of the pen register? My understanding is that
they do not require warrants, unlike wiretaps that acquire the contents
of a communication. In other words, traffic analysis is considered less
invasive than acquiring content.

Perhaps we need the telephony equivalent of an anonymous remailer for
the telephone network? Back in Prohibition days (alcohol, that is) I
understand a device called the "cheesebox" was a popular means to thwart
the tracing of telephone calls. It connected two phone lines in the back
room of an otherwise uninvolved business. It was the conceptual predecessor
of today's anonymous email remailer.

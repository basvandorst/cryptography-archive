I had a sample of a custom-made stick which was designed to be used as
a light source for obstetrig/gynecologic examinations.  The stick has
a double-sided tape backing so that it can be placed on the upper side
of a dilator.  If this application was licenced by the FDA it sounds
like the chemicals inside are safe to humans even if a leak on internal
(semi) organs would happen.  I don't think that this would imply that
its safe for an ob/gyn examination of a shark  ...    :)

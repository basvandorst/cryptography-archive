That is true.  Furthermore, even if the law did require proof, the people
who sit on juries are not qualified to verify a real proof.

That's why it's so very important that we're innocent until proved guilty.

For example, if I had a program on my disk which created totally random
files looking like encrypted messages and could demonstrate that the file
in question *could have been* created by that program, then my claim that
it was, in fact, created by that program must stand as true (since I'm
innocent) unless someone can prove me wrong.

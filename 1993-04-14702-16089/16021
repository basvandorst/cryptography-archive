Here's my problem.  We're going to distribute some disks with award
nominated science fiction on them.  But in the case of two of the
Nebula nominees, we may only be able to get the U.S. rights.

But we don't want to make lots of different versions, an international and
a U.S. one, so I was thinking of encrypting the stories, putting
some decryptors on the disk, and putting a label with the cryptkey
on the copies sold within the USA.   Messy, but not as bad as mastering
two CDs.   The same applies to a Hugo nominee on which the rights will
expire December 31.

I don't need particularly secure crypto.  These aren't secrets I am
protecting, but territories.   So I could probably do something that
a child could break in a cryptographic sense because an aware person
could just wangle a copy of the key, or the original plaintext, from
the USA.

Of course it's also important that the decryptor be exportable even
if the password is not sent and it's not meant to be used.

How about some suggestions from that not very researched area "not
very good cryptography?"  I guess in theory even a plain loop xor
would be sufficient for my needs.  Sadly, the popular archiving programs
are not due to those export rules -- or can one export decryptors on
some of them even if the encryptor is munitions?

While I don't pretend to be an expert in French politics and policy, I
suspect the Socialists would have lost just as badly without the
wiretapping.  Every report I hear puts the blame for the defeat on
France's economy, and unemployment situation.  They had been saying
for past couple of months that this was going to happen, that it would
be a very radical shift.  And they were right.

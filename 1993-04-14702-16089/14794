      Do you have a cite for this?

      Pen registers are obsolete, although the term lives on.
The modern term is "dialed number recorder" (DNR), and it does what you would
think it does; logs the numbers dialed for a phone line to which it is
electrically attached.

      A real pen register is a pre-Touch-Tone device for recording dial
pulses as dashes in ink on a paper tape.  Pre-electronic technology.
1930s?  Based on a Morse inker, a logging device for Morse code.

      Radio Shack used to sell a nice DNR for under $100, with a little
printer.  Plug it into your phone line and you get a log of outgoing calls,
with time, date, and duration.  That's the modern equivalent of a 
"pen register".

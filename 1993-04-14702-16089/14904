No, that's RIPEM... RrrrrIPEM, not TIPEM.  ;-) Interestingly RIPEM
*only* performs full encryption, and not signatures/verification.

You can get the RIPEM sources as well as RSAREF via anon-ftp from
'rsa.com'.  (The RIPEM sources there may be a bit out of date... for
the very latest and greatest you might have to contact the author,
Mark Riordan, "mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu".  Also, check out
alt.security.ripem.)

I was just idly thinking about the best way to keep your data
safe from the government. (assuming a good crypt program and
good password)

Get a 1500 watt UPS and 2 pc's with way 8 MB ram each.

Run dos on each, and have a program running on both that times out
every 24 hours and without the password deletes everything on the ram
disk (which is of course encrypted).  Or even longer, but make it
delete everything with 5 minutes if the keyboard is touched without
password.  (keep it away from cats ;-) )

So if they cut your power everythings gone when the UPS dies, if they
leave it on and you take 24 hours to consult with a lawyer it's gone.
This limits how much cohersion the courts can do (legally anyways)

If the power goes out you can type in the pasword and save it to disk.

The machines could communicate over the serial line to make sure each
is alive if not scream, call your beeper etc.

So the only way to lose your data is 2 hardware problems, a power
outage longer then the UPS (without you around), or if you leave
for 24 hours or more.

Just idle day dreaming I guess.... (where's my aurora blueprints ;-) )

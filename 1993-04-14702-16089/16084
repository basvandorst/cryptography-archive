I'm satisfied with the explanation that Clipper is so good and so hard to
crack without an escrowed key that they don't want to publish it and give it
to our adversaries. My satisfaction is reinforced by their willingess to
allow an expert committee to examine the algorithm under cover of secrecy,
and publish their findings as to its security.

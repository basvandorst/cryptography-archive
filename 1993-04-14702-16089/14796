What does the US system say about a response like "I'm terribly sorry,
chaps, but I can't for the life of me remember what my PGP passphrase
is".

With a physical key, I assume that a warrant requiring keys to be provided
would allow those searching to say "OK, tough, we're going to pick the
locks, or -- alternatively -- smash the bloody door down" if you claimed
to have lost the keys and they couldn't find them. What would the searchers 
be allowed to do, analagously, in the case of a "forgotten" PGP key. 
Assuming they can't crack it, are they allowed to search your brain with
drugs? sleep deprivation? truncheons? Or do they just have to take your
word for it (you're innocent...).

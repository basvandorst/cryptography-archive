Not everyone relishes down-and-dirty flame wars the way many die-hard
netters do.  Some would even propose the heresy that discussions are
more productive without the inclusion of personal attacks.

Sure, Dorothy Denning is going to get toasted whether she participates
or not.  But if she stays away, she doesn't have to listen to the
attacks.  Everyone should have the right to leave the discussion if
they get tired of being flamed.  This should not in itself be interpreted
as indication of some ulterior motive.

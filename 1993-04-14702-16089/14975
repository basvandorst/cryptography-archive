These people aren't doing their jobs and simple legal wiretapping won't
help them. For example: the leading cause of death and visits to the
emergency room, for women ages 15-44 (the majority of the population,
remeber) is domestic violence. It's still a joke to many police
departments. 50% of the women fleeing dangerous lovers don't have a
place to hide, much less expect the police to actually _protect_ them!
How is wire tapping going to address this?

I agree the police should be more efficient, but by that I mean they
should start allocating their resources properly. We aren't safe in our
countries, or our streets, or, for some people, even our homes, and the
FBI wire-tapping proposal won't make us any safer. We'll be giving up
civil liberties for no payoff.

BECAUSE the problem is  _violence_  not people  _talking about violence_.

No, you can maintain separate cryptographic relations with each government
agency or company you deal with.  Zero-knowledge proofs and other 
techniques keep you from revealing extra information which can be used to
cross-reference between agency/company files.

I wouldn't disagree with this!

Forgery is not allowed without physical access to the private key on the
card when creating unforgeable digital signatures.  All transactions can be
given unforgeable electronic timestamps so that even if someone gets your
card, all transactions after the loss can be identified.

(for anybody who wants more info on these crypto systems, look at the
sci.crypt FAQ, and/or grab PGP and read the documentation)

There already esists fairly tamperproof smartcard physical security 
systems, such as those which release small acid packets or burn out all
memory circuits upon tampering attempts.  (I'm not going to claim these
are 100% foolproof, just fairly difficult to counter).

Someone a little more versed in cryptographic implementations might want
to interject here about card dispersal/revocation issues.  These are 
complex, and non-obvious.

I'm 100% against a national identification number.  I am for a national
identification system which sets up _separate_ cryptographic relationships
between an individual and each agency he/she deals with.  I'm arguing that
this will increase personal privacy, if implemented properly.  I'm not
arguing that I'm 100% sure we can trust the government to actually do this,
at least right now with drug and gun warriors.  Just that it _could_ be done.

I think an important point is that as we engage in commerce and relations
with more and more agencies and corporations, we are no longer dealing with
people who know us by face and psychology.  We have all become numbers.
The question is whether we wan to continue to be cross-referencable
numbers, or whether we want to establish a system whereby we are _not_
cross-referencable, and have secure cryptographic relations with these
groups.

All you had to do was tell me I was wrong, I have no problem with that...  I
even said I wasn't sure, since I haven't read the PEM specs in quite a while.

Not quite correct...  PKP has allowed, as I understood from Mark's talk
at the RSA conference a couple of months ago, RIPEM to use RSAREF in
"nonstandard" ways -- ie. the RSAREF license (for free) is only
if you access it a certain way, and they are allowing RIPEM to access
RSAREF in a different way.

At that same conference, and on-line, RSA folks have said that they
would likely allow (or more accurately, would not expect to disallow?)
many other such RSAREF license alterations.  Other people HAVE asked
and received just that.  But, that is NOT what Phil wants to do.  You
are confusing apples and oranges here.  I think that RSA even said
that they don't understand why someone doesn't just ask to use RSAREF
to make a PGP compatible program.

Why not just ask Jim Bidzos...

I understand, btw, that the license that is being offered relative to
PEM (and the RFCs) *IS* for full encryption, not just the signature, and
that there is a chunk of change up front plus a 2-5% royalty and voila,
you can do a fully RFC compliant PEM to your heart's content.  I was
told that they ARE offering the same terms to all comers just as ANSI
and IEEE require.  Again, neither you nor I can afford those terms,
but that doesn't make it wrong...

Sigh.  Many activists use the trick of equivocation to
mislead the stupid.

You can usually tell this trick in discourse just like
your English teacher taught you to recognize metaphor,
the use of 'is'.

"Abortion is murder."
"Communism is evil."
"A vote for Hogworth is a vote for jobs."
"Cryptography is a weapon."

Then when you challenge their obviously false comparisions,
the activist claim "they were just metaphorizing..."

But like a metaphor, in spite of the 'is', they compare
disimilar things.

Yes cryptography is something that can be used in warfare.
So can toilet paper.

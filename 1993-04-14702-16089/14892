This method is part of the ANSI standard X9.17-1985 "Financial Institution
Key Management".  It is defined in chapter 7.2, and is intended for use
in encrypting DES keys and IVs for "Automated Key Distribution".  It's
formal name is "Encryption and Decryption of a Single Key by a Key Pair",
but it is referenced in other standards documents as E-D-E.

That standard says (section 7.2.1): "Key encrypting keys may be a single
DEA key or a DEA key pair.  Key pairs shoud be used where additional
security is needed (e.g., the data protected by the key(s) has a long
security life).  A key pair shall not be encrypted or decrypted using a
single key."

I think this is a Frequently Asked Question.

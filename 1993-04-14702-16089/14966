Playfair (invented by Wheatstone last Century):

Compose a matrix of 25 characters. (i=j)

A B C D E
F G H I K
L M N O P
Q R S T U
V W X Y Z

encrypting:

I am not kidding -> ia mn ot ki dx di ng 
(spaces between words are dropped or changed to x, pairs which contain two
times the same letter like the 'dd' in kidding are splitted by inserting a
'x' between them)
enciphering uses 3 rules:
- if the two letters of the pair are on the same line, the ones right of them
  are taking (wrapping around the matrix if necessary)
  so gh becomes HI, lo becomes MP, and ki becomes FK.
- if the two letters are on the same row: af -> FL, gr -> MW, wb -> BG
- if they are on different lines and rows: take row of first letter, intersect
  with column of second letter, then take colum of first, intersect with row 
  of second. az -> EV, pg -> MK.
deciphering is similar:
just posses the right matrix, then if on same line : shift one to left,
if same row shift one up, if neither just use same step as when encrypting.
(line of first intersected with row of second  etc.)

enciphering 'I am not kidding' thus yields:

ia mn ot ki dx di ng -> FD NO TY FK CY IO MH

which can be written as FDNOT YFKCY IOMHG    (G is a null)

Instead of :
A B C D E
F G H I K
L M N O P
Q R S T U
V W X Y Z

you can use an arbitrary matrix, but the 5x5 case is the common.
The letters in the 5x5 matrix can be arranged in any order you want,
but usually you use a keyword like this: (using 'hindenburg')

HINDE
BURGA (write the keyword horizontally, without repeating letters, and)
CFKLM (fill in the letters in alphabethic order, that are not in the keyword)
OPQST
VWXYZ

(Wheatstone proposed a slightly more difficult method for building the matrix,
which seems not to be used often...)

I hope this helps you,

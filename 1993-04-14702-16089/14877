Beginning with version 0.78 hpack() has included what appears to naive
me to be secure encryption as compared to other archiver programs.  When
encryption is used, by default, the directory info is encrypted along
with the files being stored leaving only a small header to identify the
file.  The option is provided of using a secondary password to encrypt
the directory info so listing of files without extraction permission is
possible.  Two types of encryption are available conventional, and
public key (RSA).  I have heard that the authentication scheme is very
secure and wondered about the security of the archiver's encryption.

Deavours and Kruh ("Machine Cryptography and Modern Cryptanalysis", ISBN
0-89006-161-0) say SIGABA (or ECM Mark II) is based on an idea by Frank
Rowlett, who was one of Friedman's inner circle; the patent was filed by
Friedman and Rowlett.  Deavours and Kruh give a rough description of its
operation (five rotors drawn from a set of ten, carefully selected
pinwheel settings to switch each rotor between active and inactive, and
plugboard to transfer control among the rotors).

They have three pictures of it: outside view, with contact rotors showing,
and with the cover removed showing how the rotors can be changed rapidly.

Beats me.

Don't know.

Again following Deavours and Kruh:  The ECM Mark II (called SIGABA by
the Army) was the US's top-level cipher machine of the 40's.  It was
made possible in time for the war only by cooperation between Navy and
Army, which must make it unique for that reason alone.

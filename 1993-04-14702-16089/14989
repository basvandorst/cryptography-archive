	Does anyone seriously think that things sold openly in computer
	stores can be prevented from being exported?  Talk about unenforceable
	nonsense!  How many thousand of these things are sold?  How many
	thousand just disappear into the mist never to be accounted
	for again?  Governments would be laughable if they didn't cause	
	so much suffering with their inanity.

The old "cheesebox" was the pre-Carterphone version of the "call
diverter."  After the Carterphone decision there were several vendors
that sold call diverters.  I've got a couple in my basement that
were used to redirect my office phone to my home number when I
didn't feel like going into the office.

It'd be quite easy to generate an "anonymous redialer" version of the
call diverter.

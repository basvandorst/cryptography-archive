All I have to say is...yeah, right.  If you're willing to pay them
mucho big bucks and/or use the routines *they* tell you to do.  
Doesn't sound very reasonable to me.

All PKP has to do is give non-commercial PGP users a license.  It's
ok by me to even charge them a few bucks for processing...say $25.  The 
popularity of PGP is enormous, and this could eventually lead to 
commercial products using RSA's patented technology....meaning BIG 
BUCKS for PKP and RSA.  

But I don't guess PKP and RSA are interested in big bucks.  Maybe
they have some other agenda?  Secure communications only for 
government agents, perhaps?

Some limitation.  Let me guess:  don't use the code in any way PKP or
RSA doesn't like....such as...providing secure communications for the
average citizen.

I hope my cynicism is misplaced here.  Go ahead...I'm not afraid to
be wrong every once in a while.  But, I have an uneasy feeling that I
am right.  :(

No, this should say "Those who know and are permitted to talk about it
say Clipper has no back door."

I don't think the NSA gives a crap if they embarrass the President.
In four or eight years, he's out of there, and they will continue on.

You have got to be the most trusting of the government person in the
world.  I suppose you beleive the goverment has never carried out
survelleince of the Soviet Union with planes.  Except of course the
one time Powers was shot down.  And we were never involved in Vietnam
or Cambodia, because Nixon said so.

I imagine a few years back when the government was still denying the
existence of the NSA, you beleived them.  It must have been a great
surprise when such a large organization suddenly sprang into
existence.

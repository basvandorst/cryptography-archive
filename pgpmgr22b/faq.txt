-THE DOS BOX RUNNING PGP DOES NOT CLOSE :

if the DOS box containing PGP runs in Icon and never seems to finish, click on 
the icons property (when the application is running minimized, click in the 
system menu) and uncheck the 'Allways suspended' checkbox in the 'When in 
background' group box. This checkbox tells windows to suspend the application 
when it's running in background, this causes PGP manager to wait forever for 
the DOS box to terminate. However, a 'COMMAND.PIF' file is in PGP managers' 
archive, keep it in your PGP managers' directory.

If this is already done, then maybe you use the PDP Dos version, and if you use the SignFile option in PGP manager, the command line generated might get too long and is truncated before it's given to PGP, I would advise you to use the WIN32 Build of PGP.

    
-UNDER WINDOWS NT, MAPI32.DLL NOT FOUND :

If you run into 'MAPI not loading' problems under windows NT, try copying 
MAPI32.DLL to the directory where PGP Manager resides, it might help, if it 
doesn't, tell me and I'll make a version for NT that doen't load MAPI. This DLL 
should be found, the API PGP manager is linked with is looking for this DLL 
there is nothing I can do about it, maybe it's looking in the Windows\system 
directory when this directory is called system32 on an NT system, try to make a 
system directory and copy the MAPI32.DLL there.

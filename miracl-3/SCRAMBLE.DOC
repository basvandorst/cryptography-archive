                           PC-SCRAMBLER V6.0

             THE STATE OF THE ART IN SECURE COMMUNICATIONS!

Note: This version of PC-SCRAMBLER is incompatible with previous versions.


INTRODUCTION

PC-SCRAMBLER is designed to permit secure communications between two computer 
users, typically both equipped with IBM PCs or compatibles, Hayes compatible 
modems, and identical copies of the PC-SCRAMBLER program. It works best on the 
faster models. 

This program uses a modified version of the 'Exponential Key exchange' method 
to set up a secure communications link. The method uses calculations based on a 
large 512 bit number in the negotiation of the encryption key in such a way as 
to frustrate any intruder, active or passive (e.g. phone tapper). The 
encryption key used exists only in the computer, and only for the duration of 
the link. The user need not remember it or even be aware of it. For more 
details see 'Modern Cryptography' by Gilles Brassard (Springer-Verlag 1988), 
the 'Computer Recreations' column in Scientific American October/November 
1988, or 'The First Ten Years of Public Key Cryptography' by Whitfield Diffie, 
in Proc. IEEE, Vol 76, No 5. pages 560-577; May 1988. The actual method used 
is due to Okamoto, 'Proposal for Identity based Key Distribution Systems', 
Electronics Letters, 20th November 1986, pages 1283-1284. 


HARDWARE CONFIGURATION

Make sure that your PC is connected via either comms port 1 or 2 to a Hayes 
compatible modem. Alternatively the program can be run via a true "null-modem" 
cable directly to another PC. For testing/evaluation  purposes the program may 
also be run in a single-user loop-back mode, without a modem (talking to 
yourself!) by selecting the LOOP option from the COMMS PORT menu (see below). 


SOFTWARE CONFIGURATION

Make sure that the executable file SCRAMBLE.EXE, and the file SCRAMBLE.KST are 
in the current path. See the Appendix for further details of all files 
needed/created by the scrambler program. 


RUNNING THE PROGRAM

Pressing RETURN after the opening screen reveals four main windows. The two on 
the left are associated with the secure two-way communication. The Menu on the 
upper right is now active. Select an option by using the up and down cursor 
keys, and pressing RETURN. Initially you should select the COMMS PORT option 
and tell the program which serial port is connected to the modem. Press ESC to 
return to the main menu. In a similar fashion select your preferred dialling 
mode, Pulse or Tone. You may not have a choice! - some phones are Pulse only. 
Finally select the baud-rate for your communication. This should be the 
highest possible supported by your modem, and by your correspondents modem. 
Read your modem documentation for details. Note that clever modems which have 
built-in data-compression will not perform as well as usual - encrypted data 
cannot be compressed. 

You are now ready to Connect. But first you must make sure to use the 
appropriate operating mode for the modem before selecting 'CONNECT'. 
This is indicated by the tick mark next to one of four possible modes.

For normal Full-Duplex working one modem MUST Originate and the other MUST 
Answer. By selecting AUTO modes, modems that support these features can be 
used with the one in Autoanswer mode left unattended at one end. A user (with 
the Originating modem) can then autodial its number and send files to it. A 
welcoming message from the file scramble.msg will be displayed on the 
autodialler's screen, if such a file exists. 

In Manual modes one user phones the other as usual, and both users then 
progress through the program at their own pace, until each reaches the 'Make 
modem connection' screen. At this point both should press the RETURN key more 
or less simultaneously. If anything the operator of the Originating modem 
should press RETURN first. The first time that you make a connection with a 
new contact it is perhaps wise NOT to immediately replace the hand-set, so 
that if for some reason the modems do not connect, then you will not be 
disconnected. However if all goes well then do replace the handset.

Note that the baud rate established may not be the same as that selected 
above. Modern modems can themselves negotiate the highest compatible baud-rate 
to use and feed this back to the program. PC-SCRAMBLER supports this auto-
detection of the baud-rate. 

To abort any command, press the ESC key. To abort from Autoanswer mode, press 
ESC twice, quickly.

Once communication is established and the key has been negotiated the system 
enters 'chat mode', and the two users can type messages to one another. The 
identity of your correspondent appears in a small window at the top left of 
the screen. Fresh key-strokes appear in normal video, key-strokes successfully 
transmitted appear in inverse video. To force transmission of a line of text, 
press RETURN. Pressing ESC brings up a pop-up menu. To return to voice 
communications, press ESC, lift the hand-set and select QUIT from the pop-up 
menu. The communication may be logged to a file scramble.log, by selecting 
this option from the pop-up menu. Note that logging is the default for an 
autoanswering Scrambler. 

When 'File Transmit' is selected the users can still communicate in 'chat 
mode' to co-ordinate their activities. When 'File Transmit' is initiated by 
one user, a file of the same name will automatically be created to receive the 
arriving data at the other end. If a file of that name should already exist, a 
new temporary filename will be generated and used instead. Files may be 
transmitted securely simultaneously in both directions. If there are a lot of 
files to transmit, first batch them together using a Public Domain Archiver/ 
Compressor. Files may be binary (e.g. executables, digitised images, even 
digitised speech.). If wildcards are used (e.g. *.doc), a pop-up menu appears 
for all files of the requested form, one of which can then be selected. 

Version 6.0 is quite 'minimal' in that it only implements essential features 
required of communications software. During a communication the user can 
enter a DOS shell and use operating system commands, such as DIR (note that 
COMMAND.COM must be in the current path for this to work). The user can then 
return to PC-SCRAMBLER by executing the DOS command EXIT. 


SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

There are two main security requirements in a private two way communication. 
One is secrecy, the other is authentication. To understand these two concepts 
we need to introduce a wily third party - the Intruder. A clever Intruder may 
try many methods to compromise the security of the communication. The passive 
wire-tap is the simplest, and easiest to defend against. An active wire tap 
involves the insertion of bogus data into the communication. Another 
insidious weapon in the Intruder's armoury is the active 'Spoofing' attack, 
where the Intruder physically breaks the communications link and inserts 
himself in the middle, pretending to either or both correspondents that he is 
in fact the other. Remember that while it is easy for us to be sure of our 
correspondents identity merely from the sound of their voices, computers can 
be easily fooled. To protect ourselves Authentication is vital, so that we 
can be sure of the identity of our correspondent.

We can authenticate our identity in three ways. By who we are (finger-prints, 
DNA etc), by what we know (secret password) or by what we have (possession of 
a token of some kind). The last mentioned is the most convenient, and is the 
method used here, although it is vulnerable to a 'cloning' attack. Anyone who 
can create an identical copy of my token can masquerade as me. As all 
Software (and Hardware) manufacturers are acutely aware almost any man-made 
object can be cloned. Software is particularly vulnerable. The ultimate 
solution will be in the form of uncloneable 'Smart-Cards'.

The file scramble.kst contains our identifying information. Registered users 
can create their own scramble.kst files using the KEYIDS program. This will 
create suitable files for everyone who is to be involved in the private 
network. 

Shareware users must be content with the identity 'Your Identity Here', 
contained in the distributed scramble.kst file. Note that no-one can forge a 
new identity from a scramble.kst file. Try it and see, it won't work. 

Note that there is no protection against mindless vandalism! A frustrated 
intruder can simply cut off your phone link, or insert meaningless rubbish. 

We will not attempt here to re-assure you of the security of the method. We 
certainly believe that it is secure, even against well-equipped state 
agencies. Read the literature mentioned above and make up your own mind. It is 
most vulnerable to the above mentioned cloning attack, but in practise this 
can be frustrated by introducing a secret what-I-know component, either by 
starting each communication be exchanging a prearranged piece of dialog, or by 
encrypting, or 'clamping' the scramble.kst file under a secret password. 

The encryption method used impacts the user in three ways. There will be two 
delays while rather large calculations are performed, one before and one just 
after communication is established. Thirdly the speed of the communication may 
be reduced from the quoted modem speed by the overhead of encryption. The 
first two delays can be shortened, and the third obviated, by buying a faster 
PC! But note that the second delay and the slow down in communication are 
dictated by the speed of the slowest of the pair of PCs involved in the 
communication. 


THE DATALINK

Modem links are not perfect - data can get damaged or lost. To prevent this 
from being a problem a 'datalink' is required, which ensures the integrity of 
the data. The datalink implementation uses a proprietary bidirectional sliding 
windows protocol called BIDDY (see comments in datalink.c) and is very 
efficient. The window at the bottom right of the screen provides datalink 
statistics. A lot of time-outs mean that the link has broken down. Many NAKS 
imply a noisy line.  
 

BUT WHY SHOULD I BELIEVE YOU? CHECK OUT THE SOFTWARE YOURSELF.

Unusually full Program source code (excluding third-party libraries!) is 
included with the registered version of this program (in case you don't trust 
us! - In fact it would be VERY inadvisable to use ANY so-called secure 
encryption-based communications software without full access to source code 
and/or the design principles used). Shareware users get all the source code 
EXCEPT for the MIRACL big number routines and associated programs. 

Windowing and low level Communications libraries are by Greenleaf (and highly 
recommended). These libraries insist that your PC is an IBM or else VERY 
compatible. In particular, de-install the mouse if one is present.  The 
executable version of the program was produced using Microsoft C Version 7.0 


REGISTERING

On registration of this product (for IRœ75.00) you will receive the MIRACL big 
number library, with full source code. It will then be possible to create your 
own .kst files, and to set up very private networks of correspondents, each 
with their own unique identifier. This library is interesting in its own right 
- write for details. 

Note that a compatible Atari Portfolio Version of this program is available 
commercially. Enquire to the address below for details.

APPENDIX B - Recent Changes

PC-SCRAMBLER is now modified to prevent a user "talking to himself" (except 
in "loopback" mode), which shouldn't really happen anyway. To accomodate 
Shareware users a second .kst file, DEMO.KST is provided. The second of a pair 
of shareware users should rename this file to SCRAMBLE.KST

In version 6.0 the Pseudo-One-time-pad, has been replaced by a faster and more 
secure method based on the more conventional use of a new block cipher IDEA 
(International Data Encryption Algorithm). See "A Proposal for a new Block 
Encryption Standard", Lai & Massey, Eurocrypt '90, Springer-Verlag 1991.
This block cipher appears to be resistant to Differential Cryptanalysis, which 
has broken many other systems, and is designed to be efficiently implemented 
in software. See also "Markov Ciphers and Differential Cryptanalysis", Lai & 
Massey, Eurocrypt '91, Springer-Verlag 1992. 
 
Another improvement is to continually send small packets of random data when 
the link is otherwise idle. This swamps a phone-tapper with useless 
information, randomises the cipher system, and makes 'chat mode' more 
responsive as every key stroke gets an almost immediate 'piggy-back' ride on 
the outgoing ACK for one of these packets.

The CLAMP utility can now be used to provide password protection for .kst
files. By running CLAMP the file SCRAMBLE.KST can be password protected. It can 
be unprotected via UNCLAMP. If CLAMPed the password must be provided before 
PC-SCRAMBLER will run. CLAMPing in this way defeats a "cloning" attack.
However do not leave Clamped and Unclamped versions of the same .kst files 
lying around. 

The full path is now searched for auxiliary files used by PC-SCRAMBLER. Ensure 
that no other files exist in your path with the same names as those in 
Appendix A.

     (URL=http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/Studios/1059/pgp-    ru.html),
     and The PGP Net (URL=http://www.pgp.net).

   At the page 3, below the authors' names, there is an  addition  (in
   Russian): 'Translated from English and appended by Maksim Otstavnov
   <maksim@volga.net>. Translation Revision 1.0 (September  1,  1997).
   THIS DOCUMENT SHOULD BE DISTRIBUTED EXCLUSIVELY FREE OF CHARGE,  IF
   OTHER IS NOT STATED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER'.

   The body of the document contains no amendments or  additions,  but
   there are ten translator's footnotes (in Russian):

   (#1 - p.7 / 'Dear PGP User!..') 'The existing  public  key  servers
     are available to users world-wide, therefore their infrastructure
     is actually global'.

   (#2 - p.7 / 'Dear PGP User!..') 'The book is already published  [in
     English:] Pretty Good Privacy  5.0  Platform  Independent  Source
     Code. Ed. by Philip R. Zimmermann & Mark H. Weaver. USA: Warthman
     Associates, June 14, 1997'.

   (#3  -  p.14  /  Chapter  2,  Section  'Compatibility  With   Other
     Versions')   'This   [compatibility   issues]    concerns    also
     'international releases' used outside the U.S. borders'.

   (#4  -  p.15  /  Chapter  2,  Section  'Compatibility  With   Other
     Versions') 'Users  of  PGP  2.6.2  are  supposed  to  upgrade  to
     PGPfreeware, Version 5.0; users of 4.0 -- to 4.0.1; users of  4.5
     -- to 4.5.1 (see: [in English]  PGP  5.0  for  Windows  Technical
     FAQ)'.

   (#5 -  p.  15  /  Chapter  2,  Section  'Compatibility  With  Other
     Versions') 'Upgrade of  Version  2.6.xi  used  outside  the  U.S.
     borders is performed in the same way' [as of 2.6.2].

   (#6 - p. 18 / Chapter 2, Section 'Using PGP from the System Tray' )
     'This [pgptray] icon is [in System Tray] if PGPtray  is  included
     in the StartUp menu or launched manually'.

   (#7 - p. 57 / Chapter 5, Section 'Signing  Someone's  Public  Key')
     'In the original - [in English]: 'using your public key'.

   (#8 - p.83 / Chapter 6, Section 'How Does PGP Keeps Track of  Which
     Keys are Valid') 'Unfortunately, the feature' [of  adjusting  the
     program's scepticism] is not provided by Version 5.0 for Windows.

   (# 9 - p.87 / Chapter 6, Section ''Beware of Snake Oil') 'When  ECB
     operation mode [of  DES]  is  used,  equal  blocks  of  plaintext
     produce equal blocks of cyphertext. If a cryptanalyst has a  vast
     amount of cyphertext, the feature can simplify his job. The other
     DES modes of operation provide some form of dependency of a block
     of cyphertext not only on the respective block of  plaintext  and
     key, but also on other blocks of plaintext.'

   (#10 - p. 87 / Chapter 6, Section 'Beware of Snake Oil') 'While the
     book was being translated, DES was broken by  mutual  efforts  of
     participants of a competition run by RSA, Inc.'

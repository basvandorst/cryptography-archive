Features in FIASKO ftpd 1.0 :

MOTD ('message of the day')
     The 'message of the day' will be sent to every anonymous user if the
     file '~ftp/etc/motd' exist.

Disable FTP service
     The FTP service is disabled if the file '/tmp/ftp.lock' exist, however.

Logging anonymous sessions
     Every anonymous session will be logged detailed in '/usr/adm/ftplog'
     (if it exist). Except from this statistical information will be saved
     in '/usr/adm/ftpstat' (if it exist). The columns in '/usr/adm/ftpstat'
     are: Remotehost, date and time, number of miscellaneous operations (RNTO,
     DELE, RMD, MKD, etc.), number of aborted file transfers, number of
     received files, number of sent files, number of sent kilobytes, speed 
     in Kb/sec (only for sent files).

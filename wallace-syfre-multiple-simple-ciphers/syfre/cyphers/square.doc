formal: Cypher square("Square Mod 251", encode, decode, init);


to initialize, construct two tables s[] and r[].
basically, s[i] = i^2 mod 251.  but these entries aren't unique.
so, for the last half (which repeat) we multiply by two, a non-square.
r[] is just the inverse matrix for s[].

store two random bytes.
for each input I: output s[I].
then store two more random bytes at the end.
to undo, you do basically the same thing, using r[] instead of s[].

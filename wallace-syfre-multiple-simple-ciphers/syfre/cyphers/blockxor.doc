formal: Cypher blockxor("Block XOR", encode, decode);


choose four random bytes: a[0..3].  store these first.
break the data into fourths (A[x], B[x], C[x], D[x])
xor the first block with the third, second with the fourth.
xor the third block with the fourth.
then xor each element D[x] with a[x mod 4].
so: A=A+C, B=B+D, C=C+D, D=D+a.
to undo, do exactly the same, in reverse.

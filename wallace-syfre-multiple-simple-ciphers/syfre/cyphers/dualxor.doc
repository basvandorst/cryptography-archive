store four random numbers a[0..3].  let b[i] = (!a[i]) (bitwise negation).
for each pair of entries:
  let a and b be the current entries in the table (we loop thru these).
  read in x and y.  output ((x & a) + (y & b)) and ((y & a) + (x & b)).
undoing it is exactly the same process, amazingly enough.

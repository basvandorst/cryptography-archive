to initialize, construct a table s[].
if [aaaabbbb] is the bit representation of a byte, s[aaaabbbb] = [bbbbaaaa].
so s[] is its own inverse.

store three random bytes.
for each block of 256 input bytes I[]: output O[i] = I[s[i]].
for any extra bytes, just output them.  (lame, I know...)
then store one more random byte at the end.
to undo, you do basically the same thing, since s[s[i]] = i...

construct eight random numbers a[0..7] between 2 and 15.
store them in four bytes.
set curr = 0.
while there's enough input left
  rotate the next block of a[curr] entries right one and output it.
  this sends [a0 a1 a2 .. an] --> [a1 a2 .. an a0].
  increment curr (mod 8) and recurse.
if there's extra input left, just output it.
to undo, you rotate to the left instead.

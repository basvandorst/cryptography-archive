In this directory you will find a large collection of crypto stuff.
Some of the stuff is considered unexportable from the US because of
the US ITAR regulations. This site lies in Finland and is not subject
to any of such restrictions. Please note:

        a - Neither me, nor anybody else from this site breaks
            the US laws by doing the export him/herself.

        b - All the software in this archive is freely available
            (i.e., not commercial. This includes GNU stuff and
            stuff like RSAREF that contains a license allowing
            free distribution).

        c - I by no means want to encourage anybody to break the US
            law, and would like to warn any people tempted to do so,
            that the penalty for breaking ITAR is 41 to 51 months of
            jail time. Of course, if some irresponsible people
            have already broken the law, I could not care less,
            provided that this is not me.

        d - I am respecting the wishes of the authors of the crypto
            programs (i.e. if someone asks me to remove his/her
            program from this archive I will promply honour his
            request).

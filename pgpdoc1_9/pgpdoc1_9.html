<H2>Signing a message</H2>
<P>To sign a plaintext file with your secret key, type:
<PRE>
    pgp -s textfile [-u your_userid]
</PRE>
Note that [brackets] denote an optional field, so don't actually type
real brackets.  
<P>This command produces a signed file called textfile.pgp.  A specific 
example is:
<PRE>
    pgp -s letter.txt -u Bob
</PRE>
This searches your secret key ring file <VAR>secring.pgp</VAR> for any
secret key certificates that contain the string <SAMP>Bob</SAMP> anywhere in
the user ID field.  Your name is Bob, isn't it?  The search is not
case-sensitive.  If it finds a matching secret key, it uses it to sign
the plaintext file <VAR>letter.txt</VAR>, producing a signature file
called <VAR>letter.pgp</VAR>
<P>If you leave off the user ID field, the first key on your secret
key ring is used as the default secret key for your signature.
<P>PGP attempts to compress the message after signing it.  Thus the
signed file will likely be smaller than the original file, which is
useful for archival applications.  However, this renders the file
unreadable to the casual human observer, even if the original message
was ordinary ASCII text.  It would be nice if you could make a signed
file that was still directly readable to a human.  This would be
particularly useful if you want to send a signed message as E-mail.
<P>For signing E-mail messages, where you most likely do want the result
to be human-readable, it is probably most convenient to use the
CLEARSIG feature, explained later.  This allows the signature to be
applied in printable form at the end of the text, and also disables
compression of the text.  This means the text is still human-readable
by the recipient even if the recipient doesn't use PGP to check the
signature.  This is explained in detail in the section entitled
<A HREF="../pgpdoc2/CLEARSIG-enable.html">"CLEARSIG - Enable Signed Messages to be Encapsulated as Clear
  Text"</A>, in the Special Topics
volume.  If you can't wait to read that section of the manual, you can
see how an E-mail message signed this way would look, with this
example:
<PRE>
    pgp -sta message.txt
</PRE>
This would create a signed message in file <VAR>message.asc</VAR>,
comprised of the original text, still human-readable, appended with a
printable ASCII signature certificate, ready to send through an E-mail
system.  This example assumes that you are using the normal settings
for enabling the CLEARSIG flag in the config file.

			  MEDIA ADVISORY

   NIST ANNOUNCES TECHNICAL CORRECTION TO SECURE HASH STANDARD
   -----------------------------------------------------------

     The National Institute of Standards and Technology today
announced it will initiate a technical modification to a computer
security standard used to support the authentication of
electronic messages.  The revision will correct a minor flaw
that government mathematicians discovered in a formula that
underlies the standard.

     The Secure Hash Standard, adopted as a federal information
processing standard (FIPS 180) in May 1993, can be used for
computing a digital signature and remains a highly secure way to
ensure the integrity and authenticity of data used in electronic
mail, electronic funds transfer, software distribution and data
storage applications.  NIST expects that products implementing
the current standard can be used until the technical correction
becomes effective.

     Researchers at the National Security Agency, who developed
the formula and discovered the flaw in a continuing evaluation
process, now believe that although the formula in
FIPS 180 is less secure than originally thought, it is still
extremely reliable as a technical computer security mechanism.
The discovery of this flaw indicates the value of continued
research on existing and new standards.

     The Secure Hash Standard specifies a secure hash algorithm
for computing a condensed representation of a message or data
file.  This 160-bit condensed message "digest" represents the
original message and can be used in computing a digital signature
to authenticate the integrity of the message.  It is highly
probable that any change to the message after it has been signed
will result in a different message digest, and the recipient will
not be able to verify the signature.  Signing the message digest
rather than the whole message usually improves the efficiency of
the digital signature process.

     It is very highly improbable that today's computation
equipment can figure out any message that corresponds to a given
message digest.

     The standard applies to agencies of the federal government
for protecting unclassified information when a secure hash
algorithm is required.  Private and commercial organizations have
been encouraged to use this standard on a voluntary basis.  The
SHS was designed to be used with the proposed Digital Signature
Standard, which is based on the digital signature algorithm and
has not yet been approved.

     As a non-regulatory agency of the Commerce Department's
Technology Administration, NIST promotes U.S. economic growth by
working with industry to develop and apply technology,
measurements and standards.  NIST also is responsible, under the
Computer Security Act of 1987, for developing standards and
guidelines for the cost-effective protection of unclassified
federal computer systems.

revision or fix of the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) released by
NIST on July 11th.

Enclosed is the "technical details sheet" of the
proposed modification that has been floating around NIST for the

Proposed Revision of Federal Information Processing Standard 
(FIPS) 180, Secure Hash Standard

AGENCY: National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), 
Commerce.

ACTION: Notice; Request for comments.

SUMMARY: A revision of Federal Information Processing Standard 
(FIPS) 180, Secure Hash Standard (SHS), is being proposed. This 
proposed revision corrects a technical flaw that made the standard 
less secure than had been thought. The algorithm is still reliable 
as a security mechanism, but the correction returns the SHS 
to the original level of security.

   The SHS produces a 160-bit output called a message digest 
for a message of any size. This message digest can be used with 
FIPS 186, Digital Signature Standard (DSS), to compute a signature 
for the message. The same message digest should be obtained 
by the verifier of the signature when the received version of 
the message is used as input to the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA).

         Proposed Modification of the Secure Hash Algorithm

In Section 7 of [1](page 9), the line which reads

    b) For t=16 to 79 let W(t) = W(t-3) XOR W(t-8) XOR W(t-14) XOR W(t-16).

is to be replaced by

    b) For t=16 to 79 let
                   W(t) = S1( W(t-3) XOR W(t-8) XOR W(t-14) XOR W(t-16) ).

where S1 is a left circular shift by one bit as defined
in Section 3 of [1](page 6), namely

S1(X) = (X<<1) V (X>>31).


ASCII translator's note : S1 is actually,  S superscript 1.
                          W(t-n) is actually, W subscript, t or t-n.

This is a somewhat cleaned-up, debugged version of Britt Yennes
<yenne@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu> ytalk program.  The primary advantages of
it over the talk as shipped with the OS are:

1. It automatically works both with ntalk (the talk & talkd which come
with most UN*Xes including the NeXTs these days) and otalk (only used
by some very conservative UN*X versions like SunOS) as well as ytalk.

2. There is a conferencing mode in which a large number of users can
talk together.  This feature is somewhat limited if not all
participants use ytalk.

3. A number of minor improvements like the ability to save
conversations, do word wrapping a.s.o.

There are still two problems:

1. Ytalk used to trigger a bug in the NS 2.x kernel which invariably
caused kernel panics on exit.  However it appears this bug has been
fixed under 3.0 and I've not had a single ytalk related panic since
upgrading.  So if you want to try ytalk under NS 2.x be sure all your
data is saved and let me know what happens.

2. There is no man page.  Fortunately ytalk is easy to use and
whatever a user needs to know can be found in the original README
file.

Personally, I put 'alias talk=ytalk' in my ~/.zshrc a while ago and
never regretted it.

If you have any questions or problems feel free to email me as well as
the original author.

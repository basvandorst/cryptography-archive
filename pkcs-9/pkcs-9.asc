3. Definitions

For the purposes of this standard, the following definitions
apply.

ASN.1: Abstract Syntax Notation One, as defined in X.208.

Attributes: A type that specifies a set of attributes. Each
attribute contains an attribute type (specified by object
identifier) and one or more attribute values. Some attribute
types are restricted in their definition to have a single
value; others may have multiple values. This type is defined
in PKCS #6, #7, #8, and #10.

CertificationRequestInfo: A type that specifies a subject
name, a public key, and a set of attributes. This type is
defined in PKCS #10.

ExtendedCertificate: A type that consists of an X.509 public-
key certificate and a set of attributes, collectively signed
by the issuer of the X.509 public-key certificate. This type
is defined in PKCS #6.

ContentInfo: A type that specifies content exchanged between
entities. The contentType field, which has type OBJECT
IDENTIFIER, specifies the content type, and the content
field, which has type ANY DEFINED BY contentType, contains
the content value. This type is defined in PKCS #7.

PrivateKeyInfo: A type that specifies a private key and a
set of extended attributes. This type is defined in PKCS #8.

SignerInfo: A type that specifies per-signer information in
the signed-data content type, including a set of attributes
authenticated by the signer, and a set of attributes not
authenticated by the signer. This type is defined in PKCS #7.

DER: Distinguished Encoding Rules for ASN.1, as defined in
X.509, Section 8.7.

UCS: Universal Multiple-Octet Coded Character Set, as
defined in DIS 10646.


4. Symbols and abbreviations

No symbols or abbreviations are defined in this standard.


5. General overview

The following sections specify new attribute types and
object identifiers. This standard exports the various object
identifiers.

New attribute types that are useful in PKCS #6 extended
certificates are electronic-mail address, unstructured name,
and unstructured address. The attributes would be used in
the attributes field of a CertificateWithAttributes value.

New attribute types that are useful in PKCS #7 digitally
signed messages are content type, message digest, signing
time, and countersignature. The attributes would be used in
the authenticatedAttributes and unauthenticatedAttributes
fields of a SignerInfo value.

No new attribute types that are useful in PKCS #8 private-
key information are given.

New attribute types that are useful in PKCS #10
certification requests are challenge password and extended-
certificate attributes. The attributes would be used in the
attributes field of a CertificationRequestInfo value.

Note. The X.520 and X.402 attributes types in Table 1, and
probably several others, might also be helpful in PKCS #6
and PKCS #10.

6. Attribute types

This standard defines nine new attribute types: electronic-
mail address, unstructured name, content type, message
digest, signing time, countersignature, challenge password,
and extended-certificate attributes.


6.1 Electronic-mail address

The electronic-mail address attribute type specifies the
electronic-mail address or addresses of the subject of a
certificate as an unstructured ASCII string. The
interpretation of electronic-mail addresses is intended to
be specified by the issuer of the certificate; no particular
interpretation is required. The electronic-mail address
attribute type is intended for PKCS #6 extended
certificates.

Electronic-mail address attribute values have ASN.1 type
EmailAddress:

EmailAddress ::= IA5String

An electronic-mail address attribute can have multiple
attribute values.

Note. It is likely that other standards bodies overseeing
electronic-mail systems will register electronic-mail
address attribute types specific to their system. The
electronic-mail address attribute type is intended as a
short-term substitute for those specific attribute types.


6.2 Unstructured name

The unstructured-name attribute type specifies the name or
names of the subject of a certificate as an unstructured
ASCII string. The interpretation of the names is intended to
be specified by the issuer of the certificate; no particular
interpretation is required. The unstructured-name attribute
type is intended for PKCS #6 extended certificates.

Unstructured-name attribute values have ASN.1 type
UnstructuredName:

UnstructuredName ::= IA5String

An unstructured-name attribute can have multiple attribute
values.

Note. It is expected that if UCS becomes an ASN.1 type
(e.g., UNIVERSAL STRING), UnstructuredName will become a
CHOICE type:

UnstructuredName ::= CHOICE {
  IA5String, UNIVERSAL STRING }


6.3 Content type

The content-type attribute type specifies the content type
of the ContentInfo value being signed in PKCS #7 digitally
signed data. The content-type attribute type is required if
there are any PKCS #7 authenticated attributes.

Content-type attribute values have ASN.1 type ContentType:

ContentType ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER

A content-type attribute must have a single attribute value.


6.4 Message digest

The message-digest attribute type specifies the message
digest of the contents octets of the DER encoding of the
content field of the ContentInfo value being signed in PKCS
#7 digitally signed data, where the message digest is
computed under the signer's message digest algorithm. The
message-digest attribute type is required if there are any
PKCS #7 authenticated attributes.

Message-digest attribute values have ASN.1 type
MessageDigest:

MessageDigest ::= OCTET STRING

A message-digest attribute must have a single attribute
value.


6.5 Signing time

The signing-time attribute type specifies the time at which
the signer (purportedly) performed the signing process. The
signing-time attribute type is intended for PKCS #7
digitally signed data.

Signing-time attribute values have ASN.1 type SigningTime:

SigningTime ::= UTCTime

A signing-time attribute must have a single attribute value.

Note. No requirement is imposed concerning the correctness
of the signing time, and acceptance of a purported signing
time is a matter of a recipient's discretion. It is
expected, however, that some signers, such as time-stamp
servers, will be trusted implicitly.

6.6 Countersignature

The countersignature attribute type specifies one or more
signatures on the contents octets of the DER encoding of the
encryptedDigest field of a SignerInfo value in PKCS #7
digitally signed data. Thus, the countersignature attribute
type countersigns (signs in serial) another signature. The
countersignature attribute must be an unauthenticated PKCS
#7 attribute; it cannot be an authenticated attribute.

Countersignature attribute values have ASN.1 type
Countersignature:

Countersignature ::= SignerInfo

Countersignature values have the same meaning as SignerInfo
values for ordinary signatures (see Section 9 of PKCS #7),
except that:

     1.   The authenticatedAttributes field must contain a
          message-digest attribute if it contains any other
          attributes, but need not contain a content-type
          attribute, as there is no content type for
          countersignatures.

     2.   The input to the message-digesting process is the
          contents octets of the DER encoding of the
          encryptedDigest field of the SignerInfo value with
          which the attribute is associated.

A countersignature attribute can have multiple attribute
values.


Notes.

     1.   The fact that a countersignature is computed on a
          signature (encrypted digest) means that the
          countersigning process need not know the original
          content input to the signing process. This has
          advantages both in efficiency and in
          confidentiality.

     2.   A countersignature, since it has type SignerInfo,
          can itself contain a countersignature attribute.
          Thus it is possible to construct arbitrarily long
          series of countersignatures.


6.7 Challenge password

The challenge-password attribute type specifies a password
by which an entity may request certificate revocation. The
interpretation of the password is intended to be specified
by the issuer of the certificate; no particular
interpretation is required. The challenge-password attribute
type is intended for PKCS #10 certification requests.

Challenge-password attribute values have ASN.1 type
ChallengePassword:

ChallengePassword ::= CHOICE {
  PrintableString, T61String }

A challenge-password attribute must have a single attribute
value.

Note. It is expected that if UCS becomes an ASN.1 type
(e.g., UNIVERSAL STRING), ChallengePassword will become a
CHOICE type:

ChallengePassword ::= CHOICE {
    PrintableString, T61String, UNIVERSAL STRING }


6.8 Unstructured address

The unstructured-address attribute type specifies the
address or addresses of the subject of a certificate as an
unstructured ASCII or T.61 string. The interpretation of the
addresses is intended to be specified by the issuer of the
certificate; no particular interpretation is required. A
likely interpretation is as an alternative to the X.520
postalAddress attribute type. The unstructured-address
attribute type is intended for PKCS #6 extended certificates
and PKCS #10 certification requests.

Unstructured-address attribute values have ASN.1 type
UnstructuredAddress:

UnstructuredAddress ::= CHOICE {
  PrintableString, T61String }

An unstructured-address attribute can have multiple
attribute values.

Note. T.61's newline character (hexadecimal code 0d) is
recommended as a line separator in multi-line addresses.

It is expected that if UCS becomes an ASN.1 type (e.g.,
UNIVERSAL STRING), UnstructuredAddress will become a CHOICE
type:

UnstructuredAddress ::= CHOICE {
    PrintableString, T61String, UNIVERSAL STRING }


6.9 Extended-certificate attributes

The extended-certificate-attributes attribute type specifies
a set of attributes for a PKCS #6 extended certificate in a
PKCS #10 certification request. (The value of the extended-
certificate-attributes attribute becomes the attributes
field of the requested PKCS #6 extended certificate.)

Extended-certificate-attributes attribute values have ASN.1
type ExtendedCertificateAttributes:

ExtendedCertificateAttributes ::= Attributes

An extended-certificate-attributes attribute must have a
single attribute value. (That value is a set, which itself
may contain multiple values, but there must only be one
set.)


7. Object identifiers

This standard defines 10 object identifiers: pkcs-9,
emailAddress, unstructuredName, contentType, messageDigest,
signingTime, countersignature, challengePassword,
unstructuredAddress, and extendedCertificateAttributes.

The object identifier pkcs-9 identifies this standard.

pkcs-9 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=
  { iso(1) member-body(2) US(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1) 9 }

The object identifiers emailAddress, unstructuredName,
contentType, messageDigest, signingTime, countersignature,
challengePassword, unstructuredAddress, and
extendedCertificateAttributes identify, respectively, the
electronic-mail address, unstructured-name, content-type,
message-digest, signing-time, countersignature, challenge-
password, unstructured-address and extended-certificate-
attributes attribute types.

emailAddress OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { pkcs-9 1 }
unstructuredName OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { pkcs-9 2 }
contentType OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { pkcs-9 3 }
messageDigest OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { pkcs-9 4 }
signingTime OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { pkcs-9 5 }
countersignature OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { pkcs-9 6 }
challengePassword OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { pkcs-9 7 }
unstructuredAddress OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { pkcs-9 8 }
extendedCertificateAttributes OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=
  { pkcs-9 9 }

The object identifiers are intended to be used in the
attributeType field of a value of type Attribute. The
attributeValue field of that type, which has the syntax SET
OF ANY, would have ASN.1 type SET OF EmailAddress,
UnstructuredName, ContentType, MessageDigest, SigningTime,
Countersignature, ChallengePassword, UnstructuredAddress,
and ExtendedCertificateAttributes, respectively.

The content-type, message-digest, signing-time, challenge-
password and extended-certificate-attributes attributes must
have a single attribute value. All other attributes can have
multiple attribute values.

Dear Sci.Crypt'ers:

I recently asked for information of crypt chips. I got a lot of replies --
thanks to all who replied, but I also got many requests to post a summary
of the information that I gathered.

So here it is.

Again, thanks to all the people who helped out.

Sincerely,

In response to your previous post, I'm attaching some (rather 
out-of-date, I'm afraid) information I collected a while ago 
regarding DES chips which you might find of interest.  10 Mbit/sec
is fairly fast -- some of the chips probably can't handle such
great rates and you're definitely beyond the range of typical
DSPs, microcontrollers, etc.

Cheers,
Paul Kocher


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Many thanks to all those who replied to my message -- it seems that
there are quite a few good chips to choose from.  I've made a *very*
brief summary below:

VLSI Technology, Inc.  (Models VM007 and VM009.  They have not returned
                            my calls, so I do not have any information
                            except what Elane Palmer and Ray Berry write.)
Motorola               (Discontinued)
AMD                    (Could not locate model number)
Comtech Labs           (Under development; will support DES, public key, etc
                            on a single programmable chip)
Newbridge Microsystems (Two models available)
Cryptall, Inc          (Apparently have ICs (?), but I have not tried to
                            contact them yet)
Computer Elektronik Infosys  (Chip available and shipping)
DEC                    (Calls not returned yet)


Copies of the replies I received are attached.  I have deleted
a few parts that aren't possibly be of interest to others (such as
requests for this summary, etc) and I have added a few notes in
brackets.

Regards,

Hi...

I caught your letter in Sci.crypt and I might be able to help you.
I'm currently designing a VLSI implementation of DES, so I've got a 
list of helpful papers, if you are interested let me know and I'll dig
them out for you.  Also, if you find out anything about existing designs
I'd be very interested to know - the fastest I've heard of works at a 
rate of about 200Mbits/sec.

Hi...

Somethings about my chip, of the top of my head....

40 pin package (i wanted it to be as cheap as possible)

16 clock cycles to complete 1 block encryption (I have yet to confirm this
figure, i'll be very pleased if I can), so with a clock of 10 MHz => 40 MBits/sec

I've implemented the S-boxes using PLAs

Most of my design is based on the techniques outlined in the paper i last told 
you of "efficient h/w representations of the DES..."

I do use pipelining to give the maximum throughput possible

It has taken me since June to do it all, but that included a lot of work
on the interface, software, and general research as well.  You should be
able to knock out a basic design in the time you've got.

I'm a bit pushed for time at the mo, if you have any specific questions let 
me know.  Also if you have any trouble finding those references...

Thanks a lot for the info you sent me... could you let me know if
that paper you got from Pennsilvenia is any good, if it is i'll mail
the guy who sent it to you.

Thanks,

John

Snagged this from the net last year: 

The 8-bit VM009 data encryption processor provides a complete cryptographic
system on a chip.  Like the earlier VM007, the VM009 contains a hardware
implementation of the US Department of Commerce's Data Encryption Standard
(DES).  The VM009 can encrypt or decrypt data at > 100 Mbps using 64-bit
data words on an 8-bit bus architecture.  The IC's three separate text
ports simultaneously transfer data in and out of the device.  The chip
supports select DES modes of operation, flexible data interfaces, and three
key registers.  Available in 40-lead plastic DIPs and 44-lead PLCCs for
use over the commercial-temperature ranges. VM009, $30 (1000); VM007,
$119 (5000) For info call VLSI Technology at (602) 752-6300.

I am responsible for cryptographic developments at Comtech Labs in
Palo Alto.  We are developing an encryption chip called the 
Programmable Encryption Device (PED).  We will do DES in the 20 - 30
megabit range with the first part and go to higher speeds in the
future.  The chip also includes support for random number generation
message digests and public key cryptography.

We will have PED emulators (boxes that emulate the chip) next quarter
with chips by the end of the year.

If you want a brochure send me an address to mail it to or better yet
come by and pick one up.  Send me some Email or give me a call and
we can go from there.

Newbridge Microsystems has two DES chips available: a WD20C03 compatible
and an AM9568 compatible.  Although most DES chips currently available
are either incapable of running at the speed you require or are 
absurdly expensive, the Newbridge 9568 is fast and supports ECB, CBC and 
CFB in 8 and 1 bit modes. 

Call Gary Heidinger, Product Line Manager at Newbridge Microsystems 
Ottawa, Canada. (613) 592-0714.  (Don't worry... there are no 
import/export issues between Canada and the US). 

If you require custom design of either private or public ICs, then 
Timestep Engineering developed both those chips and many others for
various establishments.  Timestep may be contacted at (613) 820-0024.

Look at Springer LNCS v 809, out this week. It is entitled `Fast Software
Encryption' and contains algorithms which will encrypt with very few instructions
per byte. If you have half decent processors you can encrypt at 10Mbit/sec
in software; the algorithms WAKE (by one of our guys) and SEAL (by IBM) are
both described in this book.

Hope this helps,

Hi Kory!

Are you interested in encryprion/decryption chips
from Russia?
We can sell it - chip LS06C00/10/20.
It is designed in our firm 1 year ago and provide 2 Mbyte/s encryption
in ECB, CBC and CFB modes. Algorithm is Russian federal standard GOST
(may be you heared) - it is like advanced DES (with 256-bit key and
32 rounds instead 16 in DES). This algorithm was property (and secret)
of KGB, but 3 years ago they publushed it for public use.
Some technical data:

- 24-pin ceramic DIL package
- CMOS
- two keys in on-chip WOM (write-only-memory)
- one key can be loaded with decryption by another loaded
- up to 20 Mhz external clock (full static design)
- DC 5v, 12ma at 20 Mhz
- 2 Mbyte (16Mbit) / sec ciphering speed
- 8-bit standard interface (8-bit D bus, R, W, A0, A1, CS signals)
- external interrupt/flags pins

Price of this chip is 120$ in quantities up to 10 (you can buy 1),
95$ up to 100 parts, 75$ up to 300 and 55$ up to 1000.
This price includes UPS shipping to USA.
Quantities up to 10 can be shipped immediately, 1000 - within 14 weeks.

You can ask Bruce Schneier (author of "Applied Cryptography") about GOST
and about these chips - we had some sort of discussion with him..

Regards,
Titov Dmitry

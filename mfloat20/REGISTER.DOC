                                Registration
                                ============


I have changed the registration from MFLOAT Version 1.00 to Version 2.00.

* MFLOAT is shareware.

* Everyone, who is registered for MFLOAT Version 1.00, is registered for
  MFLOAT Version 2.00.

* If you find, that MFLOAT is a good help for you, a registration of US $25
  would be appreciated. If you want to register, send an email and I'll tell
  you via email, what is to do. Other currencies than US $ are possible too.

* If you need higher accuracy you can get a version for 500 mantissa-words
  (2408 digits) for no further fee. Please send an email, and I'll send you
  the code in UU-coded emails.

* If you need the whole source code, it is available for a fee of US $200
  too. Please send an email.

* If you use MFLOAT 2.0 for a program, which you sell or distribute as share-
  ware or freeware or some other distribution channel, it's necessary to
  register MFLOAT 2.0. It's not allowed to distribute the source-code files
  "MFLOATB.C", "MFLOATA.ASM" of MFLOAT 2.0 without a permission of the
  authors. All other files are free.
  Further it's necessary to mention in the handbook or description file or
  in the program, that the program package MFLOAT 2.0 is used for that
  program.
  For example:

  This program uses the library MFLOAT 2.0:

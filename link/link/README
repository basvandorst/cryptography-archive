link encryption program.

this program will encrypt all data between your home computer and
your unix computer.  This is the unix end, you also need a matching
end for your personal computer.  Nothing in the protocol is
unix specific and ends could be written for just about any computer.
To get it up and running:

(1)
cd RSA
make genrsa
genrsa
cp public ../.linkpub
cp secret ../.linkprv

to generate your public and private keys.  You probably only
want to keep one of these keys on each machine (pub on the unix
and priv on the other (more secure) end).

(2)
make

to make the binary

(3)
link

to start the link end, at this time also start the remote
end.  If all goes well, they have compatible public and private
keys, and everything is set up correctly you should be at
a shell prompt and everything you type and receive is being
encrypted over the line.

if you like you could put "exec link" at the end of your .login
or .profile file and as soon as you login link will replace
your shell, and an encrypted shell will come up (after you start
the remote end)

To make a test version:
  Edit the Makefile,  add -DDEBUG and -DSOCKET
  type make
  run link in the background
  run connect in the foreground

this should make a 'link' that listens on a socket, and a 
'connect' that connects out on a socket.  They talk together
over the socket using the protocol.

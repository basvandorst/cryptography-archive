In the ZIP file:
NEWNEWS.EXE		The prototype executable.
NEWSRC			A standard winvn newsrc file.
README			Guess what!

To run the prototype, copy the exe, and any winvn newsrc file into a
directory, and run it.  The program will run without a newsrc file, with
about 10 hardcoded newsgroups.  There is absolutely no attempt made to
connect to anything!  Requires win 3.1.

The program needs a name!  Best ones so far are "Winnows" and "Guppy".
Mail your ideas now - best name receives a free copy :-)

The program reads and parses the newsrc file, and displays the newsgroups
in an "file manager" style expandable hierarchical listbox.  Selecting
"Find" from this window allows you to enter a regular espression, and all
newsgroups that match the expression will be added to the hierarchy.  For
example, entering "comp" would display the entire "comp" hierarchy
(although "^comp\..*" would be more precise:)

The list of "articles" displayed for each newsgroup is nothing more than a
"sample" hierarchical list box, but the same concept will be used to
display threads, allowing then to be collapsed into a single line.

Selecting any "article" will display a single "hard-coded" message,
although the header portions are "correctly" parsed, using regular
expressions, and used in the title bar/status message etc.

Many (most!) of the menu items do not work - they are more to specify the
functionality of the program, and the bits filled in.

The program was written using Microsoft Visual C++ version, and the
Foundation Classes.  It uses GNU regular expressions, and code from the MS
Developers CD for the hierarchical listboxes (adapted to C++).  The code
is available on request, but at this stage, it is hardly worth it!

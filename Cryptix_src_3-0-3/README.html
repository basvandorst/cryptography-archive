<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
This library contains a suite of cryptographic classes for Java.
See the
<a href="doc/index.html">package documentation</a>
for information on the API, as well as the
<a href="FAQ.html">FAQ</a>
for frequently asked questions.

<P>
Cryptix implements the International Java Cryptographic
Extension, a cleanroom version of the early-access
release of JavaSoft's cryptographic environment. This
allows cryptographic extensions -- <i>providers</i> --
to be plugged in by users.

<P>
The IJCE is a clean-room implementation based only on the early-access
specification.  There should be no legal problems with using it freely.

<P>
Cryptix also includes its own provider, including many
popular cryptographic algorithms.

<p>
Version 3.0 is a fairly stable release which reflects the early-access
JCE specification.  The next major change is likely to be a move to
the JCE 1.2 specification.


<h2>Benefits over previous releases of the Cryptix library</h2>

<p>
These general benefits exist with Version 3.0:
<UL>
   <LI>
     Cryptix now provides the standardised JCE interface with
     the inclusion of the IJCE.
   <LI>
     Many new algorithms have been added (see <a href="#algorithms">below</a>
     All of these together, with some support code, form the
     Cryptix Provider.

   <LI>
     There are now 100% Java implementations of all algorithms.

   <LI>
     Native implementations for many message digests and
     ciphers are written, but not yet distributed.
   
   <LI>
     If a native library is installed for a particular algorithm and platform
     (i.e. it is in the <samp>cryptix-lib/bin</samp> directory),
     it can be used automatically in order to improve performance.
     See the
     <code>src/cryptix-lib/Cryptix.properties</code>
     for details.
</UL>
<!-- Pre-compiled libraries are included for
<a href=native/build/x86-win32/>Windows 95/NT</a> (it is also possible to
<a href=native/README.txt>compile for other platforms</a>, but this has
not been tested). -->


<h2><a name="algorithms">Supported algorithms</a></h2>

<P>
In general, Cryptix supports many algorithms.
See <a href="guide/cryptix/Support.html">Supported Algorithms</a>
for the full list, and for the support level of each algorithm.

<P>
With any particular distribution, there will be variations.
See the individual READMEs within the
<a href="README_src.html">source distribution</a>
and
<a href="README_bin.html">binary distribution</a>
for the specific inclusions or exclusions.


<h2><a name="bugs">Bugs</h2>
<P>
Many apparent bugs are installation problems, especially
see points 2, 3, 4 in the
<a href="#install">Installation</a>
instructions below.

<P>
Real bugs are documented in the
<a href="FAQ.html#index_bugs">FAQ</a>,
in the
release READMEs for
  <a href="README_src.html">Source Distribution</a>
and
  <a href="README_bin.html">Binary Distribution</a>,
and on the cryptix-java group.

<P>
Please send bug reports to
<a href="mailto:cryptix-java@systemics.com?subject=Bug ...">
cryptix-java@systemics.com
</a>
<P>
Please include
<UL>
    <LI>the Cryptix version number
    <LI>the type of distribution
	(<i>src</i>, <i>bin</i> or possible <i>doc</i>),
    <LI>your JDK version and supplier,
    <LI>the platform
</UL>
and <i>of course</i>
a description of the problem including exceptions,
output and example programs  as applicable.

<P>
Note that if you are not subscribed, you should do so.
The <i>cryptix-java</i> list is where you will see all
announcements of new versions and bug fixes.  It is
also your channel to the development team.
<P>
<small>
<i>Regardless</i>, if you are not subscribed, send bug reports to
<a href="mailto:bugs@systemics.com?subject=Bug ...">
bugs@systemics.com</a>
and it will be sent to an appropriate Cryptix
Development Team member.  However any reply will be sent to
<i>cryptix-java</i>.

<P>
Bugs are the only thing that we especially look out for,
other mail will probably be ignored, as the list manager
has many other things to do than chase bounced posts and redirect
mail.

<h2>Mailing list</h2>

<p>
A mailing list exists for the users of this library.
This list is currently generating about one post per
day.  It can be joined by sending
<blockquote>

<P>
See the
<a href="FAQ.html#d_mail">FAQ</a>
for more detailed instructions and some variations.

<h2><a name="install">Installation</a></h2>
How to get Cryptix installed and tested.

<OL>
<LI>
  Download and unzip the archive(s) from the
  <a href="http://www.systemics.com/software/cryptix-java/">
  mirror site</a>
  nearest to you
  (you have probably already done this).
  <p>

</LI><P><LI>
  One time only, the Cryptix provider must be installed as a
  valid alternative to the SUN provider.  This change should
  work for all future versions as well, and can be left in place,
  although it will be need to be done for every new release of
  the JDK (or other Java VM) that is installed on your machine.

   <br>
   <b><i>Table 1: Preliminary Preparations to Running Install</i></b>
   </center>

  <P>
  Conduct the preliminary preparations in Table 1
  (you might need to adjust the detail).
  Then run the Install program:
  <pre> 
      java cryptix.provider.Install
  </pre>

  which will add something like:

  <pre>
      # Added by Cryptix-Java installation program:
      security.provider.2=cryptix.provider.Cryptix
  </pre>

  <P>
  at the end of the file <samp>lib/security/java.security</samp>
  in your JDK.  If you don't do this, Java will not be able to find the
  additional provider, and will complain that algorithms are not available,
  for example:

  <pre>
      java.security.NoSuchProviderException: provider Cryptix is not available.
  </pre>
 
  <P>
  The added line says that the 2nd priority provider will be based on
  the class mentioned.  (The 1st priority one can be left as
  the Sun class). If you had already changed your <samp>java.security</samp>
  file, these priority numbers may be different.

  <P>
  Note that on Unix systems, you may have to change the permissions of
  the <samp>java.security</samp> file so that it can be written to (this is
  only needed during installation).
  Consult the administrator of your JDK setup if
  necessary. Changing the file by hand will work just as well as running the
  Install program, if you prefer not to run Java as a privileged user.

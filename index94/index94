``An Improved Public Key Cryptosystem
Secure against Chosen Ciphertext Attacks''
      (revised on 1 August 1994)

ABSTRACT
This short note describes an improvement to the first two
of the three public key cryptosystems proposed by Zheng
and Seberry, which are provably secure against chosen
ciphertext attacks. The improvement removes a shortcoming
with the original cryptosystems, which occurs when they
are used for both confidentiality and sender authentication
purposes.

``Relationships Among Nonlinearity Criteria''

ABSTRACT
An important question in designing cryptographic functions
including substitution boxes (S-boxes) is the relationships
among the various nonlinearity criteria each of which
indicates the strength or weakness of a cryptographic
function against a particular type of cryptanalytic attacks.
In this paper we reveal, for the first time, interesting
connections among the strict avalanche characteristics,
differential characteristics, linear structures and
nonlinearity of quadratic S-boxes.  In addition, we show
that our proof techniques allow us to treat in a unified
fashion all quadratic permutations, regardless of the
underlying construction methods. This greatly simplifies the
proofs for a number of known results on nonlinearity
characteristics of quadratic permutations. As a by-product,
we obtain a negative answer to an open problem regarding
the existence of differentially 2-uniform quadratic
permutations on an even dimensional vector space.

``Flexible Concurrency Control through Nested
Encapsulation in Hermes/ST''

ABSTRACT
The Hermes/ST distributed programming environment
supports the creation of reliable applications through
the use of nested transactions. An important tradeoff
in any transactional system is the amount of parallelism
desired versus the cost of providing that parallelism.
Hermes/ST allows applications to balance the tradeoff
in two ways.  Static multi-granular concurrency control
allows {\em classes\/} to be instantiated with different
granularities of concurrency control. Dynamic multi-granular
concurrency control allows {\em instances\/} to vary their
level of concurrency control during an application's
execution. Both forms of multi-granular concurrency control
are implemented over a nested encapsulation object topology. 

Key Words: concurrency control, granularity,
           encapsulation, transaction, nested

``Pitfalls in Designing Substitution Boxes''

ABSTRACT
Two significant recent advances in cryptanalysis,
namely the differential attack put forward by Biham
and Shamir and the linear attack by Matsui, have had
devastating impact on data encryption algorithms.
An eminent problem that researchers are facing is to
design S-boxes or substitution boxes so that an encryption
algorithm that employs the S-boxes is immune to the attacks.
In this paper we present evidence indicating that
there are many pitfalls on the road to achieve the goal.
In particular, we show that certain types of S-boxes
which are seemly very appealing do not exist. We also
show that, contrary to previous perception, techniques
such as chopping or repeating permutations do not yield  
cryptographically strong S-boxes. In addition, we reveal
an important combinatorial structure associated with certain
quadratic permutations, namely, the difference distribution
table of each differentially 2-uniform quadratic permutation
embodies a Hadamard matrix. As an application of this result,
we show that chopping a differentially 2-uniform quadratic
permutation results in an S-box that is very prone to the
differential cryptanalytic attack.

`` A Quantum Cryptosystem Secure Against 
   Beamsplitting Attacks ''

ABSTRACT
This paper presents a quantum cryptosystem
which is secure against beamsplitting and intercept/resend
attacks. A mixed-state quantum key distribution based on
Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is introduced for forcing
an eavesdropper to use more signal energy in a eavesdropping
process, thus loss of light intensity becomes detectable.
Significantly, such a quantum key distribution allows us
to use higher power photon signal, therefore a longer haul
ciphertext communication becomes possible. In addition,
a novel scheme of beamsplitting attack which was not
known previously is also developed for an eavesdropper 
to extract information. We show that while a previously
proposed quantum key exchange system is suspectable to
the new attack, our system is immune to it.

ABSTRACT
We develop cryptographic protocols for conference key
distribution systems based on the uncertainty principle
in quantum physics. The information theoretical limits
to the system correlation between users are demonstrated
to describe quantum-cryptographically protected multi-user

via ``intercept/resend" for each quantum system is given. 
It is shown that such attacks can be revealed from the
information and correlation formalism.

``The Relationship Between  Propagation Characteristic 
and Nonlinearity of Cryptographic Functions''

ABSTRACT
The nonlinearity of a Boolean function indicates the
minimum distance between the function and all the affine
functions, while the propagation characteristic of a
Boolean function forecasts the avalanche behavior of the
function when some input bits to the function are
complemented. Both nonlinearity and propagation
characteristic are regarded as critical indicators of the
cryptographic strength of a Boolean function.  A main
contribution of this paper is to reveal the relationship
of the two cryptographic criteria. In particular, we prove
that
(1)	if $f$, a Boolean function on $V_{n}$,
	satisfies the propagation criterion with respect to
	all but a subset $\Re$ of vectors in $V_{n}$,
	then the nonlinearity of $f$ satisfies
	$N_{f}\geq 2^{n-1}-2^{\frac{1}{2}(n+t)-1}$,
	where $t$ is the rank of $\Re$, and
(2)	When $|\Re| > 2$, the nonzero vectors in $\Re$
	are linearly dependent.
Furthermore we show that
(3)	if $|\Re| = 2$ then $n$ must be odd 
	and the nonlinearity of $f$ satisfies
	$N_{f}\geq 2^{n-1}-2^{\frac{1}{2}(n-1)}$,
	and if $|\Re| = 4$ then $n$ must be even
	 and the nonlinearity of $f$ satisfies
	$N_{f}\geq 2^{n-1}-2^{\frac{1}{2}n}$.
	In both cases,
	the nonzero vector(s) in $\Re$
	must be linear structure(s) of $f$.
(4)	there exists no function on $V_n$
	such that $|\Re| = 3$.
Combining (3) with results presented in~\cite{SZZ93p},
we conclude that $|\Re| = 2$ (or 4) if and only if 
$f$ is a two-(or four-)repetition of 
a bent function on $V_{n-1}$ (or $V_{n-2}$).

``Quantum Cryptographic Key Distribution Using An Optical Coupler''

ABSTRACT
We develop a quantum cryptographic key distribution protocol
based on two non-commuting quantum states by utilizing an
optical coupler at the receiver side. Each bit of a cryptographic
signal is encoded using quadrature phase amplitudes, which
cannot be simultaneously measured, according to the uncertainty
principle in quantum physics. Quieter light output can be achieved
in comparison to a conventional theoretical model based on
two nonorthogonal quantum states, when a squeezed laser is used
as incident light of the coupler waveguide.

ABSTRACT
The paper analyses components of GOST Russian encryption
algorithm. First general algebraic properties are described
and the GOST algorithm is compared to the DES algorithm.
Avalanche characteristic of the adder used to mix keys
and partial cryptograms is examined. Cyclic shifts used
to diffuse changes of bits is considered.
A part of the secret key in GOST are S-boxes. Later we
show how users can generate S-boxes for the algorithm.
At the end we comment on diffrential cryptanalysis and 
linear cryptanalysis of the GOST.

``Linear Approximation Versus Nonlinearity''

ABSTRACT
Recently Matsui announced an attack on the DES algorithm.
The attack relies on approximation of S-boxes by linear
functions.  To find out the best linear approximation,
Matsui defines the linear approximation tables (LAT)
for S-boxes.  In this work we examine the relation between
Matsui's linear approximation tables and nonlinearities
of corresponding S-boxes.

``A Practical Electronic Voting Protocol Using
  Threshold schemes''

ABSTRACT
The paper presents a novel secret voting scheme which fully
conforms to the requirements of large scale elections.
The participants in the scheme are voters, candidates, an
administrator, and a counter. The scheme uses threshold encryption
to preserve the privacy and accuracy of the votes against dishonesty
of voters, candidates, the administrator, and the counter.
It also ensures verifiability, fairness, and soundness of the
voting process and hence neither administrator nor
candidates, or the counter is capable top produce false tally,
affecting the voting result, or corrupting/disrupting the election.

``GAC --- the Criterion for Global Avalanche Characteristics
of Cryptographic Functions''

ABSTRACT
We show that some widely accepted criteria for cryptographic
Boolean functions, including the strict avalanche criterion (SAC)
and the propagation criterion, have various limitations in 
capturing properties of vital importance to cryptographic
algorithms, and propose a new criterion called GAC to measure
the global avalanche characteristics of cryptographic functions.
We also introduce two indicators related to the new criterion,
one forecasts the {\em sum-of-squares\/} while the other
the {\em absolute\/} avalanche characteristics of a function. 
Lower and upper bounds on the two indicators are derived,
and two methods are presented to construct cryptographic
functions that achieve nearly optimal global avalanche
characteristics.

``Characterizing the Structures of Highly Nonlinear
Cryptographic Functions''

ABSTRACT
This paper studies the properties and constructions of nonlinear
functions, which are a core component of cryptographic primitives
including data encryption algorithms and one-way hash functions.
A main contribution of this paper is to reveal the relationship
between nonlinearity and propagation characteristic, two
critical indicators of the cryptographic strength of a Boolean
function.  In particular, we prove that
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(i)] if $f$, a Boolean function on $V_{n}$,
	satisfies the propagation criterion with respect to
	all but a subset $\Re$ of vectors in $V_{n}$,
	then the nonlinearity of $f$ satisfies
	$N_{f}\geq 2^{n-1}-2^{\frac{1}{2}(n+t)-1}$,
	where $t$ is the rank of $\Re$, and
\item[(ii)] When $|\Re| > 2$, the nonzero vectors in $\Re$
	are linearly dependent.
\end{enumerate}
Furthermore we show that
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(iii)] if $|\Re| = 2$ then $n$ must be odd,
	the nonlinearity of $f$ satisfies
	$N_{f}=2^{n-1}-2^{\frac{1}{2}(n-1)}$,
	and the nonzero vector in $\Re$
	must be a linear structure of $f$.
\item[(iv)] there exists no function on $V_n$
	 such that $|\Re| = 3$.
\item[(v)] if $|\Re| = 4$ then $n$ must be even,
	the nonlinearity of $f$ satisfies
	$N_{f}=2^{n-1}-2^{\frac{1}{2}n}$,
	and the nonzero vectors in $\Re$
	must be linear structures of $f$.
\item[(vi)] if $|\Re| = 5$ then $n$ must be odd,
	the nonlinearity of $f$ is
	$N_{f} = 2^{n-1}-2^{\frac{1}{2}(n-1)}$,
	the four nonzero vectors in $\Re$,
	denoted by
	$\beta_{1}$, $\beta_{2}$, $\beta_{3}$ and $\beta_{4}$, 
	are related by the equation 
	$\beta_{1}\oplus \beta_{2}\oplus \beta_{3}\oplus \beta_{4}=0$,
	and {\em none\/} of the four vectors is
	a linear structure of $f$. 
\item[(vii)] there exists no function on $V_n$
	 such that $|\Re| = 6$.
\end{enumerate}
We also discuss the structures of functions with $|\Re| = 2,4,5$.
In particular we show that these functions have close
relationships with bent functions, and can be easily
constructed from the latter.

``Network Security Issues Case Study: Secure Talk''

ABSTRACT
As technology rapidly changes and computers become ever more
prevalent network security with the associated problems of 
authentication, privacy and data integrity become more of a focus. 
The authentication problem involves or establishes that an
identity of a party usually another user is indeed genuine.
These problems of security involve issues such as channel
monitoring as well as interception and modification of data by
unauthorized parties. Along with various other solutions to the
above problems, a case study looking at the Secure Talk program
together with an examination of some other alternatives is included. 

Secure Talk is a means of achieving secure communication 
through authentication and encryption and as a possible
implementation of some of the ideas proposed to solve the
authentication, privacy and data integrity problems.
  
Finally a discussion of the issues is included with regard to
the problems and solutions presented with various suggestions
being made based on this examination.

``A Cryptographic Solution to Discretionary Access Control
in Structurally Object-Oriented Databases''

ABSTRACT
A new approach to the discretionary access control in
structurally object-oriented databases is suggested.
The approach is based on the use of pseudo-random functions
and sibling intractable functions, rather than on the
traditional access control list associated with each class.
The advantage of this approach is that each class in the
hierarchy of a complex object class can be associated with 
one access key such that it can be directly accessed by its
ancestor without the need to pass through any intermediate
classes. The security model depends on the difficulty of
predicting the output of pseudo-random functions and on
finding extra sibling collisions for the sibling intractable
function.

``On the Automation of GNY Logic''

Abstract:
The Gong, Needham and Yahalom (GNY) logic is a belief-based
logic for analyzing cryptographic protocols.  It offers
significant advantages over its predecessor, the Burrows,
Abadi and Needham (BAN) logic, which has been successful in
formally discovering flaws and redundancies in several
well-known protocols. Manual analysis of protocols using the 
GNY logic, however, is cumbersome, as the logic has a large
set of inference rules.

This report proposes a modified GNY logic, and describes the 
implementation of a protocol analysis tool based on that logic. 
The modifications are introduced to ensure that the logical
statements derivable from a given protocol are all deducible
in a finite number of steps.  The nature of the modifications
is such that no useful inferences are lost.  The tool offers
a facility to automatically generate proofs of protocol goals.
It also generates a logical description of the state attained
after every protocol step, thus allowing the stepwise
development of protocols.  The tool has proved useful in
mechanically verifying the need for several inference rules 
which are absent from the original GNY logic.

Keywords: Cryptographic logics, protocol verification, protocol
security, authentication protocols, key distribution protocols.

``An Application of Hamiltonian Neurodynamics
Using Pontryagin's Maximum (Minimum) Principle''

ABSTRACT
Hamiltonians can generate Artificial Neural Dynamical systems
dependent on time. Classical methods from optimal control theory,
notably Pontryagin's Maximum (Minimum) principle( PMP ) can be
employed, together with Hamiltonians, to determine the optimal
system weights. Today, although several extended-backpropagation
methods using optimization theory have been developed based on
the well known standard back-propagation method ( SBP ),
multilayered feedfoward neural networks are here employed on
differential equations which have characteristics such as admitting
neurons and weight vectors dependent on time. It is shown that the
new learning rule obtained by weight equations using PMP compares
favourably with SBP. The new learning rule can also be applied to
feedback networks, in both continuous-time and discrete-time.

``On Nonlinear Resilient Functions''
ABSTRACT
This paper studies resilient functions which have applications in
fault-tolerant distributed computing, quantum cryptographic key
distribution and random sequence generation for stream ciphers.
We present a number of methods for synthesizing resilient functions.
An interesting aspect of these methods is that they are applicable to 
both linear and nonlinear resilient functions. Our second major
contribution is to show that every linear resilient function
can be transformed into a large number of nonlinear resilient
functions with the same parameters.  As a result, we obtain 
resilient functions that are highly nonlinear and have a high
algebraic degree.

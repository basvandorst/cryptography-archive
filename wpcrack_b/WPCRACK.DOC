WPCRACK recovers the password from a password protected Word Perfect file.

Usage:  WPCRACK <protected file> [<most common character>]

   The most common character in the original (unprotected) file may be entered
   as a decimal value.  It defaults to 0.  If 0 doesn't work, try 32 (ASCII
   space).

Example: WPCRACK C:\WP51\CIPHERED

<H2>Export Controls</H2>
<P>The U.S. Government has made it illegal in most cases to export good
cryptographic technology, and that may include PGP.  They regard this
kind of software just like they regard munitions.  This is determined
not by legislation, but by administrative policies of the State
Department, Defense Department and Commerce Department.
<P>The U.S. Government is using export restrictions as a means of
suppressing both domestic and foreign availability of cryptographic
technology.  In particular, it is trying to suppress the emergence of
an international standard for cryptographic protocols, until it can
establish the Escrowed Encryption Standard (the Clipper chip) as the
dominant standard.
<P>Any export restrictions on PGP are imposed by the US Government. 
This does not imply that I or MIT agree with these restrictions.  We
just comply with them.  We do not impose additional licensing
restrictions of our own on the use of PGP outside of the US, other
than those restrictions that already apply inside the US.  PGP may be
subject to export controls.  Anyone wishing to export it should first
consult the State Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls.
<P>I will not export this software out of the US or Canada in cases when
it is illegal to do so under US controls, and I urge other people not
to export it on their own.  If you live outside the US or Canada, I
urge you not to violate US export laws by getting any version of PGP
in a way that violates those laws.  Since thousands of domestic users
got the first version after its initial publication, it somehow
leaked out of the US and spread itself widely abroad, like dandelion
seeds blowing in the wind.
<P>Starting with PGP version 2.0 through version 2.3a, the release point
of the software has been outside the US, on publicly-accessible
computers in Europe.  Each release was electronically sent back into
the US and posted on publicly-accessible computers in the US by PGP
privacy activists in foreign countries.  There are some restrictions
in the US regarding the import of munitions, but I'm not aware of any
cases where this was ever enforced for importing cryptographic
software into the US.  I imagine that a legal action of that type
would be quite a spectacle of controversy.
<P>ViaCrypt PGP is sold in the United States and Canada and is not for
export.  The following language was supplied by the US Government to
ViaCrypt for inclusion in the ViaCrypt PGP documentation:  "PGP" is
export restricted by the Office of Export Administration, United
States Department of Commerce and the Offices of Defense Trade
Controls and Munitions Control, United States Department of State. 
PGP cannot be exported or reexported, directly or indirectly, (a)
without all export or reexport licenses and governmental approvals
required by any applicable laws, or (b) in violation of any
prohibition against the export or reexport of any part of PGP.  The
Government may take the position that the freeware PGP versions are
also subject to those controls.
<P>The freeware PGP versions 2.5 and 2.6 were released through a posting
on a controlled FTP site maintained by MIT.  This site has
restrictions and limitations which have been used on other FTP sites
to comply with export control requirements with respect to other
encryption software such as Kerberos and software from RSA Data
Security, Inc.  I urge you not to do anything which would weaken
those controls or facilitate any improper export of PGP.
<P>Although PGP has become a worldwide de facto standard for E-mail
encryption, and is widely available overseas, I still get calls from
people outside the US who ask me if it is legal to use it in their
own country, for versions that are already available there.  Please
don't contact me to ask me if it is legal to use PGP in your country
if you live outside the US.  That question is not up to me.  I've got
enough legal problems of my own with export control issues, without
getting involved in giving you legal advice over my phone.  It might
even put me at some legal risk to simply answer a question like that
for a foreigner.  If this question concerns you, ask someone else,
like a lawyer.
<P>You may have a need to use PGP in a commercial application outside
the US or Canada.  Unfortunately, at the time of this writing, there
is no current commercial source for PGP outside the US or Canada.  I
am trying to find a US-legal way to make a commercially licensed
version available abroad, but right now the US export restrictions
make that difficult without putting me at legal risk.  This situation
may change.
<P>Some foreign governments impose serious penalties on anyone inside
their country for merely using encrypted communications.  In some
countries they might even shoot you for that.  But if you live in
that kind of country, perhaps you need PGP even more.

<H3>BAKRING: filename for backup secret keyring</H3>
<P>Default setting:  <CODE>BAKRING = ""</CODE>
<P>All of the key certification that PGP does on your public key ring
ultimately depends on your own ultimately-trusted public key (or
keys).  To detect any tampering of your public key ring, PGP must
check that your own key has not been tampered with.  To do this, PGP
must compare your public key against a backup copy of your secret key
on some tamper-resistant media, such as a write-protected floppy
disk.  A secret key contains all the information that your public key
has, plus some secret components.  This means PGP can check your
public key against a backup copy of your secret key.
<P>The configuration parameter BAKRING specifies what pathname to use for
PGP's trusted backup copy of your secret key ring.  On MSDOS, you
could set it to <VAR>a:\secring.pgp</VAR> to point it at a
write-protected backup copy of your secret key ring on your floppy
drive.  This check is performed only when you execute the PGP <KBD>-kc</KBD>
option to check your whole public key ring.
<P>If BAKRING is not defined, PGP will not check your own key against
any backup copy.

  Keys from Tampering"</A>
and <A HREF="../pgpdoc1/how-does-pgp-keep-track.html">"How Does PGP Keep Track of Which Keys are
  Valid?"</A> in the Essential

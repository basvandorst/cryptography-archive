<H3>NOMANUAL: let PGP generate keys without the manual</H3>
<P>Default Setting:  <CODE>NOMANUAL = off</CODE>
<P>It is important that the freeware version of PGP not be distributed
without the user documentation, which normally comes with it in the
standard release package.  This manual contains important information
for using PGP, as well as important legal notices.  But some people
have distributed previous versions of PGP without the manual, causing
a lot of problems for a lot of people who get it.  To discourage the
distribution of PGP without the required documentation, PGP has been
changed to require the PGP User's Guide to be found somewhere on your
computer (like in your PGP directory) before PGP will let you generate
a key pair.  However, some users like to use PGP on tiny palmtop
computers with limited storage capacity, so they like to run PGP
without the documentation present on their systems.  To satisfy these
users, PGP can be made to relax its requirement that the manual be
present, by enabling the NOMANUAL flag on the command line during key
generation, like so:
<PRE>
    pgp -kg +nomanual
</PRE>
The NOMANUAL flag can only be set on the command line, not in the
config file.  Since you must read this manual to learn how to enable
this simple override feature, I hope this will still be effective in
discouraging the distribution of PGP without the manual.
<P>Some people may object to PGP insisting on finding the manual
somewhere in the neighborhood to generate a key.  They bristle
against this seemingly authoritarian attitude.  Some people have even
modified PGP to defeat this feature, and redistributed their hotwired
version to others.  That creates problems for me.  Before I added
this feature, there were maimed versions of the PGP distribution
package floating around that lacked the manual.  One of them was
uploaded to Compuserve, and was distributed to countless users who
called me on the phone to ask me why such a complicated program had
no manual.  It spread out to BBS systems around the country.  And a
freeware distributor got hold of the package from Compuserve and
enshrined it on CD-ROM, distributing thousands of copies without the
manual.  What a mess.

<H2>Philip Zimmermann's Legal Situation</H2>
<P>At the time of this writing, I am the target of a US Customs criminal
investigation in the Northern District of California.  A criminal
investigation is not a civil lawsuit.  Civil lawsuits do not involve
prison terms.  My defense attorney has been told by the Assistant US
Attorney that the area of law of interest to the investigation has to
do with the export controls on encryption software.  The federal
mandatory sentencing guidelines for this offense are 41 to 51 months
in a federal prison.  US Customs appears to be taking the position
that electronic domestic publication of encryption software is the
same as exporting it.  The prosecutor has issued a number of federal
grand jury subpoenas.  It may be months before a decision is reached
on whether to seek indictment.  This situation may change at any
time, so this description may be out of date by the time you read
it.  Watch the news for further developments.  If I am indicted and
this goes to trial, it will be a major test case.
<P>I have a legal defense fund set up for this case.  So far, no other
organization is doing the fundraising for me, so I am depending on
people like you to contribute directly to this cause.  If you care
about the future of your civil liberties in the information age, then
perhaps you will care about this case.  The legal fees are expensive,
the meter is running, and I need your help.  The fund is run by my
lead defense attorney, Phil Dubois, here in Boulder.  Please send
your contributions to:
<PRE>
   Philip L. Dubois, Lawyer
   2305 Broadway
   Boulder, Colorado 80304 USA
   Phone (303) 444-3885
   E-mail:  dubois@csn.org
</PRE>
You can also phone in your donation and put it on Mastercard or Visa.
If you want to be really cool, you can use Internet E-mail to send in
your contribution, encrypting your message with PGP so that no one
can intercept your credit card number.  Include in your E-mail
message your Mastercard or Visa number, expiration date, name on the
card, and amount of donation.  Then sign it with your own key and
encrypt it with Phil Dubois's public key (his key is included in the
standard PGP distribution package, in the <VAR>keys.asc</VAR> file).  Put a
note on the subject line that this is a donation to my legal defense
fund, so that Mr. Dubois will decrypt it promptly.  Please don't send
a lot of casual encrypted E-mail to him -- I'd rather he use his
valuable time to work on my case.

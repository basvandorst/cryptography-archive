<H2>Cryptanalysis</H2>
<P>An expensive and formidable cryptanalytic attack could possibly be
mounted by someone with vast supercomputer resources, such as a
Government intelligence agency.  They might crack your RSA key by
using some new secret factoring breakthrough.  Perhaps so, but it is
noteworthy that the US Government trusts the RSA algorithm enough in
some cases to use it to protect its own nuclear weapons, according to
Ron Rivest.  And civilian academia has been intensively attacking it
without success since 1978. 
<P>Perhaps the Government has some classified methods of cracking the
IDEA(tm) conventional encryption algorithm used in PGP.
This is every cryptographer's worst nightmare.  There can be no
absolute security guarantees in practical cryptographic
implementations.
<P>Still, some optimism seems justified.  The IDEA algorithm's designers
are among the best cryptographers in Europe.  It has had extensive
security analysis and peer review from some of the best cryptanalysts
in the unclassified world.  It appears to have some design advantages
over the DES in withstanding differential and linear cryptanalysis,
which have both been used to crack the DES.  
<P>Besides, even if this algorithm has some subtle unknown weaknesses,
PGP compresses the plaintext before encryption, which should greatly
reduce those weaknesses.  The computational workload to crack it is
likely to be much more expensive than the value of the message.
<P>If your situation justifies worrying about very formidable attacks of
this caliber, then perhaps you should contact a data security
consultant for some customized data security approaches tailored to
your special needs.  Boulder Software Engineering, whose address and
phone are given at the end of this document, can provide such
services.
<P>In summary, without good cryptographic protection of your data
communications, it may have been practically effortless and perhaps
even routine for an opponent to intercept your messages, especially
those sent through a modem or E-mail system.  If you use PGP and
follow reasonable precautions, the attacker will have to expend far
more effort and expense to violate your privacy. 
<P>If you protect yourself against the simplest attacks, and you feel
confident that your privacy is not going to be violated by a
determined and highly resourceful attacker, then you'll probably be
safe using PGP.  PGP gives you Pretty Good Privacy.

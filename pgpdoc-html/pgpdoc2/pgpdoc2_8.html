<H2>Leaving no traces of plaintext on the disk</H2>
<P>After PGP makes a ciphertext file for you, you can have PGP
automatically overwrite the plaintext file and delete it, leaving no
trace of plaintext on the disk so that no one can recover it later
using a disk block scanning utility.  This is useful if the plaintext
file contains sensitive information that you don't want to keep
around.
<P>To wipe out the plaintext file after producing the ciphertext file,
just add the <KBD>w</KBD> (wipe) option when encrypting or signing a
message, like so:
<PRE>
    pgp -esw message.txt her_userid
</PRE>
This example creates the ciphertext file <VAR>message.pgp</VAR>, and the
plaintext file <VAR>message.txt</VAR> is destroyed beyond recovery.
<P>Obviously, you should be careful with this option.  Also note that
this will not wipe out any fragments of plaintext that your word
processor might have created on the disk while you were editing the
message before running PGP.  Most word processors create backup
files, scratch files, or both.  Also, it overwrites the file only
once, which is enough to thwart conventional disk recovery efforts,
but not enough to withstand a determined and sophisticated effort to
recover the faint magnetic traces of the data using special disk
recovery hardware.

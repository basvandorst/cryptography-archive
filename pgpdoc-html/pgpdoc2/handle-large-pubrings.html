<H2>Handling large public keyrings</H2>
<P>PGP was originally designed for handling small personal keyrings for
keeping all your friends on, like a personal rolodex.  A couple
hundred keys is a reasonable size for such a keyring.  But as PGP has
become more popular, people are now trying to add other large
keyrings to their own keyring.  Sometimes this involves adding
thousands of keys to your keyring.  PGP, in its present form, cannot
perform this operation in a reasonable period of time, while you wait
at your keyboard.  Not for huge keyrings.
<P>You may want to add a huge "imported" keyring to your own keyring,
because you are only interested in a few dozen keys on the bigger
keyring you are bringing in.  If that's all you want from the other
keyring, it would be more efficient if you extract the few keys you
need from the big foreign keyring, and then add just these few keys to
your own keyring.  Use the <KBD>-kx</KBD> command to extract them from the
foreign keyring, specifying the keyring name on the command line.
Then add these extracted keys to your own keyring.
<P>The real solution is to improve PGP to use advanced database
techniques to manage large keyrings efficiently.  We are working on
this, and should have it done Real Soon Now.  Until this happens, you
will just have to use smaller keyrings, or be patient.

<H2>Viruses and trojan horses</H2>
<P>Another attack could involve a specially-tailored hostile computer
virus or worm that might infect PGP or your operating system.  This
hypothetical virus could be designed to capture your pass phrase or
secret key or deciphered messages, and covertly write the captured
information to a file or send it through a network to the virus's
owner.  Or it might alter PGP's behavior so that signatures are not
properly checked.  This attack is cheaper than cryptanalytic attacks.
<P>Defending against this falls under the category of defending against
viral infection generally.  There are some moderately capable
anti-viral products commercially available, and there are hygienic
procedures to follow that can greatly reduce the chances of viral
infection.  A complete treatment of anti-viral and anti-worm
countermeasures is beyond the scope of this document.  PGP has no
defenses against viruses, and assumes your own personal computer is a
trustworthy execution environment.  If such a virus or worm actually
appeared, hopefully word would soon get around warning everyone.  
<P>Another similar attack involves someone creating a clever imitation
of PGP that behaves like PGP in most respects, but doesn't work the
way it's supposed to.  For example, it might be deliberately crippled
to not check signatures properly, allowing bogus key certificates to
be accepted.  This "Trojan horse" version of PGP is not hard for an
attacker to create, because PGP source code is widely available, so
anyone could modify the source code and produce a lobotomized zombie
imitation PGP that looks real but does the bidding of its diabolical
master.  This Trojan horse version of PGP could then be widely
circulated, claiming to be from me.  How insidious.
<P>You should make an effort to get your copy of PGP from a reliable
source, whatever that means.  Or perhaps from more than one
independent source, and compare them with a file comparison utility.
<P>There are other ways to check PGP for tampering, using digital
signatures.  If someone you trust signs the executable version of PGP,
vouching for the fact that it has not been infected or tampered with,
you can be reasonably sure that you have a good copy.  You could use
an earlier trusted version of PGP to check the signature on a later
suspect version of PGP.  But this will not help at all if
your operating system is infected, nor will it detect if your original
copy of PGP.EXE has been maliciously altered in such a way as to
compromise its own ability to check signatures.  This test also
assumes that you have a good trusted copy of the public key that you
use to check the signature on the PGP executable.
<P>I recommend you not trust your copy of PGP unless it was originally
distributed by MIT or ViaCrypt, or unless it comes with a digitally
signed endorsement from me.  Every new version comes with one or more
digital signatures in the distribution package, signed by the
originator of that release package.  This is usually someone
representing MIT or ViaCrypt, or whoever released that version. 
Check the signatures on the version that you get.  I have actually
seen several bogus versions of PGP distribution packages, even from
apparantly reliable freeware distribution channels such as CD-ROM
distributors and Compuserve.  Always check the signature when you get
a new version.

<P>In the USA, PGP is available for free from the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, under the restrictions described above.
<P>The primary release site for PGP is the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, at their FTP site <I>net-dist.mit.edu</I>, in the /pub/PGP
directory.  You may obtain free copies or updates to PGP from this
site, or any other Internet FTP site or BBS that PGP has spread to.
Don't ask me for a copy directly from me, especially if you live
outside the US or Canada.  I recommend that you not use any modified
version of PGP that comes from any other source, other than MIT,
ViaCrypt, or me, unless it is accompanied by a signed endorsement
from me personally.  You can get the official release software from
many other distribution sites "downstream" from MIT.  Hopefully, all
these other sites are adhering to US export controls.
<P>The PGP version 2.6.2 executable object release package for MSDOS
contains the PGP executable software, documentation, RSAREF license,
sample key rings including my own public key, and signatures for the
software and this manual, all in one PKZIP compressed file called
pgp262.zip.  The PGP source release package for MSDOS contains all
the C source files in one PKZIP compressed file called pgp262s.zip. 
The filename for the release package is derived from the version
number of the release.

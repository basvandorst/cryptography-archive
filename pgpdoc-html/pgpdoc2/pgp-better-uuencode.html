<H2>Using PGP as a better uuencode</H2>
<P>A lot of people in the Unix world send binary data files through
E-mail channels by using the Unix <I>uuencode</I> utility to convert
the file into printable ASCII characters that can be sent via email.
No encryption is involved, so neither the sender nor the recipient
need any special keys.  The uuencode format was designed for a similar
purpose as PGP's radix-64 ASCII transport armor format described in
the <A HREF="../pgpdoc1/ciper-radix64-format.html">"Sending Ciphertext Through E-mail Channels: Radix-64
  Format"</A>
section, but not as good.  A different radix-64 character set is used.
Uuencode has its problems, such as 1) several slightly incompatible
character sets for different versions of uuencode in the MSDOS and
Unix worlds, and 2) the data can be corrupted by some E-mail gateways
that strip trailing blanks or do other modifications to the character
set used by uuencode.
<P>PGP may be used in a manner that offers the same general features as
uuencode, and then some.  You can get PGP to just convert a file into
PGP's radix-64 ASCII transport armor format, but you don't have to
encrypt the file or sign it, so no keys are needed by either party.
Simply use the <KBD>-a</KBD> option alone.  For example:
<PRE>
    pgp -a filename
</PRE>
This would produce a radix-64 armored file called <VAR>filename.asc</VAR>.
<P>If you read the <A HREF="../pgpdoc1/ciper-radix64-format.html">"Sending Ciphertext Through E-mail Channels:
  Radix-64 Format"</A> section, you
will see that PGP's approach offers several important advantages over
the uuencode approach:
<UL><LI>PGP will break big files up into chunks small enough to E-mail.
<LI>PGP will append a CRC error detection code to each chunk.
<LI>PGP will attempt to compress the data before converting it to
   radix-64 armor.
<LI>PGP's radix-64 character set is more resilient to E-mail character
   conversions than the one used by uuencode.
 <LI>Textfiles can be converted by the sender to canonical text
   format, as explained in the <A HREF="pgpdoc2_6.html#0">"Sending ASCII Text Files Across
     Different Machine Environments"</A>
   section.
</UL>
The recipient can restore the sender's original filename by unwrapping
the message with PGP's <KBD>-p</KBD> option.  You can use <KBD>pgp -a</KBD> in
any situation in which you could have used uuencode, if the recipient
also has PGP.  PGP is a better uuencode than uuencode.

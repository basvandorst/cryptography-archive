<H2>Making a message for her eyes only</H2>
<P>To specify that the recipient's decrypted plaintext will be shown ONLY
on her screen and will not be saved to disk, add the <KBD>-m</KBD> option:
<PRE>
     pgp -sem message.txt her_userid
</PRE>
Later, when the recipient decrypts the ciphertext with her secret key
and pass phrase, the plaintext will be displayed on her screen but
will not be saved to disk.  The text will be displayed as it would if
she used the Unix <CODE>more</CODE> command, one screenful at a time.  If
she wants to read the message again, she will have to decrypt the
ciphertext again.
<P>This feature is the safest way for you to prevent your sensitive
message from being inadvertently left on the recipient's disk.  This
feature was added at the request of a user who wanted to send
intimate messages to his lover, but was afraid she might accidentally
leave the decrypted messages on her husband's computer.
<P>Note that this feature will not prevent a clever and determined
person from finding a way to save the decrypted plaintext to disk --
it's to help prevent a casual user from doing it inadvertently.

<H2>Tempest attacks</H2>
<P>Another kind of attack that has been used by well-equipped opponents
involves the remote detection of the electromagnetic signals from
your computer.  This expensive and somewhat labor-intensive attack is
probably still cheaper than direct cryptanalytic attacks.  An
appropriately instrumented van can park near your office and remotely
pick up all of your keystrokes and messages displayed on your
computer video screen.  This would compromise all of your passwords,
messages, etc.  This attack can be thwarted by properly shielding all
of your computer equipment and network cabling so that it does not
emit these signals.  This shielding technology is known as "Tempest",
and is used by some Government agencies and defense contractors.  
There are hardware vendors who supply Tempest shielding commercially,
although it may be subject to some kind of Government licensing.  Now
why do you suppose the Government would restrict access to Tempest
shielding?

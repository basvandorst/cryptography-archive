<H2>Using PGP as a Unix-style filter</H2>
<P>Unix fans are accustomed to using Unix <I>pipes</I> to make two
applications work together.  The output of one application can be
directly fed through a pipe to be read as input to another
application.  For this to work, the applications must be capable of
reading the raw material from <I>standard input</I> and writing the
finished output to <I>standard output</I>.  PGP can operate in this
mode.  If you don't understand what this means, then you probably
don't need this feature.
<P>To use a Unix-style filter mode, reading from standard input and
writing to standard output, add the <KBD>-f</KBD> option, like so:
<PRE>
     pgp -feast her_userid &lt;inputfile &gt;outputfile
</PRE>
This feature makes it easier to make PGP work with electronic mail
applications.
<P>When using PGP in filter mode to decrypt a ciphertext file, you may
find it useful to use the PGPPASS environmental variable to hold the
pass phrase, so that you won't be prompted for it.  The PGPPASS
feature is explained below.

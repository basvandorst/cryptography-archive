<H2>Editing your user ID or pass phrase</H2>
<P>Sometimes you may need to change your pass phrase, perhaps because
someone looked over your shoulder while you typed it in.  
<P>Or you may need to change your user ID, because you got married and
changed your name, or maybe you changed your E-mail address.  Or
maybe you want to add a second or third user ID to your key, because
you may be known by more than one name or E-mail address or job
title.  PGP lets you attach more than one user ID to your key, any
one of which may be used to look up your key on the key ring.
<P>To edit your own userid or pass phrase for your secret key:
<PRE>
     pgp -ke userid [keyring]
</PRE>
PGP prompts you for a new user ID or a new pass phrase.
<P>If you edit your user ID, PGP actually adds a new user ID, without
deleting the old one.  If you want to delete an old user ID, you will
have to do that in a separate operation.
<P>The optional [keyring] parameter, if specified, must be a public
keyring, not a secret keyring.  The userid field must be your own
userid, which PGP knows is yours because it appears on both your
public keyring and your secret keyring.  Both keyrings will be
updated, even though you only specified the public keyring.
<P>The <KBD>-ke</KBD> command works differently depending on whether you use it on
a public or secret key.  It can also be used to edit the trust
parameters for a public key.

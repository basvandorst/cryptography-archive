<H3>SHOWPASS: echo pass phrase to user</H3>
<P>Default setting:  <CODE>SHOWPASS = off</CODE>
<P>Normally, PGP does not let you see your pass phrase as you type it
in.  This makes it harder for someone to look over your shoulder
while you type and learn your pass phrase.  But some typing-impaired
people have problems typing their pass phrase without seeing what
they are typing, and they may be typing in the privacy of their own
homes.  So they asked if PGP can be configured to let them see what
they type when they type in their pass phrase.
<P>The configuration parameter SHOWPASS enables PGP to echo your typing 
during pass phrase entry.

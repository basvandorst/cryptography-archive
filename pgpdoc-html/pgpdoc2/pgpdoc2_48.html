<H3>PGP's conventional encryption algorithm</H3>
<P>As described earlier, PGP "bootstraps" into a conventional single-key
encryption algorithm by using a public key algorithm to encipher the
conventional session key and then switching to fast conventional
cryptography.  So let's talk about this conventional encryption
algorithm.  It isn't the DES.
<P>The Federal Data Encryption Standard (DES) used to be a good
algorithm for most commercial applications.  But the Government never
did trust the DES to protect its own classified data, because the DES
key length is only 56 bits, short enough for a brute force attack. 
Also, the full 16-round DES has been attacked with some success by
Biham and Shamir using differential cryptanalysis, and by Matsui
using linear cryptanalysis.
<P>The most devastating practical attack on the DES was described at the
Crypto '93 conference, where Michael Wiener of Bell Northern Research
presented a paper on how to crack the DES with a special machine.  He
has fully designed and tested a chip that guesses 50 million DES keys
per second until it finds the right one.  Although he has refrained
from building the real chips so far, he can get these chips
manufactured for $10.50 each, and can build 57000 of them into a
special machine for $1 million that can try every DES key in 7 hours,
averaging a solution in 3.5 hours.  $1 million can be hidden in the
budget of many companies.  For $10 million, it takes 21 minutes to
crack, and for $100 million, just two minutes.  With any major
government's budget for examining DES traffic, it can be cracked in
seconds.  This means that straight 56-bit DES is now effectively dead
for purposes of serious data security applications.  
<P>A possible successor to DES may be a variation known as <I>triple
  DES</I>, which uses two DES keys to encrypt three times, achieving an
effective key space of 112 bits.  But this approach is three times
slower than normal DES.  A future version of PGP may support triple
DES as an option.
<P>PGP does not use the DES as its conventional single-key algorithm to
encrypt messages.  Instead, PGP uses a different conventional
single-key block encryption algorithm, called IDEA(tm).
<P>For the cryptographically curious, the IDEA cipher has a 64-bit block
size for the plaintext and the ciphertext.  It uses a key size of 128
bits.  It is based on the design concept of "mixing operations from
different algebraic groups".  It runs much faster in software than the
DES.  Like the DES, it can be used in cipher feedback
(CFB) and cipher block chaining (CBC) modes.  PGP uses it in 64-bit
CFB mode.
<P>The IPES/IDEA block cipher was developed at ETH in Zurich by James L.
Massey and Xuejia Lai, and published in 1990.  This is not a 
"home-grown" algorithm.  Its designers have a distinguished
reputation in the cryptologic community.  Early published papers on
the algorithm called it IPES (Improved Proposed Encryption Standard),
but they later changed the name to IDEA (International Data
Encryption Algorithm).  So far, IDEA has resisted attack much better
than other ciphers such as FEAL, REDOC-II, LOKI, Snefru and Khafre. 
And recent evidence suggests that IDEA is more resistant than the DES
to Biham &amp; Shamir's highly successful differential cryptanalysis
attack.  Biham and Shamir have been examining the IDEA cipher for
weaknesses, without success.  Academic cryptanalyst groups in
Belgium, England, and Germany are also attempting to attack it, as
well as the military services from several European countries.  As
this new cipher continues to attract attack efforts from the most
formidable quarters of the cryptanalytic world, confidence in IDEA is
growing with the passage of time.
<P>Every once in a while, I get a letter from someone who has just
learned the awful truth that PGP does not use pure RSA to encrypt
bulk data.  They are concerned that the whole package is weakened if
we use a hybrid public-key and conventional scheme just to speed
things up.  After all, a chain is only as strong as its weakest
link.  They demand an explanation for this apparent "compromise" in
the strength of PGP.  This may be because they have been caught up in
the public's reverence and awe for the strength and mystique of RSA,
mistakenly believing that RSA is intrinsically stronger than any
conventional cipher.  Well, it's not.  
<P>People who work in factoring research say that the workload to
exhaust all the possible 128-bit keys in the IDEA cipher would
roughly equal the factoring workload to crack a 3100-bit RSA key,
which is quite a bit bigger than the 1024-bit RSA key size that most
people use for high security applications.  Given this range of key
sizes, and assuming there are no hidden weaknesses in the
conventional cipher, the weak link in this hybrid approach is in the
public key algorithm, not the conventional cipher.
<P>It is not ergonomically practical to use pure RSA with large keys to
encrypt and decrypt long messages.  A 1024-bit RSA key would decrypt
messages about 4000 times slower than the IDEA cipher.  Absolutely no
one does it that way in the real world.  Many people less experienced
in cryptography do not realize that the attraction of public key
cryptography is not because it is intrinsically stronger than a
conventional cipher-- its appeal is because it helps you manage keys
more conveniently.
<P>Not only is RSA too slow to use on bulk data, but it even has certain
weaknesses that can be exploited in some special cases of particular
kinds of messages that are fed to the RSA cipher, even for large
keys.  These special cases can be avoided by using the hybrid
approach of using RSA to encrypt random session keys for a
conventional cipher, like PGP does.  So the bottom line is this: 
Using pure RSA on bulk data is the wrong approach, period.  It's too
slow, it's not stronger, and may even be weaker.  If you find a
software application that uses pure RSA on bulk data, it probably
means the implementor does not understand these issues, which could
imply he doesn't understand other important concepts of cryptography.

<H3>LANGUAGE: foreign language selector</H3>
<P>Default setting:  <CODE>LANGUAGE = "en"</CODE>
<P>PGP displays various prompts, warning messages, and advisories to the
user on the screen.  For example, messages such as <EM>"File not
  found."</EM>, or <EM>"Please enter your pass phrase:"</EM>.  These
messages are normally in English.  But it is possible to get PGP to
display its messages to the user in other languages, without having to
modify the PGP executable program.
<P>A number of people in various countries have translated all of PGP's
display messages, warnings, and prompts into their native languages.
These hundreds of translated message strings have been placed in a
special text file called <VAR>language.txt</VAR>, distributed with the PGP
release.  The messages are stored in this file in English, Spanish,
Dutch, German, French, Italian, Russian, Latvian, and Lithuanian.
Other languages may be added later.
<P>The configuration parameter LANGUAGE specifies what language to
display these messages in.  LANGUAGE may be set to <CODE>en</CODE> for
English, <CODE>es</CODE> for Spanish, <CODE>de</CODE> for German, <CODE>nl</CODE> for
Dutch, <CODE>fr</CODE> for French, <CODE>it</CODE> for Italian, <CODE>ru</CODE> for
Russian, <CODE>lt3</CODE> for Lithuanian, <CODE>lv</CODE> for Latvian, <CODE>esp</CODE>
for Esperanto.  For example, if this line appeared in the
configuration file:
<PRE>
     LANGUAGE = "fr"
</PRE>
PGP would select French as the language for its display messages.
The default setting is English.
<P>When PGP needs to display a message to the user, it looks in the
<VAR>language.txt</VAR> file for the equivalent message string in the
selected foreign language and displays that translated message to the
user.  If PGP can't find the language string file, or if the selected
language is not in the file, or if that one phrase is not translated
into the selected language in the file, or if that phrase is missing
entirely from the file, PGP displays the message in English.
<P>To conserve disk space, most foreign translations are not included 
in the standard PGP release package, but are available separately.

<H2>Decrypting the message and leaving the signature on it</H2>
<P>Usually, you want PGP to completely unravel a ciphertext file,
decrypting it and checking the nested signature if there is one,
peeling away the layers until you are left with only the original
plaintext file.
<P>But sometimes you want to decrypt an encrypted file, and leave the
inner signature still attached, so that you are left with a decrypted
signed message.  This may be useful if you want to send a copy of a
signed document to a third party, perhaps re-enciphering it.  For
example, suppose you get a message signed by Charlie, encrypted to
you.  You want to decrypt it, and, leaving Charlie's signature on it,
you want to send it to Alice, perhaps re-enciphering it with Alice's
public key.  No problem.  PGP can handle that.
<P>To simply decrypt a message and leave the signature on it intact,
type:
<PRE>
    pgp -d letter
</PRE>
This decrypts letter.pgp, and if there is an inner signature, it is
left intact with the decrypted plaintext in the output file.
<P>Now you can archive it, or maybe re-encrypt it and send it to someone
else.

<H2>Exposure on multi-user systems</H2>
<P>PGP was originally designed for a single-user MSDOS machine under
your direct physical control.  I run PGP at home on my own PC, and
unless someone breaks into my house or monitors my electromagnetic
emissions, they probably can't see my plaintext files or secret keys. 
<P>But now PGP also runs on multi-user systems such as Unix and
VAX/VMS.  On multi-user systems, there are much greater
risks of your plaintext or keys or passwords being exposed.  The Unix
system administrator or a clever intruder can read your plaintext
files, or perhaps even use special software to covertly monitor your
keystrokes or read what's on your screen.  On a Unix system, any other
user can read your environment information remotely by simply using
the Unix <I>ps</I> command.  Similar problems exist for MSDOS machines
connected on a local area network.  The actual security risk is
dependent on your particular situation.  Some multi-user systems may
be safe because all the users are trusted, or because they have system
security measures that are safe enough to withstand the attacks
available to the intruders, or because there just aren't any
sufficiently interested intruders.  Some Unix systems are safe because
they are only used by one user -- there are even some notebook
computers running Unix.  It would be unreasonable to simply exclude
PGP from running on all Unix systems.
<P>PGP is not designed to protect your data while it is in plaintext
form on a compromised system.  Nor can it prevent an intruder from
using sophisticated measures to read your secret key while it is
being used.  You will just have to recognize these risks on
multi-user systems, and adjust your expectations and behavior
accordingly.  Perhaps your situation is such that you should consider
running PGP only on an isolated single-user system under your direct
physical control.  That's what I do, and that's what I recommend.

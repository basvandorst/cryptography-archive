<H3>CERT_DEPTH: how deep may introducers be nested</H3>
<P>Default setting:  <CODE>CERT_DEPTH = 4</CODE>
<P>The configuration parameter CERT_DEPTH specifies how many levels deep
you may nest introducers to certify other introducers to certify
public keys on your public key ring.  For example, If CERT_DEPTH is
set to 1, there may only be one layer of introducers below your own
ultimately-trusted key.  If that were the case, you would be required
to directly certify the public keys of all trusted introducers on
your key ring.  If you set CERT_DEPTH to 0, you could have no
introducers at all, and you would have to directly certify each and
every key on your public key ring in order to use it.  The minimum
CERT_DEPTH is 0, the maximum is 8.

  of Which Keys are Valid?"</A>

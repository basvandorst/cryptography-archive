   ViaCrypt
   9033 North 24th Avenue, Suite 7
   Phoenix, Arizona 85021  USA
   Phone: (602) 944-0773, or (800) 536-2664

ViaCrypt has a version of PGP for MSDOS, and a number of Unix
platforms.  They also have a Windows shell version, and other 
versions are under development, including Macintosh.  If you have a
need to use PGP in a commercial or Government setting, and ViaCrypt
has a version of PGP for your hardware platform, you should get
ViaCrypt PGP.
<P>ViaCrypt has obtained all the necessary licenses from PKP, Ascom-Tech
AG, and Philip Zimmermann to sell PGP for use in commercial or
government environments.  ViaCrypt PGP is every bit as secure as the
freeware PGP, and is entirely compatible in both directions with the
freeware version of PGP.  ViaCrypt PGP is the perfect way to get a
fully licensed version of PGP into your corporate environment.
<P>If you work in a large company and you are a fan of PGP, I urge you
to try to persuade your company to buy lots of copies of PGP from
ViaCrypt.  Not just because that will earn royalties for me.  If
ViaCrypt can make PGP a commercial success, it will go a long way
toward cementing PGP's political future as an unstoppable standard
for E-mail encryption in the corporate world.  The corporate world is
where the money is, and that affects public policy like nothing
else.  And that includes Government policy to suppress strong
cryptography.

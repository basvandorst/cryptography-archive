<H2>Computer-related political groups</H2>
<P>PGP is a very political piece of software.  It seems appropriate to
mention here some computer-related activist groups.  Full details on
these groups, and how to join them, is provided in a separate
document file in the PGP release package.
<P>The Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) is a public interest
research center in Washington, DC.  It was established in 1994 to
focus public attention on emerging privacy issues relating to the
National Information Infrastructure, such as the Clipper Chip, the
Digital Telephony proposal, medical record privacy, and the sale of
consumer data.  EPIC is sponsored by the Fund for Constitutional
Government and Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility. 
EPIC publishes the EPIC Alert and EPIC Reports, pursues Freedom of
Information Act litigation, and conducts policy research on emerging
privacy issues.  For more information email info@epic.org, or write
EPIC, 666 Pennsylvania Ave., SE, Suite 301, Washington, DC 20003.
+1 202 544 9240 (tel), +1 202 547 5482 (fax).
<P>The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) was founded in 1990 to
assure freedom of expression in digital media, with a particular
emphasis on applying the principles embodied in the US Constitution
and the Bill of Rights to computer-based communication.  They can be
reached in Washington DC, at (202) 347-5400.  Internet E-mail address:
eff@eff.org.
<P>Computer Professionals For Social Responsibility (CPSR) empowers
computer professionals and computer users to advocate for the
responsible use of information technology and empowers all who use
computer technology to participate in public policy debates on the
impacts of computers on society.  They can be reached at:
(415) 322-3778 in Palo Alto, E-mail address cpsr@csli.stanford.edu.
<P>The League for Programming Freedom (LPF) is a grass-roots
organization of professors, students, businessmen, programmers and
users dedicated to bringing back the freedom to write programs.  They
regard patents on computer algorithms as harmful to the US software
industry (and so do I!).  They can be reached at (617) 433-7071. 
E-mail address: lpf@uunet.uu.net.
<P>For more details on these groups, see the accompanying document in
the PGP release package.

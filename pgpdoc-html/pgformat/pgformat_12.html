<H2>Conventional key encrypted data packet</H2>
<PRE>
Offset  Length  Meaning
0       1       CTB for Conventional-Key-Encrypted data packet
1       4       32-bit (or maybe 16-bit) length of packet
5       ?       conventionally-encrypted data.
                plaintext has 64 bits of random data prepended,
                plus 16 bits prepended for "key check" purposes
</PRE>
The decrypted ciphertext may contain a compressed data packet or a
literal plaintext packet.
<P>After decrypting the conventionally-encrypted data, a special 8-byte
random prefix and 2 <I>key check</I> bytes are revealed.  The random prefix
and key check prefix are inserted before encryption and discarded after
decryption.  This prefix group is visible after decrypting the
ciphertext in the packet.
<P>The random prefix serves to start off the cipher feedback chaining
process with 64 bits of random material.  It may be discarded after
decryption.  The first 8 bytes is the random prefix material, followed
by the 2-byte <I>key-check</I> prefix.
<P>The key-check prefix is composed of two identical copies of the last
2 random bytes in the random prefix, in the same order.  During
decryption, the 9th and 10th bytes of decrypted plaintext are checked
to see if they match the 7th and 8th bytes, respectively.  If these
key-check bytes meet this criterion, then the conventional key is
assumed to be correct.  
<P>One unusual point about the way encryption is done.  Using the IDEA
cipher in CFB mode, the first 10 bytes are decrypted normally,
but bytes 10 to 17, the first 8 bytes of the data proper, are
encrypted using bytes 2 to 9 (the last 8 bytes of the key check
prefix) as the IV.  This is essentially using CFB-16 for one
part of the encryption, while CFB-64 is used elsewhere.

<H2>Conventional data encryption key (DEK) "packet"</H2>
<P>The DEK has no CTB packet framing.  The DEK is stored packetless and
naked, with padding, encrypted inside the MPI in the RSA
public-key-encrypted packet.
<P>PGP versions 2.3 and later use a new format for encoding the message
digest into the MPI in the signature packet.  (This format is not
presently based on any RFCs due to the use of the IDEA encryption
system.)  This format is accepted but not written by version 2.2.  The
older format used by versions 2.2 and earlier is also accepted by
versions up to 2.4, but the RSAREF code in 2.5 is unable to cope
with it.
<P>PGP versions 2.2 and earlier encode the MD into the MPI as follows:
<PRE>
        MSB                     .   .   .                          LSB
 
         0   1   DEK(16 bytes)   CSUM(2 bytes)   0   RND(n bytes)   2
</PRE>
CSUM refers to a 16-bit checksum appended to the high end of the
DEK.  RND is a string of NONZERO pseudorandom bytes,
enough to make the length of this whole string equal to the number of
bytes in the modulus.
<P>PGP versions 2.3 and later encode the MD into the MPI as follows:
<PRE>
        MSB                     .   .   .                   LSB
 
         0   2   RND(n bytes)   0   1   DEK(16 bytes)   CSUM(2 bytes)
</PRE>
CSUM refers to a 16-bit checksum appended to the high end of the
DEK.  RND is a string of NONZERO pseudorandom bytes,
enough to make the length of this whole string equal to the number of
bytes in the modulus.
<P>For both versions, the 16-bit checksum is computed on the rest of the
bytes in the DEK key material, and does not include any other material
in the calculation.  In the above MSB-first representation, the
checksum is also stored MSB-first.  The checksum is there to help us
determine if we used the right RSA secret key for decryption.
<P>All this mainly affects the <CODE>rsa_public_encrypt()</CODE> and
<CODE>rsa_private_decrypt()</CODE> functions in <VAR>rsaglue.c</VAR>.

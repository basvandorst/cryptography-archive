<H2>Keyring trust packet</H2>
<P>The three different forms of this packet each come after: a public key
packet, a user ID packet, or a signature packet on the public key
ring.  They exist only on a public key ring, and are never extracted
with a key.  Don't copy this separate trust byte packet from keyring,
and do add it in back in when adding to keyring.
<P>The meaning of the keyring trust packet is context sensitive.  The
trust byte has three different definitions depending on whether it
follows a key packet on the ring, or follows a user ID packet on the
ring, or follows a signature on the ring.
<PRE>
Offset  Length  Meaning
0       1       CTB for Keyring trust packet
1       1       8-bit length of packet (always 1 for now)
2       1       Trust flag byte, with context-sensitive bit 
                definitions given below.
</PRE>
For trust bytes that apply to the preceding key packet, the following
bit definitions apply:
<PRE>
  Bits 0-2 - OWNERTRUST bits - Trust bits for this key owner.  Values are:
       000 - undefined, or uninitialized trust.
       001 - unknown, we don't know the owner of this key.
       010 - We usually do not trust this key owner to sign other keys.
       011 - reserved
       100 - reserved
       101 - We usually do trust this key owner to sign other keys.
       110 - We always trust this key owner to sign other keys.
       111 - This key is also present in the secret keyring.
  Bits 3-4 - Reserved.
  Bit 5 - DISABLED bit - Means that this key is disabled, and
          should not be used.
  Bit 6 - Reserved
  Bit 7 - BUCKSTOP bit - Means this key also appears in secret key ring.
          Signifies the ultimately-trusted "keyring owner".
          "The buck stops here".  This bit computed from looking 
          at secret key ring.  If this bit is set, then all the
          KEYLEGIT fields are set to maximum for all the user IDs for 
          this key, and OWNERTRUST is also set to ultimate trust.
</PRE>
For trust bytes that apply to the preceding user ID packet, the
following bit definitions apply:
<PRE>
  Bit 0-1 - KEYLEGIT bits - Validity bits for this key.
          Set if we believe the preceding key is legitimately owned by 
          who it appears to belong to, specified by the preceding user 
          ID.  Computed from various signature trust packets that 
          follow.  Also, always fully set if BUCKSTOP is set.  
          To define the KEYLEGIT byte does not require that 
          OWNERTRUST be nonzero, but OWNERTRUST nonzero does require 
          that KEYLEGIT be fully set to maximum trust.
       00 - unknown, undefined, or uninitialized trust.
       01 - We do not trust this key's ownership.
       10 - We have marginal confidence of this key's ownership.
            Totally useless for certifying other keys, but may be useful 
            for checking message signatures with an advisory warning 
            to the user.
       11 - We completely trust this key's ownership.
            This requires either:
                - 1 ultimately trusted signature (a signature from
                  yourself, SIGTRUST=111)
                - COMPLETES_NEEDED completely trusted signatures
                  (SIGTRUST=110)
                - MARGINALS_NEEDED marginally trusted signatures
                  (SIGTRUST=101)
                COMPLETES_NEEDED and MARGINALS_NEEDED are configurable
                constants.
  Bit 7 - WARNONLY bit - If the user wants to use a not fully validated
          key for encryption, he is asked if he really wants to use this
          key.  If the user answers 'yes', the WARNONLY bit gets set,
          and the next time he uses this key, only a warning will be
          printed. This bit gets cleared during the maintenance pass.
</PRE>
For a trust byte that applies to the preceding signature, the
following bit definitions apply:
<PRE>
  Bits 0-2 - SIGTRUST bits - Trust bits for this signature.  Value is
             copied directly from OWNERTRUST bits of signer:
       000 - undefined, or uninitialized trust.
       001 - unknown
       010 - We do not trust this signature.
       011 - reserved
       100 - reserved
       101 - We reasonably trust this signature.
       110 - We completely trust this signature.
       111 - ultimately trusted signature (from the owner of the ring)
  Bits 3-6 - Reserved.
  Bit 6 - CHECKED bit - This means that the key checking pass (pgp -kc,
          also invoked automatically whenever keys are added to the
          keyring) has tested this signature and found it good.  If
          this bit is not set, the maintenance pass considers this
          signature untrustworthy.
  Bit 7 - CONTIG bit - Means this signature leads up a contiguous trusted 
          certification path all the way back to the ultimately-
          trusted keyring owner, where the buck stops.  This bit is derived 
          from other trust packets.  It is currently not used for anything
          in PGP.
</PRE>
The OWNERTRUST bits are set by the user.  PGP does not modify them.
PGP computes the BUCKSTOP bit by checking to see if the key is on the
secret key ring.  If it is, it was created by this user, and thus
controlled by him.
<P>All other trust is derived from the BUCKSTOP keys in a special
maintenance pass over the keyring.  Any good signature made by a given
key has its SIGTRUST equal to the key's OWNERTRUST.  Based on
COMPLETES_NEEDED and MARGINALS_NEEDED, if enough trusted signatures are
on a key/userID pair, the key/userid association is considered
legitimate.
<P>To be precise, an ultimately trusted key has weight 1, a completely
trusted key has weight 1/COMPLETES_NEEDED (or 0 if COMPLETES_NEEDED
is 0), and a marginally trsuted key has weight 1/MARGINALS_NEEDED.
Other trust values have weight 0.  If the total weight of the signatures
on a key/userid pair is 1 or more, the userid is considered legitimate.
<P>When a key has a legitimate userid, the user is asked to set the
OWNERTRUST for the corresponding key.  Ths idea is that the userid
identifies someone the user knows, at least by reputation, so once it
has been established who holds the secret key, that person's
trustworthiness as an introducer can be established and assigned to the
key.
<P>Once that is done, the key's signatures then have weight establishing
other key/userid associations.
<P>There is a limit to the depth to which this can go.  Keys on the secret
keyring are at depth 0.  Keys signed by those keys are at depth 1.
Keys which are fully certified using only signatures from keys at depth
1 or less are at depth 2.  Keys which are fully certified using only
signatures from keys at depth 2 or less are at depth 3, and so on.
<P>If you know all of your trusted introducers personally, and have signed
their keys, then you will never have a key at a depth of greater than 2.
The maximum depth is limited my MAX_CERT_DPETH.  It never gets very large
in a well-connected "web of trust".
<P>This redundant and decentralized method of determining public key
legitimacy is one of the principal strengths of PGP's key management
architecture, as compared with PEM, when used in social structures
that are not miltiary-style rigid hierarchies.
<P>The trust of a key owner (OWNERTRUST) does not just reflect our
estimation of their personal integrity, it also reflects how competent
we think they are at understanding key management and using good
judgement in signing keys.  The OWNERTRUST bits are not computed from
anything -- it requires asking the user for his opinion.  
<P>To define the OWNERTRUST bits for a key owner, ask:
<PRE>
    Would you always trust "Oliver North" 
    to certify other public keys?
    (1=Yes, 2=No, 3=Usually, 4=I don't know) ? _
</PRE>
When a key is added to the key ring the trust bytes are initialized
to zero (undefined).
<P>[--manual setting of SIGTRUST/OWNERTRUST not implemented]
Normally, we derive the value of the SIGTRUST field by copying it
directly from the signer key's OWNERTRUST field.  Under special
circumstances, if the user explicitly requests it with a special PGP
command, we may let the user override the copied value for SIGTRUST
by displaying an advisory to him and asking him for ratification,
like so:
<PRE>
    This key is signed by "Oliver North",
    whom you usually trust to sign keys.
    Do you trust "Oliver North" 
    to certify the key for "Daniel Ellsberg"?
    (1=Yes, 2=No, 3=Somewhat, 4=I don't know) ? _      &lt;default is yes&gt;
</PRE>
Or:
<PRE>
    This key is signed by "Oliver North",
    whom you usually do not trust to sign keys.
    Do you trust "Oliver North" 
    to certify the key for "Daniel Ellsberg"?
    (1=Yes, 2=No, 3=Somewhat, 4=I don't know) ? _      &lt;default is no&gt;
</PRE>
An <SAMP>I don't know</SAMP> response to this question would have the same
effect as a response of <SAMP>no</SAMP>.
<P>If we had no information about the trustworthiness of the signer (the
OWNERTRUST field was uninitialized), we would leave the advisory note
off.
<P>Certifying a public key is a serious matter, essentially promising to
the world that you vouch for this key's ownership.  But sometimes I
just want to make a <I>working assumption</I> of trust for someone's
public key, for my own purposes on my own keyring, without taking the
serious step of actually certifying it for the rest of the world.  In
that case, we can use a special PGP keyring management command to
manually set the KEYLEGIT field, without relying on it being computed
during a maintenance pass.  Later, if a maintenance pass discovers a
KEYLEGIT bit set that would not have been otherwise computed as set by
the maintenance pass logic, it alerts me and asks me to confirm that I
really want it set.  
<P>[--end of not implemented section]
<P>During routine use of the public keyring, we don't actually check the
associated signatures certifying a public key.  Rather, we always 
rely on trust bytes to tell us whether to trust the key in question. 
We depend on a separate checking pass (pgp -kc) to actually check the key
signature certificates against the associated keys, and to set the
trust bytes accordingly.  This pass checks signatures, and if a
signature fails to verify, obnoxiously alerts the user and drops it from
the key ring.  Then it tuns a maintenance pass to calculate the
ring-wide effects of this.
<P>A failed signature should be exceedingly rare, and it may not even
result in a KEYLEGIT field being downgraded.  Having several signatures
certifying each key should prevent damage from spreading too far from a
failed certificate.  But if dominoes do keep falling from this, it may
indicate the discovery of an important elaborate attack.
<P>The maintenance pass is run every time the keyring changes, and
operates in a top-of-pyramid-down manner as follows.
<P>If at any time during any of these steps the KEYLEGIT field goes from
not fully set to fully set, and the OWNERTRUST bits are still undefined,
the user is asked a question to define the OWNERTRUST bits.  First, for
all keys with BUCKSTOP set, check if they are really present in the
secret keyring, if not, the BUCKSTOP bit is cleared.  SIGTRUST and
KEYLEGIT is initialized to zero for non-buckstop keys.
<P>The real maintenance pass is done in a recursive scan:  Start with
BUCKSTOP keys, find all userid/key pairs signed by a key and update
the trust value of these signatures by copying the OWNERTRUST of the
signer to the SIGTRUST of the signature.  If this makes a key fully
validated, start looking for signatures made by this key, and update
the trust value for them.  Repeat until everything has settled down.

<H2>User ID packet</H2>
<PRE>
Offset  Length  Meaning
0       1       CTB for User ID packet
1       1       8-bit length of packet
2       ?       User ID string, size is as in preceding length byte
</PRE>
The User ID packet follows a public key on a public key ring.  It
also follows a secret key on a secret key ring.
<P>When a key is certified by a signature, the signature covers both the
public key packet and the User ID packet.  The signature certificate
thereby logically <I>binds</I> together the user ID with the key.  The
user ID packet is always associated with the most recently occurring
public key on the key ring, regardless of whether there are other
packet types appearing between the public key packet and the
associated user ID packet.
<P>There may be more than one User ID packet after a public key packet.
They all would be associated with the preceding public key packet.

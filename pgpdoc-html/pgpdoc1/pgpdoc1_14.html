<H3>RSA key generation</H3>
<P>To generate your own unique public/secret key pair of a specified
size, type:  
<PRE>
    pgp -kg
</PRE>
PGP shows you a menu of recommended key sizes (low commercial grade,
high commercial grade, or "military" grade) and prompts you for what
size key you want, up to more than a thousand bits.  The bigger the
key, the more security you get, but you pay a price in speed.
<P>It also asks for a user ID, which means your name.  It's a good idea
to use your full name as your user ID, because then there is less risk
of other people using the wrong public key to encrypt messages to you.
Spaces and punctuation are allowed in the user ID.  It
would help if you put your E-mail address in &lt;angle brackets&gt; after
your name, like so:
<PRE>
    Robert M. Smith &lt;rms@xyzcorp.com&gt;  
</PRE>
If you don't have an E-mail address, use your phone number or some
other unique information that would help ensure that your user ID is
unique.
<P>PGP also asks for a <I>pass phrase</I> to protect your secret key in
case it falls into the wrong hands.  Nobody can use your secret key
file without this pass phrase.  The pass phrase is like a password,
except that it can be a whole phrase or sentence with many words,
spaces, punctuation, or anything else you want in it.  Don't lose this
pass phrase -- there's no way to recover it if you do lose it.  This
pass phrase will be needed later every time you use your secret key.
The pass phrase is case-sensitive, and should not be too short or easy
to guess.  It is never displayed on the screen.  Don't leave it
written down anywhere where someone else can see it, and don't store
it on your computer.  If you don't want a pass phrase (You fool!),
just press return (or enter) at the pass phrase prompt.
<P>The public/secret key pair is derived from large truly random numbers
derived mainly from measuring the intervals between your keystrokes
with a fast timer.  The software will ask you to enter some random
text to help it accumulate some random bits for the keys.  When
asked, you should provide some keystrokes that are reasonably random
in their timing, and it wouldn't hurt to make the actual characters
that you type irregular in content as well.  Some of the randomness
is derived from the unpredictability of the content of what you
type.  So don't just type repeated sequences of characters.
<P>Note that RSA key generation is a lengthy process.  It may take a few
seconds for a small key on a fast processor, or quite a few minutes
for a large key on an old IBM PC/XT.  PGP will visually
indicate its progress during key generation.
<P>The generated key pair will be placed on your public and secret key
rings.  You can later use the <KBD>-kx</KBD> command option to extract
(copy) your new public key from your public key ring and place it in a
separate public key file suitable for distribution to your friends.
The public key file can be sent to your friends for inclusion in their
public key rings.  Naturally, you keep your secret key file to
yourself, and you should include it on your secret key ring.  Each
secret key on a key ring is individually protected with its own pass
phrase.
<P>Never give your secret key to anyone else.  For the same reason, don't
make key pairs for your friends.  Everyone should make their own key
pair.  Always keep physical control of your secret key, and don't risk
exposing it by storing it on a remote timesharing computer.  Keep it
on your own personal computer.
<P>If PGP complains about not being able to find the PGP User's Guide on
your computer, and refuses to generate a key pair without it, don't
panic.  Just read the explanation of the NOMANUAL parameter in the
section <A HREF="../pgpdoc2/setting-conf-par.html">"Setting Configuration
  Parameters"</A> in the Special Topics
volume of the PGP User's Guide.

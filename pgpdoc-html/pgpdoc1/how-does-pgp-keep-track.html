<H3>How does PGP keep track of which keys are valid?</H3>
<P>Before you read this section, be sure to read the above section on
<A HREF="how-to-protext-pk-from-tamp.html#0">"How to Protect Public Keys from
  Tampering"</A>.
<P>PGP keeps track of which keys on your public key ring are properly
certified with signatures from introducers that you trust.  All you
have to do is tell PGP which people you trust as introducers, and
certify their keys yourself with your own ultimately trusted key.
PGP can take it from there, automatically validating any other keys
that have been signed by your designated introducers.  And of course
you may directly sign more keys yourself.
<P>There are two entirely separate criteria PGP uses to judge a public
key's usefulness -- don't get them confused: 
<OL><LI>Does the key actually belong to whom it appears to belong?  In
  other words, has it been certified with a trusted signature?
<LI>Does it belong to someone you can trust to certify other keys?
</OL>
PGP can calculate the answer to the first question.  To answer the
second question, PGP must be explicitly told by you, the user.  When
you supply the answer to question 2, PGP can then calculate the
answer to question 1 for other keys signed by the introducer you
designated as trusted.
<P>Keys that have been certified by a trusted introducer are deemed
valid by PGP.  The keys belonging to trusted introducers must
themselves be certified either by you or by other trusted
introducers.
<P>PGP also allows for the possibility of you having several shades of
trust for people to act as introducers.  Your trust for a key's owner
to act as an introducer does not just reflect your estimation of
their personal integrity -- it should also reflect how competent you
think they are at understanding key management and using good
judgment in signing keys.  You can designate a person to PGP as
unknown, untrusted, marginally trusted, or completely trusted to
certify other public keys.  This trust information is stored on your
key ring with their key, but when you tell PGP to copy a key off your
key ring, PGP will not copy the trust information along with the key,
because your private opinions on trust are regarded as confidential. 
<P>When PGP is calculating the validity of a public key, it examines the
trust level of all the attached certifying signatures.  It computes a
weighted score of validity -- two marginally trusted signatures are
deemed as credible as one fully trusted signature.  PGP's skepticism
is adjustable -- for example, you may tune PGP to require two fully
trusted signatures or three marginally trusted signatures to judge a
key as valid.
<P>Your own key is <EM>"axiomatically"</EM> valid to PGP, needing no
introducer's signature to prove its validity.  PGP knows which public
keys are yours, by looking for the corresponding secret keys on the
secret key ring.  PGP also assumes you ultimately trust yourself to
certify other keys.
<P>As time goes on, you will accumulate keys from other people that you
may want to designate as trusted introducers.  Everyone else will
each choose their own trusted introducers.  And everyone will
gradually accumulate and distribute with their key a collection of
certifying signatures from other people, with the expectation that
anyone receiving it will trust at least one or two of the signatures. 
This will cause the emergence of a decentralized fault-tolerant web
of confidence for all public keys.
<P>This unique grass-roots approach contrasts sharply with Government
standard public key management schemes, such as Internet Privacy
Enhanced Mail (PEM), which are based on centralized control and
mandatory centralized trust.  The standard schemes rely on a
hierarchy of Certifying Authorities who dictate who you must trust. 
PGP's decentralized probabilistic method for determining public key
legitimacy is the centerpiece of its key management architecture. 
PGP lets you alone choose who you trust, putting you at the top of
your own private certification pyramid.  PGP is for people who prefer
to pack their own parachutes.

<H3>What if you lose your secret key?</H3>
<P>Normally, if you want to revoke your own secret key, you can use the
<KBD>-kd</KBD> command to issue a revocation certificate, signed with your
own secret key (see <A HREF="pgpdoc1_22.html#0">"Revoking a Public Key"</A>).
<P>But what can you do if you lose your secret key, or if your secret
key is destroyed?  You can't revoke it yourself, because you must use
your own secret key to revoke it, and you don't have it anymore.  A
future version of PGP will offer a more secure means of revoking keys
in these circumstances, allowing trusted introducers to certify that
a public key has been revoked.  But for now, you will have to get the
word out through whatever informal means you can, asking users to
<I>disable</I> your public key on their own individual public key rings.
<P>Other users may disable your public key on their own public key rings
by using the <KBD>-kd</KBD> command.  If a user ID is specified that does not
correspond to a secret key on the secret key ring, the <KBD>-kd</KBD> command
will look for that user ID on the public key ring, and mark that
public key as disabled.  A disabled key may not be used to encrypt
any messages, and may not be extracted from the key ring with the <KBD>-kx</KBD>
command.  It can still be used to check signatures, but a warning is
displayed.  And if the user tries to add the same key again to his
key ring, it will not work because the disabled key is already on the
key ring.  These combined features will help curtail the further
spread of a disabled key.
<P>If the specified public key is already disabled, the <KBD>-kd</KBD> command
will ask if you want the key reenabled.

<P>Pretty Good(tm) Privacy (PGP), from Phil's Pretty Good Software, is a
high security cryptographic software application for MSDOS, UNIX,
VAX/VMS, and other computers.  PGP allows people to exchange files or
messages with privacy, authentication, and convenience.  Privacy means
that only those intended to receive a message can read it.
Authentication means that messages that appear to be from a particular
person can only have originated from that person.  Convenience means
that privacy and authentication are provided without the hassles of
managing keys associated with conventional cryptographic software.  No
secure channels are needed to exchange keys between users, which makes
PGP much easier to use.  This is because PGP is based on a powerful
new technology called <I>public key</I> cryptography.
<P>PGP combines the convenience of the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA)
public key cryptosystem with the speed of conventional cryptography,
message digests for digital signatures, data compression before
encryption, good ergonomic design, and sophisticated key management. 
And PGP performs the public-key functions faster than most other
software implementations.  PGP is public key cryptography for the
masses.
<P>PGP does not provide any built-in modem communications capability. 
You must use a separate software product for that.
<P>This document, <CITE>Volume I: Essential Topics</CITE>, only explains the
essential concepts for using PGP, and should be read by all PGP users.
<CITE>Volume II: Special Topics</CITE> covers the advanced features of PGP
and other special topics, and may be read by more serious PGP users.
Neither volume explains the underlying technology details of
cryptographic algorithms and data structures.

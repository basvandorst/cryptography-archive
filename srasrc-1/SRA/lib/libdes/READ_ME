This directory normally contains the sources for the DES encryption
library.  Under US law, DES software and hardware may not be exported
without license from the US Dept of Commerce, so a file "stubs.c"
with empty stubs for all necessary kerberos libdes functions is
provided as a template in the ./des directory.

Note: with this stub library, all programs will appear to link
successfully, but they WILL NOT RUN CORRECTLY until suitable
code is written or substituted.

One tested and suitable implementation available outside the US is:
	chalmers.se:pub/unix/des/des-2.2.tar.Z

Note: to get this package working with gcc on solaris2, I had to:
1. turn off optimization in Makefile and lib/dea/Makefile
2. disable all listed options in lib/dea/*.cr
3. add wrappers for des_set_random_generator_seed(), and
   des_new_random_key() to call the equivalent supplied
   functions in the chalmers library.

There are undoubtedly other kerberos compatible des libraries
out there as well.

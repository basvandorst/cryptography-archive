Here is how to compile GNU MP.

You probably want to use the GNU C compiler to build this library.
With other compilers the speed of the library will be 3-10 times
slower for many CPU:s.  The reason for this is that the GNU C compiler
will use inline assembler for some important operations, while other C
compilers will have to stick to plain C code.

To build the library, it should be enough to type "make".  If you
don't have GCC, type "make CC=cc".  The compilation should, at least
with GCC, proceed without any kind of warnings from the compiler
programs.

You will get two libraries, "libgmp.a" and "libmp.a".  The former is
the real GNU MP library; the latter is the Berkeley MP compatible
library.

To build and run some tests, do "make test".

The documentation is an a texinfo file, gmp.texi, but since many
people don't have the tools for creating a printable manual from
texinfo files, there is also a file gmp.ps, with Postscript formatted
in US letter format.

To create the documentation from the texinfo source, type "make doc".
This requires the "tex" and "makeinfo" commands to be available in
your search path.  If you have only one of them, you can create the
dvi file (for the paper manual) with "make gmp.dvi", and the info file
(for the GNU online manual facility) with "make gmp.info".

You need version 2.06 or later of texinfo in order to build the
documentation.

Notes of things to fix on the port from BSD to sun:

1. check the Makefiles - these were very quick hacks.
   probably need to check .I and -l for relative paths, and
   fix, and check for other errors.

2. still have include file duplicate definitions.

4. make sure are using all libs from new dist set (particularly
   des, krb, etc.

5. the man page is formatted in bsd macros, and is hopelessly out
   of date.

Anyone who wants to see my money for his or her software better
not implement any copy protection scheme.

I experienced several times that my work came to a grinding
halt because a copy protection stopped my machine by a false
alarm or a machine with serialized software burned and the
replacement machine had the false ids. Of course the software
companies were a great help at providing new serialisation keys
-- after a week of no-work-done and for $$, provided they were
still in the market the day desaster happened.

Did you ever spend a fortnight with a debugger at machine
level, tracking down malevolent code to get a needed piece of
software back on line, the delivery deadline slowly approaching
-- and all this just because an ethernet card broke or someone
upgraded your machine without contacting back to you ("Great,
eh? The new machine is 4 times faster and we even put your old
harddisk back in so you need not to reinstall!")?

Been fucked by Braindead Copy Protection (tm) one time to often,

How about using the public-key/secret-key combination found in things like
PGP?  Use a public-key algorithm to encrypt a secret key.  Then, destroy
all copies of the secret key except the encrypted one on-chip.  This has
the advantage that a secret key algorithm is used for the bulk data
encryption, while the secret key never needs to exist anywhere but in the
CPU (and its encrypted there unless the correct public-key algorithm key is
used.)  Its advantageous to have the bulk data processed with a secret key
alg. since those are typically much faster than public key ones, right?

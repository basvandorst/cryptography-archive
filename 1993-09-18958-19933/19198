It may be much easier to do on the new AV Macs: the Centris 660AV, which
sports an AT&T 3210 DSP chip running at 55MHz, and the Quadra 840AV,
which has the same chip running at 66MHz.  Apple has also implemented what
it calls ARTA (Apple Real Time Architecture) to integrate the DSP
into the existing system.  ARTA allows the DSP to simultaneously execute
isochronous functions (e.g. sound input/output) along with asynchronous
functions (compression, and I would think encryption).  The async functions
would use excess DSP bandwidth and CPU.
 
I haven't gotten the technical docs on ARTA yet, and I know absolutely
nothing about 3210 programming, but it looks to me like these machines
MIGHT be able to pull it off, given a little creative programming. :-)
Of course, the synchronous communciations problem is still there.
You could always make it so only one person could talk at a time,
then switch control of the line to the other side...

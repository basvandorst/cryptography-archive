Fine.  But the other problem about obscurity is that it makes it impossible
to check whether your system is adequately obscure.  For example, consider
your doormat analogy.

Burglars trying a random search will get caught fairly quickly but, if
someone inside the organisation happens to note that the grand master key
happens to be stored under the assistant gopher-catcher's doormat, he then
has an easy loophole.  This information can be either passed on to a
felonious colleague or he can leave and use it himself a while later.  How
many banking frauds have some inside information?

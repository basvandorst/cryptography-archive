Assume that you know the message is in english. The characteristics of
the decrypted message would be easy to recognise with software --
indeed, there has been work done on this problem.

Many financial institutions (gee, wonder why I might know this)
transfer BILLIONS (you heard that right) of dollars a day by wire
using DES as the encryption system. If you could build a DES cracker
that would work in less than half a business day for 10 Million, you
could likely steal enough with it in the rest of the day to make your
job worthwhile.

Even with PEM, there might very well be messages for which the cost is
worthwhile. Also compute power drops in cost dramatically with time --
imagine how cheap this will be in only a few years? Not only does this
bode poorly for software written now, but not all messages lose their
value with time. Lets say that you were a political dissident, say,
and the authorities decided to keep your mail for ten years on the off
chance things would get cheap enough to make it readable...

Agreed, but first, unless steganogrphy is used, it is pretty trivial
to detect automatically that a message is compressed and/or encrypted
by using just frequency analysis and, second, the two communicating
sides should be able to understand each other that they are going to
exchange encrypted messages. Again, this is trivially intercepted.

But we are talking about Internet standards here. You could get an
encrypted message from anywhere, with no prior secret information
exchange - how will your system be able to guess what it was encrypted
with?

The ability to vary the encryption method (e.g., DES, Triple-DES,
IDEA, etc.) from message to message is a good idea, but I don't see
how you can avoid revealing the encryption method.

Aha, you mean to encrypt the information about the encryption method
used with the public key of the recepient, as it is currently done
with the secret keys? Yes, that sounds like a really good idea to me!

But, both PGP and PEM are already doing that!

Why? As you have stated yourself, the simple permutation cyphers are
weak and don't provide further security...

Anyway, I have a fourth proposal.

PROPOSITION IV: A public key encrypted message should not reveal who
     has signed it or who is able to decrypt it.

In fact, it must be perfectly possible to encrypt a message without
signing it at all. Failing to provide the above capabilities, leaves
the system open to traffic analysis. PEM has this problem - you can't
send unsigned messages and the whole world can see who has signed the
message. PGP has this part of the problem fixed, but it still outputs
messages like 'This message can be decrypted only by "Joe Random
<nobody@nohost.noschool.nodomain>"'. IMHO, it should only say "This
message cannot be decrypted with the secret keys in your keyring" -
and the encrypted message should carry only some kind of checksum
packet that allows to verify whether a message is decryptable with a
particular key or not - and not the full ID of the receiver.

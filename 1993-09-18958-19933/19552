Variations of ECC and multi-mappings have been used before.  On the
surface it is considered low-grade and not reliable.  The Soviets have
allegedly used a system similar to this in the past with some field
assets. 

If you look at all mappings for ECC'ed characters with 0 to N bit errors,
patterns will develop even with otherwise legitimate errors.   It flunks
a major  test as it does not effectively address density versus
abberations.

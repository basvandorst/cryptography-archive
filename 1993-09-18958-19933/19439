Well, you may not have been accused publicly of an offense, 
but I assume the federal prosecutor has been or soon will be accusing you
before a grand jury, hoping they'll bill against you.
This seems like *awfully* short notice to have to get a crew of
competent lawyers prepped for a trip to another state,
and since I assume they don't have any evidence that you have yet
*shipped* any products overseas (which would at least give them a platform
to begin making legal arguments about what the law means),
it seems like blatant harassment to me.

On the other hand, as David Sternlight said, you *have* been waving a
red flag in front of a bull; I hope you've got the resources for a
well-prepared defense against the bullshit.

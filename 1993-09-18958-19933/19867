Gosh all the people who were saying I was a fool for suggesting that leaving
the password file world readable was a security hole...

Its nice to know that the people who flammed me for advocating that the
password encrypts should always be read protected are going to admit
that they were wrong and that the jokers who designed Unix "security"
are not necessarily always right.

Attacks like this are not the only ones possible. This one is exhaustive search
of the entire space. If you consider that in calculating f^20 (x) you
are also calculating f^19 (f(x)) optimizations are soon apparent.


The moral is that you apply every method of security you can. Beleiving that
any one single method is sufficient is living in a fools paradise.

Consider that hardware costs tend to fall exponentialy. We have a $20 M 
mainframe that was bought five tyears back and can now be replaced by one
costing $20,000. That suggests that the $1 million crack box could be made for
$10,000 in a few years time...

I can see a whole new industry, consultancy firms you could go to when
you have forgotten your password - very usefull.

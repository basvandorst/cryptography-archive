  Actually, what you describe, as has been discussed here in the last few
weeks, is a deflagration.  A detonation is fundamentally different
physically from a deflagration in that the reaction propagates by means of a
shock wave rather than by thermal means.

  This is the difference between, for example, gunpowder and a high
explosive.

   It was I who posted.  I beleive you are reffering to TWC 3.22.
   [...]
   I dont yet know if an IBM version is possible at the moment, because the
   software relies HEAVILY on certain custom VLSI chips in the Amiga.

You Amiga folks have all the luck! :-)

Actually, there was another product posted, for IBMish systems, from
	"SVC, PO Box 9512, College Station, TX 77842"
costing $250 (+5% for Visa/MC, +8.25% sales tax for Texans.)
It claims to support 386 and up, with SoundBlaster and 14.4K V.42 modem;
486s can do triple-DES.

No idea if it works, or if they're a scam :-), or if it works but
sounds ugly; I haven't seen the brochure they put out.
And there was no email address posted to direct questions to.
Has anybody reached them for more info?

Thanks

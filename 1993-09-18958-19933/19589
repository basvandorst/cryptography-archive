   At CFP '93, Mike Godwin pointed out that the government can and often
   does force a suspect to reveal their accounting books something that
   may -- and that the government hopes will -- incriminate him.

At least one case involves something vaguely related to encryption;
George Gordon, who does common-law and other constitutional things to
annoy the government :-), particularly with respect to drivers
licenses and income tax, was forced to deal with the government
(I think it was the IRS rather than courts, but this is just old memory) 
and bring in his business records; he managed to convince the
inquisitors that the fact that his accountant had done the books in Hebrew 
was their problem and not his, and *he* didn't read it...
and there didn't seem to be any applicable law saying the records had
to be in English.

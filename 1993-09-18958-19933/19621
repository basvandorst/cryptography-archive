   If persons sign an electronic document with PGP, and later decide to
   repudiate that document, they could simply publish the private key they used
   to sign the document and then claim that the document is a forgery.

   In order to protect against such perfidiousness, a neutral third party 
   could date stamp and then sign the document, providing a way to
   verify that the document was signed before the key was published.

(various people have discussed the Bellcore datestamping.)

The problem is that this doesn't do the job.  You need to prove *two* things:
1) That the document existed in that form on that day
	(datestamping does this just fine.)
2) That the private keys used to sign the document had *not* leaked by that day.
	(generally impossible to prove.)

On the other hand, the would-be repudiator *could* use datestamping to
demonstrate that the keys might have been leaked by a given day:
he publishes the note saying
	---BEGIN TIMESTAMPED MESSAGE HERE---TIMESTAMP 04/01/93 01:01:01 GMT----
	From: an12345@anon.penet.fi
	To:   notme@rsl.com (Repudiation Services, Ltd.)
	Subject: Blackmail

	Nyahh, Nyahh, I've got your private key AAAA1234, and your
	passphrase is "trust me".  Send me 10,000,000 digizorkmids
	or your credit rating goes "squish".
	---END TIMESTAMPED MESSAGE---CHECKSUM 32767----
which proves at least that the message traversed the net to the
timestamper service, though of course it doesn't prove that the
anonymous blackmailmailer wasn't really the repudiator himself.

One defense against this is reputations - if the public/private key
pair used by the original signer is the one he uses for *everything*,
he'll be less likely to risk the damage to his reputation and related
ability to make transaction that comes from revealing the key.
(Which means, of course, that nobody will bother committing *small* frauds :-)

I guess that would depend on what the message symbol was determined to be.
Certainly, if the basic element of the stochastic process were a character
such as "a", "e", .etc., then one should certainly consider second and
higher order statistics. Since cryptoanalysis typically involves looking
for common words and preamble symbols, I'm not sure that the message-character
process is a good model.

A couple of months ago someone noted in this group that
Computer Shopper magazine published a bit of toy code to
do encryption in the July 1993 issue.  

Columnist David Stafford produce the program.  The code 
used a simple linear congruece random number generator, 
and due to an error, had a period of only 256, not 2^32
as Stafford had claimed.

I wrote an automatic decryptor which breaks ASCII files
encrypted or double-encrypted with this cipher.  It takes 
a fraction of a second.  I sent it to Computer Shopper
with a cover letter explaining the MANY errors Stafford 
made.  In conclusion I wrote:

> Leave toy ciphers behind and find out about the
> wonderful - and sometimes frightening - developments
> in this important and exciting field.

In the October issue Computer Shopper published my letter-
-almost.  They made a couple minor editorial changes,
introducing one error.

More importantly, they simply omitted the sentence where
I noted the automatic decryptor.

Stafford then did what novices here often do.  He fixed the
one most glaring error, and refused to believe that the other 
flaws I pointed out really make his cipher weak.

Sad, isn't it ?

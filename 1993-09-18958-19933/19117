      It's not entirely clear what the envisaged military use was, but
the US actually built a hand-portable A-bomb, called the "Medium
Demolition Unit", in the late 1950s-early 1960s.  Photos have been
published; it looks like a suitcase-sized unit of '50s military electronics.
Yield around 20KT.

      The smallest A-bomb ever built was grapefruit-sized.  Designed by
Ted Taylor.  See "The Curve of Binding Energy", by John McPhee.

      This degree of compactness took years of nuclear testing and some
theoretical breakthroughs to achieve.  Still, the consensus is that a
truck-portable A-bomb could be built by a terrorist group if they could
get the fissionable material.

      There's also the worry that with the continuing disintegration of the
Soviet Army, some nuclear weapons might get "lost".

      It's a concern.

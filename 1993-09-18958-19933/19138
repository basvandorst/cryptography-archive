	In the case of medium to large LANS I agree with Mr. Murry
as to trying to run a raft of services on one server.  The way to go
is to split services and try to place the diffrent servers on the
net segment that most uses those services.  But that is throughput
opt. not security.

	In the case of smaller LANs the economic reality is that you
have to load multipal services on one server.  The smaller LAN user
is at times hard put even to afford the LAN they have, of course if
it goes away they can't afford that.

	When we consider installing or our clients request a new NLM
we insist on a two week test at our site on the isolated server.  What
I will do is load a copy of the target system; or a general server model,
and the new NLM and then load the server.  We run this for a week or so
with a few workstations making a large number of requests.  If the NLM has
not failed, currupted other code in the server and performed it's tasks
properly we will load it for our customer(s)

Writing one ticket a year, at a random moment, is a lot easier and
cheaper than ticketing consistently. It also leaves us fearful of
surprises, which is why *everybody* slows up driving around cop cars.
This is undoubtedly what the NSA/Customs wants, to chill the field by
failing to define the hazards clearly, and making those hazards
formidable when encountered.

This is an *extremely* common trick by bureaucracies and regulatory
agencies, especially ones responsible for creating the regulations
they enforce. It's also one reason why the creation of, enforcement
of, and judgment of rules should reside in separate bodies, so that no
one body can manipulate the process in this fashion.

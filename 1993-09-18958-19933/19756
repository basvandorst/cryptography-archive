In truth, every common file format I can think of has a simple header.
That's how the Unix "file" program works.  I agree, don't make it
any easier for the spooks than necessary, but steganography (sending
secret messages without seeming to) is very difficult.  Even the low
bits of images and audio samples aren't truly random, while encrypted
output, for all practical purposes (except decryption with the
correct key, of course) is.  If you want to be really good about it,
you have to apply an "uncompression" algorithm to produce reasonable-
looking statistical correlations.

I haven't got the equipment available, but maybe someone with access
to some large samples can compare the frequencies of even/odd pairs.
If you put random data in the low bits, they will of course be very
close to equal.

(Of course, check out Kahn's _The Codebreakers_ for wartime stories of
message-scrambling techniques used to interfere with subliminal
messages.)

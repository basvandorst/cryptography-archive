I believe this to be a classical Sternlight statistical blunder.  If an
exhaustive key search can be done more frequently than the key gets changed,
then the key search cannot be considered sequential.  In this case, we
are discussing a not-so-hypothetical machine than can perform an
exhaustive key search in 7 hours.  If you change your key less frequently
than ever 3.5 hours, then it is no safer than never changing it.

   Another question... Using RSA, would any information be gained

   encrypted with a number of different public keys?

If you have the EXACT same data inside multiple RSA encryptions, and
you knew what those encryptions were, you could probably divine the
message.  However, once you start adding random padding and other
techniques, you limited the vulnerability.  This won't get you the RSA
keys, but it will get you the data inside.

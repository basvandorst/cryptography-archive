Thanks for the clarification.  My understanding was that if you
manufactured something on the ammunition list you would have to register
as an arms dealer.

Here is a part of what you said in response to the text of the letter to ACW.

- cover crypto in their amateur lawyering. It says if you make or export
- something on the munitions list you have to register. It contains no threats

You didn't say as an arms dealer but my understanding was that it was
the only kind of registration with them.

I guess I would have to register as an arms manufacturer if I used
crypto methods in protecting my software from modifications, including
virus protection.

The question still stands, how do I verify the citizenship of the customers?

   With regard to compression, a Sound Blaster does 4:1 compression of digitized
   voice in hardware, so it should be possible to pack an encrypted voice onto
   a 14,400 bps modem.

I've seen this figure periodically, but it never identifies what the
original bit rate is before compression, or the compression algorithm used.
My guess is that "4:1" means one of
- 64 kbps input (8000 samples/sec, mono, 8-bit mu-law coding), ADPCM compression
	=> 16kbps output, which doesn't fit in 14.4, but can fit in 16.8 sync Zyzel
	and might fit into proprietary 19.2 async modems, depending on MNP flavor.
- 128 kbps input (8000 samples/sec, mono, 16-bit linear coding), ADPCM
	=> 32kbps output, which won't even fit in V.fast
- stereo input, probably 2*64 kbps, probably munged into mono 32kbps ADPCM.

Several people have mentioned that the latest SoundBlaster has a DSP
and has some still-hard-to-get development kits; 
speculation has been that the FBI or NSA may have been conspiring to interfere,
but I suspect the "Real Soon Now" phenomenon, or at worst the dreaded
Murphyan Illuminati :-)

Does the first amendment apply to GM in the above case because the
instruction manual puts them in the special category "Publisher" or simply
because it's a form of free speech? This point is important because some of
the arguments being made here by Grady and in his support turn on precedents
involving the distinction "Publisher" as I understand what's been said here,
and not on the general distinction "free speech".

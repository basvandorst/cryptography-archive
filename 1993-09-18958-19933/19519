  Oh, please do....Of course, if the encryption system is good and they can't
break it you might just prove their point that is unsafe for exportation
because of how good it is, and lord knows we can't have that. ;-)
  It is about time that someone stand up agianst the stupid crypto laws that
are one the books. The cold war is over as well as both world wars, so let's
stop acting so damn paranoid about every other country on this planet, and
strat focusing on the citizens and their rights. We are more than willing to
impress our beliefs on every other country, so why the heck don't we share it
all? It's time that we picked a side and stopped trying to come across as the
nice, friendly country who cares about everyone and then just when it is put to
the test showing everyone that we really don't care about anyone but ourselves.

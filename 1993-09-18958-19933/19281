I have PGP, but I am having trouble making out the doc's. 

Can someone tell me how to encypt an entire message, and send it over the internet?

Also, they would also need my 'key' to open it?  - but the only way to get it is 
by emailing that to?  {confused}  If someone can send me the proper format, and
any other related info, please email me.

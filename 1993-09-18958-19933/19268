BZZT!  Wrong!

Yes, RIPEM is legal, but because it used RSAREF, RSADSI's free
implementation of the RSA algorithms.  PGP's possible patent
violations are against PKP, the owner of the RSA patent, not against
RIPEM.

Re: commercial version of PGP, ViaCrypt will be releasing a commercial
version of PGP around November (I think Nov. 1 is the scheduled
release date).  The price will be $100 for a single-user license, and
the price per user goes down with the number of people (I don't have
the full schedule with me.  Ask ViaCrypt for more information).

Hope this helps.!

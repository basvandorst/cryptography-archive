Actually, mass copyright violation of audio recordings has been a crime for
a while.  Recently, the restriction to "audio recordings" has been removed,
and the definition of "mass" has changed to 100 or more copies of value
over $10,000.  (There seems to be some ambiguity whether the total value
has to be more than $10,000, or the value of a single copy is more than
$10,000, in the case of other than "audio recordings".)

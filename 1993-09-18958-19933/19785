The main demagoguery I noticed was the total omission of PGP, of
course.  Following that up, I took a look for IDEA in the document,
only to find the only reference rather disparaging... the message
seemed to be:  "RSA + DES (i.e. RIPEM) is a *great* security system,
while RSA + IDEA (no names mentioned) would be foolish".

Not to disagree with the US-centric focus, of course... it did seem
much like "Well! Why would anyone *want* to export, since then you'd
only be able to talk securely to dem damn-furriners?"

_SOME_ of us are not just posting 'bitch messages' - _some_ of us have
taken the time/trouble to write congresscritters, news outlets, and any
number of other things to bring the situation into the public eye, and
prevent it's recurrence.

Understood - but by letting them know that the government activities in
question are displeasing and considered unfair and oppressive, we can try
to cause these policies to be changed, to some degree.

My reading comprehension level is quite sufficient, thank you.  I did not
mean to imply that you had _directly_ called anyone a fool - but the
majority of your comments in this thread, and responses to other messages,
generally indicate that you think us to be fools.

If our timing and efforts are so wasteful, when would you suggest we raise
the alarm and change course? You seem to consistently comment against some
action or suggestion, but seldom offer definitive answers of your own (see
immediately above).  I doubt that any of us would expect a
date/time-specific answer, but surely you could suggest a combination of
factors and situations where you believe it _would_ be appropriate?  Or are
you one of those who can spot 'flaws', but offer no constructive
alternatives, or create on their own?

Close but no cigar.  The source was a cobalt-60 gamma therapy source
that went to a mexican steel mill.  The radiation detectors were installed
permanently in a weigh station.  The table legs were mildly radioactive
but were not hazardous to bystanders.  And with Co-60 having an approx
5 year halflife and "forever" in nuclear decay being considered 5 to 6
halflives, storage would have been <50 years.  As it happened, the legs
were hauled to Barnwell, NC and buried as low level waste.

More serious was a Co-60 source that made it to a Mexican scrap yard.
The proprietor opened the source and removed the Co-60 powder.  
Entertained by the blue Cerenkov light this "magic dust" gave off,
he took it home to his kids to play with.  Everyone in his family died
of radiation poisoning and several neighbors suffered radiation 
sickness.

To answer the original question, incoming packages are not routinely
inspected for radioactivity, though both the FDA and NEST do spot 
checks.  Getting special nuclear materials into the country would not
be hard, though hiding them from NEST would be.  One would assume that
anyone knowledgable and capable enough to mess with this stuff
would know how to hide it.

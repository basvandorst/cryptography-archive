Nope.  When one considers the Administration's high percentage of 1960's
era 'peaceniks' which, now that they are not liable to be called up in
any draft, or suffer the degree of negative consequences of foolhardy
action the rest of us would, are no longer 'peaceniks' but now are folks
who get an ego stroke from power plays, etc., I would be concerned about
poorly thought-out actions being considered.

I think our military has some ability to block an obviously stupid
order, especially a launch order, but to what degree, I don't know.

It is a worrisome scenerio - a no-winner if I ever saw one.  Let us hope
that those Soviet launch codes are very well done, and will take decades to
crack, even with the best of computer horsepower.  I doubt if the Soviets
used some trivial ecoding method, since the survivial of their country
was dependent on those codes being well done to foil unauthorized launch,
even by knowlegable personnel.  If so, by then the nukes may very
well be next to useless, the unstable initiator sufficiently decayed.  I
do know that warheads do have to be 'freshened up' periodically to remain
viable (this assumes that they are unable to obtain fresh material and
open up the warhead to change the material).

Dr. Jim Omura (ex-TRW) started a company which manufactured chips to do
exponentiation and logs modulo a 32 digit prime. By cascading 10 chips
a 320 digit number could be exponentiated very quickly. This was many
years ago and I don't remember the name of the company. Jim used them
in conjunction with the "Seek" algorithm (Secure exchange of encrypted
data) which was based on exponentiation modulo a prime but not exactly
in the same way as RSA.

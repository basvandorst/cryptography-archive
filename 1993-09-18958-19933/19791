  I think I see where you may be misled. One of the Novice Q (part
of the Tech Plus class test) is:

  Question 2A-31.1: When may an FCC-licensed amateur operator 
       communicate with an amateur operator in a foreign country?

   Answer: (D) At any time unless prohibited by either the US or the foreign
       government. We may speak with every amateur operator in the world. Most
       foreign hams speak English as the common ham radio language. WE ARE NOT
       PROHIBITED from talking with any foreign ham radio operator at this time
       (emphasis mine).

  What is misleading here is that the Q&A is NOT a regulation -- it's only
testing understanding of ham radio operating principles. In _principle_
the US Govt can place any restrictions it wants on ham radio at any time. In
practice, this was done only once, in 1917-1919 during WWI, for perceived
security reasons. There has been no imposition since, and the current regulations
do not prohibit you from talking with any ham in any country. Further, no
foreign laws (according to the FCC) currently exist preventing hams from 
communicating, but even if there were such laws, you aren't violating a US 
law by talking with such a ham -- you're only violating that foreign law. 

  But there aren't any such foreign laws at the moment (and have never been
as far as I know). Note that the FCC's clarification of the answer plainly
states "We are not prohibited from talking with any foreign ham radio operator
at this time."  That should settle the matter.

Talk about brute force... Michael Weiner's chip only compares
the trial encryption to the ciphertext.
It should also compare with the complement of the ciphertext,
doubling the effect speed of each chip (since DES(P, K) ==  DES(~P, ~K)).
But heck, it is fast enough already :-)

Let's see, publishing a do-it-yourself blueprint for a DES breaking machine
in the open literature is okay.
Publishing a book on how to break ciphers such as FEAL, Snefru, ... is okay.
Intent to publish cryptographic privacy/integrity software
results in a Grand Jury investigation.
I think there is a trend in there somewhere.

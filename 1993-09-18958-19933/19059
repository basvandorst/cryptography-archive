Does anyone out there know Algebraic Logic?
Has anyone explored the use of Algebraic Logic in Cryptography?
Although Algebraic Logic existed before my time, I discovered it through my 
own application of the fundementals of abstract algebra to logic....I'm not
very knowledgeable in abstract algebra yet, but I know enough to have
figured out the system of Algebraic Logic...
    What do you know about Algebraic Logic?

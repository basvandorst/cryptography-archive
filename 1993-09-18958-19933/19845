Some basic facts, to help this discussion:

It's counterintuitive, but true, that changing the key often is of no
help against the enemy who is attacking your encryption method with
exhaustive search.

The reason is that your opponent's exhaustive search will try every key
with an equal 'Probability'. So no matter what the key happens to be at
any point in time, the 'Probability' of the exhaustive search trying it
is the same.

This in fact is why I see no point in changing my login password every
so often, as security-related documents often advise.  If I have a good
password that hasn't yet been guessed, changing it hinders me (need to
spend time changing it, then expend effort remembering it) and doesn't
bother my opponent at all.  He just goes right on trying to guess, with
the same probability of success.

Changing your encryption key does help you against the enemy who has
already discovered the key.  Change it when you believe it may have
been compromised.  Otherwise don't bother -- it's too much effort for
no gain.

=====
Note:  'Probability' refers to the probability as calculated by you,
without knowledge of the exhaustive search sequeunce used by the
opponent.

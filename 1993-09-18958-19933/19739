WordPerfect has a new encryption procedure in 6.0.  Although I have
not spent much time investigating, I did find :

- My WordPerfect 5.x password cracker fails,

- The size of a file now increases when encrypted,

- Two exact copies of the same file, encrypted under
  the same password will produce different ciphertexts,

- The manual now warns that password protection is not
  intended for high security applications.

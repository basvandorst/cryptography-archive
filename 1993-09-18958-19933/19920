When you make the statement "DES is dead" you have to be careful.
Specifically, who/what is your threat environment?  It seems to be a
safe bet that if the NSA wanted, they could crack a DES key in 10
minutes.  So if your goal is to keep out foreign intelligence agencies,
DES is certainly not sufficient.  However, if your goal is to keep out
the Chaos Computing Club, or your overly-inquisitive students, it's
probably still good enough (for the moment).

Keep in mind that to date, no one has publically admitted to actually
building one of these machines; and for 10 million dollars, an attacker
can probably find some other way to get access to your machines which
you are protecting using Kerberos --- for example, he could probably
bribe their way into most machine rooms for a lot less.  :-)

That being said, Kerberos V5 has provisions for using alternative
encryption technologies other than DES.  This is currently not
implemented, but it would be pretty easy to add support for triple-DES,
IDEA, and/or DES+IDEA.  Triple-DES is probably the most likeliest, since
commercial use of IDEA will require paying some sort of royalty, while
triple-DES does not.

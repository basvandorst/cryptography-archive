The fax was a last-minute thing. It wasn't even addressed to the authorities
who summoned them to the Grand Jury, but to someone at the NSA. Now some may
see some Machavellian NSA directing this play-by-play, but I don't believe
that's how it works, and what's more the NSA has no role in enforcing the
ITAR--that's up to the FBI, Justice Department, etc. Thus it can be argued
that the fax was irrelevant to the subpoena.

Second, we have no idea what evidence the government has, nor what or who
they're actually investigating. It is common for someone who might have some
evidence about someone else committing a crime to be subpoenaed to appear,
often with records and documents. I think some of the reaction I've seen
here has been a mixture of conspiracy theory, paranoia, and unthinking
panic. We won't know what's actually going on until the Grand Jury acts (if
it does). There's little that can be done until then, and plenty of time to
involve oneself afterwards if they do return an indictment anyone thinks
"wrong."

Not quite. Malice is not yet at issue. See above.

This was criminal behavior (in my view) of a small number of police acting
under color of authority. My guess is they'll do time and there'll be
compensation if the heirs can afford the legal fees (or the ACLU gets
interested). Of course it's horrible, and it won't bring the dead back to
life. But it wasn't a "government conspiracy." And it bears little
relationship to the grand jury process we're discussing here.

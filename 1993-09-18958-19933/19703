Hello!

I know that most readers of this newsgroup are Americans, and that
theÚ¶Ûïre is considerable interest in the political case involving the
Clipper chip among cryptographers. I must however remind you that
there is a CLIPPER group on Usenet, and crossposting to this group
is a waste of bandwidth and other reader's time.

Please, let there be more general crypto speak and less politics.

Just my $.02 worth.

Kind regards
Jan S. Haugland

I went to a book store today to see about ordering the new Hinsley book
that was mentioned here recently. ("Codebreakers: The Inside Story of
Bletchley Park"  F. H. Hinsley and Alan Stripp, eds.; ISBN 0-19-820327-6)

According to the store's computer, looking up on that ISBN, the title
for U.S. distribution has been changed to (approximately) "Memories of
Bletchley Park" and it won't be available until October.

The computer also gave us another title that I intend to look into:
 Codebreaking and signals intelligence / edited by Christopher Andrew.  London
    ; Totowa, NJ : F. Cass, 1986.

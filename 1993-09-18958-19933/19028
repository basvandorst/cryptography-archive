Keywords: compression

Can anyone point me to some references on various voice compression
techniques?  Specifically, refs which describe the algorithms in 
enough detail to allow implementation.  Also useful would be any
pointers to code (DSP or otherwise) which implemented such algorithms.
Please respond via e-mail.  If there is enough interest, I will post
a compilation of responses received.  Thanks in advance.

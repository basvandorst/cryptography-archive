   Perhaps I made myself misunderstood.  FastBack is not copy-protected.
I made an encrypted backup of my hard drive (selected their encryption
option) and forgot the password (horrors!  I _never_ do that!).  They
willingly offered to undo the damage, but it would take two weeks or so
and I didn't want to wait.
   I found out later that FastBack 3.0 ignores the encryption altogether.

   You're right there.  Reverse-engineering is perfectly legal, according
to the Supremes.  (I didn't go _that_ far, though I could have; I did
what I needed to do to get what I needed off my disks.)

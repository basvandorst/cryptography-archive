Note that failure to reveal that a recording is being made, depending on
the circumstances and depending on the jurisdictions involved, may
amount to an illegal wiretap and make the hole he's trying to get out of
just that much deeper.  Covert recordings are tricky; anyone who makes
one without obtaining professional advice from a lawyer familiar with
this area of law and licensed to practice in the jurisdiction in
question, is definitely asking for trouble.  You may be asking for
trouble anyway--but at least if you get proper legal advice first,
you'll know what kind and degree of trouble you're facing.

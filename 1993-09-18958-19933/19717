The fundamental assumption of cryptography: the security of the system
lies only in the keys.

Don't worry about the enemy noticing that you're exchanging encrypted
messages; they're going to try to read whatever you send anyway, just
because you're the one who sends it.

Don't worry about the enemy knowing what cipher system you're using;
if it's strong enough then they are helpless without the key.

Don't worry about trivialities like the encoding into ASCII; if
that was part of the cipher then you'd analyze it as such.

All the issues you've mentioned are irrelevant to real security.

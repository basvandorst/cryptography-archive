V.42bis is not likely to help even on unencrypted voice. V.42bis
compression is designed for text, and performs very poorly on PCM voice.

To compress voice sufficiently for transmission over dialup modems,
you use *lossy* compression in the form of a vocoder (voice
coder). There are many such algorithms, and in general the better ones
(like CELP) are very compute intensive. CELP can produce excellent
speech at 9.6kb/s or lower, but it requires (with current technology)
a dedicated DSP. Even modern general purpose CPUs like 486s aren't
enough - yet.

You *can* get acceptable voice quality with a fast general purpose CPU
by going to a higher data rate (13 kb/s) and sacrificing some voice
quality.  I'm thinking of the GSM vocoder here, which has found some
use for compressing Internet Talk Radio files.

The voice coder is *the* critical technology in a homebrew secure phone
designed for widespread use. Everything else - the modem and CPUs
capable of encrypting in real time - are already available at any
retail computer store.

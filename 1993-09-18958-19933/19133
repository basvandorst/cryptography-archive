   I'm ex-Navy, and always heard "Puzzle Palace" as a reference to the
   5-sided Asylum on the Potomac, not NSA as your message seems to say....

Bamford's book "The Puzzle Palace" was about the NSA.
On the other hand, how long ago were you in the Navy?  
No Such Agency was based in the Pentagon until it moved to Ft. Meade
sometime around 1954.

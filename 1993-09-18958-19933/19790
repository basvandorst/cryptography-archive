Actually, it may well be some bureacrat honestly believes he is doing
his/her
job. Or alternatively, consider the following:

In most large organizations lower level bureaucrats/managers do not have the
authority to say "yes". Instead they can say "no", leaving it up to you to
try
and get their manager to reverse the decision. Often, there are several
layers
between the level that can say "no" and the level that can say "yes".

Applying this concept to the NSA, I would expect that senior management
having
the authority to say either "yes" or "no" emphasizes need for security to
junior
level people. This would imply a tendency to say "no" over "yes" in case of
doubt.

In this context, I am using "yes" to mean the abiltiy to commit the
organiztion
to do actively do something and a "no" to be passively maintaining the
status quo.

Bill

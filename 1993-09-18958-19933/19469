  Technically it has not.  The Supreme Court has always upheld the
right of the government to draft militia in cases of war or national
emergency.  Nixon did not manage to end WWII, but he did manage to
clean up several other conflicts and states of emergency, some of
which had been hanging around for a long time.  (I think the list
included World War I, the Spanish-American War, the Korean conflict,
and Viet Nam among others.)  Now that World War II is also officially
over, the only war or state of emergency active that I know of is the
Gulf War.  Clear that up, and you might have a chance.  (For those of
you interested in such things, the Gulf War resolution was not
technically a declaration of war, but an ultimatum which delegated to
the President the determination of whether or not Iraq complied with
the requirements.  Once the President determined they hadn't, a state
of war existed, and can only be ended by Senate approval of a treaty.
The reason WWI hung around so long was that the Senate rejected the
treaty because they didn't want to surrender any sovereignty to the
League of Nations.)

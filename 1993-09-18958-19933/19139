	This weapon was designed to be carried by combat eng. units and
spc. forces to take out bridges, bunkers, and other VERY hard targets.
The 'users' were to have pre-dug a bunker a mile or so from the target
and return to that spot after setting a timer on the weapon.

	It required (sic) two officers each with codes to arm, but that
was '50 tech and I am sure the PAL's on those weapons could be defeted 
today.  My understanding is that they were all destroied in the '70 after
being stored for 15-20 just on the other side of Sunrise Mt. near Las
Vegas, at Nellis AFB area 2.

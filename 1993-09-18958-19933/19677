I know you use a different brand of logic to the rest of us, but lets
take a detailed look at one sentence:

  `He claims to be a law professor'

You will no doubt claim this is a neutral comment and that I'm reading
something into it that is not there, but the word `claims' clearly implies 
you believe that he either is not a law professor (and therefore a liar) or
is not competent to be one.

  `[...] is making arguments that to me are inconceivable from a law
   professor.'

Again you imply that, since it is inconceivable to you that such arguments
could come from a law professor, that either he is fraudulently claiming to
be so, or is incompetent to hold that position.

That's really amusing - that's the justification most people would use for
flaming you.

Substance?  Your postings seem to concentrate on the unsubstantiated and
the insubstantial.

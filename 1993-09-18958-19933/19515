Getting older is risky.  Having any opinion is risky.  I deem the greater
risk to our country and rights as social animals comes from being silent on
important problems. Our distinct individuality should become a distributed
strength, not a fragmented weakness.

: YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO AN ATTORNEY:
: Let him/her talk for you.  You can always deny/fire/redirect them or
: their statements.

Humans should have the ability to understand, comply with, and argue against
laws governing them without needing the intermediation of an attorney.

: ANYTHING YOU SAY CAN AND WILL BE USED AGAINST YOU IN A COURT OF LAW:
: And possibly other places.  A lunch says you'll see some of your net
: traffic again...

Please quote me something that I should be ashamed of.

: Many have learned this the hard way.

Many more have benefited because a few learned the hard way.


: Best wishes.

Wishes are an essential part of preparation.  But action achieves the goal.

This sounds like:

 W54       1 Kiloton (M-159/W-54)  Atomic Demolition Munition (ADM)
                                   Land Mine - Man Portable, total weight
                                   150 lbs (59 lbs being the W-54) can be 
                                   emplaced by two-man team.
                                   In active service.

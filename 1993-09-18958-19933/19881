Micheal Weiner's idea is exciting - here is some feedforward 
of course these are not published ideas yet - but then they are 
exciting to hold on till mood sets in for a paper. - but will 
summarize for the net

==================OptiCryptBreaker==================================
Given a fiber of 10nm diameter, in a square face of 1sq mt. one can fit in
10^16 tubes (packaging idunno unanswered).  If our 1sq mt. face is 1mt 
long, we have a fiber length of 10^16 meters.  For a wavelength of 1um this
gives a storage space (storing in waves) of 10^22 waves.

(We still have to figure out the attenuation solutions and chaining
of these fiber strands.  )

Then with enough coding bits for flags and addresses 
we have a storage media that is sequential, with multiple taps across 
the whole fiber length/boundary we have a potential (psuedo)random access
capability. (even the latency is solvable, after all at 2*10^8 mt/sec
speed we have 10^14 (8+6)i+6) bits streaming by every 1 second).  We could, 
perhaps use some interference phenomina to compare a string of our data
with that flowing in the fiber.  Assume we have such a storage space. - now

Consider the storage capacity needed for storing a single cleartext
word encrypted with all the possible combinations of the key.  For our
56bit keys (10^17 combinations) and 64 bit words this is in the order 
of 10^19.  So now we can store this much data in waves.

Now consider how we could generate "what to store".  One year has about
10^7 seconds.  With a 100Mbps processing capability ~10^6 enc/dec per second 
in about 10^4 years we will have one word encrypted with all key combinations
and can store them.  Or we could rig up a machine with 10^4 such 100Mbps
DES processors and get this dump in one year. Or we could use internett
processing power for may be a shorter time.

Now if a user can be induced to encrypt a standard word or phrase,
we can get into business.  Infact our standard representations, such as
security "labels" or EDI "codes" sort of give this capability already.

Isn't that a crazy - may be our exhausitve search 
boundaries have to be pushed further.

Punch on replies if it sounds exciting - will summarize

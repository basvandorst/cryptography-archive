Hello!

I'm so sorry for novice-like question, but could anybody advice me
how to evaluate quality of permutation-based ciphers?

Traditional way (Shennon etc.) is connected with evaluation of
statistical characteristics of input and output data flows,
but in case of plaintext characters permutation, the frequency of
each character in chiphertext is the same than in plaintext.

Could the mean distance between original and final location
of character be considered as math. expection in Shennon's formulas?

Sincerely, Dmitry.

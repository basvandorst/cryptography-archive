Once again I must ask Peter for help in understanding his arguments, which
leave me at a complete loss. The regs define descriptions of algorithms,
flow charts, source code and object code as defense articles. Further, the
regs exclude them from exemption as "technical data". It would seem to me
that thus a claim of being a publisher is so much nonsense for this specific
material. That is certainly State's interpretation and they wrote the regs
and are charged with interpreting them.

If Junger is making an argument of the form "shouldn't be" then it does not
represent an interpretation of the law, but his ideological position. If he
is making an argument of the form "isn't" then I don't understand how his
argument can be accurate. I'd like to understand his position better, but as
in the past I cannot. 

What is more, some of his past assertions have been directly refuted by the
text of the State Department letter.

Again, I am in considerable difficulty in another respect. He claims to be a
law professor but once more is making arguments that to me are inconceivable
from a law professor and reflect a heedless lack of specificity, citation,
and clarity I have come to associate with law professors. Rather, his
arguments read to me (and I could very well be misinterpreting them) like
the special pleadings of a party at interest rather than the authoritative
statements of a law professor. Dunno--maybe it's me.

At Crypto 93, Michael Wiener gave a paper with the above title.  He
showed how a DES key search engine could be built for $1 million which
can do exhaustive search in 7 hours.  Expected time to find a key from a
matching pair of 64-bit plaintext and 64-bit ciphertext is 3.5 hours.

So far as I can tell, the machine is scalable, which implies that a
$100M machine could find keys every couple of minutes or so.

The machine is fairly reliable: an error analysis implies that the mean
time between failure is about 270 keys.

The final sentence in the abstract is telling:

	In the light of this work, it would be prudent in many
	applications to use DES in triple-encryption mode.


I only have portions of a virtually illegible FAX copy, so please don't
ask me for much more detail.  A complete copy of the paper is being
snailed to me.

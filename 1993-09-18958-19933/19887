At Michigan State, the Computer Science dept machines (at least; I
don't know about others), require the following rules for passwords:

	* At least 5 characters long
	* At least 2 characters must be uppercase
	* At least 2 characters must be lowercase
	* A word cannot be bracketed by the same case (eg : SomethinG
	  is not legal under this system, nor is sOMETHINg)
	* At least one punctuation character is preferred, but not
	  required.

A step in the right direction, I think. (Except that it took me 5
tries to find a PW I would remember and which follows these rules). A
friend of mine was saying that on her system, the machine keeps a
record of the last password you used, and will not let you change back
to the old password for 60 days after you change it.

I am putting together the source code disk to accompany my book, Applied
Cryptography.  This is what is on the disk so far:

	idea.zip
	newdes.zip
	haval
	ripe-md
	crypt1
	nhash
	feal8
	feal-nx
	enigma
	shs 
	khufu
	loki.zip
	ca
	lucifer
	md5.zip
	rsa-ref.zip
	viegnere
	wpcrack.zip
	sharing
	redoc2
	redoc3
	mimic.zip
	itar.zip

I am looking for suggestions of other things to put on the disk.  I think I
have all the code (I will include pointers about where to get PGP and PEM)
I can legally use, but there are probably more documents I can include.  The
only caveat is that I need ASCII versions, since the disk is supposed to be
the lowest common denominator.  Suggestions, or better yet, copies of the
files, would be appreciated.

For those who don't yet know, Applied Cryptography will be published in
November by John Wiley & Sons.  The price (last I heard) is $45, and it
is about 700 pages long.  There's a lot in it.  The ISBN number is:

	ISBN 0-471-59756-2

When the book is finally published, I will post a notice on this newsgroup,
including a table of contents.

There's a lot of room on this disk.  There's no reason not to fill it up
with data.

Thanks,
Bruce

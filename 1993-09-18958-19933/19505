What we need is a law forcing the police or FBI to disclose upon whom they've been spying.  Even if they were permitted to make unknown wiretaps, they should
not be permitted to do it forever on the same person without pressing 
charges.  So, for example, after 60 days they would have to tell you that you
were spied upon and that they were sorry to have invaded your privacy, since
your obviously not a criminal.  

This would cut down on "fishing trips" by embarassing the FBI for tapping
everything in sight when the people taped were innocent.

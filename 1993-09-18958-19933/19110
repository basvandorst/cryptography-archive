I followed this same path earlier this year.  I would have thought that
different length coax cables to the detonators would be used.  Playing with
delays could also be used for "dial-a-yield".  You could also hide delays 
inside a tamper-proof chip, requiring different length coax delays.  It would
require at a minimum, replacing the entire firing circuitry.  How about hiding delays
in detonators as well?  Getting detonators to fire reliably is probably a
fine science as well, requiring matching batches.  The explosives used in
implosion lenses is supposed to be immune to cookoff in a fire.  What about
using different explosives with different speeds?

The timing accuracy has been described in the sub-microsecond range (I remember
one reference to 2 nsec).  Modern technology would allow something close to 
the sub-nanosecond today.

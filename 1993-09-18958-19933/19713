Herein lies the rub.  The source code in question is *not* a "device"
(or even "software") any more than a mathematical description, or an
English-text description of the algorithm.  All of the descriptions are
equivalent (assuming they're described properly), they merely use different
notations.

The idea that the difference in notation makes a difference as to whether or
not the expression is protected is ridiculous.  It's analogous to saying,
"You have the right to speak in English, but not in German."

So, expressing a cryptography algorithm in Pascal or C (or any other
programming language) *is* just another form of expression.

For the government to argue that such expression were somehow unprotected
by the first amendment, it would have to make some kind argument that the
information expressed was protected by national security interests.

But this notion is ridiculous.  From what I understand, source code for
the RSA cryptosystem is at the heart of this.

But there cannot be any legitimate interest in regulating the export of
*information* on the RSA cryptosystem.  Over the last 15 years, the details
of the cryptosystem have been widely published in all kinds of academic
materials throughout the world (journals, conference proceedings, books).

Hell, my introduction to RSA came from a monograph written by an author
in Belgium, printed in Germany, and then imported to the US.

What's more, the damn algorithm is *patented*, which means that it has
specifically been made public, in order to protect the patent-owner's
rights.

*This* is Grady's point.  What he has put together is a clear form of
protected expression.  There are no "devices."  There are no legitimate
"secrets" to be concealed on the basis of national security interests.

If the DTC regulates this type of expression, then it is clearly
unconstitutional.

I need some suggestions, hints, tips whatever.
First, I have an Amiga computer (not IBM Compitable, thank good), so any
software suggestions must be for Amiga.
(For those unfamiliar with the amiga speed: My amiga is using a Motorola
68030 CPU (mc68030), I guess it is speedwise somewhere between a 80386DX
and a 80486DX)

I need something which will crypt and decrypt using one key, realtime
and be quite secure. I need something which uses pipelining, to crypt/decrypt
one Charter a time, and not the whole file at once.
It should be something which I can install somewhere between my 
HD and the Modem (:-), any suggestions anyone ?
I would greately apreciater ANY help, ideas, software etc.

All best, Michael

The name of the company is Cylink.  We have two general purpose devices
for performing modular arithmetic.  The first handles operands up to 
 518-bits in length.  The second handles operands up to 1028-bits in length 
and may be cascaded to handle moduli up to 16,384 bits long.

For a 1028-bit modulus, a single exponentiation with randomly chosen operands
takes approximately 550 milliseconds when using a 12 MHz clock.  We do,
however, have parts that run up to 30 MHz if you're in a real hurry :-)

If anyone wants more info, email or call me directly at Cylink.

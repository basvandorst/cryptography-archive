Are the State Department regulations overboard? Here is a bit
of the case law on overboard regulation of expression.

- Carl "not a lawyer" Kadie

[From _Doe v. University of Michigan_, 721 F. Supp. 852 (E.D. Mich. 1989)]

 B. Overbreadth
                                      1.
 [4] Doe claimed that the Policy was invalid because it was facially
overbroad.  It is fundamental that statutes regulating First Amendment
activities must be narrowly drawn to address only the specific evil at hand.
Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 611, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 2915, 37 L.Ed.2d 830
(1973).  "Because First Amendment freedoms need breathing space to survive,
government may regulate in the area only with narrow specificity."  NAACP v.
Button, supra 371 U.S. at 433, 83 S.Ct. at 845-46.  A law regulating speech
will be deemed overbroad if it sweeps within its ambit a substantial amount of
protected speech along with that which it may legitimately regulate.  Id. 413
U.S. at 612, 93 S.Ct. at 2915;  Houston v. Hill, 482 U.S. 451, 458-60, 107
S.Ct. 2502, 2507-08, 96 L.Ed.2d 398 (1985);  Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352,
359 n. 8, 103 S.Ct. 1855, 1859 n. 8, 75 L.Ed.2d 903 (1983);  Gooding v. Wilson,
405 U.S. 518, 521-22, 92 S.Ct. 1103, 1105-06, 31 L.Ed.2d 408 (1972).

[From: _UWM Post v. Board of Regents of University of Wisconsin_,
774 F.  Supp. 1163 (E.D. Wis. 1991)]

A. OVERBREADTH

Plaintiffs first argue that the UW Rule is invalid because it is
facially overbroad.  It is fundamental that statutes regulating First
Amendment activities must be narrowly drawn to address only the
specific evil at hand.  Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 611
(1973).  "Because First Amendment freedoms need breathing space to
survive, government may regulate in the area only with narrow
specificity."  NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. 4151 433 (1963).

*6 In spite of the above, the Supreme Court has held that "the
overbreadth doctrine is 'strong medicine" ' and that it should be
employed "with hesitation, and then 'only as a last resort.' "  See
New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, 769 (1982) (quoting from Broadrick
at 613). only a statute that is substantially overbroad may be
invalidated on its face.  Ferber at 769.  A statute should not be
"held invalid on its face merely because it is possible to conceive of
a single impermissible application ... ' 'Houston v. Hill, 482 U.S.
451, 458 (1987) (quoting from Broadrick, 630 (Brennan, J. dissenting)).

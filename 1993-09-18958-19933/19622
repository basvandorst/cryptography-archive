I am interested in getting opinions about chosen-plaintext
attacks. Specifically I am interested in what people
consider to be a reasonable length (in plaintext characters)
and/or reasonable amount of time for a chosen-plaintext
attack to take on an arbitrary cryptosystem.

What would be an acceptable maximum length for the
forseeable future?

In addition, many chosen-plaintexts involve choosing messages
with various structure. Is it usual to impose any limitation
on the structure of a chosen-plaintext?

Please e_mail to me directly and I'll post a summary if there
is enough interest.

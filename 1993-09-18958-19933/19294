Shannon's model shows XOR-based code is unbreakable IF and ONLY IF
cryptoanalysist uses "chiphertext only" attack (enemy knows encrypted
data, but not decrypted source).

If plaintext is known, it's too simple to obtain psevdo-random sequence,
which could be used to decrypt other your messages, encrypted with the
same key. If so, it doesn't matter which pseudo-random generator you use.

How about:
  It is not yet against the law to possess source code to PGP, the world's
  foremost freely available encryption application in the United States.

Well, actually, it could be (1) a Federal prosecutor trying to intimidate
Grady with the threat of prosecution, without actually any intention to
prosecute; (2) as the message didn't say it was a criminal investigation,
it could be the Grand Jury, on it's own, or with strong hints from a
Federal prosecutor, trying to decide whether there is something indictable.

The Grand Jury, for instance could indict PKP or R for export violation, or
PKP for restraint of trade in attempting to enforce a clearly invalid
patent, or, I agree, Grady.

As for the rest, the ACLU _SHOULD_ assist Grady, as it is clearly a Freedom
of Speech case, but he may have to settle for EFF.

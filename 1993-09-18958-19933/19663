That's correct - if you are a manufacturer of cryptographic devices or
software that is covered under the Defense Trade Controls, then you must
register as such.  However, if you are not sure your device or software
is covered by the DTC, you can write to them requesting a commodity
jurisdiction as stated in the letter below to determine if the device or
software is under DTC jurisdiction or the jurisdiction of the Dept. of
Commerce.

No, it does not literally imply any such thing.  The description in ITAR
is pretty specific and follows the context of electronic equipment or
software.  Although if the de/coder ring manufacturer is in doubt, they
can always write a letter to the Defense Trade Controls stating why they
feel they are exempt or ask for a commodity jurisdiction determination.

Once again, I think you are overracting since the only people or
companies that must register are the manufacturers or exporters of
cryptographic equipment, not the users of such equipment.  By the way,
software designed or modified to protect against malicious computer
damage (e.g. viruses) is not considered cryptographic software according
to ITAR 121.1 Category XIII (b) (1) (ix).

Well it's not exactly a new twist.  The history of U.S. defense trade
controls goes back to public concern over profiteering from armamants in
the 1930s.  The 1935 passage of the _Neutrality Act_ empowered the
Secretary of State to set up an Office of Arms and Munitions Controls,
with authority to register and issue export licenses to all U.S.
entities engaged in defense-related trade.  Both the _Mutual Security Act
of 1954_ and the _Arms Export Control Act of 1976_ elaborated and
expanded the role of the Department of State.  These laws, and Executive
orders affecting defense trade, form the authority and foundation of the
Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Title 22, Foreign Relations.

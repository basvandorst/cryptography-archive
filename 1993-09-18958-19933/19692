I don't want to put words in anyone's mouth, but it seems there is a 
possibility that you are overlooking.  Namely, that you are correct
in your interpretation of the regs, but that the regs are 
*unconstitutional*.

Just because the government creates a regulation does not mean that 
it will survive judicial scrutiny.  Would you argue that an analogous
argument from Peter Junger was "special pleading" if the regulation
in question was one you believed to be unconstitutional?

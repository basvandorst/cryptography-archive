Actually I was more interested in whether text had been modeled strictly as
Markov processes.  "U often follows Q" and "E often follows TH" are
vague heuristics.  It's pretty obvious that there would have been work
done in that direction.  I'm wondering how far in that direction did such
work go, and to what ends.  Thanks for your wonderfully informative and
cordial response.

Michael Froomkin describes the practice in which a firm gets a formal
opinion letter from counsel, and relies on it if it says the regulations
aren't worth the paper they're printed on.

There are two problems with applying this to the present discussion:

First, we've got people here typing conversational messages, not issuing
formal opinion letters they'd have to be able to defend before the bar
association and take responsiblity for. It's more like "let's you and him
fight" than it is "I'll stake my professional reputuation on...." and
perhaps even "indemnify you for.. If I'm wrong" Further, no counsel worth
his salt would issue such a letter unless he were qualified to practice and
experienced in the domain of the specific regulations. He would not "wing
it" I would think, based on a horseback interpretation of the language of
the Constitution and maybe a precedent or two he remembers that are
distantly related to the current facts.

Second, a business would not take such a risk unless the costs of the
opinion letter and the benefits from acting on it were much more financially
valuable than the penalties if he were wrong. (Like you, I except the case
of a philosophical challenge to some regulations on principle from this
comment.)

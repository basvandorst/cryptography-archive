In article <strnlghtCDKx2C.9nt@netcom.com> strnlght@netcom.com (David Sternlight) writes:
   Not only does the state have to establish the facts of a felony, 
   but also intent.  If they can, the case goes to trial. 
   If they can't it's all over.  Since this is a Federal case, 
   I think they only get one shot at the Grand Jury, though I could be wrong.

I'm pretty sure you're wrong (Constitutionally you are; the grand jury
accusations don't place you in jeopardy, so double jeopardy doesn't apply;
only a trial does that.  But there may be Federal rules of legal procedure
that would prevent that, though I'm inclined to doubt it.  I suspect
that at minimum, they can drag you or your "unindicted co-conspirators"
into court in many different Federal districts and jurisdictions 
and keep hauling you around the country, and they can do it any time
you do something new and interesting, until they abuse you enough that
you can sue them, which takes quite a lot of abuse.)

In this case, I suspect it will be easier to establish intent
(since you're clearly challenging their interpretations of the law)
than it will be to establish facts (since you have to actually ship
something outside the US/Canada to violate the export laws),
though maybe they can try to conjure up some sort of conspiracy accusation.

(Like Mr. Sternlight, I'm not a lawyer, though I have played a politician on TV

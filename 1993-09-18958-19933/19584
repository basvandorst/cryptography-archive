The key to this issue is whether or not Austin Code Works (don't know Mr.
Ward, so no first name familiarity) "knows" that the secondary entity
("consignee"), probably a freight forwarding company, plans to export the
proscribed materials without proper licensing.  An originating company
does not relieve itself of responsibilities for adhering to export
regulations when it goes through a freight forwarding firm, it merely
signs away its powers of attorney to others who fill in the blanks on the
Customs forms.  In my humble layman's opinion, Ward's statements show a
clear intent to circumvent the licensing process.

I leave the question of the restriction's propriety and effectiveness as
an exercise for the reader...

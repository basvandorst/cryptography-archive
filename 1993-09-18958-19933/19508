(please edit follow-ups)

In a fresh (to me, stunning) development, the Austin Code 
Works received a letter today (Tuesday 9/21/93) from the 
State Department, Bureau of Politico Military Affairs, Office of 
Defense Trade Controls advising them, in part, of their need to 
register as an International Arms Trafficker *even if* their 
crypto material is intended solely for *domestic* publication, 
regardless of whether they are selling executables, source, 
descriptions, algorithms of any crypto (and presumably viral 
detection) software or documentation, as defined by ITAR.
 
This requirement literally implies that a Cereal manufacturer is 
required to register as an arms trafficker if it wants to include 
a secret de/coder ring in the box, has a cardboard outline of a 
de/coder printed on the box, or even a description how to 
construct or use a de/coder ring.
 
Complete text of the letter follows:

Dear Sir:
 
It has come to the attention of this office that your company is 
making cryptographic source code and technical data available 
for commercial export claiming a technical data exemption 
from the International Traffic in Arms Regulations.  
Cryptographic software, including source code, is a munitions 
article as defined in 22 CFR # 120.1, category XIII(b).  Further, 
the exemptions listed in 22 CFR # 125.4 for technical data do 
not apply to cryptographic software and source code.  A valid 
Department of State license is required to export cryptographic 
source code.  As such, it would be a violation of the 
International Traffic in Arms Regulations to export 
cryptographic source code without a valid Department of State 
export license.
 
We take this opportunity of advise you that any company or 
individual who engages in the United State in the business of 
either manufacturing or exporting defense articles or 
furnishing defense services is required to register for a fee 
with the Office of Defense Trade Controls (DTC) pursuant to 22 
U.S.C. # 2778(b)(1)(A) and 22 C.F.R. Part 122.  Furthermore, the 
export of such defense articles and related technical data must 
be licensed by the Department of State in accordance with 22 
U.S.C # 2778(b)(1)(B)(2) and 22 D.F.R. Parts 120-130 
(International Traffic in Arms Regulations).  A booklet entitled 
"REGISTRATION: The First Step in Defense Trade" is enclosed.
 
If you are unsure whether an article is on the U.S. Munitions 
List, you may send five (5) copies of descriptive literature 
about the product and request a commodity jurisdiction 
determination from this office according to 22 C.F.R # 120.5 of 
the ITAR.
 
If you have any questions regarding the matters discussed in 
this letter, please do not hesitate to contact this office at (703) 
875-6650.
 
Sincerely,
 
(signed) Clyde G. Bryant, Jr., Chief
Compliance and Enforcement Branch

I guess this means that all FTP sites who implement the GET 
command and have anything to do with crypto or viral detection, 
including RFCs, overviews or discussions of specific techniques 
or algorithms, etc. must be registered as International Arms 
Traffickers *even if* they disallow all but domestic FTP 
connections.
 
What to do now.
 
My advice to this new twist of the NSA and State Department 
regulating activities *within* the United States is twofold:
 
(1) GET and FAMILIARIZE yourself with PGP sources or other crypto 
options NOW and upload it to your local BBS (if you deem it still
legal for you to do these things) and
 
(2) Consider supporting the Electronic Freedom Foundation.

Criminal law is far from my strong suit (ask me about the Administrative
Procedures Act!) but from what I recall "selective enforcement" is just fine,
but discriminatory enforcement is not.  An illustration may help:  if the cops
want, they can set up a road block to stop cars and check for drunk driving. 
They can, if they wish, stop every car.  Or they can stop every Nth car.  Or
they can stop cars according to some predetermined random process.  But they
cannot stop only red cars, or cars driven by young folks, or folk of a
particular race.

Similarly, the fact that there is a lot of crime out there and that there are
only so many cops does not create a defense if you happen to get
charged/caught.  Further, if you have the misfortune to commit an illegal act
in front of a cop, and she decides to take you in, it is no defense that cops
haven't charged anyone with this offense in the past 10 years and usually don't
bother.  To take a particularly graphic example of this, the plaintiff in
Bowers v. Hardwick had the misfortune to commit sodomy in front of policeman
who had been invited into the house by another resident; the door to the
plaintiff's room happened to be open, allowing the cop to witness the act.  Had
the prosecutor brought charges (the actual procedural posture was more complex
as although there was an arrest the prosecutor had shown no desire to
prosecute), it would have no defense to say that while the law had been on the
books a long time, it had been years since the last prosecution.

In short, *if* my memory serves, the type of selective enforcment you are
describing (only charging people who are flagrant or make pains of themseleves)
is legal.  We may be sad about this, but as I recall it that is the current
state of US law.

I invite readers with a fresher knowledge of the criminal law to correct (or,
if I'm lucky) endorse the above.

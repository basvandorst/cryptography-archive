You only need a little more than seven bytes of plaintext.  If you
know or can guess the format of the encrypted material, you can
probably guess this much.  Do you sign your encrypted messages?
Is there any known header information?  Does the plaintext have a
"magic number", or any likely strings?  If it's compressed, does
the compressor output low-entropy text while it gets up to speed?
All of these possibilities, and many more, give opportunities to
guess plaintext.  If it doesn't work, do another run.  After all,
even with a cheap, present-tech machine, it's 7 hours per exhaustive
search.  For a $20 million machine with T+5years technology?  Pfft.

The point is that any system using single DES is pretty weak under a
cheap current attack.  You want your cryptosystem to be strong under
an expensive future attack.  PEM is not wide open, but it would be
given a few more orders of magnitude, which will not take long given
past advances.

   I've written DES and IDEA in 486 asm.. I get 108K/sec for DES on
a 486/33, using every optimization I can think of. It's available
(with source) from ripem.msu.edu as des486.zip. I've heard bragging
from others that they get better speed with their implementations--
I'm sure better speed is possible.
   I have spent somewhat less time on IDEA, because it's so much
more straightforward-- I get 140K/sec. Source code not available,
because I never got around to cleaning it up enough to be presentable.
Sounds like your IDEA is faster....

   This is not correct. Commonly-used RSA systems use key sizes significantly 
   larger than 425 bits. Common RSA key sizes range from 512 bits to 1024. 
   Factoring RSA-129 does not in any way jeopardize the security of widely 
   used versions of RSA. 

You are both correct.  It is very common to use RSA keys in the range
512 to 1024 bits.  However, PGP (for example) provides 384-bit keys as
an option and quite a few people have taken up this option.  Get hold of
the keyring from a public key server if you wish to check this claim.

I have been telling people to use at least 512-bit keys and they really
ought to be using much larger ones.  Nonetheless, running RSA on a small
computer, in the 8086 class, can be so slow that some people trade off
security for convenience.

We can estimate that factoring 512-bit numbers is somewhere between a
hundred and a thousand times more difficult than factoring 425-bit
numbers.  This increase in difficulty is sufficiently small that one
should be concerned about the security of 512-bit keys in the near
future.

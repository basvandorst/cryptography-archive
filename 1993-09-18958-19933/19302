David, you have a strange opinion about argumentation and discussion. The fact
that NSA is bothering him because of his own intellectual property is
an interesting experience. It is very courageous of Grady to start 
discussing it here, a public forum, instead of being intimidated by NSA
and shutting up about it.
Grady is limited in his right of publishing, his freedom of speech
is severed. if that is something you consider unworthy of open discussion,
then what are you doing on The Net ? It would be just as rude on my side
to tell you that you shouldn't post, because I don't like the sentences you
produce. The only reason I can see, for you taking this strange point
of view is that you have an interest in the fact that this discussion
is not held in a public place, where it is much more difficult to intimidate
than in 'the real world'.

I also regard it a a misperception that you say that discussion on The Net
will not lead to any changes outside the Net. There have been numerous
people that found usefull information on the network, it changed people's
lives, let alone their views.

A rather tedious attempt.. You can not control the Net and the actions
of it's participants.

 The issue is precisely the fact that compression or even simple
 translation to "network ASCII" can have good statistics, and yet
 not be ciphers.  This might well be confusing to, for example, some
 Law Enforcement technicians.  Just how "trivial" is it for even the
 least informed to detect that someone is using a cipher when the
 cipher itself announces that fact to the world?

 Another option is to start out in a common mode, and then negotiate
 higher security from an essentially unbounded set of possible
 ciphers and modes.  The negotiation itself could be "piggybacked"
 on normal message transmission, thus allowing frequent changes in
 strategy.

 I don't recall saying any such thing.  Judge for yourself:

 Simple Substitution on random-like data is not weak.  Unless, of
 course, you have an attack I have not heard of . . . .

 Like most things in cryptography, Simple Substitution is a tool,
 which can be used properly or improperly.  Since such an operation
 must occur anyway to get to or from "network ASCII," we have an
 opportunity to use it properly (in the cryptographic sense), for
 only the cost of initializing the permutation.  Certainly this
 should not be prohibited.

 Good!


 Anybody have any more?


 And why didn't the PEM people have this discussion with us, here in
 sci.crypt, the home of crypto experts on Internet, before proposing
 an Internet standard which uses cryptography on the Internet?

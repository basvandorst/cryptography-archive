I don't know anything about how they work.  I do know, though, that
precise timing of the various detonators is critical, so to speak.
You need a perfectly spherical implosion to generate a nuclear explosion.
That suggests that one strategy is to encrypt the timing data; an
incorrect decryption would produce bad data, and hence a nuclear
fizzle.  To guard against someone just ripping out the PAL and installing
a simple-minded timing circuit -- and with IC's, precise timing is much
easier today than in 1945 -- I'd guess that the configuration of
explosives surrounding the plutonium core is asymmetric, at least in
effect; thus, one would need to do a great deal of engineering analysis
to reconstruct a proper timing chain.

Remember -- these are *guesses*; while I think I understand the
capabilities of cryptosystems pretty well, I know very little about
nukes, and almost nothing about engineering them.  I have no idea if
such an asymmetric implosion is even possible.  But it's the only
answer I've been able to come up with that strongly links the output
of a cryptosystem to the ability to detonate a bomb, in a way that's
difficult to bypass.

   On a dec I have to type in random characters to get 22 extra key characters
   when I do the following command:

   cat message.txt | pgp -fes "John Doe <jd@jd.com>" | mail jd@jd.com

   When I compile pgp and run it on a sun pgp does not ask for this 
   "extra" session key which I find a lot more convienent as long as I
   am not losing security.  I have my public keys and things setup 
   properly I think ... strange.

   Which is supposed to be the default?  Why?  Is it machine dependent? Why?

   Am I doing something wrong?  

It sounds like your sun can read your randseed.bin file, but
the dec cannot.  That would explain this problem.  If PGP
cannot read the randseed.bin file, then it will prompt you for
seed data to build the random IDEA key.

FYI: This probably should have been in alt.security.pgp, which is
a better newsgroup for PGP-specific questions.

   Perhaps we can prioritize the various array of configuration options
available on modern modems according to the criteria specific to digital
voice transmission.
   My modem documentation is a bit sketchy, but MNP3 looks pretty good to
me- it does not do compression, and it uses smaller block sizes than
MNP4&5.  Hence I suspect the latency would be marginally less (how much
so I don't know).  Actual throughput is probably not much of an issue-
needless to say the specification of the compression scheme is going to
lock you into a given bitrate.  As long as the average (non-error)
thoughput for the configuration employed exceeds the required bitrate,
what else matters?

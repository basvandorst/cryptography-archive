About 10 years ago Intel produced a version of their EPROM-based 8748
microcontroller called a "KeyPROM," or "KEEPROM," (I forget the
spelling they picked).

The target market was the games cartridge market. It never made a big
splash, for whatever reasons, and I'm relatively sure it's no longer
being sold.

An old Intel catalog from that period might have more details.

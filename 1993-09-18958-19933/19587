Here is the main source of your confusion.  Let us suppose (as seems more
likely than not) that you are 100% right about how State reads its own
regulation.  Let us further suppose that a competent court would agree htat
State's reading of its regulation is the correct reading in the sense that at
the time the regulation was drafted this is what it was intended to mean [that,
for the record, is the most critical test, not what State now thinks].

So what?

If the regulation violates the First Amendment it is invalid.  Indeed in the
most important sense "it always was" invalid.  An unconstitutinoal rule is a
nullity, even if we as citizens can't be 100% sure that it in fact
unconstitutional until so reassured by a competent court.  None of this
detracts from the fact that all regulations enjoy a presumption of legitimacy. 
But this presumption can be overcome.  A rule that restricts domestic speech
seems an excellent candidate for being found unconstitutional.

Leaving aside the loaded word "ideological" which just gets in the way, this is
a member of the class of cases in which arguments of the form "isn't" are
indeed legitimate.  We have a regulation which purports to do X; as applied to
situation Y it appears to produce a result within the class of things that the
goverment is forbidden from doing by the First Amendment.  If this is a correct
description of the facts, it is surely a proper legal conclusion that the
regulation is invalid at least as applied to these facts if not in all cases.
This is precisely the sort of analysis that lawyers do -- and should do.

See above.  Just because State takes a postion does not make it (1) right
and/or (2) constitutionally correct.  That said, State has an excelleent legal
department, and they are often careful.  If it gets to court, expect them to
put up a first class fight in defense of their views.

Hmmm.  Guess you only associate with the wrong kind of professors!  The argment
you are having trouble with is **so far from inconceivable** as to make the 
above text seem odd to me.  This is not to say that I expect every lawyer or
professor to agree with the claims; it *is* to say that I expect that anyone
who has ever passed the bar would 1) understand and 2) anticipate such an
argument.  It is just that basic.

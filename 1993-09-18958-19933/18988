Hmm, the person who installs the program on his system probably has
root status, so this won't be a problem. I even think it would be
easier to break copy protection on a Unix program since there are fewer
ways to obtain values from hardware (ethernet address, CPU-Id, dongle),
and good tools to trace processes are usually available.

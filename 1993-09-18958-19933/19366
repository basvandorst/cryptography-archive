Please look again at what Mr. Ward has written, Mr. Sternlight.
(It is pleasing to see that you are good enough terms to refer to him as
'Grady').

Mr. Ward points out that PGP is available throughout the world, yet you
seem to concentrate exclusively on the USA, in your reply to his statement.
It is apparent to me that Mr. Ward is referring to PGP as the WORLD's
foremost encryption application, before stating that it is not yet unlawful
to posses PGP source code in the US.
Since the packages you describe are not available outside of the USA/Canada
(as far as I am aware), then the potential user base open to these packages is 
vastly smaller than the potential user base for PGP.
I cannot absolutely contradict your statement, as it is possible that
hundreds of thousands of users may be using RIPEM in the USA, with only a few
people using PGP outside the USA.  However, as e-mail becomes more available
to the general public, it is easy to see the situation where whatever
applications are available outside the USA become the WORLD's most
foremost cryptography application, especially if user base is one of the
major criteria of this (as your post seems to imply).

It is feasable that PGP already has a larger user base worldwide than the
other packages mentioned above. Analysis of numbers of keys on servers can
give a guide to numbers of users, but excludes users of packages who
decide to keep distribution of their public keys limited to a small
number of users (in case analysis of public keys becomes easily performed?).
I would be interested to see any reliable data produced on this issue.

However it appears to me that faxing the NSA with details of what one wishes
to do is not making one's own rules, but determining the extent and legality
of the existing rules. If no challenge is forthcoming, then perhaps the NSA
considers the export legal. If a challenge is mounted, as in this case,
then there is a difference of opinion, and a court may decide ; At least a
decision is reached!.

People have been arguing over "what if" scenarios. I wouldn't want to suggest
that Mr. Ward's intent was to provoke a decision, but that may be the effect.
At least the situation moves from mere argument to a basis in a legal
judgement.

As you note, this is your Humble Opinion. A civil liberties organization
may very well take a different viewpoint. In addition, has Mr. Ward yet
been accused of any offense?.

I hope to have complied with this sentiment.

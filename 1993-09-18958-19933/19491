It's not quite over yet, though it is over for the US.

The war in Europe ended with the 1956 Austrian peace treaty and the
1991 German re-unification treaty.  The US and Japan signed a peace
treaty on the deck of the USS Missouri in 1945.  

A state of war still exists between Russia and Japan.

The mistake of 1918 was not the armistice itself but rather that there
was no formal *surrender* by the German armed forces; the armistice
was simply a cease-fire.  It's true that the Germans were in no
condition to continue the fight, but because they weren't *forced* to
acknowledge this, Hitler was later able to claim that they could have,
that the people who signed the Versailles Treaty were traitors, etc.
It was this that decided Churchill and Roosevelt to insist on
unconditional surrender in 1945.

Compare this with the "ending" of the Gulf war.  
Saddam Hussein isn't exactly acting as if he has lost.  

We're going to continue to be at war for a LONG time...

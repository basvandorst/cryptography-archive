I've done some reading on PGP, both here and in Wired, and I'd like to start
learning how to use it.  Unfortunately, I don't know where to get a copy of
the program.

I'd really appreciate it if someone would post the location of a copy or send
me a copy of their own.  Also, will this program run on a PC?  How should I
implement my public key?  

Any and all information on this subject welcome.

Thanks all,

Jeff

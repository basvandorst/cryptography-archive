ObNit:
   Computers _themselves_ canNOT understand programming languages.  The
computer requires an executable binary file to translate the programming-
language file into another executable binary file.  The fact that the
computer can use a program to do some sort of transformation on source code
to make an executable module doesn't mean the computer can understand the
source code, any more than the fact that the computer can use a program to
do a transformation on your latest novel (i.e., change it from ones and
zeroes on a magnetic medium to ink on paper) means the computer can understand
the novel.
   Even items like Rockwell's LISP engine don't really understand LISP all
by themselves, even though they give that appearance; the engine contains
a microprocessor and ROM code (that executable binary again) which is run
in order to translate the LISP code into something the processor can grok.
   It's a small, but very important, distinction.

The recent crypto related items appearing in the news have triggered a
usually dormant twenty year old interest of mine in cryptography and
I'd like to subscribe to a journal to keep up to date.  I understand
that there is a _Cryptologica_ journal available for the
mathematically minded and I'd appreciate it if someone could confirm
this and also to provide subscription information.  Perhaps a reply in
the newsgroup would be appropriate as others might also be interested.

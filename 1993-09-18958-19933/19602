If memory serves - and please recall that I don't teach First Amendment law -
there is not total agreement on this point at the margins.  Just about everyone
agrees that most free speech rights belong to everyone publisher or not; there
have been some suggestions (I forget now if it's in the academic literature or
or in court decisions) that certain rights, e.g. 'shield law' rights  that let
reporters protect sources (or the [alleged] constitutional version of these
state statutory rights) may apply only to publishers/journalists and not
laypeople.  For what it's worth, I have always thought that the 'better view'
was that even at the margins there is no special right for publsihers except
those created explicitly by statute.  

But the above example regarding GM is not at the
margin.  GM has these rights under "free speech".  The publisher/nonpublisher
distinction is not without importance in some other contexts e.g. sale of
software in that issues arise like whether the UCC applies.  But now we are way
outside my competence.

    You have to have a version of Pretty Good Privacy online and running. 
The above is the "fingerprint" of a key, obtained by typing PGP -kvc 
[userid] [keyring].  Once you have that, you can verify more easily any 
key of the person who also left a copy of the fingerprint in a separate 
message.  Of course, this still doesn't PROVE that the person in question 
isn't being emulated or some such, but it does help cut down the number 
of forged keys floating about, if any such do in fact exist.

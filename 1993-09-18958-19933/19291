Wat is known about "layered" encryption schemes? 
I uses the term layerd to describe algorithms which may be described by:

x => f(x,k) where:

y(1) = g(x,k(1))
y(2) = g(y(1),k(2))
 
 
 
y(n-1) = g(y(n-2),k(n-1))
f(x,k) = g(y(n-1),k(n))

In particular, I am interested in 3 special cases of the crypto kernal function g(x,k):

Case 1:		g(x,k) = k xor T(P(x))
Case 2:		g(x,k) = T(P(x xor k))
Case 3:		g(x,k) = T(P(x) xor k)

k = {k(n), k(n-1),.....k(1))

where T() represents any invertible mapping of its argument and P() is a permutation.
Also it is assumed that both f() and its inverse are widely known and that the key, k, is secret and vulnerable to attack.

Originally, I choose Case three for implementation because because I beleived that randomizing the arguments to T() would excite the avalanche property. However, upon
further reflection, it appears that not having a masking of the outer layer as in Case 1 allows the outer layer of the "onion" to be peeled back more easily.

1)  Does having a large number of layers aleviate this weakness?

2)  Should Case 1 be used for the outer layer in any case?

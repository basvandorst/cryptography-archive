       ^^^^^^ false ^^^^      ^^^^^true^^^^^^^^^^

When posting this message, why not also include the name of the
group?   (i.e. talk.politics.crypto alt.comp.databases.xbase.clipper 
alt.privacy.clipper, although the databases group is probably
not the one...)

Crossposting does not consume network bandwidth nor disk storage
on most sites.  It does waste the time of readers who use obsolete
newsreaders.  Crossposting and frequently changing the subject
line wastes the time of everybody.

       You need legal advice.  The ITAR is just regulations; the 
statutory authority isn't as broad as the administration sometimes
makes it out to be.  There are statutory exemptions for certain types
of published material.  And this issue can be litigated on First
Amendment grounds.

       Look for support from publisher's organizations.  PEN, ANPA,
etc.  With the publishing industry entering the electronic media market
in a big way, you might find litigation support from the industry.

       Talk to John Markoff at the New York Times.  He's published
good stories on related subjects in the past.

       NSA has a history of making veiled threats in this area, but
I though they stopped that after all the objections from the academic
community after they tried to stop publications on Galois field theory.

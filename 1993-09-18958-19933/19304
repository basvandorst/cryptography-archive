So why does AT&Ts Surety (tm) Secure  voice box (that requires an existing
telephone) cost $1200, while  their Videophone in the Phone Store costs $999?

(The videophone is complete)

I would imagine that the secret to cheap secure voice is competition, which
would motivate burdened cost reduction.

The expensive part is signal conditioning on the analog (handset) side.

The cheapest thing you could do for voice would be CVSD at 9600 baud,
low cost conversion, low cost modem, should sound better than 2400 baud
LPC.

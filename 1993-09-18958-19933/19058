I wouldn't say that is its "only" purpose.  It permits us to check
that fingerprint against the fingerprint of the key we have that
we think is yours.  If they don't match, we know something is amiss.
Either the key isn't yours or the newsgroup article isn't yours (or
there is a typo in your .sig).    That is of some use.  

I agree it is not authentication, of course.

If someone could post an article appearing to be yours, but with a
false fingerprint in the .sig, that could cause some confusion.

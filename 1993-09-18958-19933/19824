Sternlight, you literally don't know what you're talking about.

The phrase ``international arms dealer'' has no legal significance.
DTC does not have two separate registration lists, one labelled
``manufacturers of defense articles'' and the other labelled
``international arms dealers.'' There is just one registration list.
Manufacturers _and_ dealers must register, in exactly the same way, for
exactly the same fees. A manufacturer who suddenly decides to export
does not need to reregister.

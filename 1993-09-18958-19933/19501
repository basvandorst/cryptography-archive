(long comments omitted)

But he faxed the NSA the day before the subpoenas were served. It takes a
long process to decide to issue the subpoenas, and then issue them. Chances
even are that the person he faxed wasn't even in the subpoena loop. Thus his
fax is irrelevant to the issue of the subpoenas.

(Who knows, maybe there was advance notice in some form, and he faxed them
knowing the subpoenas were coming out. Or maybe not.)

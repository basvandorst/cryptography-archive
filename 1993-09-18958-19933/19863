To attack a working key, you (usually) know that the plaintext is ASCII. So
you take eight blocks of ciphertext, and for each trial key, you decrypt the 
first block and check the eight top bits are zero. If so, you then check the 
next block, and so on.

To attack a key encrypting key, you (usually) know that the keys encrypted 
under it have odd parity, so the same attack works, mutatis mutandis.

The former attack will work against many electronic mail encryption systems, 
and the latter against many banking systems.

Hope this helps,

Ross

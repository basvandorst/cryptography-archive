      With all this talk about secure voice communications, the consensus seems
   to be that building a portable secure phone that uses standard lines is
   difficult, and that it will almost certainly be a costly product, regardless
   of who builds it.  I've been considering a much lower cost substitute--a very
   cheap, portable machine to provide secure text communication across a phone
   line.  This would basically be a palmtop with a DES chip and a modem, and
   maybe connections for acoustic couplers so that it can be easily used on
   payphones.  You establish a session with someone, use a relatively slow
   internal processor to exchange session keys, and then run text encryption and
   "talk" by typing.  I wonder if there'd be a market for this sort of thing....

Well, if you make it TDD-compatible, and include the features that the
higher-end TDDs use, you've got some chance at reaching a market where
voice isn't really that important.  On the other hand, the early-adopters 
in the deaf market are also doing ASCII-oriented communications, email,
etc., and may have PGP and RIPEM by now if they want it.

A sufficiently flexible palm-top-based system could be interesting,
and another emerging market is communications for the Apple Newton /
Casio Zoomer / EO market, where people need to go beyond traditional
ASCII anyway to do convenient graphics communications; some of those
systems have a reasonable amount of horsepower (hence the RSA step may
not be painfully slow.)  In particular, for cellular communications,
security is sufficiently important to businesses that people may be
willing to spend Real Cash to get it, and one-watt Clipper chips mostly
get laughed at.

For both of these approaches, you've got to do something about the
public-key side of the problem - Diffie-Hellman is simpler,
since you can use it without prearrangement, and supplement it with
RSA for man-in-the-middle interloper prevention, but RSA is usable too.
The catch is of course that PKP will want some money :-),
unless you're doing a Free Hardware Design approach and RSAREF,
but a reasonable-sized market should be able to support that.

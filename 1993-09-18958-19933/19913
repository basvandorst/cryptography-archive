Regardless of the method by which you are being cryptanalyzed, changing
your key often is a sound procedure. It limits the amount of data that can
be lost, without requiring the enemy to initiate another attack.

The most common error though when changing keys often is using some sort of
pattern to generate the key. This is a major error, and will allow your
enemy to decrypt your data in real-time.

I can't believe you are saying this. Here is my encrypted UNIX password,
'oKg9fE5yvxpMs', go ahead and crack it. BTW, I just changed it, so when
your brute force machine finds it, just what do you think you can do with
it? Now suppose I tell you what my new encrypted password is, and promise
not to change it until there is evidence it has been guessed? I imagine you
will be reading my mail, etc.

By then, the horses have already left the barn.

Business Week, Oct. 4, 93, p 43, has an article on this topic. Here are
some extractions.

- Phillip Zimmerman wanted to strike a blow for freedom...wrote [PGP] and
offered it free... over the Internet.

- But NSA is trying to restrict high-quality encryption.

- on Sept 9 two software companies in TX and AZ have received grand-jury
subpoenas...about [PGP].

- Government won't discuss the investigation. But Z's lawyer says the
probe "is amed at how it [widespread distribution of PGP] occurrred and
whether an offense was committed."

- "Clinton is very cautious about dabbling in national security. This is an
area that has essentially been turned over to the spooks," says an
export-controls specialist, an attorney.

- Congress is concerned about loss of business due to export controls.
...encryption is available from foreign sources "yet the US continues to
control this software as a Munitions List item."

- The goal of NSA of keeping messages secure...is laudable "law enforcers
no longer have the inside track. Technology has overtaken them.

- But they want to maintain as much control as possible for as long as
possible. "If they lift export controls, they [NSA, etc] might as well go
home."

- Rep Sam Gejdenson (D-Conn) hopes to introduce legislation early next
year to revamp gove polich on high-tech exports. The result will probably
be looser restrictions of encryption software.

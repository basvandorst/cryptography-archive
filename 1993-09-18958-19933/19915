This is not hair-splitting but an attempt to put paid to a propaganda
distortion and misstatement of the facts which contain implied bad advice to
those under subpoena.

There are plenty of people who are registered as manufacturers of defense
articles who do no exporting. They (and perhaps the courts) would be very
surprised at the interpretation that they are being treated "as if" they
were International Arms Dealers.

The contention is actually both offensive to some and a misrepresentation.

But I notice that some here are in the habit, when being caught out, to
attempt to defend their errors with the rubric "Oh, that's only splitting
hairs."

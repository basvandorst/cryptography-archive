Denning's CRYPTOGRAPHY AND DATA SECURITY is a good book, but it is very
dated.  Patterson's MATHEMATICAL CRYPTOGRAPHY is bad; it leavs a lot of
things out, is misleading in places in wrong in others, and he changes
his notation midway through the book.  If you can wait until November,
my book--APPLIED CRYPTOGRAPHY--will be published by John Wiley & Sons.
I think it's pretty good.

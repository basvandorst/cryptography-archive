The difference is that Austin Code Works is not according to Grady Ward a 
manufacturer of crypto equipment or anything else (except publications).  
Austin Code Works is a _publisher_.

But the regulatory climate for the publishing business is that there are--
and can be--no regulations and certainly no registration requirements or 
licensing.  This absence of regulation, registration, and licensing is 
mandated by the provisions of the first amendment to the federal 
constitution preserving the freedoms of speech and of the press.

That is why this the letter from the Office of Defense Trade Controls 
is shocking.

I am afraid that anyone who equates the publication of publically available 
information that is useful in the preservation of one's privacy to the 
opening of the liquor store would not see anything perverse in requiring 
publishers to register as international arms traffickers.

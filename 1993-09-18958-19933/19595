Seems to me that, unless the gov can prove Grady knowingly hired an
exporter who intended to **illegally** export his product, there is no
case here.  It is up to the exporter to apply for a license, if necessary.
Grady might have to check this exporter's name against a list of known
illegal reshippers, and might have to get certification from the exporter
that the product will not go anywhere illegally.  Merely soliciting for
an exporter is a completely innocent act.  

I don't think export of the product is illegal.  Export of the product
without a license IS illegal, though.

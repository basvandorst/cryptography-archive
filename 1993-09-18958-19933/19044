Three words:

	Proprietary File Formats.

And proprietary languages (Lotus' macros for one). Using a package like
that that restricts you to a single CPU, or worse expires, puts *your*
data at the whim of companies that have shown little reluctance to abandon
users at the slightest pretext.

I'd go for this sort of shenanigans *if* there were a requirement that any
protected software have its source code placed in escrow, to be released
to registered users in the event that the company no longer supplies or
sells a compatible (software, hardware, file formats) version.

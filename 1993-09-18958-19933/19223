I'm been lurking here for a year and this is my first message.

I *BELEIVE* this is a way to safely confirm a secret key over an
insecure channel.

Create a *random* bit string the length of the key

XOR it with the key

Send THAT over the channel

The other guy XORs it with the key (Which shoiuld be the same as YOUR
key) and sends it back

You check and if it's the RANDOM STRING - he's in!

The eavesdropper is left with a random string...

This seems to work to me, and is so easy that I figure it's either been
done before or has some obscure flaw.

Answers, anyone?

The reason why it is confusing is that their are copyright, patent, and
ITAR (state department 'international trafficking in arms regs') that vary
by national jurisdiction.

The best introduction to these issues and PGP is in the extensive PGP
documentation itself.  Or you can subscribe to alt.security.pgp and ask
around there.  Get PGP from:

soda.berkeley.edu
nic.funet.fi
ota.ox.ac.uk
ghost.dsi.unimi.it

And upload to your local BBS and give copies 
on disk to your friends. 

I've gotten two opinions attorneys specializing in hi-tech patents
that possessing and distributing the complete source to PGP is
perfectly legal in the United States, as long as there exists no intent
to provoke others to infringe on RSA patents.  As we have recently seen
the NSA and Customs may have a different opinion to such publishing.

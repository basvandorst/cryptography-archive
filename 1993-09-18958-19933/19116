Same way you implement any other escrow. Deposit the code with a bonded
organization, and pay such fees as are required for the service. To get the
software out of escrow you submit an application form and supporting documents
(license, registration, bankruptcy papers, etc) and pay another fee.

More or less, yes.

Same way you secure anything else of this nature. You lock it up in a secure
location operated by a trusted entity.

I am searching for two out-of-print books. I would like to purchase one
copy each in reasonably good condition. If you have either and are willing
to part with it, please contact me by email. Thanks.

Tutorial: The Security of Data in Networks
by Davies
IEEE Computer Society Press, 1981

Kahn on Codes
by Kahn
Macmillan, 1983

Note: the second book is NOT "The Codebreakers" but a later book by Kahn.

"The Data Encryption Standard (DES) and its Strength Against Attacks,"  Don
Coppersmith, RC 18613 (81421) 12/22/92, IBM Research Division, TJ Watson
Research Center, Yorktown Heights, NY.

Fascinating paper, although there's nothing really new in it at this point.
Rumor is that it may appear in the IBM Technical Journal sometimes this year.

	Well, actually, explosions do not require fire (they don't even require
heat in the case of explosions arising from gas evolution), the reactions need
not necessarily be fast (explosions themselves are fast, but a strong 
container can make up for a slow reaction, somewhat), and the explosive
need not be small (as our nuclear discussions point out).

	So hold your applause :-)

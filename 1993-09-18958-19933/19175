Time used, not time logged in.  Easy enough to implement the distinction.

Hmm.  'No matter how much you use the electricity,  the electrical utility   
still has to put the same amount of effort into producing the power plant in  
the first place'.  Charging as a service has _so many_ advantages over lump sum  
charging that it would seem to be inevitable for expensive packages.  Public  
key crypt will make charging as a service possible.

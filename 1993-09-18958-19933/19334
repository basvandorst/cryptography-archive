Summary: The postscript version is a bit difficult to read with vi

Earlier today I got a copy of des_key_search.ps from the EFF
ftp server.  Unfortunately, postscript files are a bit 
difficult to read using a Unix editor like vi.  Does anyone
have a straight text version?  If so, your email would be
greatly appreciated.  Any public domain / freeware utility
to convert the file on an old PC clone ('286x10 20MG) running
MS-DOS 3.1 would help.  Thanks.

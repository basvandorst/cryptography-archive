I once wrote a multi-pass multi-pattern disk overwrite routine for a
Mil-Spec disk system (for which I was doing the controller ucode).  I
was getting seriously frustrated trying to get the thing to meet the
elapsed-time spec when I heard that these disks were going to be rack-mounted
next to a thermite destruct device.  Oh well, <plonk> (sound of code
hitting /dev/null).

About six months ago I needed beta testers for the book.  I asked on the
net and got far more than I needed.  (Thanks to all those who took the
time to read and comment on all or part of the book--you know who you are.)
I think the book is suitable for a crypto novice.  I wrote the book for
programmers, not for mathematicians.

It's large, comprehensive, and fairly complete (although new discoveries
and techniques happen all the time).

It should also be pointed out that there are ciphers that survived
differential cryptanalysis.  Khufu, the sister algorithm to Khafre and
also designed by Ralph Merkle, is completely resistant to differential
cryptanalysis.  The S-boxes are key dependent, making it impossible to
use a differential attack.  (I recommend this approach to people trying
to designa block cipher; it also has properties that make it resistant
to linera cryptanalysis.)  REDOC-II only really fell to differential
cryptanalysis in its one round version; 2- 3- and 4-round REDOC-II can
only be partially cryptanalyzed by differential cryptanalysis.  The
inventors of IDEA showed that their algorithm is resistant to differential
cryptanalysis after five of its eight rounds.

The version of LOKI that fell to differential cryptanalysis is LOKI89.
The new version of the algorithm, LOKI91, can be attacked by a variant of
differential cryptanalysis called "related-key cryptanalysis."  Another
algorithm, called NewDES (absolutely no relation to DES, despite the name)
can also be attacked through related-key cryptanalysis.

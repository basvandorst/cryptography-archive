Why not? The 'stupid' XOR would make the brute force atack much more
complicated.

Let's take an extreme example. In a block cyphered DES we create a block
of random data size equal the plaintext. We 'encrypt' the text by XORing
it with the random data. Then we append the random data to the XORed
plaintext.

An sich, the XOR encryption is stupid. But it will force the brute force
atack to completely decrypt the (XORed) plaintext before he can verify
a password.

Say what? CELP and LPC-10 are vocoder algorithms, not ciphers. NSA
could sabotage the ciphers it releases, but I don't see how even they
could sabotage the security of a vocoder algorithm as long as I can
use it with a strong cipher that I trust.

NSA is like the "Force" from Star Wars -- it has a dark side and a
good side. I have no objection to NSA's good side developing strong
crypto for internal government use. Nor would I refuse to use a good
piece of technology just because they developed it (assuming I could
trust it, of course, which is certainly not the case for Clipper).

I *do* object to NSA dark side's futile attempts to make strong crypto
a US government monopoly.

Perhaps you forgot a smiley?

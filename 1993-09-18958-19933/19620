If an independent entity (even one *owned* by GM) does the actual
printing of GM manuals, then the entity does indeed fall under the
"special" category publisher... i.e. it should gain all the
presumptive protections of the First Amendment.  I don't know the
particular situation with GM, nor with Austin Code Works.  But DS's
own assertion was that ACW was in the business of doing stuff like
publishing manuals for software, and such like.  As well, Grady Ward
has mentioned a couple times that ACW doesn't produce actual
executables.  Assuming this is true, then *of course* ACW has all the
presumptive special protections of the First Amendment.  Just because
the content of their speech happens to be of a sort of specific
interest to owners of software executables, their speech isn't thereby
any less protected.

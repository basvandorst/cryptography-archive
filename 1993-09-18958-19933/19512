Grady FWIW:

YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT:
There is nothing you can say on the net that will help you without the
risk if it also hurting you.

YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO AN ATTORNEY:
Let him/her talk for you.  You can always deny/fire/redirect them or
their statements.

ANYTHING YOU SAY CAN AND WILL BE USED AGAINST YOU IN A COURT OF LAW:
And possibly other places.  A lunch says you'll see some of your net
traffic again...

Many have learned this the hard way.

Best wishes.

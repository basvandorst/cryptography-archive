    Does _anyone_ (including the government) think that "restricting" the
   export of crypto stuff will actually keep foreign spies from getting it ?!?

No.

They are not interested in foreign spies. (Actually, they are, but for
quite different reasons.)

What they are worried about is *everyone* getting and using it.  If
multi-terabytes of data is protected with strong encryption, where in
hell do you look for that minute fraction which is interesting.

If only the interesting stuff is encrypted, at least it stands out as
being interesting, even if you can't read it easily.

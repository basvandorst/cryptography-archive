First, this comment-in-the-form-of-a-question is dishonest, in the same
sense that "When did you stop beating your wife?" is dishonest. It assumes a
fact not in evidence.

Second, some are in conversation with RSA about a "legal" PGP in the U.S. 
If they reach agreement (dunno why things are suddenly quiet on this--maybe
because Justice is investigating PGP and RSA doesn't want to get into it
until the grand jury has reached its conclusion), then one might expect PGP
to be discussed in that context. Until then, as the patent holder any
discussion by RSA would be highly controversial to some, and I assume the
FAQ is trying to avoid that.

Third, you'd hardly expect them to give publicity to something they feel is,
at least in the U.S., an infringement of their patent, and a FAQ is no place
to argue the legal issues.

I had previously posted the below to alt.security and received
the suggestion that it might better be addressed here. Any help
would be appreciated. Thanks. - JMY

I am looking for references regarding zero-knowledge proofs
(I think that is what they are called; see below for a
description of what I'm talking about)

As I understand them they work something like this:
Given two communicators trying to authenticate each other over
a non-secure communications channel, they provide each other
information about the password that doesn't reveal or help
to reveal the password. They do this several times (perhaps many)
and after each interchange the confidence level that each has
in the other's knowledge of the password increases. As the
number of iterations -> infinity, the probability that the other
guy has the right password -> 1. Any eavesdropper still has no
(useful?) information about the password itself and can't use it
to authenticate him/her-self. The type of information passed by
the communicators might be things like prime factors of the
password.

Any pointers to references would be appreciated. - JMY"

   Third, you'd hardly expect them to give publicity to something they feel is,
   at least in the U.S., an infringement of their patent, and a FAQ is no place
   to argue the legal issues.

Here is an excerpt from the FAQ:

    In North America, a license is needed to ``make, use or sell''
    RSA. However, PKP usually allows free non-commercial use of RSA,
    with written permission, for personal, academic or intellectual
    reasons. Furthermore, RSA Laboratories has made available (in the
    U.S. and Canada) at no charge a collection of cryptographic
    routines in source code, including the RSA algorithm; it can be
    used, improved and redistributed non-commercially (see Question
    \ref{q:zm}).

In the previous version of the FAQ, written permission was not
mentioned.  If they give us permission to use it, it's not violating
their patent.

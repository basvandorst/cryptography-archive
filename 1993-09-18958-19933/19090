Uranium bombs usually have a lithium-polonium 'neutron accelerator', because 
uranium doesn't spontaneously fission fast enough to produce a blast effect.  
Well, not a very big one.

Plutonium bombs are driven by spontaneous fission of the higher isotopes of 
plutonium, particularly Pu-242, which is present in minuscule amounts even is 
a very pure device like at the Trinity test.  That's why you can't make a
slug-type plutonium bomb.


Re explosives, some kid in Glocester, Mass blew off six fingers while packing 
match heads into a pipe to make a bomb.  Apparently, he was using a hammer and 
stick to pack them in.  What's in a match head, anyway, and does this mean that
if I hit a pack of matches with a hammer it'll blow?  And in this case, is it
detonation or deflagration?

Not to argue for the "other side", but the distinction between "source
code" and "executable" is really one of semantics.  If I have a C
interpretter, then your "source code" could also be considered
an "executable".  With a compiler, it's an easy matter to turn the
source code into an executable.  On the other hand, the distinction between
printed and magnetic media is getting less and less distinguishable
too.  With cheap scanners and OCR technology, source code printed
on paper is really not *that* different from source code on
magnetic media which is only marginally different from executable
code.

One of a few things are going to come from this:  the feds, in their
ever-strong desire to not allow executables to be exported will start
trying to restrict source code in all forms:  on paper or on magnetic
media.   I can't see this approach succeeding in the courts.
The only other way to have a sensible law would be to allow
executables and any other form of "algorithm description" to be
freely exported, which is a step I can't see the spooks willing to
make.  Of course, we could also just have a set of arbitrary and
senseless laws....   nahhhh...  could never happen.  :-)

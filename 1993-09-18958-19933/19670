Hi,

I am interested in the data streams that are broadcast on the subcarriers of FM
radio stations.  It appears that many of these are encrypted in some form.

Can anyone give me any information about the methods used to encrypt these data
streams?  Is anybody out there interested in this hobby as well?

thanks

 And I have been arguing that the mapping to ASCII can, and perhaps
 should, be part of the cipher.  For some strange reason you seem
 to be fixated on the idea that ciphertext is "naturally" a 256-
 symbol alphabet.  It is not.  The 64-symbol alphabet is just as
 "natural," in which case the cipher need not have any additional
 mapping to transportable network ASCII.

 I'm sorry but must continually refuse to wander into your chosen
 area of debate; the issue here is: "the PEM RFC's with respect to
 crypto, could we and should we do better?"

 Oh, NOW you've got it.

 I surely have been doing so; perhaps you haven't been listening.

 I will "come back" with the comments which started this, that the
 mapping to 64-symbol network ASCII, which is required in the PEM
 RFC's is a cryptographically useless waste.

 It is perfectly reasonable to design a cipher which does its own
 mapping which is not cryptographically useless.  This means that
 such a cipher may well be as secure as, and faster than, the
 combination of a similar 256-symbol cipher and the useless
 standardized network mapping.


 One More Time:
    The PEM RFC's seem to require binary ciphertext and a
 cryptographically useless mapping; a better alternative would be
 to require simply a particular network character set and leave the
 crypto design decisions to the crypto designers.

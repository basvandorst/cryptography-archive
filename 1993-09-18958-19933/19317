The above is a sad commentary on what is supposed to be a free country.  And
it is exactly what the NSA and bureacracies want - people to roll over and
give them whatever way they want.

Now, I know that even the wealthy haven't the resources to buck Big Brother
on the present terms.   So perhaps it is time some laws were changed, to
force the 3 letter agencies to work FOR the people, instead of against them.

Maybe it is time for those with ANY influence on congresscritters to
start pushing for some major changes in the laws.  And include some
teeth to prevent government abuses.  Now, this will be a humungous uphill
battle with the current Administration, which has the feeling the STATE
is your master, and always knows best, and will 'deal with' anybody who
does not fall into lock-step (witness Waco, Randy Weaver, Lawmaster,
etc).  Only difference is that the NSA, etc isn't quite as brutish as
the BATF.  We may by this time next year have 100,000 men of the New
Peoples' National State Police to handle any 'dirty work' that needs
handling.

Ideas, anyone?  Or is it just 'give up our few remaining rights time and
get our SSN's tatooed on our forheads'?

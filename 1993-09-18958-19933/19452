	Email to the president is handled the same way as paper
mail: volunteers read it and tabulate it based on issues that
the mail appears to be addressing. With the thousands of letters
the administration gets daily (letters = fax + paper + email)
they're careful not to establish one medium as "preferred" over
the others. Since it's handled like paper, if you expect a
direct reply, include a US mail address.

	It does not go to /dev/null, nor does paper mail go to
/dev/landfill.

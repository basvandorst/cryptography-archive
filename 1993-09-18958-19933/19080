Unless you're a suicidally loyal terrorist, who is convinced that
you can ride the fireball straight to your ultimate reward.  These
are the folks we have to worry about.

I don't know about this...a Ryder van driven by a fanatic with a
road map makes a less detectable and therefore more surprising 
delivery system.  And as long as the driver doesn't come back to
reclaim his deposit on the truck, it works like a champ. :-)

Bear in mind that while only the most megalomaniac of leaders would
incite the immediate wrath of the existing superpowers by obtaining
complete ICBM's, there are an awful lot of countries that would happily
pay $20 million or whatever for a "plug-n-play" nuclear device they could
possess (and smuggle elsewhere) with little risk of detection.  I'd say
the parting-out question is at least as serious a risk as the sale or use
of the complete missiles.

Maybe not, but it *will* fit inside, say, a 20' shipping container,
billed as "machine parts" or whatever and shipped through eight
or nine countries to mask its true origin.  Just ship it to your
confederate's dummy company in, say, New York or LA, and let him
have the honor of opening the door and pushing the button.  Customs
rarely opens containerized shipments for inspection as they arrive,
unless they have received some advance warning about the shipment.
So your bomb will be a complete surprise for its victims...no radar
warnings of incoming missiles, no sirens, no evacuations, just the
big bang.  Think about that one for a while...

ObBookReview: A very good treatment of the scenario I've laid out is
_The_Fifth_Horseman_ by Larry Collins and Dominique LaPierre.  It's a 
very well-researched and well-written thriller about a frantic search 
for a Libyan H-bomb hidden in Manhattan.  There's not much detail about
what's inside the bomb casing, but a fair bit of information about the
federal NEST (Nuclear Emergency Search Teams) and their equipment and 
tactics (info which jibes nicely with the NBC News "exclusive inside look"
at NEST aired just a few weeks ago, by the way.)

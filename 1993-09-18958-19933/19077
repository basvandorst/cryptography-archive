      Here's a research topic worth considering.

      There would be applications for a means of digitally signing an
analog signal, specifically an image.  For specificity, consider signing
an image of a sheet of paper, and appending to the page a digital signature.
The result would be a sheet of paper secured against tampering, one which
anyone knowing the (presumably well-known) public key of the signer
could validate.

      One can convert the image to a digital form, but the conversion
is not fully repeatable; there will be both quantization and alignment error.
What's needed is a digital signature system which can operate on a
representation of an image, and will allow a strictly limited amount
of error in the image, enough to handle the errors inherent in scanning.

      This would be a way to create paper documents much more resistant
to forgery.   Should be a market for that.

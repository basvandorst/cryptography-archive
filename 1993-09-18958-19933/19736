I didn't say his ones and zeroes were "machine language". I said they
were machine instructions. The machine of which I spoke consists of
a slew of networked computers (the Internet--perhaps you've heard of
it), which, with their hardware and software, conveyed his message to
one final computer sitting in front of me, where further hardware and
software interpreted his ones and zeroes as illuminated phosphors for me
to read in the form of a natural language.

From the moment he sent his message on its way to the time I finally read
it, it was entirely machine instructions.

Now, who made the mistake?

Computer code is speech if someone is able to comprehend that code as the
expression of an idea. The computer doesn't comprehend the idea, but I
certainly can. 

"Machine instructions" is not necessarily a category separate from "speech."

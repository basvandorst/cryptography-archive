Differential cryptanalyis is a cryptanalytic technique introduced into the 
open literature by Eli Biham and Adi Shamir in 1990.  It is designed to
produce information about a cipher by examining the differences in
ciphertext caused by differences in plaintext.  For example, in the 
Crypto '91 proceedings, B&S show that the key to a 16-Round DES-like 
cipher called Khafre can be deduced from comparing the ciphertexts
of 1536 specially chosen plaintexts.  Since chosen plaintext attacks
are difficult to pull off (ever try asking an enemy "Say, mind if I
use your cipher machine for a few minutes?") the attack can be extended
to known plaintexts, too.  In the Khafre example above it takes about
2^37.5 known plaintexts to deduce the key.

I've head it mentioned (in sci.crypt, I think) that DES is highly
resistant to differential cryptanalysis, because of the design of the S-Boxes.
Since DES was introduced in ... I forget .. late 70's?  and the NSA advised
IBM on its design, we can guess that NSA know about DiffCrypt 10 years
before it became commonly known.

In my previous post I concluded by saying that this didn't seem to be an
egregious case of flouting the law. In the case of Austin Code Works I
assume that's true, but in Grady's case that possibility is why some of us
here were made very uncomfortable by his message asking for a foreign
distributor. That COULD get HIM in trouble, as was pointed out earlier. Hope
not, since I'm very willing to dismiss things like his posting as an
indiscretion of youth.

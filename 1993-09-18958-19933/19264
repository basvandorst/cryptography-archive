   Well, IBM makes PIN entry keypads -- the DES chip and the keypad are
embedded in the same chunk of epoxy -- no cleartext gets out of that
chunk of plastic. I believe said chunk has "booby traps" so that if
you try to cut it open, the unit becomes non functional, and all DES
keys stored on it or downloaded to it become permenantly erased. I'm
not an expert on these things, but I've talked (several years ago) to
one of the designers -- and they took the security part of it *very*
seriously.

   Of course, a thief could make up a device that looked and feeled like
real thing and grab the PINs, but he wouldn't have the right DES keys to
be able to complete the transaction -- and if he did, why bother with the
phony PIN keypad?

Regards,
Ian.

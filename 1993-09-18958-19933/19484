What has case law held in the cases of encrypted PAPER documents?  [My
understanding is that many bookmakers and thieves keep encoded records
even on paper; I'm sure SOME of them must have been good at it].  Does
the court have the right to compel someone to reveal the MEANING of
their paper records?  This would seem a key issue in this case.

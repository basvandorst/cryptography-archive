This may seem like hair-splitting, and maybe it is, but to lawyers it is an
important hair: technically the above is not correct.  If a court finds that a
regulation or statute is unconstitutional, then it "always was"
unconstitutional.  The court decision is what allows us to say it was
unconstitutional with confidence.  Why does this distinction matter? Because if
it were the case that regulations only "become" unconstitutional when so
declared by a competent court, then the government would have every right and
duty to impose punishment on those who violated the reg/statute before the
court decision.  It is the "fact" that the reg/statute was "always"
unconstitutional that protects those brave enough to act in a manner to bring
those court challenges which are ultimately successful.  Hence the regs can be
unconstitutional right now, even if NO ONE says so.  Of course, saying they are
unconstitutional does not make it so, or less so.

Note that the above statement mixes a deep and important truth with an
(understandable) misunderstanding of the consequences of that truth.  It is
correct that all regulations enjoy a presumption of correctness (and as a
pragmatic matter, also true that state/defence/CIA/NSA tend to have very good
lawyers who know what they are doing, unlike (say) the VA).  It does not follow
from this that a regulation written by any agency could not be prima facie
unconstitutional.

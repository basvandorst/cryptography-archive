   I'd avoid using xlat if I were you -- it's much slower than just doing
an indexed indirect load. XLAT takes 4 cycles -- the indexed indirect
load takes 1. XLAT is almost the equivalent of AND EAX, 0FFH;
MOV AL, [EBX+EAX]. If you don't use the high 3 bytes of EAX, you can
AND them off outside the loop. If you still need them, you can
copy AL into another register, and then use it as the index.
You can at least get twice as fast as XLAT, and possibly 4 times.

   Never mind the fact that XLAT is not a pairable instruction on the
Pentium.

Regards,
Ian.

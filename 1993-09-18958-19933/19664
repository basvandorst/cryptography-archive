I don't know the history of the Copyright Act, but its most recent edition,
dating back about a decade, certainly provides for criminal sanctions. However,
a criminal action, as always, can only be brought by the government, not by an injured party. As a practical matter, notwithstanding the FBI warnings
that come on prerecorded videotapes, criminal enforcement involves trademarks
almost exclusively. In practice, the targets are almost always imported 
clothing or other items bearing famous but unlicensed nasmes--Calvin Klein,
Levi, etc.

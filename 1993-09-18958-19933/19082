This is true. Even if the data sent to the modem were not encrypted,
V.42bis/MNP compression within the modem would be useless because it's
designed for data, not voice. All of the compression will have to be
done on the original plaintext audio samples with algorithms designed
specifically for audio. And achieving an acceptable compression ratio
pretty much requires lossy compression, i.e., adaptive delta
modulation or preferably a vocoder.

To minimize delay, it will probably also be necessary to talk to the
modem synchronously, bypassing all its error control and compression
features.  If you don't, then you have the no-win choice of disabling
LAPM and wasting channel bandwidth on start-stop bits, or leaving LAPM
on, which eliminates start-stop bits but can add substantial
store-and-forward delay, even without retransmission delays due to
channel errors. Unfortunately, synchronous interfaces are not
widespread on PCs.

I dont know what kind of computer you have, but you might want to check
out a program for the Amiga called TWC (Two Way Chat 'n Send), which
support voice compression-->encryption-->send over the high speed modem
to another computer (Amiga).  It mulitasks flawlessly.. and is not
very CPU intensive...

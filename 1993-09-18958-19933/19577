:    Can you be a bit more specific?  Say, an example?  Given the key, the
: algorithm and the cryptext, it's hard for me to imagine such an item.

It wouldn't be that hard to construct such an algorithm, for example
you could decide on which S-boxes to use in a DES like cypher based on
the input to that round - decyphering that could be fun (given enough
rounds) :-). Another example could be that you could use the
plaintext as the seed for a pseudo random number generator that you
use in encyphering :-)

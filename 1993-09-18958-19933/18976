More the to the point, you can already provide hardware copy protection
with a dongle. That way it isn't restricted to a single CPU or even a 
single location--the restriction is temporal. In those niche parts of
the market in which there is an economic benefit to hard copy protection,
dongles are already used. 

The only support a computer manufacturer might want to give for this
would be an on-board standard for dongles (maybe some sort of external 
daisy chain ZIF socket) 
that wouldn't have them hanging off an existing I/O port. But the incentive
is not even there for this level of accomodation, thus far.

There are still other types of copy protection that encryption can
provide. For example, sales software that prints out the user's name
on every page of output can have that name encrypted. Yes, there
are output filters that could beat this, but few salesmen have the
computer knowledge to even think of this, much less do it.

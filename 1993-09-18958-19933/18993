Actually, ISDN2 is 64 kbps.  I understand that this is the case even
in the US; telecoms companies who were only able to provide 56 kbps
are, I believe, upgrading their equipment so that their ISDN customers
can talk to ISDN customers in every other country in the world. :-)
Certainly our ISDN2 line is 64 kbps per D channel.

Which, of course, is the problem.  It certainly won't compress after
being encrypted, so the modem's V.42bis won't help.

Base ISDN2 gives you 64 kbps *before* compression.  Modems don't give
you anything like that -- and never will, for obvious reasons.

Our videophone has the same feature, I'm told, probably for the same
reasons.

Mind you, transatlantic phone calls often have a half-second delay,
and people still make 'em.

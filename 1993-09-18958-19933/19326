It won't actually make much difference what people post, since any 
well-designed encryption program will use a different initialization vector 
(IV) each time it's run.  The result will be that each encrypted block of 
data will be completely different each time, so you may as well take a few 
blocks of white noise and use those as a representative sample.  The only 
difference will be the headers which PGP and Ripem put at the start, but I 
assume you're only interested in the encrypted data itself not the wrapper 
around it.

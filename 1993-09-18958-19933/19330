It was I who posted.  I beleive you are reffering to TWC 3.22.

It might be possible, but dont expect it to happen on Windows....

Well, first of all the product is for the Amiga computer.  It is actually
a shareware program that I use often.  Depending on the options you have
selected, it will First digitize the incoming voice (through a sound digi
tizer), then compress it, encrypt it, and send it to the other computer
via modem or null modem.

I dont yet know if an IBM version is possible at the moment, because the
software relies HEAVILY on certain custom VLSI chips in the Amiga.

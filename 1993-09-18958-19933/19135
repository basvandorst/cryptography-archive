   Thanks for your replies to my post.  Some of you have made me
   out to be a villain trying to foist this on the computer world.
   I have no interest in implementing this, my research is in a totally
   different area.  I just wanted to resolve something that had been
   bugging me for a while.  It will be some time before I stick my
   head up again.  I apologise for being out of touch with the real world.

That's ok - we haven't had anyone suggesting copy protection in a while,
so you were a good target for underutilized flames :-)

A number of products on Suns or other workstations are using various
copy-protection substitutes such as floating license managers.
Some of them use the machine hostid as validation, some use IP address,
some do the validation only on the license server machine and not the client,
some do the validation by squawking the software product's serial
number on the net and and getting hostile if multiple copies are running.
The most annoying to me have probably been the IP-address-based systems;
they're a real pain if you want to move a machine from one network to another.

(The worst IP-address abuser is a waveform analysis package, and sometimes we want
it on our Lab's demo system, sometimes we want it at a customer site, etc.,
and we've dealt with it by leaving the address constant and merely
using bogus IP network configurations when we move it to a customer site,
which means unplugging it if we want to demonstrate nifty network
bridging hardware...  Ugly!)

The real limitation has generally been how flexible the companies are
about trading in old license numbers for new.  Some are real nice,
and will do it by phone call; others want big bucks for a new license,
and some in between are friendly but slow.

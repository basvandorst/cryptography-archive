I wonder about that every time I see the phrase.

The encrypt/decrypt/encrypt system, called the Tuchman scheme
after its inventer, is believed to be less secure than using
three independent keys (see Merkle and Hellman, On the Security
of Multiple Encrytion, CACM, v24 #7 1981).  

Its only advantage seems to be that if you have a hardware 
circuit that uses it, you can load the same key twice and be 
compatable with single DES systems.

In a software system, the single-DES compatability is not
needed, since it's easy to provide a single-encryption option 
and no one is going to want to run at less than half the 
possible speed.

So if using software DES, why not go with three keys ?

I don't know why - and haven't seen such kind of analysis in any of
the books/papers I have read on the subject. I guess, the guys who
have designed the S-boxes should have an idea of what makes the cypher
strong, but AFAIK, this knowledge is classified.

The precess is rather essential - suppose that you have just received
an encrypted message from somebody you have never communicated with.
There is no prior communication, so s/he couldn't have sent you the
phrase by some "misterious process".

The only solution is to have it present -in- the message. Another
person sent me private e-mail about how this can be done. Here it is
how.

The randomly selected b-to-a encoding table is encrypted with the
public key of the recepient. The encrypted result is encoded using
some standard b-to-a table. Even if somebody intercepts the message,
they have no way to find out what is the real encoding table used for
the rest of the message.

This is exactly the inconvenience - they have to negotiate first. A
useful public-key cryptosystem must be usable even if you get an
e-mail message, encrypted from the first time, with no prior
negotiations.

Several people have commented that anyone putting software protection
on the CPU would be laughed out of the marketplace.  I note that dongle
manufacturers are still in business.  They must be getting their
customers from somewhere.

Sun, HP, IBM, and everyone else I know of that makes non-Intel based
workstations all have a PROM on their motherboards that contains the
CPU serial number (and usually the Ethernet address) for that specific
motherboard.  The PROM can easily be interogated directly by a program
(memory mapped I/O) and is the basis of Unix-based copy protections
schemes.  The PROM can also easily be moved to a new motherboard in the
event of system repair/replacement.  (Sun, at least, semi-blew it by
putting the CPU type on the PROM as well, meaning you have to change
the affected numbers if you upgrade to a more powerful processor.) The
current trend in Unix is to net-based licensing, but the majority of
the license servers are themselves node-locked.

I for one wouldn't mind if the PROM were to be replaced with a
slightly smarter chip able to do public-key en/de-cryption via
memory-mapped I/O.  Those software manufacturers who felt that they
had to have that level of protection could use it, just like they
currently use dongles.  Those who don't wouldn't have to.  A standard
chip that isn't CPU architecture specify and so could avoid the Sun
mistake would be nice.

Im don't think that all the detonators do not go at the same time although there 
may be several tiers or groups of explosives that detonate simultaneusly. There 
are also other events that must take place before the bomb can detonate. For one,
the critical mass formed by the implosion must be iradiated by a high flux of 
neutrons at just the right time as well.

Help a poor frustrated soul!  

Ok.. tell me if I have done anything wrong.  I used pgp -kg which generated a 
secret and public key rings.  

question:  the username i inputted to generate the keys, do I have to give 
that out to anyone?  I used my email address, which I may not want the recipient
of my message having.

Anyway.. the 2 ring files it created, were not fit for ascii printing.
(I hope this is normal)

I used pgp -kxa <myuserid> public.asc to try to get the one to send out to 
people in cyberland.  It did create public.asc, and it looked like most peoples
public keys that I encounter every once in awhile.  

Is this public.asc I created what I should send out to people I want to receive 
my encrypted messages?  now what?  anyone care to help
me out with sending my first encrypted message via email.. 

of course, first, I need to know what to do next..

someone PLEASE EMAIL MY ANONID if willing to help.

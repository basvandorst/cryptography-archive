I tried to email you, but it bounced.  Here is my reply.

uu{en,de}code is/are unix utilities to turn eight bit data into seven
bit data for transmission though modems that use the eighth bit for
parity.  Its biggest problem is that not all of the characters that it
uses exist in both ascii and ebcdic (and I assume from your email
address that you are on an ebcdic machine).  There is an excellent
chance that the message has already be garbled irrecoverably.

I don't have the source handy, you can find it easily through the
archie command and then ftp it.  If you are on the net, you may have
archie available to you already, just type "archie" for help.  If no
one else sends you the source and you don't have/can't use archie,
email me.

If the message was garbled, you might want to ask your correspondent to
use a different encoding program.  The email RFCs suggest using a
special base64 encoding that while it is slightly less efficient that
the UU programs, only uses the characters a-z, A-z, 0-9, plus(+), and
slash(/), which are common to ascii, ebcdic, and other even more exotic
character sets.  I do have the source for these, again if you want it,
send me some email.

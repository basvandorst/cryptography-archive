Yes, he did err in DARING to QUESTION a dictum from Big Brother.  And
faxing them with points and inconvenient questions must have enraged
the NSA termendously.  I mean, what in hell does a commoner like that
think he is doing?  One does not do that with one's masters.

The proper response would have been to snap to and say, "Yessir!!".

Yes, we must be VERY careful what we say and HOW we say it, for fear
of offending our masters.  They might stomp on a person with 'incorrect
desires' with an iron boot for expressing those desires.  If a person
has incorrect ambitions or thoughts, he must be a 'terrorist'.  Squash
him.

It does show what our 'free country' has become.  If one dares to question
any dictum Big Brother cares to make, that person must be taken down.
Such behavior obviously cannot be tolerated in the New Order.

What WAS Grady's offense, besides opposing a decree?

Clearly, we cannot have commoners talking back to their masters, can we?

It does bring up an interesting question:  What better way to be able
to live up to a promise to not ban alternate crypto, than crucifying
anybody who dares to try to come up with an alternative that is useful,
by invoking ITAR however they damn well please, and making an example
to put the 'fear of God' in anybody else who might want to produce
an alternatve?

Think on it, how can ANYONE GUARANTEE that a dreaded foreign national
cannot acquire a copy of one's package if they distribute it at all?
ANd this would make an excellent example to deter anybody else who is
considering making their own strong product available.  I can hear it:
"We don't ban alternative non-escroed crypto.  However, seems nobody is
producing anything - can't understand why, for the live of us <snicker>"

Why aren't the few big outfits producing crypto being harassed?  Beyond
the fact that most use schemes that are trivial for NSA to crack, Its
called SELECTIVE ENFORCEMENT.  Most of the packags are of limited
flexibility, and only available as a part of large, expensive packages
only useable on one platform, not source code that can be flexible as
to usage and used on many platforms.  Why take them on, when one can
put the fear of God in the small operators?  The bigger ones, who don't
care one way or another, will happily and quietly put back doors in
their products if the NSA tells them to do so, as long as it doesn't
affect their bottom line (and it won't).  But idealistic small operators
aren't inclined to do that.  So, go after the small guys.  Not to mention,
its MUCH cheaper, they don't have the funds or batterys of lawyers to
make a good fight.  A good example will probably make the larger operaters
more ... er...  'cooperative', also.

In other words, go after a 'soft' target if available.  Always a sound
strategy.

What has that got to do with anything?  Who is the Grand Jury there to
indict?  Idi Amin?  It is a FORMALITY, most Fed Grand Juries are little
more than a rubber stamp.  They want all his stuff - now do you really
think that means 'copies' or do you think that means his equipment is
no longer his for all intents and purposes?   Has government accepted
'copies' provided at the targets discretion in the past?  I will be most
surprised if they don't manage to stick SOMETHING to Grady.  They want
an example to make.  They got one.

It seems obvious that Grady is gonna need some backing up.  Is the EFF
watching this, and will they jump in if the NSA decides to really stick
it to him?  I doubt if the ACLU will do anything, it doesn't go along
with their agenda.  They haven't been too strong on the basic rights stuff
in recent years.  Abortion, prayer in schools, etc is their field these
days.  Not things like the RKBA, rights to privacy from Big Brother,
or the BOR in general, all seem to get short shrift.  Or so it seems.

Does that count the GOVERNMENT making attacks on 'incorrect' thinkers?

Yes, I am dismayed, and disgusted.  But not surprised.

Of course, if you're a small-time terrorist, a nuclear fizzle is just fine.
Maybe you can get a big enough kaboom to knock over the World Trade Center,
unlike the recent chemical-explosive fizzle, but even if you can't,
nuclear contamination can be pretty nasty stuff, and a good dose of thermite 
to set your bomb on fire if it doesn't explode is a useful backup...

There was an article in Scientific American a couple years ago about
the different US and USSR approaches to controlling strategic nukes;
I don't remember the details, but the philosophies were quite different.
And tactical nukes are probably not as well controlled as strategic ones,
as well as much more portable.

   could be bald-faced lies. My sources are not highly credible,
   consisting of various conversations with physicists a few
   years ago, after I read a somewhat sensationalist book by
   some idiot (I forget his name) who did a lot of research on
   this stuff, claims he figured out how h-bombs work, and
   wanted to publish a book on them. 

You may be remembering John Aristotle Philips's book;
he designed an A-bomb as a junior-year physics project at Princeton
back in the late 1970s.  (He was an average student, and needed a
really high-class project to bring his grades up to adequate.)
The Pakistanis tried to buy his physics paper from him, at the same
time they were negotiating to get "purely commercial non-military"
nuclear reactor aid from the US govt.  Alternatively, I think the
article in The Progressive was H-bomb related.

A 50Mt bomb may be pretty big--that's probably why warheads
of that size aren't used much, if at all. But an ICBM Re-entry
Vehicle or an 8 inch shell are quite small. FedEx will deliver
them, and they'd most certainly fit in any surface-to-surface
missile, in a propeller driven cruise missile, etc.

Sorry, but that's baloney and several inches thick. Posting bitch messages
here is hardly a way to get Congress or the Administration to act. The way
to do it is to find an area where policy is wrong, and communicate with
them.

In the case of the subpoenas, they are discovery subpoenas in front of a
grand jury. We don't even know whether the parties summoned are potential
defendants, or simply those with material information about yet another
potential defendant. The process, though highly inconvenient, is
unexceptionable and THAT is something neither Congress nor the President
will act on, because it doesn't involve crypto specifically at this stage,
but the basic grand jury process.

In the case of the State Department letter saying that if you make crypto
stuff (as they define it) you have to register, you could write to State or
Congress, but I doubt it would do any good at this stage. A far more likely
way to get it handled is via a court decision adverse to the regs, if one
happens.

I have never called anyone a fool, and by so suggesting you are revealing
your level of reading comprehension.

I may have suggested that certain acts are foolish at this stage (see above
for details), but that is quite another matter. They are foolish in that
they won't produce the result because given the stage of the process they
cannot, and are thus not only a waste of time, but also create a climate of
wolf-crying that will get the real wolf-cry later ignored.

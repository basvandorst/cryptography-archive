Well this doesn't seem to apply anymore. According to the letter sent to
Austin Code Works, all companies who manufacture, even if they aren't
being exported have to now register. This means that all the free BSDs with
the BSD crypt software have to register since they manufactured them and
they seem to be on the munitions list. I include the part that I draw
this conclusion from:

----
We take this opportunity of advise you that any company or 
individual who engages in the United State in the business of 
either manufacturing or exporting defense articles or 
furnishing defense services is required to register for a fee 
with the Office of Defense Trade Controls (DTC) pursuant to 22 
U.S.C. # 2778(b)(1)(A) and 22 C.F.R. Part 122.
----

It clearly states that any company or individual who manufactures OR
exports must register.

Just another person's opinion.

Ciao,

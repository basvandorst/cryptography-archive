    I think you have it backwards David.  If Grady seeks to hire a
distributor for the export market because he does not want to deal
with the various laws and regulations involving export, that makes it
clear that neither Grady or Austin Code Works is acting as an
exporter.  Many companies prefer to export only through agents for
just this reason.  So I consider Grady's search for an export agent as
an appropriate and cautious act.  (Note that in this case dealing with
a US company as an export agent might simplify things, but that is a
detail.)

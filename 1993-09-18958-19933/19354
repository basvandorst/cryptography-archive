Surprizingly little has been done, but look for:

Ganesan, Ravi and Sherman Alan T.  
"Statistical Techniques for Language Recognition,
An Introduction and Guide for Cryptanalysis"
to appear in Cryptologia

They model language as a Markov source and develop statistical 
tests to distiguish various languages.  The paper has been 
accepted for publication, but I don't know when it will appear.

The paper gives a lot of references to statistical work useful
in plaintext recognition, almost all of which was done in other
fields.

This paper is mostly theoretical, and they may follow up with 
an empirical study.

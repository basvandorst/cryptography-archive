	Match heads do contain Potassium chlorate and some red phosphorus. 
I have notes on making matches, but they are elsewhere.  So all of this is
from memory.  White phosphorus reacts with the air to form a poisoness gas,
I believe PO5.  We did a lab with it before, where we dissolved it in
mineral oil (took a few weeks) and then rubbed it on our gloves.  When the
phosphorus oxidized with the air, it gave off a glow.  The phosphorus
concentration was little enough so that we didn't have to worry about the gas.
A KClO3 and Sulfer mixture is very sensitive and could be put on the match stick.
Allowed to dry, it would harden on.

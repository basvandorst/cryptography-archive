|Well, first we need to clarify the difference between SECURITY RISK and
|RISK.  The main risk of not having memory protection is that one
|process can corrupt another.  For example, NLM X might overwrite the
|base server code, thus crashing the entire server.  If memory
|protection were in use, if NLM X tried to access memory it was not
|supposed to, a protection fault would be generated, and NLM X could be
|terminated, and the server would remain stable.
|
|There really is no security risk.  NLMs are supposed to be able to
|access anything (i.e. they have the same access rights as SUPERVISOR). 
|If Novell implemented memory protection, presumably NLMs would still be
|given these unrestricted rights.  If you feel NLMs should not have
|supervisor rights, then that is a valid point, but it is a separate
|issue from memory protection.  Essentially, NLMs are assumed to be
|trusted, since, if you didn't trust them, you *as supervisor) would not
|have loaded them.  (although, if we want to allow untrusted NLMs to be
|loaded, but restrict their access rights, then it is essential to
|*also* have memory protection, otherwise, the NLM could overwrite the
|part of the server code that implements access restrictions on NLMs).

}	In the case of medium to large LANS I agree with Mr. Murry
}s to trying to run a raft of services on one server.  The way to go
}is to split services and try to place the diffrent servers on the
}net segment that most uses those services.  But that is throughput
}opt. not security.
}
}	In the case of smaller LANs the economic reality is that you
}ave to load multipal services on one server.  The smaller LAN user
}s at times hard put even to afford the LAN they have, of course if
}t goes away they can't afford that.
}
}	When we consider installing or our clients request a new NLM
}we insist on a two week test at our site on the isolated server.  What
}I will do is load a copy of the target system; or a general server model,
}and the new NLM and then load the server.  We run this for a week or so
}with a few workstations making a large number of requests.  If the NLM has
}ot failed, currupted other code in the server and performed it's tasks
}properly we will load it for our customer(s)
}

In light of the above discussion could one say that 4.0
	"cannot isolate the resources to be protected
	^^^^^^^
	so that they are subject to the access control
	and auditing requirements"
Here resources include subjects and objects in the system.

If this were true then can 4.0 be C2 compliant  
or is there something amiss in here.

Perhaps Phil and I disagree here, but I think making a public forum
for discussing, arguing, complaining, and praising government actions
is fundamental to democracy.

I would reluctantly but willingly go to jail for 10 years if it meant
that strong crypto were opened up for everyone.  My two young sons,
I hope, would not expect anything else when they are old enough to understand.

Fortunately, I don't think that kind of sacrifice will be required since
I have not broken the letter or the spirit of the law and I think
disobediance to the law should be reserved for very special cases indeed.

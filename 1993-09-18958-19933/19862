You have to validate the compiler too, or the attacker will just put the 
trapdoor there instead. There was an article on this about ten years ago
(a Turing lecture I think) - the writer showed how you could propagate an
access control loophole in this way. Indeed, you could even use the `bad'
compiler to compile uncontaminated compiler source, and end up with a 
copy of itself - which makes detection a bit tricky.

On the other hand, identifying an executable by means of a digital
signature is fairly straightforward.

Some of that re-bar was used in a hotel in San Felipe, Baja Calif.  The
hotel sat half built for several years after they found out about it.
The re-bar was cast in concrete whick reportedly would stop the
radiation but there was concern about whether it would weaken the
concrete.  Supposedly it was replaced and/or reinforced....

Personally I don't think I'll be staying in that hotel.

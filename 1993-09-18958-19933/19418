You're not the only one who is confused, until the details emerge. But there
are three separate issues.

1. Patents on the RSA algorithm/methods. This is a civil matter for PKP and
it is unlikely the Feds would be involved here.

2. Export of PGP without a license. This is definitely a Federal matter, and
there's some history about PGP which goes back some time. It's not yet clear
whether the Feds are interested in current activities, or what got PGP out
of the U.S. (and back?) in the first place.

3. Import of IDEA. PGP uses the Swiss IDEA encryption method for message
encryption (after using RSA to encrypt the IDEA key for the particular
message). One party tells me one needs an IMPORT license for this. Several
others insist one does not. I don't know which set of assertions is
accurate, but again, we'll see after the Grand Jury acts (or doesn't).

I don't know what time of day he faxed the NSA, but as I recall the subpoena 
was served very late in the evening (10:30pm?).  I'm willing to give _real_ 
good odds that the NSA can get a subpeona from a Federal Judge to stop such an 
obvious threat to national security (their perception - I don't know) in less 
time than that.

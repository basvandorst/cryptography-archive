Grady, May I suggest that you and any associates you may have who are
also involved in the fracas with the NSA invest in a microcassette
recorder and carry it with you at all times. They cost about $30. If you
were to be subjected to civil forfeiture, a government raid, or
assaulted by federal agents, the tape recording may be the thing that
saves your hide and/or your belongings when you get to court. Note that
revealing the fact that you are taping said agents will probably result
in the destruction of the tape and recorder.

It is my opinion that The US Departments of Justice and the Treasury are
totally out of control and will stop at nothing to accomplish their
aims which mostly relate to their remaining in power.

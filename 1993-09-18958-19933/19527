Kahn's "The Codebreakers" contains many stories about the encrypted
communications you mention, but always in the context of the goverment
cryptanalyzing them (usually successfully) for use in criminal
prosecutions.

What's noteworthy is the amount of effort that went into the analyses,
and the lack of any mention of forcing the defendants to decrypt the
materials. This would seem to indicate that, at least in the past, the
government has not felt it had either the right or the need to force
suspects to reveal encryption keys or methods.

Of course, now that publicly available ciphers are so much stronger
(quite possibly unbreakable in practice), the government might now
feel the need to force the issue.

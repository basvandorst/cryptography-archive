Wouldn't this be an important distinction from crypto _software_?

And if you were in the liquor business, and the folks that came swooping in
to shut you down were the SEC?  Complying with the regulations for a
business class is all well and good - Grady appears to have followed those
rules for _his_ class of business: software authoring.  He doesn't appear
to have done anything particularly new and unique (sorry, Grady!) other
than to bring information from several different sources into _one_
program - and he isn't even trying to sell the executable version of that
program!

To follow your analogy, Grady has followed the Liquor Laws, but has been
busted by the SEC because one of the wines he sells is made by a company
the SEC doesn't like.  Fair?  I think not.

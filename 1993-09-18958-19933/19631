That part is interesting.  As one correspondent remarked, he had tried
some time to elicit information about what was permissible and what was
not, to no avail.  Only recently there appears to be some information
forthcoming.  I think that if even the controlling agencies are not
able to adequately address this issue, the concept of overly vague
can come into it.

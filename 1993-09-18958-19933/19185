The reason for such locking is so you can go to court or threaten to go
to court.

There are legal and practical grey areas in how many copies you can have
of a program and on how many computers you can run them, what with backups,
one-user-at-a-time, upgrading or replacing computers, and so on.

There is little grey about the creation or even possession of a "debugged"
copy of such a program.

As has often been said for literally decades, the main problems computer
vendors have is not with their end users, but with their distributors and
resellers.  The big bucks to be made by bending a lisense contract are
generally not with individual end users but the last step in the chain
before the end user, including big corporate purchasing organizations and
big company support groups.  The effort such a distributor must spend to
break a lock is enough to keep them from doing it, by reminding them of
their contractual obligations, where they won't think twice about
"accidentally" running a "backup copy" or "forgetting to remove" a lisensed
product from a new machine.

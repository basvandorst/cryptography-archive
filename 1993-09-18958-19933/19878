	It occurs to me that, yeah, someone changing their password often
	will make an exhaustive search much harder (i.e., they might have
	already searched the combination you've changed it to), *but*, if
	someone has a set of encrypted files that they want to decrypt, the
	new password is irrelavent--you can't change it retroactively.

	It is true that breaking a few files may not be what the snoop
	is looking for, but it should be noted.

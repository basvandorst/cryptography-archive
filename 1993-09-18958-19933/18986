1. The asking password is the wrong way because it`s simply overheading.

2. For example mr. B must identify of mr. C. Mr. B give to C random number x,
then C compute y=f(x) and return it to B. The f() is sicret function,
but this function can be simple. For example x must has 4 digits and
y= first two digits minus last two digit plus 157 (x=9876, y=98-76+157).
Now mr. B can chack answer of mr. C. Every time x and y different and
overheading does not work.

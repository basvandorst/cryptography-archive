If the plaintext is random noise, then you're right, there's no way
to tell when your brute-force attack has gotten a hit.  Compression
(with no headers!) does generally help, which is why people often
compress data before encrypting it.  For your other examples,
checking to see whether the zero-order entropy is significantly less
than a bit per bit will flag correct-looking decryptions, and is
pretty easy to do.

Well, think of it this way: an 8-round DES is weak, and another
8-round DES is weak, but a 16-round DES is pretty good.  Or don't,
if you'd really rather not.

If your opponent doesn't know about it, it's not surprising that even
a toy PRNG laid over the data will confuse a brute-force attack that
assumes it's looking for English ASCII text.  Once you assume it's
known, it doesn't look as helpful.

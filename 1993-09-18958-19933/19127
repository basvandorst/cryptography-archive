This is scarcely sci.crypt material, but look guys, you do not need an
ICBM, MX, or any such device as a delivery system. All you need is a
truck. Maybe a pickup, with a cab. Easy in your average U-Haul, if they
do have the truck you reserved;-}.

And, if you are not willing to go up along with your victims, there is
a secret device you can use - a timer. Park, set the timer, & take the
next flight to Rio. 

And if it is a low-yield device, place it carefully. There is one sure
place you can put it that will greatly multiply the fatality rate &
area. I'll omit this fact, but that's little help; I'm sure those
willing to do something like this will have thought of it.

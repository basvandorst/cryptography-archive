   [ Hypothetical story of having files subpoenaed, being able to show

   Anyway, I just don't want to be put in the position where I could
   be coerced into revealing potentially private information about a
   user on my system.  That is why I want to make some form of encryption
   available to all users.  They don't have to use it if they don't
   want to, but I want to offer them the choice.

   Besides, how many sites does an email message go through (in plain text)
   before it reaches its destination?  I don't like the idea that anyone
   with privies can read MY email while it is in transit.  That is why I
   personally want and will use some form of public key encryption.


You can give your users this either by using a public-key-based system
like PGP or RIPEM (RIPEM is better from a legal standpoint, but you'd
be best off with one of the newer triple-DES versions as single-DES
keeps getting shakier), (if you charge money for using your system,
that probably clearly violates the non-commercial-use constraints in
the RSAREF license, so you can't use RIPEM either)
or you can give them a simple symmetric-key algorithm.
You could also use a crypto-based file system or disk interface.

The fun thing to do with public key would be to automagically encrypt
all their incoming mail messages (one at a time, presumably),
which you can do without having to know their secret keys.
It's neat, though it does play havoc with friendly mail readers :-);
they'd either need a crypto-aware mail reader.
A simple implementation, which users can do themselves if you're
running a classic Unix / sendmail system, is to set their mail
forwarder to pipe their incoming mail to 
	pgp -fea their-userid | something-to-save-each-file

What you can't do with it is claim that that gives them really secure email,
if they're dialing/telneting in to your machine and reading it there.
They're still open to wiretap, and still open to getting their
passwords and messages stolen on your machine, either by you
(if you're really a Bad Guy in disguise, or being blackmailed/coerced)
or by crackers breaking your machine's security.

First, admit sincerely - you have not actually read the new RSA FAQ before
jumping on the keyboard to post a follow-up, have you? In fact, you
don't need to read it - it is enough to grep for the word PGP using
either the Unix grep or TGrep for the PC or TextSearch from Norton
Utilities, or any other of the zillions text retrieving tools
available. The result will be: 0, zero, nil, zip, nada.

Considering the Grand Jury subpoena order on ViaCrypt - the company
that was supposed to distribute the legal version of PGP in the USA,
you might still have to wait a while until you see it...

The FAQ is expected at least to mention this controversy.

It doesn't have to be publicity for PGP - they could be at least a tad
objective - like the author of the RIPEM FAQ, for instance. After all,
the document is titled to be a FAQ, not a subjective advertisement of
PKP and its products...

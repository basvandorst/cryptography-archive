No.  Knuth's _Seminumerical Algorithms_ mentions a way to break such
a system; his scheme relates to a simple linear congruential
generator, but it can be generalized to more elaborate schemes.

However, if you use a cryptographically strong random number
generator, such as RSA MD5, or DES, or whatever, this technique is as
secure as the generator is difficult to predict.

If the noise sequence is truly random, the encryption is unbreakable,
as proved by Shannon.

That is a Very Big Question which cannot easily be answered.  Indeed,
from a theoretical point of view it cannot be answered at all until
someone proves that P != NP.

And he hasn't exported anything either. (According to Grady).

Doesn't this bother you?  The government seems to be opening an investigation
into something they suspect somebody _might_ do, and imposing on those people
all the weight of producing themselves and attendant records before a G.J.
It did not continue a dialog to resolve the matter, even though the subjects
were demonstrably willing (as evidenced by the pre-subpoena fax) to keep
dialoging.

You seem to tend toward "the government is just doing its job and
nobody should panic because this is all normal procedure and the government
couldn't possibly have any malice in this they're just the govt after all."

But I've seen first hand, right here in Ventura County, that the government
can be malicious, and deadly. You may remember the case of David
Scott, shot to death in his home early one Saturday morning at his spacious
Malibu ranch during a raid of some dozen DEA, FBI, and LASD officers. They
had a trumped up warrant (somebody saw his wife with a few hundred dollar
bills in Malibu. In Malibu!) to look for pot cultivation. No sign of drugs
of any kind was ever found. Oddly, though, the agencies had already filed
asset forfeiture papers on the ranch _before_ the raid.  When the no-knock
warrant was served, Scott thought he was being robbed, and held a gun over
his head. When he attempted to comply with a warning to drop the weapon,
he was shot dead. All within 30 seconds of the crash entry. The Ventura County
DA publicly called, and still calls, the raid a deliberate attempt to grab 
Scott's million dollar estate. 

The LASD has quelled all LA-based investigations. The Ventura DA has been
censured (but not moved). The heirs cannot get the estate back.

The government bears watching.

I don't think any netter would disagree with you here. But Phil's
lawyer has a very important point. So far, nobody has taken action
against either of you. Neither a grand jury investigation nor 
subpeonas imply that any action will be taken. But making an enemy
of the prosecutor can turn an otherwise neutral person into your
most dangerous enemy. If a prosecutor wants to be a jerk, he can 
ruin your life for a long period of time, even if there is no 
evidence that you did anything wrong. (I'll leave it to others 
to cite examples.)

So far, the prosecutor may only be investigating, based upon
a request from NSA/State, to see *whether* you've broken any 
laws. If it's clear you haven't, he may not be interested in 
wasting his time. If you make an enemy of him, he might be 
quite eager to waste his time just to "show you."

Let's wait for the indictment, if any. You are right to be
letting people know that this is going on. But don't ask for
action, *yet*. If you are indicted, I and dozens (thousands?) 
of netters will be there with letters and legal defense 
donations. Don't cry, "a mi la legion" until you need it.

OTOH, if you just want to be prosecuted, you can always go 
urinate on the courthouse steps...

It has already been done on an Amiga Computer.
There are two programs that I know of that encrypt digitized voice in
real-time, and send it over the modem to be decrypted on the other
side in real time...

J> 4:1) assuming the stream will actually compress that much, or
J> that you can compress it that much before encrypting and pushing

The program TWC for the Amiga can digitize voice, compress, and do
on the fly encryption and send it to another Amiga to be decrypted.
You can set the voice sampling rate as high as you wish, though you
would probably need at least a 68020 or higher to get good quality.

Another program that I have tested is called Lazarus V.mod, and it
too can digitize incoming voice and encrypt it and send it along the
phone/modem line to another Amiga.

Sampling rates of 9000 samples/sec as possible with compression on
a 25mhz 68030 based machine.  I would probably expect double, maybe
even triple that on a 68040.  But then, the limiting factor would
again come into play: Transfer Rate... I believe phone line quality
on most phones hover around 16k-18k...

The difference between the two are that TWC will allow bi-directional
file transfers to occur at the same time... (thought the cps would
probably suffer badly while transmitting voice, but text does not
hurt the cps rate).  Both allow for full multitasking, and only use
a little CPU time, how they can do this is that they rely heavily
upon the Custom VLSI chips of the Amiga.. If anyone wants to try
and port Lazarus to the PC I might be able to get the C source..
but the author told me it would be almost impossible, and there
would be no multitasking.

I urge anyone with an Amiga computer to get both programs and try them
out.  Currently, TWC uses a simple encryption method, while Lazarus uses
IDEA(?)... But hopefully the author of TWC will incorporate IDEA into his
program as well.

I disagree with this.  Discussion here on Usenet influences people's
thinking.  Based on their thinking, they cast their votes.  If enough
Usenet readers realize the importance of this issue, there is a
possibility that they will vote differently during the next elections.
Short-term changes can come from direct action, but long-term changes
come only from a fundamental change in our thinking.

Every government agency in the US ultimately implements the so-called
'will of the people', as indirectly expressed in the chain:

   votes -> congress -> legislation -> bahavior of government agency

The NSA, like every other government agency, behaves the way it does
because of its mandate, because of its philosphy, and because of what the
law requires and allows it to do.  Change its mandate, change what the law
requires and allows it to do, and its philosphy and behavior will change to
conform.

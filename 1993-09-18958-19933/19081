A STU-III consists of three main parts:

A lossy voice compressor (vocoder). Either 2400bps LPC-10, described
in FED-STD-1015, or 4800bps CELP, described in FED-STD-1016. (CELP
sounds *much* better than LPC-10).

An encryptor/decryptor. There are two types of STU-IIIs: Type 1, which
uses classified NSA algorithms and is approved for classified traffic,
and Type 2, which I *believe* uses DES and is approved only for
unclassified (but sensitive) traffic. It appears that Type 1 STUs can
talk to Type 2 STUs, but only in the unclassified mode.

A telephone modem. A variety of modulation formats are used, including
V.27ter and V.32. Some minor modifications are made, mainly to support
transitions between voice and data (i.e., nonsecure and secure voice)
within a call by either party. The 2400 bps modem also supports half
duplex transmission as an option for very poor channels.

As far as the transmission channel is concerned, a STU-III is just a
data modem. So if you can't get the modem to work over your channel,
you can't talk securely. Analog FM cellphones are notorious for not
supporting modems very reliably.

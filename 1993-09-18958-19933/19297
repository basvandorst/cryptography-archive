It doesn't actually contain source code, but Annex C (Annex D in the
'93 draft) of CCITT X.509 / ISO9594-8 describes the methods of RSA
with some algebraic notation describing the math involved.  If that
weren't strong enough, they cite the RSA paper "Rivest, R.L., Shamir,
A., and Adleman, L.  A Method for Obtaining Digital Signatures and
Public-key Cryptosystems, Communications of the ACM, 21, 2 (February
1978), 120-126."

I haven't read the RSA paper, but I would guess that it (and/or the
RSA patent application itself) disclose the details sufficiently that
any competent programmer could create an executable, which IMHO is a
reasonable argument in your favour.  Having source merely saves a
programmer some time vs. implementing the code from a description.  If
this were not the case, Knuth's books on programming would have been
virtually useless since he describes his algorithms in a pseudo-code
he came up with himself.  Luckily, we programmers aren't quite that
dumb :-)

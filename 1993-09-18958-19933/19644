Now that raises an interesting variation: what if, instead of publishing
the actual algorithms themselves, you had published a bibliography
telling people where to find the algorithms in other sources?  Would
State be claiming that such a bibliography is some kind of
"meta-algorithm," or an algorithm for locating other algorithms?  More
to the point, would an annotated or unannotated bibliography of
cryptographic materials be considered a cryptographic material itself?

Some mailers apparently munge my address; you might have to use
bsmart@bsmart.tti.com -- or if that fails, fall back to

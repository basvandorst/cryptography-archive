Correction:  Safety matches have the red phosphorous in the striker
(the "sandpaper" on the matchbook), and the match head contains potassium
chlorate and some fuels.  Potassium chlorate + red P + (very little) friction
= fire (or boom!).  Don't know about strike-anywhere match tips, but they
likely contain K chlorate + a substance K chlorate is friction sensitive with,
but not _too_ sensitive.. (White P is much too poisonous to use anymore,
though it used to be used.  It also has an annoying habit of igniting if it
gets a little warm (about 90F or so))

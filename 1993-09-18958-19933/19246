Firstly chuck mnp 3, 4 or 5 away. Use a CCITT standard, v42bis.

Error rates on modern lines are probably low enough for block latency to not
be a problem. In fact v32, v32bis, v32ter, PEP etc. would probably allow
retransmission of blocks. That is the bandwidth would be larger than the
data rate requires. I'm no expert so I may be wrong.

The encryption would not be a problem on a fastish PC or modern MAC.
The form of encryption might pose a problem. Random access to the datastream
may be required to insert retansmitted blocks. This suggests using CFB would
problematic, although if the block-sized used by the modems protocol is
greater or equal to the number of bits produced, by the encryption, between
synchronisation of the registers then CFB could be used.
CBC gets around this but is weaker than CFB.

The real problem with a home-brew crypto-phone, this was my initial plan for
my final-year CS project, is the audio compression. LPC will reduce a mu-law
64kb datastream down to 4800bits but requires a LOT of processing to do so,
or dedicated hardware. There are two NATO standards for CELP which produce
4800bps and 2400bps, CELP is supposed to sound more 'human' than LPC though
I have not heard either in use. CELP code also exists for some TI DSPs and
I would guess that the new AV MACs and the Mwave(?) IBM/TI DSP would be
suitable targets for porting.

Of course if you are willing to pay for a DSP you may as well buy a commercial
crypto-phone.

Besides CLIPPER will be good enough for us. Unless you're a nutty conspiracy
theorist.

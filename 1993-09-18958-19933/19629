Thanks for editing out the inappropriate newsgroups. Mostly I respond to
stuff, and the newsgroups get propagated. When I post a new thread it's
almost always to a single newsgroup--the one I happen to be in when the new
topic occurs to me.

More accurately I should have said (and the context of all the discussions
make this clear) export without a license is illegal and Grady/Austin not
only has not got a license but also hasn't applied for one.

Sorry if the shorthand misled you.

By the way, some here would object to the way you edited the Newsgroups list
since they'd argue this conversation belongs in talk.politics.crypto, not
sci.crypt, but I'm going to leave it where you put it.

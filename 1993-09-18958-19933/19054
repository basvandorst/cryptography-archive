The big problem I can see is encrypting the software for the chip.
Unless you go through the incredible pain of having a central site
doing the encryption (boy, that would be popular - go out to buy
Ultima VIII, which you've been waiting for for months, then wait a
week for your encrypted copy to arrive), the encryption software is
going to have to be fairly widespread, and it's going to get out.
You've got an advantage in that copies given to stores can be set to
only run on their CPUs (more lines), but it's still going to get out,
in the same way which pirate groups get copies of software before it's
released.  And all you need is for one copy to get out.

Heck, even if it worked perfectly and nobody ever got the encryption
algorithm, you've got a much worse problem:  who's going to buy one of
these monstrosities?  Not me, that's for sure.  I can see someone
buying an "AutoCAD station," but for general use, no way.

And, of course, such a system, if in place and widespread, would be
way too tempting a target for government takeover - sorry, we can't
sell you a system, you're on our non-approved list.

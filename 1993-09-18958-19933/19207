We have an 8085 processor going to an environment where some of it's memory
(128Kb of EEPROM) will be susceptible to occasional bit-flips. Power and weight
constraints make it preferable to not have hardware-based error detection and
correction (not even parity). I'm looking for an appropriate software approach
to catching and repairing such errors, and cost (processing time and storage
utilization) versus benefit (percent 1 & 2-bit errors caught and/or corrected).

Any suggestions, references, or more appropriate newsgroups :) ?
E-mail replies preferred. Thanks!

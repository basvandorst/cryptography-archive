No. If you are _in the business_ of manufacturing (or exporting) then
you have to register. There's a difference. There are also several
exceptions: United States government officials; ``persons whose
pertinent business activity is confined to the production of
unclassified technical data only''; Atomic Energy Act licensees; and
``persons who engage only in the fabrication of articles for
experimental or scientific purpose, including research and
development.''

   Sorry you've made that mistake.  The machine instructions which illuminate
the phosphors on your screen reside in your own computer or terminal.  What
Art sent was ASCII code; your computer or terminal has machine instructions to
take the code he (or anyone) sent, or for that matter any text file you can
feed it (which is written in the same code), and make phosphors light on your
screen.  I used a set of machine instructions called 'rn'; 'rn' reads the
ASCII code from your message and sends it to more machine instructions in the
operating system, and this set of instructions does whatever it takes to
instruct still another piece of hardware (terminal, video card, etc.) to
light up phosphors on my screen.  I sincerely doubt you executed
'1993Sep24.083049.17039' to read Art's message; you probably executed a
newsreader, which translated his ASCII code, using the newsreader's machine
instructions, into phosphors lit on your screen.
   If you believe otherwise, try saving this article to a disk file, then
use whatever mechanism your operating system supports to execute that disk
file.  (A DOS example; "debug [filename]", then "g".  I believe for /bin/sh
". ./[filename] will do it if you chmod the file to be executable.)  If
this article consists of machine instructions, your CPU will flawlessly
execute them and light phosphors on your screen identical to those you
see now.  If it's ASCII code, as I assert, it will execute the code in whatever
way the machine interprets it; most computers will find the machine's
interpretation to be instructions to do random and incoherent things, if
indeed every code it finds is an instruction the machine understands at all.
   Hope you can extricate yourself from the damage that results...

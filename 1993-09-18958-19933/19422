PGP 2.* was developed in Europe. It was not xported _from_ the US but was
imported _to_ it. PGP 1.* was exported, I was one of the persons that 
downloaded it to Holland and distributed it here throughout europe.

Why should it be illegal to export PGP to other countries but the US if
PGP was not even developed in the US ??

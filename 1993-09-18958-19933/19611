   False.  Sorry to be so blunt, but .... false.  THe first amendment
   covers all speech.  It may be that certain forms of "commercial speech" 
   are entitled to a lesser form of protection than classic political
   speech, but the test is NOT historical in any case.  

Ultimately the law means what you can get juries or courts to agree on.
Sure, the first amendment *says* it's about all speech, but the courts
have tolerated rabidly offensive violations of it; in _Schenk_,
the Supreme Court upheld the conviction of someone writing pamphlets
against the war and the draft before the US was even in it,
and cases involving military censorship and regulation of commerce 
have been decided badly before.

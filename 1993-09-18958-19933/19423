Ok, ok - me dumb.

Here's another kick at the can....

Caller A - who must determine if caller B has the key without in any way
REVEALING the key - masks the key - which is n bits long - by XORing it
with a random mask, and sends it over the insecure channel.

Caller B sends back 2n bits.

Caller A XORs them with the random mask and gets 2 key-length bit
streams.

Caller A then scans across the key and applies this rule to check on
caller B.

If the first bit of the key is a 1 - the first bit of the FIRST of the 2
n bit strings B send back must be 1. The first bit of the SECOND string
can be - in fact must be - random.

If the first bit of the key is a 0 then the first bit of the SECOND bit
string must be a 1. The corosponding bit in the FIRST stream is random.

You scan across all n of the key bits applying this rule to the input 2n
bit stream.

If it holds all the way across, A must accept that B knows the key.

I believe that there's no obvious holes in this one, and the probability
of a false acceptance is 2^-n - same as guessing the key.

Also - if you wanted to, you could add a THIRD n-bit stream such that it
creates a parity for the other two position wise...

Comments?

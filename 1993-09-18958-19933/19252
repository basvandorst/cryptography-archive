<6.1> What UNIX programs are related to privacy?

  For more information, type `man [cmd]' or `apropos [keyword]' at the
  UNIX shell prompt.

    passwd - change password
    finger - obtain information about a remote user
    chfn   - change information about yourself obtainable by remote
             users (sometimes `passwd -f')
    chmod  - change the rights associated with a file or directory
    umask  - (shell) change the default (on creation) file access
             rights
    ls     - list the rights associated with files and directories
    xhost  - allow or disable access control of particular users to an
             Xwindow server
    last   - list the latest user logins on the system and their
             originations
    who    - list other users, login/idle times, originations
    w      - list other users and what they are running
    xhost  - access control list for X Window client use
    xauth  - control X Window server authentication
    
    .signature  - file in the home directory appended to USENET posts
    .forward    - file used to forward email to other accounts
    .Xauthority - file used for X Window server authentication keys
    $SIGNATURE  - variable used for name in email and USENET postings

  The `tcpdump' packet-tracing program is loosely based on SMI's
  "etherfind".  It was originally written by Van Jacobson, Lawrence
  Berkeley Laboratory, as part of an ongoing research project to
  investigate and improve tcp and internet gateway performance.  A
  current version is available via anonymous ftp from host
  ftp.ee.lbl.gov (currently at address 128.3.254.68) file
  tcpdump.tar.Z (a compressed Unix tar file).

<6.2> How can I learn about or use cryptography?

  A general introduction to mostly theoretical cryptographic issues,
  especially those frequently discussed in sci.crypt, is available
  in FAQ form:

  >  Compiled by:
  >        cme@ellisun.sw.stratus.com (Carl Ellison)
  >        Gwyn@BRL.MIL (Doug Gwyn)
  >        smb@ulysses.att.com (Steven Bellovin)

  NIST (U.S. National Institute for Standards and Technology)
  publishes an introductory paper on cryptography, special
  publication 800-2 ``Public-Key Cryptograhy'' by James Nechvatal
  (April 1991).  Available via anonymous FTP from
  csrc.ncsl.nist.gov (129.6.54.11), file pub/nistpubs/800-2.txt. 
  Also via available anonymous FTP from wimsey.bc.ca as crypt.txt.Z
  in the crypto directory.  Covers technical mathematical aspects
  of encryption such as number theory.

  More general information can be found in a FAQ by Paul Fahn of RSA
  Labortories via anonymous FTP from rsa.com in /pub/faq.ps.Z.  See
  the `readme' file for information on the `tex' version.  Also
  available as hardcopy for $20 from   RSA Laboratories, 100 Marine
  Parkway, Redwood City, CA  94065.  Send questions to
  faq-editor@rsa.com.

  Phil Zimmerman's PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) package for public key
  encryption is available at numerous sites, and is in widespread use
  over the internet for general PC-, Macintosh-, and UNIX-based file
  encryption (including email).  Consult the archie FTP database. 
  Also see the newsgroup alt.security.pgp.  Mailing list requests to
  info-pgp-request@lucpul.it.luc.edu.

  From the RIPEM FAQ by Marc VanHeyningen
  <mvanheyn@whale.cs.indiana.edu> on news.answers:

  > RIPEM is a program which performs Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM)
  > using the cryptographic techniques of RSA and DES.  It allows
  > your electronic mail to have the properties of authentication
  > (i.e. who sent it can be confirmed) and privacy (i.e. nobody can
  > read it except the intended recipient.)
  > 
  > RIPEM was written primarily by Mark Riordan
  > <mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu>. Most of the code is in the public domain,
  > except for the RSA routines, which are a library called RSAREF
  > licensed from RSA Data Security Inc.
  > 
  > RIPEM is available via anonymous FTP to citizens and permanent
  > residents in the U.S. from rsa.com; cd to rsaref/ and read the
  > README file for info.
  > 
  > RIPEM, as well as some other crypt stuff, has its `home site' on
  > rpub.cl.msu.edu, which is open to non-anonymous FTP for users in
  > the U.S. and Canada who are citizens or permanent residents.  To
  > find out how to obtain access, ftp there, cd to pub/crypt/, and
  > read the file GETTING_ACCESS.

  Note: cryptography is generally not well integrated into email yet
  and some system proficiency is required by users to utilize it.

<6.3> What is the cypherpunks mailing list?

  Eric Hughes <hughes@toad.com> runs the `cypherpunk' mailing list
  dedicated to ``discussion about technological defenses for privacy
  in the digital domain.''  Frequent topics include voice and data 
  encryption, anonymous remailers, the Clipper chip.  Send email to
  cypherpunks-request@toad.com to be added or subtracted from the
  list. (Traffic is sometimes up to 30-40 messages per day.)  

  From `Wrestling Over the Key to the Codes', by John Markoff, 
  New York Times, Sun. May 9 1993:
  
  > In the obscure world of computer cryptography, there may be no
  > more self-consciously ornery group of coders than the

  From the charter on soda.berkely.edu:/pub/cypherpunks:

  > The most important means to the defense of privacy is encryption.
  > To encrypt is to indicate the desire for privacy.  But to encrypt
  > with weak cryptography is to indicate not too much desire for
  > privacy. Cypherpunks hope that all people desiring privacy will
  > learn how best to defend it.

<6.7> How can I run an anonymous remailer?

  Cypherpunk remailer source is at soda.berkeley.edu in the
  /pub/cypherpunks directory.  It's written in PERL, and is
  relatively easy to install (no administrative rights are required)
  although basic familiarity with UNIX is necessary. Karl Barrus 
  <elee9sf@menudo.uh.edu> has more information and modifications.
  Also, most remailer operators mentioned above are amenable to
  discussing features, problems, and helping new sites become
  operational. Address all points in the section ``responsibities of
  anonymous use'' in this document prior to advertising your service.
  You should be committed to the long-term stability of the site and
  avoid running one surreptitiously.

<7.1> What is ``digital cash''?

  With digital encryption and authentication technologies, the
  possibility of a widespread digital cash system may someday be
  realized.  A system utilizing codes sent between users and banks
  (similar to today's checking system except entirely digital) may
  be one approach.  The issues of cryptography, privacy, and
  anonymity are closely associated with transfer of cash in an
  economy.  See the article in Scientific American by David Chaum
  (~Dec.1992).

  An experimental digital bank is run by Karl Barrus
  <elee9sf@Menudo.UH.EDU> based on suggestions by Hal Finney on the
  cypherpunks mailing list.  To use the server send mail to
  elee7h5@rosebud.ee.uh.edu message with the following text:

    ::
    command: help
    
    user@host

  where `user@host' is your email address.
 
  
_____
<7.2> What is a ``hacker'' or ``cracker''?

  These terms arouse strong feelings by many on their meaning,
  especially on the internet.  In the general news media in the past
  a person who uses computers and networks to malicious ends (such as
  breaking into systems) has been referred to as a hacker, but most
  internet users prefer the term ``cracker'' for this.  Instead, a
  ``hacker'' is perceived as a benign but intensely ambitious,
  curious, and driven computer user who explores obscure areas of a
  system, for example---something of a proud electronic pioneer and
  patriot.  This is the sense intended in this document.  See also
  the ``Hacker's Dictionary'' and the FAQ `alt-security-faq'.
 
 
_____
<7.3> What is a ``cypherpunk''?

  From the charter of the cypherpunk mailing list:

  > Cypherpunks assume privacy is a good thing and wish there were
  > more of it.  Cypherpunks acknowledge that those who want privacy
  > must create it for themselves and not expect governments,
  > corporations, or other large, faceless organizations to grant
  > them privacy out of beneficence.  Cypherpunks know that people
  > have been creating their own privacy for centuries with whispers,
  > envelopes, closed doors, and couriers.  Cypherpunks do not seek
  > to prevent other people from speaking about their experiences or
  > their opinions.

  From `Wrestling Over the Key to the Codes,'' by J. Markoff in the
  New York Times, Sunday, May 9 1993:

  > In the obscure world of computer cryptography, there may be no
  > more self-consciously ornery group of coders than the Cypherpunks,
  > an alliance of some of Silicon Valley's best programmers and 
  > hardware designers, who preach absolute privacy in the information
  > age.
  >
  > The Cypherpunks, who often communicate among themselves by
  > electronic mail protected with an encryption system popular in
  > the electronic underground, feel certain about one thing: The

_____
<7.4> What is `steganography' and anonymous pools?

  Closely associated with encryption is `steganography' or the
  techniques for not only pursuing private (encrypted) communication
  but concealing the very  existence of the communication itself. 
  Many new possibilities in this area are introduced with the
  proliferation of computer technology.  For example, it is possible
  to encode messages in the least-significant bits of images,
  typically the most 'noisy'. In addition, when such an item is
  posted in a public place (such as a newsgroup), virtually
  untraceable  communication can take place between sender and
  receiver.  For  steganographic communications in the electronic
  realm one another possibility is setting up a mailing list where
  individual messages get broadcast to the entire list and individual
  users decode particular messages with their unique key.   An
  anonymous pool has been set up by Miron Cuperman
  (miron@extropia.wimsey.com) for experiments.  Send email to
  <pool0-request@extropia.wimsey.com>  with one of the following
  commands in the subject line:

    subscribe
    unsubscribe
    help

_____
<7.5> What is `security through obscurity'?

  `Security through obscurity' refers to the attempt to gain
  protection from system weaknesses by hiding sensitive information
  or programs relating to them.  For example, a company may not make
  public information on its software's encryption techniques to evade
  `attacks' based on knowledge of it. Another example would be
  concealing data on the existence of security holes or bugs in
  operating systems.  Or, some reliance may be made on the fact that
  some standard or mechanism with potential problems is serious
  because they are ``not widely known'' or ``not widely used.'' This
  argument is occasionally applied to mechanisms for email and Usenet
  posting `forgery'. `Security through obscurity' is regarded as a
  very feeble  technique at best and inappropriate and ineffective at
  worst (also called the ``head-in-the-sand approach''). See the FAQ
  for alt.security.  
  
  Some remarks of John Perry Barlow, cofounder of the Electronic
  Frontier Foundation, directed to NSA agents at the First
  International Symposium on National Security & National
  Competitiveness held in McLean, Virginia  Dec. 1, 1992:

  > Digitized information is very hard to stamp classified or keep
  > contained. ... This stuff is incredibly leaky and volatile.  It's
  > almost a life form in its ability to self-propagate.  If
  > something hits the Net and it's something which people on there
  > find interesting it will spread like a virus of the mind.  I
  > believe you must simply accept the idea that we are moving into
  > an environment where any information which is at all interesting
  > to people is going to get out.  And there will be very little
  > that you can do about it.  This is not a bad thing in my view,
  > but you may differ...

_____
<7.6> What are `identity daemons'?
  
  Ident Protocol
  --------------

  The RFC 1413 `Identification Protocol' standard (obsoletes RFC-931) 
  describes a protocol standard that allows UNIX programs to query a 
  remote user's login name after connection to a local communication 
  socket (a connection of this type is established during FTP and 
  TELNET sessions, for example).  The standard is not uniformly 
  supported, about 200 sites and domains currently implement it but 
  the number is increasing (the most common implementation `pidentd'
  has reportedly been ported to over a dozen UNIX variants).  
  Under an optional `HIDDEN-USER' function the user may be able to 
  disable it individually but this capability is not guaranteed.

  The protocol is detrimental to anonymity but as a voluntary 
  standard system adminstrators can decide not to install it.  This 
  standard may represent a trend toward greater authentication 
  mechanisms (as with user verification in the NNTP news posting
  protocol).  This software can be used to enforce e.g. program usage
  (licensing) restrictions such as databases that restrict access to 
  a particular organization.  The protocol can also be used in some 
  cases (when it is supported) to track down problematic users.

  - An `Ident' server can only inquire about connections from a 
    directly-connecting host.  If a user uses that host as an 
    intermediate link in a chain the protocol cannot trace past the 
    nearest link in the chain.

  - `Ident' must be running on both sides of a connection for the
    receiver's identification request to succeed.

  - Reportedly no systems are currently shipped with the Ident 
    protocol installed.  Installation is voluntary on the part of 
    system administrators.

  - The Ident program can be configured to refuse to return 
    information for particular (groups of) users by the 
    administrator although the conventional implementation returns
    any requested user information by default.

  - Some popular freeware packages and sites are now supporting Ident
    services.  For example, the popular FTP site wuarchive.wustl.edu 
    contains a built-in Ident client and will interact with an 
    existing Ident server on the remote machine.

  To determine whether or not your particular Unix machine is running  
  an Ident server, examine the file /etc/services.  If you find a 
  list entry for port 113, your system is supporting Ident.  The line 
  should look something like `auth    113/tcp'

  An implementation of the Ident protocol and related files are
  available via anonymous FTP from ftp.lysator.liu.se:/pub/ident.

  TCP Wrapper
  -----------
  Wietse Vensema's tcp_wrapper suite is a group of programs that 
  `wraps around' the traditional tcp/ip utilities,  such as finger, 
  telnet, rsh, and ftp.  It allows an admin to make origin-based 
  decisions about network requests.  For example, all `finger' 
  requests could be denied or `telnet' sessions could be restricted 
  to certain remote users or sites.

<7.7> What standards are needed to guard electronic privacy?


  Remailing/Posting
  -----------------
  
  - Stable, secure, protected, officially sanctioned and permitted,
    publicly and privately operated anonymous servers and hubs.
  - Official standards for encryption and anonymity in mail and USENET
    postings.
  - Truly anonymous protocols with source and destination information
    obscured or absent and hidden routing mechanisms (chaining,
    encrypted addresses, etc.)
  - Standards for anonymous email addressing, embedding files, and
    remailer site chaining.
  
  General
  -------
  
  - Recognition of anonymity, cryptography, and related privacy
    shields as legitimate, useful, desirable, and crucial by the
    general public and their governments.
  - Widespread use and implementation of these technologies 
    by systems designers into
    hardware, software, and standards, implemented `securely,'
    `seamlessly,' and `transparently'.
  - General shift of use, dependence, and reliance to means other than
    wiretapping and electronic surveillance by law enforcement
    agencies.
  - Publicity, retraction, and dissolution of laws and government
    agencies opposed to privacy, replaced by structures dedicated to
    strengthening and protecting it.

<8.1> What is the background behind the Internet?
 
  The article ``Internet'' in Fantasy and Science Fiction by Bruce
  Sterling <bruces@well.sf.ca.us> contains general and nontechnical
  introductory notes on origins of the Internet, including the role
  of the RAND corporation, the goal of network resilience in face of
  nuclear attack, MIT, UCLA, ARPANET, TCP/IP, NSF, NREN, etc.:

  > ARPANET itself formally expired in 1989, a happy victim of its 
  > own overwhelming success.  Its users scarcely noticed, for
  > ARPANET's functions not only continued but steadily improved. 
  > The use of TCP/IP standards for computer networking is now
  > global.  In 1971, a mere twenty-one years ago, there were only
  > four nodes in the ARPANET  network.  Today there are tens of
  > thousands of nodes in the Internet, scattered over forty-two
  > countries, with more coming on-line every day.  Three million,
  > possibly four million people use this gigantic
  > mother-of-all-computer-networks.   
  > 
  > The Internet is especially popular among scientists, and is 
  > probably the most important scientific instrument of the late 
  > twentieth century.  The powerful, sophisticated access that it 
  > provides to specialized data and personal communication has sped
  > up the pace of scientific research enormously.  
  > 
  > The Internet's pace of growth in the early 1990s is spectacular, 
  > almost ferocious.  It is spreading faster than cellular phones,
  > faster than fax machines.  Last year the Internet was growing at
  > a rate of twenty percent a *month.*  The number of `host'
  > machines with direct connection to TCP/IP has been doubling
  > every year since 1988.  The Internet is moving out of its
  > original base in military and research institutions, into
  > elementary and high schools, as well as into public libraries
  > and the commercial sector.

  Internet (NSFNet) statistics are available via anonymous ftp to

<8.2> How is Internet `anarchy' like the English language?

  According to Bruce Sterling <bruces@well.sf.ca.us>:

  > The Internet's `anarchy' may seem strange or even unnatural,  but
  > it makes a certain deep and basic sense.  It's rather like the 
  > `anarchy' of the English language.  Nobody rents English, and
  > nobody owns English.  As an English-speaking person, it's up
  > to you to learn how to speak English properly and make whatever
  > use you please of it (though the government provides certain
  > subsidies to help you learn to read and write a bit).  
  > Otherwise, everybody just sort of pitches in, and somehow the
  > thing evolves on its own, and somehow turns out workable.  And
  > interesting.  Fascinating, even.  Though a lot of people earn
  > their living from using and exploiting and teaching  English,
  > `English' as an institution is public property, a public good.  
  > Much the same goes for the Internet.  Would English  be improved
  > if the `The English Language, Inc.' had a board of directors
  > and a chief executive officer, or a President and a Congress?  
  > There'd probably be a lot fewer new words in English, and a lot
  > fewer new ideas.

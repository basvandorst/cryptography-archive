I was one of the people that suggest that (and still do) and I dont
feel I am making a fool of myself for admitting it.  Why?  There
are other hashing algorithms out there.  I have long been in favor
of moving from crypt(3) to a better hashing function.  I believe
that whatever hashing function is chosen, it should be computationally
adjustable,  when technology advances, the computational complexity
*of the algorithm* (not the implementation) should be adjusted up
to keep the ease of cracking down.

you wont see any apologies from me.

protecting password files by the security of the file system lends
a false sense of security.  Password file security has been breached
many times in the past, and it will continue to be breached.

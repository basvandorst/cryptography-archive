   With all this talk about secure voice communications, the consensus seems
to be that building a portable secure phone that uses standard lines is
difficult, and that it will almost certainly be a costly product, regardless
of who builds it.  I've been considering a much lower cost substitute--a very
cheap, portable machine to provide secure text communication across a phone
line.  This would basically be a palmtop with a DES chip and a modem, and
maybe connections for acoustic couplers so that it can be easily used on
payphones.  You establish a session with someone, use a relatively slow
internal processor to exchange session keys, and then run text encryption and
"talk" by typing.  I wonder if there'd be a market for this sort of thing....

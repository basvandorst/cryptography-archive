That's right.  Consider what happens when Joe Banana of the Republic
of Cyberspace starts using pgp to talk to his embassy in Washington -
for years the NSA has been listening to his traffic and using it to
create reports for the President.  Now the Prez's foreign policy
information from the NSA starts to dry up, and the NSA gets *seriously*
worried about their budget being trashed.  (*That*'s what's behind all
this - big corporation power-politics, not some Orwellian desire to
snoop on private individuals - the latter is just fall-out in the
NSA's attempt to justify its own existence.)

What's worse, President Banana - when he has something *important*
to send - gets some student kid on the net to doubly-encypher it
and pass it along to another student in a US university.  Now its not
even obvious that mega-secret stuff is being distributed, so the NSA
don't know when they could usefully be concentrating *other* means on
capturing the transmissions (like sending a detect van round to the
street where the stuff is typed, if it's that important)

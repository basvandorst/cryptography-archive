I believe it's possible to detect when a tape recorder is recording. I
assume this is by means of the ultrasonic bias signal that is mixed with
the audio. The recording head acts as a transmitting antenna.
The feds have equipment that can detect this radiated energy.

However, you can wrap the microcorder in a few turns of Al foil that will
attenuate the signal. Leave a small opening for the microphone, otherwise
the foil will also attenuate the sound being recorded.

If the above is invalid, please let us know here.

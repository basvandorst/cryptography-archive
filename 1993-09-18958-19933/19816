OK, on my Sun system running OpenWindows, I can double click on the xclock
program and have a window appear on my display with the current time.  I can
also double click on this message and have a window appear on my display with
Cliff's incorrect thoughts on the matter.

So, Cliffy boy, what about micro-code?  What about the pseudo-Forth code
in the ROMs on the S-bus cards in by SPARCstation (used to achive CPU
independence of the expansion cards, unlike, say, microchannel or ISA)?

When you execute, say, an EXE file on a PC, it is not directly executable;
it needs to be loaded into memory and the relocatable addresses resolved.
When you execute a COM file on your PC, the instructions still are interpreted
by the micro-code in your 80x86 chip.  When you execute a BAT file, the
instructions are interpreted by the COMMAND.COM program.  All of these are
just a code, and the only way you can use them are through the use of a
combination of hardware, firmware, and software, that could "decode" that code
and turn it into something understandable my you.  EXE/COM/BAT is as much a
code as the Masonic code, or the stick men in the Sherlock Holmes mystery;
they are just the only code that many computers can do much of anything with.

This discussion has been reduced to picking technical nits, when the
two of you agree on the issues behind the whole conversation (whether
speech that happens to be source code, or machine instructions, or
whatever you want to call it, is protected speech).  However, the
distinctions being made are so totally pointless that I have to point
out a few things.

In article <2499@indep1.uucp>, Cliff Sharp <clifto@indep1.UUCP> wrote:

I don't understand why the machine language of a CPU is any more
"machine instructions" than source code or an ASCII string.  Who *cares*
what exact piece of hardware inside this box on my desk is actually
"executing" the exact ones and zeros?   By your definition, the only
true machine instructions (the things that get directly executed
by hardware) on my machine are the microcoded instructions within the
CPU, so not even the machine language for the CPU are true "machine
instructions".  Therefore *nothing* that I can insert in my machine are machine
instructions, and yet, somehow, they instruct the machine in what to
do.   Similarly, the contention that a LISP machine doesn't execute LISP is just
as pointless --- *of course* a LISP machine executes LISP.  What
goes on inside the box to get the LISP executed is irrelevant.  The
machine that I'm instructing is the LISP machine, *NOT* the CPU inside
the box....

Believe it or not, Brian, I fully agree with you.  The marginal utility of
fighting city hall for most people and at most times is not worth the
trouble.  Certainly one ought not to expect appreciation, wealth, fame but
rather tedium, banality, and expense -- if not even fear and punishment.

But like a confluence of ripples, sometimes a group or individual can rise
to the challenge.  How else does one repay the sacrifice individuals have made
before our time?  The same way _they_ repaid the debt. The baton of freedom that
was given to us by those who lived before has to be, at times, passed on
with a firm blow.

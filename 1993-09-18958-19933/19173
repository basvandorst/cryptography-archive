   I cracked the encryption in FastBack 3.1 similarly.  After a while of
debugging through it, I found the routine (called a zillion times during
use of the program) that did password verification and changed it to a
couple of simple lines of code that always returned a zero.
   Many many years ago, I tried my hand at the first commercial "unbypassable"
copy protection scheme on the market.  It took longer to type the debugger
commands than it did to bypass the first ten obstacles to use of the program,
and I got bored with the whole thing and never bothered to continue.

   Granted, but it does deter it to some extent, mostly for those who
don't have computer-literate friends or frequent BBSes.

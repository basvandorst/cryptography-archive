I've never seen a formal, technical definition for an 'explosion.'
If anyone has, I'd really appreciate hearing one.

My understanding is that anything that involves a rapid release
of pressure could correctly be called an explosion.  So, all of
the following would count:
	- a steam filled vessel rupturing (no combustion involved here!)
	- a balloon popping (weak, but nonetheless legitimate)
	- black powder burning in an enclosed pressure vessel,
	  rupturing when the limits of the vessel are exceeded.
	  The explosion happens when the vessel bursts; if it doesn't
	  burst, there's no explosion.
	- a high explosive _detonating_, be it confined or not.

So, no chemical reactions or high temperatures are necessary,
for something to be called an explosion (as far as I can figure).
Rather, a rapid release of pressure by any means should fit.

In one the book I have read, a distinction is made between
deflagration and burning.  Both are subsonic processes (and
therefore distinct from, and much slower than, detonation), but
deflagration is faster than burning.  This differentiation was
made in the context of a flame front propogating through a
flammable gas gas.  I'll try and look it up this weekend.

I once ignited a quantity of methanol 'snow', floating in liquid
oxygen.  It went 'bang' - so I called it an explosion.  Several
year later, I asked my gasdynamics prof about this - he said
that it didn't detonate, basing his conclusion on the quantities
involved, and the fact that I was still alive.  Shudder.
His opinion was that this mixture deflagrated, producing a large
volume of high pressure gas very quickly.  This made the
'boom' (explosion), even though there was no detonation or
confinement involved.

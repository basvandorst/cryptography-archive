   It is a minor point, but one that could become important.  The
First Ammendment specifically covers both freedom of speech and of the
press.  So the authors thought it necessary to mention both (as well
as religion).  It is certainly easy to argue that the reason all three
are in the same sentence is that the authors couldn't concieve of a
way of protecting one without equally protecting all three.

   Note that today virtually all printed material is represented in
electronic form at some point during the process of printing it.  Thus
a protection for documents printed from hand set type only would not
be much of a protection.  Since the courts seem to have taken no
judicial notice of the change in the last fifty years from letterpress
to lithography for most publishing, I can't imagine that they would
find the use of xerography (or ink-jets, or magnetic media) any
different.  In fact, you could argue that since the courts have taken
note of the use of phonograph records, magnetic tape and CDs in the
music publishing business, that CD-ROMs are already covered.

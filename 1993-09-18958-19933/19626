It all depends on your viewpoint.  I'd say the encrypted material counted as
documents, and the government is perfectly entitled to them (if they can
find them), but there is nothing which says that the documents have to be in
a form that the government can read.  The key, however, is in the head of
the defendent - the only way to reveal it is if the defendent speaks - I
don't see how anyone could legitimately call the key a `document'.  I'd say
that compelling someone to reveal a key is on a par with compelling them to
reveal where they buried the body - fifth amendment, right to silence and
all that...

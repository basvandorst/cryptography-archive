Extreme man-in-the-middle attacks can probably be dismissed. But
what happens when we have thouands of public keys "out there" with
a dozen or so individuals (and eventually a few nation-state agencies)
releasing false keys? Are the false ones readily identified and 
generally agreed to be false? Or does the system break down into
chaos (not using the mathematical definition here)? What proportion
of honest key-makers to dishonest ones are needed to make the 
system work?

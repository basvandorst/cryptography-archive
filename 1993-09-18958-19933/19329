I don't know about Customs, but a few years back somebody threw out
some radium or something from a hospital irradiation thing-a-ma-jig
which wound up mixed with some scrap steel.  The steel got recast into
legs for dining room tables(!).  A truck carrying said tables passed an
Illinios state trooper who apparently was running a Geiger counter
along with his radar; said Geiger counter freaked when the truck went
by.  Wot happened eventually got figured out, and everyone lived
happily ever after, except the guys now responsible for storing several
gross of dining room table for 4000+ years.

I don't follow this.  Surely if the regs are unconstitutional, they are 
unconstitutional whether I say so or not.

This seems to be saying that all regulations are constitutional until a 
court declares them unconstitutional.  But even if a lower court were to 
declare them unconstitutional, a higher court might reverse the lower 
court.  And if the highest court, the Supreme Court, held the regulations 
unconstitutional they might later overrule that opinion.  And, mutatis 
mutandis, the same is true if the courts were to declare the regulations 
constitutional.

Thus whether or not a court has spoken in the past on the issue one can 
still debate whether or not the regulations are unconstitutional.  The only 
practical way of debating issues of constitutionality is to realize that the 
law is an educated guess made today as to what the courts will decide 
tomorrow.  Or, as Justice Holmes put it, "for legal purposes a right is 
only the hypostasis of a phrophecy".

Tribe does a good job of phrophesying--in part because he does a good job of 
making his prophecies come true in his arguments before the Supreme Court.

But all this is rather besides the point.  It is quite unusual for 
regulations to be declared unconstitutional on their face.  Regulations are 
more often held to be unconstitutional (which means unenforceable because 
they are not consistent with some provision of the constitution) as they 
apply to some particular factual situation, but even that is rare.  The 
standard approach if there is a serious question as to the constitutionality 
of a regulation is to construe the regulation so that the question does not 
arise.

So my prediction is that--if the issue ever gets to the courts--they will 
hold that the ITAR don't require a publisher to get a license before 
publishing cryptographic algorithms, descriptions, or source code.  

But I do not think that the Feds will ever bring the matter to court--there 
is too much danger of an adverse decision if they do (and, anyway, it would 
have to be a U.S. Attorney or someone in the Justice Department who actually 
brought the case, and there is reason to believe that Justice does not 
consider that the ITAR can be constitutionally applied to publications).

So it may be that I (or some other public spirited type that has written an 
encryption program or algorithm or description) will have to bring suit to 
enjoin the enforcement of the ITAR against those who merely write or publish 
such programs or algorithms or descriptions.  That might well be like 
shooting fish in a barrel.  I'm not sure that the Justice Department's 
lawyers would even be willing to defend such a suit; after all, lawyers who 
try to defend the undefendable are subject to sanctions under Rule 11 of the 
Federal Rules.

No one suggests that properly adopted regulations are prima facie 
unconstitutional, but this is not because of the mystique of General 
Counsels.

The State Department doesn't have a General Counsel (though they do have a 
Legal Advisor).  The lawyer who actually represents the people who drafted 
the latest version of the ITAR is a member of the Legal Advisor's office; my 
impression is that she is quite a junior member.  She certainly does not 
seem to know much about contitutional (or any other sort of) litigation.  
This is not surprising since the Legal Advisor's office does not litigate; 
their expertise is in international law.

This may give you a warm feeling in the pit of your stomach, but would not
only be totally ineffective, but bad timing.

The best outcome is if, given the testimony, the grand jury refuses to
indict. The President and Congress won't interfere with the Grand Jury
process, which is one in which the Grand Jury, made up of citizens, decides
if there is enough cause to indict.

The greatest ammunition at this point is in the testimony those subpeonaed
give before the grand jury. They are certainly able to make a well-prepared
set of representations about their actions, motives, and beliefs.

Not only does the state have to establish the facts of a felony, but also
intent. If they can, the case goes to trial. If they can't it's all over.
Since this is a Federal case, I think they only get one shot at the Grand
Jury, though I could be wrong. I am not an attorney and this message
reflects a layman's imperfect understanding of such things. It is certainly
not legal advice.

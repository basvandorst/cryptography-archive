   When I went through the ITAR games a number of years back, it was
clear that the rules as established allow Grady (as a US citizen) an
unlimited--and unlimitable--right to distribute his own work, but
there is no protection for export of material written by non-US
citizens.  (In particular, a corporation has no such license, only
individual citizens.)  I think that this is clearly unconstitutional.

   There is a doctrine that there is a chilling effect on protected
speech from having to determine whether or not a work is, in fact,
protected speech.  This has been used to stike down many similar laws
in this area in the past.  In this case especially, where Grady's
original work is a compilation of protected and (putatively)
unproctected speech, issues of authorship should not be allow to
infringe his ability to "utter" that speech.  (Copyright is a civil
and not a criminal issue.)  Does a political speech become unprotected
if I quote Karl Marx?  I don't think so.

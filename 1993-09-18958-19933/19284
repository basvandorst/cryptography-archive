There have been a number of electronic cash systems proposed (look in
Crypto or Eurocrypt proceedings for articles by David Chaum and, more
recently, Neils Furgesen or S. Brands).  They are secure in that neither
the bank or either party involved in the transaction can cheat, and the
anonymity of the parties are ensured.  The banks are still involved, and
can still take a transaction fee, though.

There's a good summary article in Oct 92 Scientific American, or you can
wait another two months for my book, Applied Cryptography.

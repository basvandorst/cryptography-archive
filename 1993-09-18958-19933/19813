The prohibition on communications with amateurs in other countries derives from
ITU treaty, which the FCC abides by.

There have been at least two actions taken under the ITU agreement since WWI.
The first was the cessation of amateur radio during WWII, from a few days 
after Pearl Harbor to a few months after VJ Day.  The second (that I know of)
was a prohibition against contacts with North Viet Nam during the Viet Nam
War.

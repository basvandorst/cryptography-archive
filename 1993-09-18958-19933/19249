Opps - brainfart alert.

A few days ago I posted a message speculating that this method could
confirm secret keys over an insecure channel.

It was that the first party create a random mask, xors it with the key,
send the result over the insecure channel, the other party xors it with
THEIR key and sends it back.

If it's the original mask than the keys must match.

Well, I'm sitting here doing something else when it suddenly pops into
my head that the eavesdropper merely has to record both transmissions,
xor them together and he's got the key!

Sorry about this.

Embodiment, approach and attitude.

-or as you seem to like analogies-

"It" looks like a duck, acts like a duck, has the essential features of a
duck and quacks like a duck.
Summary: Duck season  *will* be hazardous to  "it's"health.

How about selling tanks(or M-16 parts), without the key,  to terrorist
organizations.  "But your honor, It wasn't really a tank (Full auto M-16)
because it wasn't a complete tank.  I didn't sell them the key (bayonet
lug)".  

Anyone "reasonably skilled in the art", and many kids, can compile said 
in seconds into executables (make a key, attach a bayonet lug).

Eloquent quotes or amusing analogies have little forebarance in "getting
the process started".  (It's been started for some time now) 

A  more exact analogy is speeding.  Speed limits are not raised by
driving 80 in a 55, re-painting the sign or "mono-digitally" signalling
traffic control officers.  The consequences for those activities are well
substantiated.    Dialog via petition or direct communication with
legislative and executive bodies is appropriate and effective.    Don't
like the result, go on the offensive and take a plantiff's position.

  Don't like something, work the issue. "The process" works for those who
take the time.

An error on my part with an imperfect example.  Maybe the registration
of handguns is more appropriate (especially since the right to bear
arms is another constitutionally protected right).  In many places
registration is required, but rarely denied (felons, children, ...).

If this example is less than perfect please consider the main point of
my statement on its own merits.

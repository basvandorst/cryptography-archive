This is the W54 Atomic Demoliton Munition with a yield of 1 kt.  It is
still in current service.  This weapon would actually have a number of
uses such as destroying a damn, tunnel or similar structure with 
one shot or bringing down the walls of a mountain pass onto a highway.

Following is a table listing all current  and past US weapons.  It should
answer all similar questions and will lay some of these wild rumors
(50 MT indeed!) to rest.  Note that most of these weapons, particularly
the cruise missile ones and the MIRV components are easily 
"pickup truck portable."

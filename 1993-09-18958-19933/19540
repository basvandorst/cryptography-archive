As Dan Bernstein posted to talk.politics.crypto a few days ago,
discussing these regulations:

As was discussed earlier, this form of selective enforcement is common.
It would be interesting to see whether it is legal.

If the government will argue that it is simply enforcing the laws to the
best of its ability as it learns of new crypto manufacturers, I wonder what
would happen if the government were to receive a list of crypto and
other munitions manufacturers.  If this forced equal-handed enforcement of the
regulations, it might well increase political pressure against these laws.

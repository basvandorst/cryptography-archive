Because the logistics of moving around a OTP of sufficient size would be a
security nightmare: you would have to provide for the physical security of
each and every copy of each and every pad at each and every step along the
way.  Too, a OTP _must_ be larger than the largest message to be used with
it, so must necessarily be pretty sizable, another impediment to being
easily moved around.  Finally, a One Time Pad is just that: a _one time_
pad - use it once, throw it away (figuratively speaking) - so you would
need a separate pad for _every message_ you planned to send with it.

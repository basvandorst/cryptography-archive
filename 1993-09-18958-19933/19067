Oh, come on.  For a lot of major software packages we
workstation/network users have floating license servers that are
essentially the same thing.  They're a little cruder -- you have to
guess your level of usage when you order the licenses, but they
allow you to do a crude approximation of usage-based charges.

My own guess is that in a few years most of the major packages will
have true usage-based charging, but via network authentication, rather
than the proposed smartcards.  You might have a local copy of the source
or you might get it over the net as you use it, depending on the
bandwidth between you and the licensor.  The package runs on your system
and periodically (the period would depend on the granularity of the
license for the individual package) makes contact with the license
server for revalidation.  Your account gets charged for the number of
time units you actually use.  Rates probably include quantity discounts
and probably have a maximum per-user monthly fee.  A large company might
negotiate a flat-rate unlimited license.

The model is that the software becomes a service, rather than a
purchased product.  There are significant benefits for both vendor and
user as well as some potential drawbacks.  I think it's inevitable.

Why should one have to register with the government in order to excersize
one's Constitutionally-guaranteed right to free speech?  The First Amendment
does not mention any exception for speech about cryptography--nor for anything
else, for that matter.  The language is very absolute.  Congress is forbidden
from making any laws that abridge (limit, curtail, restrict) the freedom to 
speak whatever one wishes. No exceptions are granted.  Those are the facts.
 
The Supreme Court that lets people burn American flags, publish details of
the design of thermonuclear bombs and march in white robes and pointy hats
down main street--all in the name of the First Amendment--is not likely to 
approve of laws requiring people to keep secrets that are 1) discovered by 
private individuals without government funds; and 2) already widely known 
world wide.

In the worst case, only.  Would you have a problem even begining work on
breaking clipper?

Not so.  Even huge agencies have budgets.  They can not look at everything.

I think the more important point is, say you switch between 16 different 
systems.  This only adds four bits to the key, and also means that you 
have to examine 16 different systems!  Plus, if one of them is realy stupid,
you have shot yourself in the foot by using it.

Yes, it would provide absolutily no security, just obscurity.  Why is this 
bad?  The search algorithim for "BEGIN SECRET STUFF" is much smaller and 
cheeper than the algorithim to distinguish ASCI psudo-code made to have
even a slight resembalance to english text.

>All the issues you've mentioned are irrelevant to real security.
It seems to me that the issues are relevant to real world security, but
not to ideal security.  Ideal security is nice, and incredibly powefull,
and usefull, but is not everything.  

I realise this is SCI.CRYPT and most people in scientific cryptology concern
themselves with the much harder problem of ideal security, but maby there 
should be a field of engineering.crypt:) to deal with this stuff.

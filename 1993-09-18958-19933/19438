   When making a recording of a conversation, the only requirement is that at
   least one party has knowledge the recording is being made.  Seeing as how
   he is the one making the recording, he has met this reqiurement.

That may depend on the jurisdiction, and it may differ for phone and
in person, and may differ for concealed recorders.
And even if they're trying to get you on federal issues, that doesn't
mean they won't stoop to using a local law to bust you for *something*
so you'll look guilty when they're trying to paint you as a crypto-terrorist
about to give the Seecret Plans to the Commies....  (They may have to 
import a Commie from Berkeley to make up for the lack of real Commies.)

An acquaintance of mine was the mayor of his town, and was having to
deal with the NJ state environmental bureaucrats about whether his
town would be able to use their existing wells or buy water from the
conglomerate that's been taking over the local water businesses.
Some previous conversations had included hints that for a bribe, 
the bureaucrats would let him do what he wanted.  His wife came along
with him on one of his trips to Trenton - she looked like she was just
waiting for him to do his business, but in fact she was there acting
as one of the two parties knowing and consenting to the recording.
Don't know if this was really legally required or not, though.

I believe this to be a classical Sammy D. statistical blunder (o.k., o.k.,
lets stop this stuff now).

The argument being made was a general one, and thus wrong.

If the adversary is using a deterministic search process;
If the adversary has only "ordinary computing resources"
His search can take several weeks.

If you change the password about twice as often, then at any point in his
search

If he hasn't yet hit your password

You have a significant chance that your new password is in the solution
space already searched and thus won't be found,

and

If you don't change the password, it is in a much smaller solution space
than when the search started, and thus more likely to be found.

Thus the general assertion made that probabilistically speaking it doesn't
matter if you don't change your password is simply false under many
real-world circumstances.

(Note that a reader commented to me that the above wouldn't apply to a
pseudo-random search process. Though this is true, it means you have to make
an assumption about the adversary's search process in order to be secure,
and as the same reader pointed out, one should not rely on assumptions about
an adversary's search process for security.)

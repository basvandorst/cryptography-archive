You could certainly build an encrypting file system that gave
reasonable speed and security on a 486/25.  Triple DES would
probably tax your patience speed-wise, but other decent algorithms 
would be suitable.

I once started building something like this based on the 
freeware MS-DOS compression TSR DietDisk.  I shelved the
project, but my point is that if you can have a compressing
file system (and there are many of those), you can 
have an encrypting file system.  There are even a few obscure
commercial products that do this.  See the ads in "Infosecurity
News", for instance.

This document discusses in detail many aspects of current cryptography,
whether theoretical, practical, legal or commercial. It is a broad guide to
the state of cryptography today, and includes both introductory and advanced
topics. Although not a technical document, this FAQ gives extensive 
bibliographic references to the technical literature for all major areas
of cryptography. The FAQ will be continually edited to reflect new
developments.

`Frequently Asked Questions' is available via anonymous ftp from rsa.com,
in the pub/faq directory. It is available in ascii, postscript and LaTeX
formats. Those without ftp capability can obtain a hard copy by sending
$20 (to cover expenses) to RSA Laboratories, 100 Marine Parkway,
Redwood City, CA  94065.

Any questions or comments may be sent to faq-editor@rsa.com.

Here is a list of questions answered.

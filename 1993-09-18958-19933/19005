since you brought it up, do any such forged keys in fact exist?
has anybody out there ever found evidence that there were keys made
in their name?  this is supposed to be the achille's heel of
public key systems, but to actuallyy forge a key, for , say
staticrn@burnflag.ati.com, publish it in a key server, and then intercept
all encrypted email to him/her, etc, etc, and keep  staticrn from finding out
would be pretty difficult.

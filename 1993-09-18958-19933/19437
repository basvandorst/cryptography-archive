Another thing that might help:

Recently the Boston Globe seems to have taken an interests in the 
net, (not the typical deranged computer geeks trying to pick up
innocent little kids stories). I think there e-mail address for
letters is letters@globe.com, maybe they could be convinced to
do a thing on it?

For the person saying that writting to the president is Naive:

 What do you think the purpose of a democracy is? 
 President Clinton is not a king, he is an elected official,
 if people disagree with the policies of the government it is
 there right to complain. And any elected official who cares
 about being reelected is going to listen when they start
 getting alot of letters.

(this is why the religious right with its TV networks has tremendous
 political power)

I would certainly like to believe that that's the case. But Mike
Godwin (mnemonic@eff.org) argues that under existing case law, the 5th
amendment would not necessarily protect you from being forced to
divulge an encryption key.

I believe his reasoning is based on the assumption that a crypto key
would not necessarily be considered "testimonial".  I don't understand
why it wouldn't be, but he's a lawyer and I'm not. I would love to see
the two of you debate the issue for the rest of us.  It's quite
disconcerting to see completely opposite opinions from two lawyers who
are both supposedly on the same side...

an alternative is to use a second-order homophonic substitution, such
as the one described on p. 72 of denning's text.  here, the message is
encrypted in such a way that there are two (or more, for higher order
substitutions) equally likely meaningful plaintexts.

the advantage over one-time pad is the much shorter key length.  of 
course, you'd want to use a strong cipher on the resulting ciphertext.

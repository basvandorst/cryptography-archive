I have been foloowing this thread and would like to add my two cents 
worth:

[stepping on soapbox]
I've worked with the (and some would sometimes say "against") the
federal government for over ten years including many experiences 
with the NSA.  My policy now boils down to one of brutal practicallity.
Say what you will about what is right, this court decision or that court
decision, etc. - will you win? Can you manipulate, use or oppose the 
bureacracy in such a fashion as to achive your objectives?  If not, save
yourself a lot of time, effort and frustration and pack it in now.  There
are plenty of other profitable, rewarding and fun uses for my time.
Sorry if that sounds like sell-out material but I have seen many of my 
colleagues get really beat up in obsessive battles against a "big brother" who 
had/has so many more resources it just isn't funny.  In the end, they lost not
because they didn't get their product approved, exported, etc. but because
not moving on wrecked their lives.

This is surprisingly slow for hardware. In the most recent IEEE Conf.
on Comp. Arith. a paper [1] described an implementation of RSA using FPGAs, with
performance of 600Kbits/sec. for 512 bit keys. Since FPGAs are slower than
snail snot in January, most of this impressive speed is due to clever
algorithms.  For pure software implementations, the author cited 30ms/block
on a R3000, and 9ms/block on a DEC alpha using the same algorithms for
1024 bit keys.

Agreed, regular changing of passwords helps not at all against a
password-guessing attack.  Its main benefit is to thwart those who
already have your password.  I guess what you must assess is the
likelihood of this happening.

Did I see your password over your shoulder last night?  Quite possible
in a crowded lab.

Did I snarf it via some form of tty-spoofing?  Quite possible on many
networked systems (for a primer on this technique see Phrack 41, file
8).

Or perhaps I got it from some data-tapping device, ethernet sniffer,
or keyboard buffering program.  Many labs use PC's & Macs as
terminals.  Did you check yours for odd programs running in the
background? 

If you feel your environment is secure enough to ignore these (&
other) threats, keep your password as long as you wish.  But don't
assume that just because you didn't see me looking over your shoulder
that I wasn't there.

ps - for the hypersensitive reader, the "I" above is a literary device
not an admission of guilt nor an indication of anything else.  Sheesh.

I said no such thing. I said they said you had to register as a manufacturer
of defense articles if you made them, which is what State said. Several
here have been misrepresenting what State said, to mean you have to register
as an International Arms Dealer.  That is not what they said. You only have
to register as an international arms dealer if you export or import stuff on
the control list.

|Criminal law is far from my strong suit (ask me about the Administrative

This is dependent on local laws, however.  In Michigan, the Attorney General
attempted to set up a road block of the nature you describe.  It ran
for one night before the ACLU challenged the legality of it.  The US
Supreme Court ruled that such activities do not violate the US Constitution,
but the Michigan Supreme Court ruled that it did violate more specific
protections in the state constitution.  

So, as always, ... your mileage may vary.  Especially if the roadblocks
keep slowing you down.  :-)

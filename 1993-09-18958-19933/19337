Very well said!

Thank you Rahul for stating this case. You have precisely captured my
thoughts on this subject, and expressed my feelings on this importnat issue
better than I myself could have. I image that many of us hold these
opinions, and I can't help but think that those who urge taking such topics
to email are sticking their head in the sand.

This network has the potential to be the greatest boon to democracy in the
history of the world, but not if we insist that it be "sanitary" like TV.

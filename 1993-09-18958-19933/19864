This is not a practical attack since, by your description, the size of the
key space is not reduced with each attempt. Exhaustive searches do just 
that, "exhaust" the key space until they find the answer.

This does not work on a truly "exhaustive" search, since an exhaustive search
will "eventually" find the right password if it is not changed. If it is
changed, there is a large chance that an exhaustive search will not find
the password.

What if an intruder is recording your sessions? Changing your key occasionally
forces them to brute force each different piece.

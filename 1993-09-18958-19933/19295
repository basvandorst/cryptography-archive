I agree of course.  Note that 'Moby Crypto' is source code only
(just the algorithms) and not executables.  That is, I am just
like the FIPS DES document except I happen to distribute with
magnetic domains rather than paper.

Even the Supreme Court now thinks that computer media is important
to the democratic process.  Beginning this year all decisions are
being distributed in electronic form in addition to the traditional
printed form.  And of course it was recently decided that White
House electronic memoranda must be treated in the same way as
printed memoranda as an important permanent archive of our government.

As long as PGP never enters the US, export laws don't apply.  But once it
does, the origin doesn't matter.  An example of how the law works:

A few years ago, as relations were starting to improve, the USSR loaned a
nuclear reactor to the US for study.  The US government wouldn't let them
have it back because it was illegal to export such a reactor to the USSR.
(Eventually high level intervention unblocked the return, but that is not
an option for PGP.)

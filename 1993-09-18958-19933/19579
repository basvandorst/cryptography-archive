In the 9/13/93 "Communications Week", pp. 41 and 44, appears an
article entitled "New Wireless Gear Will Be More Secure". The article
reports that the emerging Cellular Digital Packet Data (CDPD) standard
will use Diffie-Hellman for authentication with a 256 bit key size,
and RC2/RC4 for encryption. The article notes that these algorithms
can't be exported outside the U.S. (I think it should say US and
Canada.).

If that's the case, then, why not use a larger key size and
triple-DES, or are we getting into more expensive silicon/too much
memory?

Comments? Thanks!

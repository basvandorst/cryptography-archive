Hello,

I'm an EE (working full time on software, mostly C and C++) and am
looking for advice on good introductory books on cryptography.

Suggestions I've received are...

  Cryptography and Data Security by Denning
    and
  Mathematical Cryptology by W. Patterson.

Are these good?  Should I be looking at any others?

Thanks!

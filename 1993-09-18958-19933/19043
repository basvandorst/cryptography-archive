Actually, almost every RF receiver made these days uses superheterodyne
detectors, which work by generating a signal a fixed distance away from
the desired carrier and listening for the beat (ie interference) which
contains the (relatively) low frequency audio and video signals.

As I recall, the BBC in England uses this technique to find people
who own unlicenced TVs and radios.  (BBC gets a usage tax to fund
their broadcasts.  In the USA, PBS is always envious of this.)  The
frequency cops just drive a van through your neighborhood and never
have to get out or even stop.

You can tell what channel a TV is tuned to by aiming a directional
antenna at the set and checking the frequency of the superheterodyne
signal.  If you are watching a non-broadcast station, you better have
a legal cable decoder.

I just had my attention drawn to an ad for voice encryption software
for PC's (requires 80386-20 or better, soundblaster, V.42bis modem) that
uses up to triple-and-a-half-DES (if you have a fast enough machine.)
Does anyone know if something similar is available for Macintosh's?
(The new av's with built-in digital signal processors oughta be a 
breeze at it.)

"Immoral" is, indeed, an important concept, as is "the spirit of the
framers."  But we already have words or phrases for those concepts;
there is no contribution to them in taking some other word, such as
"unconstitutional," and stretching it to mean what they already say
clearly.  

Conversely, "unconstitutional" does mean "violating the law itself";
it is a legal term.  It, too, receives only harm by being stretched to
meanings it does not carry - it becomes less forceful by dilution,
more widely applicable, but by that very token, carries less meaning.

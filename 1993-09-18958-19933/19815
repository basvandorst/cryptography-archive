More than several people have asked about general books
on the subject of cryptography. One of the latest ones
will emerge in November. It's pretty current. I've read
earlier versions of the book and I think many people
will find it easy to learn the subject by reading the book.
It goes into great depth and covers plenty of the latest
material. It also comes with runnable code that might
make many lives easier.

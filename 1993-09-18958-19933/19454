And you think that he comes in to the Oval Office every morning at 8am
and opens his US mail?  I'll bet that in both cases, the mail is
archived, counted for and against the particular position, and then
the administration decides what to do.  The only difference is that it
costs more people more time to handle physical mail, and therefore
costs more of our tax dollars to do so.

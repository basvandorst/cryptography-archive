        Suppose I'm disconnected from the network.

        Suppose I'm using a GUI desktop and this is only one of a
        dozen things active, including others using a timed usage
        charge.

        Suppose I do some differential analysis to figure out how to
        reset the timers.

        Suppose Borland comes out with a competitive product and a
        one-time price of $50.

        Cheers,
                Marc

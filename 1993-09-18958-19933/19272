I was wondering if anyone has done any work on developing a 
system of "electronic cash".  Currently, if I wish to send someone some
money, I have to tell my bank to give some money to
the bank of the person who is going to get the money.

This means that both banks will end up getting a cut of the transaction.
I.e.  a transaction fee.

Is there anyway to do this?  You might need the National Bank of 
each country to issue some form of "electronic certificates"  much
like they currently print paper money.

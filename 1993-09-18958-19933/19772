I would be interested in knowing the reasoning behind this.  Did the
publisher's lawyers decide that a source code disk would not be covered
under the First Amendement?  (I presume, "Yes.")  Did they explain
their reasoning, or give any precedents that would make them believe
that this was so?  Or did the publisher just want an excuse to not go
to the trouble of including a diskette?

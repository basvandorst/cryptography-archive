You're vaguely remembering, backward, a case whose holding has been superceded
by Congress - and which didn't way quite what you think it said to begin with.

I don't have the details handy either, it went something like this:  Supplier
licensed User U the rights to use some software for a long period of time.
U came to be quite dependent on the software.

Then S went bankrupt, and entered reorganization under Chapter 11.  The
bankruptcy receiver determined that it was in the best interests of S's
recovery that it cancel all its existing licensing agreements.  This left
U in the lurch, as it relied on the code to keep its business running.  Absent
the bankruptcy, S's contract with U did not allow for cancelation; however,
the courts held that the bankruptcy laws, then fairly recently amended, did
in fact allow the receiver to abrogate a license agreement.

Software escrow was already used to make source code and such available in the
case of a failure of the supplier.  That wasn't the problem here:  Even if U
could get his hands on the code from the escrow agent (I don't know if there
was one in this particular case), he still couldn't *use* it without the
license, which had been abrogated.

In response to this ruling, lawyers began drafting various kinds of "hands-
off" escrow agreements which would be beyond the reach of the bankrupcy
courts.  The general idea was that, not only would the code be given to the
escrow agent, but the agent would also be given immediate and irrevokable
title to the software - but title that would not allow it to use the software
or give any rights to it to the purchaser unless the supplier entered bank-
ruptcy (or other defined events occured).  This was all a bit of legalese
designed, essentially, to remove any element of choice from the agreement,
since a receiver could use any such element of choice to grab the rights to
the software back.  (A license, even a license that is perpetual by contract,
is still an ongoing agreement and can, under the right conditions, be modified
or retracted.  Once rights are transferred, they are gone.)

I don't know whether such an agreement was ever actually tested in court, but
it soon became irrelevent:  Congress agreed that it was never the intent of
the bankruptcy law to allow a receiver to abrogate continuing licenses, and
they amended the law to make this clear.

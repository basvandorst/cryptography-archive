That letter posted from the State was saying that if you manufacture
anything that is on their list, you have to register.  You said they
were wrong, but nevertheless, they said it.  Who wants to find out if
you are right or them?  Besides, somebody defined exporting as selling
to non citizens based on another regulation, it does not have to be
shipped accross the border.

The question that pops up in my mind is the following.  I am thinking
about implementing some crypto methods in my programs to prevent
modification of the executable and notice text in the image, as well as
the serial number and license information for virus protection,
modification protection, and licensing control as well.  Will I have to
be an arms dealer for employing crypto techniques doing this?

(The question is raised for both cases, if I decide to export it or if I
decide not to export it - in terms of shipping it across the border).

If the term of exporting in means of selling to non-citizens within the
US applies, how do I go about verifying citizenship of the end users? 
Will they have to be sworn in not to give it to a non-citizen?

I feel that the questions above are silly, however, I cannot come up
with definite answers other than running the risk to be subject to
prosecution if I don't have answers to those silly questions.

Hi. 

I have been working on a number of crypto implementations on a PC
 (486sx, 20MHz)
Things are working well, but I would like to know if the performance
I am getting is any good.

The numbers:

DES:
C-implementation works at about 10 Kbyte/sec, using a 32KByte keytable.
ASM-version 17Kbyte/sec.


IDEA:
for C its about 43KByte/sec, ASM 129KByte/sec


SHS:
39 KByte/sec in C, 74KByte/sec in ASM


I would like to know the following:

1) How good is the performance ? I have the feeling that things should be
much better, especially for DES. Are there any figures about obtainable
performance ? Any *fast* implementations around ? source ?

2) The DES implementation needs a number of tables that are too large
for the application I am contemplating. Is there any alternative ?
Has anyone had a similar problem ? solutions ?

3) Any information on performance-optimal implementations of
DES, IDEA, MD5 and SHS welcome.


Ill summarize answers.



thanx
NN

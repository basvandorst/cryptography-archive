I read the text of your message. You did say, not imply, that I had called
people fools. Your present lateral arabesque is unpersuasive.

I take it from your repetition of this charge that you are pleading guilty
to a charge I did not make. Guilty conscience?  :-)

But seriously:

It seems pretty straightforward to me. After the Grand Jury has had its
hearing, if they return charges, that's the time for those who object and
wish to be effective to mount a strong campaign with Congress and perhaps
the White House. It should be factual, precise, and dispassionate, making
many of the arguments we've seen here about the Constitution, Civil
Liberties, etc.

But we should wait, I think, at least until we know what they're up to or we
might act in a way that would actually be massively counterproductive.

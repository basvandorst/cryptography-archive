Tim Smith suggests a protocol for game manufacturers to protect games, but,
given the US courts intepretation of the law, it's much simpler than that.
Nintendo does have an encryption interface, which means that games to play
on the Nintendo must conform to this interface. It's easy enough to reverse
engineer the encryption, several companies have done so in the past. However,
Nintendo got a court order putting them out of (that) business -- they have
a patent on the encryption approach, and they argued successfully that the
companies were violating the patents.

Wonderful example of the misapplication of patent law (I would like to see
someone argue that this ruling, and use of patents) was essential for the
advancemen of technlology (yes, yes I know if they didn't have this protection,
poor old Nintendo would go out of business :-)

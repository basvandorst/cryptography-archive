Given that this is commercial use and they are in the U.S., I doubt that
they'll be accepting PGP mail for the obvious legal reasons.

However, I see no reason why they couldn't accept PEM mail for this 
sort of commercial use. If asked, RSADSI would also likely grant 
permission to use RIPEM for book orders.

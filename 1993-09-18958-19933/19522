Grady responds to my post:

Egads.  If that's true, why do you call it "Moby Crypto"??
A crypto, by definition, can encrypt.

Grady, this is hyperbole.  While I will concede that a business
subjected to arbitrary regulations, and racial discrimination,
are both inherently unfair, beyond that there is little 
similarity.  Many crypto developers have done quite well 
despite the regulatory environment.

Wrong.  Discrimination against individuals is far more egregious
than a ruling (however mistaken) that a product has military
use and is thus restricted.

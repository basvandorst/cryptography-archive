Encrypt the code with a secure system and put the key in your will with
instructions to post the key on some newsgroup or mail to a list of
addresses, or both.

Perhaps somebody should set up a service like this.  They would hold the
encryped software and provide a 'request' address.  When the decrypt code
was made available to them they would decrypt and mail the software.

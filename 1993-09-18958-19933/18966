Sounds like a diabolical scheme to:

  (1)	Create a deliberate restraint of trade,
  (2)	Generage temporary windfall profits for ripoff software
	marketers,
  (3)	Destroy the US economy,
  (4)	Guarantee the steady growth of the economies of those asian
	countries who specialize in pirated version of software.

I will boycott any manufacturer who tries to foist such a chip on
the general public.  I suspect I will have lots of company.

Only if there are enough idiots who are willing to purchase their garbage.

In a strictly legal sense, you're correct.  However, I believe that
it's possible for these regs to be legally constitutional and morally
unconstitutional.  This government was founded with a document which
was infused with a strong belief system.  Like most belief systems,
it is open to interpretation, but I believe that there are some
fundamental tenets which have been violated.

The Supreme Court has effectively removed the 9th Amendment from the
Constitution, but I still believe in the concept behind it, and will
label anything that violates it "unconstitutional".  I will also tell
you why I believe this to be so.  My definition of "unconstitutional"
would be "violating the spirit or the letter of the Constitution, in my
opinion."  Relying on the Supreme Court to tell you what rights you
should and should not have seems to me to be the height of folly.

This government seems to have strayed a great deal from the principles
it was founded upon.  Perhaps Jefferson anticipated this sort of 
thing when he advocated frequent revolution -- if we cannot trust
the Supreme Court to defend our rights against the tentacles of 
the federal government, what other recourse is there?

You probably think that this is a lot of empty talk and pie-in-the-sky
idealism, but without this idealistic center, the Constitution is just
a piece of paper which is easily ignored by our courts with a little
illogic and hand-waving.

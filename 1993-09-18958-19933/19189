Certainly one write-over would allow some reconstruction of what was
there before, due to magnetic hysteresis. However, thermal expansion/
contraction of the disk platter could leave an untouched area after any number
of write-overs. To be sure, you'd need to subject the platter itself 
to a very strong (forget the number of oersteds) field. Or, use a 
belt sander on the disk surface. Either method destroys the drive.

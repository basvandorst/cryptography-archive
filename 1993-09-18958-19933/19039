    What it could possibly do is cause confusion among those who would 
want to send private mail, and in that way partially block all mail to 
the emulated user.  On a major network, the user WILL find out, but it 
will cost a bit of time before the correct keys get retransmitted and 
messages will have been lost.  So posting a key signature may cut back a 
little bit on wasted time in such situations.
    Granted, most of the users in the networks are honest, so there 
usually shouldn't be any problem...  but it only costs a few more bytes 
of data to relieve that nagging sense of paranoia a little bit more...

Downright lamentable, but it's hard to feel too robbed when the hacks
who write something like computer shopper blow it.  The only function of
that magazine is providing a phone book full of ads for clone parts.  I
think that the articles might be there only so that the statement of 
management and publication can say they're a magazine and not a catalog.

It's awfully nice of them to delete the key part of your objection.

An individual at the NSA has recently been warning
my publisher of Moby Crypto that they will be breaking
the law if they export the product.

Since I do not include any executables, only source
and other documentation that routinely appears in
textbooks that are exported, I think this hasseling 
is unwarranted and unconstitutional.

Since knocking heads with the NSA may result in
some kind of process, I need some assistance to
bolster my case.

What you can do: please send me a reference on every
book or magazine article you are aware of that
contains any 'source code'.  The code can be a fragment
or in any computer language as long as it implements
encryption or other material that would be
export controlled if incoporated in an executable.

I think collecting a large number of these citations
will help my attornies in pointing out the absurdity
of the situation to government attornies if necessary.

Please e-mail any citations that you have.  Thanks
ahead of time.

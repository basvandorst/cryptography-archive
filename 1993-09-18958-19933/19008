[ ... Hairbrained CPU Serialization scheme ... ]

First of all if you build a chip someone can CHANGE the serial number of
then someone will figure out HOW to do it.  Secondly someone may CLONE a
chip that has a programmable serial number making this worthless.  Of
course we can always let the federal gov't hop in to prevent this. 
After all when the Fed is involved prices are bound to go down right?

Perhaps, but I doubt it.  the AS/400 and S/36/38 CPU's have serial
numbers on them, and implement software security like you suggest.  I've
never seen an application for one of these machines that was under $3K,
so I don't think your premise will yield the desired results anyway. 
After all from a coding standpoint Copy protection is a pain in the ass
anyway, And like what if your machine S/N XXXXXX blows up or gets burned
in a fire?  How long before you can run all that expen$ive serialized
software huh?

Also there are plenty of companies that already implement similar
strategies without a hardware number.  I _AVOID_ their products whenever
possible.

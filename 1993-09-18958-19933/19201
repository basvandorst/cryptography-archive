Well, of course, there's no reason software licensed this way couldn't
have a "suspend" operation that stopped charging (and functioning).  For
that matter, a package priced so that the total cost for a
40-hour-a-week user over a year was reasonable would not cost very much
during the time you were away...

|   The problem is that it's not really a service - no matter how much or
|   how little you use a package, the s/w house still has to put the same
|   amount of effort into producing it in the first place (ignoring
|   supportlines, etc). So charging as though it *is* a service is

|   available.

I think a lot of people would like this model a lot.  It means a home
computer user who puts together a PTA newsletter could use professional
grade publishing tools without spending thousands of dollars for
software used a few times a year.  We all know there's no necessary link
between cost and price.  To many users, basing price on value received
by the user (measured by time used) would be preferable to basing price
on an arbitrary one-time charge.  Plus, it's easier to expense a
time-based charge than a purchase when you file your taxes, and you'd be
able to track current releases without repeated upgrade fees.

Of course, I expect vendors would also offer usage-based discounts for
heavy users and would probably offer maximum charges, too.

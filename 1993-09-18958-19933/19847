You're right that the publisher didn't really want to include a disk.  The
book was already very expensive ($44.95) and a disk would just add to the
cost.  Also, we all KNOW that cryptography source code can't be exported,
so including a disk would limit distribution to North America.  We all
wanted to be able to distribute the book internationally.  And finally,
the publisher didn't think that the book would be a big selling point.
They find that only a very small percentage of book purchasers ever sends
away for a disk, so they don't feel it is worth the money and bother to
include one with the book.

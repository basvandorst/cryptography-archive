Hey, this is usenet.  Flames are the rule, not the exception.  To voice
an idea that is not in the newsgroup's mainstream is to invite lots of
heat.  You have to use a microscope to watch for the few sparks of
light in all that hot air.  There are a few people who can be counted
on to give a well-reasoned response, and then there are the rest of us.

Feasible?  Marginally.  Desireable?  I suspect that there are (or will
be) niche markets in which this would be a desireable technology.

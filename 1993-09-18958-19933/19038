If someone buys software at a "pay according to usage" contract, and then let
you use it freely across the network, he will have to insert the dongle/card
and let your usage be charged to that card. Really this isn't much different
from the installation buying a huge inventory system (say) at USD 100,000 and
let everyone use it for free. If the installation wants to recover some of 
the costs, they must register your usage, and bill you accordingly, in both cases.

Obviously, one could devise a protocol for exchanging info between the 
installation and a card reader next to your teletype. Maybe some ideas could
be borrowed from Kerberos? (Charge at each ticket checkout?) 

I am not saying that this is trivial; I am not saying that we can device 
something to stop illegal copying overnight. I am saying that this is something
we might consider.

I don't see what DOS/PCs have to do with this. Magnetic card stripe readers
have been used with huge IBM mainframes for years. I believe that there even
was a DIN (Deutche Industrie Normen) requirements for a card reader option on
dumb terminals, in order to be granted a certain level of certification.
Replacing a magnetic card with a smartcard can be done without replacing
your terminal with a PC.

(Whether it is a good idea or not to have some sort of intelligence close to
the user - that be PCs, Unix workstations or anything else - is a different
discussion).

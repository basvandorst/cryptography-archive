	Actually, your ATM card contains a number called your PAN (Personal
Account Number) this number may or may not be the same as your checking
account number.  This number, along with your PIN number and some numbers
entered into the ATM itself are used to do a DES encryption to determine
if the PIN entered matches your PAN number.  At least, this is how the IBM
3624 ATMS that are commonly used work.  This way, the ATM never has to send
your PIN number to the host system for validation.  Also, because there are
some secret numbers entered into the ATM you just can't encrypt the PAN
some way to come up with the corresponding PIN number.  Pretty smart, eh?

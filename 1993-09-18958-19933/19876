I think the situation people are concerned about when they talk about
frequent key-changes is where several messages have independent value
to a potential interceptor.  Just as an example, if I send you two
messages saying a) "The diamonds are buried under the mansion" and b)
"The gold is buried under the barn", either of these is of use to an
enemy -- and I'd rather that just one of these messages were
intercepted than that both were, given the choice.  If the enemy can
only *afford* to crack one key, then it makes sense to use two keys
for the two messages, so at least one will probably remain safe.

Btw. I entirely agree about the pointlessness of changing a password
which is already a good one.

Yours, Lulu...

this was the infamous Juarez, Mexico f--kup. (There have been numerous
similar incidents as well).

 In more or less 1984 a cobalt (highly radioactive) therapy mahcine was
dumped as scrap bt a Juarez hospital. In the dumpyard it was dismantled,
and the nice little bb sized pellets (highly radioactive) spilled out and
spread through the neighborhood.  (kids ilked the nice warm feeling)

Also, pieces of it were smelted into reinforcing bar, table legs, etc.

First notification came when a truck carrying some of the stuff passed one
of the radiation detectors at ?Los Alamos?. they got a bit upset when the
alrms went off...

at -that- time customs was NOT doing radiation scanning. However, the
California Highway Patrol did do them at (occassional) weighing stations.

I don't know how and if the policies have been changed since then.

Further info should be available from the folk on sci.physics or some
such. I'd reset followup but not sure I can do that from thsi mailer.

take care

Doesn't DOE still have the NEDS system in place?  I think that stood for
Nuclear Event Detection System or whatever.  It was a few hundred sensitve
radiation monitors designed to detect fissile material being smuggled
into or out of the harbors and highways of the US.  It was supposed to
be a piece of crap, though.  Never worked right.  Haven't heard about
it for, oh, fifteen years or so.

Still, the cobalt-xx pelets gives me an idea - couldn't I buy one of
these canisters and, say, bury it outside the bedroom window of someone
I don't like?  Or maybe an x-ray tube on a timer or remote control?
That last one sounds like a hoot - the target goes to the hospital with
obvious radiation exposure, but when the sensors are run through his
house, they find nothing, cuz I'm across the street with the on/off
switch.  So, they give him a dosimiter to wear, and it fogs right up,
still they find nothing.  Sounds like a plot for an episode of Columbo.

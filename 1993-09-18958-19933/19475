Two comments:

First, this message, like some others, assumes a malevolent intelligence
operating in a deliberate way. Far more likely the whole PGP issue has
gradually escalated to the attention of the bureaucracy (such organisms are
slow to notice new signals and even slower to respond), and is trying to
figure it out.

Read Phil Zimmerman's message. It's still possible to help them figure it
out in a constructive way. Let's cool it until we see where this is going.

Second, compelling caution by random but high-penalty enforcement is not
some bureaucratic trick but a well established social science technique.
Ithiel de Sola Pool wrote about this when he was at MIT, and I published a
chapter in a book pointing out how this could be a useful approach to
compelling caution on the part of those who would otherwise pollute the
coastal zones: "Coastal Zone Management: Multiple Use With Conservation" ed.
F. Peel Brahtz, Wiley 1972; Chapter 7: "Systems Planning and Control, Coastal
Regions" by David Sternlight.

Perhaps you wondered why just before tax time, the IRS goes after and widely
publicizes egregious cases of tax fraud. It's to compel caution in filling
out one's tax return.

This is a very economically efficient approach--it has low cost to the
taxpayers compared with universal investigation, and reaps large benefits in
prevention.

False.  Sorry to be so blunt, but .... false.  THe first amendment covers all
speech.  It may be that certain forms of "commercial speech" are
entitled to a lesser form of protection than classic political speech, but the
test is NOT historical in any case.

Actually this is a very good analogy: the first amendment DOES apply to GM on
these facts, just as it applies to all of us, always.  [You can however
contract away  some free speech rights, as I had to do to get a security
clearance, but that's another, irrlevant, story....]

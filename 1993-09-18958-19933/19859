I believe this to be a classical beginner's statistical blunder. Key search
is sequential. If you change your key to a new one in the region that has
already been searched, it is safer than the old one which is now in a subset
of the search space yet unsearched.

Key search, being sequential, has quite different probability properties
than independent coin tosses, unless the key search is random rather than
sequential. Random key search is unlikely to be used in a "brute force"
approach.

Or am I missing something?

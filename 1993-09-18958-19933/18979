How are you going to convince the hardware companies that it's in their best
interest to add such elaborate hardware to their chips? I expect that if a
hardware manufacturer tried such a scheme they would be laughed out of the
marketplace.

Software companies are much better off writing simple, easy to understand,
and fair license agreements. These can be enforced, at least at companies
bigger than garages, by offering monetary incentives for employees to report
software theft in their companies. This approach would be much less insulting
than stupid SPA ads showing pirate patches and handcuffs.

Why don't software companies already do this? For example, why don't they
widely publicize $100,000 rewards for information leading to either a civil
or criminal judgement against someone stealing software? Probably because
most of them realize that software piracy isn't a very serious problem in
business in the U.S. It may be different in some foreign markets, but that's
where the companies are already protecting their software with dongles.

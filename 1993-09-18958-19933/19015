The only forged key I've ever seen was a PGP key for Jim Bidzos, but the
chances of anyone believing in its authenticity are, I'd say, pretty low :-).

Of course the fact that noone has ever done it and that there are a thousand
easier ways to get at someone's private communications than spoofing keys 
doesn't mean that there isn't a possibility that someone, somewhere, may 
decide to do it.
 
The main threat is when the key is used for authentication rather than 
privacy.

Peter.

For an unclassified, but still workable, description of all that's involved
in building a nice nuke, you might want to read Tom Clancy's "The Sum of
All Fears".  It also has the added benefit of being one helluva good
science/adventure novel!

Granted, he leaves out some of the Gory Details of nuke costruction (under
the premise that not everybody needs to know them - tho' the Bad Guys
probably already do, anyway...), it's still sufficient to inform.

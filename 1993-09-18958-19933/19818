Neat stuff.
Does the book talk about the Initial and Final Permutations?
Do they improve security?
Software DES people have long complained their only effect
is to make software implementations more difficult.

Does it discuss the Key Scheduling permutations?
Could a simpler key schedule have been used without weakening security?

What is the behaviour of DES on a given 64 bit plaintext. If I know
the mapping of a single 64bit plaintext to 64 bit encrypted, does that
uniquly identify the key? Or are there multiple mappings for a given 
64 bits. ( I supose this is the same as asking whether or not the Unix
crypt(3) is one to one)

Since for its encryption function one can easily defeat this approach
by useing say triple DES, this does not seem that much of a danger-
Howver it does say that any Unix password is now completely open to
anyone with the $1M --Time for a new password algorithm ( as if we did
not already know that).

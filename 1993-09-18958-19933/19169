You have to do a bit more.  You have to ensure that the media remain readable.
You have to establish the version history and include the trouble report
history in the escrow.  Design documents should be included.  Someone
responsible to the escrow agent should verify that the software can be
built on the specified system with the specified compiler.  And, perhaps,
a licensed copy of the development system/operating system/other platform
software should be included in the escrow package.

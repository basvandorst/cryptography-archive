i am trying to implement the DES algorithm but the source i am 
using (Patterson, _Mathematical Cryptology_) is unclear on a couple of points:

	1) the initial permutation matrix IP is given, but not IP(-1).
	   what are the contents of this matrix?
	2) in the decryption process, can the final key K(16) be derived
	   directly from the original key, or must K(1), K(2),..., K(15)
	   all be calculated to reach K(16)?

thanks

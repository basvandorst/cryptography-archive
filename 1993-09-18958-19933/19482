   Not to argue for the "other side", but the distinction between "source
   code" and "executable" is really one of semantics.  If I have a C
   interpretter, then your "source code" could also be considered
   an "executable".  With a compiler, it's an easy matter to turn the
   source code into an executable.  On the other hand, the distinction between
   printed and magnetic media is getting less and less distinguishable
   too.  With cheap scanners and OCR technology, source code printed
   on paper is really not *that* different from source code on
   magnetic media which is only marginally different from executable code.

A while ago, somebody posted a Mathematica description of the RSA algorithm;
reasonable mathematical notation, and directly interpretable.
A few other precise forms of mathematical description, widely used at
one time or another, include the ALgorithmic Language (ALGOL) which
the ACM collected algorithms were in for many years, the lambda calculus
(approx-equal "LISP"), and Ken Iverson's matrix notation (APL).

While producing fast, small, lean&mean code still requires some effort :-)
fundamentally algorithms, source, executables, paper, magnetic,
and electronic-transmission versions are really all the same thing -
if we still have the freedom of speech and the press, to the extent
that we can talk to non-Yankees, and are allowed to do mathematics,
then exporting executables or equivalent is just a corollary.

And if want to really prevent us from exporting executables, 
then either they need to outright ban mathematical thought and speech, 
or they need to do selective enforcement and similar legal terrorism.
Or they need to give up and leave us alone.

 OK, but *why* is a product cipher strong?  I think the answer is
 that the individual techniques have *different kinds* of strength.
 Where one may be weak, the other is strong, and the product
 operation makes it necessary to surmount both.

 This does not mean that substitution, alone, does not have any
 strength.  It does mean that the careful cipher designer will not
 use the tool of substitution in a way which emphasizes its
 weaknesses.  I am unaware of any tool in cryptographic design
 which does *not* have some weakness.

 Nope, not necessary.

 Sure it can:

 First we assume that (by some mysterious process which is currently
 beside the point), a substantial User Key phrase (or some other key
 data) has appeared at both ends.

 Next, the two ends negotiate under the cover of a minimal standard
 (such as DES-CBC), to agree upon a different and stronger cipher.

 When the agreed-upon cipher is used, the definition of that cipher
 includes key processing which initializes a cryptographic RNG,
 which then shuffles the desired substitution tables.  This produces
 unique tables which are wholly dependent on the User Key; thus, the
 tables have effectively been "sent" in the key itself.

 Well, sure.  First of all, the original contact probably must be
 under some minimal cipher available to all installations, such as
 DES-CBC.  Then "the correspondents" (their machines) negotiate a
 mutually-acceptable serious cipher.  Then they use it.

 I don't say that every cipher *must* generate new substitution
 tables.  I just say that the standard should not demand that
 ciphers produce binary results and then use the cryptographically-
 meaningless known transformation to transportable ASCII.  The RFC
 should allow each cipher to establish its own transformation.


 Then, in <CE0rAE.7sB@informatik.uni-hamburg.de>:

 That is a big part of the reason first two Propositions.  Without
 security for the cryptographer, the security of the cryptosystem
 is irrelevant.

 I think there is some advantage to arguing that the use of a cipher
 is itself a matter of personal choice and privacy, just like the
 choice to use a condom.  This argument is somewhat hard to make
 when a cipher announces its use to the whole world.  Can you
 imagine trying to sell condoms which make their use a matter of
 public record?

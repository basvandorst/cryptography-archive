You ought to say 'Britain' because otherwise you upset those in the other
countries which make up Britain because you probably meant to include them 
as well.

All you need to do is use a non-standard IF in your TV because the radiated 
signal will then be at a different frequency for a given TV channel. Having
said that, there are other means of detection which can be employed to get
round this.

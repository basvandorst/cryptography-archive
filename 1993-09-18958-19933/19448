Rahul, the mandate of the president is to lead the nation and to
protect the constitution. That didn't stop Nixon from violating the
hell out of it to enhance and protect his personal power. The NSA,
like every other agency, consists of individuals who share different
goals. The threat of prison time, lawsuit, or just plain embarassing
failure will prevent misbehavior much more swiftly and effectively
than a subtle change of mandate and laws that they may already ignore.

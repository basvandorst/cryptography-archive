Credit card user authentication

I know that you stipulated that no additional hardware should be 
required but...

Credit card sized challenge and response systems added to PIN, card 
holder details etc could provide another layer of protection. If the 
card companies did decide to use challenge / response systems then the 
volumes involved would make the cost trivial.

: There's a big difference between an informal description of an algorithm

: inconsistencies, I think having different export rules for source and
: object code would be a better example.

I've had two patent attorneys give me the opinion that source code
is different in kind from object (executable) code with respect to
patent law and its 'making, using, and selling' an infringing device.

I'm simply applying this distinction to cryptographic 'devices' and
their 'export' contrasted to cryptographic algorithms, no matter how
precise (source code) and their publication. 



I do not argue that the State Department can regulate crypto devices
or unpublished research into crypto; I do argue that publishing ideas
embodied in source is protected by the first amendment.

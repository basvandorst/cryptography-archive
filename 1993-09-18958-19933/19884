At one large institution, a rule was brought in that everyone had to change
their password every month, and every password had to contain alpha as well
as numeric characters.

I observed that the security manager himself used the passwords `KEVIN7',
`KEVIN8' and so on for the different months of the year.

It is not altogether clear what lessons should be drawn from this, but
certainly one cannot assume that old passwords present no security risk,

The highly popular verifone series ATM machines use what seems to be
a 300 or 110 baud modem for their communications...  Not hard at all
to tap.. could do in in an hour or less with my old accoustic 300
baud modem... :-)

ObProposedHack:  Take my old 300 baud accoustic modem and use it to
                 crack into the ATM boxes.

ActualHack:  Converting the 300 baud accoustic modem into a non-accoustic
             modem with 10 minutes of soldering and a small transformer
             and a phone connector... :-)  Worked!

Fine in theory, but...

People in the computer industry tend to change jobs frequently, so it's not
inconceivable your e-mailed CC number could pass through a machine run by
someone who you've upset in the past.  As you say, if they do get the number
and order goods in your name you can get the CC company to take them back
and refund.  But what if the item they order for you happens to be a ton of
horse manure to be dumped in your front yard?

I'd say using PGP to encrypt e-mailed CC numbers is a very sensible idea,
and that any company taking e-mail orders ought to think about it.  Of
course, US companies will have to wait for the legal version to come out...

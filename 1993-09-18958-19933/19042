If the on-board frame buffer of a Sun IPC or LX goes bad, the standard
fix _by the Sun repair crew_ is to replace the motherboard, and move
the old CPU-id PROM to the new motherboard.  The CPU-id is still
matched to the serial number stenceled on the back of the system unit.
Note that this particular PROM does _not_ contain the system
monitor/BIOS, it only contains about twelve bytes of data.  Sun blew it
by sticking the fact that the system uses a IPC or LX motherboard into
this PROM, because one can buy an upgrade motherboard for one's IPC and
turn it into an LX.  Same box (but with a new decal for the front),
same power supply, same DASD, same keyboard, same mouse, same monitor.
At this point, the serial number stenceled on the back of the system
unit is no longer in sync with the CPU-id contained in the PROM.

I'll call Sun and relay your opinion.  8-)

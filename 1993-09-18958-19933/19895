   It's counterintuitive, but true, that changing the key often is of no
   help against the enemy who is attacking your encryption method with
   exhaustive search.

That's partially correct for logins, but incorrect for message streams.
For example, suppose you change your password every 5 minutes for
calls (or every 5KB for mail messages).

In a message stream, such as an encrypted phone conversation or 
a bank EFT wire, this limits the amount of data that's compromised
to 5 minutes of voice or EFT traffic, or 5KB of email.
In a login session, if the bad guy happens to guess your password
correctly and log in (which is still less likely, for reasons other
callers have mentioned), then he can modify enough things to allow
future logins (e.g. setuid shells on Unix, or trojan horses of other
colors elsewhere), or simply delete all your files if he's crudely malicious.

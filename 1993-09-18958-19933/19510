U.S. manufacturers of crypto equipment have been required to
register in this fashion as long as I can remember.  It's
no big deal.

I don't see what all the hub-bub is about.  I mean, when
you enter into a given line of business you routinely
check out what the regulatory environment is.  For example, I 
would not open up a corner liquor store without figuring out
what licenses I need to sell liquor.  That would make
no sense.  I suppose as an act of civil disobedience, I
could argue that liquor shouldn't be subject to licensing
and excise taxes.  That might be a credible, if painful,
way to make a valid political statement.

But I would not open up said liquor store in complete
ignorance of the licensing situation, and then call
it a "stunning development" when the ABC comes over
to shut me down...

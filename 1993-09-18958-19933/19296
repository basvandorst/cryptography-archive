Grady has now encountered the difference between lay argumentation here and
the administration of the real world. It will be interesting to see how it
comes out.

Since no amount of argumentation here will change the real-world situation,,
I suggest anyone who wishes to assist grady do so by e-mail rather than
assisting in yet another interminable thread that produces no result.

This is not an attempt to muzzle anyone, but rather to place the issue in
perspective.

An exposion is basically a very big fire in a very small place happening
very quickly.

Matches are made of _red_ phosphorus, sulfur, and a couple of other
relatively minor chemicals.  The common 'safety' match lights when the
friction of striking heats it enough to ignite the phosphorus; 'strike
anywhere' matches contain a high-_white_-phosphorus-content chemical at
the TIP, which ignites a *whole* lot easier.

There is a book called NETWORK SECURITY SECRETS, by Stand and Moon, published
by IDG Books.  A disk is included with the book, and on that disk is a
program that does DES encryption.  The book is being sold internationally.

I had my editor at Wiley call their editor at IDG.  They seem to have some
inkling that there might be a problem, but aren't really worrying about it.
I don't know how much of their thinking is "ignorance is bliss" and how
much is "it's easier to ask for forgiveness than permission," but it seems to
be working so far.  No one from the government has called them.

My publisher isn't nearly as reckless.  Early in our negotiations, my editor
told me:  "A little controversty is good; having our warehouse padlocked by
the Feds is bad."

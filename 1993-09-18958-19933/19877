It seems to me that you are both right, and wrong.  To be secure from detection
by an exhaustive search the password must be changed before the password is
encountered and used.  Since there is no way to detect where in the search
space the search is at any given time, some changes will improve security (i.e.
changing to a password already checked) and some will not improve security
(i.e. changing to another password that has not been checked).  In some cases
the change will speed the search by choosing a password that the searcher will
try sooner than the previous password, and in some cases it will slow the
search by moving the current password farther from the "search frontier".

As the search progresses the number of "safe" passwords increases, but so has 
the chance that the password has already been guessed.  If you have some idea
of the search speed you can probably determine the optimal rate of new password
generation that will maximixe the chance that the password will not get found
by the searcher.  In no case can you guarantee that it will not be found, since
there is always the chance that you will "leap right in front of the headlights"
so to speak, and choose as your new password the next password the searcher is
going to try.

It seems to me that you need to change passwords frequently enough that even
if the password is guessed it will be changed before it can be used.  That,
combined with changing frequently enough to make guessing optimally difficult,
is the best you can do with a simple password system.

To improve security you have to add other features, such as the VMS method of
lying about password authenticity once a breakin is suspected (suspicion is
raised by several failed password input attempts).  Other ways to improve
security include non-password pre-agreed information such as the algorithmic
approach (i.e. I'll give you a number, you square it, add three and send it
back) with several previously agreed upon algorithms.  Sort of like a secret
handshake that varies with time of day, phase of the moon or the relative
heights of the two participants.  Even recording one exchange will not let you
get in and there is little chance of guessing the correct reply.

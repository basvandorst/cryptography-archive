It wouldn't help much here in the United States.  The courts have ruled (in
some cases -- I don't remember the specifics) that the escrow can be closed
in case the company goes bankrupt, as that protects an asset of the
bankrupt company that should belong to creditors.  (I believe that the
specific case involved source code escrow to protect the customer against
the vendor failing to upgrade to the customers new computers, as required
by contract.)

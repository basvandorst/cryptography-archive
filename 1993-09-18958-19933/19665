But there's a big danger here. A few years afo, a taxpayer selected for IRS's
notorious taxpayer compliance measurement program refused to cooperate. The
way TCMP worked was the government demanded all your records about everything
but in excahnge promised it wouldn't bring a criminal case based on the 
information. The taxpayer, in effect, rejected the immunity and wouldn't play.
So the IRS turned the guy over to its Intelligence (read Criminal) Div. which
found some niggling ground for going after him, as they could with just about 
any of us. Mr. Taxpayer brought suit charging that IRS was harrassing him for 
his nonparticipation in TCMP. The court agreed, but said there was no law 
preventing the IRS from doing it.

So you can play gaves with the government--but don't count on winning.

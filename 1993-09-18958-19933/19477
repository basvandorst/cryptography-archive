As long as many are speculating, I'll do a bit myself. Note that like many
other speculations, this one is made up of whole cloth. Don't take this
message more seriously than to chuckle, and maybe acknowledge that there's
more than one possible explanation for a given behavior.

Suppose the crypto laws as presently written require Congressonal action to
change.

Suppose also that there are strong conservative forces that would fight this
tooth and nail.

Suppose that the Clinton administration has concluded that export of
"secure" crypto is in fact more valuable as a business opportunity than it
is adverse to the interests of the intelligence community.

One neat way to handle the situation is to bring a prosecution against a
case where the facts are very strong on the defendant's side, and lose.

Thereafter, the court decision could be cited as the basis for refusing to
stop U.S. companies from selling secure crypto abroad.

(Of course I made this up, but so did those who see some evil plan in all
this.)

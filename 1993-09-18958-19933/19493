What if God made a rock so big that He couldn't lift it?  Would He still
be all-powerful?

Seriously, I don't know--after all, you said the conversation was being
recorded, but you didn't say the recording was being made on that
particular machine and you didn't say there was only one recording
device in use.  If government agents assume that since they've destroyed
the only recording device they saw, that means they aren't being
recorded any more, that might just have to be their problem.

However, the law isn't always susceptible to reductio ad absurdum
defense; the judge might also say that had clearly demonstrated their
non-consent to the recording, and that any recording you made after that
was illegal, or at best, inadmissible.

This is GREAT! ----------------------------------------------|

Just one question, though...how do air and fire combine to make mud?

A fanatic is someone who does what he knows that God would do if God knew the
facts of the case.

Some mailers apparently munge my address; you might have to use
bsmart@bsmart.tti.com -- or if that fails, fall back to
72027.3210@compuserve.com.  Ain't UNIX grand?

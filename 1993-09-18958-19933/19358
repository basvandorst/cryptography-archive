WARLOCK PKC as an Internet PEM Security Option -----
 
WARLOCK PKC developers (Wilson and Craig) are interested in 
discussing the possibility of making WARLOCK freely available at 
no charge as an Internet PEM security option.  A technical paper 
describing WARLOCK was electronically published on sci.crypt in 
June.  The WARLOCK C++source program as well as an MS/DOS exe
cutable and technical paper are all available from ripem.msu.edu 
under pub/crypt/other/warlock-4.0.zip or by email request to 
WARLOCK@acm.org.
 
There is no government involvement whatever in WARLOCK nor in
volvement with PK Partners.  WARLOCK is solely a product of 
Wilson and Craig and is protected by 2 assigned patents with a 
third one expected to issue in the next six weeks.  Would appro
priate members of the Internet Engineering Task Force please 
respond if interested.

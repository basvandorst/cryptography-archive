:       foreign hams speak English as the common ham radio language. WE ARE NOT
:       PROHIBITED from talking with any foreign ham radio operator at this time
:       (emphasis mine).
:
:  What is misleading here is that the Q&A is NOT a regulation -- it's only
:testing understanding of ham radio operating principles. In _principle_
:the US Govt can place any restrictions it wants on ham radio at any time. In
:practice, this was done only once, in 1917-1919 during WWI, for perceived
:security reasons. There has been no imposition since, and the current regulations

   I beg to differ.  When I got my Novice license in 1967, there were four
countries on the prohibited list.  As it's now 26 years later, I can't
remember which ones they were, nor can I find them in my 1969 Radio
Amateur's Handbook; but it was definitely anathema to talk to anyone in
those countries.

:do not prohibit you from talking with any ham in any country. Further, no
:foreign laws (according to the FCC) currently exist preventing hams from 
:communicating, but even if there were such laws, you aren't violating a US 
:law by talking with such a ham -- you're only violating that foreign law. 

   I believe the regulations here are written in such a way as to make it
illegal for us to communicate with hams in such countries (indeed, if I
remember right, two of the four in the prohibited list back then were
prohibited solely because the OTHER country prohibited _their_ hams from
talking to _us_).  In any event, it's my understanding that any other
country that bans communications with US hams ends up on that restricted
list.

:  But there aren't any such foreign laws at the moment (and have never been
:as far as I know). Note that the FCC's clarification of the answer plainly
:states "We are not prohibited from talking with any foreign ham radio operator
:at this time."  That should settle the matter.

Hi

Quick question on Novell 4.0 lack of protected memory option.
How serious, if any, is the security threat .  Quote from datapro may 1993 

"it allows several processes to run on the same server without intruding 
on each other's memroy space.  Lack of protected-memory ...  was not 
considered critical shortcoming in server operating systems until 
the advent of clinet/server architecture...Many analysts consider running 
two or more NetWare NLMs on the same server RISKY [emphasis added]
situation..."

Now - really how serious is this risk.

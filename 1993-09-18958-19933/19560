   Unfortunately, it doesn't work that way for a number of reasons.  (I am
NOT an attorney; I've just found this out the hard way.  I also have a friend
who's an attorney, who's shot down many of my best ideas through the methods
which follow.)
   One thing is case law, which seems to supercede written law.  If some
total dork in the past has made a binding decision that seems to, or actually
does, contradict the written laws, the courts use the previous decision, not
the written law, as the basis for their decision.
   Another example which should be obvious is the grand jury process itself.
Many highly illegal things there; one example is the fact that you can be
jailed at the whim of the judge for not doing what he damn well wants you
to do, legal or not, violation of your rights or not, etc., for the duration
of the existence of the grand jury (i.e. until it's "unempaneled" (?)).  No
trial, no jury, no appeal; just "I, God, sentence you to be imprisoned for
the duration of the existence of this grand jury investigation."
   We can read and understand the law, given a good vocabulary and a sense
for twisted reasoning.  But only a good attorney really understands its
actual application in the real world.
   Now THAT'S job security.

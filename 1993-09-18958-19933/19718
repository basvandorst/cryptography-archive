The book is called APPLIED CRYPTOGRAPHY, and will be in bookstores in
November.  There is no source code disk included with the book, since
that would limit export of the book.  There is a source code disk
available from me (for an extra fee) for U.S. citizens only.

There are about 100 pages of source code IN the book, including IDEA,
DES, FEAL, REDOC III, SHA, MD5.  But paper is covered under the First
Amendement.

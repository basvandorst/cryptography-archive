At this point I am willing to stop pursuing the "publisher" distinction
based on a piece of e-mail I received, which points out that State's position
is that even if one is a publisher, crypto materials are defense articles
under the munitions list and thus publisher or not, one is also a producer
of defense articles and must as such register. In fact, my correspondent
goes on to argue, for much cryptographic material the normal form of
distribution may make one a publisher, and thus the distinction "publisher"
is a distinction without a difference in the present instance.

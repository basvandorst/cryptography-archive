No.  For a given key DES is 1-1 and "onto",
but other keys might happen to map the a particular P to the same C.
I think someone posted a few examples here a while back.

The *IX password encryption function crypt(3) uses a modified DES (the "salt").
Wiener's machine would need to be modified to support that.
Also, crypt(3) iterates DES 25 times (DES has 16 "rounds", crypt(3) has 400),
which would also require modifications to the machine.
A modified $1M Wiener machine would then require 3.5*25 == 87 hours
to crack a password.  Not much better, admittedly.
The BSD 4.4 crypt(3) also supports a "new style" of encryption
which has a 24 bit "iteration count" (and a 24-bit salt and long passwords).
An iteration count of 2500 would result in 8700 hours to crack the password.
(Of course, using Weiner's machine + dictionary attack would be
rather effective on typical passwords.)

There are several services that provide software escrow
services.  You can set up accounts with banks, lawyers, etc.

We are an offsite storage service and have provided escrow
services for more than 8 years.  We see mostly source code
escrow accounts, but I have set up more involved escrow accounts
including multi-party, with provision for blind auditing and 
multi-version support.

I love it. We can always count on Bill for amusing and interesting examples.

But on the substance the courts may find a distinction between that case,
where the keeping of the records in Hebrew wasn't improper but common in
some circles, and where Hebrew translators would be available to the court,
and a case of encrypted records which were designed for concealment, and for
which the court couldn't "ordinarily" obtain someone who could render them
into English on sight.

Bill's citation seems to me to turn more on the issue of where the burden of
what might be considered an "ordinary" and fairly low cost lies to translate
the Hebrew records than it does on the issue of encryption of records and
the compelling of keys.

Keep up the good posts, Bill. Though I disagree with many of your positions,
you are always worth reading.

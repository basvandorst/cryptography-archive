     I have just been introduced to PGP for encrypting email messages.  
The program works very well and suits our needs.  However I have been told
that there is a problem using the software in the US because of a potential
patent infringement.  As a result I would like to know if anyone has licensed
the technology from PKP [owners of the patent] or is there another package
that is equivalent to PGP that can be used for commercial use.  Please send
replies to Cumbo@esvax.dnet.dupont.com.  Thanks in advance for your help.

The basic idea is not new:

@InProceedings(BestPhysSec,
	Key="Best",
	Author="Robert M. Best",
	Title="Preventing Software Piracy With
		Crypto-Microprocessors",
	BookTitle="Proceedings of IEEE Spring COMPCON 80",
	Year="1980",
	Month="February",
	Pages="466")

There are also many other security applications that are solved by a
slightly stronger system, e.g., host integrity check, electronic
currency, etc.  Basically, all security systems that supposedly work
in a distributed environment fall flat in the face of physical access,
because there's no safe place to keep secrets (e.g., encryption keys)
private and data safe from tampering (e.g., host OS cryptographic
checksums, electronic wallet balance) unless the distribution is only
among locked rooms.  The following will appear soon (editors are hard
at work):

@InProceedings(DyadBoston,
	Key="Tygar, Yee",
	Author="J. D. Tygar and Bennet S. Yee",
	Title="Dyad:  A System for Using Physically Secure Coprocessors",
	BookTitle="Proceedings of the Joint Harvard-MIT Workshop on
		Technological Strategies for the Protection of Intellectual
		Property in the Network Multimedia Environment",
	Note="To Appear",
	Month=April, Year=1993)

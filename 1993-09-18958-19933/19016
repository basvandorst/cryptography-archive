I'd like to see a homebrew secure telephone that (1) didn't depend on one 
specific variety of hardware (SoundBlaster is nice, but there's other stuff
out there, including other machines that have audio capability that isn't 
soundblaster-based), and (2) was modular to handle machines of different 
performance (if your machine can't encrypt 32Kbps voice, have a protocol to
drop the speed to 16Kbps or 8Kbps). It would be nice if the program were 
standard based as much as possible, to take advantage of existing knowledge
in telephony.

On a related note, has it ever proven useful in cryptanalysis to model
English text as anything other than a memoryless process?  I've read
of analyses in which text was modeled as a second or third order
Markov source, reducing the entropy estimation by substantial amounts
compared to that obtained from a zeroth order process.  These
analyses, however, were always done in the context of data compression
rather than cryptography.

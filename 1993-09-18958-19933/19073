This should be contrasted with statements regarding the `useful
lifetime' of Clipper given in response to EFF questions on
ftp.eff.org:/pub/EFF/legislation/clipper-answers just recently 
made available (but quoted in a recent issue of EFF Online):

Based on recent readings, it seems Denning may be a bit more overzealous
than the NSA actually is. One speculated here she is the `anonymous
administration source' quoted as suggesting in one news account 
that domestic cryptographic regulation is on the table. In the same 
answers quoted from the EFF site, cryptographic regulation is deemed
`drastic' and `imprudent' (while also ominously hinting that this is only
the case under *current* circumstances). Her recent American Scientist
article also is suggestively ambiguous on the possibility of regulation.

Of course, it is possible these statements were offered prior
to a tactical NSA/NIST decision. However, taken together, all this suggests
that while Denning is closely allied with the NSA, her public statements
are not to be taken as wholly representative of the agency position--there
is an apparent lack of precise synchrony.

Also, to further the official comparisons of Skipjack to DES raised
by D. Koontz <koontzd@nebula.lrcs.loral.com> here, the rest of the
question/response quoted above starts:

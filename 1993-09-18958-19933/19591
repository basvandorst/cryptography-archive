   Help me to understand this argument. It seems to fly in the face of the
   government's ability to compel documents during discovery.

Well, the Constitution may be an outdated piece of paper having little
to do with the current actions of the courts and the government,
but it *does* have a lot more words on the right not to be forced to
testify against yourself and the right to be secure in your person and
your papers than it does on the government's power to compel documents.

(sarcasm mode off, paranoia mode on)
Of course, since the doctrine of _in rem_ proceedings allows the
government to file civil suits against misbehaving cars, planes, and money,
separate from the issue of criminal proceedings against their owner,
I suppose it could file civil suits against all your papers
and torture them until they confess, but with encryption that might
take a while :-)  But they might not give them back.

Has anyone actually challenged the RSA patents in court? I often hear
complaints that they are over-broad and patents on mathematical formulae
which are prohibited by patent law, but I never have heard about
successful or unsuccessful challenges that are actually settled in court
rather than out of court.  Just curious....

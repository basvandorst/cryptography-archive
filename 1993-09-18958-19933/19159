Does bitwise xor scrambling of data with a pseudo-random noise sequence
(yielded by a selectable characteristic polynomial and seed state)
provide decent data security? (provided the PN-generating polynomial and
seed are unknown).  What methods besides brute-force seed and polynomial
trial and error can be used to decode such data?

How can an estimate of the security of such a scrambling be arrived at?

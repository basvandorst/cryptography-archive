Software escrows of this type are a perfectly normal feature of the software
business, quite independent of copy protection. They are typically required
when a large company buys a significant piece of software from a small 
company whose future they do not want to depend on too heavily. Typical
language allows the escrowed source to fall into the hands of the customer
if the company goes bankrupt.

Dave,

I don't know of any programs that do that but one test to see if you
cipertext is any good is to zip it or arc it up.  Make a large
ciphertext, about 200k, and zip it.  If it compresses at all it is
probibly not that secure.  If it doesn't compress it doesn't mean
its secure either but at least you know that the redundancy is not
that short.

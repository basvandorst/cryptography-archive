This is actually quite close.  You take a copy of the source code, give it
to a bank, along with a set of instructions (and, of course, pay the bank for
its trouble).  The instructions say something like "release this tape to
company X if company Y (a) goes out of business, (b) no longer supports the
XYZ product, (c) other conditions, etc.  There may be clause that company X
can get the tape at any time by paying a sufficiently high fee.   This is
intended to avoid the case where the tape get locked up in a receivership
battle (once company X has the tape, now the money is locked up in the
court fight, but at least company X has access to the program).

This type of arrangement was often requested by big companies buying
software from the small company of which I was a part at the time (VALID
Logic Systems Inc.).  As far as I know these arrangements were never tested.

So software escrow is quite common, but not sophisticated in the cryptographic
sense.

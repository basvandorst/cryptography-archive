You mean ANY manufacturer of a cryptographic equipment must register? (The
original letter mentioned individuals as well as companies.) This
seems a bit extreme to me. I can *almost* understand requiring it if
they are exporting, but if all they are doing is doing some simple
mathmatical calculations, why should they register with the government?
Do you mean to tell me that if kids make up a 'secret code' they have to
register? They just manufactured a piece of cryptographic equipment. No
where was it stated how secure this piece of cryptographic equipment had
to be before registration.

I think the problem is that either the person who wrote the original
letter either made a mistake or there is a BIG problem with this
registration process.

Just my buck three eighty.

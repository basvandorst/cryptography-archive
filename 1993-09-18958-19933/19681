No, you've got it wrong. First of all the registration is as a manufacturer
of defense articles, and has nothing to do with international anything.
RSADSI, IBM, anyone who makes and sells crypto software or systems (as
defined broadly in the rules to include flow charts, source code, etc.) is
required to register. I'm not sure about algorithms.

Secondly, journals and books would probably be exempt unless they published
source code or something equally specific, but that's only a guess on my
part.

Thirdly, the rules are apparently only enforced as a function of whether
something comes to the attention of State or Defense, and as a function of
the direct usability (don't ask me to define it, I'm speculating) of the
material.

Dunno if Cryptologia had to register or not.

Finally, please note that the above is an attempt to summarize my
understanding of how it is, not whether it is right, wrong, I agree,
disagree, etc. so please keep your "cool, rational" Bontchev hat on and
leave your "committed convictions" hat at home with respect to the author of
this message.

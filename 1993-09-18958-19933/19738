In article <strnlghtCDy6ns.17A@netcom.com> strnlght@netcom.com (David Sternlight) writes:

Sternlight is of course not aware of the opinion of the Office of Legal
Counsel of the United States Department of Justice. Here's an excerpt:
``In conclusion, it is our view that the existing provisions of the ITAR
are unconstitutional insofar as they establish a prior restraint on
disclosure of cryptographic ideas an information developed by scientists 
and mathematicians in the private sector.''

So, Sternlight, what do you mean when you say that this ``can't even be
argued''? There's no presumption of constitutionality based on the 
alleged competence of the people who write government regulations!

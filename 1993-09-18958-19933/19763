OK, correction accepted.

So, according to you (or to your correspondent), all publishing houses
that publish crypto journals and/or books must register as defense
articles manifacturers?

Such as BYTE, who happened to publish the source of a BASIC program
for DES encryption?

Good. So go tell them about BYTE and Cryptologia, and Cloack and
Dagger Books, etc.

Might be useful to ask them.

I'm trying to. And I am attempting to point you out that either your
understanding of how the law is is wrong, or those who try to
apply this law in this case are wrong, or the law is unconstitutional.

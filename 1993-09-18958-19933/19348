O.K.  Lets say the homebrew secure phone guys want a simple way to
encrypt their messages.  We can use several seconds of handshaking at
the begining of the conversation to exchange public keys, IVs etc, but
the telephony will need to be encrypted quickly on a slow CPU (assume
existance of SoundBlaster or equiv to turn voice into raw data).  DES
is very slow in software.  What should we use?  It seems to me that
compressed voice may make it more difficult to get "probable
plaintext".  Does this make pseudo-random XOR better in a practical
sense?

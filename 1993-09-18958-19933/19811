When opponents to a regulation or law argue against it on constitutional
grounds, they don't say:

  "This regulation should be made unconstituitional. We ask the court to make
  this law unconstitutional."

They say:

  "This regulation is unconstititonal. Please recognize it as such."

For example, in _Doe v. U. of Michigan_, the judge summarizes: "Doe
initially moved for a preliminary injunction against the Policy on the
grounds that it was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad and that it
chilled speech and conduct protected by the First Amendment."

Thus, even the courts recognize that a regulation or law can be
unconstitutional even before a court recognizes it as such.

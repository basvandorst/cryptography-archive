This discussion is going nowhere. I have checked with the FCC and ARRL and
none of them can identify the restrictions you claim existed. You are going
by your memory. Either produce documentation or drop the matter. The issue
at hand, in any case, was whether there are any such restrictions _now_.

  >>I believe the regulations here are written in such a way as to make it
illegal for us to communicate with hams in such countries (indeed, if I
remember right, two of the four in the prohibited list back then were
prohibited solely because the OTHER country prohibited _their_ hams from
talking to _us_).  In any event, it's my understanding that any other
country that bans communications with US hams ends up on that restricted
list.<<


Obviously there may be restrictions in the future, if the appropriate regulations
are created. Regulations banning virtually anything by any agency are always
a future possibility. But those regulations DO NOT EXIST TODAY (if you think they
do, please identify them). CURRENT regulations are the only thing germane
to the analogy between supposed ham radio "restrictions" and restrictions
on encrypted communications (which is where this all started).

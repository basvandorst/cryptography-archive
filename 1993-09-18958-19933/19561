   A good analog to this is gun control.  Although it's already illegal here
to possess a hidden firearm, to carry a handgun without a permit to carry,
and to fire a gun within the city limits, it doesn't stop the criminals from
doing so; making it illegal to possess handguns will have about the same
deterrent effect on the criminals.
   The current purpose of government seems to be to make more laws; it's
easier than addressing the problem at hand.  They (as a group) naively
think that making such a law will be effective at prevention, when in fact
it only has an effect after the crime has been committed.  Thus the popular
statement "When guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns."
   Same thing for crypto.  When crypto is outlawed, only outlaws will have
crypto.
   (PLEASE don't turn this into a gun control flame war in the net... I
welcome discussion in email but would hate to see sci.crypto degrade into
a gun-control group.  I'm only using a practical example for illustration.)

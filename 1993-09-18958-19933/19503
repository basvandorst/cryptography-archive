Well, I read the FAQ and it said that such postings are as meaningless as posting
a burst of white noise. Don't I wish! I promised to post my favorite limerick after 
encoding with my fast, cheap, and dirty 64-bit 8 round block cipher. The tables used
in this instance were constrained to have between 3 and 6 bits different than the
table index. There are 8 such tables, optimized to make the expected number of bit
changes for each table = 4.00. The total encryption time was about 320 microseconds.
There were 129 printable characters in the original message plus 3 line-feed/carriage 
return pairs for a total of 135 characters. The 7 bits ASCII characters were packed
9 to a 64-bit word and were blank-padded (not reccommended in practice). This produced
16 64-bit words for a total of 128 bytes or 256 nibbles..

The eight keys used were (in hex):

b75d2ba3416423a1
912345678165f483
badbeef264aed63e
2ac35b0520c3a1f8
4a6e21a575d2ba34
0a85f8530f489c93
1a2362354aed163e
2ab1f2f274c3a1f8

The encrypted message:

E19D1C5A43E5D044
A78926697CACDDA7
5ACEFBD67A6C3094
AB22708E167AE7B9

And the decrypted message:

The boy stood on the burning dock,
his feet were full of blisters.
he tore his pants on a rusty nail,
and now he wears his sister's.

All but the last line-feed / carriage-return were provided by the decrypted message.
If the bits are really "white" and Independant/Identically Distributed  uniformly,
then we expect to see 16 of each kind of nibble from 0..F. The expected number of 
double bytes is 16 and the expected number of triple bytes is 1. We tabluated the
following occurabces manually:

0       11
1       14
2       12
3       16
4       19
5       15
6       19
7       20
8       14
9       15
a       15
b       14
c       16
d       21
e       15
f       21

22      2
33      1
44      2
55      1
66      3
77      1
88      1
99      1
dd      2
ee      1
ff      4
888     1

The total number of double nibbles found was 21 counting the triple. One triple was
found.

Only if you don't use an initialization vector (IV).  For example, DES (or any
block cipher) in CFB or OFB mode is just a variation of an xor-with-random-
number generator (albeit with some feedback involved).  However the use of 
the IV masks any pattern in the data by producing a completely different 
output data stream even if the same input data and key are used repeatedly,
rendering the known-plaintext attack you describe useless.

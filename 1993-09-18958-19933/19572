A test of whether Austin Code Works is a publisher or a software house
attempting to hide behind the designation of publisher would probably turn
on what their business has historically been. I believe, and the name
confirms this, that they are a software firm. That they print software,
manuals, etc. does not make them a publisher any more than when General
Motors prints the instruction manual for the new Chevvy they stop becoming
an auto manufacturer and start becoming a publisher.

I think Grady's erred badly in picking that particular firm to do his deal.
Had he picked John Wiley or McGraw Hill or the equivalent he might have
gotten away with it.

This "publisher" stuff reads like an after-the-fact attempt to "get out of
it" rather than a genuine circumstance to me, though others may disagree. It
was, in my view, caused by attempting to apply Grady's personal logic to the
regs instead of checking them out with either State or a lawyer with
experience and competence in the crypto/ITAR area. If that speculation is
accurate, it was an act of hubris which is likely to bring the usual penalty
for same.

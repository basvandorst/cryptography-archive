After a dozen requests today, I asked "Michael (M.J.) Wiener" <wiener@bnr.ca>
if his paper could be distributed.  He expected that John Gilmore would
distribute it and agreed, saying it would save him effort answering
requests via email.

I just got permission from mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu (Mark Riordan) to dump
the file des_key_search.ps in one of the incoming directories on 
ripem.msu.edu.  Mark should have the paper installed (under pub/crypt/docs
would be my guess) probably sometime Friday.   For those not willing to
wait it was deposited as /pub/crypt/ripem/incoming/des_key_search.ps, owned
by ftp (anonymous ftp login).

I wasn't able to get a hold of John Gilmore (gnu@toad.com) to find out
why it fell off ftp.eff.org.  I figure he's probably traveling or something.

Hi all!

I asked a couple of crypt questions a few days ago, and got some 
interesting replies.  Thanks!

However, they got me more curious about other topics.  (remember that I 
know virtually *nothing* about cryptology, I just ran across this group
and it piqued my interest)

In my previous question, I was asking about "on the fly" encryption,
and asked if it was very fast.  I was thinking about an ecryped filesystem.
One guy mentioned using encryption over a modem.

How would you do that?  How do you get the encryption "key" to the other
guy (computer?) without transmitting it in the clear?  (thus making
the whole thing worthless)

I.E. I'm a big corporation, and I have people in NYC that want info 
stored in a database in Texas.  I want to be able to log in, then do
queries on this database.  If I want to ensure secrecy by changing the
"key" every call (and perhaps in the middle of a call) how can I do
it?  If I login in plain text ascii, and then use a pre-defined key,
I have to get the key to Texas someway.  Is there an easier way?

How do things like this work?  (is it even possible?)  I saw a post here
about some "zero knowledge" something that seemed reasonable, but I
didn't really understand it.  So, speak s-l-o-w-l-y.  :)  I'm no math
genius, but I understand basic math (up thru differential equations
and stuff).



Thanks!!

Garry

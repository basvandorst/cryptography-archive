You can, however, dither down to 128 colors, replicate the palette,
and put one bit per pixel in the choice of which copy to use.  No
visual noise; banding instead.  The LZW compression sort of gets cut
off at the knees, though.  I did a few test images (using Piclab to
do all of the image-processing work), and they didn't look too bad.
This technique is easily detectable, though.  Mapped-color images
whose palette entries occur in identical pairs, both elements of
which are used, are rather unusual.

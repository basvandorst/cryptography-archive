    Accept this and the battle is over.  As I see it, Austin Code
Works is NOT a manufacturer (or exporter).  In this case Austin Code
Works is a PUBLISHER, and this distinction should be politely pointed
out to the State Department.  It is not clear to me whether or not the
authors of crypto material can be treated like authors of pornography,
but this community must insist on a distiction between manufacturing
software and publishing it.  Otherwise the various assumptions which
make Usenet and Internet possible will disappear.

    A manufacturer of goods gives an implied warrant of
merchantability, a promise that the goods can be safety used for their
intended purpose.  No one with deep pockets could possibly agree to
serving as a Usenet, or even e-mail, feed if doing so opened them to
lawsuit every time a piece of software distributed via the net failed
to work.  (And of course to prosecution for failing to register as a
crypto equipment manufacturer.)

    (All this obviously IMHO.)

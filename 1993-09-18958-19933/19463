From my perspective, Grady is correct in that he should be able to export
his product, since it doesn't include executables (only source), and of a
type that is commonly exported in textbooks and other publications.  I
don't think it's unreasonable to expect the NSA to be consistent in it's
application of it's own 'rules': if it can be exported in _one_ 'format'
(educational), then it should be exportable in another format (commercial
source code) - hence his original request for all manner of other source
code snippets.

Depending on what those objectives might be - if Grady's actions result in
_all_ of us having the freedom he seeks to exercise.....

And implement those rules in a _uniform manner_ (see above), or get rid of
them!

Agreed - I trust I didn't cause any offense.....

In my own opinion, NSA/Customs should have raised their objections to the
export of crypto source code long before this, if they were going to fuss
about it at all, and laid out some _very_ specific rules and definitions of
what was acceptable and not - failing to have done so, my own thoughts are
that they have no valid cause to 'kick' this late in the activities. It's
(roughly) analogous to going 10 MPH over the speed limit past a cop every
day for a year, then having him write you a speeding ticket the day your
headlight happen to shine in his eyes!

Too, this case just might accidentally serve to put the NSA on notice that
while they're in charge of crypto for the U.S., they are _not_ in charge
of all crypto _IN_ the U.S. - in other words, they need to learn some
'manners'. (so does most of the rest of the government, but that's for
alt.gov.nag_and_gripe!)

Finally, I spent 5 years in uniform (USN) from '72-'77 (volunteered, when
it _really_ wasn't 'cool' to be GI), and part of my oath was to uphold and
defend the Constitution from all enemies, foreign and domestic - seems to
me that this kind of heavy-handed activity by NSA/Customs more closely
resembles bullying than friendship; and the last time I looked at the
Constitution, government was supposed to be subject to the citizenry, not
the other way 'round.  Or is the government showing us one Constitution,
and using another for itself?

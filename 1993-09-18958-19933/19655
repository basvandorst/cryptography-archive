I don't know anything about cryptology (except I have heard of 
stuff like DES, IDEA, etc, but no nothing about them) so please
be patient with me...

I have two questions...

1)
How fast is regular ecryption?  Is it fast enough to be done "on the
fly" like v.42bis compression?  What I was wondering...  Would it be 
possible to make an "installable file system" for something like os/2
that did triple DES on the "fly"?  

Here's what I'm thinking..  You boot the os/2 machine, and the first
thing it asks your password.  It uses this as your encryption key
for storing stuff on the hard drive.  You'd have to do it real
early, so that you would keep the swapper on the encrypted drive.
(don't want any of my secret recipe for cookies getting swapped out
to a disk that is in the "clear"!!)  Would it be far far too slow
on a "normal" machine?  (i.e. 486/25 8 or 16meg ram, maybe a 486/50
or something)


2)
Also, if you were wanting to build a dictionary for trying to guess
passphrases, wouldn't it be a good idea to get a regular news feed,
and have one machine that just sat around and got all the words
that anyone posted?  That would get a TON of names, products, etc.
Maybe limit it to words over 5 characters?

Just curious.

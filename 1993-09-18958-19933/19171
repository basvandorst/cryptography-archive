I do hope not. This means that I can no longer break off for a cup
of tea in the middle of my work - I'm still being charged for the
packages that I have running.

The problem is that it's not really a service - no matter how much or
how little you use a package, the s/w house still has to put the same
amount of effort into producing it in the first place (ignoring
supportlines, etc). So charging as though it *is* a service is
probably never going to be accepted so long as there are other choices
available.

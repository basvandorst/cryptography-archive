	From a hardware point of view, there are serious problems.
First, if any kind of Overdrive technology is still in place, are
you going to have to, like when you collect artwork, reserve the serial
number in the production run in case you decide to upgrade?
	Second, what does this mean to multiprocessor machines?
	Third, how are you going to get consensus on the correct way
to implement such a beasty in the chip market?
	Finally, since much protection circumventing takes place by
hacking the code, the CPU hardware thing creates no special advantage.

Mel is correct.  You may have to find a mutual frequency since different
regions of the world may differ slightly in their allocations, and
there may be 'third party' restrictions (usually at the behest of
the local phone company who doesn't want to lose revenue) but amateurs
can talk to fellow amateurs using any of the permitted modes anytime
they want.

I even ran an informal public key exchange net last spring on 20m.
Maybe that got the NSA adrenals a-pumping?

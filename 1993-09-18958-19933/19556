	There are actually a number of factors which seem to make it
fairly to very difficult to make an alternative more attractive to
consumers.

	First the NSA is a large agency with lots of your tax
dollars.  Those tax dollars were spent to develop Clipper with no
requirement that Clipper pay for itself in the marketplace.  Any
'competitor' to the US Government needs to make a profit.  This means
that they have to make back the cost of developing the chip by selling
it, or by selling some other product.  Every American taxpayer has
already paid the development costs of Clipper, putting market driven
companies at a severe, and perhaps insurmountable disadvantage.

	Secondly, it seems unlikely that the NIST will certify an
alternative to the Clipper as a 'standard technology.'  This means
that any alternative is "non-standard."  If it doesn't work with the
(cheaper) Clipper chips, its just not going to be attractive to those
who "don't have anything to hide."

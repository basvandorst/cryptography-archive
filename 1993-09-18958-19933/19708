I think it's naive to believe that the NSA can't pick up the phone and ask
a DA to issue a GJ subpoena. Surely you realize that for the
most part G.J.s act as a rubber stamp for the DA. While nobody can demonstrate
cause and effect with the fax, neither can anyone demonstrate that it's
irrelevant.

The subpoena was sweeping in its requirments, asking for virtually every
business record available: 

   "Any and all correspondence, contracts, payments, and record,
   including those stored as computer data, relating to the
   international distribution of the commercial product "Moby
   Crypto" and any other commercial product related to PGP and RSA
   Source Code for the time period June 1, 1991 to the present."

Since June 1991! This isn't Willford Brimley asking Paul Newman to "stop in for
a friendly chat with the Grand Jury." This is a major imposition on a going
concern, an imposition that I doubt any DA could legally require unless the
subjects were in fact the targets of the investigation. The command is so
broad that I wonder if it's even achievable. No matter what the defendants
(that is what they are in reality) bring in, the govt could find them in
default on some point.

  >>This was criminal behavior (in my view) of a small number of police acting

compensation if the heirs can afford the legal fees (or the ACLU gets
interested). Of course it's horrible, and it won't bring the dead back to
life. But it wasn't a "government conspiracy."<<

  What is government conspiracy, if not "criminal behavior of a small number...
under color of authority"?  Surely a conspiracy isn't going to involve a large
number of people!  Nobody is saying the whole govt is rotten to the core.
But agents of our government conspire to violate our rights all the time.
It is the single reason for separation of the executive and judicial branches;
the founding fathers did not trust governement without controls. 

  It's better that the government realize that this issue is under public
scrutiny already, rather than have everyone wait in silence until "we know all 
the facts."

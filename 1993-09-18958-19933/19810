I am not arguing that "the cipher can't gain any strength".  I'm
arguing that if the cipher is strong enough to use, that the mapping
to ASCII doesn't matter.

OF COURSE the mapping to ASCII is cryptographically useless.  It's not
part of the cipher.  You're trying to make the ASCII mapping become
part of the cipher, by having the mapping be under control of the key.

If you want to claim that DES-plus-Ritter's-RNG-substitution (which
uses 56+64=120 key bits) is more secure than DES by itself (which uses
just 56 key bits), then come out and say so, OK?  

When you design a nice secure cipher, then we can take its output and
map it directly into ASCII with the obvious mapping, right?  Or will
you come back then and ask for another level of substitution?

The regs cannot be unconstitutional only if Junger says so, and to take such
a position seems to me to be the height of arrogance (dunno if he took such
a position, so I don't accuse him of arrogance).

They can only be unconstitutional when a court empowered to make such a
determination says so.

Junger can say "I think if put to a court test they'd be found
unconstitutional" but that's just his opinion. We'd give heavy weight to it
if he's a Professor of Constitutional Law, but otherwise perhaps not. Even
experts, though, are known for quirky opinions. For example, a correspondent
points out that Harvard Law Professor Tribe has some unique ideas on what's
constitutional or not, but so far the courts apparently don't agree with him
(I am told).

It probably can't even be argued that they're prima facie unconstitutional
since government regs are drafted by a General Counsel who doesn't think so
and is presumably professionally competent (if only on the face of his
credentials). Thus it takes a court to throw them out (unless Congress or
the Administration acts).

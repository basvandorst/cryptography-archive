From a hardware side this might be neat, technically. However, from a
software side this would represent a step backwards in licensing,
going from floating network licenses (such as are used with much of
the software I use) back to node-locked licenses with all their
problems.

I would assume the opposite - i.e. by eliminating the threat of
competition from illegal and fair-use copying, this would cause an
increase in software prices. (of course, demand for such
copy-protected software would be less, so maybe prices would drop...)

Random but high-penalty enforcement is very wrong and subject to abuse.  What you get is a situation similar to the way prostitution is enforced when organized crime controls a city government:  the competition is heavily penalized in order to preserve the monopoly held by those in political power. It gives the illusion that gov't is working to get rid of prostitution (or drugs or pollution), while in reality they do the opposite.

For the mathematically inclined, this is a simple application of
the Chinese Remainder Theorem.

Consider the setup where at least e recipients use the common public 
exponent e (this is typical, for instance we tend to use a fixed e of 
3,17,65537 depending upon the application) for a common message M. 
Without loss of generality we may assume that the public moduli for 
each recipient are relatively prime (if not, then we've factored one 
of them!). 

So we know M^e mod n(i) for i=1,...,e  - where M is the message and
                                         n(i) is the modulus for recipient i
let N=product n(i), i=1,...,e

apply CRT to find M^e (note M < n(i), for all i; so M^e < N)

then take the ordinary integer eth root of M^e.

But yes, the pseudo-random padding in PGP, RIPEM and TIS/PEM 
means this sort of attack won't work. 

Still, I think that the use of very small e (say 3 or 17) is unwise.

I'm the one who said he was naive.  I didn't say writing (n.b. one 't')
the Prez was naive, I said emailing was naive.  It is well-known
to most [that] the feed to the email address posted is responded to
automatically and the messages archived, not necessarily read.

Do you somehow think Bill comes into the Oval Office every morning
at 8am, logs on, and reads his email from the Internet?

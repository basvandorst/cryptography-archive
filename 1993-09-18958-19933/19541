The government cannot force a suspect to reveal his encryption key without 
forcing him to do something that may--and that the government hopes will--
incriminate him.  And the fifth amendment to the federal constitution denies 
the government the power to force someone to incriminate himself.  That's 
why defendants were not forced to decrypt the materials (and, unless the 
fifth amendment is repealed--or ignored by the courts--the government is not 
going to be able to force suspects to decrypt their files in the future).

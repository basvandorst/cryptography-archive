[ I posted this to a.s.pgp a month ago, and got zero response, so
  I'm assuming it was due to spotty propagation ... ]

I'm having trouble sending messages encrypted with PGP 2.3 to a
MacPGP 2.2 user; he gets something like "Invalid RSA key block"
or similar.  Is this a known interoperability bug?  Should I be
using a more recent version of PGP on either box, and from where
(I can't FTP, but I can FTPmail)?

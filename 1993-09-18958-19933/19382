	Of course, if you have a specific target in mind, not all of them
will have convenient nuclear reactors nearby.  :-)

	Eliminating interesting strategic targets like dams which may not
be near the target, and assuming the general target is a city, the top of
a skyscraper would be a good one, although there is the problem of getting
the bomb up to the top of the building (not a serious problem assuming the
bomb is small enough to fit into a freight elevator, say).

	If you want an interesting nuclear terrorist target, try the middle
of Silicon Valley, the manufacturing area.  Imagine all those nifty
chemicals released into an aerosol cloud over California.

    It looks like you need to flip through the manual one more time 
yourself <grin>.  The command to look up a key fingerprint is:
    PGP -kvc [userid] [keyring]
 
    PGP -kvv gives you a list of all of the keys in your public keyring 
that includes the trust and validity attributes. 
 
    For those too impatient to read through the manual files, a short 
command summary is available by typing PGP -h.

Doctor Dobb's Journal Sept 1993 page 50, "The Z80180 and Big-number Arithmetic"
by Burton S. Kaliski, Jr. Source code for 512 bit RSA.

Communications of the ACM July 1992 has source for DSA (I know DSA can't be
used for crypto) but references :

"A Cryptographic Library for the Motorola DSP56000" by Dusse and Kaliski from 
Proceedings of EUROCRYPT-90. (May not count as export :^( )

"Implementing the Rivist Shamir and Adleman Public Key Encryption Algorithm 
on a Standard Digital Signal Processor" by Barrett from the Proceedings of 
CRYPTO-86.  They supposedly contain pseudo-code.

How about U.S. patent #4,200,770 and #4,218,582. These are the patents held 
by PKP on RSA.

I've seen several crypto articles in various Commun. of the ACM.

Hope this helps,
Rudy

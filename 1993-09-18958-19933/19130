Software escrow does exist and has for years...

I was working in a software house about 15 years ago (back when 
you could charge thousands a month in RENT on a technical software
package).  Part of the contract stated that source code to the
software would be maintained in machine readable form (in the
company's safe deposit box, I think) and that the firm had a
contractual obligation to release this source code to the customer
(presumably there was a tape with each customer's name on it) 
in the event the vendor filed for bankruptcy (reorganizational
bankruptcy excluded).  Presumably, the bankruptcy trustee and
judge whould honor this contract and the customer woudl get
the code.

I also remember reading of some California company which was
acting as a "software escrow house" for a fee.  Client companies
could place tapes in escrow, to be release to a third party only
under certain conditions (such as the vendor going bankrupt, or
the third party obtaining a court order).  This firm's sales
pitch was that the presence of such an escrow procedure, maintained
by a neutral third party, would reduce the perceived risk of 
buying software from relatively new firms.

I've never heard of dual agent XOR'ed halves for source
code escrow, however.

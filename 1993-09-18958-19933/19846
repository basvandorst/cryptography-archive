     Abuse of "no knock" warrants, in fact any use of no knock
warrants or procedures absent evidence of a crime actively in process
is an unreasonable search.  Taking of property for no other reason
than to prevent the accused from defending himself in court is (IMHO)
an unreasonable seizure.  The government must be very sensitive to
these issues.  An accusation of unreasonable search or seizure, of
course, is not evidence that one occured.  But failure to justify
these tactics, immediately, and in open court is, on its face,
evidence of government conspiracy.  It may only be a conspiracy of
silence, but that can be just as bad as an "active" conspiracy.

     We will see this week whether the Treasury Department is going to
deal properly with the crimes committed by BATF in the Waco disaster.
(I'm not talking about the fire, just the initial shootout. AFAIK,
there was no "no knock" warrant, and no law under which the BATF could
be granted one.)  Anyone want to bet that any criminal excesses are
not all blamed on the agents who died, or that something worse happens
to the higher ups than censure or forced resignation?  I'm not holding
my breath.

   I think the only way to keep people from making hardware that implements
all of the CPU's operations but the copy protection shceme would be to use
the threat of arrest or lawsuit.  Look at how effective CD manufacturers and
the recording industry was at keeping the DAT drives off the market, while
congressional comittees argued what kind of crippling hardware should be
required by law....

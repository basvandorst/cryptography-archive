The context of this thread involved a high-speed DES machine using a
known-plaintext attack.  The plaintext (w/ position in the message)
is just to clue you in when you've got the correct key.  If you have
too little, you'll get a truckload of false-hit keys.  (In reality,
the non-zero blocksize complicates things.)

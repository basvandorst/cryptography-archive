I'm looking for on-line papers on the IDEA cryptosystem.  I know I've
seen an ftp pointer for Chapter 3 of Lai's (I think) thesis which talks
about how IDEA was designed.  If someone has either that paper on-line,
or

  [LAI90] X. Lai, J. Massey, A proposal for a new block encryption 
          standard. EUROCRYPT 90, 389--404, 1990.

I'd really appreciate it if you could send me a pointer.  Thanks!

Where do you GET this stuff?  He who publishes is a publisher.  Entities
enter into new lines of business all the time, with or without
abandoning their previous enterprises.  There's absolutely no basis for
claiming that a particular work would be a "publication" if Company A
produced it, but not if Company B produced the exact same work.

Of course it does--if they produce publications, then they are by
definition publishers, regardless of whatever else they might also be.

If GM publishes manuals or anything else, then they're a
publisher--irrespective of whether they're also engaged in any other
businesses.  There is no requirement that anyone stop being whatever he
previously was in order to become a publisher.

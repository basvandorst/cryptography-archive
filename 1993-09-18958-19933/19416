Summary: Encode true message as soft errors in cover message.

I can't recall seeing it mentioned before, but error-correcting
codes can be used for steganography.  For example, consider an
8mm tape.  Some innocuous cover data are recorded, but the real
message is encoded by deliberately inserting soft errors.  When
read normally, the hardware or software correct the soft
errors.  The true message is recovered from the sequence of tape
blocks with and without soft errors.  Of course, this requires
hardware and software to read and write soft errors.  Since
there can also be unintended soft errors, the true message
itself needs ECC.  A similar technique is possible for CD-ROM.
I have no idea if this technique has any practical use.

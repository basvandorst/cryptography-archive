\begin {complaint}

As a Briton, I find it expensive and inconvenient writing dollar checks.
Sterling cheques, of course, are no trouble.  I have been trying for
almost a year now to get a reply from the publishers to the question
about paying by an alternative method -- VISA for instance.  My snail
mail to them, asking clear and unambiguous questions, has indeed been
replied to.  On each occasion, they sent me a small card giving the
contact address, subscription rates and the information that they accept
checks in US dollars drawn on a US bank.  I have never had anything
which could be described as a personal reply, nor have my questions been
answered.

I have attempted to contact someone at Cryptologia.  The Postmaster at
Rose-Hulman helped me fully and promptly -- to him my thanks.  However,
my email to the contact person was never answered.

\end {complaint}

I've just about given up trying to communicate with these people.  If
anyone connected with Cryptologia is reading this group, would they
please mail me at the address given below and I'll try again.


Good journal, lousy service.

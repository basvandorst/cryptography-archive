A programming language is at least as much a human language as it is a
machine language. The syntax, organization, variable and procedure
names, comments are designed more for people than for computers (who
would be happier with plain machine instructions or p-code).

That computers can understand programming languages should not strip
programming language expression of its First Amendment protection.

If the government can not show a compelling reason for a ban, that ban
is/should be illegal.

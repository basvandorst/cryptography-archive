Counting on a grand jury not to indict when asked to do so by a U.S. Attorney
is like expected a rattlesnake not to bite because you asked it nicely.
On very rare occasions, a grand jury will return a "no bill," but usually, as
one lawyer put it, a grand jury would indict a ham sandwich is asked to. 
This is especially true when the US Attorney can 1) wrap his case in
"national security" and 2) smother the jurors with technical mumbo-jumbo. Don't
bet on the Grand Jury doing the Right Thing.

A grand jury isn't some sort of forum designed at finding the Truth. It's
a closed panel in which the U.S. Attorney is totally in control. Witnesses,
even if they are targets of the investigation are not allowed to have
their lawyers present in the jury room, though they may step outside to
consult them. And other the rules of procedure, a witness is deemed to
have waived his Fifth Amendment rights against self-incriminating testimony
as soon as he or she answers a single substantive question. As a result,
lawyers will almost always advise targets or possible targets to refuse
to answer ANY questions. Forget about the grand jury as a place where you can 
get your story out.

Depending on the nature of an indictment, intent may or may not be an issue.
Generally if the law says thou shalt not and you do, you've violated the law
whatever your intent.

You could have the money manager return a small piece of code required for
the system to run, eg. some decrypt key or missing instructions. To prevent
someone from building an answering machine, returning the same key every
time, the system could request different pieces of info depending on eg.
the time of the day.

I know of one company who tested out a system for a Teletext package where
the installation job tested the installation by making a call to the
company's headquarters, informing about the CPU ID, net address etc.
Unless the headquarter answering machine returned an "OK" message, the
installation job removed a couple essential modules. There was no manual
installation procedure for these modules, so you couldn't get passed
the reporting to the hqs (except possibly through a LOT of hacking).
The answering machine could eg. check a list of registred customers
before accepting the installation. Well, it didn't - the company decided
such strict monitoring would create an unfriendly impression, so they
never put it into commercial life.

In this case the principle was applied once only, not every time the
software is run, but it could easily be extended to that case too. Yet
I think it would be better to place this logic into a SmartCard than
to require online access to some banking account.

   ObNit: If it compresses _much_ it is probably not all that secure.
Many times a .ZIP file can be ZIPped again and show a 1-2% compression.
Also, ZIPping an .ARC file will usually compress it quite a bit.  I
would imagine that several different combinations exist where one method
can compress the result of another method a little bit.
   It's also not hard to write a QCD (quick, cheap and dirty) program to
do a rudimentary frequency count on a file, another good way to check
"randomness" of the cryptext.

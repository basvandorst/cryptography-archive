I've called that new TV program "The Crusaders" (yeah, I know.....), and
suggested that they might be interested in finding out why the NSA is
unfairly trying to prevent someone from making a living in their business.

Maybe if some others were to call or write, too.......

You can call them at 1-800-233-2828

or write to

I've also written both congresscritters, saying "this guy isn't your
constituent, but _I_ am, and are you gonna let NSA beat me up, too?"; PLUS
writing the Prez (president@whitehouse.gov) suggesting a couple of
headlines he can pick from: "Prez Protects Privacy" or "Prez Moves Us
Closer to '1984'".

But what if it isn't?  I mean, it can be compressed, or it can be using 8
bits (latin character sets for example), or whatever.  What if it's a word
processing file, filled with all kinds of values.  There's just no way that
it can work.

This also means that if you use even a stupid XOR encryption before you DES,
your safety goes up.  Doesn't make much sense.

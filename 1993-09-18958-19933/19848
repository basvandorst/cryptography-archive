When?  Most of the time if you have an idea what you are decrypting.
Mail headers,  News headers,  blocks of zeros (ie. encrypted disk
drive), etc.
You might not know exactly what it is, but if you have an idea
what it is,  or if you know it is one of X possibilities, its not
very hard to use the same attack.

if you know a machine can be bought to crack 1 key of your crypto-
system in 1 second would you use that crypto system?

What if....

What if you had two tape recorders, one out in the open and one hidden. 
Then, at the meeting you produce the one recorder and announce 'This
conversation, in an attempt to maintain a strait record, is being recorded.'
Then if hte givernement grabs the one and smashes it or feeds it to that
mean-looking secret service agent, you'd have the hidden one, which
technically they'd know about since you told them, recording
everyingthing, includeing them them smashing the first one.

:-)

Would that work?

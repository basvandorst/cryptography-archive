The above paragraph diverges in important ways from what I recall from my short
career in the big-firm practice of law.  Suppose you desire to take part in a
transaction.   You know (or are told by your lawyer) that there is a federal
agency which purports to have the regulatory authority to prevent the
transaction.  You consult your lawyer who tells you (let us imagine - I don't
know *any* of the parties to the actual transactions here) that it is the
lawyer's considered opinion that the regulations either aren't worth the paper
they are printed on or (more normally) that the lawyer has very good reason to
believe the client would prevail in a challenge to the regs.  The client asks
for a formal opinion letter, law firm spends vast sums of client's money
producing same, which is duly delivered and client does the deal.  Your
ordinary client [i.e. one concerned more with money than making precedents for
civil liberties] hopes that there will no action by the government agency but
acts in relience on the opinion letter.  He does not fail to do the deal
because of the shadow of the court test if he trusts the lawyer.  Thus,
statements from lawyers who know (ie not *me* without lots more research) are
of great value -- they give you the confidence to do the deal.  The critical
point, I repeat, is that if you have good advice saying it's ok, you will do
the deal in the face of the contrary regulation, knowing that you may have to
defend it in court.  This, I submit, is indeed the American way!  Of course, if
you turn out to be "wrong" (court doesn't agree) you take your lumps.  But
that's either bad lawyering/bad business judgment, or just the breaks.  It
doesn't have great moral implications as to your character.  [Contrast the case
of the person who acts _despite_ legal advice that the regulation is valid
and/or the case of the person who neglects to seek legal advice and/or the
person who gets terrible advice.]

Of course, if your purpose were to spark a court test, the above sequence might
be the same anyway....  Willing plaintiffs of this sort are, I think,
praiseworthy: they take a risk to clarify things for the rest of us (think of
all the valuable, good-for=the-economy, commercial activity chilled by a
regulation that is only later found to be unconstitutional.  The horror! The
deficit!

Not if they wanted to sell their products.

Any company that copy protects their products in ANY way basically
limits their sales to a very very very tiny number.  Few people will
be willing to pay for software that would be useless except on one machine
if the company went brike. Few would be willing to buy software that 
simply won't work on a backup machine of their choice.


Any software that is copy protected forever limits itself to a niche
market. Any computer that supports copy protection in hardware limits
itself to a niche market.


Any hardware manufacturer that wants to be a big player (i.e. compete
with Mac an PC clones) will find it impossible with hardware assisted
copy protection.

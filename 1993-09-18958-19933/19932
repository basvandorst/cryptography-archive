A few brave souls point out that a new group is available for
discussing crypto and politics. No one seems very interested except
those of use interested in technical aspects of cryptography. 
It is suggested that all the political discussion move to their
new home. Fine. But since that seems impossible then maybe we
should create a group dedicated to technical aspects and move
ourselves. 

Before saying this has already been considered and it was officially
decided to move the political discussions instead of us, I invite you to
tell me how to accomplish it. Moving us seems more workable.

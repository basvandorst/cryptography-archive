Well, it has been a long wait.  I'll draw you attention back a few years
ago when the differential analysis attack was first publicly 'rediscovered'.
Many folk had been bitching about the 56-bit keys all along, and many
more folk suspected assorted backdoors.  There was some belief that
differential analysis was just the tip of some iceberg of more powerful
techniques which would show how weak DES truly was.

On the other hand, some other folk [at least including me] argued
that the discovery of the differential analysis attack was a quite
strong demonstration of NSA's good faith in this matter.

I observed at the time that it seems hardly coincidental that this
technique "just happens" to be _just_ enough to bring the
difficulty of breaking DES down to only-a-bit-harder than a brute
force key search.  Some coincidence, huh?  Further, the analysis
showed that strength against differential analysis was a VERY
strong function of the choice of the S-boxes and [ta DAHH] the
actual ones used in DES seemed to be as strong as you could get
them.

I bring this up because with the advent of Clipper, many of the
same unfounded "we don't trust you" arguments against NSA are
being brought up again.  It might be worth pondering a moment
that the more we learn about DES, the more it seems that NSA
played it straight-arrow all the way.  At the least, I would think
that this would tranfer the burden to the tell-us-more NSA bashers
to provide _some_ proof or evidence to lend credence to their
paranoia.

>Now - really how serious is this risk.(?)

In the general case it is fairly serious.  It means that all processes
running in the server are at the same (low) level of trust.  Any
disorderly program can bring down the whole server.  Any one who can
install any code has all privilege.  

On the other hand, in any specific case it is easy to compensate for.
For all kinds of reasons, I usually recommend one service per server
anyway.  On commodity hardware it is false economy to try to see how
many services one can run on the same server.  Of course, that is what
Novell was thinking when they decided that it was more important to be
timely to market than to be elegant.

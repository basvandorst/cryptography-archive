To stretch the analogy, one must not so much destroy the lock as replace
it with another lock that will operate the door. The Permissive Action
Link is built so that it is more difficult to hotwire it than it is
to build a new detonator. 

A fair amount of remanufacturing must be done to bypass/replace
the PAL. That work, it is estimated, would take the Ukrainians
a few months to accomplish, should they decide to do so. They
could probably produce crude plutonium bombs faster than that,
but would have to provide their own delivery systems.

So the crypto part of it makes the difference between using them
off-the-shelf and running a mini-Manhattan project to rebuild them.

Kravchuck, the Ukrainian Prime Minister, just agreed to sell "his"
nukes to the Russians for debt forgiveness. The Ukrainian parliament
may not agree. Stay tuned.

Hi,

I've got a unix workstation that is connected to a packet radio network.  I'd like
to be able to log onto it via the radio network, but do not wish to reveal my login
password to anyone monitoring.  Encryption is not an option in this case, so I need
another way for me to log on securely.

I've heard about a couple of different methods people have used.  One involved
inventing a pass phrase and then having the remote system identify characters at
various indexes into the pass phrase in order to log on.  Doesn't sound very
secure for more than a couple of logons.  The other involved generating a large
prime number as a "secret" key and the remote system would prompt the user to
return the remainders when the number was divided by various smaller numbers.
It was this method that I've associated the term "zero knowledge proofs" with.

Unfortunately, my only crypto book (Denning's) contains no references that I
could find to zero knowledge proofs.  I am looking for any references in the
literature describing such systems, as well as references to any existing proto-
cols or actual software implementations of this.  I'd rather not reinvent the
wheel.

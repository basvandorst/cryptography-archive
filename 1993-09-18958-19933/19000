Agreed.  It might have been possible before the microcomputer revolution,
but today.  The same applies to the idea of putting serial numbers inside
CPUs, so they could be checked by the software ... reasonable in the days
when software was actually licensed for use on one particular machine,
but today it would kill any company that attempted to implement such a
stupid idea....unless of course their customers don't have any choice..

No.  

>>They would all want to write software for it.

No.

You see, we would like to stay in business.

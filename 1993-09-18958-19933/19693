That's what they're implying.  Now, if I compile RIPEM or PGP on my workstation,
does that make me a manufacturer of cryptographic equipment?
What if I'm compiling "tr", since it can be used for rot-13?

   You don't HAVE to register. If it turns out you should have and didn't, you

   make a case even if they thought there was one.

Isn't selective enforcement wonderful?  If you're making a Captain Midnight 
SECRET Decoder Ring, or writing a new rot-12 program, and they want to bust you,
now they've got a way to drag you into court with the kind of
expensive legal support you need to defend yourself against a 10-years-in-jail
$100,000 fine felony bust.

Alternatively, you can pay the bucks and privacy cost to become a
registered international arms dealer.  Who knows what lists *that*
will put you on...?


I found another poster's comment interesting which said that arms
dealer registration was originally intended for enforcing the Neutrality Act, 
a set of laws which gives the US government a monopoly on foreign affairs.
Surely the free market couldn't have picked a much worse set of
thieves, murderers, and bozos than the folks the government has chosen
to support in the name of Democratism and Anti-Communism...

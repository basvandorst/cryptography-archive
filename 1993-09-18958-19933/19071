I'll put in a plug for Bruce's book; I've seen drafts of it, and I
think it's quite good.

Until then, and in addition to it, I'm very fond of Davies and Price's
``Security for Computer Networks''.  While it gives a good background in
the mathematics behind important cryptosystems, the strength of the book
is in how to apply and deploy cryptography in real networks.

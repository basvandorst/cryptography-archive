If you are a terrorist and aren't terribly particular about your target
(e.g. "A heavily populated area in the USA", not "the main IRS office" or
"Congress while it's in session"), don't rule out United Parcel Service
or railroad or trucking services as a delivery mechanism.  Set the timer 
and ship it.  An anti-tamper device sets it off if someone tries to 
open it.  Just don't put an accurate return address on it.  You might 
not even have to enter the USA.  If they lose it, it's still probably
in a fairly populated area.

Does Customs screen all packages coming into the USA for radiation?
I hope so.

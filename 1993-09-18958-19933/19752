I'd much prefer a cryptosystem that used uuencode as its ASCII armour. 
If you got a uuencoded file you weren't expecting and you couldn't work
out what it was, you could try decrypting the first block with your
private key to see if it turned into "IDEA_KEY: 1dd9e92634f63" or some
such.  There's no way of telling what a uuencoded message is supposed to
be, and it makes things about a million times harder for anyone who's
looking for encrypted messages.  Clearly, any message that passes every
randomness test once uudecoded is suspicious, since even compressed
output doesn't do that, but this is a very expensive test and it's very
hard to be sure.

Why should people who want to use secure crypto have to announce the
fact to the NSA?  I'd really appreciate a good reply to this.

Just use a 1 hour (or whatever) time to detonate the bomb.

No, but a rented van might! ;)

1kt dirty fusion would be mighty nice for a terrorist if detonated in
New York or LA, wouldn't you say?  I doubt that the military use of
nukes with delivery systems, good yields, etc.. would be of overriding
interest to a terr.

Knowing our government, it probably is syrofoam and they probably do
pay $400,000/cu in! ;)

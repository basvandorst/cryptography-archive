	Geeze.  Sounds like a formula for lots of forgotten passwords.
	I guess that's the price you pay.  

	Question:  Instead of all of these complex password restrictions,
	wouldn't it be easier to offer the alternative of a really, really
	long password?  I mean, it would be a pain to login, sure, but it's
	easier to remember "A step in the right direction, I think." than 
	it is to remember BB9!dgo.  Of course, I'm not suggesting that you
	lose the option of a short, complex word.

	OTOH, this is a *good* policy.  Most of the people I know
	that I *have* managed to convince to change their passwords
	occasionally just switch from one to another to another and 
	then start the process over again with the first PW.

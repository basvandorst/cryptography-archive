This first amendment angle may be interesting to argue, but does it
even apply?

As I understand it, Austin Code Works is not running afoul of the
government for publishing in general...They would be perfectly free to
publish in this country if they would only have registered with the
State Department.  Again as I understand it, registering with the State
department does not necessarily conflict with freedom of speech as long
the State department grants licenses indiscriminately.  (This is
similar to requiring the Klan to register with the local authorities
before conducting a march.)

Austin Code Works may be running afoul of export statutes, regulations,
and treaties.  As far as my limited understanding of things goes, the
first amendment does not guarantee your rights outside of this country
(USA).  As an example, it is illegal for Ham radio operators licensed
only in this country (USA) to communicate with operators in certain
other countries.  This is enforced by the USA in support of treaties
with other nations of the world.  (Is this example a strong analog
to the enforcement of the ITARs?)

At the CardTech/SecureTech show Toshiba showed the "super Visa card."
It was a credit card with a magstripe, embossed numbers, keyboard,
display, calculator, database, challenge/response, and message
authentication.  They were talking prices in the low tens of dollars in
quantities of hundreds.   

Of course the real problem is not users but merchant fraud and
counterfeit ATMs.  By the end of the decade, use of this technology will
be widespread, perhaps even pervasive.  It is hard to remember now but
credit cards have only been around for three decades and ATMs for only a
little more than two.

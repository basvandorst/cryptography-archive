   Note that failure to reveal that a recording is being made,
   depending on the circumstances and depending on the jurisdictions
   involved, may amount to an illegal wiretap and make the hole he's
   trying to get out of just that much deeper.

no.  ecpa-86 only prohibits recordings made without the permission of
either party.  if one party to the conversation consents, then the tap
is legal.  thus you can record your own conversations.

   Covert recordings are tricky; anyone who makes one without
   obtaining professional advice from a lawyer familiar with this area
   of law and licensed to practice in the jurisdiction in question, is
   definitely asking for trouble.

this is a good idea.  get advice.

take a copy of ecpa-86 when  you go to get the advice, too.

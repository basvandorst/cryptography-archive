The defense articles may well classify crypto algorithms and the rest as
defense materials, but in printed form they are *also* publications.

Doesn't matter - if you print something and distribute it (whether for
money or not) you are a publisher (even if the printed material is secondary
to your line of business).  Even if you still want to quibble about that,
the fact that the material is printed makes it a publication.  There may
still be some room to manoeuvre on whether or not electronic media count
as publications, but to my mind a book by any other name would have words
and pictures in it.  And in any case, I seem to remember the words `Free
Speech' being bandied about - a book is not verbal material, but the concept
is similar enough to warrant the same protections being applied...

And here David, you once again resort to ad hominem attacks when someone
disagrees with you.  You do seem fond of claiming postings are forged or
people are not what they claim to be.  It's a pity you feel motivated to
do this - after your recent period of quiescence, followed by a few fairly
neutral postings you've reverted to your previous obnoxious behaviour.  Keep
it up and you'll no doubt hear the hounds baying for your blood again.

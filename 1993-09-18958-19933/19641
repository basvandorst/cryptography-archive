The fact that keeping personal records in Hebrew isn't improper has
nothing to do with whether the use of Hebrew is "common" in any circles,
and it has nothing to do with the availability or abundance of
Hebrew-English translators.  It also has nothing to do with the purpose
in using Hebrew; despite the fact that many Americans seem to think
there's something a little subversive about speaking furriner-talk, it
is in fact quite legal to be multilingual in the US.  You don't need an
excuse, you don't need a license, and you don't need to prove that
anybody else uses the same language.

Bill's example didn't say anything about "ordinariness" and it didn't
say anything about the relative expense of obtaining a Hebrew-English
translation; the whole point of his story, as I understood it, is that
it was the court's problem to figure out how to read the Hebrew records
REGARDLESS of how difficult that problem turned out to be.  I don't know
of any legal basis for requiring personal records to be kept in any
particular form, "ordinary" or otherwise, except for certain specific
situations in which the exact format is spelled out by statute for some
particular kinds of records.  Do you?

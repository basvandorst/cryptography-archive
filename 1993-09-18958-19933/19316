I'll be glad to post the output of my 64 bit algorithm which I have described
here recently. Might I suggest that we all use the same sample phrase?
I would like to suggest my favorite test case taken from a nonsense poem,
learned in childhood:

The boy stood on the burning dock, 
his feet were full of blisters.
He tore his pants on a rusty nail,
and now he wears his sister's.

I might further suggest repeating the example without the trailing period "."
to see what effect changing one text character would have on the encrypted text.
I think that hex encoded output would be appropriate.

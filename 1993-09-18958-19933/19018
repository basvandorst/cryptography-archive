The best voice compression standard available (Fed-Std 1016) runs at
4800bits/sec.  The only problem is that this requires a lot of
processor power; about 17 DSP MIPS, more than a PC can manage.  Even
lower bit rate coders are available; the lowest I've seen is 400
bits/sec!

This question comes up in sci.crypt from time to time.  With our
SDCRYPT, my 486/50 encrypts 300k bytes per second; about 50k bytes
per second on a 386SX/20.  Perhaps this should be in the FAQ.

Incidentally, with the 486, the encryption speed is almost entirely
determined by the memory access time.  A large cache for the expanded
S-box tables would help a lot.

DES chips are gross overkill for telephone rate comms; they can be
used for megabit data rates.  I suppose that in the past, with only 8
and 16 bit processors, dedicated hardware was needed.  There's no
such need any more.

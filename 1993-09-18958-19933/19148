Far be it from me to defend the the NSA in general or Clipper in particular,  
but at his lecture at Confrancisco Diffie gave a reason for this.  If you think  
about it, encryption of unclassified material is a fairly new thing, with  
limitted installed base of equipment.  Thus going to Clipper as the standard is  
of fairly small cost.  OTOH, the government has tens of billions of dollars  
spent on encryption equipment for classified material, some of it considerably  
older than I am.  System migration would be a major expense, at a time when one  
of the prime consumers of classified encryption equipment (the Defense  
Department), has severe budget problems.   I would feel (slightly) more  
comfortable if Clipper was required for all newly fielded classified systems  
that didn't have to interoperate with old equipment, but I certainly wouldn't  
want to foot the bill for swapping out _all_ of the old cryptosystems.

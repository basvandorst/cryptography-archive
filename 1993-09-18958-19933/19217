Just make up an unique answer to the question "What's your mother's
maiden name?" and give it to them, then all you have to do is remember
what answer you gave to who.  Careful, don't use this with the
government or on a loan application as that can be considered purgery!
For example, I told AMEX that my mother's maiden name was "Chevy Nova"
and they took it and use it.

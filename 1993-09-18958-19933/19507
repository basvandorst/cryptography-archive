It would seem, IMHO, that the point is not whether or not there is a
backdoor to the clipper chip, but whether there are alternative 
"chips" (or software) that perform the same function and don't have
backdoors. Political backdoors are no different. Technical and 
political considerations are rendered solely on the availablility
of alternatives.

*****

Unless there is a real and present danger of the clipper
chip becoming the ONLY encryption device available to consumers then
objecting to the clipper chip is more or less an academic exercise.
If there is at least one alternative technology then the value of the
clipper chip diminishes drastically. This is not to diminish the 
significance of our right to privacy etc.

The clipper chip, to the best of my limited knowledge, would be installed
in devices which transmit and receive digital data (phones, faxes, computers,
etc.). 

The value of these chips will be assessed by the consumers who choose to 
pay extra for the inclusion of this chip in these devices. While this
chip may be a national standard, TTBOMLK, there is nothing preventing a
competitor from producing a rival chip which may be more attractive 
to consumers.

Whether or not the clipper chip is present in a communications device, again
TTBOMLK, does not prevent consumers from installing additional devices in
the data stream that perform a similar function yet rely on different keys
(i.e. a competing standard with no key-escrow). The consumer would then have
the clipper-chip data stream pre-processed by the, e.g. PGP, competing 
encryption standard. On the receiving end, the clipper chip decodes and passes
its output to the competing standard's chip/software.

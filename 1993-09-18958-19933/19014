Gosh, i have such a big collection of dongles that i just don't know what to
do with all of them.

Unix, like any decent operating system, tries to dissuade people from using
machine-specific information or directly accessing hardware devices.  If
people are determined they can get around this, and my only regret is that
there's often a couple years delay before they get burned.

Sun blew nothing.  PROMs are specific to a machine type and this should be
obvious.  The only ones who should be looking at them are the monitor and the
operating system.  Also, a CPU serial number is supposed to be unique to a
machine; otherwise what's the point.

If someone tells you to pull chips out of your machines to make their software
work, he should be told where to stick his software, and IMHO the guy that
decided on such a scheme should be fired.

There's a big difference between a ROM and an encryption chip.

I'd like to have chips for lots of things.  Off the top of my head, i could
use chips for multi-precision math (for both math and encryption), FFT and LPC
analysis (for audio or video compression), HMM beam search (for speech
recognition or cryptanalysis), MPEG decompression, image processing, IDEA
encryption, custom encryption, statistical cryptanalysis, and much more.

Nowhere on this list is having secret bits in my machine, plus hardware
dedicated to trying to prevent me from getting at them.

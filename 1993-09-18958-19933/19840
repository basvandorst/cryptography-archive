There are significant differences.  Michael Weiners research and paper
was done outside US jurisdiction by 2 Canadian Nationals (Mike and his
wife).  Importation of said has no restrictions.  (22 CFR 120.18, 27 CFR
47, 178, 179) I don't expect much would be different if the Weiner's were
US Citizens.  MIchael "waved no red flags" before, during or after the
presentation.      There is no trend.   The comparison is non-sensical.

As far as the other activities:
Playing by "the rules" is not implicitly enforceable, accepting
concequence for one's actions is.

Wether you like the "rules" or not,  they are there, and are
understandable.  


Consider "Security Experts":  Shouldn't they understand attacking any
entity  (USG) at an acknowledge strong point (CFR's)  is foolhardy at
best, sucidal more likely?   Other approaches ("attacks"?) would have
been more effective and productive for all concerned.  One thinks someone
failed/skipped Security 101 and 102.

I expect Messers. Zimmerman and Ward are in for some expensive lessons
and periods for reflection.

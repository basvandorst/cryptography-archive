I think that someone is getting confused.  The nominal 56 kbps
is base ISDN, mostly because it is the minimum for digital voice
at telephone quality.  There are (or at least have been) modems
that can get you up that fast, but they use dozens of simultaneous
frequencies to move a lot of bits at once.  They also degrade 
gracefully in the event of bad connections.  Most modem move data
at a real rate of 9600 or 14.4K because that is a good match
with an "average" quality connection.  The degree of compression
of one's data depends a lot on how well the compression algorithm
can predict the data stream.  Encryption (as we all know) destroys
the entropy of the raw data, so one should always compress before
encrypting.  Most compression methods designed for voice (u-law
comes to mind) get excellent ratios because they predict voice data
so well.

I use a secure phone fairly often, and there is about a half-second
delay (I've called from one secure phone to another in the same
room and guess-timated).  I guess that the phones use compression
and DES chips and a relatively low speed modem.  I don't know if
they packet-ize the data, I expect they send out a steady stream.
CLIPPER is supposed to packet-ize, but I don't know the packet
size.  I would guess that it would have to be a tenth of a second
or so at whatever baud rate they are using.

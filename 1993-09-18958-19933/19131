   What's needed is a digital signature system which can operate on a
   representation of an image, and will allow a strictly limited amount
   of error in the image, enough to handle the errors inherent in scanning.

That sounds equivalent to the following two problems
1) generating a digital hash of an analog signal that allows some measure of
distance between two signals to be computed from the hash values,
i.e. you can say "this hash is/isn't acceptably close to the document's hash"
2) digital signatures on the hash

Decomposing it in that manner allows us to separate the already-well-studied
signature-related cryptography problems from the hashing-analog problems.
There is probably still room left to do some research here :-)

Alignment error is probably much nastier than quantization error,
since distance measures can help gloss over quantizations.
Another serious problem is with distance-measure systems is forgery -
just as it's easy to forge a message with a specific value of CRC-based hash,
it's probably computationally easy to forge a message with most other
error-tolerant hashes as well.  MD-5 and other cryptographic hashes
avoid this problem, but at the expense of making every bit very
significant in ways that make it not error-tolerant.

Since the earlier posting, we've heard elsewhere that Phil Zimmerman has 
also received a subpoena.  I believe that *his* goal which was to spread 
the use of strong crypto was certainly achieved.  Debate on this topic is 
also more vigorous than it was before PGP (which was another goal).

Unless those being prosecuted are judgment proof.   I would urge all those 
undertaking such hazardous activities to make themselves judgment proof in 
advance.  It makes things much more relaxed when facing the Feds.

Many people have been anxious to test the status of crypto as a munition 
and the First Amendment protection of source code and software for a 
long time.  There will be no problems obtaining money to mount a strong 
defense.

The Feds case against Phil will be rough because he took pains not to 
actually export PGP and hasn't written code for many releases.  Also if 
Phil is to be busted for not taking steps to prevent the export of PGP, 
NIST should be busted for not taking steps to prevent the export of 
the DES.  Nets and export controls don't mix well.  Criminal convictions 
require "proof beyond a reasonable doubt and to a moral certainty" which 
is hard to establish when the defense can demonstrate how children can 
export software for "free" in 2 minutes without even breathing hard.

My point about being judgment proof.

Who personally thinks that the possession of strong crypto is protected by 
the *Second* Amendment.

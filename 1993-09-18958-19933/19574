That's one interpretation. Another, and the one the government is far more
likely to make, is that since export is illegal, by seeking a foreign
distributor Grady is attempting to circumvent U.S. law. That's perhaps far
more serious in the eyes of some prosecutors than an export or intent to
export due to misunderstanding of the law, which ceases as soon as the law
is explained to him (in this case to Austin by the State Dept.) It also puts
paid to the defense that there was no intent to export--it seems to me to be
clear proof of intent to circumvent the law.

Given the facts of the case, this is, IMHO a very poor one for EFF, CPSR,
ACLU or any other public interest group to make a stand on. A far better
one, with cleaner hands, could be constructed if there was intent to
challenge the law by such a group.


One man's opinion.

Actually, the engineering demo bomb is a bit larger than that, it's 
in a container that looks like a section of corrugated pipe in a 
pipe rack.  It's designed to be "man portable" if you accept that a
160 pound (70kg) anything is portable.  All in all it looks quite a 
bit like a portable generator.

The smallest I've ever seen (in original case, anyway) was a bit
bigger than that, and designed to be fired from an 8" (20cm) artillery
piece.

Both of the above are on display in the only museum devoted to the
fission and fusion bomb: the Sandia Atomic Museum.  They cover the
history of the atom bomb from it's design in northern New Mexico,
initial detonation in southern New Mexico to it's current forms.
Original cases are used in most displays (mostly because it's easier
to grab one from salvage than to make up a fake) along with additional
neat displays on delivery systems (SubRoc, ballistic systems, lifting
chutes, etc.)

The museum is in New Mexico and is open weekdays during business hours
and weekends 9-4 (or something like that).

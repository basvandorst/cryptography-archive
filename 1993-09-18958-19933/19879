The thing about faxing is, indeed pretty absurd.  I'm sure the only
person whose computer-literate at the company is some guy who set up
the BBS (or Internet gateway, or whatever it was).

As to credit-card numbers, though, it's a little silly for you, as
cardholder, to worry much about them.  Even if someone *does*
illegally intercept and use the number, all *you* have to do is call
your credit-card to get the charges cancelled.  The company won't be
too happy about eating the charges... but it's not really your
problem.  There may be limits, of course, to how careless you can be
with your number... maybe if you take out a billboard with your
cardnumber and the text "Not *my* problem" the company won't think too
highly of covering the forged charges... but sending by email is
certainly reasonable caution.

Yours, Lulu...

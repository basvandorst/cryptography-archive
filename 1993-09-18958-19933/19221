Yes, I have done so in several implementations. I got the idea from Andrew
Tannenbaum. The great thing about the procedure is the the questions ca
be phrased to suggest a particular class of answer is called for when in
fact, one wants a different answer.

Example:
	Q:What did Mrs. Ginsberg teach?

Crackers might try strings like "Math", "Social Studies", whatever. But the
correct answer would be:

	A:4th Grade

	(artificially easy example for clarity, anyone can think up 
         infinitely tougher ones)

The trick is to have the user enter 5-10 Q/A pairs, with verification on
the answers since they're not echoed. 

Also, people like it a lot more than passwords because it's so easy to remember
long strings without those strings being easily vulnerable to dictionary
style attacks.

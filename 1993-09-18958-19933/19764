Hm. Correct me if I am wrong, but it is my understanding that DES is
not just a susbstitution cypher. It is a production cypher, using both
substitution and transposition. Transposition cyphers are weak,
substitution cyphers are weak, but a production of the two may be
strong. That said, I agree with your argument that substitution on a
random-looking data should be strong enough.

But that assumes some additional secure communication, in order to get
the substitution table. It cannot be sent together with the message -
unlike the secret-key encryption method, the secret key itself, and
the ID of the recepient. And the PEM specifications should be also
suitable for e-mail - you must not always assume the ability to
contact your correspondent on-line, in order to get the b-to-a
substitution table or something like that...

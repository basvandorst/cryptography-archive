That is certainly the theory.  Unfortunately I think there are a couple
of links in the chain missing.  Perhaps

	money -> political donations -> flash campaign -> votes -> ....

For a yet more cynical analysis read Noam Chomsky on the role of

Yes government agencies will eventually be got to obey US law but
getting any changes through that might threaten establishment interests

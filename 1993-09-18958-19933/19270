	I was told that someone posted information on a digital phone
product using a PC and phonecard with modem here within the last two weeks
or so. If so, could someone send email me the information, or repost.

	I have a fast PC (66 MHz 486) and a 14K+ modem and a sound card..
(well two, but willing to get another if needed). I've seen posts here
about how voice comunication with simular setup is not possible.. and I
find it hard to believe.

	It seems that such a product would use the sound card to
continuously digitize voice to a circular buffer (maybe there are cards to
do this CPU independent, or by using DMA) and the last (say) 1/10 of a second
would be packaged and transmitted. 

	At the same time (maybe this 'at the same time' is the problem)
the other users last 1/10 of a second would be pulled off the incoming
stream and sent to the the output channel of the soundcard.

	I work with D/A A/D cards and do something a lot like this using
DMA channels and buffers. Maybe my understanding of what is required for
good sound is poor.. In which case let me know! Thanks In Advance

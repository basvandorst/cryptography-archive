Hello to all, below is a message I was asked to pass on. The question 
is about real-time encryption via phone lines using a home computer. 
David only has Email access to Internet so please reply direct to him.

My access is E-mail only.  No newsgroups or FTP, at least not in
any practical way.

While a voice grade line is nominally 56 kbps (actually, 64 kbps,
but they "rob" 8 kbps for framing when it's used for voice), some
digital standards in common use were smaller.  by using fewer
"levels" in the sampling, 38 kbps was actually used for some loop
systems.  Thus, I assumed that this is practical.  (the way they
got 64 kbps, is by taking 4khz voice grade, sampling at 8 khz
(double) which can be shown to be all that's needed, and sampling
at 8 bits per sample.  8x8kbps = 64 kbps).

So, at some reduction in fidelity, you have 38 kbps to encrypt,
which just happens to be the maximum that can be pushed through a
v.32 (9600) modem with 4:1 compression (v.42 bis).  (or, you
could possibly push 56 kbps through a v.32bis modem (14.4) at
4:1) assuming the stream will actually compress that much, or
that you can compress it that much before encrypting and pushing
it through the modem.

So, that's the bandwidth requirement.  How quickly can one
encrypt (or compress and then encrypt)?  What hardware is needed
to keep up with  38000 to 56000 bits per second input in real
time?

Secure phones use a dedicated DES chip, so they are doing it in
hardware, which is faster than doing it in software.  Unless, of
course, the software is running on much faster hardware.

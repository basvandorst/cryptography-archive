Warranty:
        There is none.  Use this software at your own risk. It has been
tested as much as possible to ensure proper operation and contains no 
known bugs.  However, use of this software remains "at your own risk"...

Why:        
        PGP For Idiots! is shareware software that was developed to 
assist the user of Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) by Phil Zimmerman.  While
PGP is very effective for the safeguarding of information, it CAN be
difficult to use.  PGP For Idiots! is our attempt to make this excellent
encryption method available to all computer users, regardless of their
level of skill.

What IS it?
        PGP For Idiots! is a DOS-based program which is referred to as
a "shell" or "front end" program.  It provides you with a menu for the
commands of PGP and allows you to execute thopse commands from within 
PGP For Idiots!  It has been tested in MS-DOS, Windows 3.1, Windows 3.11,
Windows 95 and Desqview.

How to use it:
        PGP For Idiots! should be placed in your PGP directory.  Before 
attempting to use PGP For Idiots! you should have completely installed
PGP according to the documentation it comes with.  PGP For Idiots! will
NOT work without PGP!  I repeat: PGP For Idiots! will NOT work unless 
you have CORRECTLY installed PGP on your computer!

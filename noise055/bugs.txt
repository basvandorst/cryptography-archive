Potential bugbears:

        Possible problems when run under QEMM (although this may have
        to do with other software on the system not being able to coexist
        with NOISE.SYS while under QEMM).

        Since the clock drift sampling uses the BIOS Event Wait timer on
        a continuous basis, there may be conflicts with other programs
        that also use the timer.

Reporting bugs:

        Feel free to study the source code and look for bugs or poor
        implementations that I may have missed.

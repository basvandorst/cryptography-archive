solve-vigenere.tar.Z contains a few simple programs for
classical cryptanalysis.

solvevig helps you break so-called Vigenere periodic substitution
ciphers by trying all the words in a dictionary you supply.
It has a lot of command line options, but it's not a cryptographically
sophisticated program.  It will look at both single-letter
& optionally digram frequencies.

alfaonly is a very simple program that filters out all
non-alphabetic characters and maps letters to lowercase,
as preparation for input to builddig.

builddig allows you to build and update tables of digram
(two-letter pair) frequencies.  The resultant files can
be used in solvevig, though solvevig does a pretty good
job based in just single-letter frequencies.

    PGP v. 2.0 is gradually making its way out into the electronic world.  It
has been posted to the FidoNet Software Distribution Network and should up on
many if not most Canadian and U.S. nodes carrying SDN software.  Sorry: not on
FidoNet nodes outside the U.S. or Canada yet; U.S. crypto export laws are
strict and their enforcement is humorless.  (Odd that U.S. export laws treat
Canada as part of the U.S., eh?  Jumping the gun by a few years there, aren't
we?)  Look for a local node near you. On the Internet, there are many sites
to try for anonymous ftp:
    
    nic.funet.fi  (128.214.6.100)
        /pub/unix/security/crypt/pgp20.zip
        /pub/unix/security/crypt/pgp20src.zip

    van-bc.wimsey.bc.ca  (192.48.234.1)
        /pub/crypto/PGP-2.0/pgp20.zip
        /pub/crypto/PGP-2.0/pgp20src.zip

    ftp.uni-kl.de  (131.246.9.95)
        /pub/atari/incoming/pgp20.zip       (Atari binary)
        /pub/atari/incoming/pgp20src.zip

    ghost.dsi.unimi.it  (149.132.2.1)
        /pub/crypt/pgp20.zip
        /pub/crypt/pgp20src.zip

    gate.demon.co.uk  (158.152.1.65)
        /pub/ibmpc/pgp/pgp20.zip

    qiclab.scn.rain.com   (147.28.0.97)
        /pub/mail/pgp20.zip

    pc.usl.edu   (130.70.40.3)
        /pub/msdos/crypto/pgp20.zip

    leif.thep.lu.se   (130.235.92.55)
        /pub/Misc/pgp20.zip

    goya.dit.upm.es   (138.4.2.2)
        /info/unix/misc/pgp20/pgp20.zip

    tupac-amaru.informatik.rwth-aachen.de   (137.226.112.31)
        /pub/rz.archiv/simtel/msdos/MSDOS_UPLOADS/pgp20.zip

    ftp.etsu.edu  (192.43.199.20)
        /aminet/util/crypt/PGP20amiga.lha   (Amiga binary)

    princeton.edu  (128.112.128.1)
        /pub/pgp20/pgp20.zip
        /pub/pgp20/unix_pgp20.tar.Z  (compressed tar file for Unix sites
            lacking an implementation of unzip.)

    pencil.cs.missouri.edu  (128.206.100.207)
        /pub/crypt/pgp20.zip
        /pub/crypt/pgp20src.zip
        /pub/crypt/pgp20src.tar.Z  (compressed tar file for Unix sites
            lacking an implementation of unzip.)

    For those lacking ftp connectivity to the net, nic.funet.fi also
offers the files via mail.  Send the following mail message to
mailserv@nic.funet.fi:

    ENCODER uuencode
    SEND pub/unix/security/crypt/pgp20src.zip
    SEND pub/unix/security/crypt/pgp20.zip

This will deposit the two zipfiles, as 15 batched messages, in your mailbox
with about 24 hours.  Save and uudecode.

You can try to get PGP 2.0 via email from:

    listserv@spectrx.saigon.com

Send a statement:

    /PDGET  /public/msdos/pgp20.zip [UUENCODE | XXENCODE]

This is a small DOS Waffle machine in San Jose, CA (not Vietnam).

    PGP20.ZIP is available in the UNIX and IBMPC RoundTables on the commercial
service, GEnie.  Search for "PGP" or "Privacy" or for uploads by "ANDY" (Andy
Finkenstadt, GEnie UNIX sysop/manager, to whom many thanks!)

    Both PGP20.ZIP and PGP20SRC.ZIP are available from Exec-PC in Milwaukee,
one of (if not *the*) largest private BBS's in North America. They're available
in the Mahoney IBM Compatible MS-DOS collection. The 2400b number there is
(414)789-4210.  From there it should spread pretty rapidly across the BBS
landscape of the U.S. and Canada, parallelling the FidoNet diffusion.

    Both PGP zipfiles have also been uploaded to BIX (Byte Information
Exchange).  To download them:
    After signon, type "LISTINGS"
    Select option "1"  (category)
    Type "SECURITY"
    Select option "6"  (download)
    Type "PGP20.ZIP" (or "PGP20SRC.ZIP")

    The Northern Lights BBS in Troy, NY, has both PGP20.ZIP and the source
code, renamed to pgp20src.tar.Z for compatibility with Unix, for free download.
Call (518) 237-2163 at 300-2400 bps 8N1 24 hours a day. Then login directly to
the pgp account as follows:

	tnllogin: pgp
	Password: key

and help yourselves.  Thanks to Daniel Ray of tnl for this fine service.

    Another private BBS from which you can obtain PGP for the simple price of
the long-distance call time is the Grapevine BBS, the largest BBS in Arkansas.
It's run by John Eichler in Little Rock.  He sent me the following information
for your edification and enlightenment:

>   The GRAPEVINE BBS in Little Rock is the largest BBS in Arkansas.  To

    Good news!  PGP has been ported to the Apple Macintosh (a nontrivial
feat)!  The following note is from Zig Fiedorowicz, the implementer:

    "A Macintosh port of PGP 2.0 has been placed in the
    /mac/util/encryption directory of mac.archive.umich.edu.  It has a
    modest Macintosh interface. It has not been tested extensively and
    should be considered a beta version. Bug reports are welcome.  More
    work on MacPGP is planned and later versions will be more widely
    distributed." --Zig Fiedorowicz (zigf@mps.ohio-state.edu)

    The Mac version has also been posted at the following sites:

    plaza.aarnet.edu.au
        /micros/mac/umich/util/encryption/macpgp2.0.sit.hqx

    pencil.cs.missouri.edu
        /pub/crypt/macpgp2.0.sit.hqx

    wuarchive.wustl.edu
        /mirrors3/archive.umich.edu/mac/util/encryption/macpgp2.0.sit.hqx

    src.doc.ic.ac.uk
        /computing/systems/mac/umich/util/encryption/macpgp2.0.sit.hqx.Z
                                                     

    If none of these sites do it for you, let me know.  Film at 11.

    Best regards!
    -=- Hugh

P.S.:  If you come across sites where it's posted -- especially FREE ACCESS
sites -- please drop me a line (info-pgp-request@lucpul.it.luc.edu).
I'd like to maintain a current list as part of a PGP FAQ list.  Thanks!

P.P.S.:  This will be the last revision of the sites message until the
appearance of version PGP 2.1, expected sometime in the next few weeks.

Given:
  p -- large prime number
  q -- large prime number
  e -- number relatively prime with respect to (p-1)(q-1)
  d -- number such that 1=de mod (p-1)(q-1)
  n -- pq
  x -- some random positive integer less than n ("plaintext")
  y -- n|x^e ("cyphertext")
 
Signifying a mod b with b|a, and ab with a*b, and performing
calculations from right to left with no precedence rules .. the
sequence:
 n|y*n|y*n|y*n|y*n|y*n|y*n|y*n|y*n|y*...n|y*n|y*n|y*n|y*n|y
with y repeated for d occurances will produce x as a result.  This is
only guaranteed to work for a number d selected as described above.
 
However, looking at the result of intermediate n|... calculations
above, x will occur as an intermediate result some k times where k is
a factor of (p-1)(q-1).  The interval between these occurances will be
j where jk=(p-1)(q-1).
 
This suggests the potential viability of a hill-climbing algorithm to
determine factors of (p-1)(q-1), which may in turn lead to a
factorization of n.
 
Alternatively, this property might be directly exploited, especially if:
 
(a) the probability of the revelation of plaintext is significantly
higher than the probability of factorization, and
 
(b) some technique is available (statistical analysis or knowledge of
the form of the plaintext) to recognize a plaintext when it appears.
 
I presume that this property of RSA has been discussed in the
literature -- however, I've not been able to find any such
discussion.  Does anyone know of any literature on this topic?

Well, right -- this is a brute force attack.  Just keep trying every
value until you find it.  Of course this is going to work, since you
have a finite space in which to search.  The problem is that the size
of the numbers here make this approach prohibitive.
 
   However, looking at the result of intermediate n|... calculations
   above, x will occur as an intermediate result some k times where k is
   a factor of (p-1)(q-1).  The interval between these occurances will be
   j where jk=(p-1)(q-1).
 
This is a perfect reason why you want "good primes" -- choose p
and q such that p=p1*p2+1, or something like that (I forget the
actual equation offhand).  This forces phi(n) such that given e
there are only two possible values for d, which maximizes your
search space.
 
   This suggests the potential viability of a hill-climbing algorithm to
   determine factors of (p-1)(q-1), which may in turn lead to a
   factorization of n.
 
Again, this is a brute-force method.  If there are only 2 values for d
that will work, then you are looking for two values out of what?
2^|n|?  Ok, so you have a 1 in 2^|n|-1 chance in finding the value.
The time it would take to search this space makes it prohibitive,
since the search space is practically flat.

Let's look at the magnatude of the numbers involved.  I'll assume
that n is approximately 300 digits long, being composed of a
140 digit p and a 160 digit q.  If our public e is about 100 digits
long, we should expect our private d to be about 200 digits long,
since (p-1)(q-1) is about 300 digits, e*d must be greater than
(p-1)(q-1), and e should be less than (p-1)(q-1).  So to directly
search for d by the long equation above would take prohibitively
long.  (The calculation of e**x mod n is usually done by much
faster techniques such as repeated squaring.)
 
So the question becomes: is j small enough that a search is feasible?
The answer depends on whether (p-1)(q-1) contains small factors.
If the smallest factor of (p-1)(q-1) is, say, 25 digits, then
searching for an instance of x is not feasible.  If the smallest
factor is about 6 digits, then this approach holds the potential
of being feasible.
 
This argues for the reinstatment of the guideline for choosing
n that (p-1)(q-1) should not have small factors.

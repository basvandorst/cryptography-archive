Differences between gmp and fmp

1. fmp is considerably slower than gmp
2. fmp does not implement the following:
	all mpq_*
	internal mpn_* functions
	mpz_sqrt
	mpz_sqrtrem
	mpz_perfect_square_p
	mpz_inp_raw, mpz_out_raw
	mp_set_memory_functions
3. fmp implements the following in addition to the routines in GNU gmp.
	int mpz_jacobi(MP_INT *a, MP_INT *b)
	- finds the jacobi symbol (a/b)
4. mpz_sizeinbase often overestimates the exact value

5. To convert your gmp based program to fmp (subject to the
above), change includes of gmp.h to fmp.h and link in fmp.o 
instead of libgmp.a

These directories contained contributed mailer scripts.  If your
mailer is not included here, or you don't like the scripts provided,
please feel free to submit new ones.  They'll go out with the next
release.

Except for the md5sum utility (which generates and checks cryptographic
checksums of files), and the idea directory (which contains some high-speed
80x86 IDEA code that has not yet become part of PGP), we do not vouch for
any of these utilities.  They looked useful to us, and we hope they are to
you, but most are untested.

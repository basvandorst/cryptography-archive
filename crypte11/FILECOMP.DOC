WHAT IS THIS?

FILECOMP.EXE is a file comparison utility that does a byte for byte comparison
of two files.  Unlike the MS-DOS FC command, this program will compare two
files of different lengths to see if they are the same up to the end of the
shortest file.  It is also faster than the MS-DOS version.

I originally wrote this program while working on CRYPTMPJ -- the file
encryption program -- when I noticed that the MS-DOS file comparison program
was not only inadequate, it was not even present in all versions of DOS.

To use this program to compare two files, simply enter the names of the files
on the command line.  For example to compare THIS.TXT and THAT.TXT, type:

FILECOMP THIS.TXT THAT.TXT

If the two files are the same, the program will tell you that.  If the
programs are not the same length, but they are the same up to the end of the
shorter file, the program will report that "The first XXX bytes of THIS.TXT
and THAT.TXT are the same."  (XXX would be the length of the shorter file). 
If the files are different, the first few differences will be shown.  There is
no attempt to resynchronize, but by looking at the differences shown, you will
see if there is just a missing character, or if the files are totally
different at that point, or what.

ENJOY!

PGP MENU
~~~~~~~~
PGP menu is a simple utility to allow easy use of PGP from within CppNews (or
any other program that allows you to shell out to an editor as you prepare 
your text).

PGP menu does not currently support mail programs than allow the user to 
edit the header and text of a message (e.g. View).

The program will offer to remove any existing signature on your file (useful
for editing outgoing mail), then call up your editor, to allow you to edit 
your text message, and finally prompts you to allow you to sign, encrypt or 
sign & encrypt (both) a file.

Known Bugs / Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.  The program will always use default key for encryption of your message
		(i.e. the key specified by 'MyName' in %PGPPATH%\config.txt).
	
2.  There is currently no way to specify the encryption flags.

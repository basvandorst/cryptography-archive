For Immediate Release                        April 16, 1993


		 STATEMENT BY THE PRESS SECRETARY


The President today announced a new initiative that will bring 
the Federal Government together with industry in a voluntary 
program to improve the security and privacy of telephone 
communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law 
enforcement.

The initiative will involve the creation of new products to 
accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure 
telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.

For too long, there has been little or no dialogue between our 
private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the 
tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of 
protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate 
the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and 
law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against 
industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.

Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to 
protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to 
protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption 
technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the 
unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used 
by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.

A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the "Clipper Chip" has 
been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a 
new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new, 
relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to 
an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications 
using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in 
commercial use today.

This new technology will help companies protect proprietary 
information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations 
and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted 
electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the 
ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to 
intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. 

A "key-escrow" system will be established to ensure that the 
"Clipper Chip" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding 
Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique
"keys," numbers that will be needed by authorized government 
agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the 
device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately 
in two "key-escrow" data bases that will be established by the 
Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to 
government officials with legal authorization to conduct a 
wiretap.

The "Clipper Chip" technology provides law enforcement with no 
new authorities to access the content of the private 
conversations of Americans.

To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the 
Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new 
devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the 
government will be offered access to the confidential details of 
the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report 
their findings.

The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of 
encryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the 
privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield 
criminals and terrorists.  We need the "Clipper Chip" and other 
approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access 
to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it 
to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology 
trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system), 
the President has directed government agencies to develop a 
comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:

	  the privacy of our citizens, including the need to 
	  employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;

	  the ability of authorized officials to access telephone 
	  calls and data, under proper court or other legal 
	  order, when necessary to protect our citizens;

	  the effective and timely use of the most modern 
	  technology to build the National Information 
	  Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and 
	  the competitiveness of American industry in the global 
	  marketplace; and 

	  the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export 
	  high technology products.

The President has directed early and frequent consultations with 
affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the 
privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.
The Administration is committed to working with the private 
sector to spur the development of a National Information 
Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer 
technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to 
information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks 
("information superhighways") will transmit video, images, HDTV 
programming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone 
system transmits voice.

Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important 
role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act 
quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding 
its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that 
protect all American's right to privacy while also protecting 
them from those who break the law.

Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet.  
The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new 
encryption technology are also available.

Standards and Technology, (301) 975-2758.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S
TELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE

Q:   Does this approach expand the authority of government
     agencies to listen in on phone conversations?

A:   No.  "Clipper Chip" technology provides law enforcement with
     no new authorities to access the content of the private
     conversations of Americans.

Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on
     a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation
     encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to
     decipher the message?

A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a
     court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They
     would then present documentation of this authorization to
     the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and
     obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug
     smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are
     stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key
     escrow system.

Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?

A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent
     entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the
     Administration have yet to determine which agencies will
     oversee the key-escrow data banks.

Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure
     how strong the security is?  

A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption
     systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will
     remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow
     system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of
     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all
     potential users that there are no unrecognized
     vulnerabilities.

Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?

A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the
     Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in
     this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the
     President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet
     officials.

Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?

A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on
     encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify
     as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have
     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the
     decisions related to this initiative.

Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?

A:   The government designed and developed the key access
     encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the
     microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product
     manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip
     manufacturer that produces them.

Q:   Who provides the "Clipper Chip"?

A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,
     California, and will sell the chip to encryption device
     manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed
     to other vendors in the future.

Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices? 

A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating
     the "Clipper Chip" into their devices.
     
Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological
     solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be
     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more
     powerful encryption devices?

A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be
     considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow
     mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product
     that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive
     than others readily available today, but it is just one
     piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to
     encryption technology, which the Administration is
     developing.

     The Administration is not saying, "since encryption
     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,
     we will prohibit it outright" (as some countries have
     effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that "every
     American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an
     unbreakable commercial encryption product."  There is a
     false "tension" created in the assessment that this issue is
     an "either-or" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,
     and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,
     balanced approach such as is proposed with the "Clipper
     Chip" and similar encryption techniques.

Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton
     Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from
     that of the Bush Administration?  

A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption
     technology in telecommunications and computing and are
     committed to working with industry and public-interest
     groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'
     privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law
     enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime
     and terrorism.

Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use
     the government hardware?

A:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control
     requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is
     required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The
     same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the
     attractions of this technology is the protection it can give
     to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this
     in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a
     case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these
     devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan
     to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability
     of these products.

Subject: White House Public Encryption Management Fact Sheet

Note:     The following was released by the White House today in
          conjunction with the announcement of the Clipper Chip
          encryption technology.

                           FACT SHEET
                  PUBLIC ENCRYPTION MANAGEMENT

The President has approved a directive on "Public Encryption Management."  The
directive provides for the following:

Advanced telecommunications and commercially available encryption are part of
a wave of new computer and communications technology.  Encryption products
scramble information to protect the privacy of communications and data by
preventing unauthorized access.  Advanced telecommunications systems use
digital technology to rapidly and precisely handle a high volume of
communications.  These advanced telecommunications systems are integral to the
infrastructure needed to ensure economic competitiveness in the information
age.

Despite its benefits, new communications technology can also frustrate lawful
government electronic surveillance.  Sophisticated encryption can have this
effect in the United States.  When exported abroad, it can be used to thwart
foreign intelligence activities critical to our national interests.  In the
past, it has been possible to preserve a government capability to conduct
electronic surveillance in furtherance of legitimate law enforcement and
national security interests, while at the same time protecting the privacy and
civil liberties of all citizens.  As encryption technology improves, doing so
will require new, innovative approaches.

In the area of communications encryption, the U. S. Government has developed a
microcircuit that not only provides privacy through encryption that is
substantially more robust than the current government standard, but also
permits escrowing of the keys needed to unlock the encryption.  The system for
the escrowing of keys will allow the government to gain access to encrypted
information only with appropriate legal authorization.

To assist law enforcement and other government agencies to collect and
decrypt, under legal authority, electronically transmitted information, I
hereby direct the following action to be taken:

INSTALLATION OF GOVERNMENT-DEVELOPED MICROCIRCUITS

The Attorney General of the United States, or her representative, shall
request manufacturers of communications hardware which incorporates encryption
to install the U.S. government-developed key-escrow microcircuits in their
products.  The fact of law enforcement access to the escrowed keys will not be
concealed from the American public.  All appropriate steps shall be taken to
ensure that any existing or future versions of the key-escrow microcircuit are
made widely available to U.S. communications hardware manufacturers,
consistent with the need to ensure the security of the key-escrow system.  In
making this decision, I do not intend to prevent the private sector from
developing, or the government from approving, other microcircuits or
algorithms that are equally effective in assuring both privacy and a secure
key-escrow system.

KEY-ESCROW

The Attorney General shall make all arrangements with appropriate
entities to hold the keys for the key-escrow microcircuits
installed in communications equipment.  In each case, the key
holder must agree to strict security procedures to prevent
unauthorized release of the keys.  The keys shall be released only
to government agencies that have established their authority to
acquire the content of those communications that have been
encrypted by devices containing the microcircuits.  The Attorney
General shall review for legal sufficiency the procedures by which
an agency establishes its authority to acquire the content of such
communications.

PROCUREMENT AND USE OF ENCRYPTION DEVICES

The Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with other appropriate
U.S. agencies, shall initiate a process to write standards to
facilitate the procurement and use of encryption devices fitted
with key-escrow microcircuits in federal communications systems
that process sensitive but unclassified information.  I expect this
process to proceed on a schedule that will permit promulgation of
a final standard within six months of this directive. 

The Attorney General will procure and utilize encryption devices to
the extent needed to preserve the government's ability to conduct
lawful electronic surveillance and to fulfill the need for secure
law enforcement communications.  Further, the Attorney General
shall utilize funds from the Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture
Super Surplus Fund to effect this purchase.

Subject: "Clipper Chip"

I suppose we should have expected something after all of the sound and
fury of the last few years. The announcement does not really give
enough information though.

My first thought involves conventional compromise: what happens if the 
keys are captured through theft *and you know about it* - how difficult 
is it to change the keys ? What do you do between the time the loss is
detected and the time a new key set is approved. How difficult is it
to program the chip or do you need a new one ? (and if the chip can
be reprogrammed, how do you prevent covert changes that will not be
discovered until authorization to tap is received and the agency finds 
out that it cannot ?). Potentially this must occur every time a trusted
employee leaves.

For some time, I have been playing with dynamic access cards ("tokens")
as seeds for full session encryption rather than just for password devices.
Since the encryption requires three parts (PIN, challenge, and token)
which are only physically together at the secure system, and since only
the challenge passes on the net, and since once encryption starts you
have not only provided protection to the session, you have also authenticated
both ends simultaneously (by the fact that you can communicate), it seems
ideal. *And everything necessary already exists*. From several US companies.
It just has not been put together as a commercial product (FUD at work 8*(.

Since key generation is on-the-fly at the onset of the session, obviously
what the gov needs is not the key but the "key to the key" (of course
computers, even a PC, are really good at this.

The real question is "Why a new chip ?"  The technology to do this has been
around for years and several DES chips are available commercially today.
The BCC laptop (I like Beaver better 8*) 007 provides this internally
today with (I believe) the LSI-Logic chip and Enigma-Logic's PC-SAFE (plugs) 
does the same with software alone. As indicated in the announcement,
financial institutions have been using encrypted transmissions for years
without any great outcry.

IMHO the real hold-up has been $$$ - cheap error-correcting modem 
technology to prevent synch losses rather than a lack of good crypto 
algorithms. Today this is a done deal (actually we have known how to keep 
in synch since the sixties but you couldn't buy 56kb for under $300.00 at 
BizMart - now part of K-Mart ! - then).

True, there are a lot of questions yet to be answered, but again IMHO 
most center on the exception cases and not the encryption technology itself.

Subject: The Clipper Chip

I have just read with considerable interest the "White House Crypto
Statement" posted to comp.society.

Briefly, it announces a "Clipper Chip" that will provide voice and data
encryption.  Every chip will have two keys kept in two separate "key escrow"
banks.  Law enforcement officers needing to conduct a wire tap will get a
court order, go to the key escrow banks, and then decrypt the messages.

This is not entirely clear.  Does it mean that the Administration might
ban all encryption except for the Clipper Chip?  If not, how would
they stop criminals and terrorists from using something else?

The Administration might sell these chips abroad.  How will the Key
Escrow system work then?

How will the Administration handle free-trade issues?  How can a non-US
manufacturer export Clipper devices to the US without getting a look at the
algorithm (which is secret).  How would key escrow work with a non-US
manufacturer?

How will the algorithm be kept secret?  What is to stop someone prying the
device apart and examining the chip circuitry?

*Why* is the algorithm secret?  RSA is public and seems unbreakable.  Ditto
DES apart from a few known weaknesses.  This smells of a hidden agenda.  Could
it be trade?  Could it be part of a strategy to ban "bootleg" Clipper
technology where foreign chips conform to the standard but do not have the
keys in escrow.

How will law enforcers match keys to chips?  They won't have access to the
chip serial number.  Maybe the chip transmits its serial number every few
seconds of transmission.  If so then we have a nice way of doing traffic
analysis and tracking on suspects (or anyone else) without needing the keys.

Subject: Clinton's Clipper Chip Chaos

As soon as the official press release on the Clipper chip was posted a barrage
of posts concerned with the safety and RISKS of said chip smothered the net.
Nearly all of them were negative. For those of you who missed it, the Clipper
Chip is purported to be the 'Officially Sanctioned' cryptographic cypher chip.
The feature that everyone is getting upset about is that the FBI will have the
only general de-cypher box. Furthermore, the algorithm for encryption is
secret.

My concern about this whole scheme is greater than I can express here.  I'm
sure the next couple of RISKS forums will be filled with messages concerning
the Clipper Chip, but for what it's worth, here's my $0.02:

I am concerned that this is the first step towards banning any other
encryption device that does not use the CC.  I am concerned that if there
*exists* a general de-cypher box, it can be stolen/hacked/duplicated/captured
by aliens.  I am concerned about the fact that the encryption algorithm is
secret. There is no way we can be sure the algorithm is sufficiently secure.
Key length is not the only factor in telling how secure an algorithm is. An
encryption scheme should be secure even if the algorithm is known.  I am
concerned that if this thing takes off in the States, other countries will not
follow, making international communications no more secure. And is other
countries do follow, there will be more than one decrypt-box, which in turn
will multiply the risks of one of these boxes being stolen hacked/corrupted in
any other way. This box will be become a *hot* item for organised crime. (Why
do I keep seeing scenes from 'Sneakers'?)

In short: I think this whole CC thing is an ungood idea, and I hope for
everyone who values his privacy that it will never lift-off.

That is certainly the intent.

  First, who knows F? If the cop on the street knows F then it quickly
  becomes so widely known that everyone knows it and you might as well send
  the serial number in the clear.  Ergo only the escrow agents know F.

F is embedded in every Clipper Chip, but like other chip keys, unknown to the
people who use them.  Only law enforcement will have a decoder box that allows
the law enforcement field to be decrypted. Initially, there will be just one
box, and it will be operated by the FBI.

	Second, what information does law enforcement get from the
	escrow agents?  Ideally, law enforcement only gets K, the
	session key governing the conversation for which they have a
	court order.  Unfortunately, in order for law enforcement to
	get *only* K (and not U), the escrow agents must get together
	and secretly combine U1 and U2 so that they can unwrap K and
	give it to law enforcement.  But then the escrow agents would
	also know K, and they would be able to decrypt messages
	themselves.  That's just a very short step away from the
	omniscient big-brother which the multiple-escrower scheme was
	designed to prevent.  The escrow agents must not allowed to
	exchange keys with each other.  Ergo, law enforcement must
	assemble U itself in order to find out K.  This means that law
	enforcement now knows the key to unlock every session key ever
	used on this phone.

It is imperative that law enforcement get U.  If they are tapping a line,
there may be dozens of calls on that line per day.  It would be totally
impractical to have to go to the escrow agents to get the session key for each
call.  It would be impossible to do real-time decryption under that
constraint.

	Things are starting to look bad, but what about F?  We never
	really figured out what F was for, we just said that only the
	escrow agents know F.  Well, now we know what F is for.  Even
	if law enforcement knows U, they still can't read messages
	without court orders, because they can't obtain E[K;U] without
	knowing F, and only escrow knows F.

For the same reason as above, it is imperative that law enforcement be able to
decode the law enforcement field in order to obtain E[K; U] and then decrypt
this to get K.  It is completely impractical to go the escrow agents for each
conversation.

  I have one outstanding question that I haven't seen asked yet.  Is there a
  time component in the encryption key? Since wiretaps are presumably
  authorized for certain time periods with both start and end dates, it should
  not be possible to decrypt an illegally monitored message.
 
I am unaware of any time component.  Current wiretap laws protect against
this.  Evidence collected after the warrant has expired can be thrown out in
court.  In addition, it is illegal for the service provider to implement an
intercept after a warrant has expired.  With the new technologies, law
enforcers will be incapable of executing a tap without the assistance of the
service provider.

Lars-Henrik Eriksson has written

The NSA has a long record of success with crypto, far better than any
individual or organization in the public community.  In addition, there are
plans to bring in expert cryptographers to assess the algorithm.

It is possible for both ends to negotiate a session key K without transmitting
any secret information at all, including K.  One way of doing this is with a
public-key distribution method. The Diffie-Hellman method works as follows.
Machine A picks a secret value xa, and machine B picks xb.  A sends the public
value ya = g^xa mod p to B and B sends yb = g^xb mod p to A, where p is a huge
prime and g is a global constant.  Then A computes the session key K = yb^xa
mod p = g^xbxa mod p, and B computes K = ya^xb mod p = g^xaxb mod p.  Both K's
are the same.  An eavesdropper sees ya and yb, but since xa and xb are not
known, cannot compute K.  For more information about key exchange, see for
example my book "Cryptography and Data Security" or some other crypto text.

Subject: Thoughts on the U.S. Encryption Proposal

Mr. President:

I am concerned that your proposal fails to address the following issues,
among others:

1.  Will American companies have to manufacture different lines of
products according to the market (US vs. foreign--assuming that they
wouldn't be allowed to export the Clipper Chip) ?

2.  Will foreign companies be excluded from the American market since
they won't have access to the Clipper Chip ?

3.  If the technology is ever sold to other countries (foreign
governments), how will the US be sure that no foreign government
develops the ability to tap American communications, and how will
international communications be secure (remember that the two escrow
"agencies" are to be located in the US, a seemingly unacceptable
proposition for non-American entities) ?

4.  What guarantee is there that other encryption schemes will not be
outlawed in the future?  In particular, what guarantee is there that
the right retained by the people to privacy will not be ever more
violated by the US government in the future?  Will use of other,
private, secret encryption become a crime?

5.  What guarantee is there that criminals will use the Clipper Chip,
knowing that the US government has the ability to decrypt their
communications?  Isn't it probable that such criminals will resort to
publically available encryption systems that they would know are secure
from the US government?

6.  Since the secrecy of the algorithm seems to be essential, how does
your proposal compare to the strength of currently available non-secret
algorithms?  It is well known in Computer Science that reliance on the
ignorance of an enemy party is the worst protection imaginable, since
it is a very weak link in the chain of safety.

7.  An American hero once said something to the effect that those who
are willing to trade liberty for safety deserve neither.  Don't you
think you are asking the American people to trade liberty (their right
to privacy) in exchange for an elusive safety (listening to suspected
criminals, if these criminals buy the government's chip)?

8.  How is it justifiable to ask the American people that they spend
money (for the Clipper Chip) in order to let the government listen on
them?  Given the current state of the economy, is it even possible?

9.  Finally, what constitutional article gives you the power to violate
the privacy of the American people?  Didn't you swear to uphold the US
constitution?

Sincerely,

Subject: Re: Clipper Chip (Alvarez, RISKS-14.52) 

   The summary isn't very specific, but it sounds like the message stream is
   transmitted first, followed by the escrow field.  Surely this can't be the
   case, because all one needs to do is hang up at the appropriate point in the
   call and prevent the transmission of the escrow field...

One way of solving this "problem" is to have the escrow block consist of:

  E[{E[K ; U],N,SHA[{E[K ; U],N}]} ; F]

Where SHA[] represents the Secure Hash Algorithm (in the Capstone
Chip), though frankly a CRC32 would probably do just as well. The
receiving Clipper can then decrypt each received law enforcement block
and verify that the SHA hash of the contents match the supplied hash.
If they fail, the chip ceases to perform any decryption operations on
behalf of the user.  Perhaps other information could be included in
the encryption under "F" to make it difficult to supply a law
enforcement block from another prior conversation. This could well be
a detail that was left out of the explanation given to Dorothy.

Btw. I will go on record as being opposed to this entire proposal. My
interpretation of the Constitution (and the Bill of Rights) on this issue is
that the 4th amendment (no search and seizure without a warrant) was intended
to place limitations on the right of the government to interfere with the
people. It is being twisted around by some to imply that we the people never
had the right to privacy in the first place, when a warrant was issued. As
others have mentioned here, I have a real concern that a VOLUNTARY program
today will turn into a mandatory program tomorrow. In my nightmares I envision
an agent of (pick your favorite large, secretive, government agency) telling
Congress:

"Yes Senator, but we gave the American Public privacy five year's ago with the
Clipper program. They still have that privacy today. However some miscreants
in our society... drug dealers and whatnot are still using non-Clipper
unbreakable encryption and we must put a stop to this..."

From: "Paul R. Coen" <PCOEN@DRUNIVAC.DREW.EDU>
Subject: Clipper chip & databases

A few things have occurred to me as I've read the announcements and the
initial reactions. 

Each chip contains and broadcasts the serial number.  To be frank, if they
don't use a lot of different family keys, then that number is going to be
rather public, rather quickly. 

Legally, what is this going to do to wiretaps?  If I have recorded a
conversation, have I tapped it?  Or have I only tapped it when I decrypt it?
This could lead to recording lots of conversations, and then only getting the
keys and actually "tapping" once I get someone for something criminal.  A
change to the law or court ruling could establish this. For now, they need
permission up front (with exceptions, noted below), but I could see that
changing.

Doesn't the manufacturer need to give the keys to the escrow agencies? With the
serial number?  Am I missing something, or is there a RISK of the manufacturer
becoming compromised?  

The other thing is that companies are going to be using this for international
calls.  And, calls in other countries.  I'm sure most of you have noticed that
agencies of the US Government tend not to follow the procedural niceties that
they at least have to give lip service to here when dealing with communications
elsewhere.  If the CIA or NSA decides they want a tap, can they get the keys
for a unit in another country without a court order, by saying "it's for
national security" three times and throwing a rock in the air?  Besides, the
NSA gets really itchy if they can't just monitor international calls whenever
they want.  So, what are they going to do -- record the call data and decrypt
it later if they need to?  They don't need specific authorization now to tap
and record international calls.  I can't see that changing.

What I read in one of the gov't documents implied that the A.G. was responsible
for defining some sort of reasonable authorization.  Why do I have a feeling
that "national security" is going to come up a lot?  Especially since there has
been an increase in cold-war style rhetoric in reference to *economic*
competition?  Regarding profitable technologies as national security concerns
for the sake of economic competition is a scary thing. And this chip plays
right into that desire for control.  As other people have pointed out, once
they've got your key, they've got your key.  If someone gets it for national
security reasons, then you might just be out of luck.

From: Tony Harminc <TONY@VM1.MCGILL.CA>
Subject:      Clipper Chip

Thoughts on the Clipper Chip:

1) One of the selling points of the Clipper chip is that US companies will be
able to use it to effect secure communication between their home offices and
branches in foreign countries.  In particular, it is implied that it is the
governments of those foreign countries that will be thwarted in their attempts
to listen in to the corporate secrets of America.

Now why would any "friendly" foreign government (e.g. Canada, France,
New Zealand) imaginably permit Clipper to be used on its territory
unless it too has access to the keys for "law enforcement purposes" ?

So if XYZ Corp. wants to talk in private with its French subsidiary XYZ
France, SA., the French government will want access to the escrow agents so
that it too can present a court order (according to French law, of course) and
be given XYZ's key, if it suspects wrongdoing on the part of XYZ France.  But
this clearly won't do.  The US escrow agents will presumably be subject to US
law and might be able to refuse a French court order on some US constitutional
grounds.  So the French will have to have their own pair of agents, and -
since there is no advance control of which chips will end up in France - these
French agents will have to have the complete list of all keys.  Now multiply
this by a dozen or so friendly countries, with an equal number of different
legal systems and constitutions...

2) Presumably the reason for keeping the algorithms secret is to prevent
competitive manufacture of chips (or software) that can communicate with
Clippers from being produced.  (Such competitors might somehow forget to send
their key lists to the escrow agents.)

I know almost nothing of the technology, but it seems far fetched to me that a
chip can be manufactured that *absolutely, positively* cannot be reverse
engineered, or at least satisfies something analogous to being computationally
infeasible to reverse engineer.

There was no mention of quantum effects, but I know of no other way to even
begin to make something that can't be examined with appropriate probes.  I
hope some hardware experts will say something on this topic.  Or is it that
the hardware design can be reverse engineered, but the algorithms themselves
are one-way encrypted ?

3) It is not clear to me how tapping of bidirectional communications
works.  If the police have a court order to tap the phone of suspected
criminal X, and they find that he is holding a Clipper-encrypted
conversation with previously unknown person Y, will they be able to
decrypt only what X says if they have only X's key from escrow ?
Or will they automatically apply for Y's key too, on the grounds
that he is an associate of X ?

Ordinary analogue phones (and networks) echo a small amount of the received
signal to the sender, but an encrypting phone will have digitized and
encrypted the signal before it gets echoed (even if there is a modem and
analogue circuit in the loop).

From: padgett@tccslr.dnet.mmc.com (A. PADGETT PETERSON, (407)826-1101)
Subject: Baltimore Clipper

With all of the sound and fury surrounding the announcement, I think a few
things have been missed. First, no-one has said that Clipper is going to
replace the STU-III or the Lockheed Encrypting Modem (just passed up an
opportunity to buy a couple for $25 - only 1200 baud) or all of the other
devices that exist. Elements of the Norton Utilities and PKZIP would also have
to be outlawed.  The "user selected table" in UUENCODE would be right out.

Second, prohibition of double encryption using Clipper as one stage would be 
impossible to enforce through sheer mass. Comes under the same category
as strict enforcement of the speed limit.

So what is Clipper ? IMHO it will be a low-cost way to provide *reasonable*
protection for routine traffic that up until now has been unprotected.
Cellular telephony is the obvious first use to reduce the billion-dollar
fraud situation. Transmittal of medical records, legal records, credit
reports is another. Privacy laws state that these must be protected.
Clipper provides a legal remedy that has been lacking.

Telecommuting is another major problem for most companies who have been back
through fear of unautorized interception. Clipper will provide a "warm and
fuzzy" feeling with low-cost encrypting modems.

IMHO, Clipper must meet the "good enough" test. Clipper *will* meet the "good
enough" test because the designers are not stupid and it would be a major
*political* embarrassment should it prove to be easily broken, we just do not
know all of the facts yet.

Technically, I can make a guess and say that little of what we have seen
as yet is correct. For instance if the Message Key (K) is only 30 bits
long and the message is encrypted  E(M;K) as mentioned several times,
a massive attack with existing technology that is not particularly
expen$ive would yield a solution in under a minute. (Hint: check out
DSPs). Therefore the message is not encrypted E(M;K).

Further, there is a Family Key (F) and a Unit Key (U) in each chip. The
only link to these is the serial number therefore I *suspect* that the
serial number will be sent en clair as part of the header. It would be
possible to use only selected Family Keys and create E(s/n;F) such that 
it would easily yield the s/n but why (more later).

So most likely we will have a message key that will be a predetermined
function of K,U,&F (FN1). The header might consist of the serial number,
followed by an encrypted function of K,U,& F (FN2) that is different from
(MK), then the message encrypted with MK.

Before engaging Clipper, both FN1 and FN2 would have to be exchanged.

On starting communication, the header would consist of the serial number,
followed by FN2, followed by E(M;FN1). To the receiving Clipper, the
serial number would act as a "wake up". Since the chip would have K,U, & F
it would then reverse FN2 and create FN1 and decode the message. A longer
header could accommodate conference calling. This removes any incentive
to spoof the s/n since the receiving chip will assume it is for someone
else. (Exercise is left to the student). 

A "promiscuous" chip might be designed but it would have to have all 
U and F keys (of course the total number issued is probably going to be 
less than the number of ZIP codes so this *is* a danger point...).

The "key master" would hold one element say the s/n,U function, the 
"gatekeeper" s/n,F. On proper application each would contribute its part
but the requesting authority would receive only FN1, not the means to 
recreate it. Alternately, the requesting authority might receive a
duplicate Clipper chip but not the Keys - this protects the keys from
disclosure *and* provides physical traceability of the duplicate Clipper.
On completion of the tap authorization, the duplicate must be destroyed.

Certainly, there are still some things to be worked out but these are 
technical details. IMHO we *need* a cheap means of "good enough" encryption,
something that can be built into modems and cell phones at a disposable
cost. We *need* a workable Clipper, and the government has more to lose
in providing a flawed product than we do.

Subject: Re: Clipper Chip

One thing (among several) that disturbs me about the Clipper Chip is the
release of the decryption key to law enforcement bodies, who have various
legal maneuverings to circumvent ever notifying the tappee, after the wiretap
has completed, that their key has been compromised.

The key, originally safeguarded by the key escrow bank, is now additionally
held by unknown and unaudited persons within law enforcement.

History has shown that the law enforcement community has not been above
using information gained during illegal wiretaps...  Once they have the
key, they have access forever to your conversations.

And, supposing that one is actually notified that they were being
wiretapped, and thus need a new key.  Will the agency responsible for
the tap pay any costs for obtaining new keys?

Further, the information packet provided by Mat Heyman's office fails to
address the question of using non-clipper chip encryption.  They call their
technology "more secure than many other voice encryption systems readily
available" -- admitting that more secure systems are available.  Why should
anyone believe they do not intend to make illegal competing methods of
encryption?

Subject: time, recording, and clipper

In some of the recent comments on the RISKS of Clipper, it would seem that the
commentators are ignoring the results of including omnivorous recording.  It
is well known that it is possible to record a substantial amount of traffic
for archival storage and later analysis.  Such recording is not prevented by
any encryption scheme, whether keys are escrowed or not.

The resulting RISK of this assumption is that we may erode away the notion
that pure recording is a violation of privacy (today's wiretap law prevents
recording conversations without a warrant).  What could be wrong with law
enforcers or others recording everything, now that it is masked by encryption?
Surely this is NOT a violation of privacy because you can't read it.  I'd bet
that such recordings and archival would be authorized by most governmental
lawyers as NOT violating privacy on this basis.  But in fact, with key escrow,
someone on a fishing expedition could in principle recover all past history
from an archival database.

I think that the design of Clipper protocols is actually more suitable for
ex-post-facto decryption of recorded conversations, rather than for getting
access to not-yet-happening transactions.  So the notion that we might be
moving to a world where recording is real would make sense.

I also notice that the protocol for selecting conversation keys requires an
online conversation -- thus one cannot use Clipper for leaving secure voice
mail in a voice mail box, as far as I can tell.  Similarly, conference
calling, etc. need to be considered in the design of secure phones.  If
conference calling services (such as AT&T's service) require that the security
devices be turned off or compromised, there is a risk that users will be
deceived about their level of security.

My point, then, is that issues related to recording seem to have been
poorly considered in this proposal.  Perhaps I'm wrong, but I'd like to
understand this better, in the context of societal impacts that may result.

An amazing amount of discussion and speculation has been generated by the
clipper chip announcement.  Special thanks to Dorothy Denning for her summary,
and kudos to Don Alvarez for asking good questions.  But I have yet to see
anyone ask (or answer) the obvious question:

Will the various government agencies be using the clipper chip?

If so, I heartily endorse the policy.  It guarantees that government messages
cannot be ultimately secret from the governed.  It seems to me that the private
sector will continue to use whatever encryption is appropriate for their needs,
(even should laws to the contrary be passed,) and that the only agencies
obliged live with the consequences are those of the government itself.

                     THE CLIPPER CHIP: A TECHNICAL SUMMARY
                               Dorothy Denning
                           Revised, April 21, 1993

INTRODUCTION

On April 16, the President announced a new initiative that will bring
together the Federal Government and industry in a voluntary program
to provide secure communications while meeting the legitimate needs of
law enforcement.  At the heart of the plan is a new tamper-proof encryption
chip called the "Clipper Chip" together with a split-key approach to
escrowing keys.  Two escrow agencies are used, and the key parts from
both are needed to reconstruct a key.


CHIP CONTENTS

The Clipper Chip contains a classified single-key 64-bit block
encryption algorithm called "Skipjack."  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys
(compared with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling
(compared with 16 for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of
operation.  The algorithm takes 32 clock ticks, and in Electronic
Codebook (ECB) mode runs at 12 Mbits per second.

Each chip includes the following components:

   the Skipjack encryption algorithm
   F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips
   N, a 30-bit serial number (this length is subject to change)
   U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip

The chips are programmed by Mykotronx, Inc., which calls them the
"MYK-78."  The silicon is supplied by VLSI Technology Inc.  They are
implemented in 1 micron technology and will initially sell for about
$30 each in quantities of 10,000 or more.  The price should drop as the
technology is shrunk to .8 micron.


ENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP

To see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&T
telephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and
we both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure
conversation, my security device will negotiate an 80-bit session key K
with the device at the other end.  This key negotiation takes place
without the Clipper Chip.  In general, any method of key exchange can
be used such as the Diffie-Hellman public-key distribution method.

Once the session key K is established, the Clipper Chip is used to
encrypt the conversation or message stream M (digitized voice).  The
telephone security device feeds K and M into the chip to produce two
values:

   E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and 
   E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement field , 

which are transmitted over the telephone line.  The law enforcement
field thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U
concatenated with the serial number N, all encrypted under the family
key F.  The law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after
an authorized wiretap has been installed.

The ciphertext E[M; K] is decrypted by the receiver's device using the
session key:

   D[E[M; K]; K] = M .


CHIP PROGRAMMING AND ESCROW

All Clipper Chips are programmed inside a SCIF (Secure Compartmented
Information Facility), which is essentially a vault.  The SCIF contains
a laptop computer and equipment to program the chips.  About 300 chips
are programmed during a single session.  The SCIF is located at
Mykotronx.

At the beginning of a session, a trusted agent from each of the two key
escrow agencies enters the vault.  Agent 1 enters a secret, random
80-bit value S1 into the laptop and agent 2 enters a secret, random
80-bit value S2. These random values serve as seeds to generate unit
keys for a sequence of serial numbers.  Thus, the unit keys are a
function of 160 secret, random bits, where each agent knows only 80.
  
To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is
first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1.
S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a
64-bit block R1:

        R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .

Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and
N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:  

        R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1] 
        R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .

R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The
first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The
rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2
are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow
agencies.

As a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they are
written onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a
file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part
U1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third
disk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent
2 takes the second disk.  Thus each agent walks away knowing
an 80-bit seed and the 80-bit key parts.  However, the agent does not
know the other 80 bits used to generate the keys or the other 80-bit
key parts.  

The third disk is used to program the chips.  After the chips are
programmed, all information is discarded from the vault and the agents
leave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional assurance that no
information is left behind.
 
The protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the
room instead of two.  The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2,
and the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back to
the escrow agencies. 

The escrow agencies have as yet to be determined, but they will not
be the NSA, CIA, FBI, or any other law enforcement agency.  One or
both may be independent from the government.


LAW ENFORCEMENT USE

When law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line, they
will first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get
access to the communications line.  Let us assume that the tap is in
place and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with the
Clipper Chip.  The law enforcement field is first decrypted with the
family key F, giving E[K; U] + N.  Documentation certifying that a tap
has been authorized for the party associated with serial number N is
then sent (e.g., via secure FAX) to each of the key escrow agents, who
return (e.g., also via secure FAX) U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are XORed
together to produce the unit key U, and E[K; U] is decrypted to get the
session key K.  Finally the message stream is decrypted.  All this will
be accomplished through a special black box decoder.


CAPSTONE: THE NEXT GENERATION

A successor to the Clipper Chip, called "Capstone" by the government
and "MYK-80" by Mykotronx, has already been developed.  It will include
the Skipjack algorithm, the Digital Signature Standard (DSS), the
Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA), a method of key exchange, a fast
exponentiator, and a randomizer.  A prototoype will be available for
testing on April 22, and the chips are expected to be ready for
delivery in June or July.

Subject: CPSR calls for public debate on encryption initiative

April 16, 1993					    Washington, DC


               COMPUTER PROFESSIONALS CALL FOR PUBLIC 
           DEBATE ON NEW GOVERNMENT ENCRYPTION INITIATIVE

	Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR) today called
for the public disclosure of technical data underlying the government's
newly-announced "Public Encryption Management" initiative.  The new
cryptography scheme was announced today by the White House and the National
Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), which will implement the
technical specifications of the plan.  A NIST spokesman acknowledged that the
National Security Agency (NSA), the super-secret military intelligence agency,
had actually developed the encryption technology around which the new
initiative is built.

	According to NIST, the technical specifications and the Presidential
directive establishing the plan are classified.  To open the initiative to
public review and debate, CPSR today filed a series of Freedom of Information
Act (FOIA) requests with key agencies, including NSA, NIST, the National
Security Council and the FBI for information relating to the encryption plan.
The CPSR requests are in keeping with the spirit of the Computer Security Act,
which Congress passed in 1987 in order to open the development of non-military
computer security standards to public scrutiny and to limit NSA's role in the
creation of such standards.

	CPSR previously has questioned the role of NSA in developing the
so-called "digital signature standard" (DSS), a communications authentication
technology that NIST proposed for government-wide use in 1991.  After CPSR
sued NIST in a FOIA lawsuit last year, the civilian agency disclosed for the
first time that NSA had, in fact, developed that security standard.  NSA is
due to file papers in federal court next week justifying the classification of
records concerning its creation of the DSS.

	David Sobel, CPSR Legal Counsel, called the administration's apparent
commitment to the privacy of electronic communications, as reflected in
today's official statement, "a step in the right direction."  But he
questioned the propriety of NSA's role in the process and the apparent secrecy
that has thus far shielded the development process from public scrutiny.  "At
a time when we are moving towards the development of a new information
infrastructure, it is vital that standards designed to protect personal
privacy be established openly and with full public participation.  It is not
appropriate for NSA -- an agency with a long tradition of secrecy and
opposition to effective civilian cryptography -- to play a leading role in the
development process."

	CPSR is a national public-interest alliance of computer industry
professionals dedicated to examining the impact of technology on society.
CPSR has 21 chapters in the U.S. and maintains offices in Palo Alto,
California, Cambridge, Massachusetts and Washington, DC.  For additional

From: Peter Wayner <pcw@access.digex.com>
Subject: Clipped Wings-- The Economic Impediment to the Clipper Chip...

If all of the privacy concerns about the Clipper chip magically disappeared,
the chip will still encounter widespread economic resistance.  Why? Because
almost everything can be done cheaper in software and the secrecy surrounding
the algorithm effectively prohibits software implementations.

Why would a computer designer add a high-speed encryption chip to the machine?
Even if the chips cost about $25 in large quantities, they could still add
about $100 to the final cost after everyone takes their markups.  The computer
designer must ask whether people are willing to spend extra to buy a box when
the clone manufacturer in the garage down the street isn't going to be putting
one in.

Adding encryption in software is a different proposition.  There is a one-time
cost of engineering and a small extra cost for increased support.  Once the
code is written, the manufacturing costs do not increase.  Also, software can
retrofit machines for no extra cost and add widespread compatibility after the
update is finished.  This is why Novell, Apple and Microsoft choose to add
encryption software in their latest rev of the system software.

It is not even clear that the standard has much of a chance in the phone
system.  DSP chips and digital designs are becoming more and more part of
cellular standards.  Why pay extra for another chip if it can be done in the
DSP? Weight and power consumption are important considerations for these
applications.

I'm sure that the algorithm designers and NSA committee considered the RISKS
of exposing the algorithm.  Scrutiny weakens the code because it makes it
easier for people to attack the system.  It is obvious that the committee
tried to consider some of the economic RISKS involved in promulgating a "Big
Brother" standard.  That is why they arranged for the chips to be presented as
a fait accompli as part of AT&T's latest phones.  But they face an uphill
battle against the forces of economics.

Subject: Letter to Clinton, re: the encryption proposal

I mailed the following letter to the President today:

To: 0005895485@MCIMAIL.COM (White House)
Subject: Second thoughts about your encryption proposal

						17 April 1993

Dear Mr. President --

Since writing my initial reaction I have given considerable second thought to
your encryption proposal, announced yesterday.  I must withdraw my initial
partial support for your plan, pending the release of further details.

My initial assumption was that you were mandating the replacement of every
telephone handset in the USA with one which would digitize the person's voice
and encrypt it.  I assumed that this replacement would start with cellular
handsets and proceed through wireless and wired -- in order of severity of
vulnerability.  Given that the government would mandate such a change and that
that change would interfere with the FBI's current ability to tap voice
telephone calls on the public networks, it made sense to propose an encryption
method which would allow the FBI to continue in court-ordered wiretaps --
specifically via key escrow.

While it would be beneficial from the point of view of improving the
privacy and security of citizens from illegal eavesdropping, I now believe
that this proposal is far too costly to undertake at this time.  The
federal government is facing a huge debt and deficit and the private sector
is far from thriving.  The proposal to pay for some of this equipment with
funds from civil forfeiture adds insult to injury, since abuses of civil
forfeiture have led me to conclude that law enforcement's right to such
funds should be severely restricted if not removed.

If this proposal is only for limited use of such encryption, then it does
little to advance the cause of citizen's privacy and it is in direct
competition with existing products which already service the small market
of citizens who are aware of their vulnerability and who are willing to pay
for assurance of their privacy.  It is especially disturbing that the press
release suggests that this proposal is not merely a call for action but an
already designed implementation which some agency of the administration is
attempting to impose upon the American people.  The talent exists in the
private sector to address these security concerns.

Meanwhile, there is a danger that the key escrow provision is intended to
imply that all cryptosystems used by citizens in the lawful course of their
daily personal and business lives must include key registration.  This
would be an unacceptable erosion of our current rights, especially of the
fundamental right of privacy which you supported so strongly during your
campaign.  Legislation to this effect would be unenforceable.  It would be
easily and frequently broken -- leading to the danger that some law
enforcement officer with a private grudge would have an easy method of
filing a criminal complaint against the innocent victim of his grudge.  A
requirement for key registration would also come directly into conflict
with certain uses of cryptography in advanced computer system design.  In
those cases, both key registration and use of some government-designed chip
are unacceptable.

Meanwhile, there is the additional danger that this proposal would serve as
a vehicle for advancing the FBI's wiretap proposal which was rejected by
Congress last year and which I oppose on several grounds.

I look forward to full technical details of your proposal and to a public
debate on its merits.

Subject: Hacking turnpike signs

Sometime last week, electronic sign boards along Interstate 95 in Connecticut
were hacked to say "You all suck." These boards are normally used to announce
construction, fog, and whatnot.  Apparently it was several hours before State
Police and the Highway Department were able to clear the messages. Well, it
happened again a day or two ago, with a different message attacking the
Governer. A teenager has been caught; he said that there was no password on
the Highway Department's computer system.

I originally heard this on a short news blurb on WHJY, a rock station in
Providence RI, so I'm sure the accuracy is all you would expect it to be.
Confirming reports welcomed!

I'm just waiting for the day that the speed limit signs go electronic.
They'll probably only allow two digits, though...

The last line, of course, explain the proximate cause and points a flashing
red arrow toward the root cause.  I read RISKS 14:50 just a couple of days
after a lessons-learned article on "lockout/ tagout" in Occupational Safety
OBSERVER, a newsletter from the Department of Energy's Office of Safety and
Quality Assurance.  (Lockout/tagout is a set of rules and procedures meant to
keep electricians and others who work with stored energy from releasing it
through themselves.)

The article pointed out, strenuously, that the cardinal rule of lockout/tagout
is, "*never* remove a tag affixed by someone else."  When you have virtual
"tags" affixed by a computer, and operators who perhaps were not exposed to
the subset of technical endeavors where the lockout/tagout discipline is used,
you have a risk added to another risk!

The irony, of course, is that the computer system took the right action but
was subverted by its user.  I doubt that there will ever be a system so
sophisticated that some dumb bunny can't cause a disaster.  The lesson:
designers of man-in-the-loop systems have to understand operator psychology,
and owners of such systems have to provide appropriate training that accounts
for such risks and then maintain a culture that places importance on avoiding
them.

to one of the SRBs.  They did not say if they were "jammed" in to some spot or
if they were in fact holding on to something.  If the latter, one would have
to assume that they are probably "Vise-Grips" or a generic version of them.  I
can see the commercial advertisements now....  "The pliers that grip so tight,
they will keep holding on even through the G-Forces of a space shuttle
launch".

Apparently NASA is scrambling to figure out what went wrong.  One would
think so given the sensitivity to another possible failure of the SRBs.

Subject: Badge entry and forgotten badges

I work for a large company with badge entry systems for all buildings
and all internal labs.  This is normally great, because I can get into
my building any time I want, day or night, and I can get into the labs
that I need to use, but it keeps me out of places I don't belong.  It
also does the same for others.

About once a year, however, I forget my badge.  This is not a problem
for the normal person who comes in after 8:00 in the morning when the
building is open and there is a receptionist, but I carpool from quite
a distance away, before traffic gets heavy, and I get in about 6:45.

This morning was one of those rare occasions when I forgot my badge.
No problem, each building has a phone at the front door that rings
through directly to security.  I picked it up and told them that I
needed to get into the building.  They asked me a few questions, like
what is my name, my badge number, my phone extension and two or three
other such pieces of information, then they opened the door remotely
and I was let into the building.

As I was walking to my office, I realized that all of the information I
was required to give them is contained on-line in our computer network
and anyone with access to a workstation could get this information
about anyone in the company in just a few seconds.  I'm not recommending
that the database be changed, because it is a great aid to employee
intercommunication.  However, I expect that I could easily get into
some building where I don't belong by gathering this information about
someone who works in that building.  I don't even need to know a name
to get this information, the database allows searches by building.

Not too long ago, when I needed to be let in a building, someone from
security would come by, check a photo ID, such as a drivers license,
then let me in with a key.  Even though my company has become much more
security conscious during the 5 years I've worked here, I believe it is
a security risk to allow building entry based solely on information
given over the phone that is contained in a computer database readily
accessible to anyone who can access the network.  I'm going to
recommend a change to this procedure.

Here is some technical information on the infamous clipper chip. 
As far as I can tell, it is enough to know that it isn't
really useful for anything other than, possibly, a front end
for some real encryption technology.

I received the following two notes from Martin Hellman with details
on how Clipper will work.  They are posted with his permission.  The
implications of some details are fascinating.

Subject: Clipper Chip


Most of you have seen the announcement in Friday's NY Times,
etc. about NIST (National Institute of Standards & Technology)
announcing the "Clipper Chip" crypto device. Several messges
on the net have asked for more technical details, and some have
been laboring under understandable misunderstandings given
the lack of details in the news  articles. So here to help out
is your friendly NSA link: me. I was somewhat surprised Friday
to get a call from the Agency which supplied many of the missing
details. I was told the info was public, so here it is (the cc of this
to Dennis Branstad at NIST is mostly as a double check on my
facts since I assume he is aware of all this; please let me know
if I have anything wrong):

The Clipper Chip will have a secret crypto algorithm embedded in 
Silicon. Each chip will have two secret, 80-bit keys. One will be the 
same for all chips (ie a system-wide key) and the other will be unit 
specific. I don't know what NIST and NSA will call them, but I will 
call them the system key SK and unit key UK in this message. 
The IC will be designed to be extremely difficult to reverse so 
that the system key can be kept secret. (Aside: It is clear that 
they also want to keep the algorithm secret and, in my opinion, 
it may be as much for that as this stated purpose.) The unit key 
will be generated as the XOR of two 80-bit random numbers K1 
and K2 (UK=K1+K2) which will be kept by the two escrow 
authorities. Who these escrow authorities will be is still to be 
decided by the Attorney General, but it was stressed to me that 
they will NOT be NSA or law enforcement agencies, that they 
must be parties acceptable to the users of the system as unbiased. 
When a law enforcement agency gets a court order, they will 
present it to these two escrow authorities and receive K1 and 
K2, thereby allowing access to the unit key UK.

In addition to the system key, each user will get to choose his 
or her own key and change it as often as desired. Call this key 
plain old K. When a message is to be sent it will first be 
encrypted under K, then K will be encrypted under the unit key UK, 
and the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part 
message which will then be encrypted under the system key SK 
producing

     E{ E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number;  SK}

When a court order obtains K1 and K2, and thence K, the law 
enforcement agency will use SK to decrypt all information 
flowing on the suspected link [Aside: It is my guess that 
they may do this constantly on all links, with or without a 
court order, since it is almost impossible to tell which links 
over which a message will flow.] This gives the agency access to 

     E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number

in the above message. They then check the serial number 
of the unit and see if it is on the "watch list" for which they 
have a court order. If so, they will decrypt E[K; UK] to obtain K, 
and then decrypt E[M; K] to obtain M.

I am still in the process of assessing this scheme, so please do 
not take the above as any kind of endorsement of the proposed 
scheme. All I am trying to do is help all of us assess the scheme 
more knowledgably. But I will say that the need for just one court 
order worries me. I would feel more comfortable (though not 
necessarily comfortable!) if two separate court orders were 
needed, one per escrow authority. While no explanation is
needed, the following story adds some color: In researching
some ideas that Silvio Micali and I have been kicking around,
I spoke with Gerald Gunther, the constitutional law expert
here at Stanford and he related the following story: When
Edward Levi became Pres. Ford's attorney general (right
after Watergate), he was visited by an FBI agent asking
for "the wiretap authorizations." When Levy asked for
the details so he could review the cases as required by
law, the agent told him that his predecessors just turned
over 40-50 blank, signed forms every time. Levi did not
comply and changed the system, but the lesson is clear: 
No single person or authority should have the power to
authorize wiretaps (or worse yet, divulging of personal
keys). Sometimes he or she will be an Edward Levi
and sometimes a John Mitchell.

It is fine to post my previous message to sci.crypt 
if you also post this message with it in which:

1. I ask recipients to be sparse in their requesting further info 
from me or asking for comments on specific questions. By
this posting I apologize for any messages I am unable to
respond to. (I already spend too much time answering too much
e-mail and am particularly overloaded this week with other
responsibilities.) 

2. I note a probably correction sent to me by Dorothy Denning.
She met with the person from NSA that
I talked with by phone, so her understanding is likely to
better than mine on this point: Where I said the transmitted
info is  E{ E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number;  SK}
she says the message is not double encrypted. The system
key (or family key as she was told it is called) only encrypts
the serial number or the serial number and the encrypted
unit key. This is not a major difference, but I thought it
should be mentioned and thank her for bringing it to
my attention. It makes more sense since it cuts down
on encryption computation overhead.

Short summary of what Bellovin says Hellman says the NSA says: There is
a global key G, plus one key U_C for each chip C. The user can choose a
new session key K_P for each phone call P he makes. Chip C knows three
keys: G, its own U_C, and the user's K_P. The government as a whole
knows G and every U_C. Apparently a message M is encrypted as
E_G(E_{U_C}(K_P),C) , E_{K_P}(M). That's it.

The system as described here can't possibly work. What happens when
someone plugs the above ciphertext into a receiving chip? To get M
the receiving chip needs K_P; to get K_P the receiving chip needs U_C.
The only information it can work with is C. If U_C can be computed
from C then the system is cryptographically useless and the ``key
escrow'' is bullshit. Otherwise how is a message decrypted?

                     THE CLIPPER CHIP: A TECHNICAL SUMMARY

                               Dorothy Denning

                           Revised, April 21, 1993


INTRODUCTION

On April 16, the President announced a new initiative that will bring
together the Federal Government and industry in a voluntary program
to provide secure communications while meeting the legitimate needs of
law enforcement.  At the heart of the plan is a new tamper-proof encryption
chip called the "Clipper Chip" together with a split-key approach to
escrowing keys.  Two escrow agencies are used, and the key parts from
both are needed to reconstruct a key.


CHIP CONTENTS

The Clipper Chip contains a classified single-key 64-bit block
encryption algorithm called "Skipjack."  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys
(compared with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling
(compared with 16 for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of
operation.  The algorithm takes 32 clock ticks, and in Electronic
Codebook (ECB) mode runs at 12 Mbits per second.

Each chip includes the following components:

   the Skipjack encryption algorithm
   F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips
   N, a 30-bit serial number (this length is subject to change)
   U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip

The chips are programmed by Mykotronx, Inc., which calls them the
"MYK-78."  The silicon is supplied by VLSI Technology Inc.  They are
implemented in 1 micron technology and will initially sell for about
$30 each in quantities of 10,000 or more.  The price should drop as the
technology is shrunk to .8 micron.


ENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP

To see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&T
telephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and
we both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure
conversation, my security device will negotiate an 80-bit session key K
with the device at the other end.  This key negotiation takes place
without the Clipper Chip.  In general, any method of key exchange can
be used such as the Diffie-Hellman public-key distribution method.

Once the session key K is established, the Clipper Chip is used to
encrypt the conversation or message stream M (digitized voice).  The
telephone security device feeds K and M into the chip to produce two
values:

   E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and 
   E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement field , 

which are transmitted over the telephone line.  The law enforcement
field thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U
concatenated with the serial number N, all encrypted under the family
key F.  The law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after
an authorized wiretap has been installed.

The ciphertext E[M; K] is decrypted by the receiver's device using the
session key:

   D[E[M; K]; K] = M .


CHIP PROGRAMMING AND ESCROW

All Clipper Chips are programmed inside a SCIF (Secure Compartmented
Information Facility), which is essentially a vault.  The SCIF contains
a laptop computer and equipment to program the chips.  About 300 chips
are programmed during a single session.  The SCIF is located at
Mykotronx.

At the beginning of a session, a trusted agent from each of the two key
escrow agencies enters the vault.  Agent 1 enters a secret, random
80-bit value S1 into the laptop and agent 2 enters a secret, random
80-bit value S2. These random values serve as seeds to generate unit
keys for a sequence of serial numbers.  Thus, the unit keys are a
function of 160 secret, random bits, where each agent knows only 80.
  
To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is
first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1.
S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a
64-bit block R1:

        R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .

Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and
N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:  

        R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1] 
        R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .

R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The
first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The
rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2
are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow
agencies.

As a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they are
written onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a
file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part
U1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third
disk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent
2 takes the second disk.  Thus each agent walks away knowing
an 80-bit seed and the 80-bit key parts.  However, the agent does not
know the other 80 bits used to generate the keys or the other 80-bit
key parts.  

The third disk is used to program the chips.  After the chips are
programmed, all information is discarded from the vault and the agents
leave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional assurance that no
information is left behind.
 
The protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the
room instead of two.  The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2,
and the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back to
the escrow agencies. 

The escrow agencies have as yet to be determined, but they will not
be the NSA, CIA, FBI, or any other law enforcement agency.  One or
both may be independent from the government.


LAW ENFORCEMENT USE

When law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line, they
will first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get
access to the communications line.  Let us assume that the tap is in
place and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with the
Clipper Chip.  The law enforcement field is first decrypted with the
family key F, giving E[K; U] + N.  Documentation certifying that a tap
has been authorized for the party associated with serial number N is
then sent (e.g., via secure FAX) to each of the key escrow agents, who
return (e.g., also via secure FAX) U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are XORed
together to produce the unit key U, and E[K; U] is decrypted to get the
session key K.  Finally the message stream is decrypted.  All this will
be accomplished through a special black box decoder.


CAPSTONE: THE NEXT GENERATION

A successor to the Clipper Chip, called "Capstone" by the government
and "MYK-80" by Mykotronx, has already been developed.  It will include
the Skipjack algorithm, the Digital Signature Standard (DSS), the
Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA), a method of key exchange, a fast
exponentiator, and a randomizer.  A prototoype will be available for
testing on April 22, and the chips are expected to be ready for
delivery in June or July.

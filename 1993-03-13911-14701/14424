It's been pointed out several times that Dorothy Denning has an apparent
trust in the FBI not shared by many of us (or many people who remember
Watergate).

In her CACM articles (March 1993), she notes:

	p.42 (right top): "none of the commentators has identified a single
	act of wiretapping abuse occurring under the current wiretapping
	statutes, which date back to 1968...."

Watergate occurred since 1968.  Nixon's enemy list was since 1968.  Granted,
this wasn't necessarily FBI behavior and may not have been related to the
statutes.  So, the argument might run that the FBI is pure and therefore
this new authority should be given to them.  However, in her main article,
she notes:

	p.29 (middle, top): "Since the FBI conducts fewer than one-third of
	all intercepts, the total benefits derived from electronic
	surveillance by all law enforcement agencies is considerably
	higher."

So, apparently, just giving the FBI permission to tap isn't good enough to
justify the legislation.  This applies to state and local law enforcement
also.  They're just as pure and uncorruptable as the FBI?

They might be.  We see the local LE abuses first hand.  We see FBI abuses
through J. Edgar's lingering PR campaign (eg., the TV series) so the FBI
looks pure to us.

Frankly I'm glad that

	P.28 (middle middle): "The [Bush] administration, the Department of
	Justice, and the FBI are all strong advocates for security in
	telecommunications networks."

I hope the Clinton administration is at least as strong an advocate for
security in telecommunications.  My approach is to use the strongest
encryption I can concoct, based on what I know and what's available to me
in order to ensure my communications security.

Now -- if only the wireless and cellular phone manufacturers would do
the same....

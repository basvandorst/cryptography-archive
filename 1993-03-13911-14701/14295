[ Stuff about IBAS deleted ]

Don't forget two factors, first, the tracks are wider than the head gap.
There is an error tolerance for head positioning. Hence if you overwrite
your data, there is a large probability that some portion of the data track
will not be overwritten. Also, head write currents are limited, and won't
fully saturate the media all the way through it thickness.

The DOD security erase on VMS overwrites the deleted data *100* times. Then
when the drive crashes, you pull out the platters and melt them.

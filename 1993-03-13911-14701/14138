	It *HAS*, many times.

	Most of the commercial packages that do hard disk encryption
on the fly *also* protect against booting with floppies, and do things
like check to make sure there aren't TSRs in place to read your password
when you 'unlock' your encrypted hard disk. Fischer Int'l's "Watchdog"
is probably the premier product in this area for PCs. It nearly got a
C2 evaluation from NCSC, but it doesn't handle the object reuse
requirements well enough. Fischer sells a board that can also go in
your PC to do DES at bus speeds for you, which also monitors bios
requests and halts the system if a virus tries to do something funny.

	There are even PCs you can buy that have it all built in,
with firmware support for boot-time password locking, and DES chips
on the disk/io controller.

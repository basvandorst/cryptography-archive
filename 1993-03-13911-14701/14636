Is there a function, that, given an arbritrary number n, will produce an
unique probably prime P(n)?  I realize that this is very similar to a
function that produces all primes, which is hard, so I will make some 
qualifications.  P(n) does not have to prime all primes, or even guarantee
anything more than probable primes.  P(n) can occasionally fail to produce
a unique probable prime.

The idea behind this is making the keyspace for RSA more dense for a given
key length.  People have remarked that 56 bit DES is may be secure while
384 bit RSA may not.  (No followups about DES/RSA security, please.  The very
fact that they are considered to be around the threshhold of security puts
them in at least the same ballpark.)  Since the keyspace of RSA is sparse,
this tranformation may make given keylengths more secure.

They failed, of course.  Seems as though that motorcade through downtown Dallas
trick only works once.

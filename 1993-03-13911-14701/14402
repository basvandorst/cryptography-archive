:   Tut, tut, Vesselin. You know the difference between factoring primes and
:   using the key generation algorithm to generate RSA keys.

:   If you don't, then I despair of anything else you might say about mathema...
:   er, arithmetic.    :-)

:I can't speak for Vesselin but I, for one, do know how to
:factorize primes.  I even have a fast constant time algorithm for
:it.


Me too!  "let Factors(n) = {1, N}"  :-)

It might be instructive to see why I wasn't able to win without a crib.  I
applied my automatic Vigenere decryptor to each of those single Vig
decryptions to see if it could automatically crack the resulting (assumed)
Vig, and then sorted all the results based on their English-likeness --
summing relative digraph frequencies (yeah, I know it probably ought to be
the log of the relative frequencies).  I stopped at key length 12 for some
reason, so it didn't get a chance to try for PROGNOSTICATE from JUXTAPOSE.
However, when it tried the Vig resulting from stripping off PROGNOSTICATE,
it gave this result:

   Key PROGNOSTICATE: BNXGI HZSAD FXFAJ BAUDY IRICJ WRCCS XMPHZ IVUQB CXOFE
		      WXXPA GASRM XBEIV VLJDF ENMPB TIRHD
   9 columns, average IC 0.064
	   Key zuenichse
   ctttafsaw eltsshuiq eeeeaacen diokenahe wamouvhna xdtcsetan ndxratotf
   elaaenube snz
   Score: 4420 5309 6182 6744 6865
	   Key juxnecose
   stateflaw ulaswhniq ueleeaven tivkinthe matoyvana ndacweman dderethtf
   ulhainnbe ing

The first key it recovers is based on sliding the alphabets back and forth
individually, and results in "zuenichse", which isn't close.  The set of
scores is the result of changing different columns based on digraphs, and
comes out better: juxnecose for JUXTAPOSE.  It's still pretty short for a
Vig, which is why it wasn't able to get the whole thing.  Unfortunately
this score of 6865 was only the 209th highest of the lot (17,866 tries),
so I never actually eyeballed it... and if I had, I might not have
recognized it.  The number one result came from ATROPOS, and looked like:

    Score: 4272 5536 6465 6848 7172 7449 7545 7668 7748 7826
	    Key vsnummmiwhny
    vtheuvndthed afncdhqunsen ttfhethewfcm heththirftot eitthhadsswc
    theceqedlpuj yjd

Maybe if I were using the log of the digraph frequencies my "th" scores
wouldn't have rewarded ones like this so highly.  Ah, well.  Next time...

Stanislaw Ulam indeed.  The real plaintext came out with a score of 6230,
which puts it much lower on the English-like scale.  Next time I'll set it
for Polish. :)

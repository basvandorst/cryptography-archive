Hi,
some weeks ago there was a discussion about signing pictures,
and make the detection/removal of such a signature difficult.
Then the discussion split in two parts:

a) find a practical way to sign a picture

b) given a robbed picture which was altered by the thieves,
   find out the thieves.

I am currently trying to do a), but do _not_ expect any results
from me.

For b) I would like to put an idea up for discussion.
Some rather well written articles showed how, by doing analysis
of the changed signatures on the robbed pictures, it is possible
to determine small or medium-sized groups of thieves that are
cooperating, if you can collect enough robbed pictures, which takes
some time.

Would it be possible by a kind of feedback to speed up the detection
of those thieves ? Just estimate the let's say top 50% of the clients
which could be thieves (which could be done by getting only a few
robbed pictures, and analyzing the signatures on them) and give them
a whole new subspace of signatures, which will help you in detect them
faster. Then do this again. And again.
(Remeber that signatures contain bits that change form signature to signature,
and bitch which have a low frequency of change, grouped after
demographic data)

Any comments how such a 'feedback cycle' could look like ?

Friendly greetings,

Hello,

Is there a crypt(3) compatible source available for MSDOS?  I have
found a bunch of sources (fcrypt and ufc) but am having trouble
porting due to the massive arrays.. surely somebody has done this
already(?) 

Any help would be very much appriciated.

Please email derry@sfu.ca if possible

Thank you.

Some other ways of killing biometric systems:

(1) Start a rumor that the system will attempt to detain unauthorized
people attempting to gain access by retaining part of their anatomy.  
The best rumors have the victim dying because they couldn't get loose
and the building was on fire  (this also has the advantage of not
having to produce the victim).

(I remember some serious discussion at one place of employment about
the impending use of card-keys to enter, among other places, restrooms,
and random drug tests; some seemed to think seriously that anything you 
put down a toilet was going to be tested and not let you out of the stall 
if you flunked the drug test).

(2) For retinal eye pattern tests, start a rumor that management can
make it burn out your retina instead of looking at the pattern.  If
I worked for certain super-secret government agencies and had a 
significant security clearance, I'd assume this to be fact, especially 
with a government that identifies itself first with concussion grenades 
on raids.

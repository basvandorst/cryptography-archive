Erm... are you sure?  Surely the output from a DES or IDEA decryption with
the wrong key will be characters equally spread over the alphabet 0..255 ?

All a chip has to do to detect a successful decrypt is see whether any
output character differs in frequency from the mean by a significant
amount.

In fact, you could probably use an RMS calculation over all the alphabet
at once to catch all deviations in parallel.

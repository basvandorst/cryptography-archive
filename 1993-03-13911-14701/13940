(I hope the spelling is right, anyway)

According to what I know of D-H encryption, it seems to be a fairly
heavy mathematical procedure: you encrypt something, hand it to your
perr who encrypts it, hands it back to you, you decrypt it and then
it goes back to your peer who decrypts it and gets the original
message.

If this is right, is there any text around on the net which details
how to choose a good function (which you can find an inverse of)
for the encryption ?

thanks,
Darren

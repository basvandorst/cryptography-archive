My apologies to Bohdan for misinterpreting his position.

Anyway, it is naive to think that you can stop people from posting what
they think by telling them to stop. The inevitable result is that they
post more. If you don't want to see a disucssion on a subject, the worst
thing you can do is send out another message on the subject.

In this case, I have no doubt that Dorothy Denning would have been
flamed unmercifully here after her CACM articles appeared, even if
the ``trial balloon'' hadn't been mentioned before.

Followups to misc.legal.computing.

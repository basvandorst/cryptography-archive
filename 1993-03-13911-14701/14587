Naive use of e.g. Unix compress might make breaking _easier_, at least if
it is easier to break DES with known plaintext.  Unix compress, and probably
some other compress/archive utilities, prefix their output with a known
magic number.  A brute force attack could benefit by having a known initial
16 or 32 bits to exact-match against instead of having to perform some more
involved test.  Who knows (rhetorical question) whether partial known plaintext
might also enable some strategy more directed and efficient than brute force?

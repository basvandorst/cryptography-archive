Yes.

It would be equivalent (if my permutation math is right) to using
the Vigenere system with some key of length 24 (24 = LCM(8,12)).  Take
the key "thequick," write it out 3 times, and then run it through
Vigenere using that 12 character key.  The result is (I think) the
key that would be used to decrypt the "doubly encrypted" message.

With the short message, and the correspondingly somewhat longer key
length, it could be more difficult to determine the key period.  But
it's probably still possible.

Check out the book "Cryptanalysis for Microcomputers," which presents
software in BASIC to break (among other things) the Vigenere system.

All of the "experts" around here will tell you that learning how
to BREAK ciphering systems is a necessary prelude to trying to
construct one that is secure.  I'm VERY distant from being an expert,
but would tend to agree.  At worst, knowing how to break some of 'em
will show you:
a) Some methods to avoid.  (Why reinvent a broken wheel?)
b) Some tests that your method will have to "pass"
c) How to use up even MORE CPU time :-).

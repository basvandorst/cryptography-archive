I recently told a friend of mine that various government agencies (FBI,
NSA, etc) were attempting to get legislation passed which would prohibit
the use of ciphers which are "unbreakable" (relatively speaking) by
the government.  He was as shocked as I had been when I first heard that
news.  Then he asked me where I had heard it.  I said "on Usenet".  Then
he said something to the effect of "well, if you believe everything you
read on Usenet ... ".  I had to admit that he had a point.

So, can someone please post or email some documents or pointers to documents
that I can use to verify this?

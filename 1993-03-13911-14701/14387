Your own words explain why they're different.  By definition, there's
no way to crack a true-random key.  But even if you don't know how
to crack MD5, or MD6, or MD-alephnull, your enemy might -- and if not
today, then tomorrow.

Yup.  That's one reason one-time pads aren't used more often.
But for key generation -- last time I was in a hobby shop, I picked
up an 8-sided die.  Generates true-random keys for me, 3 bits a roll...

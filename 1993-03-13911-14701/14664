This thread reminded me of something I was wondering about.

Let's say one sends little software ``agents'' out into the network to
collect information for whatever reason.

The idea is that you want them to report their finds back to you in a secure
manner, so that no-one can tell what you are reading (almost - certainly
those sites where the information is obtained will keep logs, etc). The point
is that the information being sent back should not be sent in the clear.

The problem is how to set up the secure reply connection in the first place.
One can't really just bury secret keys inside the agent, for the agent
(program, command script, whatever) must be sent out in the clear in the
first place in order to execute properly on whatever site it will be
executing on. 

(Note that this also implies that anyone can examine the agent
code to get an idea of what was being searched for, based on the
instructions and search parameters defined in the agent. Still, I wonder
about the possibility of setting up a secure reply channel when one had sent
the agent over an insecure channel.)

I know about systems like Kerberos, but I am thinking about the case where
the site the agent being sent to is some publicly accessible site that
anyone can access and execute things.

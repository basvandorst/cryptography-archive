No. You're flat out wrong. You shouldn't try to tell me what I meant,
since you're obviously not very good at it:

	1) the majority (at least on sci.crypt) are opposed to registration
	2) I agree with the majority, since I am also opposed
	3) I have stated so publicly, in no uncertain terms
	4) I helped start the previous flame war by posting on 10/30/92
	the following in response to Denning. (partial response):

	Denning:
	The posting about the proposal I made at the NCSC for key registration
	is essentially correct.

	me:
	This isn't just silly, it's not just drivel, it's a gross infringement
	of our civil liberties.

The simple facts are that there is no point in having another flame war.
Nobody will add any new information. It was all rehashed here a hundred
times before. Also, the flames were very one-sided, since there weren't
very many "pro registration" people posting.

Had I known how one-sided and interminable the original flame war was
going to be, I certainly wouldn't have posted my original comments.

Besides, it's not fair to Ms Denning. She's obviously from a "kinder, gentler"
era of discussion. People from that era write letters and rebuttals to CACM,
and don't participate in flame wars on the net.

I've always taken this sort of claim with more than a grain of salt.
If it is really true that one can restore *all* the data ever written
on a disk, then you would have an infinite storage device.  You could
be certain that disk manufacturers would take advantage of this
characteristic, and start selling terabyte drives.  The heck with this
CDROM silliness...

I could believe that one *may* be able to occasionally recover data
from a sector that has been overwritten once or twice by a disk system
with lots of jitter.  If I am *really* paranoid, I could overwrite the
sectors containing burn-before-reading data a couple dozen times with
random data, and there's no way in heck that anyone will recover it.

If this really is possible, I (and scads of magnetic drive
manufacturers) would love to know the physics involved in the process.
It can't simply be a matter of reading the fringes of flux changes.

I have just finish a college course on computer security and 
I am interested in obtaining any programs for deciphering common 
cipher techniques, such as caesar.  I am also looking for programs
to do Index of Coincedence, Kasiski method, vigenere table, and so on.
I have obtained the Crypt Breakers Workbench (cbw) suggested earlier, but it 
is only for the UNIX crypt command or I don't know how to use it for my purpose.

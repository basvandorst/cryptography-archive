This is probably a stupid question, but I've been tracking this list long
and I've never seen the answer. Ok here goes: How do you know you have
cracked the code right? I mean, suppose I give a crypto-analist an encrypted
tekst.. How does the crypto-analist know he has decoded the code right and
did not introduce the tekst himself? If you take a block of random data ie
you XOR it with a block data and get anything you want. 
(I hope I posed this question a bit understandably.. my English is not that
good.. )
Regards,
Wouter

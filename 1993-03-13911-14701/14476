I agree to Ralf's point.  I once broke a low-level (floppy disk) copy
protection on Apple II's 6502 as an exercise.  All I have to do was to
change a machine instruction from 'Branch on Equal' to 'Branch on Not
Equal', and the naughty program just start up nicely.  I believe to
ensure license check TECHNICALLY, the hardware vendor has to implement
certain checking routines in firmware and perform 'handshakes' with its
authorized software.  Seems unclear.  Well, perhaps the hardware
manufacturer has to provide standard low-level security check call
sequences for her software developers which ordinary users cannot bypass
during application program loads.

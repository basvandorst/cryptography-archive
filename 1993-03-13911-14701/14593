Anyone who thinks of his own rantings on sci.crypt as "USENET medicine"
counts as an idiot in my book.

Unfortunately for you, my memory is still quite good.  Among other
things, I remember you saying you had worked as a copy editor for
a newspaper in New York.  One thing they ought to have taught you there,
is not to publish assertions for which you don't have evidence. If  
Mr. Silverman claimed to be the world's authority on factoring, as you say
he did, surely you can prove that by reference to his postings to Usenet,
or his published articles, or *some* verifiable source? 


>(2) Tal says he doesn't remember Bob claiming to be the world's leading
>expert on the quadratic sieve; 

I know I'm wasting my time asking you this, but can you find 
*any* posting from Silverman where he makes this claim?

Once again, can you document your claims or is this all hot air?


>(4) Tal says he doesn't remember Bob repeatedly labelling other people's

I haven't seen him use any pejorative or dismissive term in connection with
somebody else's work.  Prove your claims.

I think Silverman made it abundantly clear on what grounds he made
assertions about the feasibility of various methods.  His predictions may
or may not be correct, but they don't appear to be wild exaggerations or 
ex cathedra proclamations.  By way of contrast, we've seen all sorts of
exaggerations, dogmatism, distortions, one-upmanship, nitpicking, and 
other assorted immaturities from your quarter.

The implicit reference to King Lear is noted; but Macbeth would be
much more to the point.  Clues for Dan: what part does Bob play, and what
does the thane have to say about idiots?

While I can't speak for Mr. Silverman, my guess is that he has a life
separate from his computer terminal and has better things to do.  Perhaps
if you unstuck your head from that volume of Knuth you're always quoting,
you might, too.

The only successful strategy I am familiar with is to make a living of
hanging out in antiquarian bookstores and to be willing to shell out at
least $100 when you happen to see one behind the counter, possibly more
if you have to bribe the store owner to not give it to the person he's
already saving it for.  Fortunately, this strategy has worked for at
least three friends of mine, so I can take a breather on my own quest
while perusing their copies.

(Don't forget to check any large libraries in your area.  The CMU
library has its own copy on a high shelf in the OVRSZ-Folio area.)

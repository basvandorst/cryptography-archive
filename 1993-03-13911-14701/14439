     None of what commentators?  The 1976 Congressional study on
wiretapping has a sizable list of known abuses.  I should have generated
a reply to her paper, but I assumed the EFF or CPSR would cover this issue,
since I know that Mike Godwin and Mark Rotenberg are well aware of the
literature on wiretapping abuse.

     A more recent reference is "LA Secret Police", by Rothmiller, who is
a former LAPD detective.  It seems that the LAPD's "Organized Crime
Intelligence Unit", where he worked for several years, spends most of 
its time snooping on celebrities, politicians, and enemies of the LAPD,
rather than organized crime, and that this snooping includes illegal
wiretaps.

     Try querying any of the big indexing systems for periodicals on
the subject "wiretap" and see what you get.  I've boxed up all my 
references on this subject and put them in dead storage, so I don't
have good cites on all this, but I could get them if someone has a 
pressing reason.

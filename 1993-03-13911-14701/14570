For something I needed, I hacked together a bit of code to act as a drop
in replacement for crypt(), producing a 128bit MD5 digest expanded to 
6bit/byte ASCII string, NULL terminated.

Now I wonder, are there any major problems with using md5 as a 
replacement for unix crypt(), specifically for user password
authentication (ie /etc/passwd).

The only one I can think of at the moment, is that MD5 digest computation 
is faster than standard crypt() and its enhanced versions. In other
words, not helping very much against current brute force attack methods.

There is also the case of an earlier sci.crypt reference to an upcoming
Eurocrypt paper which will show some weaknesses in MD5, specifically in
the area of collision resistance.

Advantages, disadvantages anyone?

Matthew.

Very precise :-) Just read my above sentence carefully :-)

Yes this is one of the consequences. I guess it will be wise to include
the recipients formal address (and eventual timestamps) in the message, as
to make it impossible for the receiver to say some months later: But you
sent me a 'Go ahead with that job' - message which was issued by the sender
x monts earlier on a completely different subject.

Naturally the recipient has to be alert of not accepting messages which
contain a wrong timestamp. Which could be caused by an enemy replaying
old messages, or by the sender who tries to create false evidence.

As the digest was created using the private key of the sender, it has a
reference to it.
Do you know a scheme of including the recipient's identity in a signature ?
This would perhaps be an interesting thing!

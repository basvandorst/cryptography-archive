As you would see if you had read the thread more closely, rathing than
looking for nits to pick (I note that your article was posted exactly 
nine minutes after your other article accusing me of amnesia),

  (a) I wrote in response to Mark Biggar's article, where no mention
      was made of using Z/pZ coefficients (or of Adi Shamir, for that
      matter), just the the general idea of interpolating a polynomial from
      its values. I pointed out some possible problems with that.
  (b) I specifically considered only the case of characteristic 0, as
      is also clear from the rest of my post which mentioned rational
      coefficients

But thanks anyway for the reference.  It's the only factual thing you've
posted here lately.

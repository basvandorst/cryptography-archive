I'm not certain I understand what exactly the concern is here.  Is the issue
that some hacker might replace a valid copy of PGP with a tampered copy that
encrypted files in a weak, easily decrypted fashion, but still provided the
same user interface, appearing to be a valid copy?  I think this is fairly
unlikely to happen.  And even if someone did it, the existence of the
tampered version would become known as soon as someone with a tampered copy
tried to exchange encrypted files with someone with a valid copy.  The
tampered copy would never spread as widely through the BBS world as the valid
one.  The fact is, PGP has already spread to many BBSes, so even if you don't
believe in the BBS community's ability to spread information about Trojans,
it would have a big headstart to overcome.  And the fact is, the BBS
community is pretty good about spreading information about Trojans and other
nasty little things that bored teenagers do...  Lastly, I'd have to say that
many well run BBSes are quite secure from any crackers getting in and messing
around with their file libraries.

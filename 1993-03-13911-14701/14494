Interesting, by the way, that USL has not been brought to task over
their "copyrighted unpublished" "trade-secret" source code in their
suit with BSDI, but never mind that...

Isn't it interesting that if, say, Lotus wanted "Notes" to be
exportable in spite of the ITARs and in spite of, it could conceivably
just deposit full copies of the source code with the Copyright office
and suddenly the information becomes what the ITARs refer to as
"Public Domain"?

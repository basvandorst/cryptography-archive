I think you're the one who hasn't been reading. When I first got wind
of Denning and her paper, I asked for a copy. I read the first draft
and began a lively debate with her by email. This was shortly before
the controversy hit the net.

Although I haven't yet seen the final version as it appeared in CACM,
I did follow several versions of her drafts. And in them she
consistently ignored or glossed over the serious objections made by
myself and many others. This was particularly true for several
fundamental questions: exactly how one would enforce a ban on the use
of unregistered keys (widespread routine monitoring of private
telephone calls?) and reconciling being compelled to divulge an
encryption key with the Fifth Amendment right against self
incrimination.

For myself, I'm not quite sure whether her position constitutes true
intellectual dishonesty, or just a dangerously naive trust in
government brought on by her associations with DoJ and FBI officials.
But given the principle of never attributing to malice that which can
be adequately explained by stupidity or ignorance, I'm inclined to
assume the latter until proven otherwise.

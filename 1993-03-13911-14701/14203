The problem I can see here is that if you are using a common 
compression agent, your compressed file would have signatures at 
fixed offsets, which could make it easier for someone trying a 
plaintext attack (of course they would still have to know that
you have used encrypted data in the first place id guess).

Then again, if you simply compress the data with some specified
algorithm, without any leading header junk, it should be OK. This
has just given me an idea, maybe even this would make things
easier for an attacker, for the particular algorithm (if its well
known), may have  specific characteristics, ie bit sequences that
never occur or compressed data layed out in a particular way
due to the word frequency of the original data.

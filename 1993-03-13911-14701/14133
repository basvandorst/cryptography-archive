Just for the ones who wonder what's the Tay Bridge.
It was build at the beginning of this century as being the
longest bridge in the world. Unfortunately due to engineers' evident
mistakes (bad materials, under-estimation of the wind force...)
the bridge failed one evening while a train was over-speeding
on it and when the wind was pretty strong. I don't remember the 
number of victims.
This is example is used to show the consequences of the design
based on un-reliable information and un-qualified personel and 
money (of course!).
Au revoir!

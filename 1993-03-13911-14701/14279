Try the special section on ``Debating Digital Telephony Legislation'',
or ``To Tap or not To Tap'', respectively, in in CACM 36 (3), March
1993, pp. 25--44.  This excellent discussion will provide you with the
standpoints of both sides concerning wiretaps on digital telephones.

The other thing that you probably mean is that when the DES will not
be reapproved for another five years (the next examnatiion is due in
1998, I thiink), it was proposed that, instead of the DES, there will
be a new encryption standard that will not be public, but instead
designed, implemented, and distributed by NSA in tamper-proof modules.
Even the keys will have to be generated and distributed by NSA.

Some people have voiced concern that NSA might substitute a weaker
scheme than DES, in particular one that NSA could break, without its
users knowing about it.  There is some basic discussion about it in
G. Simmons, "Contemporary Cryptography", IEEE Press 1992, Chapter
who-remembers, "The DES: Past, Present, and Future.".

Hope this helps.

US hams are constrained from using any technique which obscures the
content of the communication.  That extends to only being allowed to
use specific CCIR alphabets, etc.  Only certain spread-spectrum
generators are allowed.  No encryption.

Standard telephony does just fine with a 300-3000 Hz. range.  I've used
the zero-crossing technique, and it's workable, but not too swift.
OTOH, it doesn't take too many bits of resolution to make a big
improvement in the voice quality.  I'd guess that you could get pretty
good speech down a 14.4 modem.

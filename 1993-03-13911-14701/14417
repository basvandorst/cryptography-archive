A good compressor will try to make sure that all are equally represented
or you could compress it more.  Also you detector chip would be buzzing
all the time. Teh distribution of the most used and the least used
character in a random equal probability stream is very skewed in its
distribution, ans has a reasonable probabliltiy of being "way out".
(anyone know the distribution, say for a 96 letter alphabet?)

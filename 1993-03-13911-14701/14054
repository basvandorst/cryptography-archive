With a little help from a human operator this should be no problem. Just
let a human make let's say 50 distinct changes to the pictures, adding a
freckle, moving or deleting a hair, changing the shade of a shadow, moving
a contour by one pixel (as various examples proposed...) and then let
a machine combine them. 2^50 gives you plenty of different version-numbers,
even the possibilitiy to use 32-bit data + 18 bit error correcting code :-)
So even if lossy compression is used, chances are high, that you can recombine
your ID-mark.

(By the way, how many bit of signature would be recoverable if one uses 20
data digits and 30 checksum-digits ? Would a Reed-Solomon-ECC be of use here,
and how much could we correct ?)

P.S. This is the second posting of two identical postings. Could please a
kind soul tell me, if there are two versions of this article on the net ?
I have the strong suspicion that the news-distributer I used for the last
few postings did _not_ post my articles to the net. Which would be rather
annoying!

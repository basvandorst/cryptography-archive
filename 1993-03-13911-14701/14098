First, I'd recommend going to your local technical book store (which
I'd expect to find in university towns) and looking through any text
books you can find on the subject of cryptography.  Most such texts
include either a reprint of the DES standard, or else describe it in
complete detail.

Failing that, since the standards themselves are not export restricted,
you can order them from various sources in the USA, and shipment via
air carrier can be arranged.

You probably want (some of) the following standards.

The following standards may be ordered from the 
	U.S. Department of Commerce, National Technical Information Service, 
	Springfield, VA 22161.

	FIPS PUB 46-1 "Data Encryption Standard"  (this is DES)
	FIPS PUB 74   "Guidelines for Implementing as Using the NBS DES"
	FIPS PUB 81   "DES Modes of Operation"
	FIPS PUB 113  "Computer Data Authentication" (using DES)

	FIPS means "Federal Information Processing Standard"
	The two most vital ones are 46-1 and 81.

The following standards may be ordered from the 
	American National Standards Institute Sales Office, 
	1430 Broadway, New York, NY 10018.

	ANSI X3.92-1981  "Data Encryption Algorithm" (identical to FIPS 46-1)
	ANSI X3.106-1983 "DEA Modes of Operation"    (identical to FIPS 113)

Notes:  I believe these documents cost $12 each plus shipping.
	Figure 3 in FIPS PUB 46-1 is in error, but figure 3 in X3.92-1981
	is correct.  The text is correct in both publications.

Finally, there are private companies that sell many of these publications.
One of these with whom I have done business in the past is 
	Global Engineering Documents 
	2805 McGaw Avenue, PO Box 19539, Irvine, CA, 92714
	Phone (714) 261-1455
I have used their service in the past, and I know they can arrange
overnight delivery.  I have no relationship with this company, except
as a satisfied customer.

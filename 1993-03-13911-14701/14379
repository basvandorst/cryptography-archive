Sorry about the false lead.  My notes said cs-bbs.nist.gov was
129.6.54.30 with an ftp login of <bbs> and password <bbs>.  It does no
longer seem to be answering.  Sorry again.

Mark Murphy (mmurphy@iat.holonet.net) suggested:

>>you can get SHA C source from wimsey.bc.ca in /pub/crypto

and someone else suggested csrc.ncsl.nist.gov.  I also show a
speckle.ncsl.nist.gov at 129.6.59.2 which was (?)  supporting anonymous
ftp and may or may not have the FIPS docs.  Best bet is to call NIST or
the NTIS directly if these all fail.

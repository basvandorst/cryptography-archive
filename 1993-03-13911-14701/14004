The address is 149.132.2.1, but the reason you have all been getting
"host unknown" messages is because if internet troubles in the vicinity.
It appears to have affected all of ghost's DNS servers, making even
its name unreachable.

Again, just so there's no typo, it's ghost.dsi.unimi.edu (149.132.2.1).

Also, it's not there yet as I write this.  I said you should look on sunday
for a reason, and that's that we need all of saturday!

If you're using this method on a short cryptogram, be sure to do something
clever with the letters that <aren't> in the overlap -- otherwise you're
wasting that text.  On a longer cryptogram you don't need it, since the
effect will be striking and unambiguous.

This is also a nice method to use when you have a long period, but don't
have a bunch of periods to work with.  For example, if we had 1.5 or so
full LCM periods of the double Vigenere we've been talking about, sliding
two copies of it against each other as Carl suggests would show a peak at
the place where the ciphertext was encrypted with the same pair of keys.
My stricture above doesn't apply to this case, since the text outside the
overlap was not encrypted twice with the same pair of keys.

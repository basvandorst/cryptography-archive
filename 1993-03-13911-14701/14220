	I've had several requests by email for pointers to Fischer Int'l
Watchdog. Rather than answer them all, I'll just post the information
here. 

	Fischer International
	4073 Merchantile Ave
	Naples, Florida 33942
	(800)237-4510
	(800)331-2866 (FL)

	Watchdog includes (from the back of the cover)
	ID and password control to protect access
	Keylock that locks the PC when left unattended
	User access permission levels including r/w/x create and delete
	Automatic encryption of network programs and data
	System boot and format protection
	Virus protection
	Audit trail

	It is export controlled.

	For what it's worth, if you're getting into a paranoid frame of
mind, there are literally *dozens* of products that do this kind of stuff.
There are also dozens of relatively inexpensive DES-encrypting modems
and telephone devices. AT&T makes a neat toy that plugs into the handset
of your phone and automatically does DES when you push a button. There
are loads of similar products - good places to look are in the various
infosec rags. I'll post a few pointers when I get a chance later.

mjr.

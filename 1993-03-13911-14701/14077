	A trivial instance of this was a picture of Jupiter I got off the
net a couple years ago.  The image looked clean, but when I happened to
glance at the tail end of the PostScript-formatted version, I saw some 01s
nestled among a field of 00s.  Changing them to a brighter intensity produced
NASA's serial number for the image in the lower right corner.

	I'm also reminded of a truly bad movie from the early 70's, titled
something like "The Advertizers" (no flames, please, I only saw part of it
once, I'm not *sure* that's the title).  SPOILER ALERT!!!!

The evil corporation decides to embed subliminal messages in commercials by
overlaying images, e.g. 99% obvious image, 1% hidden image.  Your mileage
may vary.

You can't factor a prime, a prime has only two factors, 1 and itself.

The 'key generation algorithm' you are trying to invert boils down to
'pick two 512-bit primes'.

So if we had a table of (N,[P,Q]) pairs for all the possible 1024-bit
moduli, we could 'crack' RSA.  When someone posts their public key
(giving us their N) we could look up P and Q.  (I don't even have to
store Q, because once I know P I can divide to find Q.)

But how big is that table going to be?

Another poster said that, assuming a 1024-bit modulus, there are 2^503
primes and that there are 10^85 atoms in the universe.

2^503 is between 10^151 and 10^152.  

1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
times too big to even contemplate storing.

What a lot of people seem to be talking about here is hiding
something in a digital image which could later be used as a 
signature.  The problem is that almost any simple image processing
algorithm (such as median filtering or the addition of white
noise) would change the image enough to wipe out the signature.
Future posters with ideas for encoding permanent signatures in
digital images should keep this in mind when presenting their methods.

You hit the nail on the head! Wiretap abuses are a problem precisely
because they're so hard to detect.

Which leads to a possible solution. I would be willing to give the
police much broader authority to conduct wiretaps if they would all
agree to be monitored 24 hours/day with permanently implanted
microphones. This would allow quick detection and punishment of any
abuses of their authority. (We'd probably have to add fingertip sensors
too, so we can tell what they're typing).

As long as they don't break the rules, they would have nothing to
hide, and no legitimate reason to oppose being monitored, right?

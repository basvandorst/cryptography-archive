As I recall, Navajo had another advantage besides its obscurity.
It was a vocal only, not written language, thus rather difficult
to go learn from a textbook.

I believe there is a book _Code_Talkers_ about the people involved. One
problem was the resulting losses decimated the Tribe's population of
draft-age men, with aftereffects of that felt for decades.

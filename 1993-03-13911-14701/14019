I've just downloaded and compiled PGP 2.2 for both a Sun Sparc 2 and
80386-based MS-DOS machine and I must admit it is much nicer than
before!

I haven't done extensive testing and my keyring is quite small, so
many of the new features I haven't been able to test.  However, I do
like the multiple recipient feature but I think a small change would
make it a little easier to use.

In the current way, you can only specify multiple recipient encryption
via commandline.  What would be nice is for PGP 2.2, in the prompt
mode, to continuously prompt for additional users to encrypt the file to
until, say, a blank return is pressed.

This way, when somebody calls up pgp via some shell (say Windows), the
prompt mode can handle multiple recipients without a hitch.  I don't think
such a change would be very major and would make pgp multiple recipient
encryption a little easier to use.

I haven't experienced any bugs with the basic features, but I don't do
anything fancy like "eyes only" or weird pagers when I use pgp.

Kudos to the pgp development team!

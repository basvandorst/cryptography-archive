Here's something I posted a couple of years ago.

I have here a publication ``Advisory Memorandum on Office Automation
Security Guideline'' [sic], NTISSAM COMPUSEC/1-87, 16 January 1987,
with a logo for ``National Telecommunications and Information Systems
Security.''  The gobbledygook at the beginning states that ``This
NTISSAM may be used or quoted without restriction''.  Let me quote
what they say on the subject:

        Magnetic remanence is the residue remaining on magnetic storage
        media after a file has been overwritten or the media have been
        degaussed.  Many times, after a file has been overwritten or media
        have been degaussed, it is still possible for someone with
        physical possession [as opposed to demonic possession?] of the
        media to recover the information that was formerly present.  This
        magnetic remanence, therefore, is a major vulnerability...
        For more detailed guidance, please see [a publication which
        is restricted, though not classified].

        Clearing of magnetic media refers to a procedure by which the
        classified information recorded on the media is removed, but the
        totality of declassification is lacking.  Clearing is a procedure
        used when magnetic media will remain within the phyiscal
        protection of the facility in which it was previously used.
        Declassification refers to a procedure by which all classified
        information recorded on magnetic media can be totally removed.
        Declassification is required when magnetic media which have ever
        contained classified data are to be released outside of a
        controlled environment.

        Certain types of removable media ... may be cleared by overwriting
        the enire media one time with any one character.  Floppy disks may
        be cleared by applying a vendor's formatting program that
        overwrites each location with a given character.

        Fixed media should be cleared by overwriting at least one time
        with any one character.  [No word on whether or not that character
        is classified...]  One way to do this is by applying a vendor-
        supplied formatting program that overwrites each location on the
        disk with a given character, if it can be shown that this program
        actually works as advertised.  The user should beware:  some
        programs that purport to overwrite all locations do not actually
        do this.

        ...

        Certain types of removable media can be declassified using a
        degaussing device that has been approved for declassifying media
        of that type.  (A list of approved devices is maintained by NSA.)

        If a fixed medium is operative, an approved method of
        declassifying the disk pack is to employ an overwrite procedure
        which must overwrite all addressable locations at least three
        times by writing any character, then its complement (e.g., binary
        ones and binary zeros) alternately.

It goes on to discuss disassembling disk packs so that you can use
the degaussers, having trusted couriers take defective packs to the
vendor and watching while they disassemble it, etc.

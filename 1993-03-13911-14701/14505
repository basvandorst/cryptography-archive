Do any of those collections actually work?  I retrieved the file
macpgp2.2.cpt.hqx from "plaza.aarnet.edu.au" (our local archie
server, as it happens) for a Mac mate of mine, and he says that
although it appears to be a Mac file, it contains no resources
(I forget the terminology he used).

Yes, I retrieved it properly etc.

I see that four of them have the same length (312726), but there is
another file called MacPGP2.2 that is 312730 bytes, at demon.co.uk.

Now, I'm in Australia, and I don't like beating on the international
links too much (they're busy enough with FTP traffic as it is) and my
FTP access is via a mail gateway, so...

Can someone point me to a Mac PGP that is known to work?  Ta muchly.

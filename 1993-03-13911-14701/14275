    Devices for fingerprint recognition should better be equipped to
    distinguish between a real live thumb, a cut-off one, and a cast of
    a fingerprint.  Otherwise, it could get really scary.

When I was little I experimented with letting a layer of Elmer's
glue dry on my fingertips, peeling it off, and using the peeled
impression to leave fake fingerprints on things.  It seemed to
work pretty well though I don't know if it would have fooled
anyone with real instruments who was looking for this kind of scam.
I remember thinking that the crime of the century could be pulled
off by "stealing" someone's fingerprints this way.  Of course that
leaves out a few details like how to do it without their noticing.

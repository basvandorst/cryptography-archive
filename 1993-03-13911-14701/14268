Yes and no...  I believe that the actual legislation they were supporting
had to do with making american manufacturers of telephone and communication
equipment put in taps that various government agencies could use at will
(the actual legislation does not say it in this language, but no one has
ever refused a tap and the FBI can't point to an example of one that was
thwarted for technical reasons at the switch, so it seems reasonalbe to
assume that they want to be able to do it without having to tell the phone
company...) 

The part about putting holes in crypto packages sounds to me more like what
Dorothy Denning has proposed regarding makeing registration of crypto keys
a requirement.

Take a look at this months issue of Communications of the ACM (March 93)
for a few arguements pro and con on these issues and some general background.
When the proposal was first made there was a lit of press in the various
computer trade rags, particularly the telephony and networking ones.

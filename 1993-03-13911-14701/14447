You're asking too little. Non-technical key registration discussions
don't belong ``here'' on sci.crypt in any case. I don't know about
alt.security.pgp, but there are groups such as misc.legal.computing
which were _meant_ to carry such traffic. (Followups there.)

Now, what you meant wasn't ``Don't discuss key registration here: it
belongs on misc.legal.computing.'' What you meant was ``Please, oh
sci.crypt readers, stop talking about key registration---my political
views disagree with those of the majority, and I can't bear to see my
assumptions challenged. Please shut up.''

But this is USENET. You can't shut people up on USENET. On USENET
people read ``shut up'' and think ``shout up.''

Key registration will never work.

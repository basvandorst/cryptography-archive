The problem with trying to find publicized "abuses" of wiretapping
is that its a catch-22 -- I think that's precisely the problem with
wiretapping, is that it is inherently surreptitious! If it weren't
maybe there would be many fewer problems! It also wouldn't be
wiretapping :)  I think the greatest abuses of wiretapping are 
probably always yet to be uncovered. (But for famous cases one can look 
at the woes of two members of the British Royal family.)

Seriously, I thought Bamford in the Puzzle Palace did a good job of
citing all the abuses of "interception" on the international level,
and some domestic-type tapping that went on. The fact is that a lot
of really serious violations were uncovered only after the NSA was
doing a lot of CYA from a request by the defense in a student 
activist organization asked for any evidence that was obtained against
the defendants from wiretapping or surreptious means. It was a 
fishing expedition that paid off and sent the cryptbreaker bureacrats 
screaming for cover.

History shows that the stuff only comes to light almost completely
by accident.  Its amazing how much monitoring of telegram
traffic was going on...

I don't know why Denning continues to pursue publicly her
humiliating position. (Deserves to be called a case of dogged
Sternlighting...)

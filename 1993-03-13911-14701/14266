+Doesn't this leave the smart card itself as a vulnerable item?  For

It's easy to bootstrap it by cryptographically signing (or encrypting)
the biometric data that's stored on the smart card.  It should be
simple to do that during enrollment/card creation, since presumably
providing physical security then is easy.

If the data is simply signed, the verifier must have access to the
public key to verify the signature on the biometric data, and that
requires only integrity, not privacy.  If a private key system was
used to encrypt the data, then you need both integrity and privacy for
the verifier.

On the other hand, if you only signed the biometrics and the data is
world readable, then it makes it easier for somebody to simply cut the
wires to the biometric sensor (pen, in this case) and inject the
appropriate signals into the system.  Or drive a robot hand with the
data.  Just like having passwords stored in the clear.

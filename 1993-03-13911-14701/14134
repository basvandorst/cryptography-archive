Isn't a ram disk good enough?

It's very easy to set up a batch file that will copy a pgp encrypted
wordprocessor file to a ram disk, decrypt it there, load it into a
wordprocessor, re-encrypt it when you're finished, and then copy the new
ciphertext file back to the hard disk.

I've got a shell program that lets me launch wordprocessor files from a
menu, and I use the batch file I described above to do the launching. 
That way, one you've taken the trouble to set things up, it really isn't
much more of a hassle than it would be if you weren't using pgp.  I still
need to make a macro that will allow me to load new files from within
wordperfect, but I don't expect that will be very difficult either. 

The only thing that was a hassle for me was figuring out how to get
wordperfect to write it's temp files to the ram disk (I don't have a
manual);  but you just use a /d-[dirname] switch when you start it up.  If
you use shroom as I do, you also have to make sure that you tell it to
write it's data to the ram disk when you shell to dos.

In e-mail, a reader suggested that my observation here:

is misleading, because by choosing enough books and starting points to XOR
into a running key, one gets a random distribution, for all practical
purposes.  I don't disagree, but I assert that it's not random for all
<theoretical> purposes.  Remember that Vernam encryption means that there
is absolutely no theoretical way that a recovered plaintext can be
distinguished from any other plaintext of the same length: that any two
English (say) sentences of the same length are equally likely in the Vernam
encryption space.

Here's a meta-order-of-magnitude argument...  I'm just trying to get the
order of magnitude of the order of magnitude close.  The UCLA Library has
about 10^7 texts in it, I think... let's say there are around 10^8 texts
we can choose from.  Suppose we randomly select 10 of these texts for our
keyword.  The number of ways we can do this is C(10^8, 10).  If my
arithmetic is close, this is around 10^74.  Then in each of these books we
can start anywhere -- say they've each got 10^7 different starting points,
so we've got perhaps 10^82 different potential keys.

Now consider how many different possible messages we might encrypt.  If we
assume a 100-character alphabet, there are 100^100 different messages of
100 bytes in length, or 10^200 -- many more possible messages than the
total number of possible keys.  Put another way, the space of potential
encryptions of a given text of this length is sparse.  This means that if the
cryptanalyst <does> hit on the right set of keys, he's likely to recognize
it.  For Vernam encryption, he can't possibly recognize it, because the
space of potential encryptions is 100% dense.

Note that this a big enough keyspace to (probably) cover the space of
10^20 10-letter messages... the 10^82 keys will certainly decrypt a
message of that length into lots of English words -- probably most of
them.  And as you increase the number of texts in your keyword collection,
the length of message you can expect to protect goes up.  However, for any
library, set of keytexts, and set of starting points, there is a length of
message that will not be perfectly protected... even if my arithmetic is
wrong above.  This is not the case for Vernam encryption, which is
theoretically absolutely uncrackable.

Again, this is a theoretical discussion: practically speaking, there are
lots of ciphers that will adequately protect your diary, and combining
enough books and starting places is one of them.

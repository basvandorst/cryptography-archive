stuff

I am working on a protocol based on algebraic properties of one-way
functions, and am looking for a good *source* to describe hard to 
invert, yet algebraic [as opposed to XOR'd] functions. The only
suitable examples I have seen are based on modular arithmetic
[discrete logarithms, quadratic residues].  Are there others?

Alec

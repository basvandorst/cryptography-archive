The problem with RC2 (and RC4) is that the algorithms are secret.  No one
really knows how secure it is.  If you want some real opinions, buy a
product that already has RC2 installed, disassemble the source code (can't
be that hard), and post the algorithm on the net.  You'll get opinions.

Otherwise, all we can go by is secondhand information.  I would believe
RSADSI's claims about speed versus DES.  Remember that DES was designed for
hardware, not sofware.  There are parts of that algorithm that are a real
pain to implement in software.  I also believe RSA that speed is independent
of key size.  That's not hard to do, and I assume it pretty easy to verify
(so RSADSI can't get away with lying).

As to RC2's security compared to DES, I have no idea.  It's possible.  Not
enough people have examined the algorithm to make an assessment.

As to your last question, keep in mind that the NSA is allowing the export of
RC2 with a 40-bit key.  How strong do YOU think it is?

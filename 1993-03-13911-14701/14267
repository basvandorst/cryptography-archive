i met with dorothy denning not long after the flap here in sci.crypt
and my sense of the matter was that she *had* considered the arguments
presented, that she had weighed the matter and had come to the
conclusion that she thought that law enforcement was more important
that nebulous theories about putative loss of privacy.

furthermore, she was aware of most of the arguments presented on the
net before they were presented on the net (and re-presented and
re-re-presented), and just didn't agree.

she absolutely did not give me the impression of any dishonesty.
rather by spending the time to talk to me, she gave the impression of
wanting very hard to consider all sides of the issue.

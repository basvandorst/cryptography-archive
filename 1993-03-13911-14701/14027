That's why God invented contracts.

Really?  Perhaps you should discuss that with Microsoft or some other
software vendor.  Tell them you are going to put their software on a
computer that is accessible from anywhere on the Internet and you
don't intend to take precautions against copying because there is no
law stating that you HAVE to protect your directories.

People are used to protecting programs.  Getting them to protect data
is only marginally tougher.

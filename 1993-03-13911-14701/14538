Ah.  I did one of those a few years back.  It was interesting.

Frequencies of names vary not only from culture to culture, but also
from birth-year to birth-year.

You probably want 1950-1980, I guess.  

I couldn't find a good source of date-correlated frequencies, but I
did have a pretty good source of general frequencies (overweighted
towards people older than I really cared about).  I'll see if I can
find it on a tape somewhere.

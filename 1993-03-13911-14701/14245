One more argument to use bulk disk encryption. Then the attacker must
break the encryption before any attempts to restore deleted files.

I know of no commercial system that is able to do that. Military
systems - I don't know. But the best that can be done with a
commercial system is to restore the contents of the hard disk after a
low level format. Not if you have overwritten it with something else,
however...

Read carefully. I don't attack him, but the content of his messages. That is
not an ad hominem.

I would not normally have held that particular message up to the light, but
after Metzger's many messages calling me a liar, and worse, I thought I'd be
allowed a little leeway here in responding. Apparently not.

And how would you take someone who deliberately distorts your words, smears
you, and calls you a liar repeatedly in public? I think I've been very
restrained in the face of this to continue to comment on his messsages
instead of his character, given his behavior here.

 DA> Thank you for the post..  I thought it was an excellent article!

Much as many of us have disagreed with Mr. Sternlight in the past on
various issues, I agree with Derek here; the article was, indeed,
excellent, and was a good contribution to the whole net.discussion of
cryptography (in particular, public-key crypto).

It also points out that even those who disagree with RSA, their patents, or
their approach can still find some common cause with them (namely reform of
the US export control laws), which is something to keep in mind.

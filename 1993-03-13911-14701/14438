In that case, you are still committing a logical fallacy, because the
content of one message by me is only connected with the contents of
other messages by me by virtue of my being the author of all of them.
I could in one message post nothing but truth and in another nothing
but pernicious lies -- the truthful message would still not suffer
from association with the author of the false message.

This is a new logical fallacy, David. I've never heard anyone attempt
this one before. Most people don't attempt to justify ad hominem
attacks by taking them onto this new level.

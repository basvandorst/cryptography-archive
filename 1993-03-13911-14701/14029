[Map companies move around details on the map so that anyone simply copying 
or digitizing their map will retain the same detailed changes.  These 
changes take the form of moving a road junction or a small town slightly.  
Some vague memory I have says that additional invalid data is created, which 
if replicated indicates copying.]

I know this very well. Until recently almost all maps of Aurora, Ilinois showed an extra street (it had been platted but did not exist) near where I live. This caused people looking for my home to become very lost.

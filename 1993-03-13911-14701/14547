I've been reading here and on sci.math.*  for a while, and I don't 
remember him making any such claims.  Can you cite any?

I don't remember seeing this either.  Any proof?

Let me refresh your memory.  What he actually wrote, in message
<1993Mar24.151620.1545@linus.mitre.org>, was:

   I have (likely) factored more numbers with NFS than you have.
   That is certainly true if one restricts to published results. Noone
   else can of course say what you might have done in private.
   But your arrogance in implying what I might or might not have done
   with respect to NFS is wearing thin. Grow up Dan, and learn to stop
   insulting your colleagues in public. Or soon you'll have no colleagues.

Note Silverman's use of the qualifier "likely", reserving the word
"certainly" to the comparison of published results -- his claims about the
latter being *verifiable*, in contrast to your various rhetorical thrusts.
Note his openmindedness in admitting the possibility that you *might* have
done more than he in private, in contrast to your belligerent idiocy.  And
where did Silverman say he's done more NFS factorizations than *anyone*
else -- all he said was he *likely* did more than you have.


>You state your wild guesses in public as if they were established facts,
>so long as they support your current theories. 

As opposed to the model of rational discourse afforded by your own
postings.  As for them being "wild guesses", Silverman has stated many
times that his claims about the capabilities of various methods are based
in part on extrapolation to larger size numbers from the large body of
data he and others have accumulated for smaller numbers.  That hardly
seems like a wild guess.

I think you ought to provide his full statement, in context, if you want
your claim to be at all plausible.

What an idiot.

As a former member of ANSI Approved Standards Committee X3 - Computing
Standards (under which most data comm standards fell) and working from
memory I believe the following to be true:

1) DES has already expired as a formal standard. Standards need to be
re-approved every seven years and DES expired a number of years ago.

2) The NSA proposal for 'trust us' crypto algorythms which are not
revealed were not postivly looked upon.  Indeed, they probably do not
meet the general criteria ANSI imposes on standards --  fully revealed
and freely available. I remember one meeting when this was discussed.
I brought up the probability of trap doors in the algorythm. The guy
from 'the Department of the Army' (probably read NSA) just squirmed
uncomfortably in his seat.

My read on this is the spooks will keep pushing for 'trust us'.  The
big companies on the committee (DEC, IBM, etc.) never wanted to take
them on as they were not spoiling for a fight with customers.  But
they knew what the spooks were trying to do.

Anyone can comment on proposed standards.  Any organization can sit
on X3.  Contact X3 Secretariat, CBEMA (Computer Business Equipment
Manfacturers Association), Washington, DC. for information on how to
get your input into the cycle.

Better yet, if you are connected with a member organization (like DECUS
or SHARE), let your standards rep know you don't want the government
freely spying on your e-mail, financial transactions, health records,
political activities, etc.

About 5 years ago, the NSA had a representative at a session on security
at a DECUS Symposium.  I questioned the wisdom of the ITARs and and
comdemed NSAs attitudes.  To the consternation of the NSA rep, I received
prolonged applause and cheers from the about 600 DECUS members present!

"The Price of Liberty is Eternal Vigilance"  We can win this battle if
we keep up the pressure.  Otherwise, those who would have the government
with all powerful spying tools will win.  Is Big Brother in our future?
Only if we let him!

Contact your DECUS or SHARE standards rep today (DECUS has e-mail --
decus.org,  I don't know about SHARE (the IBM group)).  E-mail
the White House (someone will have to post the White House's Compu$erv
address).  "Just Do It" -- Thomas Jefferson(?) ;)

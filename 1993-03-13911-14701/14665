 Hummmm... agent X distribution... Well, a thinking experiment, yes?

Well, you admit people are going to be able to look at the code... so anyone
can decide what the messages 'really' are no matter what... IF they look at
the code.  IF they don't, then the problem is how to camouflage the
information... ie. the information is not what it APPEARS to be.

If you want real security, you just can't do what you say you want to do.
You can only make it a little harder for someone to figure out what you are
trying to do.

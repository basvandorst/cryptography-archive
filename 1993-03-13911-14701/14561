The Copyright Office says: ``Though registration is not a condition for
securing copyright, delaying the effective date of registration can have
serious consequences. In an infringement suit, the court may not award
statutory damages or attorney's fees if the infringement started before
the effective date of registration---unless, for published works,
registration was made within a grace period of 3 months following
publication and the infringement started after first publication.''

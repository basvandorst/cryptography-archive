Here is a summary of the responses to my request for references on
automated cryptanalysis. There is obviously some interest in the
topic judging from the number of requests for this summary. So I 
decided to post the summary. I will also email those who 
requested it.

Summary of automated cryptanalysis of simple ciphers
references March 14, 1993.

CODE:
- the Cryptographers Workbench from comp.sources*
	[ I couldn't find this. Does anyone have further information?
	e.g. Which c.s.* newsgroup, and what is its archive name. ]

- From Alec Chambers:
	There is an MS-DOS software package available for
	PCs called Cipher-Ace.  It does most classical ciphers.
	Write to:

OTHER INFORMATION:
- From Mike Dority:
I don't have the information with me here at work, but the American
Cryptographic Association has a Computer Supplement and a group that
is a "use of computers" group and there are at least two members who
have put out programs that are almost totally hands off (dictionary
lookup).

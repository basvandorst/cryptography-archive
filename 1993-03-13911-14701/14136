Not long, as it happens.  The method is called "Vigenere", and it's easy
to decrypt.  If it's long enough, it can be decrypted automatically, and
even quite short ones can be decrypted by using standard methods.

No, that's long enough.  Running an index of coincidence on the thing shows
the period is 8 -- that's the first major peak -- meaning that there are
120/8 = 15 full periods.  Plenty for a Vigenere.  Running my automatic
Vigenere/Beaufort/Variant Vigenere/Porta program on it suggests that the
key is "theqwiik" and gives pretty good text.  Trying it with key "thequick"
gives the correct plaintext:

According to Kahn's "The Codebreakers", this version of the Vigenere
cipher had an excellent reputation for strength when it was developed in
the 16th century, but even then it was being broken.  Period determination
was an art, though, until the Kasiski method of determining period by
looking at repeated n-graphs allowed finding the period easily for
moderately long or repetitive ones.  Friedman's invention of the Index of
Coincidence, a much more sensitive tool, definitively solved the period
problem.

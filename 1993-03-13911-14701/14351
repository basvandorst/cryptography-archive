When discussing the security of encryption algorithms it is often
mentioned that the sheer number of possible keys makes them highly
resistant to brute-force attacks. One recent posting indicated that
for a 512-bit key there are more keys than atoms in the observable
universe. From a theoretical perspective, it seems impossible to try
them all.

But I suggest that practice has the potential of being more forgiving
than theory. You *might not* have to try them all before you find the
right one. Here's a simple analog: I live in an apartment complex with
300 units. The door keys have 5 pins and 6 pin lengths - the number of
possible keys is what, 5^6 = 30625 keys? I cut 100 different keys at
random. I try them out one by one. Move on to the next door. *Probability*
says I will not be successful, but what if I am? (The residents will
complain that the locks are not secure...)

So you pregenerate a million RSA key pairs, and try them all on a given
message. Use 10 machines in parallel. Maybe a message *will* be cracked,
and maybe it won't. But if one *is* cracked, it didn't take a billion
theoretical years, did it?

Does this "scenario" have an academic name? It certainly must be
common knowledge amongst cryptographers, who most likely put it on 
the back burner, as nothing can be done about it. But is the general
public, the end users, missing out on something when they hear how secure
algorithm 'foo' is?   "Yes, Snorton DiskReet uses DES and it has 2^56
possible keys and your data is SECURE! Just type in your 8 letter
password and it will take a thousand years to break!"

I believe that the original poster is referring to recertification by
NIST for government use.  As I mentioned in another posting, the
review is still in progress, but DES is likely to be reaffirmed.

My own personal reading is that ironically enough, a lot of doubts were
laid to rest by the Biham/Shamir attack.  It made it very clear that
the S-boxes -- long the most mysterious part of DES -- had actually been
strengthened, not weakened, and that a trapdoor was thus quite unlikely.

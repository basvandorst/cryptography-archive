	Of course there are not that many *known* primes; but given any number
	N, you can efficiently test whether N is prime.  So the idea is to
	generate brand new primes every time you want a new key.  If you
	generate a odd random number R and start testing R,R+2,R+4,... until
	you find a prime, you will have a prime that is infinitesimally likely
	to have ever been generated or tested before by anyone (and the total
	number of known primes in the world will have increased by one).


We've been told before that the mathematicians have high confidence in these
approximate primality-testing algorithms.  But what I'm wondering is have
any of you guys who regularly factor big primes ever taken a large number
of these 'probably' prime numbers and tried to factor them, to get
experimental confirmation of the maths?  I just have this gut feeling
that if you pick a 512-bit number, and it passes the clever tests for
primality, it's going to turn out to be a product of two 256-bit numbers.

Now, I know the mathematicians say this ain't so, but I don't understand
the maths and have to take their word for it.  So has anyone tried any
experimental confirmation?  I know its not feasible to factor tens of
thousands of really big pseudo-primes, but if the same algorithms work
down at the 100-bit end perhaps with the same degree of error, maybe a
few thousand of those would help add some confidence?

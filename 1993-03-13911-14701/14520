You're exactly right!  If I want to make an RSA key, I have to go find
my own prime numbers.

How do I get a prime number that's got so many digits?

Simple!  I pick a random (odd) number that has the right number of
digits, and I check if it's prime.  No good?  Ok, try again.  No good?
Ok, try again.  And keep going.

I WILL find one -- pretty soon in fact!  There are very many numbers
in that range, and primes are pretty common.  There are about 2^506
primes that are 512 bits long.  Picking a random number in that range
thus has about a one in 512 or one in 256 chance of being prime.  I'm
not sure of my math and I'm not sure of the 2^506 figure, but anyway
you can find plenty of primes whenever you want them.

I suppose you should pick your random numbers in a good,
cryptographically-strong manner, like the old radioactive-decay
method, but I don't know how crucial that is..

See your nearest number theory textbook for details.

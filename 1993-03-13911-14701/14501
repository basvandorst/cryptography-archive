This message (and the other one you posted) apparently refer to the
standalone file encryption feature in Norton's DISKREET. I was more
interested in its encrypted virtual disk mode. I already have lots of
other ways of encrypting individual files (e.g., my own DES program,
which I already trust, and PGP, which I trust almost as much since
source is available for all to scrutinize).

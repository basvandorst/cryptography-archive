   It took a while after the release was finished to actually get
   a megabyte and a bit to several places around the world, but
   you might have a look for PGP 2.2 in:

   nic.funet.fi:pub/msdos/incoming
   garbo.uwasa.fi:pc/incoming
   src.doc.ic.ac.uk:tmp/pgp

Also black.ox.ac.uk:/src/security

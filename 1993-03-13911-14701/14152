Not at all. Encryption (or decryption) is usually a polynomially-hard
problem, while exhaustive search on the key is usually an
exponentially-hard problem. To give you a simple example: If my
processor speed increases by a factor of two, I can afford to run DES
twice on my data (yes, I know the recommended way is to do triple-DES,
encrypting with key A, decrypting with key B, re-encrypting with key
A; I'm trying to make a point).

Essentially, I've doubled my key length while maintaining my
encryption time constant. But doubling the key length from 56 to 112
bits has made the codebreaker's task 2^55 times harder (2^56 divided
by 2). I think I win, after all.

Well, consider two possible mitigating factors:

1)  She may not read this newsgroup.  (I recall seeing no posts from her and
  I've monitored faithfully for the last calendar quarter, at least).

2)  Publications, especially peer-reviewed ones, often have long lead times.
  A relevant question is:  When did she write this?  The publication date means
  nothing in particular.

I'd hold my fire until such factors are cleared up.

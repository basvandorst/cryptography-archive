The story is true, and can be found in

	David Kahn
	"The Codebreakers"
	Macmillan, 1967, now out of print
	(make sure you get the *unabridged* edition,
	the NAL paperback is useless)

in a chapter near the end, probably the one entitled (approximately)
"Businessman, Rumrunners, and the Makers of Nonsecret Codes".

Information was being passed amongst members of a ring in the USA
in the 1930s via a laundry service, based on the number of shirts
sent in each day.

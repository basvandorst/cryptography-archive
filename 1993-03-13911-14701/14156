How did you get this?  Just the raw IC on the ciphertext is 0.0392,
which would indicate a period of around 22.  My guess is that you
looked at the average IC assuming N alphabets, and observed that N=8
gave the best IC.  It isn't a particularly strong candidate, but it's
the best one.  Or did you do something else?

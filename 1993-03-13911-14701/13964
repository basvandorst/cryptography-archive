   It seems the designers of Dolphin Encrypt have thought of most things
   like this.  The encryption/decryption commands I use in the batch file
   specify no target file name for output, so the file resulting from the
   operation has the same name as the input file.  What actually happens
   in this case (assuming we are encrypting), according to Page 4.2 of
   the documentation, is that "Dolphin Encrypt first writes the encrypted
   data to a temporary file.  If the encryption is successful then the
   program purges (that is, overwrites and deletes) the original file and
   renames the temporary file with the name of the original file."  Thus
   there is no plaintext left lying around on the disk for someone to
   recover, since it was overwritten.  The only data left on the disk
   after the batch file is finished is the ciphertext.

not strictly true.  it is often possible to recover the old data on a
disk when it has been overwritten.

if you use windows, you also have to worry about the contents of swap
files.

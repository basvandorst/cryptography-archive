I guess that rarity is in the eye of the beholder.  I seem to recall that
a team from Georgia established that an infinite number of Carmichael numbers
exist and that their density (for large n) goes to n^(2/7). I have no idea
what the density of non Carmichael psuedo-primes is. BTW (2/7) < (1/2) as
required by the Erdos bound.

What I am attempting to say is that I make a difference between rare and
sparse.

In theory, this is quite correct.  But in practice, given realistic
OCR reader resolution (cost of each customs station is a concern
for government agencies), *hand* alignment of the passport on the
reader platen by the customs officer, the well-known lack of dimensional
stability of paper over time, and the fact that this document may get
beat up over it's 5 year lifetime, I doubt that this type of
steganography (to use its proper name) would be practical.

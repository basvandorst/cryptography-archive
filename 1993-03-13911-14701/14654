Read the source :-)
Altough the mapping of DES is 64bit<->64bit, the result is likely not to
be in ascii format. (0xFF71962100AABBCC would be such an output) Note the
'00' which would break the /etc/passwd line for fgets().
So the 8 bytes are encoded in 6 bits per byte to produce ASCII characters
32 to 95 (or so). If you need the exact transformation mail me, I will
send crypt.c to you.

In your original message (which you wisely "forgot" to quote), you are
NOT specifying that you mean 512-bit moduli. I (and most others who
are using PGP) use 1024-bit moduli. I listed all the possibilities,
because otherwise you could accuse me of "mind-reading" - one of your
favorite arguments.

So what's the difference? In order to be able to factor 1024-bit
mnumbers, your "enterprise" must generate all possible 512-bit (or
less) primes. This is equivalent to factoring a number by brute force.
In fact, there -are- brute-force factoring algorithms (for relatively
small numbers only), which rely on huge collections of consecutive
prime numbers kept on a tape. This doesn't make the method different
from brute-force factoring - in order to be able to break -any- key,
you must generate -all- possible 512-bit prime numbers.

It's just a colorful description of your claim that cracking messages
this way becomes trivial.

OK, I'm off for the next week - have to attend the Hannover
exhibition. Enjoy the flame war and keep posting nonsense - as usual
this will have the result to make the whole net.world dislike you and
oppose to any of your beliefs, just because you have adopted them.
Hopefully, this will make PGP and widespread use of public key
encryption even more popular - regardless of any patents, export
restrictions, and others some such. Have a nice day.

Regards,
Vesselin

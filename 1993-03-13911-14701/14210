Summary: Minor update to RIPEM email encryption program

Version 1.0.5 of RIPEM, a free public key encryption program,
is now available.  

RIPEM 1.0.5 contains a few minor changes and bugfixes.  Most 
significant are changes to better support multiple key servers
and a fix to mail header processing.

Most users will not need to upgrade to 1.0.5, but developers
will want to resynchronize their source code.

As always, RIPEM is available via non-anonymous FTP from
ripem.msu.edu.  For instructions, use anonymous FTP to that
site and get the document GETTING_ACCESS.  Please follow the
instructions very carefully.

Changes between 1.0.4 and 1.0.5:

+++ Modified RSAREF's r_enhanc.c and rsaref.h to support Initialize,
Process, and End modes so that it is not necessary to store an entire
message in memory at once.  (Raymond Lau)

+++ Altered ripemmai.c and strutil.c to correspond to Ray Lau's 
RSAREF API changes above.  However, RIPEM (Unix and DOS) still 
requires the entire message to be in memory for processing.  

+++ Changed RIPEM's Finger implementation to explicitly use the 
"long form" (-l) to ensure that the .plan file will be obtained
from all server implementations.  (Greg Onufer)

+++ Refixed a bug in which an extra blank line got inserted at
the beginning of the body of the message when -h i was not in effect.
(Greg Onufer)

+++ Changed crackhed.c to allow a value to continue from the 
first line of a multi-line header to subsequent lines.  This 
affords greater adherance to PEM RFC's.  (Suggested by Ray Lau.)

+++ Changed ripemsoc.c to keep trying all key servers even when
one explicitly reports that it does not have a given key.  This
allows a situation in which not all key servers have the same database.
(Suggested by Bill Owens)

+++ Changed crekeydb.c (utility in server/) to properly exit if it can't
open the input file.  (Greg Onufer)

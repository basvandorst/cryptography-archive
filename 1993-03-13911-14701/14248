As I wrote in an earlier posting in this thread, there is a
commercial company (IBAS) in Norway that can do the stuff that
Forrest is talking about. There is nothing you can do from software
that will securely erase a disk. Everything that is ever written
on it can potentially be restored. 

IBAS claims to have developed a method for 100% secure erasure,
involving the use of demagnetization hardware of their own design.

I did, however, speak with a researcher in the military security
service community once, who insisted that melting the platters was
the only way to go. Now, we know that these people prefer to err on
the side of caution, but then again, maybe he knew something IBAS
doesn't.

What we know then, is that while physical destruction certainly
_will_ erase the information, software certainly _won't_. What
comes in between (i.e. special demagnetization procedures) the
experts appearently disagree on.

IBAS (a ~30 employee company) receives wiped, crashed, burned and
otherwise damaged disks from all over Europe, and they usually
manage to restore all the data. As far as I know IBAS is a
one-of-a-kind company in Europe. I don't know about the US though.

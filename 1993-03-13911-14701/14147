	This cuts both ways, of course. As your machine becomes able
to do crypto faster to protect itself, the other guy's machine becomes
able to do crypto to break yours faster. So, while it's easier to add
crypto to your system without noticing its performance impact, it's
also got less security than you'd like to think.

If we are talking about a small number of customers and images, then
rescanning each document for each customer would likely generate a
"unique" set of bits for each.  Simply shifting the source on the scanner
bed a bit would suffice (a convenient analog step in an otherwise
sterile digital process).

This results in something like a "document signature" (perhaps quickly
checked with a CRC) than a "customer ID".  But it achieves the desired 
goal: tracing.

This contrived example can be generalized in ways only limited by 
imagination.  If your information is a database indexed by key
files, then order the master records in a different way for each
customer.  More generally:  if your information is organized in a manner
which gives some flexibility in the storage of the information with no
net change in the information itself or access of it, then that normally 
mundane aspect of your data can be used to this advantage.

Addressing the original question a little more directly, there are 
several popular image compression methods (JPEG, etc), all of which 
likely rely on various decisions (thresholds, perhaps) when mashing
around the data.  Those may be places where an automated "customerizing"
process could be injected.  Compression isn't encryption, by exactly how
it is performed could allow for tracing of the released data. 

Keeping secret this "feature" of your data for sale may be helpful.
A sly customer may be able to mess up a document signature, perhaps
weakening positive identification to be a percentage affair.  I don't 
know - would a court (settling a suit) accept secrecy* of the method used 
to prove guilt, or would one lawsuit let the cat out of the bag? 
(* - in the form of non-disclosure outside the courtroom, exclusion of 
details from court records, etc.)

Sorry I don't have any answers with equations or algorithms.  But I 
percieve (most of the) participants here as welcoming new, creative 
views on things (and that's about all I've got, not being an "expert").

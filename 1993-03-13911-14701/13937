I have a question to the Mathematical Experts of Cryptography.
It is about quadratic residues.

Question:
  Does there exist an algorithm to decide whether an integer r is
  a quadratic residue for a given modulus m?
  Or, to be more specific, let a predicate QuadRes(r,m) be defined
  for any two positive natural numbers r and m (r<m) by:

    QuadRes(r,m) <=> exists x: (x^2) mod m = r
    
  The challenge is to find an algorithm for this predicate, in which
  the time to compute is less than 24 hours (on normal hardware) for
  numbers r and m up to 1000 bits wide (thus excluding brute force).
  I have found something relevant for prime, odd moduli. However, I
  would like to have the answer for any modulus m.

I would be much obliged if anyone could give me an answer, or point
in directions, as I am not native in this intricate field. Nevertheless,
I hope the challenge will be large enough to set clever minds to work...
Please react by e-mail to joosten@cs.utwente.nl
If I get worthwhile reactions, I promise to compose an interesting
compilation of all the material I got.

Absolutely.

The `No matter what' is not clear to me, which was why I posted. I am
wondering if there was a way to encrypt what was being sent back. Looking at
the code should only describe the algorithm used for encryption. The real
problem is getting some sort of key securely across.

Another poster mentioned simply using a public key. This is probably the
simplest solution.

As with any site. Actually, my motivation comes from reading too many
books about cyberspace. I seemed to me the using services accessed via a
global net is not very secure in terms of privacy. Secure encryption really
only works when you have someone you trust at the other end that you want to
send private messages to.

For example, when I go to the library, what books and magazines I look at is
really known only to me until I take them out of the library. Accessing an
electronic library from my home terminal means my browsing results are sent
through the net from the library to my home. This is the kind of thing I was
wondering about.

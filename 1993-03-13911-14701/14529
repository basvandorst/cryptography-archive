I have read a NIST publication (800-2 on public-key cryptography) which
specifies this scheme to be generally regarded as secure and practical
(with the use 100 digits primes of course:-).  

I am looking for an sample algorithm of this scheme without the use of
such large prime factors. If anyone can help me with this, or a n y  
other information of this scheme, it would be very much appreciated.

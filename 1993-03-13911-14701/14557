I think a bit more than that is necessary, because if something is known
about the polynomial (e.g. it has integer coefficients) then information
can be leaked.  For example, if P(x)=0  for N distinct values
x=a1,a2,..,aN, and P has integer coefficients, then we know that P(0)
is divisible by the product a1*a2*...*aN.  

Another thing to consider is that different coalitions of N players have
different amounts of information about the polynomial.  In the above
example, the people who know the extreme values have a bit more information
than  those who know the values in the middle of the range.  This
discrepancy seems to persist in the general case when P has rational
coefficients, when you consider the "height" (in the sense of divisibility)
of the coefficients of the interpolation formula for determining an N'th
polynomial from its values at  N+1 different points.

Maybe the way out would be to give the values of P at roots of unity.  
This would give each individual player the same amount of information,
although there still seem to be problems with coalitions.  Is there a
completely symmetrical method of distributing the information?

Doesn't this leave the smart card itself as a vulnerable item?  For
example, if I create a smart card for myself by duplicating your card's
data but substitute my signature metrics instead, can't I masquerade as
you?  In a central database, at least you have physical security over
the authorizing data.  [Perhaps I've been watching too many War_Games/
Sneakers/etc. movies :-]

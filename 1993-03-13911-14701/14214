The most robust kind of totalitarianism is tyranny of the majority,
aka democracy.  With tyranny by an individual or a ``ruling elite'',
at least the oppressor can be identified and will eventually be
toppled.  This infatuation with ``democracy'' that has become
ascendant in recent centuries bids fair to thrust humanity into a dark
ages from which it will never recover, rendering into insignificance
this wonderful experiment in intelligent life begotten by Sol.

The promise and hope of privacy through cryptography is not in the
direction of the _collective_ decision-making of democracy, but of
_personal_ choice.

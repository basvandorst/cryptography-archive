/The government might say - sure, use encryption all you want as long
/as you register with us and use it for limited purposes in limited
/amount (important business interests, for example), so when the crisis
/comes we have your address can come and visit you, and shoot a bullet
/thru your encryption equipment.  Better yet, they might give you black

Or, if things are tense enough, simply shoot that bullet through the
POSSESSOR of encryption equipment that is not obtained via a permit,
or which is not registered with the authorities, or approved by them.
A few such examples will tend to reduce the degree of non-compliance,
and not simply by attrition.   Anybody that thinks that government
types are not capable of this is rather naive.  It's only a matter
of how badly they want to control the thing in question (encryption
in this example, guns and religeous beliefs in the case of Waco, TX).

/ ...  I think the issue is
/plainly and simply a question of power - who can be trusted with
/power.  The government?  The citizen?  It's simply a matter of whether
/the government knows best or whether you know best.  The framers of
/U.S. Constitution didn't seem to trust the government very much, and I
/don't see any reason to disagree with them, especially at times like
/this.

It makes one really wonder what Denning's motives and alliances are.

As I understand it from the open literature, there have been programs around
for many years that can look at text and tell if it is, say, English.
Conceptually, it's trivial. Letter frequencies, dictionary lookup of words,
etc. all can be used.

Thus if one starts with a DES message and does a brute force search using
all possible keys, one can quickly eliminate all but those messages in
 "English". I am not an expert, but as I understand it, if the message is
long enough, only one key will produce an entire message in English. That
is: unless the key is about as long as the message (in which case, like the
monkeys at the British Museum, you will produce all possible messages),
one will recover the "right" message in this way. The chances of recovering
such a "right" message are much higher if one has many messages with the
same DES key. (This isn't the case with RSA/DES since each message uses
a different DES key.)

Finally, if one is using a simple substitution or transposition cipher,
the frequency counts won't be helpful, but word lookup for each "test"
decryption still will.

Note that the above is a "naive" view. Others more skilled in the arcana of
DES, s-boxes, etc. may want to modify, amend, or even contradict the above
account with respect to brute force attacks on DES.

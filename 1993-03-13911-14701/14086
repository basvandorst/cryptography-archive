I have read this story in several places.  Can someone check to see if it is
in "The Codebreakers"?  If it was there, it would at least be a version of
the story with references.  The versions I remember stated that Navaho was
used for real-time battlefield tactics, not coded messages.  In other words,
the Navaho were used to relay real-time information when there was no time to
code up a message (a big job in thes pre-computer era, recall).  The Native 
Americans would communicate by radio.  The stories I heard state that Navaho
was used in lieu of the other choices because it was related to "no other
language in the world".  I don't remember any of the sources going into any
more detail on why this "worked".

This embellishment seems unlikely.  Decoding a natural language that one had
access to no dictionary or syntax structure seems to me a formidable task.  For
instance, wasn't it true that no real progress was made on some ancient
languages until the Rosetta stone came along?  If Navaho was used only on the
radio, it would seem also to magnify the difficulties in a practical sense in
an era where recording was in its infancy. 

In cryptography terms, I call the Rosetta Stone a "crib".  Maybe
success is possible without it, but I would guess it would magnify the
difficulties.  But, would you know more of this than I?

On the other hand, it may be that even though the _language_ was unknown, the
subset used for military battlefield operations was small enough to be adequately
attacked.

In the versions of this story that I remember, I recall reading the claim that
Navaho was "not related to any language in the world", which seems a rather 
strong statement, even given my ignorance on this topic.

As for the claim that some Native American languages are not related to "any
language in the world", I heard this claim repeated on National Public Radio
as recently as yesterday.  It seems that either British Columbia or Washington
state (forget which) is considering passing
and funding a program to collect and preserve some Native American languages
and culture and mention was made of at least one tribe whose language was said
"not to be related to any other language in the world".  This is a claim I've
heard and never quite understood.  While we're discussing this, maybe Mr.
Jorgensen can translate this undoubtedly layman's simplification into something
those of us with a little crypto background can relate to.

I am not quite sure what a statement like that really means, but maybe as
a linguist, you can tell how a linguist would phrase it.  I do know that
Native American tribes developed a vast number of cultures and, with not much
writing, I assume the languages could drift apart much faster than elsewhere.

Still, it seems widely agreed that Native Americans migrated from Asia and,
I would presume, had something like a unified language source, even if there
were many migrations over a long time?

If so, surely there would remain common roots in Native Languages; at least most
of them could have common roots?  Or, have they diffused so much and for so long
that linguists have given up on drawing a completely connected language "family 
tree"?

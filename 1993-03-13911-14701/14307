According to comments made by a NIST representative at Interop, the
recertification review has not yet been completed.  However, the
comments received were almost unanimously in favor of recertification,
and that is the likely outcome.  A number of respondents suggested
changes in the modes of operation (i.e., endorsing multiple encryption,
especially when shipping around keys), or to permit software implemen-
tations as well as hardware.

I'm not trying to hit a panic button here.  I'm simply pointing out what
seems like a weak link.  I'm sure there are a number of ways that PGP could
be weakened or otherwise "damaged".  For example, a recent independent
thread ("Cracking RSA?") has been discussing some nuances of the primes
selected for public keys (ref: <1993Mar29.181604.23040@linus.mitre.org>).
It was news to me that my 256-bit PK primes should be more that 10^15
apart or else my public/private key pair can be "easily" broken.  Are
yours?

Others have posted here before suggesting that sources be signed or
checksumed, etc.  I like that idea.  If and when I need to apply a patch
or build a version for a currently unsupported configuration, I'd like
some strong assurance that I'm using the Real Thing (tm).

I don't contend your assertion that there are well run, acceptably secure
BBSs out there.  I should be cautious consumer.  Many people, however,
are not so enlightened.  In my involvement with the net, reading this
group and comp.risks (among others) I have learned that the assumption
of safety and security can be a mistake.  Viruses and hackers exists and
persist. 

One worst-case scenareio might include a tainted version of PGP being
distributed, and the fallout from "bad press" damaging the entire
goal here.  Grass-roots methods for putting the power in the peoples'
hands might no longer be trusted or seen as viable.

I need to say that generally I *like* the idea of further distribution,
ideally including BBSs.  I think that people here are quite capable of
coming up with ways to ensure that PGP distributions can be made
securely.  I specifically encourage further discussion on areas which
could be strengthened.

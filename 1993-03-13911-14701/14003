I think the idea here is to come up with a way to encode something into the
picture (or extract information from the picture) so that it is a permanent
part of the picture.  If successful, then even a screen snapshot will still
contain the information and thus be identifiable.  Neat trick, if you can do
it.

I'm not sure if the original poster wanted to distribute multiple unique
copies, or just be able to identify the picture he released.  If it's the
latter, you want to develop something that extracts the "essence" of the
picture, a little like MD5 but less exact, so that even if the picture were
processed, quantized, JPEG'd, or whatever, it would yield the same "key".
If a jury (or any human) looked at two pictures side by side, they could
easily determine if they were from the same photograph.  It would nice to
have a mechanized way of doing this.

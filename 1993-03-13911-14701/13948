Look up the law of quadratic reciprocity in any elementary number
theory book. In what follows I will assume you have done so.

Let us assume a and b are odd integers and (a,b) = 1.
Let (a/b) be the Legendre symbol. (i.e. (a/b) = 1 if a is a quad. res. of b and
-1 otherwise)
 
Then if a and b are both 3 mod 4 we have (a/b) = -(b/a), else we
have (a/b) = (b/a).  So (a/b) can be evaluated using nothing more
than the Euclidean algorithm.
 
A simple example:  is   17 a quadratic residue of 105?
We have:

(17/105) = (105/17) = (3/17) = (17/3) = (2/3) = -1, so the answer is no.

If a and b are multi-precise integers and one uses classical arithmetic
algorithms for multi-precise arithmetic, the algorithm runs in time

O(1 + log(max(a,b)/gcd(a,b))) log(min(a,b)))

Thus it is basically about log(min(a,b)).

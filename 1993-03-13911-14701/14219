I'm afraid you're wrong. It's not the CRT itself that makes it
possible to do the pickup. Rather, it's the serial nature of the
data that's fed to the CRT. The pickup could work fine even with
the monitor disconnected. Using flat-panel displays won't change
this, as the data is still serial.

It would be a big improvement if we could have flat-panel
displays that were somehow integrated with the display memory.
This way there would be no need for serial display data, and
the possibilities of doing a pickup should be substantially
lowered.

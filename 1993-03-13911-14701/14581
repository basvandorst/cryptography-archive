In article <1993Mar26.194555.22173@husc3.harvard.edu> Tal Kubo calls me
an ``idiot'' because (1) Tal says he doesn't remember Bob claiming to be
the world's leading expert on factorization; (2) Tal says he doesn't
remember Bob claiming to be the world's leading expert on the quadratic
sieve; (3) Tal doesn't remember Bob's outright claims to have factored
more numbers with NFS than anyone else (Tal does quote Bob's most recent
article, in which Bob qualifies this claim, as if this were supposed to
negate all that had come before); (4) Tal says he doesn't remember Bob
repeatedly labelling other people's work as irrelevant; (5) Tal doesn't
remember the many wild exaggerations in Bob's articles which have been
pointed out. (My favorite was Bob's claim that he knew how long
factorization and discrete logs took ``in the 300 to 600 bit range.''
How? By ``direct measurement.'')

Ah, the glory of the net. Tal remembers nothing and calls me an idiot.

Tal, you can let Bob defend himself. Do you really think that he would
stay silent if he saw a mistake in my summary of his public claims?

You most certainly DO.  If we were talking about a "text" message,
in order for YOU to read the message, it has got to get put into
plaintext form on your screen, if nowhere else.  (Unless you're into
doing the decoding in your head.)

In the case of a picture, the "mandatory" plaintext would probably
represent a dump of the memory that contains the image being
displayed.

Any method that doesn't require that the picture exist in some sort of
"raw/plaintext" form would involve some rather special relationship
between software and hardware.

If a picture gets onto MY screen, then it is possible to run a program
that grabs a copy of the video memory, and dump it to disk.  (Further
processing may be required in order to get the picture into a
convenient form for processing with standard graphics tools; the form
is still "plaintext" as far as the computer is concerned.)  

To prevent this would require some form of "hardware" copy-protection,
and could probably STILL be gotten around by using hardware to read
the signals going to the monitor.

But if I grab the bitmap that contains a signature SOMEWHERE, and
change some bits, thereby obscuring, overwriting, or otherwise
removing the "signature," how can it then be proven that the picture
WAS in fact signed?

"Doing it on a secure computer" is fine, but makes the whole signature
process irrelevant.  The issue is, can the picture be signed in such a
way that the signature CANNOT be removed.  If you can't actually
manipulate the picture in ANY way, then the signature is irrelevant.

It may be fairly easy to prove that the picture represents something
published previously, but that's not the point.  The desired result is
that the signature cannot be removed.  It certainly LOOKS like the
signature could be removed.

In a civil case, you'd have to give a preponderance of evidence that
the picture DOES contain the signature.  And if the signature is
sufficiently obscured, that preponderance of evidence won't be there.

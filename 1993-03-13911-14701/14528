In other words, some innocent behavior (eg., going 2 MPH over the speed
limit or encrypting with an unregistered key) is given a *huge* penalty
(?death?) just so that the gov't has a loaded and cocked gun at the head of
anyone it wants to find criminal but can't prove anything against.

The loaded gun ends up at each of our heads.

The gov't says: "don't worry.  you're a good guy.  we will use this gun
only against the bad guys."

Then, along comes someone even worse than Nixon -- and we're all screwed.
That gov't could decide that anyone who fails to be openly and immediately
obedient and respectful of Authority (remember Nixon's Wagnerian
entrances?) is a bad guy.  [See Shirer's "Berlin Diary" or "Nightmare
Years".  Circa 1934, people who failed to salute the Nazi flag as a band of
(SA?) (SS?)  marched by would be beaten up -- for failing to respect
Authority.]  Well, FBI, keep this in your database.  That's me.  You don't
need to gather evidence of my lack of respect for granted authority.  I
respect people who earn my respect.  The FBI isn't on that list, right now,
thanks to their desire to tap my PBX and to Prof Denning and her suggestion
that they would like to limit crypto.  If the FBI would care to vehemently
refute her suggestion and renounce any suggestion of wanting to wiretap my
LAN or PBX (declaring it to have been an errant departure from justice (one
of many) which was corrected when the Bush administration was ousted), then
maybe I'd get some respect for the FBI back.

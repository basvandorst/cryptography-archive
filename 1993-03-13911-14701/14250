I think this message to be inaccurate and misleading. Denning published a
paper suggesting key registration as a compromise between the government's
need for reading the traffic of suspects, and the needs of the innocent for
privacy and legitimate business for security. She made her proposal as an
academic. To my knowledge the government has not advanced any such proposal.

Denning did not ignite a flame war here. Others, commenting on her paper,
did. Though she sent an occasional message in the discussion she did not, by
and large, participate. No intellectually dishonesty was involved, and the
suggestion raises concern about Glendenning's willingness to shoot from the
hip.

After lurking here for a while and picking up a lot about various topics in
crpytology, I've decided to roll up my sleeves, and actually learn more about
cryptology myself.  My approach is to write programs to encode and decode
using a given method, then to write a program to break or assist in breaking
the original code.  After a couple of hours of reading and programming, I
had programs to make and break Caesar type code (no snickers, please), and
now I am working on Vigenere codes.  

What is what to know is how important are alphabet sizes?  For generality, I
am using and alphabet size of 256.  I wrote a little program to generate
frequency tables from a given type of input (text, executables, etc.) so that
isn't a problem.  What is a problem is the references I am using assume 26
letter alphabets.  Translating to 256 letters isn't a problem either, but I
am winding up with mostly empty alphabets, and I am concern that when I 
compute things like indices of coincidence, I am not getting valid results.

Any insights to this, my learning approach, or any general advise would be
appreciated.  E-mail might be a good idea, as this problably is not of
widespread interest.

They failed, of course.  Seems as though that motorcade through downtown Dallas
trick only works once.

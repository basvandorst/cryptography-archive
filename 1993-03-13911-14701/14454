It seems to me that if this is a relatively new approach in the unclassified
literature, those who have been well-funded and working in less open areas
with very large machines and the ability to build special purpose devices
may well have come across and used it some time ago. I don't have any inside
information--just speculating.

Does this mean my faith in the resistance of RSA to attack should be more
shaken than some other messages here suggest?

As to Bernstein, I notice he mentions 512-bit RSA moduli. What does he think
about the strength of RSA with 1024-bit moduli? Is it time that programs
such as Ripem and PGP provide 2048-bit moduli? Would that add too much time
to the (IDEA/DES) key encryption? Would RSA key pair generation time
increase linearly, or worse?

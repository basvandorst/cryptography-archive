In my "Final Thoughts", I said that the events that Marc and the 
other CACM commentators of my article referred to did not occur under
the current wiretap statutes, which date back to the 1968 wiretap law 
and the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).  This should 
be read as "under both laws", not as "under the earliest law".  FISA 
is particularly relevant here since it covers the national security-related 
cases, whereas the 68 law covers the criminal cases.  The taps on King 
and the dissident groups mentioned by Marc were national security related.

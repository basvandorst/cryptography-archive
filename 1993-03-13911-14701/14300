On the inside back cover of a US passport there is a barcode and
a series of digits.

When you go through US immigration they scan this, examine the
information and decide to let you through or to detain you.

Questions:
	
(i)	What does this code mean (it's not my ss# or my passport#)?
(ii)    Is it read-only or can it be updated on the spot?
(iii)   Is a simple authenticity test?
(iv)    Does anyone know ANYTHING about this bar code???

Thanks..

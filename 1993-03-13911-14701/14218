I was slightly involved in some experiments with these things
a few years ago. Using simple equipment we were able to read
monochrome monitors with no problems at all. Color monitors
with colored text/background were a lot worse.

A determined opponent could try to exploit phase differences
between the colors to separate them. Also, the use of image
processing harware would be a plus.

Your solution would raise the cost of the pickup equipment,
but probably wouldn't make it impossible to do.

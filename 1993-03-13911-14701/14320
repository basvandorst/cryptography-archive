The current Cryptologia (Jan 93) has a book review by Louis Kruh of

	Winds of Freedom:  The Story of the Navajo Code Talkers of World
        War II.  Two Bytes Publishing Co., 219 Long Neck Point Road,
        Darien CT 06820 USA. 1992. 185pp. $21.92 (sic), hardcover; $16.95,
        soft cover.

The review says American Indian languages were first tried for radio
communications in WW1.  Some examples of terms they added to their
vocabulary for WW2 were chicken hawk for dive bomber, many big guns for
artillery, and sea soldier for navy.  Their dictionary has been
declassified and is included in an appendix.  Kruh recommends the book
highly, and says "Bixler presents the most complete story to date of the
Navajo Code Talkers."

Ok... I'm a newbie to this, so t-a-l-k s-l-o-w-l-y....

I have a need for some kind of identification / authentication.... here's
the scenario....

We develop a CAD program which allows modules to be dynamically loaded
at run time.  I want to restrict this mechanism such that only
certain modules can be loaded.  Here's what I thought I'd do....

Vendor would develop his module as normal.  Then he would run a certain
program on it, which would compute some value (I'm thinking CRC, MD5, 
or something of that nature).

He then calls us, tells me what that value is, and I run some "magic
function" on that value, and give him the result.  He imbeds the value/result
pair in his module.

When we go to load modules, we read in the module, and recompute the value,
and the result, and if they don't match, refuse to load it.


Questions:

1) is this secure (i assume it is, given good functions for computing
   value/result, since this seems to be how most license managers work).

2) what functions should I use for value / result

3) how many bits should value / result be.



thanks,

Note that a pass-phrase derived key is not the same as a true-random
key for a symmetric cipher (e.g. DES or IDEA). In particular, with
a known plaintext attack, the fact that the key is known to be derived
from a (human-generated) pass-phrase can significantly reduce the
space that needs to be searched. In practice, this usually reduces to
near-triviality, given the average human's idea of what an "unguessable"
password/phrase is.

In the hands of an expert user, it will work well of course. But then,
an expert user won't have the slightest difficulty using a true-random
DES or IDEA key directly.

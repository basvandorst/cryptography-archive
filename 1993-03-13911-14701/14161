No, not rather easily, but it's not impossible, either.  As Greg Rose
said, it's certainly not equivalent to a one-time pad.  The attack he
suggested would work fine for plenty of text, for a cipher-text only
solution.  However, it's also quite susceptible to a known-plaintext
attack.  A suitably long chunk of known plaintext would probably be
sufficient to recover both keys.  For example, if Charlie were to post the
first (say) 15 characters, that would probably suffice to expose the rest
of the text... not a cool feature for a cipher system.

If the survival of my country or even some cash depended on it, I'd try
crib-dragging to provide my own known plaintext... probably not worth it
for a casual challenge, though, since it'd be quite a bit of extra hacking.

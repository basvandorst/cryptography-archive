Actually, Bob, we used the related non-monic polynomial 8x^5 - 1.
Monic polynomials lead to needlessly slow factorizations, especially
for general numbers.

What do you mean by ``yield'', Bob? One would have to be singularly
shortsighted to use such big coefficients. Surely you can find 23-digit
coefficients in your sleep even with no experience in searching for
polynomials.

Gee, Bob, is it too much to ask that you leave assertions about the
power of the number field sieve to those working in the area?

Have you ever factored a difficult 384-bit number, Bob? Maybe, just
maybe, you should label your guesses as what they are.

One more flog on this dead horse.  There's a more direct way to recover
the keywords given the crib for that double Vigenere -- just using algebra
on the plaintext and ciphertext and skipping the step that assumed one or
both keys was in /usr/dict/words.  To review the bidding, the cribbed
plaintext is DELIGHTFULHUMANBEING and the corresponding ciphertext is
	     DOSAODNJWJTEAVOHAKPF.
The key is   AKHZIWUECYMKOVBGWCCZ, which is the combination of the two
overlapping keys of different length, applied using standard Vigenere.

Now assume the keys are of length 9 and 13 (since we know from solving it
that they are; you need to do this for each potential pair of lengths).
Calling the 9-character key a0..a8 and the 13-char key b0..b12, we get a
bunch of equations, based on the fact that we know that they add up to
the observed double key:

  A = a0 + b0      W = a5 + b5      M = a1 + b10      G = a6 + b2
  K = a1 + b1      U = a6 + b6      K = a2 + b11      W = a7 + b3
  H = a2 + b2      E = a7 + b7      O = a3 + b12      C = a8 + b4
  Z = a3 + b3      C = a8 + b8      V = a4 + b0       C = a0 + b5
  I = a4 + b4      Y = a0 + b9      B = a5 + b1       Z = a1 + b6

for a total of 20 equations and 22 unknowns -- meaning that with two more
characters of crib we could solve this unambiguously.  However, this is
plenty to get started with.  Look at all 26 possible values for a0, and
see what we can deduce.  Using mod 26 arithmetic for everything, we have:

	   b0 = A - a0     b9 = Y - a0     b5 = C - a0

Continuing, we can recover all but a3, b3, a7, b7, and b12 -- just by
picking a0.  Putting dots for the five unknown letters, we get:

ADZ.VUY.P AHI.NCW.NYJL.  JMI.EDH.Y RYZ.ETN.EPAC.   SVR.NMQ.H IPQ.VKE.VGRT.

ILH.DCG.X SZA.FUO.FQBD.  RUQ.MLP.G JQR.WLF.WHSU.

The one starting UXT is the only one with a likely pair of keys.

So -- one could go through this stuff with each pair of key lengths: 7-11,
7-12, 7-13, 8-11, and so on... and it's still short enough to be feasible
with pencil and paper without resorting to brute force.

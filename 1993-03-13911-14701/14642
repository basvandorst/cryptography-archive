You don't seem to understand. The point is that if, say, Lotus wanted
to be able to export Notes unrestricted, they could simply register
the whole of the sources and deposit them with the copyright office
and suddenly it should be exportable. No one was arguing copyright
means automatically exportable -- the point was merely that it could
be used as a way to have your cake and eat it too -- that is, a way to
avoid publishing something and yet have it be "Public Domain" for
purposes of the ITARs.

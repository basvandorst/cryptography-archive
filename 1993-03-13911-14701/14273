The advantage of signature verification is that your hand will
probably not be able to produce the right signature after it has
been cut off :-)

Devices for fingerprint recognition should better be equipped to
distinguish between a real live thumb, a cut-off one, and a cast of
a fingerprint.  Otherwise, it could get really scary.

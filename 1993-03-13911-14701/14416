I suggest you check this. A few years ago the U.S. revised its copyright
laws to bring them into consistency with the  Berne convention, to which the
U.K. is a signatory. There is now no requirement to deposit copyright works,
nor can a copy be compelled (except, of course as evidence in a lawsuit
under discovery rules).

The only reason to deposit them now (at least in the U.S.) is to create
additional evidence of date of copyright in case someone plagiarizes.
I can see music composers, for example, finding this valuable, but
for many situations, where there's no dispute about authorship and the
issues are the use of another's work, a deposit isn't as necessary.

Let us know what you find out.

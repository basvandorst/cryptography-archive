All this is irrelevant anyway. The Copyright Office only requires registration
of "identifying materials" -- NOT the entire body of source code for a program.
Specifically, only the first and last 25 pages of "visually perceivable"
material is necessary. This could be an object code dump (if you don't distribute
source code) or simply some innocuous parts of your program (if you do)
-- who is to say what the "first" and "last" parts of any program are? They
need not be what is logically first and last, only physically in your organization.
(C programmers have a natural edge here, as the language naturally encourages
reams of trivia at the head of a source module. C++ is even better <grin>)

And, as others have noted, you need only register when you're ready to litigate.
Full protection accrues the instant you set fingers to keyboard as a software
author.

You know because you already have some knowledge of the plaintext.  In
the real world, it is impossible to keep all ciphertexts secret
forever.  For example, if a message is sent to several recipients,
each can obtain a plaintext/ciphertext pair for the others.

This is the way that most military codebreaking has been done; Kahn's
_The Codebreakers_ has lots of examples of this.

Any good encryption system has to be secure against an even stronger
attack: chosen plaintext.  This is when an attacker chooses the text
to be encrypted.  In a network where messages are passed over multiple
encrypted links this is impossible to prevent.

Hmm -- randomly-flipped bits will interrupt most compression algorithms;
you'll create improbable pixels in improbable places.  And when the
file was uncompressed, I think their effect would (or could) be magnified.
It would be a great hack to create an almost-perfect looking picture that,
when run through jpeg or the like, had a big diagonal ``THIEF!'' across
it...

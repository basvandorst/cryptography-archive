Today Japan owns the 7/11 store chain, Dunlop, Universal Pictures, Columbia
Pictures, Loews Theaters, MCA Home Entertainment, Tri-Star Pictures, CBS
Records, Columbia Records, Spencers stores, Ciniplex Odeon (a big part),
Firestone Tires and many many more very large US companies while Americans
are prevented from owning any important Japanese concerns.

To find out more about this (and get a more complete list of the above), read
(JAPANYES) "Does America Say Yes To Japan?";Louis Leclerc 1992,93 which is
available free on INTERNET. (most recent edition is v031993). This thoughtfully
written and important article has been circulating widely in many of America's
biggest corporations & universities like IBM & Harvard. When you read it (it
takes about 30 minutes), you'll see why.

The essay provides a frightening yet fascinating detailed, referenced overview
of the Japanese industrial machine at work and how Japan practices 'business
is war' strategies to target and take over strategic critical U.S. industries
like high technology, popular media and heavy industry as well as influence
the decisions of the US government in favor of Japan. It is a very moving
piece and is filled with many verifiable and disturbing examples.

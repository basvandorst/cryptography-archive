	Hello, i have a question concerning the DES library call emplemented
in unix and salts used as a parameter to permutate the algorythm.  In the 
/etc/passwd file [its the only DES ciphertext i can get my hands on] i've been
looking at the letter correspondence between my plaintext password and the 
ciphertext password.  However there is a size difference between the two.  i
know the two byte salt is added to the beginning of the encrypted text but 
that still leaves three characters too many, if DES is a one to one cipher 
[and i believe it is].  Am i wrong about the size of the salt perhaps?
	Any help you can give me would be greatly appreciated.

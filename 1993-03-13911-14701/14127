The important bit I meant was *internet address*.  Many people in Fidonet
(for example) had pgp keys - and they may well end up being part of a web of
trust - most Fidonetters, however, do not know how to use internet: let
alone know how to form their fido address as such.

I have a number of keys on my ring which do not have an internet conformant
address in the appropriate place - what would the key server be expected to
make of those?  I expect that it would assume the key false - what then of
any signatures with that key?

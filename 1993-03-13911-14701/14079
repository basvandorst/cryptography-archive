Recently there was discussion of the book Spycatcher, by Peter Wright.

The original hard-cover edition is out of print, and unavailable in any
bookstore that I tried.  OTOH, almost by accident, I discovered that it
is available as a Dell paperback.  The paperback version does not
have all the illustrations of the original Viking Penguin edition.

I found (and acquired) two copies in my local Barnes & Noble bookstore.
Check for Dell #20132-2, ISBN 0-440-20132-2  $5.99

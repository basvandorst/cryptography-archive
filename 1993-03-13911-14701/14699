No, but you are wrong about what the stuff in the encrypted password is.
crypt does not DES encrypt your password. rather it takes your password,
and uses the lowest 7 bits of each of the eight characters in your
password as the KEY. It then uses that key to encrypt 64 bits of zeros
25 times.
In order that the output be printable, it then expands those 64 bits
into 11 printable characters (plus the two salt characters).

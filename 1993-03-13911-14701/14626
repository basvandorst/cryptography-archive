The company I work for is considering using RSA's RC2 encryption algorithm in  
our product.  I've read the RSA marketing briefs that discuss RC2, but I would  
like to get some opinions from people not associated with RSA.


Is RC2 nearly twice as fast as DES in comparable environments?

Is RC2 encryption speed independent of key size, as RSA claims?

Is RC2, with 64 bit keys, more secure than DES?

Just how easy is it to crack cyphertext encrypted with RC2 and 40-bit keys?


Any other opinions concerning RC2 are welcome.

Thanks,

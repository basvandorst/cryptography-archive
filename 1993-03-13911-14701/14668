   In other words, some innocent behavior (eg., going 2 MPH over the speed
   limit or encrypting with an unregistered key) is given a *huge* penalty
   (?death?) just so that the gov't has a loaded and cocked gun at the head of
   anyone it wants to find criminal but can't prove anything against. [...]

   The gov't says: "don't worry.  you're a good guy.  we will use this gun
   only against the bad guys."

   Then, along comes someone even worse than Nixon -- and we're all screwed.

Isn't selective enforcement fun!  
It doesn't even take someone worse than Nixon - just someone with
a randomly different Enemies List, and maybe you're on it this time.
Or maybe some Darryl Gates clone gets to be FBI head, or just *your* town's
police chief, and your PBX has the new FBI Monitoring Jack on the side.
But it's ok, because people who are innocent aren't usually suspects.

So maybe you annoy a local cop by photographing him at a bad time,
and the Division of Communications Registration discovers they've
*lost* your crypto key registration so they've got to confiscate your computer
until you can prove you really *did* register it.
Almost as much fun as having the D.M.V. forget you paid a parking
ticket and ordering your license suspended.

Or you get shoulder-surfed at the airport, and not only does your
phone bill have 25 calls to Bolivia on it like mine, but they used an
unregistered crypto key and they bring you in for questioning because
you *may* be a drug-dealing terrorist.

|Look up the law of quadratic reciprocity in any elementary number
|theory book. In what follows I will assume you have done so.
|
|Let us assume a and b are odd integers and (a,b) = 1.
|Let (a/b) be the Legendre symbol. (i.e. (a/b) = 1 if a is a quad. res. of b and
|-1 otherwise)
| 
|Then if a and b are both 3 mod 4 we have (a/b) = -(b/a), else we
|have (a/b) = (b/a).  So (a/b) can be evaluated using nothing more
|than the Euclidean algorithm.
| 
|A simple example:  is   17 a quadratic residue of 105?
|We have:
|
|(17/105) = (105/17) = (3/17) = (17/3) = (2/3) = -1, so the answer is no.
|
|If a and b are multi-precise integers and one uses classical arithmetic
|algorithms for multi-precise arithmetic, the algorithm runs in time
|
|O(1 + log(max(a,b)/gcd(a,b))) log(min(a,b)))
|
|Thus it is basically about log(min(a,b)).

The Legendre symbol works only if the b in (a/b) is prime.  The
generalization, the Jacobi symbol, is multiplicative: J(a,b) =
\prod_{i} L(a,p_i) where b = \prod_i p_i, p_i primes.  Unfortunately,
this means that if b is the product of two primes p and q, and
L(a,p)=-1=L(a,q), then J(a,b)=1 and things don't work.

A concrete example is a=7, b=143=11*13.  J(7,143)=1, yet 7 is not a
quadratic residue.

The Goldwasser-Micali probabilistic encryption algorithm is based on
the problem of deciding quadratic residuosity.  See:

It's rather unusual to find Bob making a mistake like this....

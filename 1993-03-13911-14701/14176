It's an obvious enough problem that I think the authors have noticed
it.  If I remember correctly, there's a bunch of "salt" that
immediately precedes that plaintext, which should mess things up
enough, so long as there's some feedback in the encipherment
mechanism.

And while I think it is Ziv-Lempel compression, it's based on
Info-ZIP, the "free" version of ZIP.

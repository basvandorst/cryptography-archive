	She was reading it at the time of the trial balloon.  She
	even posted a spoof of Clinton's jobs program that made fun
	of (what she saw as) the paranoia about FBI monitoring.
	The date was around 13 Nov 92.

	I agree that intellectual dishonesty is a strong term for what
	we see.  Blind faith (on her part) in the goodness of government
	agencies is a better description in my view.  I think she means
	well but has been deceived by her close relationship to the
	agencies involved.  They form a part of her "in-group" so she
	has trouble acknowledging that these agencies are a danger
	to our freedom.

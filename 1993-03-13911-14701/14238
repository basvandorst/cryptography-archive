Norton Diskreet is an interesting start, but it has some drawbacks.
Chief among them is that the source code and even the file formats
are not available for public inspection. Norton might have been pressured
by the government to build in a back door (this is not paranoia, given
the FBI's attempt to influence Lotus to do the same to their products).
Or they simply might have made an honest implementation mistake that
compromises security. But without a public review of their code and/or
algorithms, we'll never know.

Another problem is that Diskreet sets up and manages a virtual disk drive
that appears as a hidden fixed-sized file in the regular MS-DOS file system.
This is hard to manage -- you have to preallocate space for the encrypted
system from your regular system, and you either let much of it go to
waste or keep running it out of space. I want an encrypted file system
with a more flexible space allocation scheme.

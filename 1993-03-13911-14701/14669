Well, doesn't the PGP 2.2 distribution archive (DOS executables anyway) have
the signature of the author in them?  Just don't accept an archive that doesn't
have his signature on it.  If you don't trust they key, then you most likely
don't trust the program all that well either.

I have PGP 2.2 available (DOS, OS/2 and MacIntosh versions, plus sourcecode),
and as many cryptography related files I've been able to find available on my
BBS.  It's a free access BBS, so anybody can call up and get them.  Since I
have access to internet at school, I try to have the latest version of PGP
online as soon as I possibly can. Phone number is 1-918-665-8823, and the
maximum speed is v.32bis/ZyXel 16.8K)

Has anyone written up any documentation such as this (besides the PGP docs)
showing reasons for using encryption, etc?

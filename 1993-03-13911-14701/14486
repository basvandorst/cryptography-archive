| By the way, is there a better OTP algorithm than the obvious one?

: (More simply:  The XOR of all three ciphertexts is the cleartext.)

I take it the answer is 'yes' :-)

Oh bugger.  That'll teach me, huh.

OK, how *do* you use a one-time-pad for exchange of email, without
having to send the OTP separately by a secure channel?

Thanks for being tactful when you took it to pieces guys!  I claim

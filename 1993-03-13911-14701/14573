You need to get thin, then. Go study the algorithms (there are more than
one) for testing primality. They all have accompanying mathematical proofs.
What you're saying is akin to somebody complaining "I just don't understand
how this cosine thing lets you measure the distance to the moon. I'd feel
much better if you ran a tape measure out there and made sure."

Running a few hundred thousand candidates through a test, as you propose,
is no proof of the validity of an algorithm. If you test n cases, the n+1
case could be the clinker. The only way to be sure empirically would be
to test n+1 cases, and you can see where that leads <grin>

I suspect you don't really understand the nature of mathematical proofs.
Such proofs deliver what empirical tests never can: a guaranteed truth.
I'm not criticizing you, just trying to apprise you of the source of your
frustration. If you get some foundation in mathematical proofs (a few hours
study at most), you'll be on the road obtaining confidence in prime generators.

  Incidentally, I've seen one algorithm for *producing* large primes that
doesn't require the iterative test method. You give it a seed and you get
a prime. Very nice.

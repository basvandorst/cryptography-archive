The above abstract contains so much special use of language as to 
qualify as a secret code.  If you are not a master, this paragraph
would have almost no meaning at all.  If you are a novice, it would
be misleading.  For example, you would likely conclude that the 
discussion was about the loss of quality of the image.

How very embarrassing it will be for the authors when they return to
this abstract a decade from now.

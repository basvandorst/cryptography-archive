You bring up some good points.  PGP 2.2, which should be coming out
anytime, has the ability to set a flag on your keyring to "disable"
that key.  It says that a key shouldn't be used, without revoking it.

I don't believe that the disable bit is propagated, but it means that
most functions will ignore that key, and hense it will no longer get
propagated.

Basically, the way a key-server sets that bit is by the maintainer
setting that bit manually.  The maintainer then needs to get proof
that the key no longer is usable.

I hope this answers some of your questions.  Follow-ups should go to
alt.security.pgp.

I'm attempting to design a board to do DES according to the FIPS 
PUB 46 spec, which requires that encryption/decryption be done in
hardware.  Rather than design my own chip, I was hoping to find a
commercially-available chip/chipset that could run in the 5 to 10
megabit range.  However the Motorola rep I spoke with today said
that their chip (mentioned here a few times) has been discontinued.

Does anyone know of sources/part numbers for DES chips in the USA?

Thanks!

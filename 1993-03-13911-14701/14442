It does. The suite of programs we (``we'' meaning Arjen Lenstra and I)
developed and used to factor 2^523 - 1 is a complete GNFS implementation.
As even Bob will admit, GNFS (the general number field sieve) is the
method of choice for factoring 512-bit RSA moduli. Our programs are
ready for this task. Even by Bob's most pessimistic estimate they'd be
done in under a year on 100 MasPars working side by side. And that's
_without_ any tricks. Of course, until we have more data on GNFS speed,
nobody (not even Bob!) can reliably estimate how long they'd actually
take. The number field sieve is very new, so you should take all reports
on it as _progress reports_.

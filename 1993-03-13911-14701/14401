One simple countermeasure that occurred to me some time ago is to spread the
first local oscillator and then immediately despread it after the first
mixer. This wouldn't stop the first LO from radiating, but it would spread
out its energy and make it much harder to detect. It might well be cheaper
and simpler than extensive shielding.

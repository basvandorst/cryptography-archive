Anything I can display I can take a screen snapshot of...  and this
means that your program will have to support all video standards on
all computers that you want to sell images to for maximum use.

I was thinking perhaps of changing, say, 10 or so pixels in the
picture to colors that are very close to the original colors but not
exactly.  Compare it to the original and you have a unique signature.

Of course, any lossy compression scheme will nail this, as might
converting it to another resolution.   But if someone doesn't know
that it's being done, and distributes the picture without such
mangling, it's better than nothing.

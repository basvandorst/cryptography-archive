A slight correction. As I said above, one tests the numbers that survive
the sieve for primality. I didn't say one tests the numbers that survive
to see if they were probable primes. One would generally run Cohen-Lenstra
on the survivors.

:But there are ways to generate provable! primes, (in facter faster
:than testing the numbers that passed the sieve multiple times for
:primality)
 
To which method do you refer here? Cohen-Lenstra, which is currently
the fasted rigorous method (according to work of Wieb Bosma) will still
take a little longer than several trials of Miller-Rabin for 256-bit
numbers. 

:i know of at least one paper, describing such a method in detail,
:delivering provable primes which satisfy additional conditions RSA
:keys impose on them to hinder factorization of the product of two
:such primes.
 
I would be glad to hear about this paper if you have the reference.

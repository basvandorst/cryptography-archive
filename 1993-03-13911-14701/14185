Calling my bluff, eh?  Yes, that's enough information.  The keywords
are JUXTAPOSE and PROGNOSTICATE, and the exposed plaintext is:

 STANISLAWULAMAUNIQUELYINVENTIVEMATHEMATICIANANDAWARMANDDELIGHTFULHUMANBEING

From my plugging around with trying to hack it without a crib, I had lying
around a file of all single Vigenere decryptions with a single key, using
/usr/dict/words for the keywords, since you said both keys were common
words.  I then matched the end of each of those decryptions with the known
plaintext at the end of the cipher to determine what key would produce the
assumed single decryption, and for each of these printed out every key for
which the resulting assumed second key had the first three characters
repeated someplace in it, in hopes that the second key is shorter than the
crib and will thus show repeats.  The resulting winners:

		ADVERT XPDBPWRJYHTKLAXPDCZE
		CARTRIDGE ATOBATOAAYVRXNYASACI
		FUGAL VQBSXRAYCNHQIVQBCWCO
		HOPPLE MVSHEPGPNNIDAGMVSVOK

		SCUFFLE WSFYDRJAKWSFJKXOUIXU
		THUMB HDNGHDNKQXTDUJANPIQY
		TOPPLE MVSHEDGPNNIRAGMVSJOK

Note that the order of applying the keys is immaterial.  This is probably
a good time to put in my plug for Perl, the amateur cryptanalyst's best
friend.

Answering the rest of your questions in one fell swoop, adding more linear
bits to the Vigenere isn't going to make it much more secure.  Better to
break out one of the many fine public domain DES implementations, if you're
really interested in privacy.

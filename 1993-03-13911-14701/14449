I think there is also a book called "No Such Agency" which is older...
I haven't seen it, I've only heard it referred to.  Other than that
you're not likely to get much information on the NSA... their existence
and mission ceased to be a secret in the late sixties, but everything
else about them, including their budget which is reputed to be many times
that of the CIA, is classified.

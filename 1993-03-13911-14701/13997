Well, pgp -m can't really  stop one from saving plaintext.  At  least in UNIX,
this can be done  simply by running "script"  before pgp and removing  control
character from typescript.  I would imagine, the same would  be possible under
DV  in  DOS.   If  nothing  else, you  can always  recompile/reverse  engeneer
offending viewer and get it to save a picture anyway. Changes are likely to be
very small.

There's a reference for Americans using Native American languages as
"codes" in Kahn's "Codebreakers", page 549. (I found it by looking in
the index under "Navaho"). I'll paraphrase a bit here:

During World War I, a few Choctaws were used to transmit orders over
field telephone.

During World War II, Kahn says that the Americans used Navaho. "The
number of Navaho codetalkers in the Marines rose from 30 at the start
of the war to 420 at the end. They relayed operational orders with a
secrecy that helped the United States advance from the Solomons to
Okinawa."

There is a bit of speculation as to why Navaho was used. "Reportedly
only 28 non-Navahos - mainly anthropologists and missionaries - could
speak the language, and none of these were German or Japanese." Kahn
also remarks that a lot of Navaho speakers were available, and then
makes a suspicious argument about the intrinsic difficulty and
subtlety of Navaho.

There are a few references listed - mostly articles in popular media.

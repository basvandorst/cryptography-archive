Thanks to Philip Zimmermann for addressing a question that had indeed
crossed my mind lately.

I have another (not necessarily aimed at you, prz).  I don't quite
understand how the contents of the file RANDSEED.BIN are used.  I've
read the bit in DOC2 where it discusses how the "conventional encryption
algorithm" (IDEA, I assume) is used to "reseed" this file with new
random data, using the time of day, new key material (?), and other
"truly random sources".  This was somewhat helpful and reassuring, but I
still don't get it. 

The logic of trusting IDEA to create random numbers that I can trust
makes sense to me.  But I am further curious about the details of how 
RANDSEED.BIN is "laundered", and why leaving it on the disk for anyone
to snoop is not a risk.

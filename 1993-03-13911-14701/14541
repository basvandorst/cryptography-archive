:I am looking for a way to have N people share a secret (such as a key) in
:such a way that any predefined subset of those N people could get together
:and produce the key shared among the entire group.  For example, 8 people
:have pieces and 5 are needed to build the entire key, but it can be any 5
:of the 8.  I thought I had seen a reference to something like this in this
:group a while back but I apparently didn't save it.

:If it is possible and/or people know any references for me I would
:appreciate hearing about them...

Look up 'n of m error-correcting codes'.  Let's take a simplified example:
you have a four-bit key and four people to share it; any three can get
together and use the whole key, but fewer than three can't.  In this case
you could use a 1-bit-correcting hamming code, and give each of the 
participants a quarter of the key each (probably 2 bits from an 8-bit ecc'd
key)

For your purposes, just scale up the error-correction as necessary.  These
codes are documented in several textbooks, often more engineering-biased
than comp sci ones.

The term "secret key" leads me to think that you're talking about
public key crypto. Well, I thought you could use a symmetric cipher
(IDEA for instance), where the pass phrase would be hashed into the
IDEA key.

Yes, I assumed that the entire disk would be encrypted, including
the OS.

Well, you don't need physical security for the boot floppy, only
integrity.

How about having a program on the encrypted disk certify that the
floppy hasn't been tampered with? But at that point it would be a
little too late, of course, so what about partitioning the drive
into two volumes; one big "normal volume" and one small "floppy
integrity check" volume?

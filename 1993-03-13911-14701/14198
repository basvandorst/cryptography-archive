Some companies sell Tempest PCs (Trend comes to mind). If
you have an ordinary PC, it's probably hard to do any kind
of DIY shielding.

In general, it's all too easy and doesn't require a lot of
expensive resources. The BBC did a couple of popular science
programs about this some years ago. I seem to recall vaguely
that they had a van driving around in London, picking up
images from CRTs inside buildings.

If you're interested, I could have a look through the tapes
again and see if I can find anything resembling facts.

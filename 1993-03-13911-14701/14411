What is an RSA number?  (To me, every product of exactly two primes is
an RSA number.  I don't see why the number in the article could not
have been an RSA number.  Do you mean numbers that are the product of
two primes, p and q, where p - 1 and q - 1 do not have lots of small
factors?)

Sorry.  I really didn't know what you and several others have by now
pointed out to me.  I assumed several wrong things when I read that
article in the first place.  For example, since it appeared on sci.-
crypt, I assumed that it had an impact on cryptography, and since it
talked about factorization, I thought it was a fairly general problem,
and since it said ``record factorization,'' I assumed it was some kind
of breakthrough.  The article itself didn't mention the impacts, or
rather the lack thereof, of this particular factorization on general
integer factorization.  (That is of course not the author's fault.)
Additionally, ``Number Field Sieve'' and ``Quadratic Sieve'' sure
sound alike to an uninitiated.  My error.

You have a point.  In the future, I'll keep my big mouth shut about
this.  (I don't want to embarrass people more than necessary. :-)

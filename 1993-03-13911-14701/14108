someone asked a question something like this:

with the talks of federal agencies raiding politically incorrect organizations
and seizing hard drives, I was wondering if anyone was considering writing
a 'stacker' like utility for encrypting your entire drive?

	The operation might be in the form of individual sensitive files
and decrypting at run time. This would make the disk "seizure-proof". Maybe
pgp would not be the "ideal" method, but it might be done...? Any gurus wanna
give it a quick try? Not too sure how that would work.

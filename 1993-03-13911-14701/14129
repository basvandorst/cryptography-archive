	This story is true.  The role of the Navajo code-talkers in
	the Pacific campaign is well-documented and many of them are still
	alive and willing to talk about it.  A recent book about them
	received a very good review in "Cryptologia."

	This is nonsense.  The Japanese did not have a clue about
	what was going on.  Navajo was specifically chosen because
	of the rareness of non-Navajo speakers and its abominable
	complexity.

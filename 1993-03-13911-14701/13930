Not really relevant, either to this thread or to sci.crypt, but there are
rumors that the IRS will require preparers to file (1) electronically, (2)
on scannable paper returns, or (3) writing numbers on (exact copies) of IRS
forms.  Laser generated forms would be outlawed.  (With electronic filing
current requiring non-standard modems, or a leased line, _I_, as a tax
preparer, am not currently planning to do my own electronic filing,
although I have electronic filing and transmission IDs.)

As far as I know, my employer doesn't know I am a tax preparer.

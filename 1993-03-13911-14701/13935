   The only successful strategy I am familiar with is to make a living of
   hanging out in antiquarian bookstores and to be willing to shell out at
   least $100 when you happen to see one behind the counter, possibly more
   if you have to bribe the store owner to not give it to the person he's
   already saving it for.  Fortunately, this strategy has worked for at
   least three friends of mine, so I can take a breather on my own quest
   while perusing their copies.

   (Don't forget to check any large libraries in your area.  The CMU
   library has its own copy on a high shelf in the OVRSZ-Folio area.)

I saw these on the remainder table on the 2nd floor of Moe's
Books in Berkeley for around $20 a copy, but it was a while back.

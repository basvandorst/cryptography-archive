Whatever you do, DO NOT ASK THE CUSTOMS/IMMIGRATION PEOPLE ABOUT IT.
They get *very* annoyed with you.  I made the mistake of asking them
about it when I visited home last Christmas, and I was later taken 
aside and very thoroughly searched.  (Tip #27 for travellers looking
for excitement: carry several different currencies with you when going
into the States, and try to explain it!)  The friend waiting for me had 
a very confusing several-hour wait for me -- the airline said I had 
definitely been on the plane, but I never came out into the reception 
area.

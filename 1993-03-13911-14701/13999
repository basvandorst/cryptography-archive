Version 2.2 of Pretty Good Privacy, the world's most popular public-key
encryption software, will be released on Saturday, March 6.  It will be
available via anonymous FTP from ghost.dsi.unimi.edu, which is mirrored
by nic.funet.fi, and src.doc.ic.ac.uk.  It will then hopefully diffuse
out to the rest of the net.

French, Spanish and Italian translations will be released simultaneously;
German, Russian, Latvian, Swedish, Dutch and Esperanto will follow
over the next few days.

As well as the usual bug fixes and performance tuning, significant
improvements are multiple recipients in one file, better facilities
for running unattended or in shell scripts, and much faster keyring
management.

Macintosh and Amiga ports will follow.

For those wondering what PGP is, see the February issues of Scientific
American, Boardwatch, or Mondo 2000.  Or get the package and RTFM.

"PGP has allowed a lot of people to gain real experience with encrypted
communications.  I encourage people worldwide to use it to protect their own
files and communications, and to learn how to build social structures that
support widespread encryption.  (Encouragement void where prohibited by
patent law -- in the U.S.)."

First off, I don't/haven't read this group on a regular basis, so if the
following question is part of a FAQ, please let me know.

For a project at work, we need to encrypt a password and store it in our
code.  Then when a user enters a password, we need to encrypt that and
compare it to the previously stored one.

We never have to de-crypt anything.

Can anyone point me towards code that will do this with a fair level of
security and be fairly speedy?

Please e-mail responses as the newsfeed here is erratic.  I'll post a
summary of responses later.

Thank you,

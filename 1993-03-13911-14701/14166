I'm not sure that it's quite a one-time pad; it's not the TRUE key
length that's greater than the plaintext, just the LCM of sizes the
two keys, which IS a fairly different thing.

More knowledgeable people will probably tell us that a "double
Vigenere" is a little trickier to solve, but isn't ALL that nasty.

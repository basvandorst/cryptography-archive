Yes.

Simmons:Intro to shared Secret and/or Shared Control

He presents an approach based on geometrical bodys, and claims
that if (N-1) people share parts of the secret, they gain no 
information about the N'th part of the shared shecret, which 
would be needed to unlock.

Unluckily I do not have the paper at hand, and can not figure out
in my mind how exactly he defined things. Perhaps somebody could
quote ?

I may present an example for (2 out of N). Assume 3-dimensional space.
Given is a line (defined by two points). And a point of a plane.
Which would naturally need three points to be defined.
Control can be invoked, if one finds out where the plane has to intersect
with the line. Each member of the group knows one point lying in the plane,
and if two of them work together, they can calculate the plane, and inter-
sect it with the line. But one alone does not have any information about
the controlling point, as the plane could be turned around the line in nearly
every direction, and still match with the given line.

He presents more sophisticated structures (like needing  two peoples from
Group A, or 5 peoples from group B, or 1 from A and 2 of B two unlock),
but I can't remember them exactly.

Peter, I want to clarify to anyone reading why I declined to continue
cryptanalysis of your posted ciphertext challenge.

I have received 'historical references' from a long-standing contributor to
sci.crypt that suggest that all information as to your personal interests in
the encryption software that created the challenge ciphertext have not been
disclosed. Since I do not feel that the whole story is being told, I refuse
to assist in what I suspect is the marketing of a product.

I do not wish it to appear that "I couldn't crack it"; I simply refuse to
try. My decision to discontinue cryptanalysis should, in no way, indicate the
degree of challenge that the ciphertext presented  ( or sophistication of the
algorithm employed )  in my initial examination of it.

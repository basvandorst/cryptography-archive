Oleg Gordievsky, the former KGB operations chief in England who "defected"
in 1987, gave a lecture here last year about the KGB and how it operated.
After he spoke, I asked him about the KGB's success in cracking codes.  He
answered that throughout the 1980's, the KGB was reading the diplomatic
communications of 40-60 countries, but that among the NATO countries only a
few (sometimes none) could be decrypted at any given time.

This suggests that computers and mathematically sophisticated encryption
systems do help in foiling a powerful attacker, exactly as the theory
predicts.  Considering the much more extensive mathematical education in
the Soviet Union, the very large number of mathematicians trained in their
universities, and the role of the Soviet government in determining the
employment of these scientists, I doubt it would be long before any
(hypothetical) theoretical breakthrough at NSA could be duplicated at the
KGB.

Consider also that worldwide, the number of scientists working openly on
number theory and cryptography, is at least as large the number employed at
NSA; that the top graduates of mathematics PhD programs in the US tend to
remain in academia rather than work for the NSA; and that most major
discoveries in mathematics have been made by several different people at
more or less the same time. This makes a  unique breakthrough at NSA even
more unlikely, and leads me to guess that they weren't so far ahead of the
KGB that Gordievsky's information would not shed some indirect light on
their own capabilities. In some respects the KGB may have even been ahead--
the major advances in coding theory in the 1980's originated in the USSR
(Goppa codes & codes surpassing the Gilbert-Varshamov bound).

None of this rules out the possibility that the NSA could decrypt the
Russian traffic by other means, without breaking the ciphers in the
algorithmic sense.

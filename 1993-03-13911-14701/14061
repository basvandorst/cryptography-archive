Summary: Looking for references to cryptanalysis without human intervention

Hi,

I am an Honours student in Computer Science, wishing to tap the 
combined knowledge of the 'Net. I am looking for references
to stuff to do with automatic cryptanalysis of simple ciphers.

By 'automatic', I mean performed by a computer with little or no 
help from a human.

By 'simple ciphers', I mean the classical ciphers - Vigenere,
general monoalphabetic, compromised one-time pad, etc.

I am particularly interested in approaches using neural networks,
genetic algorithms, or simulated annealing, but would also
appreciate pointers to other work.

Thanks very much.  If anyone else is interested in this, I will
happily send them a summary of results.

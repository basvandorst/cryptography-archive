Give me a break. 512-bit primes are what pgp and Ripem use as a common
alternative, and you certainly know that. No need for a make-wrong nit-pick
here.

Not reading again, Vesselin? I wasn't talking about a factoring attack, but
a massive key generation enterprise.

Is "bullshit" a technical comment you derive from the best rational
arguments of mathematics and physics, or a novel logical step you've
invented yourself?

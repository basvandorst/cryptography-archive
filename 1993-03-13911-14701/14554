Oops. This didn't come out right. The sentence just above is a 
misstatement. If N has 2 prime factors then anytime QS yields
A^2 = B^2 mod N there is a 50% probability that A=B or A=-B
(and hence N fails to factor). If N is prime, this is 100%.
If one gets (say) 20 such failures in a row, one can't tell for
sure whether N is prime or whether you have simply hit the 1 time
in 2^20 that 20 trials will fail.

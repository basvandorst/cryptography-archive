Exactly. Note that I do not say that "Metzger attempts to teach us" but that
"Metzger's message" does. I compare that with his other messages, not with
him. That's fair comment, not ad hominem. Read again.

This is a distortion in aid of a make-wrong. I did not have a scheme, but
asked a question and received many serious and fine answers. I also received
a few nasty messages from those who seem to have a career here making others
who don't agree with them wrong.

Do I understand you to say that if you know the answer to a question that
another asks, the appropriate reponse is to ridicule the questioner rather
than answering it? There's a word for that kind of behavior, and I'm sure
you can supply it as well as I.

It's interesting to me that many who cannot deal with an issue at the level
of substance continue to resort to playground bullying techniques, such as
that of your above sentence. Judging from my mail, it's a source of wonder
to others as well.

In science one is hard pressed to use the word "impossible."  From a
practical perspective, as an engineer: impossible. <~>

Could I doctor up a phone to make something like this more feasible?
Yes.  Would I do it by modifying the ringer?  No.  If I can get in to
diddle the phone, there are lots better techniques.

A window pane makes an excellent diaphragm, and detecting the vibration
of that diaphragm isn't that tough.  (Bear in mind that the
window pane diaphragm also responds to vibration outside the room.
This means that you have to %%%%CENSORED%%%%)  The construction of a
conventional mechanical ringer is such that it's not a feasible
approach.

An electronic ringer offers a bit more potential, but in all the sets
that I've seen the driver circuitry makes the suggested scheme equally
improbable.

Before anyone goes nonlinear, the "censored" above was inserted by me,
in a moment of puckishness.  The discussion isn't really appropriate to
this newsgroup.  (Virtually none of this post is, for that matter...)

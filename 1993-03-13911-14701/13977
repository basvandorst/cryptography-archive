This zip code, which can also be found in the WordPerfect for Windows
5.2 program under the macro "envelope", is only defined for digits 0 to
9, as far as I can see.

Here in Canada, we use postal codes of the form "AnA nAn" where A=alpha,
and n=number.  Letters processed through the Canada Post system are
delivered with a "long-short" code similar to the one under discussion.

The bright sparks at Canada Post had no idea what I was talking about
when I asked for a copy of the bar code specification, which I need to
modify the WP "envelope" macro for use in Canada.  WordPerfect says
they had the same problem trying to get the info from Canada Post, and
are thus unable to provide a Canadian version.

Can anyone tell me how the Canadian Postal Code is coded within the
short-long bar scheme? i.e. how are alpha characters expressed using the
code.

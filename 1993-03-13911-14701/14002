This reminds me of a scheme I came up with to protect software.  I figured
that if you can't "protect" software, at least you could identify the person
who gave away your program by giving everyone a unique and identifyable copy.

The 68000 has quite a number of instruction "pairs", which are two different
opcodes that perform the exact same function.  Same number of clocks, same
number of bytes, same operation.  By taking your original code and, using
your "identification key", changing one opcode to its mate, you end up with a
unique version of the code without changing its functioning.  With just 20
occurances of this, you'd have a million unique versions.  So when you see a
pirate copy of your software on a BBS, you check to see who you sold that
version to and sue his ass off.  Small consolation once the damage is done,
but perhaps it would serve as a deterrent.

I'm not sure how this relates to the original task of protecting pictures,
but I'll be thinking about it.

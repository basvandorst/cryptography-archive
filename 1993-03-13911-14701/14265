	    Actually, for something like general purpose filesystem access,
    it seems crazy to make your general purpose CPU do all the encryption.
    Especially on a multiuser machine. Things like Watchdog on PCs is OK
    because the PC wasn't going to do anything but wait for I/O anyhow.

On a PC it seems to me that you can get reasonable performance
from cryptography done in software.  There are DES's floating around
that can do 100 kbytes/sec.  This is an order of magnitude faster
than a floppy disc, though a lot slower than a hard disk.

Dan, perhaps RIPEM in "-m mic-only" mode would be sufficient.  You and
your correspondant don't need to worry about key management at
all with this scheme.  Even though RIPEM will sign the message
when you "encrypt" it, the sender can read the message even
if s/he does not know your public key. (Though RIPEM will 
issue a warning message in this case.)  And you as the 
sender do not need to know the recipient's public key
in mic-only mode.

     RC2 has been approved for export with 40-bit keys.  This implies that
NSA (and maybe others) almost certainly don't think RC2 with a 40 bit key
will keep them out of anything they want to read.  More disturbing, RC2
is being distributed in a lot of packages for widespread use.  It's clearly
not going to be used by anyone who thinks their data is worth millions of
dollars (unless they're ignorant of its weaknesses).  So, it seems likely
that RC2 with 40-bit keys is not just *breakable* by NSA (whose huge com-
puting resources probably bring 56-bit DES within their grasp, as well),
but is probably fairly *easy* for NSA to break.  This might imply that, with
a grasp of how the algorithm works, it could be broken in hours on a
workstation.  (It also might imply hours on a supercomputer.  The NSA has
a *lot* of computing power.)
 
     The RC2 algorithm is unpublished.  Perhaps you could ask a representative
of RSA whether its remaining unpublished is one of the conditions of its
fast-track approval for export.  (My impression was that this *is* one of
the conditions of its pre-approval for export, but I am not certain.)  Since
it's unpublished, there is a chance that it's really a terribly weak algorithm.
It's even possible that with long keys, it has some weaknesses that RSA's
people aren't aware of.  At any rate, it's nothing I'd trust to protect
anything very confidential.
 
     All that said, if the alternative is putting in some sort of weak
home-grown encryption scheme (ie, XORing the output from a simple random
number generator against the plaintext), RC2 is probably a better choice.
If you can, it would be nice if you'd note in the user documentation for
the product that RC2 is *not* high-security encryption.  Probably better
than PKZIP's encryption scheme, or WP51's, but nothing to use with really
valuable data.

   Good luck with your decision.  If you get any further information on
RC2 that's not told to you in confidence (or under a nondisclosure agree-
ment), I'd really appreciate hearing it.

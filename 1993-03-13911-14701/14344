By the prime number theorem, there will be 2^512 / ln( 2^512 ) primes up to
length 512 bits.  That's many orders of magnitude more than (insert
favourite measure of what constitues a big number).  I don't think you need
to worry about this...

(BTW this question is answered in a number of places, for example the RSA
FAQ).

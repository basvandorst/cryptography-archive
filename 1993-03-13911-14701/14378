All security is relative to the attack.  We have done pretty much what you
describe and have found very few people in the commercial software user
community will go to great lengths to crack even a simple protection mechanism.
Loss of sales $$ to customers who circumvent such is very little.  (You must
decide if this is the case for you.)

As such, any mechanism you implement should be simple and cheap itself,  
for you will 'pay' in increased support costs and this cost should not be 
higher than the increased sales from protected s/w.

We have used a crc based system because crc's are cheap to calculate and
implement.  Munging it and not advertising the nature of the mung works
for us.

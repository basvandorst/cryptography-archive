The most-cited paper on the subject is

@article{sharesecret,
   author = {Adi Shamir},
   journal = {Communications of the ACM},
   number = {11},
   pages = {612--613},
   title = {How to Share a Secret},
   volume = {22},

Gifford presents ways to implement all sorts of combinations:

@article{sealing,
   author = {David K. Gifford},
   journal = {Communications of the ACM},
   number = {4},
   pages = {274--286},
   title = {Cryptographic Sealing for Information Secrecy and Authentication},
   volume = {25},
   year = {1982}
}

A good overview of the whole subject, with a large bibliography, is in

@incollection{Simmons92,
        author = {Gustavus J. Simmons},

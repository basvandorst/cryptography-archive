Fortunately, there are a *lot* of big primes.  A famous result in
number theory says that asymptotically $\Pi(x)$, the number of
prime numbers $\leq x$, is given by $\Pi(x) \sim \frac{x}{\log x}$,
or equivalently that the derivative $\frac{\partial \Pi(x)}{\partial x}$,
the probability that a randomly chosen integer near $x$ is prime,
is asymptotically $\sim \frac{1}{\log x}$.  (All logs are base $e$,
though factors of order unity don't matter here anyway.)

Hence the number of primes between (say) $2^{N}$ and $2^{N+1}$ is
about $\frac{2^N}{\log 2^N} \sim 2^{N - \log N}$.  For N=512 (1024)
this is $2^{503} \approx 10^{151}$ ($2^{1014} \approx $10^{304}$).

Note that there are "only" $10^{\sim 85}$ hydrogen atoms in the
known universe!  I think we can safely say that this "brute force"
attack isn't going to be doable in any of our lifetimes, to put
it mildly.  Of course, the problem of factoring big numbers may
be broken, and/or fancy hardware may make 1024 bit keys insecure,
and/or a way to crack RSA without factoring bignums may be found,
but there's no need to fear this brute-force attack -- the RSA keyspace
is way too big.

Note, of course, that this argument assumes that the RSA keyspace is
really the full set of big primes.  In reality, certain classes of
primes are bad.  There are still lots of good ones left, though...

No.  At least, it's not registered with their name server, nor is any
host with a similar name.  I did a complete zone transfer and checked
the only two hosts that were listed with a WKS record containg ftp; of
the two, dove.nist.gov does not accept anonymous login and while
enh.nist.gov does, the stuff there seems to be mostly Internet and
Usenet related.  Back to square one.

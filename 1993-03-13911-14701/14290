	You don't really.  Such things are called false solutions.
Given certain characteristics, and the size of the text, there is a
formula for determining the number or percentage of false solutions.
Generally it is unlikely, and if one is decrypting a file, you will
figure they will have a slight gist of what it was about beforehand.

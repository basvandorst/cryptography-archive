Yes, that explains the misunderstanding. I guess that "PGP"
pretty much means "strong crypto freeware" to me. And this
is exactly what I believe is needed for storage. Now that
we have secure communications, why shouldn't we have secure
storage?

Some posters have indicated that there are products that
might satisfy the needs. Perhaps someone could do a survey
on such systems?


On a totally unrelated note: Military Cryptanalysis III&IV
were advertised in the latest issue of Cryptologia. I can't
remember reading on sci.crypt that they had actually been
declassified, but appearently they have. Sorry if this was
old news. How about a review, anyone?

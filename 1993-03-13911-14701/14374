Absolutely correct.  My argument was statistical:  If the "book" used in the
code were a sequence of letters generated according to the statistics of
English, then the statistical attacks I describe would be the only approach,
and the result of combining 3 "books" would indeed be a good one-time pad.
As Mr. Gillogoly points out, statistics only take you so far:  If you use
real books, you are choosing from a small enough universe that attacks going
beyond the raw statistics will kill you.

One can, of course, extend the technique.  If a "book" is a real book chosen
from a known collection, its entropy is quite a bit lower than for a synthetic
book.  But it still has SOME entropy, and if you combine enough such books,
you do get a random source.  Of course, the collection of books has to be
large enough ... the entropy of a book chosen from a selection of 100 books
is probably low enough that you can't draw enough books from the collection
to get a random source.

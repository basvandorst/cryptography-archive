   someone asked a question something like this:
   with the talks of federal agencies raiding politically incorrect organizations

   a 'stacker' like utility for encrypting your entire drive?

This probably rates as a Frequently Asked Question, and there have
been a number of people and vendors who distribute such things,
for the PC market, various Unix systems, and maybe Macintosh.
Most of them are commercial, and some are probably free.  (Matt?)

At least one vendor for a 386 Unix product offers a set of products which do
compression, encryption, and something else useful.

A typical PC product design from 3 years ago would include an 
maybe-optional board with a DES chip or microprocessor,
and give you a choice of DES or a fast proprietary algorithm,
presumably just obscure, not very secure.  Probably it would encrypt
each disk block using the same key, maybe with CBC within the disk block,
or maybe getting fancy and using the disk block number as a salt.

RISC machines and 486s have enough horsepower to do the job without
performance suffering too badly, though DES chips probably are a win,
and are available for Suns and PCs.

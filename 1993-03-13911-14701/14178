Jim doesn't say how he computes the IC for each of these values of N.  That
suggests that the reader divide the text into portions, form a histogram of
the letters in each bucket, compute the IC of each histogram and average
the results.

I believe it was Deavours & Kruh (Machine Cryptography and Modern
Cryptanalysis) but it might have been Sinkov (or even someone else in my
reading -- sorry) who gave a simpler method of computing the average IC for
this case (by hand):

	Make two copies of the ciphertext as a long strip.

	Shift one of them N places to the right of the other.

	Count the number of characters which are the same at any given
	position.

	Divide by the total number of characters in the overlap. (ie.,
	(M-N) if there are M characters of ciphertext)

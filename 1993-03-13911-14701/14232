Has anyone run across source code to any of the following:
NIST's Secure Hash Standard/Secure Hash System
NIST's Digital Signature Standard (it's current proposed version)?

For that matter, anyone run across the algorithm description for SHS/SHA? 
I have DSS courtesy of the July 1992 issue of Communications of the ACM...

Thanks!

Of course they're not totally predictable.  However, the object is to have
all input bytes carry full entropy.  Bytes of output from compress gain
entropy as the process goes on.

So -- if you want to increase the entropy of those initial bytes, you can
add some by XOR with true random bytes.  You don't have to do this for very
long -- just until the compress output gets up to the final entropy per byte
it will achieve.

Has anyone done an experiment yet to determine how far that is?

Eg., one might take a number of different messages and compress them all
individually and gather a histogram for each byte position for the first
few hundred...then compute entropy from each histogram.......

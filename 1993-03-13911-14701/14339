I think this has something to do with the frequency characteristics of the
human ear in an open field, as well as that of the brain. Hughes Aircraft,
for example, invented a system which takes advantage of this knowledge in
order to simulate 3-dimensional sound from two speakers fed by an "ordinary"
but post-processed stereo signal. The system, called SRS, is licensed to,
for example, Sony for many of its high-end TV sets. I have one and it's
pretty impressive.

(I don't want to touch off a discussion of SRS here--some argue the
reproduction is unrealistic.)

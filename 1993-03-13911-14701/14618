Well, you've got me there. Everybody has to take some things on trust :)
I, for example, trust others who tell me the Earth is round. I've never
checked it myself. I'd love to, but nobody wants to provide the facilities.
I consider the risk that my trust is ill founded to be small. Yes, it could
all be a conspiracy. But probably not. Not when we still can't even hide
our illegal alien babysitters <grin>

The job is more than five minutes work, which is why others here have seemed a
little incredulous at your asking. Anyway, I think such empircal tests _have_
been done. You're right about tricky proofs being, well, tricky. Nobody
can resist a little test just to be sure!

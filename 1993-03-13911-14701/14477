]512 -what-? 512 bits? 512 decimal digits? Length of what? Of the
]moduli or of the primes that construct them?

Vesselin goes on to give an analysis which is correct, so far as
I can tell.  However, it doesn't actually matter whether the
length is in bits, digits or bytes; neither does it matter
whether the length is of the primes or of the moduli.  To see
this, make the best possible assumption: 512-bit moduli.  At
least one factor must be smaller than 256 bits (note that RSA
moduli need not consist of only two prime factors, nor need they
have factors of about the same size).  The number of primes
smaller than 2^256 is approximately 2^256/ln(2^256).  According
to bc(1), this comes to 6.5e74

Just to store all these numbers is going to take an amount of
matter comparable to the entire known universe.  There are
something like 1e80 - 1e85 particles known in the universe:
so one prime per billion particles.

]Attacking RSA by brute force factoring is the most silly way to attack

What you haven't made clear, perhaps, is that David's approach is
equivalent to brute force factoring by dividing all moduli by
all the primes up to the square root.

Current technology is (slightly) more advanced than you state.
With my feeble resources, I can factor 100-digit numbers in a
reasonable time -- a year or so.  I have factored 92-digit ones
in less than a month.  100 digits is 333 bits.

The real big boys -- the ones with MasPars, Connection Machines,
thousands of workstations, etc -- are currently factoring
120-digit numbers in the same timescale.  This corresponds to 400
bit numbers.  This year, Lenstra and Bernstein are planning to
crack *the* RSA modulus.  (For the uninitiated, when the RSA
algorithm was described in Scientific American back in 1977, a
prize of $100 was offered to the first factorizer of

11438162575788886766923577997614661201021829672124
23625625618429357069352457338978305971235639587050
58989075147599290026879543541

which has 129 digits, or 425 bits.)

512-bit moduli are looking decidedly fragile if they are to be
used to protect *important* data against the likes of GCHQ and
NSA.  1024-bit moduli look ok.  Both of these claims assume that
the organizations have only better machines, rather than better
algorithms.  To protect unimportant data from the likes of me,
even 384-bit moduli will be adequate for a few years.

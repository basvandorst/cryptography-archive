Please forgive my ignorance.  What is the 'General number field sieve'?  Is it a clever way to factor in parallel?  Or, is some new 'cosmic' breakthru?  Is it easy to scale?  I would imagine it would be MUCH easier for me to double the number of bits in an RSA key (perhaps to 2048 bits), than to for GNFS to crack.  

No flames please!

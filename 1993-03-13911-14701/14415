An RSA number constructed as the product of two primes generally will
NOT be very close to the perfect power of an integer. This is what makes
NFS effective for 2^n - 1 [or similar].

No. I mean that generally pq does not have a representation as a polynomial
with very small coefficients. Such numbers are easy to factor (relatively
speaking).

Understood...  However, I have periodically discussed these things in this
newsgroup. It gets tiresome after a while to keep repeating the same
thing. It is also tiresome to have to correct the (same) misstatements
made about the difficulty of factoring.  I will be happy to answer questions,
but dislike having to correct erroneous claims.

This is the problem. Please *become* initiated before making such

I'm not trying to flame you or insult you. I'm just tired of having

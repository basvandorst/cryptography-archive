David, as usual, is wrong.

First, there is not a single line of code copyrighted by PKP in PGP.
It may be a patent violation, but it cannot be a copyright violation.

In any case, determining the exportability of an item is unrelated to 
whether it is a violation of copyrights or patents. The ITARs seem to
say that if information is available to the general public it cannot
be export controlled, and it would seem that PGP is available to the
general public. It is possible that PKP could sue the authors of PGP
for patent infringement, but that is a civil matter completely
unrelated to the ITARs.

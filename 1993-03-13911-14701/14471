LofC depends on those copyright submissions. One disadvantage is that
there is no requirment re: delivery time. The LofC saves money by not

This makes it difficult to read Telephony, for example. (Hint -
Arlington County Lib. does get it ;_}

I think the submission requirment goes back to Ben Franklin and/or
the founding charter of the LofC, but I'm not sure.

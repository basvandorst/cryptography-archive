Noone factors big primes. It is a waste of time. That is why they are called
*primes*.

No, because such an exercize would be pointless. One can PROVE that
256 bit numbers are prime using (essentially) the Cohen-Lenstra
algorithm in just a few minutes on any Sparcstation.

Further, even if one tried the Quadratic Sieve algorithm on such
a prime, all it would yield yepeatedly would be congruences of
the form A^2 = B^2 mod N  with either A=B or A=-B. One could not
know except probabilistically whether N was prime or whether one
one was simply unlucky.  The algorithm constructs such A and B and
if N has 2 prime factors there is a 50% probability that A=B or
A=-B regardless of whether N is prime or composite. QS really is
a probabilistic method (which behaves deterministically in practice)

The same essentially applies to NFS.

All very well and good, but if you really need to produce decimal random
digits, you'll find a 20-sided die with each of the ten digits recorded
on two faces works very well.  In fact, I have one sitting beside me.

A bit of trivia:  the 4-sided die (regular convex polyhedron) is the only
one that does not have parallel surfaces.  This means that in it's stable
position, there is no "top" to read.  Of course, you could read the bottom,
but this would involve picking it up, and thus create a condition ripe for
a dispute.  To circumvent this, my 4-sided die has three numbers embossed
on each side -- each number perpendicular to an edge -- and arranged so that
the "upright" number is the same on each visible face, regardless of which
side is "down".  Kind of a neat trick (and given the current state of things,
probably patentable).

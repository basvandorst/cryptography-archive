I have placed the recently-posted sci.crypt FAQ on ripem.msu.edu.
It's available via anonymous FTP, unlike the crypto *software* there.

This is by no means the official home of the sci.crypt FAQ, but
it seemed natural to add it to the other crypto stuff at this
site.

Many thanks to L. Detweiler, Dan Bernstein, and others who
contributed to bringing the sci.crypt FAQ to the light of day.

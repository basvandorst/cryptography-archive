This is not even vaguely like a one time pad.

The encryption alphabet is likely to be different for each character of
the message (depending on repeated characters in either of the keys)
but statistically they are nothing like random, as there will be
detectable correlations between them. The job is harder as the LCM gets
longer, but is in fact still easier than having a single key the length
of the message.

Now comes the point; if the key is also text, a 26x26 frequency
analysis allows you to break both the message and the key simultaneously.

Only if the bytes of the key are truly random is this a one time pad,
but then they are hard to remember...

Yes, it would be like the photocopy-proof paper that has the image printed
on red-pink paper that turned black in the photocopying process. 

I've heard that the new copying machines can identify currency and refuse
to photocopy it. Perhaps the copying machines could be programmed to 
recognize a certain low-level noise in the image and refuse to copy
an image when the low-level noise falls in a certain pattern?

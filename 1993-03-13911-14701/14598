:Disagreement. Look at this message:
:Data=Encrypt(Message+Signature(Message))
:Encrypt= 'Applying the receivers public key to the (...)data'
:Sign   = 'Applying MD5(for example) on the Message, then encrypting
:          the MD5-hash with he senders secret key'
:
:The attacker can NOT strip a signature, unless he is able to decrypt
:'data' with the secret key of the receiver.
:The receiver is NOT able to generate a signature for any other message
:than the one he received, as he does not know the secret key of the
:sender.
:
:Please remember that 'signing messages' does not mean a lot of 
:authentification, unless public keys are certified by an entity
:to which the sender and recipient have trust. (They can sign each others
:public key, if you want :-) )

Close but not precise.  Observe the signatured Data 
If the receiver is not trustworthy (the premise for need for digital
signature), he/she can decrypt the message and subsequently encrypt
the message for a different key set i.e, another receiver.  The 
new receiver is in no position to determine if the message he/she
has received with the sender's signature is actual sent by the
sender or was redirected.  In fact the new receiver cannot figure
out the original 'intended' recepient.  Hence the above argument for the
loss of assurance of communicating party identities.  The drawback
is only the loss of assurance of identities and not that of modification
of data or disclosure of data.

If the message or the digest have any reference to the sender and/or
receiver names/identities, such indirect signaturing can be detected.
In fact this requirement seems to be (to me) mandatory for proper 
non-repudiation of the sender and the receiver.

try for truth you may atleast discover the untruth

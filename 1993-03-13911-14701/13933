   Since no-one has cracked any of the Dolphin ciphertext I posted,
   and no-one has offered to show us how real cryptanalysis might
   proceed, I suppose we can conclude that (i) the encryption software is
   not obviously insecure and (ii) testing it more rigorously would
   involve more effort than the expected return would justify.


well, you were really asking the wrong question.


*real* cryptanalysis would likely notice that you were using a batch
file this way and would try undeleting files on your disk.  unless
you scrub the disk very well, the decrypted files are likely to be
easily recovered.


i would recommend you decrypt to a ram disk.

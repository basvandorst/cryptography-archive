	I had intended to follow-up the original message but I had
	to be away from the net for too long.

	The original article stated that Rusbridger was a former MI6
	officer.  According to his own book (The Intelligence Game)
	this is not the case.  He occasionally did some contract and
	freelance work for them.  It would also be fair to say that
	his view of the field is jaundiced and that many of his
	conclusions are based on idiosyncratic interpretations.

I have to agree with David here.  He made an effort to insure his post was
an "I really don't know please tell me" post instead of a "I am arguing that"
post.  I read this newsgroup to learn about cryptology.  Jumping down someone's
throat when they ask a reasonable question does not make it any easier for
someone trying to broaden their understanding.  It's not like he reinvented
the Vingere(?) cipher; and look how civil everyone was to the last guy who
did.  What kind of intellectual discussions are we going to have if everyone
has an itchy flame finger.

ObCrypt:  While it has been demonstrated that there are enough large primes to
          make exhaustive key search impossible, how easy is it to generate 
          those large prime?  Are there any regularities in the current prime
          generation techniques that might be exploited?

-Tim Cuffel	Finger for PGP 2.1  The CIA has admitted that the assassination
                                    of Saddam Hussien was one of their goals.
They failed, of course.  Seems as though that motorcade through downtown Dallas
trick only works once.

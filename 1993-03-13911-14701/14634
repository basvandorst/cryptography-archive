I'm not sure why. You specify the range of the prime (if I remember the
algorithm correctly) as input to the process. So nothing special is known
about the primes generated. I believe there is a relationship between the
random seed (which must have as many digits as the prime to be generated)
and the resulting prime, but it is uniform enough that clustering helpful
to a cracker doesn't occur.

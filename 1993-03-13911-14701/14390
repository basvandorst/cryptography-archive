Indeed, about a year ago, mink@coyote.datalog.com (Clint Ruoho) posted
a message that contained what I consider a fair bit of evidence that
some kind of trap door exists.  I will reproduce his posting below.
I've never used Norton's Diskreet precisely because of this posting.

I've also never taken the time to see if I could verify & crack the 
backdoor, because there's never been enough motivation to do so.  
Now, if someone would make it worth some money...   ;-)

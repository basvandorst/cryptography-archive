	I'd think you'd need a sensitive microphone to gather the
outside sound, and then use the to cancel the outside sounds from
the inside sounds, somehow. I'm pretty ignorant of high end audio
but I can't imagine this is too hard. Don't the high end speaker
phones for teleconferencing already do this today?

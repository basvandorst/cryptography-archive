I think the key concept here is that you can't _guarantee_ from software
that the data is unrecoverable.  In most cases, if you overwrite it enough
it will be gone, but not always.

For instance, suppose you write confidential data to disk.  Then you
overwrite the data with junk and expect the first data to be gone.
Now, it's possible that the alignment of the write head shifted a little bit
between when you wrote the confidential data and when you overwrote it with
junk.  In this case, you may not have overwritten the entire width of
the track and it would be possible to recover the confidential data from
the unoverwritten part of the track.

Another thing I've heard about is that what you write to the disk
depends on what was there before.  Suppose you write a 1 to the disk.  If
there were a 1 there before, the magnetic field will be stronger than it
would be if there were a 0 before.  So you end up with something on disk like:
1 written over 1:   magnetic strength 1.01 (I'm making up these numbers.)
1 written over 0:   magnetic strength 0.99
0 written over 0:   magnetic strength 0.00
0 written over 1:   magnetic strength 0.01
Now, a sufficiently clever reader could determine not only what was written
to the disk, but also what was overwritten, by closely examining the signals
on the disk.  Thus, overwriting data once is not sufficient to erase it.
Rumor has it that you can recover data this way even after multiple
overwrites.

Disclaimer: This is just what I've heard.  I have no idea if it's actually
true.

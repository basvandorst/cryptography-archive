	Actually, for something like general purpose filesystem access,
it seems crazy to make your general purpose CPU do all the encryption.
Especially on a multiuser machine. Things like Watchdog on PCs is OK
because the PC wasn't going to do anything but wait for I/O anyhow.
There are a couple of folks who sell encrypting SCSI controllers (I
do not know the details of how they work) that presumably require the
systems admin to somehow unlock the disk before it can be used. I
don't know it that's DOS-specific or not. Computer Elektronik Infosys
sells not only a high speed DES chip that can handle 100 megabits/sec,
they sell cryptDISK, cryptTAPE, and cryptDAT. If I were looking at
locking up more than a trivial amount of data, I'd go with hardware.
There are a plethora of EISA/ISA bus encrypting disk controllers
for DOS machines. The guy who writes device drivers to talk to one
for BSDI and/or BSD386 might have a fun and useful product. :)

	It's pretty amazing the infosec hardware you can buy off
the shelf these days. One interesting source of new product data is
ISPNews (InfoSecurity Product News) (free to "qualified" readers or
$36/year - it's one of those magazines that is 99% ad) They can be
reached at:
	ISPNews
	MIS Training Institute Press, Inc.
	498 Concord St.
	Framingham, MA 01701    (508)879-9792

	Other fun folks who sell products of interest to internet
paranoiacs are Cylink (408)735-5800. Cylink sells a complete line
of link security products, including a nifty-sounding 9600-baud
DES-encrypting modem that can also handle voice encryption (the
STM-9600) and a variety of high-speed encrypting routers and
bridges (56kb to fractional T1 with DES). AT&T makes a plug-in
voice encryptor that uses DES - you won't find it at your local
phone store, but their secure communications sales group [I don't
know their number but I bet AT&T is in the phone book] can help.
The AT&T encryption unit will probably be doing voice too, soon.
Another company that has a wide range of Nifty Crypto Toys is
Mobius (202)429-2079 who sell FAX encryptors, PC encryption
boards, etc, etc. Fischer International (who do Watchdog on the
PC) also sell a large variety of LAN encryption devices of
various flavors. They even have one cute thing that sits and
pings nodes to check their state and fires off alarms if you
take your machine off the network or reboot it or whatever.
Fischer is at (800)237-4510. And of course there is Motorola's
secure communications folks (800)747-3330. The prices on all this
stuff are higher than for ordinary modems or routers or whatnot,
but they're not unreasonable. You can't export it, of course.

	Note - I am not associated with any of the organizations
listed above, nor do I recommend any products, nor have I actually
seen or used the stuff listed above. This is just a quick flip
through some of the fun toys available. You can collect stacks
of glossies from these folks and keep them in your briefcase
and try to convince your friends you're James Bond.

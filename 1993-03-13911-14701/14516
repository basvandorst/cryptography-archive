I'm interested in Vigenere ciphers and the classical 

methods by which any particular Vigenere Key might be 

found given a reasonably long piece of ciphertext.

Can anybody direct me to an FTP site where I might 

find  C code (a) allowing Vigenere encryption of text 

using a user-defined key and (b) allowing  analysis

of Vigenere ciphertext ( perhaps even allowing digram/

trigram frequencies to be explored )? 

	Thanks for your time,

Yes, but with three keystrokes I can take a snapshot of anything
displayed on my screen.  I don't even care what form of encryption you
use, or what info you hide in the executable - as soon as you display
it, you've done my work for me.  Now there's the problem of any hidden
bits you've put in your picture, or messages in your palette, but a
quick JPEG will take care of that.

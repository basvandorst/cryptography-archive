Marc, thanks a million.  This is the first really good post I've seen
on this subject.  Unfortunately, I'm not sure I agree with you.

I think you are finessing the issue here.  If the thief uses lossy
compression won't this change many bits?  Would changes to randomly
selected low order bits survive?

Key issue.  Say the thieves use a different method.  Say they choose
a random value for the tag bit?  Say they use a deterministic method
like always setting it to 0 of 1?  I think your analysis breaks down.

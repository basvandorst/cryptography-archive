For triple DES we have something that looks like this:

    key1 -> encrypt -> key2 -> decrypt -> key1 -> encrypt

How would one extend the concept of triple encryption to multiple
encryption with n>3? For example if you had 3 keys (or one key split
into 3 parts) how would you encrypt the file? Would it increase the
security at all?

We may be miscommunicating. I was not aware that RSA had ever formally
abandoned any of their copyrights. As to the patent, as we've all agreed ad
nauseum, it doesn't apply outside the U.S. But it would inside. And I think
we ARE talking about "inside" since the discussion is about the making PGP
public domain to avoid ITAR. 

Recall that my comment was about PGP including RSA/PKP's patented and
copyright stuff, so that a simple declaration that PGP was public domain
wouldn't suffice. PGP's author has no standing to declare the property of
another public domain, even (or maybe especially) if he's taken it without
permission.

There have been many complaints in sci.crypt about discussions of this kind
being inappropriate for this newsgroup, so I suggest that if you agree, we
take follow-ups to e-mail.

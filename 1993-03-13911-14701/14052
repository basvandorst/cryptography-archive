Some time ago, during the DAT (Digital Audio Tape) copy-protection
discussions, I considered using spread spectrum technique to encode
data bits into CD's so that the DAT machine can read the bits and
refuse to copy the material.

Brief summary of spread spectrum: in normal radio transmision, the
signal is sent on one carrier (that is one frequency). This works
fine but is subject to jamming and the signal is rather easy to
snatch. Spread spectrum splits the signal into many pieces and
sends each piece on a different carrier. Thus, jamming any one
frequency is useless and snatch the signal is harder (you have to
know which set of frequency is used). Of course, you could also
use frequency hopping - change the freqencies of the carriers
periodically.

Using spread sprectum, one could encode a bit stream into the
CD material or a picture. Since the encoding introduces very
little noise into each frequency, the picture ought to be "almost"
the same.

The jam-resistance may well carry over to the point that the
bit-stream may survive lossy compression. (I think this means
that you want to use low frequencies since lossy compression
usually lose high frequency. But I definitely don't know enough
about either topic to say).

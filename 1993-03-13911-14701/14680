:No, that doesn't produce a UNIQUE prime for each n.  In fact, it will never
:produce a unique prime for any value of n greater than 2.
 
Change it to:

	bignum P (bignum n) {
		z = n*n+1
		while (!is_probable_prime (z))
			z++;
		return z;
 
And it will return a unique prime if Cramer's conjecture is true.
In fact, one can even use a conj. a lot weaker than Cramer's:
there is always a prime between N and N + SQRT(N). The best proved
result is that there is always a prime between N and N + N^(11/20 + epsilon)

I also believe that there is a fully proved result that might be used
in place of n^2 above.  There are some inequalities of Rosser and
Schoenfeld  for p_n  that might be useful. I don't remember the
exact inequalities offhand and will have to look them up.

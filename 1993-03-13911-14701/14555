	Peleg and Rosenfeld of UM wrote an article back in the 70's (I
think) in the CACM describing a method for determining single
subsitution ciphers by the use of a relaxation method that was being
used for image processing.  I've read the article a few times,
(maybe it was a condenced form..) and the math is a bit beyond me, but
I might give it a go and trying to figure it all out.
	Has anyone implemented this method, or are they familiar with
it at all?  Has this probabilistic method been applied towards
deciphering other classical problems?
	I was considering writing such a problem myself, but I
couldn't figure exactly how to do it, just frequency analysis itself
wouldn't work, combined with a digram, I met get some good matches,
but I didn't want to reinvent a complex algorithm for it.  I found
this, and the method seems _very_ effective.

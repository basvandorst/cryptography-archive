I'd like to publicly thank you for giving us net-flamers a lesson in civility,
and for reminding us that there is a "kinder, gentler" way of discussing
these issues.

You've been very harshly criticized in this newsgroup in the past, and I'm not
surprised that you don't follow it closely any more. Just recently we had a
minor flareup in the "can I trust my government" debate, and once again you
were the subject of ad hominem attacks. Thank you for showing us all the proper
way to respond in such a situation.

I sincerely hope that this group can avoid a new flame war on key registration.
The last war has barely ended. We don't need another one quite so soon.

Please, everyone, let's not flame key registration here for a while!!!

The Sesame project is still in progress so it is slightly premature for
the participants to publish all of their material, although they recently
presented a report to the European Commission.

For those who haven't heard of Sesame it is a collaborative project
between Bull, ICL, and SNI (formerly Nixdorf), partly funded by the
European Commission.  The project is investigating authentication and
delegation in distributed systems.

The aim is to provide a consistent security architecture rather than
a building block.  In this sense Kerberos might be considered to be a
component that could be integrated into a Sesame system rather than as
a direct competitor to Sesame.

Tom Parker, an ICL Research Fellow, published several papers describing
the Sesame architecture; these present a useful introduction to their
design.  Several other documents have been presented to the Commission,
the Sesame End User Group, and to certain interested parties, but they
have not as yet been released to the general public.

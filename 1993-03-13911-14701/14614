Read your first line. The attack the suggestion was guarding against was
the brute force method with automatic recognition of the output ( after
all no human can look at the 2^56 output texts to see if one of the keys
got it right) DES IS designed apparently against known plaintext
attacks. The additional protection is against brute force attacks with
auto recogonition of output.
I also agree that triple DES say would probably be a much better defence
against brute force. But the thread was whether or not NSA could build a
brute force attack machine, which would of necessity have an auto
recognition system as well. Remember you need 10^10 or so decryptions a
second to break a system in a year. Anything that slows the decryptions
or the identification, even by a small amount ( after all even with 10^6
seperate processors, you still have to do each one in 10^-4 sec) is a
win.

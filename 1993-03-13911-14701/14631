Because a while has passed since I last said something on a subject
I know nothing about (it must have been at least since this morning),
I'm going out on a limb to say this analysis seems a little oversim-
plified.  It seems we're not selecting just one out of 2^64 ciphertexts
for one plaintext, but rather one out of the permutations of 2^64
plaintexts taken 2^64 at a time, i.e., one out of the 2^64 FACTORIAL
ways of associating plaintexts and ciphertexts, when we choose our
key.  Am I missing something here?

Colin, the posting quite distinctly said "March 6th," which is a
Saturday according to all of my calendars.

If you had said "available March 7th," then nobody would have been
particularly disappointed that it took a "whole extra day" for 2.2 to
arrive.  People don't generally get annoyed when you take an extra day
to release the program.  When they're not paying anything for it, they
have little excuse to complain about tardiness.  If they wanted it
faster, they could have paid more :-).

But if you SAID March 6th, don't be shocked when people interpret it
to mean you actually mean to release the files on March 6th, and that
they're annoyed when the files aren't released RIGHT THEN.

I think you'd have been better off waiting 'til March 7th, and then
saying "PGP 2.2 is now available.  Look for it at these sites..."
Fewer mobs of angry would-be cryptographists carrying torches, out for
blood...  (I'm now being silly :-))

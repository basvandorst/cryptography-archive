Several observations:

1. This will not work terribly well at all for those who are visually
impaired, or for those with cognitive difficulties involving recognition.

2. If eight of the nine have been chosen at random from a very large
database, then there is a small but finite chance that more than one face
will be known to the user.

3. I doubt I'd recognize myself some mornings (before coffee), let alone
anyone else.

4. "Borrowing" someone's photo albums and copying all the pictures, and
subsequently studying them, would seem an effective way to crack this system.
This process would be even easier for anyone who worked in a local photo
developing shop and who had regular customers...

First it doesn't matter where you evaluate the polynomial as long as it
is agreed on before hand and is not one of the distributed points.

Second using 0 makes selecting the polymonial trivial, just use the key
as the constant term and N random values as the coefficients, with
the limit that the highest order term can't be zero.

You method of selecting the polynomial is no more secure then any other
other method that works, it just cost more then using the evaluate at 0
method.

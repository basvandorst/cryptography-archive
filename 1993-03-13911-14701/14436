RSA can be attacked in an indirect way.  If one considers RSA to be
covering the actual data with two envelopes, one for the sender and
one for the receiver, then following indirect signatures can be
obtained.

If the outer envelope is for the sender, the active attacker can strip
sender's signature and sign it himself/herself thus masquerading as
an originator.  If the outer envelope is for the receiver, the
receiver if compromised or if unethical can strip his/her envelope
and obtain an envelope with sender's signature on it.  The
receiver can then re route the message with some one else as the
intended recipient.

These two attacks destroy the assurance of the identities of the 
communicating entities. (jees! then what to believe, especially if
sender and receiver identities are not in the message too)

Actually, you should look at the work of Doug Tygar and Bennet Yee at
Carnegie Mellon.  They have build a single-board system that is entirely
encapsulated in tamper-proof packaging.  It includes DES hardware,
crypto-protocol code, and even runs Mach.  You can distribute programs
encrypted, and tied to an id on the board (which you can't access),
which is as unbreakable a scheme as the encryption methods used.  DES
may not be unbreakable, but it's way beyond the ability of your average
"Joe Hacker" to break.

Of course, this is cheating a little bit by requiring the software to
run on a special piece of hardware, but it's pretty close to unbreakable
software protection!

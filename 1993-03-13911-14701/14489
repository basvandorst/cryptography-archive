Well, you could use another OTP to send this OTP. :)

The one-time-pad assumes that the key text is truly random and as long as
all the ciphertext that this key will ever encrypt.  Because it is random,
you can not represent the key by any shorter quantity, and both sides can 
not generate it idependently.

So the answer to your question is that there is no way, which explains why 
we don't all use the one-time-pad.

The one-time-pad is the only cipher which has been PROVEN secure, but
remember that to get the consequence of a theorem, you must fulfill
the assumptions of the theorem.  An amazing number of people forget this.

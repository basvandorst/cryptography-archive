Besides 6mo is a perfectly reasonable lead time for a magazine such as
CACM.  So it is very likely that the article was submitted to CACM before
the start of the so called flame war.  If so then if Denning feels that nay 
response to the net discussion (.i.e.flame war) is necessary then a
follow-up article is the proper response.  But, I imagine that she will feel
that the probable set of letters to the editor that will be generated will 
likely cover anything that needs to be said.

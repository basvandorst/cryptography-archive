Very simple questions often have very simple answersv- maybe too simple 
to pop up in a discussion between experts. So, as a complete beginner,
(I follow this group mostly as a hobby) I must make it an explicit 
question to the experts...

Several people point out that the total number of primes is huge, eg.

But: For a 256-bit number to be usable as part of an RSA key, it must be
*known* to be a prime, right? There are certainly not 6.5e74 *known*
primes in 256 bits or less. So how many known ones are there?

Well, not the exact count, but of what magnitude is it? I would be 
surprised if there are more than can be stored on a medium-sized disk,
but I may be wrong. If a common man is to make himself a new key, he
won't start out factoring 256-bit numbers, he will pick from a book of
published primes and form a product of these - or am I wrong? 
So why couldn't anyone else with access to the same book generate the 
products of the primes, one by one, and try them in turn? Even though
the complexity of this is n**2 (n being the number of published primes),
it certainly wouldn't take hundreds of years!

It seems to me that the only ones with anywhere close to full 
protection are those identifying a new prime without publishing it. 
I am probably wrong, but where is my mistake?

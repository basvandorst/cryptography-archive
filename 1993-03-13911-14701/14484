I hope the members of Parliament are sensible enough to realize that merely
making eavesdropping a crime is not adequate protection of privacy, and
that legal protection is not ground for outlawing any technological
protection.  If civilian cryptology can be outlawed or severely restricted
on the ground that legal protection exists, then by the same token, civilian
use of doorlocks, or even the very installation of doors, could be banned
on the ground that burglary, murder, rape etc are crimes.  We know that this
is absurd.

We need technological protection, on top of legal protection, of our rights
because not all damages can be remedied, no matter how much compensation is
provided and how severely the criminal is punished.  No amount of money can
stop the discrimination an AIDS patient would face once knowledge of his/her
disease is divulged.

Even when damage can be remedied, people should still be allowed to choose
not to be harmed in the first place.

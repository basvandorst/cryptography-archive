Point well taken, although "rare" and "sparse" sound alike to me.  
I think Erdos' bound was something like  (x^(1/2))(log logx))/log(x), with a
suppressed constant factor which in principle could be large enough to
invalidate what  I wrote.  That is, unless you look at the proof carefully
enough to extract more precise finite estimates, you can't necessarily
conclude there are more squares than pseudoprimes in a given range.

Now the question:  has anyone actually seen the paper on Carmichael
numbers?  What I heard was that a lower bound of  n^k was shown for the
density (where k=1/3,  2/7, or 2/9 depending on who relays the
information...).  You seem to be saying that the asymptotic density was
determined up to a constant, which seems like too much to hope for.  What
is the precise result?

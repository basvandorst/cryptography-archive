A good summary, though I'd add a few caveats.  First, other, equally
respected cryptographers, notably Adi Shamir, don't think there's a
trap door in DES.  I've heard Shamir say that he thinks that the S-boxes
in DES are about as strong as could be.  That said, I have little doubt
that the NSA knows enough about cryptography that they can recover at
least some of the key more or less directly, and perform substantially
fewer than 2^56 iterations to recover the whole key.  I don't call that
a trap door per se; rather, I call it a skilled attacker who can partially
nullify a strong defense.  I'd reserve the phrase ``trap door'' for
something that was included deliberately, and there's absolutely no
evidence to support that theory.

The Garon and Outerbridge paper (Cryptologia, July '91) gives an
independent cost analysis of a DES-cracker, though I don't recall
their numbers off-hand.  But they agree with the basic conclusion:
use triple-encryption for critical applications.  And there's no
application more critical than key transmission.  If I can recover
a session key by brute force, I can then use that as sample plaintext
to recover the master key if you've used single encryption to send
the session key.  And that lets me read all your traffic, quite cheaply.

At Interop, a NIST representative said that a public key standard was
in the planning stages -- they realize that one is needed, and they do
plan to develop one.

	Which reminds me, try "Informing Statecraft" by Angelo
	Codevilla.  It's fairly recent and well informed.  AC was
	a researcher for one of the Joint Intelligence Committees
	and comes out with considerable detail.  The story about
	the NSA budget seems to be something of a canard.  The really
	big budget, as big as those of the CIA and the NSA combined,
	and ~150% of that of the NRO actually belongs another operation.
	The total U.S. intelligence budget is about $8*10^10.

Two existing examples come to mind,  Map makers and Encyclopedia makers.

Map companies move around details on the map so that anyone simply copying 
or digitizing their map will retain the same detailed changes.  These 
changes take the form of moving a road junction or a small town slightly.  
Some vague memory I have says that additional invalid data is created, which 
if replicated indicates copying.

Encyclopedia companies introduce hundreds of minor errors or extra facts to 
detect copying.

Come to think of it...software makers introduce extra hidden functions (such 
as Windows display of developers names and cartoon faces)...Hardware 
designers introduce nonfunctional traces on printed circuit boards.

Based on these ideas, I would suggest that adding some hidden feature of the 
picture via image processing is a viable approach.  Some examples...add an 
extra flower in the vase, add a bogus reflection in the window...add an 
extra glint in the eye...put on an extra mole on the person...etc...etc.

Removal is impossible (or difficult) because the change is unknown.  
Compression and size changing don't affect the signature because it is 
part of the image.

The key to all these ideas is to allow the information to contain some 
extra, erroneous or spurious data which appears to be valid.
The views expressed here are my own, not my employer's.

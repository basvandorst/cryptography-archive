Bob, you claim in public to know more than anyone else about
factorization---even though John Pollard knows strictly more than you do.
You claim in public to have more experience with the quadratic sieve
than anyone else---when it is others who have pushed the edge of both
the number and the size of QS factorizations. You feel no guilt in
claiming in public, without the slightest idea of whether you are
correct, that you have done more NFS factorizations than anyone else---
just because I never bothered pointing out that I've been factoring both
special and general numbers with NFS continuously since 1991. (I imagine
that Pollard has been doing so since 1988). You state your wild guesses
in public as if they were established facts, so long as they support
your current theories. You repeatedly, and in public, dismiss the work
of Pollard and others as ``irrelevant,'' knowing that Pollard is not on
the net.

For you to turn around now, and say that it is I who have insulted you,
is truly rich. I would never insult the work of Pollard or anyone else
the way you have; when I make a guess, I label it as what it is. Maybe,
just maybe, you shouldn't act so surprised or offended that you now get
a taste of your own USENET medicine.

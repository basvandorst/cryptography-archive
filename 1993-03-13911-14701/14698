Why don't you just admit you were wrong, instead of trying to wriggle
out through a semantic loophole? Whether the wiretaps on King and the
others were "national security related" or not is irrelevant. They
were blatantly illegal infringements on the constitutional rights of
US citizens, and they clearly demonstrate the utter foolhardiness of
trusting governments to respect those rights.

Indeed, it seems that the phrase "national security" is now the root
password to the Constitution. And as with any dishonest superuser,
the best user countermeasure is strong encryption.

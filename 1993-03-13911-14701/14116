The VCR+ system (aka Videoplus) was broken last year.  A paper
was published in Cryptologia, and code written to convert vcr+
codes to (channel,start,duration) triples and vice-versa.

This code (available by anon-ftp from black.ox.ac.uk:/src/vcr+.shar.Z)
does not work in the UK.  Over here, we have fewer channels and
less regular scheduling times.

A couple of people, iiitsh@pyramid.swansea.ac.uk and
mclaggan@movies.enet.dec.com, have now cryptanalysed the UK
version.  Code to handle all 3, 4, 5 and 6 digit codes is now
available as black.ox.ac.uk:/src/video+UK.zip

As a hint of things to come, progress seems to have been made on
cracking 7 and 8 digit codes.  Some of them are making sense, but
we are far from understanding all the details.

Credits:

Ken Shirriff et al.  for the original cryptanalysis
(sorry, I've mislaid the reference to Cryptologia, so I can't
glob the et al.)

Steve Hosgood and Doug Mclaggan for the UK crytpanalysis and C
programming.

I'm just a bystander with a ftp site and an interest in the 7&8
digit cryptanalysis.

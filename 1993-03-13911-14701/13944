       The classic is Friedman's "The Index of Coincidence", Riverbank
Publication #6.  This lays out the foundation of modern cryptanalysis
as a branch of mathematics.  Before Friedman, cryptanalysis was guessing;
after Friedman, it was theory and crunching.

       A facsimile edition would be a nice work.  Something like that
new edition of the Los Alamos Primer.

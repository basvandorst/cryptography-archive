   Well, you admit people are going to be able to look at the code... so anyone
   can decide what the messages 'really' are no matter what... IF they look at
   the code.  IF they don't, then the problem is how to camouflage the
   information... ie. the information is not what it APPEARS to be.  



it shouldn't be all that hard to embed a public key in the code.
getting the public key won't give them anything but a way to spoof
you, and won't give them a way to decrypt transmissions.

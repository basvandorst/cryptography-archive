On the topic of what can be encoded into a digital image, I would
recommend the paper "A Cautionary Note on Image Downgrading" by
Charles Kurak and John McHugh (both in the Dept of Computer Science at
the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill).  The paper was
presented at the 8th Annual Computer Security Applications Conference
(the one this past December in San Antonio) and is in the proceedings.
In short, they showed that it is relatively easy to hide one picture
under another.  A "signature" should be an easy thing to include.

The Abstract:

The results of an experiment that shows that it is very simple to
contaminate digital images with information that can later be
extracted are presented.  This contamination cannot be detected when
the image is displayed on a good quality graphics workstation.  Based
on these results, it is recommended that image downgrading based on
visual display of the image to be downgraded not be performed if there
is any threat of image contamination by Trojan horse programs.
Potential Trojan horse programs may include untrusted image processing
software.

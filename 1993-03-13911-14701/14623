A problem I have with this is the ease with which files can be tampered
with when sitting around on a BBS.  I feel I can better trust some well-
known sites (like ghost, black.ox, garbo, etc.), even if they are an
ocean away.

Instead let me toss out a suggestion for better non-net availability
for these sites.  A simple modem connection would suffice.  I personally
would have been willing to foot an international call for a premier crypto 
product.  The trustworthiness of the local BBS compared to a "real net
site" is my issue here.

Question to PGP carrying sites:  do you have a modem connection/phone line
that you would be willing to make extremely public for this purpose?

The BBS bandwidth could then best be utilized by storing text files
describing why something like PGP is great, and where to get it.  The
PGP doc files might be a good start.

Generally, I like the overall idea.  My read of the PGP docs indicates
that PGP was intended by the author exactly for this kind of
"grass-roots" handling.

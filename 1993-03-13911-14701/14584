(Please note I'm expanding the distribution of this thread; hopefully we
can get some more authoritative answers to some of these questions.  For
those seeing this for the first time, I've included more than the usual
amount of quoted material.)

	This is actually a very interesting point.  RFC1310 (on the
Internet Standards Process) states, in its section on patent policy
(section 6.1), that:

      Prior to approval of the specification as a Proposed Standard, the
      IAB shall receive from the known patent holders, in a form
      acceptable to and approved by the IAB, either (a) assurance in the
      form of a general disclaimer to the effect that the patent holder
      does not hold and does not anticipate holding any right that would
      be violated as a consequence of conformance to the standard, or
      (b) assurance that

      (1)  a license will be made available without compensation to all
           applicants desiring to utilize the patented items for the
           purpose of implementing the standard, or

      (2)  a license will be made available to applicants under
           specified reasonable terms and conditions that are, to the
           satisfaction of the IAB, demonstrably free of any unfair
           discrimination.

Now, PEM (Privacy Enhanced Mail) is governed by RFC1421.  In _its_ section
on patents, RFC1421 states (in regard to the four patents held by PKP):

   Public Key Partners has provided written assurance to the Internet
   Society that parties will be able to obtain, under reasonable,
   nondiscriminatory terms, the right to use the technology covered by
   these patents.  This assurance is documented in RFC 1170 titled
   "Public Key Standards and Licenses".  A copy of the written assurance
   dated April 20, 1990, may be obtained from the Internet Assigned
   Number Authority (IANA).

Hmmmm; looks pretty promising.  However, if one actually _reads_ RFC1170
(Public Key Standards and Licenses), we see only:

   Due to the broad acceptance of RSA digital signatures throughout the
   international community, Public Key Partners strongly endorses its
   incorporations in a digital signature standard.  We assure the
                               ^^^^^^^^^
   interested parties that Public Key Partners will comply with all of
   the policies of ANSI and the IEEE concerning the availability of
   licenses to practice this art.  Specifically, in support of any RSA
   signature standard which may be adopted, Public Key Partners hereby
   ^^^^^^^^^
   gives its assurance that licenses to practice RSA signatures will be
                                                     ^^^^^^^^^^
   available under reasonable terms and conditions on a non-
   discriminatory basis.

In other words, PKP is only guaranteeing "reasonable licensing conditions"
for RSA _signatures_, not _encryption_, which is not mentioned in PKP's
statement (RFC1170).

This being the case, doesn't adoption of RFC 1423 (PEM III: Algorithms,
Modes, and Identifiers) violate RFC 1310 (Internet Standards Process)?
After all, RFC 1423 _specifies_ in section 4.2 that:

   The RSAEncryption public-key encryption algorithm, defined in PKCS #1
   [11], is used for DEK and MIC encryption when asymmetric key
   management is employed.  The character string "RSA" within a "MIC-
   Info:" or "Key-Info:" header field indicates the use of this
   algorithm.

   All PEM implementations supporting asymmetric key management shall
   support this algorithm.

Thus, any PEM implementation (complying with RFC1421-23) _must_ implement
RSA _encryption_ for its DEK's.

What makes the whole question non-academic is the following scenario:
RFC1421-1423 do not specify an _exclusive_ list of cryptographic modes.
In particular, IDEA could be used as the data encryption technique of
PEM mail.

Now (and this is the fun part,) suppose I decide to bring pgp into compliance
with PEM (i.e., rfc1421-23), by following the appropriate  format for
delimeters, extra header fields, etc.

Are Public Key Partners then legally obligated to give me a license
to use RSA in my implementation, under their agreement with the Internet
Activities Board?  And if not, doesn't this mean that RFC1421-23 violate
RFC1310?  

Don't you just _love_ all this legal crap?  :-(

       Actually, NSA has been rather more open in recent years, now
that they have more need to justify their budget in the post
Cold War era.

      The NRO, the National Reconnisance Office, is also being a bit
more open.  They now admit they exist, and some of the issues surrounding
the spy satellite business are now openly discussed.  

      There's a question as to whether the NRO and the USAF have
succumbed to the problem that afflicts most recent aerospace programs:
the tendency to build in so much capability that the cost of the system
becomes so high that very few can be afforded.  This is the "B2 problem".
The US appears to have very good spy satellites, but not very many
of them, because they have grown so big they need a Shuttle launch
to put them in orbit.  It's a legitimate public policy question to
ask how well the NRO is being managed.  By now, everybody knows
we have spy satellites and roughly what they can do, so keeping the
whole organization secret is no longer justified.

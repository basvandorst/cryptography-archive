   Tut, tut, Vesselin. You know the difference between factoring primes and
   using the key generation algorithm to generate RSA keys.

   If you don't, then I despair of anything else you might say about mathema...
   er, arithmetic.    :-)

I can't speak for Vesselin but I, for one, do know how to
factorize primes.  I even have a fast constant time algorithm for
it.

	The 40-bit keys are too short to keep anyone but your officemate
out of your files.  It has noting to do with RC2 vs. any other system; the
problem is that 2^40 is only 10^12.  A brute-force keyspace search through
10^12 keys is quite feasible.  You have to expect that an adversary could
check something like 10^6 to 10^8 keys per processor-hour; with a fully
loaded CM-5 (which has something like 10^6 processor-hours/day) he could
check the entire keyspace in something like 15 minutes to a day.

	40 bits is just about the edge of feasibility of brute-force attacks
on "moderate" levels of current hardware.

	What, did you think that NSA's export restriction of 40 bits or less
was just for yuks?  ;-)

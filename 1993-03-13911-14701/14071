Description omitted...

A neat idea, but doesn't it throw away the usefulness of some of the
hardware (i.e. - only using 8 bits of the 24 that COULD be used)?  A
customer might not be too happy about this; (s)he didn't buy a spiffy
graphics card in order to only use 1/3 of it.

How about MY idea:

Use some PRNG to determine a set of pseudo-random positions in the
picture.

Use a SECOND PRNG to determine the direction of a bias that is to be
added.  (Suppose that it has the value 1 or -1).  Darken or lighten
each position by one "step."  (Hopefully there's a grey scale or
equivalent that has a lot more than 1 step.  16 steps might be ok; 256
steps would let a 1 step modification hide nicely.)

The +-1 bias will average out to zero, which means that the
modification does not change the character of the picture.

The question now is whether filtering techniques would be able to (by
context) throw away the bias.  I'd think that if the signature was
subtle enough (i.e. - the colour/shading adjustments were very
slight), filtering algorithms might just see it as noise.

I guess that what I'm thinking is that a signature might hide,
masquerading as a little bit of "noise."  If there is some REAL noise
involved, then it might be able to hide successfully.

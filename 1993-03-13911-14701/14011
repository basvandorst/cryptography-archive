Posted to sci.astro, sci.space, comp.org.eff.talk, sci.crypt and
alt.usage.english.  I've redirected followups to poster, which
means send me mail; if you really want to post a reply I suggest
sci.crypt as the group with the most relevance to traffic analysis,
though I'm not entirely happy with that choice.  Since there isn't
anything better though, I'd recommend mail.  I'll summarize once
I've analyzed the suggestions...

Certainly please don't follow up this article in sci.astro/space
or comp.org.eff.talk.

======================================================================

Anyone want to help play a new game?  'Spot the anon poster'!

Encouraged by the trivially easy identfication of an8729, I thought I'd
enlist your help in finding an8785 who started the flamefest in sci.space
and migrated to comp.org.eff.talk.  He has a distinctive style, but I don't
think the poster frequents any of the groups I read under his real name, so
I've nothing to compare against.  Does anybody recognise this man...

I've noted below the most common features of an8785's postings.  Although
a lot of these are common to all of us, in combination they are a
fingerprint that should identify the poster.

[alt.usage.english folks: the comments about grammar, punctuation etc
aren't criticisms; I'm pointing out where there are in general choices
of how to write something, and which choice this person has made.
Don't post saying 'there's nothing wrong with that'.  You're probably
right - it may be something *other people* consistently get wrong and
he gets right...]

Btw, some signs - such as short lines - may be a deliberate
stylistic deception to fool us (especially since he changes
average line length between postings).

By and large, the poster's spelling, vocabulary, grammar and punctuation
show him to be reasonably well educated, though not nearly as much so as
he thinks.  His use of sentence structure (reflected in how he abuses
commas to link clauses) is deplorable, and his deliberate pretention in
choice of vocabulary is most noticable.  Further, he talks almost
exclusively in cliche and metaphor... (By the way, I infer that the
poster is male from his studious use of non-sexist language...)

I think if anyone recognises this style after having it pointed out, it
should be trivial to compare this definitively with other postings by
any suggested author.

back on his thoughts.

Why should we assume that the search and siezure

were "unwarranted"?
     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Double quotes for "quotations" (that aren't really)
                    Question-mark outside quotes, in contrast to full stops.

Remember, we are about to see a shocking loss
^^^^^^^^^ common grammatical form:  "word, sentence..."

for the SS in the Steve Jackson case.  How
many times before has an entity sued and won
against the SS?

Now that we've seen that pseudonymous postings are not an
unmitigated evil by demonstrating their accountability and
responsibility, we need to go further and to *promote*
pseudonymous postings as a positive good.

The reason that they are to be encouraged is that the
pseudonymous article distance the ego of the poster

                               This happens again below.

                                                    canadian?)

the posting is divorced from defense of the self and
conversely, advocacy of a position is separated from
simple self-promotion.

  writing long sentences where semicolons would be appropriate. Note
  the way an independent clause is just tacked on the end with a comma.

        ^^^^^^^^^^^ Note, uses "she or he", not "he or she".

                    (Lots of signs of an obsessive personality in these
                    posts)

This does not mean arguments would become less passionate,
but the passion is redirected from a defense of a self-image
to the defense of a *position.*
                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ full-stops consistently *inside*
                                 punctuation, whether emphasis or quotation.


Thus the exhortation by *emotional pressure* or by
"pinpointing an enemy", which is by far and away the

   Note the use of a parenthetically elucidating clause between commas.

Anonymous postings demand a lot from the readership in

certainly increase as anonymous postings become the norm.

But for the rest of us, this difficult and frustrating process of
learning effective strategies of analysis and resolution is identical
with education in our free society, a society that is slowly

transcending national boundaries at the speed of light.

It's been six weeks now since I posted the original 
"Challenger" article to sci.space and sci.astro as a 
contribution to the on-going thread reminiscing on the

                             (both of which are wrong btw)

tragedy.  I am still surprised at the intensity of negative 
reaction that several posters had to the article and
by association to the concept of anonymous posting.

While the usual reader of those newsgroups may be far more 
comfortable with the inhuman aspects of space flight -- 
                    ^^^^^^^^^ knows lots of impressive words,
                              but more that once choses wrong one
                              in casual talk. (Should be 'impersonal')
metric tons of fuel, pseudoinverse trajectory calculation, 
torrs of Oxygen, kilos of payload -- I believe that the 
phenomenon of crewed space flight is far more interesting at 
the sharp human edge, the sharp edge that cuts a thin bead of

blood into the skin.

Looking at political issues of funding and priorities as well 
as the social consequences of space exploration, many of us 
                                                 ^^^^^^^^^^
believe that the human angle is far more important, but fluid 
^^^^^^^  feels qualified to speak on others' behalfs.

             unlikely over 40 (from the 'she or he' thing...).

a more interesting challenge to understand and integrate 
into the whole picture than the relatively more deterministic 
mechanical issues.

Sci.space and sci.astro need many more blunt posts centered 
on the human theme, even if strong medicine to many readers.
                          ^^^^ misses out verbs ('it is' in this case) a lot.

As far as anonymous postings in general, the threats of 
personal violence that the Challenger post unearthed, for me, 
more than confirmed my decision to use it.  The contrary 

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ despite apparent education,
   totally incapable of stringing more than two lines together to
   form a coherent sentence.

over 20,000 people now have used the Finnish anon service.  
     ^^^^^^ note the comma in large numbers.

The newsgroups have approximately the same mix of surplusage, 
                                                  ^^^^^^^^^^^ personal
                                                              coinage?

truth and tripe as they always have had.  The imminent death 
of the sci. and comp. groups seems a bit presumptuous.

I think it takes far more courage to post anonymously than to 
hide behind your affiliations.  For me, a poster who, 
although anonymously, slowly built a strong argument through 
a series of well-written anonymous posts and politely 
responded to counterexamples and the other stuff of a good 
debate, would capture my respect far more than Dick 
Reputable, Ph.D.@bigfoo.com making a simple pronouncement on 
           ^^^^^ Note ends *all* abbrevations with "."...
the whole matter that his net-flacks are expected to parrot.

   [aside: I wonder if he means himself when he says 'well-written'?
    -- and in a sentence like that! *ROFL*]

Yes, it takes more effort to get your mind around anonymous 
posts than attributed ones: we get out of the habit of 
                       ^^^^^^^ consistently uses single space after colon

evaluating arguments without the guiding badges and trappings 
of authority accompanying them.  Those posters who have 
forgotten how to legitimately persuade and, through time and 
              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  dares to split the classic infinitive!
                                        (see also 'to boldly take')

accreting rank, have relied upon the prestige of their 
posting site may well have reason to fear the new order of 
things.  But the content of the argument ought to be 
important for all posters, not just the ones who do not have

  ^^^^^^ gives some indication of background? (I've no idea what a Keogh
         plan is)

that the necessity of experimentation, systematic 
observation, and falsifiability supporting a scientific truth

The concept of anonymous posting is the next great step in

Yes, it has a great capacity to annoy and anger, but it has 
^^^^^ The old single-word introduction.  Distinctive writing trait.

an even greater capacity to engage the truth for those with 
courage enough to learn to use it universally and well.

===================================================================

I think that should be enough.  Any suggestions?

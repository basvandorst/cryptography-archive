   Even easier, with PGP 2.1 you can just use

	   pgp -f < cyphertext > plaintext

   The decrypted message will be saved in the file plaintext, even if it
   is marked "for your eyes only". I hope that this bug will be corrected
   in version 2.2.


Under PGP n.n, I can always decrypt my file on a terminal which
has an attached "printer" used for logging.  I can capture this
on another computer just as easily as I can print out a hardcopy.
The system console of our Unix boxes is generally a
vt220-emulator with a cheap dot-matrix printer giving us a
permanent record of error and status messages.

>>For that matter, anyone run across the algorithm description for
SHS/SHA?

The original FIPS proposals for the DSS and SHS appeared in the Federal
Register Aug.  30, 1991 and Jan.  31, 1992, respectively.  The
algorithms were completely described.  Newly revised DSA/SHA drafts were
released on Feb.  17, 1993 at the Federal Digital Signature Applications
Symposium and supposedly published in the Federal Register shortly
thereafter.

I'd first try to find these things on cs-bbs.nist.gov; I pretty sure
they are there.  A large public library should have the Federal Register
and NIST is usually willing to mail out free copies--try calling Barbara
Blickenstaff at 301 975-2816 (fax:  301 948-1784).

Hope that helps.  As far as the source code goes, you're on your own.

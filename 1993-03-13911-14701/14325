It was, as I recall, based on the fact that the source code is public.
Presumably, any package could fall under this. If I chose, say, to
publish the source code to my proprietary system and place it in the
library, it would presumably be considered public and fall under the
exemptions, which did not envision things that weren't trade secrets.

Incidently, this produces an interesting thought in my mind -- all
source code that you copyright is technically speaking available from
the copyright office (or at least part of it) even if you never sell
source licenses. Hmmm...

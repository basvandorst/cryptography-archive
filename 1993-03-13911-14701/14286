New question:  does anyone know of such an algorithm that is adapted for
mechanically shuffling an actual, physical deck of cards?  I was thinking
maybe of a machine with 52 slots that pneumatically sucks one card into
each, then spits them out in the right order (and in that case one algorithm
is as good as another) but if someone can think of an algorithm in which
the "swaps" or whatever would correspond physically to manipulations of
cards in a way less expensive to realize, so much the better.

The algorithm and device should be designed to give no information about
the permutation chosen, either by the sounds emitted by the machine or
by how long it runs.

And perhaps most importantly:  Does anyone know of any existing commercial
realization of this concept?  It's been a dream of mine for a long time;
conventional shuffling, as I suppose most know by now, is not really that
great unless you do it at least 7 times, and I wonder if even then the
distribution of extreme things like 10-card suits (in a hand of 13 cards)
is right.

I know this is a little off the track of sci.crypt, which I don't usually
read anyway, so e-mail responses would be ideal.

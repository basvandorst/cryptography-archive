Intellectual dishonesty is the right term for Dr. Denning's
failure to address technical objections.  You can excuse her
on the basis of "she doesn't share your reverence for civil rights"
or "she believes in the goodness of government", and this is
indeed a matter of taste.

However, many objections to the technological basis of registered
keys were raised on this net.  I leave them to the original
posters to repeat.

My objection is one of social technology, which I believe absolutely
invalidates the idea of a registered key.  Namely, you have to have
draconian punishment for registering one key and using another,
which can't be detected until the gov gets a key-tap warrant
and finds it can
t decode anything.  At that point, a killer/terrorist/drug lord
(Pick your favorite bogeyman) must be faced with a worse fate
for using an illegal key than the primary crime.

So, are we going to enforce this against every smart-ass kid and
husband cheating on his wife?  Dr. Denning passes this problem 
off in her article as "The government shouldn't put much enforcement
effort into detecting illegal use of keys, but should reserve the
law for serious lawbreakers." (I am paraphrasing here.)

So, if we are all good, the gov wont' have the excuse to execute
us for illegal use of a key.  I don't think this is social tehnology
which works.  I don't think it is a matter of opinion whether
it CAN work, because the examples of drugs, alcohol, guns,
prostitution, ... argue against draconian punishments being ever
imposed for non-capital crimes in a democratic society, and the
government cannot differentially prosecute a capital offense.

It is not intellectually honest to gloss over major, serious,
objections which defeat the entire idea of public key registrtion.

If you don't think my argument does so, go back and read the thread
of 6 months ago and look at the cryptologic analysis which did so.
She did not address these issues either.

But she did not fail in that regard!  Her article was careful to enumerate
the technical objections.  None of the responses covered new technical
ground, at least that I could determine.

Since 25% of her paper is about cryptography,
a subject which the digital telephony proposal *does not address*,
I cannot see how this is a "gloss over".
There are plenty of technical issues, why bother with those of character?

I thought Ron Rivest's response was excellent,
but was so non-confrontational that its message may have been lost.
A confrontational paraphrase (my opinion) would be
"This legislation will cripple our communications future,
and on top of that is so invasive that Americans will reject
it out of hand".
Of course this simple message must be backed by substantive arguments.
Rivest and others have provided several.
One of Denning's counter-arguments, that tapping would "require industry
to use technology to make networks smarter", is particularly weak.
It seems to be confusing high-tech tapping with high-tech communication.

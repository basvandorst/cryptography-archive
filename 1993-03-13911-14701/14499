Sorry, won't work.  There is a world of difference between a work that
is protected by registered copyright and a work in the public domain.

Public domain means freely available to anyone for no charge to do with
whatever they wish with no attribution or obligation to anyone including
the author.

Copyright is the establishment of control by the author so the work is
NOT freely available to anyone...etc.

If Zimmerman wants PGP to be public domain, he must explicitly abandon
the copyright.  THEN one could argue s/w such as PGP is exempt from ITARs
via the public domain rules.

Listening Phil?

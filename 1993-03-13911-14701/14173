Is encryption legal?  Where do I get PGP for my Atari ST?  Is true privacy
technologically possible on the Internet?  Can users computing in totalitarian
countries use the Internet to organize themselves for the purpose of
promoting democracy?

What sources are available for answering these and similar questions?

1)  Usenet newsgroups?

2)  email mailing lists?

3)  electronic publications?

4)  books?

5)  magazines?

6)  anonymous posting services?

7)  encryption software?

8)  FAQs?

9)  online services roundtables?

10) BBSs?

Please send references and citations to ksjwr@acad1.alaska.edu.  I am
especially interested in newsgroups to which I can cross post this
message.

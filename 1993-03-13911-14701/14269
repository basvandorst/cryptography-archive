Biometrics scare me.  I see more and more of those boxes at doorways
where you put your hand in a box, and it opens the door if your
fingers are the right length.  I wonder how many people will be
dismembered by muggers (hands cut off so the mugger can operate the
box) before the boxes become unpopular.  I haven't heard of this
actually happening yet though.

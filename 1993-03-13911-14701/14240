Yes, all of that is true.  I suppose I should have stated some underlying
assumptions:

 - The algorithm is unbroken.

 - Everyone has managed to keep their private key to themselves.

 - Everyone certifies keys using some certification authority, or another
   method everyone agrees will work.

In other words, if the system is working as intended (and was properly designed
in the first place), verification of the digital signature verifies who the
sender of the message was.

I have no argument with the list of potential problems listed by Christopher
Owens.  They're all very real concerns, and anyone implementing a public key
system would be well advised to consider them carefully.

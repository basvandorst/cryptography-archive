Exactly.  And very valuable.  Picture yourself as a Playboy executive
planning on setting up an electronic bulleting board to distribute
your pictures to horny young computer nerds accross America.  You know
that you need something like this.

It's the latter.

Yeah.  So far, the best idea I've been given is to make a small
alteration in the picture like moving a strand of hair.  Of course the
software to do this automatically in a million different ways so that
each customer can have his own little signature would be impossible to
write with current technology.

Yeah, but the key issue is to figure out who let people copy that
photograph.  Looking at the Playboy example again, Playboy doesn't
want to sue a million adolescent picture pirates who download pictures
from anonymous FTP sites.  They want to get whoever posted the picture
in the first place.

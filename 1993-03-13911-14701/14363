David denies that this is an ad hominem attack.  David, an ad hominem
attack is an attack in which, rather than answering the *contents* of
the messages, you seek to discredit the person who posts it.

This is not to say that some posters haven't discredited themselves to
the extent that an ad hominem dismissal of what they have to say is
appropriate.

I think you'll find that both Perry Metzger and Graham Toal command a
great deal more respect in this newsgroup than you do.  Both of them,
for example, have sufficient grasp of basic arithmetic not to suggest
your ludicrous scheme for crackiing RSA.

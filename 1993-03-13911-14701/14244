[ I didn't mean to come across as critical of Todd here;  I just think
  that presentation of the idea should always be accompanied by a
  discussion of known attack modes and vulnerabilities.  The PGP and
  RIPEM documentation is exemplary in this regard.  This is
  especiallly important in the current context of discussion: the
  Taurus system in particular, and, in general the selling of
  technology to the commercial customer.  As producers of that
  technology we owe it to ourselves and to our consumers, many of whom
  do not really understand data security issues, to be scrupulously
  precise in our claims as to what the technology can and can't
  deliver.]

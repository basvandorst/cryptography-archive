Errr,
listening to a tape, even in stereo, of a person talking in a noisy
enviriroment is FAR harder to do than listening in person.  Ask an
acoustics engineer/ENT MD or other guru, but the fact is, the
reproduction is never 100% perfect, and without that, your brain can't
use all the data it would get in person.

For example, coughs at a concert are disturbing, but if they are
on a recording, they destroy it........

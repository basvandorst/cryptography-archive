Diskreet offers two ciphers, DES and a fast proprietary cipher.  I assume
you used DES since you refer to CBC mode.

I took a look at diskreet's proprietary encryption.  I didn't dis-assemble
the code, but I did encrypt an all 0 file with a six character password, the 
shortest allowed.  The ciphertext was definitely not random. 

I decided not to use it, and that was the extent of my investigation.
If anyone is looking for a high-profile cipher to break, Diskreet's
proprietary encryption should be a reasonable target.

If anyone knows the exact algorithm used (or a reference) I'd like to
hear about it.

Also, there was recently a post about Lotus Notes, which uses the RSA.
A Lotus salesman told me it uses a proprietary algorithm for conventional
encryption, and I assume RSA is used to establish a session key.  
Does anyone know about this cipher, or what kind of hash Notes uses ?

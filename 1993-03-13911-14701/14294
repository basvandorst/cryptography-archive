Well, I went down to my library and actually read her article (and, also
the articles that accompany them).

Steve basically has it right.  I went to a security conference maybe 10 years
ago, sponsored by the National Institute of Standards all having to do with the
trusted computing standard that was emerging at the time.  Dorothy was on one
of the panels or talking on her own, I forget which.  I recall she spoke well.

But, she has clearly identified her interest with the Government for some time,
near as I can tell.  Perhaps one's friends _do_ bias one's viewpoint, after all.

I find her faith in the good offices of the FBI in a matter like this
extremely amazing for someone as educated as herself.  Makes me wonder where
she was while Watergate was going on.

Perhaps if someone could clue her in that the problem is not with the
current FBI agents, but with who their bosses may someday be, she might 
have a little more balance on the issue.  In 1968, when the wiretap bill was
passed, no one thought Nixon was capable of what he actually turned out to do.
I'll be that bill would not have been passed in '73 or '74.  I wonder if it
could get through if it had to start over.  Some of us still remember that
the Watergate coverup was not to protect Liddy and the Cubans so much as to
cover up the relatively large amount of bag jobs and illegal cash floating
around the White House.  Imagine what a techno-bright group could do with
DD's/FBI's infrastructure.

Whether she knows it or not, she's advocating the infrastructure for a
totalitarian state.  For me, I'd rather a few more drug dealers and Mafioso.

In the meantime, I suggest that instead of making another flame-war out of it,
we all sit down and write a reasoned letter to CACM, which will have a much
more positive effect.  It would help for the ACM to see _numbers_ of
professionals who think that DD's proposals (and, the FBI's for that matter)
are not supported by the professionals generally.

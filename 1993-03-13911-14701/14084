	I think this a good point in light of the issue of
intelligence agencies which are looking for a new 'job'.  (e.g.
Should the CIA keep American companies safe from electronic espionage,
by spying on foreign companies?)  An increase in local security and
transmissions may make it harder for NSA to track people and
information down, but hopefully it would do the same for foreign agencies.
	Of course, most information isn't grabbed off a phone line, or
network, but is sold by people who have access to that information,
and it's keys.  These people could then use the new widespread
security techniques to transmit their stolen information without fear
of the information being intercepted and deciphered.
	So, is the security of the nation better provided by the open
transmission of information by which an elitist institution (that soon
may not be able to cope with the amount of heavy information being
transmitted) 'watches' over, or localized and secure transmissions.

Summary: Book on WWII Navajo code talkers

Hello,

I ran across a book that provides some insight into the Navajo code talkers
that were mentioned here recently.  I did not buy the book, only read a 
commentary.  It said this book was great for young readers (ages 10 and up).
(Hmmmm, I guess I fit that catagory )   : )

An excerpt,
"On the Pacific front during WWII, strange messages were picked up by American
and Japanese forces on land and sea.  The messages were totally unintelligible
to most
American troops.  Were they in some strange Japanese code?  Yet the messages
were
also unintelligible to the Japanese.  Only a special group of American troops
understood
the messages: the Navajo code talkers, a group of Navajos communicating in a
code based
on the Navajo language.  The code, developed fron the complex Navajo language,
proved
to be unbreakable: no one but a Navajo member of the U. S. Marine Corps could
send or
receive these messages, which depended heavily on tone and inflection.  The
code talkers participated in key battles and maneuvers: Saipan, Guadalcanal,
and Iwo Jima".
It continues with  comments about the author and how the background information
is
particularly effective.  Sounds like interesting reading.

Summary: Fairly new journal of article abstracts
X-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL8]

Yesterday I received (unsolicited, as far as I can recall) a copy
of "Computer and Communications Security Reviews".  This is a
quarterly publication that contains very short abstracts 
(usually 4 lines) of security-related articles in other 
publications.  There are lengthy sections devoted to various
aspects of cryptology.  (I.e., this is not just an anti-virus
publication.)

A year's subscription costs $95 US, or 60 British pounds.
VISA and Mastercard are accepted.

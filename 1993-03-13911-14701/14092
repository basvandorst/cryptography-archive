I would appreciate any info, pointers on good algorithms for encrypting
passwords.  The algorithm can (should) be one-way, as the plaintext won't
be needed after entry.

Please e-mail, unless you think that what you have to say would be of
general interest.

I am working in a prioprietary language, so C code isn't particularly
helpful.  Just a detailed description of the algorithm would be most 
useful.  Thanks for your help/time!

As I remember the story, Navaho was used for *tactical* communications
between ships by the Navy in the Pacfic in WWII.  

It would have had a number of real advantages.  Speaking in 'the clear'
would have been much faster with greater volume... real important in
tactical communications.  Even if the traffic was recorded and later
'deciphered', the time lag would have made the information relatively
useless to the enemy.

BTW, I assume this is one of the problems the NSA has right now. "Deciphering"
natural language requires a speaker of that language.  Real-time availability
of translations would be difficult if the traffic volume was high.  And
for tactical information, real-time is where it's at.

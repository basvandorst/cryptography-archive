This was true during WWII, but not any more.  Navajo has a written form today;
the University of New Mexico offers classes in Navajo.

I don't know if the effects were all that substantial.  The Code Talkers were
a volunteers-only unit within the Marine Corps, which was itself (I believe)
volunteer-based even during WWII.  The Navajos are now the most populous
tribe in the US, with around 100,000 members.

Not a fool.  Just unrealistic.

This requires human intervention.  That makes it expensive.  The whole
idea is to be able to do this cheaply.  That means automatically.

Also, how do you define which features are unimportant?  That little
road you add may be unimportant to 99.9% of users, but the guy who is
trying to navigate in that area may have a real problem.  Telling
publishers of scientific information that you intend to alter the
pictures they have in their journals is likely to cause concern.
Telling an art publisher that you intend to alter the Mona Lisa is
likely to cause heart palpitations.

Because it is expensive, time consuming, and politically impossible in
many important cases.

:Sorry, won't work.  There is a world of difference between a work that

Ah, but if you read the actual wording of the ITAR (that was posted here
recently), it goes on to define what *it* means by 'in the public domain',
and it clearly means 'not secret' as opposed to the more narrow definition
used in copyright law.  Remember, this is a document about government
secrecy, not copyright.

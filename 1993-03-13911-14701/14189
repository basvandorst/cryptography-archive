   someone asked a question something like this:

   with the talks of federal agencies raiding politically incorrect organizations
   and seizing hard drives, I was wondering if anyone was considering writing
   a 'stacker' like utility for encrypting your entire drive?

	   The operation might be in the form of individual sensitive files
   and decrypting at run time. This would make the disk "seizure-proof". Maybe
   pgp would not be the "ideal" method, but it might be done...? Any gurus wanna
   give it a quick try? Not too sure how that would work.

Norton Utilities already has a program for this (called "diskreet")
for MSDOS, although it's not free.  It would be a nice hack for
someone to write a comparable free program, perhaps using some of the
PGP cryptography routines; but note that it would be quite system
dependent.

Most of the interesting parts of PGP are in its key management and
public key cryptography features, none of which would be relevant to
an encrypted file system.  You'd want to use straight conventional
cryptography for this.

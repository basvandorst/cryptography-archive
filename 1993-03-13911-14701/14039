Security Stndards, HELP!

I would appreciate any help from someone that can provide insight to the 
speed characteristics of each of the following:

Data Encryption Standard,  Public Key (RSA, Diffie-Hellman), and 
Digital Signature Algorithm

as currently viewed by the NSIT and their adoption of a standard.

I am currently working on my thesis over these three algorithms, and am
looking for comparative time rates for each.  So far all I could find was
that DES is fastest, followed by RSA, and then Digital Signature.  But at
what rates?


Thanks for your help,

David Williams.

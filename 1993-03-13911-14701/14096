I'm quite certain that Navajo speakers _were_ employed to provide a
cryptosystem during World War II.  I have seen and heard enough
interviews with these guys to believe it.  They continue to have
periodic reunions, apparently.

As to the success of the program, I have no information.  All I've ever
heard on the subject made it sound as if it was 100% successful, but
who knows?  I'm sure we'll hear about this from the folks with the
research materials...

"Reasonably" is the operative word here.  Somewhere I've got a large table
of results for one of these dice done by some guy who rolled hundreds or
even thousands of values on one to see how random it really was.  It wasn't
terribly random - it was too hard to get a 100-sided polygon perfectly
regular.  In fact even normal dice can be doctored by filing the edges or
weighting them (I've got several loaded d6 which always roll either high or
low).  If an attacker can get hold of the dice you used they can reconstruct
any statistical irregularities and use them as the basis for an attack on
your random numbers.

BTW in my random collection I've also got a d6 which is marked in powers of 2
from 2 to 64 - no idea what it's used for though.

Peter.

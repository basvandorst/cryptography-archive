I am looking for a way to have N people share a secret (such as a key) in
such a way that any predefined subset of those N people could get together
and produce the key shared among the entire group.  For example, 8 people
have pieces and 5 are needed to build the entire key, but it can be any 5
of the 8.  I thought I had seen a reference to something like this in this
group a while back but I apparently didn't save it.

If it is possible and/or people know any references for me I would
appreciate hearing about them...

Thanks,
jim

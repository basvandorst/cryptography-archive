In practice, however, it is not that trivial at all. There are
automatic methods that are able to detect the language a text is
written in, if it is indeed written in some language. The task to
determine whether it is indeed English or just gibberish is much more
difficult. It is possible to sieve out a lot of stuff, but I don't
know how the complete decision can be fully automated as to not
require human inspection...

No, a huge amount of messages will still be gibberish and yet have the
same (or similar) letter frequency... 2^56 is a lot of potential
messages...

In single DES the key is 56 bits long.

Actually, the letter frequency is very helpful to break the message
exactly in those cases, especially with simple substitution cyphers.

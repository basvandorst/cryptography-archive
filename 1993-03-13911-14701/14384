   A relative newbie wants to know:
   What, in the sci.crypt readers' opinions, are the best resources to start
   learning about public key encryption?  I've tried looking at the Eurocrypt
   submissions, but quickly learned they were WAY over my head.  If anyone has
   any suggestions, please let me know.

Well, in spite of all the heat Dorothy Denning has taken for some of
her proposals about the trustability of governments,
she *does* know what she's talking about technically, and her book
on cryptography and data security (from about 10 years ago) is pretty good.
You can also look at the FAQ on rsa.com

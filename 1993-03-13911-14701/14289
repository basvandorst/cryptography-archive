        And the Notes administrator, system operator, their boss, your
        boss, a hundred people at Lotus, Jim Bidzos, your NOS vendor
        rep, the backup site manager, his friend at NASA Ames, all
        have access to your private key, helpfully generated and
        stored for you by Notes.

        I think I'll do my own encryption anyway.

        Cheers,
                Marc

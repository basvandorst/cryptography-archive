However, if a simple transformation is done on the text to grable it
prior to sending to to DES, this should greatly complicate the task of
determining if the encryption has been broken.  Thus, even XORing each
character with a constant value yeilds data which for character
frequency and dictionary searches does not resemble English.
(Granted, this example can be trivially cryptoanalized,  but using DES
and some simple (unknown) transformation will greatly complicate the
cracjking process.  Does anyone know how the codebreakers can solve
this problem,  or the more general one of an unknown encryption algorithm.

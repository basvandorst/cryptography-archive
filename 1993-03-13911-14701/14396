   Some people have raised the question of whether the compression used in
   PGP will produce some known plaintext at the beginning of the message.
   This is an important concern, and it should be raised.

   I considered that in the design of PGP.  PGP uses cipher feedback mode
   with a random initialization vector at the beginning of the file.
   This random material has the effect of disrupting the known plaintext
   pattern that follows it.  Because of this technique, I think PGP avoids
   the known plaintext problem.

While it certainly helps the situation, it's still possible to
validate whether a decryption is correct by decrypting the first few
blocks of the file - after you get past the random initialization,
you can see if the 3 bytes of known plaintext are there,
and if they are it's a strong chance your key guess was correct,
which lets you do further checking in only 2**-24 of the cases.
But 128-bit long randomly-chosen session keys for IDEA makes
key-guessing fairly non-productive, unless you're checking whether the
key you stole from someone was correct...

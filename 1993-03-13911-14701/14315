The problem is, it isn't enough to just say, "potentially."  Potentially,
DES can be broken.  But in many cases the cost to do so would be more than
the value of the data, or the data would no longer be worthwhile by the
time it was cracked.  The relative costs are known, so informed decisions
can be made.  Often DES is chosen to protect data.

Do you have any information on the odds of recovering data that has been
overwritten n times, for various n, so that similar informed decisions
could be made?  To simply say that one must assume that it can be done is
like saying that one must assume a cipher can be broken, and therefore
nothing other than a one-time-pad must ever be used.

Specifically, what about the "government" wiping done by Norton Utilities'
WipeFile, which as I recall overwrites with zeros, then ones, repeating
three times, and then with 0xf6's.

This is simply an error detection / error correction problem.
Basically, if you are trying to detect which subset of size n of your
customers is colluding to defraud you, you are devising an error
correction code to detect (correct?) n bits of error.  It is solvable,
if you really need to do it.

Practically speaking, your news items are going to sound as if they
were written by a school-kid with a thesaurus.  Good luck selling them.

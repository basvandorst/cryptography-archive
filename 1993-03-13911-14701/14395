   Intellectual dishonesty is the right term for Dr. Denning's
   failure to address technical objections.  You can excuse her
   on the basis of "she doesn't share your reverence for civil rights"
   [...] It is not intellectually honest to gloss over major, serious,
   objections which defeat the entire idea of public key registrtion.

I think, at least on the netnews discussion, that she did better than
gloss over the serious *technical* problems - but they real serious problems
are *values* problems and people problems, where she's clearly wrong,
or at least, um, "significantly challenged".
Some of them affect workability - can you keep the amount of bribery
and other leakage by goverment officials down to a "manageable" level,
can you stop users like me from registering 2**32 keys without doing
something that creates a legally challengable case, etc.
But she did pretty well about addressing technical issues while being flambeed
about the purposes of her proposal...

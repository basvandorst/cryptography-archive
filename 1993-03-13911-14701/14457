I really enjoyed the reset of this post but this part puzzles me.  On the
one hand, you seem to support the right of citizens to use encryption to
ensure private communications especially to help the efforts of budding
"good" groups.  Then on the other hand, it seems that you are in some way
advocating denying the use of cryptography to "bad" groups.

I this an accurate assessment?  If so, I think you are misguided.  The
definition of "good" and "bad" are very dependent on ones viewpoint.  If
we deny basic freedoms to groups which are considered "bad" based on the
majority opinion, then the freedom af all citizens is at stake.  One never
knows when the "good" group to which one belongs will become "bad" in the
eyes of the majority.

If I've misunderstood your meaning, then I retract the above criticism as
applying to you.

   bill, do you mean public-domain (like pathalias) or copyright
   but freely available (like pgp)?  do you think the exemption 
   extends to copyleft?

Looks like either one works, but ....

There was a long flamewar about 1.5 years ago, and I didn't save everything,
and there may be further complications from some 1991 laws (written in
response to the discovery that Iraq had modern telephone switches and TCP/IP)
but here's what I could dig up from the material I'd saved:
1) I don't seem to have any articles actually posted by John, just some about
	things he said, so this is "hearsay squared", as somebody said
	about something else in this discussion (sorry, John)
2) There may be a file pub/doc/security/cryptreg.Z on nic.funet.fi,
	though anon-ftp is too busy to talk to me right now.
	Some archies know about this file, others don't, and archie.funet.fi
	says it's also on relay.cs.toronto.edu but I couldn't find it there.
	Obviously there's a Conspiracy here :-)
3) From the excerpts I could find, it looks like the definition of
	"public domain" here is different from the copyright-law definition;
	it may include stuff published and available for sale to the
	general public or at public libraries.
4) There's a complex set of rules about what's software, what's
	"technical data", whether the decisions are controlled by the
	NSA or Commerce or State Departments (though the President has
	the authority to change that if he wants), etc.
	Each bureaucracy says they're in charge - where's Al Haig these days?:-)
5) There was a good article in the Cornell International Law Journal in 1984
	which takes the case that the laws may be unconstitutional anyway.

==== Albert Langer's quotes from ITAR
 
I have looked up the 1990 edition of the U.S. Code of Federal 
Regulations, Title 22 which includes sub-chapter M, "International
Traffic in Arms Regulations" of Chapter 1 ("Department of State").
 
The relevant ITAR sections are as follows:
 
120.18  
      "Public domain" means information which is published and which
    is generally accessible to the public:
      (a) Through sales at newstands and bookstores;
      (b) Through subscriptions which are available without restriction
    to any individual who desires to obtain or purchase the published
    information;
      (c) Through second class mailing privileges granted by the U.S.
    Government; or,
      (d) At libraries open to the public.
 
125.1
(a) The export controls of this part apply to the export of technical
    data . . . . Information which is in the "public domain" (see
    section 120.18) is not subject to the controls of this sub-chapter.

======= Albert Langer's comment
 
Note that the definition of "public domain" for ITAR purposes is different
from that for copyright purposes and narrower than the Department of
Commerce definition of "generally available". However it obviously poses
no difficulties for anyone wishing to develop freely available software
including cryptographic techniques. If making it available for ftp and
ftp mailserver request does not itself count under (b) "...subscriptions
which are available without restriction to any individual..." then
making sure that libraries open to the public have copies available
would be sufficient under (d).

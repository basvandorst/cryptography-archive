North British Loco 224 was salvaged in April of the following year. It
took three attempts to get her to shore, so she actually sank into the
Tay three times !  She was then run on her own wheels to Glasgow for
repair (showing the lack of damage). She was moved to work East Coast
expresses for many years, and did not cross the Tay again until 28 Dec
1908, the 29th anniversary of the disaster, when she hauled the same
down night mail as on the night. She was scrapped in 1919.

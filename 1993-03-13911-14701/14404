That was understood, yes.  But thinking about it, *are* all the codes
in a compressed file evenly distributed?  What about the 'clear table'
code?  Won't it be underrepresented?  I guess a suitable detector chip
would signal a hit if it found even only one character from the alphabet,
if that one was *way* outside the normal distribution?

Assign each document and each customer a large prime number.  Generate
an encryption key by multiplying a document prime with a customer
prime, modulo 2^N where N bits are needed in the key.  Use some
standard encryption algorithm (e.g., IDEA or DES).

Combine all keys for a given document/customer set into a single file,
encrypt the file with some secret key, give the secret key to your
trustee, and include the file on the distribution medium.

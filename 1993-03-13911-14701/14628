I recently posted a request for documentation regarding government suppression
of strong crypto techniques.  I got quite a few responses (for which I am
grateful) but did not receive any references to this.  What do you mean by
"strongly frowns" above?  Are we talking criminal prosecution?  Can anyone
else back this statement up?

It seems to me that, since the use of DES is so widespread, the NSA would
realize that people will do with it what they please and wouldn't even
expend the effort required to frown upon it.

Why do you believe this? The answer to your question is no. It really
doesn't help very much to know that a prime is (for example) 256 bits
long. There are simply too many such primes. Suppose I gave you a
512-bit number and told you that was the product of two  256-bit primes.
This info will not help one bit in factoring the number [unless I were
a fool and made them TOO close together, e.g. their difference was
say less than 10^15; then a difference of squares method will factor the
number)

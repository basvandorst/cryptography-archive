In an earlier followup, I gave the wrong reference for an article on
copyrighting software.  The article is NOT in Dr. Dobbs' Journal.  It
is in the March 1993 issue of Computer Language.  The article is "How
to Copyright Software" by Mitchell White.

My apologies to anyone I inadvertently led on a wild goose chase...

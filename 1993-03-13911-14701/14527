I'm not sure where to post this, so I'll try here. Pointers to a better
group if there is one, please

What's the state of the art on non-cooperative speaker authentication?

I have in mind, for example, a device that will produce an index number for
speech on a phone that would be constant for a particular speaker. One could
use it to determine that number at a time that one is sure of the speaker,
building a data base of such numbers. When someone purporting to be a
particular person calls in future, one could check the index number against
the data base for verification.

"Non-cooperative" eliminates approaches such as public key encryption of the
date and time with the speaker's private key, and in any case would require
an artificiality during the conversation.

Thanks;

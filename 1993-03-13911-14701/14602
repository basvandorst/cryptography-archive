   This was true during WWII, but not any more.  Navajo has a written
   form today; the University of New Mexico offers classes in Navajo.

navajo may now have a written form, but it is still not a language
that you could just 'learn from a book'.  in fact, most people on this
planet over the age of 10 would have severe difficulties learning to
speak reasonable navajo due to phonetic differences.  to learn it well
enough in a short time to spoof a navajo would be virtually
impossible.  (to learn it well enough to understand would be a
different but still difficult proposition).

I've been thinking about this ever since PGP was released.
The data security that PGP can offer is seriously compromised
if you cannot maintain total physical security of your PC.
This is valid even if you keep all sensitive files encrypted
(for example with pgp -c). 

The problem with using PGP, even on a personal computer,
is that you don't have much control of what gets written to
the hard drive or not. Paging, for instance, may cause plaintext
to be written to disk, even if PGP takes measures to erase
the plaintext files. All in all, one must assume that sensitive
information will at some time be written to the hard drive.

Simply erasing the data (with a utility like Norton WipeInfo)
will not suffice, because everything that gets written on a
hard drive may potentially be restored at some later point.
(The Norwegian company IBAS is reportedly able to do this.)
The only way to erase data with 100% certainty is to melt the
platters.

It seems like the solution would be to encrypt _everything_
that ever gets written to the disk. Ideally, this should be
done in the disk controller, for speed reasons. A hardware
solution, however, would deter many people from obtaining
this level of security.

The answer, then, is to implement it in software on a low
level, i.e. in or near the disk device driver where the
individual sector requests (WRITE_SECTOR, READ_SECTOR) may
be intercepted and encrypted/decrypted.

This is clearly an all or nothing solution; when you have
booted the PC and typed the pass phrase, everything will be
available. But when the PC is turned off it will be truly
seizure-proof (provided that the encryption algorithm is
strong and it is applied in a secure manner).

Am I a fool or what ? (Yes, I know...)
I thought #1 is solveable, if you do not use 'bits' to tag the picture,
but some features of the picture, that include a larger area. 
(Like these little roads mappers place, or some added freckles to a face,
or the flower to the vase) So please tell me why you can not use this
kind of variation. It is not as cheap as 'bit-tagging' because it requires
human intervention to generate a set of possible changes to a picture;
bit it should work. (And was proposed here at least 3 times)

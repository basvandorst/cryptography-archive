this is kind of a bit off this group, but it seems like the sort of thing
people here might have some knowledge about...

Just about all electronic equipment also acts as a transmitter of some
sort.  This gets particularly interesting with radio receivers (tv too),
which do quite a good job of broadcasting signals.

(In England, for example, the beeb (?BEEB?) used to have "telly wagons"
whiich would park outside a building and "listen" for the transmissions
from any unlicensed, ie non-fee paying, tv sets. )

So my question: How detectable are these signals? Could, for example, a
well equipped military unit detect the "walkman" being used by some enemy
soldiers?  If so, how far would this type of signal be detectable?

In a related consumer issue, at least one police department has been
experimenting with "radar detector detectors" which brings up all sorts of
other legal type questions as well.

thanks

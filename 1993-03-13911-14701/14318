I'm not convinced about this -- I don't see a good statistical attack on
the combined 2-book running key with a single ciphertext.  Granted some
spaces will line up quite often, and spaces and e's will line up with each
other, but I don't see that this kind of thing gives enough local
information to break in anywhere.

I'll try the "argument from authority":  In "Military Cryptanalysis Part
III" by William F. Friedman (Aegean Park Press #60, page 71), he says
"But now suppose that the key text that has actually been employed is not
intelligible text.  The process is still somewhat the same, only in this
case one must have at least two messages in the same key." Accepting this
as gospel, the only question left is whether the key text is "intelligible".
We could do a 2- or 3-text challenge cipher on this, if you want to prove
your assertion dramatically.

The point that I was trying to make earlier is that even if all 10^8 or
so books in your library are completely filled with absolutely physically
random numbers uniformly distributed in the range 0-255, a combination of
running keys from N of them doesn't give you provable safety like a Vernam
encryption does -- there just aren't enough starting places... i.e. the
key space is much smaller than the message space.

All of this is worse than DES, of course, because two messages encrypted
with the same key will expose both, for any number of keytexts.

48 rounds with the same 56-bit key?  Why?  Shamir showed that with
a 56-bit key, having more than 16 rounds adds no security.  And just 
using a larger key adds nothing, as the S-boxes have only ~56 bits of 
information.

I think to "extend" DES you would need to widen all the bus (word) 
widths and generate new, larger, S-boxes.  Then more rounds would
make sense.

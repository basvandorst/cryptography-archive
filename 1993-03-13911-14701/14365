Not to be paranoid or anything, but this isn't true.  It's quite
feasible to encode information without it being readily visible.
For example, the spacing of the characters, their size, etc., all
could be indicators of additional information.  So I would agree
that there does not *appear* to be hidden information, but that's
not to say that there *is no* hidden information.

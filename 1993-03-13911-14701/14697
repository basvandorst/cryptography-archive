Ok, their exists a P(n) that always produces unique primes.  (Sorry it took
me so long, Bob :-) ) 

Assuming that a transformation involving P(n) produces a suitable RSA key for
an arbritrary key x, can this transformation be used to significantly improve
RSA.

Again, this idea comes from the apparent discrepancy between the claims I have
heard that 384 bit RSA is breakable, whereas 56 bit DES is not, the reason beingthat any bit sequence can be valid with DES, but not RSA.  Does allowing 
arbitrary keys like this improve security in any way?

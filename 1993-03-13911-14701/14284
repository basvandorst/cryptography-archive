I am in search of software which encrypts not only files but whole
harddisks / partitions / logical drives.

Of course the encryption doesn't need to be real time. It definitely
must be able to handle large drives however, 32 MB is not enough.

The software should be OS/2- or DOS-based or, if not so, have its
source code included so one can alter it to fit one's needs.

If anybody knows of such software, please post or e-mail the
information or - if you are a VERY kind soul - e-mail the software
to me directly. My address is
   wolft@informatik.tu-muenchen.de

Thank you very much for your time!

  As I understand it, the argument in favor of key registration is that it
allegedly strikes a reasonable balance between:

  1.  The privacy of users, and

  2.  The government's need to read the traffic of criminals such as drug
        dealers, terrorists, etc.

  Meanwhile, back in the real world, such a scheme strikes a blanace between:

  1.  The privacy of users, and

  2.  The government's need to read the traffic of persons who disregard the
        laws against drug dealing, terrorism, etc. but scrupulously obey the
        (hypothetical) laws requiring key registration.

  I suppose the government could expend resources to defend us against that
peculiar selectively-criminal element.  It could also expend resources to
defend us against attack by the creatures who are holding Elvis Presley's
brain hostage on the Planet Zort.  In each case, I don't think the government
would ever encounter any of the threats it was defending us against....

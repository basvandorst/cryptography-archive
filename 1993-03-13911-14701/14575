There is another algorithm, due to David E. Ferguson, that simply produces
primes directly from a random seed. I will try to dig it up. I don't know
where it was published (I'm sure it was submitted for publication somewhere),
but David E. Ferguson had an article in CACM June or July of last year on
bit tree searching. That article might provide leads to his prime generator.

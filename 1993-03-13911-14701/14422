This is the purpose of Shannon's Unicity Distance. (from his Bell Tech Journal
article in the 1940s)

If you know a system with a key of K bits and you have soem ciphertext of M
bits which decrypts to a plaintext of N characters, using some key you've
concocted (or derived by cryptanalysis), what is the chance that you've
arrived at only one of many possible solutions?

It turns out that there is an implicit entropy (information content) of
the characters of plaintext.  For English it's about 1 bit per character.
Call this value e.

If

	M >> K + e*N

and you can demonstrate to an impartial observer how to derive the
plaintext from the ciphertext, using your chosen key, then it is extremely
unlikely that there is a second solution to the ciphertext.

If, on the other hand,  M << K + e*N, as is the case with a true one time pad,
then you are assured that there are many other solutions.

I don't know the formulae for probability of a second solution as a
function of M, K, e and N but I'm sure it has been derived.  I'd start with
Shannon's paper and then I would turn to Kullbach's "Information Theory and
Statistics".  Failing those, I'd derive it myself from a probability text.

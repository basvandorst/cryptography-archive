Ooops! I was a bit unclear in my phrasing here. The point was that this
version of the story says that a German linguist, who _happened to know
Navaho and other Amerind languages_, came to the Japanese's rescue.
Nevertheless, the coincidences involved make this embellishment highly
unlikely.

I do not work with Amerind languages, and haven't worked with any of them,
but seem to recall that Navaho _has_ relatives. I think that it is related
to Apache (?). However, the rest of the relatives are in the far north of N
America, in Canada and Alaska (the Athapascan family, I think it is
called).

Linguists use the term _isolate_ for languages that they can't place in any
family on even tentative grounds. I've seen someone claim the number
"seven" (Whole World). Can't recall them, 'though.

The linguist Greenberg operates with three emigrations and superfamilies in
the Americas (pre-Columbus, of course): Amerind, Dene-Athabascan (I'm not
sure about the name, but this is the group that Navaho belongs to) and
Eskimo-Aleut. The largest quantity by far of the languages of the Americas
belongs to the Amerind family.

The Apache and Navaho apparently came to the US Southwest long after the
pueblo peoples, for instance. They not only came in a later migration, but
probably stayed up north with their relatives until migrating southwards.

A group of comparative linguists do a lot of work on superfamilies
nowadays, and their constructions are very impressing. Take, for instance,
the Dene-Caucasian family, which is split into Dene (Dene is Navaho, by the
way, and spelt Dinee in Tony Hillerman's mysteries. It means "people", I
guess) and Sino-Caucasian. In this family languages from Basque in the west
to Navaho in the east are put together, as well as Chinese, North Caucasian
tongues, Hurrian (extinct), Sumerian (I think - also extinct) etc etc. 

This all started with the quest for relatives to Indo-European, and
Nostratic is another and very large superfamily - Fenno-Ugric, Semitic, IE
etc. etc. etc. And concerning the native languages of America, many
linguists felt postulating a large number of smaller families (as was
usually done) was intellectually unsatisfactory, as man hasn't been that
long in the New World (on the scale of historical linguistics), and the
migrations are generally thought to be few in number.

Scientific American ran (at least) two highly interesting articles about
this recently. The last one in november 1992.

The method used by "Nosatraticists" and proponents of these sundry
superfamilies, by the way, is usually computer analysis of huge quantities
of data (lexicon - vocabulary from large numbers of languages).

I'd finally like to add that both method and findings are disputed, and
that I do not know what to think myself (this is not _my_ field).
Nevertheless, it _is_ fascinating, isn't it? I would therefore not like to
be flamed for this (probably not entirely correct) posting, whethers as a
"Nostraticist" or purveyor of false data. ;-)

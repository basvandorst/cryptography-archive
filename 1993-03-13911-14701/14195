Correct.  Normal LZW doesn't do much to hide the leading plaintext when
used ahead of encryption.

Depends on the compression algorithm.  My splay tree algorithm messes
itself up pretty thoroughly with only one or two bytes of random data
prefixed to the data being compressed.  In addition, I use the encryption
key as an untransmitted prefix on the data, and I used the adaptation of
the compression data structures to the key as the primary encryption
mechanism.  It seems to work quite well, although I think it is vulnerable
to a controlled plaintext attack.

This is a minor problem with all but the smallest files!  Large files will
compress to very similar sizes independent of the initial scrambling done,
even with LZW.

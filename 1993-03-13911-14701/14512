While netsurfing, I picked up this item of interest from the EDUPAGE 
Newsletter <edupage@ivory.educom.edu>.

PRIVACY LAWS ADDRESS HIGH TECH ISSUES. A recent ruling by a
federal judge in Texas explicitly included electronically stored
information under the Privacy Protection Act. In addition, it
noted that computer bulletin boards and electronic mail are
safeguarded by federal wiretap laws against government
eavesdropping. (Wall Street Journal 3/18/93 B1)

Does this mean we don't need crypto to protect us from Big Brother
in the us? ;) ;) nudge ;) know what I mean? ;) ;) nudge nudge

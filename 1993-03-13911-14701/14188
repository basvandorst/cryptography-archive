The only known plaintext at the beginning of UNIX compress output
is a 3 byte "magic number".  There's also an undocumented switch "-n"
that suppresses the output of the magic number.  So
    % compress -n -c message | your_encryption
should produce an encrypted file where there is no "predictable stuff"
at the beginning of the file.

One warning about compress, especially with the -c flag:  I recently
tracked down a bug in the compress program that most people use, after
someone pointed out some problems they were having with compress.  The
details (and a bug fix) are in a recent article I posted to comp.compression.
The bug seems to be fixed in the most recent version of compress (sometimes
called ncompress), but I don't know if the "-n" flag works with that
version....

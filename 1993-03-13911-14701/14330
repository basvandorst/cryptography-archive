Hi,

I have some (what I'm sure are) newbie questions.
What encryption/decryption schemes have and haven't been
cracked?

There have been a few posts lately suggesting that DES can be cracked with
special hardware.  But, what about RSA and IDEA, or other methods?

Are there ways to make these schemes more secure though
multiple-encryption?  Or, in the case of RSA, using keys
large enough to make cracking unfeasible?  

What are the opinions of this group?

Of course one can. But there is still a big difference between 1 digit

I have (likely) factored more numbers with NFS than you have.
That is certainly true if one restricts to published results. Noone
else can of course say what you might have done in private.
But your arrogance in implying what I might or might not have done
with respect to NFS is wearing thin. Grow up Dan, and learn to stop
insulting your colleagues in public. Or soon you'll have no colleagues.

:Have you ever factored a difficult 384-bit number, Bob? Maybe, just
:maybe, you should label your guesses as what they are.
 
No one individual has ever factored a 384 bit number. However,
as you damn well know many people working together have factored quite a
few numbers in the 110-116 decimal digit range. Knowing how long
these took is public knowledge and hardly constitutes a 'guess'.
[N.B. 384 bits ~ 116 decimal digits]

I have, however, factored quite a few numbers (i.e. at least several hundred)
between 300 and 335 bits. It does not take much clairvoyance to see
how long 384 bits takes.

Noone else has even come close to factoring as many numbers in excess of
300 bits as I have.

This is just the base-64 encoding used by MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail
Extensions).  See RFC 1341 for more information.  It is also used by Privacy
Enhanced Mail (RFC 1113).

Basically, 24 bits of input are encoded as 4 characters.  Each group of
6 bits is represented by a printable character:
0=A, 1=B, ..., 25=Z, 26=a, ..., 51=z, 52=0, ..., 61=9, 62=+, 63=/

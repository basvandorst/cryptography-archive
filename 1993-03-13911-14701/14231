Receipt and verification of a message bearing your digital signature
"absolutely proves" nothing.  It is strong evidence that either:

   1) The message genuinely came from you, or
   2) Somebody who originated or handled the message has your private
      key, or
   3) Somebody has created a private-public key pair, signed the
      message with the private key, and convinced the recipient that
      the public key is in fact yours, or
   4) RSA (or whatever) has been cracked.

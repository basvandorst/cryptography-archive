This reminds me of something I tried in the past but won't do again because
it's such hard work.

It was with a good personal friend, someone I had known well for many
years.  I had to think for minutes to come up with some shared knowledge
which I know he wouldn't have shared with anyone else and which I knew no
one else could have witnessed.

I then had to use just the right words to get him to start replaying the
conversation we had had about this unwitnessed incident, stop giving hints
and then jump far enough ahead in that conversation that an eavesdropper
couldn't deduce the topic.  I got him to recall the conversation by using
metaphors which we had invented for that conversation and rarely used again
-- thereby identifying the conversation uniquely and jogging his memory,
while leaving an eavesdropper lost.

From this we came up with a several word passphrase which we could use to
encrypt and communicate a much longer and totally random key.


As I said, this was hard work.  It was like a one-time-pad:  once this info
was used, it could not be used again for fear of an eavesdropper
reconstructing the shared secret.

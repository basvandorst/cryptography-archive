If you insist on your dice being regular convex polyhedra, then you
can only get 4, 6, 8, 12, and 20-sided dice. A 10-sided die is
essentially two 5-faced pyramids butted together. There exist
100-sided dice, which are essentially spheres with a reasonably
symmetrical pattern of flattened circles on their surface (so the die
can come to rest), and you can fairly easily tell which number is  on
top. I can imagine it wouldn't be hard to come up with a D64 along
those lines. Alternatively, we could use a roulette wheel for getting
five bits (plus some "roll again" values), or a wheel of fortune. 

I'll be near the Strat tomorrow; I think I'll walk in and check out
their dice collection (and bring some at the IETF; maybe we should
have an FRP BOF in the context of the Security Area :-) ).

PS: I can just imagine the next release of PGP... "We need to generate
130 random bytes. Please roll 347D8 and record the result. +2 if your
charisma is 12 or over..."

Does anyone have a copy of the proceedings as published by Springer-Verlag
(not the abstracts)? I have heard a rumor that it has been published, but I
have not seen a copy.

I need the page numbers of certain articles (for references in my book), and
would appreciate hearing from anyone with a copy of the book.

Thanks,
Bruce

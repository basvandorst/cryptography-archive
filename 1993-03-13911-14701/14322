I don't see what's wrong here, then. Obviously she did see the
counterarguments after she put forward here case, and responded. Are you
saying that she didn't respond in the way you'd like? That she didn't
respond to some counterarguments put forth in CACM?

In particular, is your "2" above about counterarguments in CACM or
counterarguments here? Is there any reason to believe she read the
counterarguments here, and in time to put them in her rebuttal?

Finally, this place is not part of the professional literature, and may be
safely ignored, if desired, without any suggestion of intellectual
dishonesty.

I was Associate Editor of Annual Reviews of Energy for seven years, and so
far I've seen nothing about Denning's behavior that would justify any
suggestion of impropriety. Many authors rely entirely on the referees or
editors for comments on proposed papers, communications, or letters before
publication, and see no need to take them to public comment. She obviously
met whatever policy CACM had, in her original piece. Then she responded to
comments in CACM, in a subsequent piece there. What's the problem?

Unless there's something Dennning's done which I don't yet understand, her
behavior seems unexceptionable.

This despite my strong disagreement with her proposal.

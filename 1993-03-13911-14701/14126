	Fact.  There was a reunion of code-talkers (as they were called)
	earlier this year.  They spoke about it on NPR a few months ago.

	BZZT. Myth not fact.  (Tell your German that he can get off his high
	horse. ;-) ) Remember this was "real time" encryption of very 
	time-sensitive info done by speaking a language into a radio 
	transmitter in the field.  The Japanese would have had to:

		1. train a whole lot of people to speak fluent navaho in a 
		   short time and get them into the field.

		2. Make wire (tape wasn't available) recordings of the
	           talk to be translated in Tokyo and the info made
		   available later in the field.  Remember, the state
		   of communications was MUCH more primitive in the
		   1940s.  By the time the stuff was translated and
		   the info made available the info would be stale.

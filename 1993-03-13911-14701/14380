The factorization of M523 has no cryptographic significance whatever.
It was done by the Number Field Sieve. The only reason the factorization
could be done was that  M523 has a representation as a polynomial with
VERY small coefficients.  (x^5 - 4 = 0 mod N,  x = 2^105)   

This will not be the case for RSA numbers. RSA numbers near 512 bits will
yield polynomials with coefficients around 26 decimal digits, not 1 digit.
This has a profound impact on the run time.
 
I am getting a little tired of having to say this.

Please. Do us all a favor: Leave assertions about the difficulty of
factoring to those working in this area.

On the other hand, 384 bit general numbers are well within range
for the Quadratic Sieve.

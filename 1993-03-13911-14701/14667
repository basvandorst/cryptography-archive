Please!  Anyone who wants to deal with this subject MUST read the following
paper:

S.H.Kim & C. Pomerance
The probability that a random probable prime is composite.
Math. Comp. Vol. 53 (1989) pp. 721-741


The true conjectured density of Carmichael numbers is n^(1-epsilon), but
they really are irrelevent for the purpose of testing probable primes,
because there is no such analogue of Carmichael numbers for the strong
probable prime test (known as Miller-Rabin). There are no strong prp's 
to all bases.

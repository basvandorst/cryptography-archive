i agree. my reply was made before this kind of embedded 
identification was being discussed. it was in response to someone who 
said that it would be sufficient to simply require a special view. 
that would, of course, be useless with the encryption of snapshot 
programs, not to mention the fact that one wouldn't be able to do 
anything with the picture besides look at it on your screen. and how 
useful is that?

Navaho used as "code" by US Army in WWii - Fact or Myth?
--------------------------------------------------------

I've several times seen the story that the US Army employed Amerind
speakers 
(in most versions of the story the language in question is Navaho) who
translated messages before transmission (or retranslated received messages
into English).

The story concludes that this completely baffled the Japanese.

The question is - is this myth or fact? It sounds a wee bit too much like 
one of those "wandering stories".

[By the way, a German student came with a further embellishment of the
story - the Japanese got help from a German linguist and expert, who easily
translated this "code"]

Yours,

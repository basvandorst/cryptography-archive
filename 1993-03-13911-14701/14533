Well, you're wrong <grin>. Finding *all* known primes in a given range by
systematic factoring *is* time consuming, but there are relatively 
straightforward algorithms that generate a single prime number of a particular
magnitude. I can track down one if you're really interested (put probably
the PK tool authors here have better info than me).

I don't think you're completely correct.  In fact, I just saw a news
item a few weeks about a proposed change in U.S. law to eliminate the
deposit requirement.  The Library of Congress opposed the change,
saying that it was an important way that they built up their
collection.

You're right that the law no longer requires any action to secure a
copyright.  Under the Berne Convention, to which the U.S. is a
signatory, copyright is vested at the moment the work is created.
*However* -- you still must deposit a copy of your work when you
register a copyright.  I think that registration is necessary in order
to sue for damages, though you can postpone registration until you need
to sue.  (I'm not certain of the details on that.  As I recall, Dan
Bernstein has posted some good stuff on copyright law in the past.)
There is such a thing as unpublished copyrighted material, in which
case the libraries would not, of course, have copies.

Then an enterprising subscriber uses his favorite image processing tools
to crop 1/8" along each edge of the picture, corrupting the signature
(if it depends on all the bits). I suppose you could make the "signature"
depend on only a comparatively few bits scattered around the image. In
fact, the actual bits checked might be different for each customer. Still,
it sounds to me like two customers could compare their copies and generate
a third based on how they cross-correlate.

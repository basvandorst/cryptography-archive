The obvious (but inefficient) way to do this would be using separate public
keys for each person to establish a shared archive containing the target
key multiply-encrypted using all possible permutations of member keys.
As only set membership, and not order, is important (you could assign an
arbitrary ordering among members), the number of permutations is small.
The sets could be genereated automatically, and while possibly time consuming
(today, an hour or more on a PC), presumably the importance of information
protected with such a complex scheme warrants the added time per instance.

My math might be in error, but off the top of my head, the formula for number
of encrypted sets should be m*(n-m+1), where n is the total population, and
n is the subset population. In the example, then, the number of encrypted
sets would be 5*(8-5+1) or 20. The identification of groupings could be
predetermined by the order of the sets. A given group of five people would
choose the set corresponding to their group, then apply their private keys
in the predefined sequence.

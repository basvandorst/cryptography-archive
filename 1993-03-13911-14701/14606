Your concept of triple encryption is right, but as already stated you really
have one 112-bit key, not two 56-bit keys.  The IBM "Common Cryptographic
Architecture" (CCA) defines two key types for these two purposes - all "data"
is encrypted with single length "data keys", while keys can ONLY be encrypted
using double length "key encrypting keys".  Each is viewed as a single key;
the double-length key is not viewed as a pair.

You may have a problem if you want to triple encrypt DATA, as in a file.  I'm
not quite certain, but I think the NSA strongly frowns on using double length
keys to encrypt data.  I think they only permit it for encrypting keys.  It's
sort of like the "exportable algorithm" issue - if your encryption method is
too strong, they don't want you using it to encrypt data, just keys.

Perhaps someone else can confirm this, since I don't completely trust my
memory on the subject.  If need be, I think I know where I could confirm it
myself.

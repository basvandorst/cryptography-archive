     I am responding to a request from Jim Gillogly to provide 15 letters of
plain text.  OK, it ends with DELIGHTFULHUMANBEING.  I want to see whether
I'm getting what the different people are saying.  If I use three words,
say the first is of length 5, the second 8, and the third 10, could I do
this: I run the first word through, then I concatenate the first and second,
giving a length of 13 and run that combo through, and then I concatenate
that combo with the third word, now getting 23, and I run this through a
third time.  Here's the question: if the plaintext is shorter than 
5 X 13 X 23 (about 1500) characters, is it too difficult to try to decode
it, since there would be less than one full period?  Also, what happens when
a word goes in again as a subword? 
    Please tell me what IC means.  
    Thanks,

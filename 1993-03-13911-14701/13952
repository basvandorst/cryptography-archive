This only applies if a and b are prime.  For example

If p,q, and r are primes congruent to 1 mod 4, and (p/r)=(q/r)=-1, then

(r / pq) = (as claimed) (pq / r) = (p / r) (q / r) = 1, but
(r / p) = (p / r) = -1.

(There is still an algorithm, but it requires factoring, and possibly
(-1 / p) and (2 / p), which depend on p mod 8.

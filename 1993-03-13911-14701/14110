Howdy!

I am looking for a medical imaging laboratory in Dallas-Forthworth
area to visit and work for from June-19-1993 to July-10-1993.  
I am a second year Ph.D student in applied physics. I'll be
travelling to USA to attend and present papers at the following 
two upcoming medical imaging meetings: 

(1) XIIIth int. conf. on Information Processing in Medical Imaging
(IPMI), Flagstaff, AZ, 14-18 June, 1993.

(2) Mathematical Methods in Medical Imaging II, San Diego, CA., 
11-16 July, 1993.

I am interested in the following areas:
Bayesian image reconstruction in PET
Registration of different imaging modalites - in particular PET and MRI
Fuzzy segmentation of MRI.   

Please feel free to contact me for any other information.

Regards,

Actually Dorothy was factually incorrect on that point. Marc
specifically 
mentioned abuses by the govt going into the 70s. Dorothy either
didnt see 
it or chose to ignore it.

There is an interesting political controversy over in France right
now
with allegations that a special French counter-intelligence group was
wiretapping journalists, an actress and the political opposition,
along
with the bars they frequented, their cook's appt and various other
places. its interesting becuase Docs that I recieved from OMB
indicate
that the FBI got their idea for the digital telephony proposal from
the French. 

IO'm wiring up a story for the Privacy Times with more details. I'll
post it whem I'm 
done.

Well, then you will see a major diplomatic brawl which will include
pressure on other countries to cut the violator off from the Internet.

This has already been a problem with pirates who produce disks,
manuals, and packages that only a real expert can tell are fakes.
Microsoft was involved in one convoluted case that involved pirating
in mainland China and a PRC government lab that had produced the
technology to duplicate the hologram that Microsoft puts on every box
of software they ship and which they thought was totally secure.  The
case ended up involving everything from private detectives to high
level diplomatic discussions and threats of trade sanctions between
the US and China.

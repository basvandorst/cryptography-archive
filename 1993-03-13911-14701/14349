Thanks to all those who posted public and sent private comments on this. The
argument I like best is that the number of 512k RSA key pairs is greater
than the number of atoms (or maybe it was particles) in the universe. That
answers the question of how much storage space it would take to hold them
pretty dramatically.

I guess I'm back to watching out for breakthroughs in factoring, and most
realistically, physical compromise.

Best;
David

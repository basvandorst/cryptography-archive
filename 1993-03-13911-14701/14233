Some people have raised the question of whether the compression used in
PGP will produce some known plaintext at the beginning of the message.
This is an important concern, and it should be raised.

I considered that in the design of PGP.  PGP uses cipher feedback mode
with a random initialization vector at the beginning of the file.
This random material has the effect of disrupting the known plaintext
pattern that follows it.  Because of this technique, I think PGP avoids
the known plaintext problem.

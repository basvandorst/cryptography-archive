In this case the term I use to refer to someoen who does this is "lucky".
You are making a wager of sorts that the keys you have developed contain
within them the key you are looking for.

10^150 = rough est of possible keys using 512 bit keyspace

Now if you have 100 million keys lets say (your 10 million machines making
1 million keys) your chances are 1 in 10^150/10^8 = 1 in 10^142.

One in 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,
000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,
000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.

In other words, not very likely at all.

I believe that it is called the "Do you feel lucky?" scenario :-)

Anyone can get lucky, and anyone can win the lottery.  The size of the
keyspace that needs to be searched just determines how lucky you have to be
to stumble onto the right key.  For most modern cryptosystems you need to
be really, really, really lucky.

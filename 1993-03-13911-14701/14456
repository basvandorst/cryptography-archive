A while back I tried an experiment with some modern (high density)
5.25" and 3.5" floppies. I bulk erased them repeatedly with a Radio Shack
handheld degausser (until the thermal cutout kicked in, in fact).  When I
put them back into the machine I was stunned to see that I could still
read part of their directories (though they *were* severely damaged).

Apparently the modern oxides used in high density disks have such high
thresholds that relatively wimpy bulk erasers like that Radio Shack
model just aren't enough.

So at least some of NSA's paranoia here is justifiable.

It really shouldn't be that hard to do, just analyze the way the
information is stored, shift the color of each byte in question 1 time
off the normal in selected parts of the picture and you're off.

The selected bytes will have to be calculated according to
identification information of the user. Hell, this could even be done
on-line in a download BBS.

The bytes should initally be in a known pattern which a 'decrypt'
software would scan for. Once the inital pattern would be found, it'd
be easy to scan for the rest bytes. The initial pattern should have
encoding information in itself, f ex there could be 12 different
information storage styles and according to the init pattern the
software would scan for the right bytes in the picture.

Well, who wants to go on and program this...

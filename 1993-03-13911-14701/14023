	You'd be infringing upon someone else's copyright bub.  Unless, of
course, you have prior permission to do so from Playboy and Hefner, et al.

	Bingo... one point for you.

	Whoa!!  Two out of three... are we on a roll now?

	Check out the "registered" games on the market right now.  people copy
them indescriminately and play them without registering them.  Yeah... i'm sure
there are a few kind souls out there that register their copies of the
software... but for every one that does... there are probably 20 more that
don't.

	What _I_ would suggest... is that you not use PLAYBOY or any
other published medium for your base work.  Try going out and getting some
girls to model for you.  Maybe some college girls... like PB did an issue on
the college girls... veddy nize....  Because if you do a medium like PB or PH
or something like that... sure you're gonna get the top models... but damn if
you ain't gonna have to pay royalties up the wazzoo to use their shots.  PB
gets a cut, the photographer gets a cut... and with some deals... the girl and
her agent get cuts also [post-magazine use].   You're talkin' quite a bit of
cash there bub.   I'm not tryin' ta discourage you...  just maybe give you a
few ideas around the initial copyright problems.  Find your own models.


also... any cyber-moron with a mac and a scanner can create their own images
from the pages of Playboy.  Why would they want to buy your product if they can
do the same thing themselves?!  Think about it.  To properly market something,
you must first give the consumer something that they cannot do themselves - very
easily anyway...

				just some ideas in the spirit of being helpful

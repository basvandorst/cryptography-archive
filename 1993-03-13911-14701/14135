   I stumbled upon a method of coding messages that is very simple and
seems to me to be very secure.  I am curious how long it will take 
someone to decode a simple message.  The quick-and-dirty program I 
wrote to implement this method turns all letters into uppercase,
and it doesn't take care of any punctuation.  So, maybe that will 
make the message too hard to decode, I don't know.  I didn't intend
that; it's just a by-product of the program I wrote.  Also, I don't
know whether the message is too short.  If it is, please tell me,
and I'll modify the program to take longer messages.  Here is the
message:

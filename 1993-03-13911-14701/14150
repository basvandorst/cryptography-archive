That would be no problem for a 'well equipped' signals unit.  For distance,
the problem would be the level of background noise.  In the middle of a
totally uninhabited area, many kilometers (>5-10) for a pooly shielded unit.  
In the middle of a city, measure this in meters:)  See the writings in the
literature re: TEMPEST for more info on this general topic.

This department must have an excess of $$.  A lot of things put out similar
RF.  And I am sure Cincinnati Microwave is capable of putting out a
super shielded unit :)

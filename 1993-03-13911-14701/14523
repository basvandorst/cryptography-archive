One nice way to do this is to use the property of polynomials that an
Nth degree polymonial is uniquely determined if you know N+1 distinct
points anywhere on the curve.  Using your example, where we want 5 pieces
to work but not 4, means we need a 4th drgree polyonomial.  If we choose
a 4th degree polynomial P such that p(0) is the key, and give the
8 people the pairs (1,P(1)), (2,P(2)), ... (8, P(8)), (but not the
polynomial itself) then any 5 or more of them can use their set of points 
to reconstruct the original polynomial and evaluate it at 0 to get the key, 
but 4 or fewer do not have enough information to do that.

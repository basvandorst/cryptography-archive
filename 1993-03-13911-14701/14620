One time pads are secure. The problem is they cannot be reused, and the
person at the other end has to know which 'key' you are using. It nmeans
a lot of transport of random junk, and concern over synchronization. It
also menas the  disk or tape can be lost stolen etc a lot more easily
than can a 56 (128, 1024) bit string, and is a lot more obvious. etc.

No, I understand. The problem is that the CO *will not accept* the whole
source code, unless it is less than 50 pages. I know, as I've run into this
problem with my own filings (I accidentally sent the first and last 50 pages
rather than the first and last 25. By filing was summarily rejected. I re-filed
in person, and they explained the problem in more detail).

I doubt if Lotus Notes is only fifty pages long. Thus you won't be able
archive the source code publicly in this manner. Even if you could, I don't
think Lotus would tolerate the marketing disadvantage of havings its source
code available for anybody to study!

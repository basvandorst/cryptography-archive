Well, you can send the OTP (One-Time Pad) via an insecure channel ;)

In any case, SOMEHOW the recipient has to have a copy of your OTP.

You have hit on one of the three problems of OTPs...

1) The OTP has to be a truly random set of bits  and
2) a copy of the OTP has to be distributed to users and
3) the OTP must be kept secure at all times.

Problem one is not much of a problem.  Problem two usually requires transport
via a secure person.  Problem three requires physical security.

I once asked why OTPs were not widely used. I never got a good answer (suprise 
suprise!).  But with laser disks, I don't understand why this isn't done.

#3 must be assumed no matter what system you are using.

#2 can not be much of a problem for the US.  They have to distribute keys
now via this route anyway.  Why not laser disks instead of keys?

Maybe it is just bureaucratic inertia... ??  (It was a long time before
naval guns had rifling after its worth was shown...)

Hay Meade guys!... just my $0.02 :)

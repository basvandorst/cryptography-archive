I have heard rumors of an ECMA standard for computer authorization called sesame
(I think).  My rumor indicated that it was an alternative (?) to Kerberos.  I
checked to see if our news server had the crypt FAQ (obvious answer - not on file
right now).  If any one can start pointing me in the right direction I sure
would appreciate it.  My apologies for what is certainly a pretty low level
question.

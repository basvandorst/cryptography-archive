Christopher, I don't think you quite understand what I'm looking for.
I'm not trying to encrypt information.  I am trying to put an
undeleteable signature on it.  The idea is to make small changes that
are invisisble to the naked eye and which cannot be removed without
seriously distorting the picture.  That way I can tell where an
unauthorized copy came from.

Well, that's the key.  You need to weave the signature into the entire
picture so it can't be deleted without seriously degrading picture quality.

Right.  So what is needed is a way of embedding the signature in the
picture so that it is impossible to "sufficiently obscure" it without

i think this is the best argument for removable media drives. keep
all your sensitive data on a m-o drive with a disk melting device 
nearby. all you'd have to do is yank the disk, toss it in the box, 
hit the detonator & *whoomph*. toasted data. a high powered electro
magnet might do the job, but there's probably some way to recover 
from that even.

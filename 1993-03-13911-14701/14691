     I am looking for references to algorithms which can be used for
password encryption. I.e., someone has a clear-text word, runs it
through the algorithm, and it becomes some other sequence of symbols.
I want this algorithm to have the property that it is a) next to
impossible to reverse, and b) would take too long to try all possible
words to see which one works (even by use of a high-speed computer).
Please send references or ideas to mlevin@husc8.harvard.edu.

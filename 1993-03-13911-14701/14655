   A while back I tried an experiment with some modern (high density)
   5.25" and 3.5" floppies. I bulk erased them repeatedly with a Radio Shack
   handheld degausser (until the thermal cutout kicked in, in fact).  When I
   put them back into the machine I was stunned to see that I could still
   read part of their directories (though they *were* severely damaged).

Interesting!  On the other hand, 5.25" floppies make a very secure, satisfying,
crunchy noise when you run them through a paper-shredder :-)
(Take the jackets off first.  I assume 3.5" floppies will work ok too.)

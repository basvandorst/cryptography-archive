Disagreement. Look at this message:
Data=Encrypt(Message+Signature(Message))
Encrypt= 'Applying the receivers public key to the (...)data'
Sign   = 'Applying MD5(for example) on the Message, then encrypting
          the MD5-hash with he senders secret key'

The attacker can NOT strip a signature, unless he is able to decrypt
'data' with the secret key of the receiver.
The receiver is NOT able to generate a signature for any other message
than the one he received, as he does not know the secret key of the
sender.

Please remember that 'signing messages' does not mean a lot of 
authentification, unless public keys are certified by an entity
to which the sender and recipient have trust. (They can sign each others
public key, if you want :-) )

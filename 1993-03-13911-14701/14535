Last time we were having a political chat, I asked for, and received
the addresses of our US Congress.  Unfortunately, I didn't keep track
of that person's name.

Thanks for the last one, whomever you were!

Now, since there has been an election with more than average turnover,
could I ask that individual to either post generally or send me that
information again?

Better still, that would be an excellent item to post as a FAQ (or,
at least, something to have on news.answers).  In the meantime, can somone
spoil me again with the good stuff?

I found Denning's comments in last Thursday's Wall Street Journal
interesting.  The article is entitled "Ruling Gives Laws On Privacy
a Hi-Tech Edge" and is about the SJG decision.

	At the same time, some law enforcement official see
	the decision as a threat to their ability to investigate
	hackers and computer crime.  And Dorothy Denning, 
	computer science chairwoman at Georgetown University,
	says past case have shown hackers can do great damage.
	"I don't think the government's fear was misplaced,"
	she said.

Wall Street Journal, March 18, 1993, p. B5, col.6.

If you add enough white noise, there will be no signature, ok. But at
the same time you have degraded the quality of the image enough to 
make it attractive for the viewer to acquire an original version (buy it).

But adding white noise or doing some dithering/filtering so that sublime
signatures are 'washed out' and the details of the original picture are
still there would allow you to use the following, already mentioned method
to hide signatures in pictures:
Just modify a substantial part of the picture (giving it a new meaning) like
adding/changing some details of the picture. (As somebody said: Add a new
flower to the ornament of the vase that was pictured)

Disagreement ?

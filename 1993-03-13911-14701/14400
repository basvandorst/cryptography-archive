     As I understand it, the argument in favor of key registration is that it
   allegedly strikes a reasonable balance between:

     1.  The privacy of users, and

     2.  The government's need to read the traffic of criminals such as drug
	   dealers, terrorists, etc.

     Meanwhile, back in the real world, such a scheme strikes a blanace between:

     1.  The privacy of users, and

     2.  The government's need to read the traffic of persons who disregard the
	   laws against drug dealing, terrorism, etc. but scrupulously obey the
	   (hypothetical) laws requiring key registration.

I'm interested in seeing a numerical estimate from a key registration
supporter of exactly how many drug deals, terroist acts, molested
children, etc. key registration is likely to prevent.  Such an
estimate will permit us to put key registration in perspective with
other safety-vs-liberty tradeoffs.  For example, it is much easier in
the US than anywhere else in the industrialized world for any random
bozo to buy a handgun.  If key registration advocates can't argue that
key registration would reduce the total amount of crime in the US
at least as much as handgun control would, then perhaps they should
change their priorities to other issues.

Does anyone have such an estimate?

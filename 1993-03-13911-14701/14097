RE: Navajo 'Code Talkers'

FYI

I have spoken with an individual who had the opportunity to do some service
work with the Navajo.  In the process, he also had to learn the language.
This information is second hand, but I'll repeat it as clearly as I can
recall.

Navajo 'code talkers' were used in WWII.  I'm not certain of their precise
duties, but they still celebrate their achievements in the Navajo nation
today.  (they have an anual parade or some such...).

One of the difficulties of Navajo, as my friend explained, is that it makes
high use of similies and metaphores.  In other words, you not only need to
know the words, but also the background of the individual(s) who is speaking.

After two years of dealing directly with the Navajo, this person was able to
carry on day-to-day conversations well, such as dealing with someone at a
store or getting your hair cut or other approx. 5yr-old tasks.  But when some
of the older people would get into more complex discussions, the allusions
used by them went right over his head.

I have also recently wondered if a system of metaphoric language could be
utilized in key transmission over regular phone lines between persons
only familiar with the metaphors being invoked.  Probably a bad idea for
many reasons (I'm still new to cryptography), but for small amounts of
critical information, it might just work.

Hope this helps!

                                 Hello experts !

I'm fairly new to cryptography at  all  and  I'm  very  interested  in  how
crackin' a code works. It's not because I want to crack codes, just because
I don't have the slightest idea how something like that could be realised.

Let's say you get an uuencoded binary and all you know is  that  it  is  an
encrypted textfile. You have no idea which method is used... How do you try
to get the plaintext?

Another question is: How could one crack  encrypted  executables?  I  can't
imagine a way how a machine could determine wether the  data  is  decrypted
correctly. When cracking texts one can "simply" check for some rules of the
specific language, but computer-data have no real "system" you can  use  to
find out wether some data makes sense or not.

I hope someone can help me.

        bye, Peter

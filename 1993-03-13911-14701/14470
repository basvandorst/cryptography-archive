I agree with Bohdan Tashchuk that reiterating the original points is a
waste of time. And I *started* the 1000-message flame war by posting
the "A Triall Balloon to Ban Encryption?" message.

Here I disagree. Increasing our awareness of the issue of key
registration, with its legal and technical ramifications, has got to
be at least as important to sci.crypt as, say, the 25th discussion of
the Beale cipher or the 33rd thread on whether DES has been broken.

Granted, after a thousand posts, most were repeating the same points
over and over again.

: and don't participate in flame wars on the net.


And I congratulate Prof. Denning for being one of the few crypto policy
people (based on her papers and speeches, not necessarily on any
official position in the government) to actually read and *respond to*
posts in this group.

Too bad more law enforcement types aren't being similarly open.

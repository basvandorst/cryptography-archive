There was a seminar in London in about 1985 at which IBM revealed how they'd
sued clonemakers who copied parts of the XT and AT ROMs. The trick was what
they called `software birthmarks'; these are things like the order in which
registers are pushed and popped. There are apparently enough of these features
in hand-written 8086 assembler to make any particular program unique.

If the birthmark generation process can be automated, then you will not only
be able to hide a serial number in the program. You could hide a digital
signature, or come to think of it, an encrypted message.

Uploading and downloading innocuous looking software thus gives a useful covert 
channel for the espionage people.

I wonder how many of them have noticed this?

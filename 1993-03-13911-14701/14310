Have you not been reading? It's been pointed out that the publication lead
times are such that it is unlikely she saw the technical objections before
submitting her article.

It's always a bad idea to accuse people of base motives without hard
evidence, particularly when a perfectly simple alternative explanation is at
hand. In fact, it's the kind of behavior that gets some in a lot of trouble.

Though I disagree strongly with Denning's proposal, I think the attacks on
her have been entirely unwarranted, and say more about the attackers than
about her.

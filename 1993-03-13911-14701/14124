The story is quite true.  See "The Codebreakers" by David Kahn, Macmillan
Publishing Co., New York, 1967, pp. 549-550.

During World War I, Choctaw Indians were used.  

During World War II, the Signal Corps tested Comanches and Indians 
from Michigan and Wisconsin in war games, but the Navahos 
were used in combat, primarily in the Marines in the Pacific.  
Kahn reports that there were only 28 non-Navahos
who spoke the language, and none of them were 
German or Japanese.  Also, the language was very different
from other languages, with people who learned Navaho
as adults readily differentiable from native speakers. 
Furthermore, a few sylables could mean a tremendous amount.  
For example, "na'ildil"  (with accents omitted)
means "You are accustomed to eat plural separable objects one at a time." 

Note that Navaho was chosen, both for secrecy (the enemy couldn't understand) 
and for authentication (the enemy couldn't spoof transmitted orders without
a native Navaho speaker).

See the book for more details.

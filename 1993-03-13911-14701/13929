Sounds good, but just one point - why bother?  The outside noise will be
present, but the human brain does a pretty good job of focusing in on a
conversation despite other sounds.  The situation shouldn't be any worse
than sitting in an open window and trying to listen in on a conversation
within a room - not too tough (unless you are by a freeway or an airport
:)  

Maybe it's time to start encrypting our normal speech ;)

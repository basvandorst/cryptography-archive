-| Excerpts from netnews.sci.crypt: 4-Mar-93 Permanent signatures for pi..
-| by Michael Friedman@us.orac 
-|  Is there any way that I can add a customer ID to every picture I sell
-|  that will have little or no impact on picture quality but will not be
-|  removable by the customer without seriously degrading picture quality?
-|  That way I can't prevent pictures from being given away, but I can cut
-|  that customer off or even sue him.

You will trace the costumer but this does not mean he/she is the person who 
distributed your image. There is no law stating that you HAVE to protect your 
directories. If you want other people to copy images from your file space you 
are free to do so. I would guess you will mainly succeed in putting people off 
using your images altogether. Electronic tagging sounds like a fun research 
topic however.

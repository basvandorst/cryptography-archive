I think the bar code is a USA special feature.

Most countries now issue "machine readable passports" with OCR-
-recognizable lettering, although I had not heard of the barcode
before.  In particular, as of ~1987 all the major industrialized
countries, including all of the EEC, agreed on common formats for
machine readable passports.

Checking a Canadian passport issued in Jan 85, it was not
machine-readable (it was typed with a faded ribbon on a typewriter!),
but one issued in Dec 91 *is* machine-readable.  The machine-readable
info is just the standard passport information -- country, passport
number, dates of issue/expiry, name, date of birth, place of birth,
etc.  At least in my case, there are no "mystery" fields of information.

Because only OCR is being used, it's clear that there's no extra
"hidden information" and that everything is read-only.

The British magazine "New Scientist" ran an article ~ 6 years ago
on the introduction of the machine readable passport, perhaps someone
with an index could [ea]grep for it?  (I recall photocopying it, but
alas my files of "interesting old articles" form a good illustration
of the 2nd law of thermodynamics in action...)  The article described
the format in detail.  It did say that there were optional fields
that individual countries could use if they wished; on my passport
these are filled with pad ( < or > ) characters.  There was no
mention of bar codes or magnetic stripes in the article.

It seems the designers of Dolphin Encrypt have thought of most things
like this.  The encryption/decryption commands I use in the batch file
specify no target file name for output, so the file resulting from the
operation has the same name as the input file.  What actually happens
in this case (assuming we are encrypting), according to Page 4.2 of
the documentation, is that "Dolphin Encrypt first writes the encrypted
data to a temporary file.  If the encryption is successful then the
program purges (that is, overwrites and deletes) the original file and
renames the temporary file with the name of the original file."  Thus
there is no plaintext left lying around on the disk for someone to
recover, since it was overwritten.  The only data left on the disk
after the batch file is finished is the ciphertext.
 
There's also a purge program (along with some other utility programs)
included in the package, so you can yourself purge any plaintext files
you want to get rid of.
 
But, yes, decrypting to a RAM disk is a good idea, though it makes it
a little less convenient to load the decrypted spreadsheet file from
within this Windows-based spreadsheet program.

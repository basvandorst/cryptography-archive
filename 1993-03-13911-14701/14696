While Germano's explanation of why 64 bits of DES output becomes 11
characters is accurate, it misses the real reason that the cleartext and
ciphertext of Unix passwords don't have the same length.  The Unix password
is not encrypted to produce the ciphertext.  It is the key used to encrypt
a string of 64 zero bits.  The result of encrypting these 64 bits is 64 bits.
This result is encoded into ASCII producing an 11 character string.

You could just as well use a 16 character password to perform the encryption
of the 64 zero bits.  One simple method would be to use the first 8 characters
to encrypt the 64 zero bits and then use the remaining 8 characters to
encrypt the result again.  The output would still be 64 bits which encodes
into 11 ASCII characters.

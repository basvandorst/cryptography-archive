I was just reading through the PGP 2.1 docs earlier this evening, and
something I noticed there might apply--the -m option, which allows display
of a message but not saving or any other output.  

If this were to be a 'subscription' service, each person might receive a
version of the picture encrypted with a variation on that, which allows
display of the picture with a custom decrypting viewer.  Of course, you'd
have to put together a viewer that included that sort of option.  If you
_really_ wanted to get yourself in trouble, you could probably arrange
permission to use some of the PGP code, possibly deterring people from just
passing around keys.  But, then, PKP might not approve.

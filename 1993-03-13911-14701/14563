We are doing research into RSA algorithms ...
We have heard that the University of Queensland in Australia
has released source code and documentation in this area. Does anyone
know of an ftp site that has this information?

Can anyone recommend papers on RSA and references about where it has 
been used in commerce and inustry?

Thank You.

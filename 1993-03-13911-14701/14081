I'll believe it proverbially ...

An earlier posting said /tmp/pgp which was empty.  archie on ic itself
said /spool/tmp/pgp which was empty ...

God, this is exciting isn't?  (answer: no.)

(btw thanks to all the people who e-mailed with directions to pgp22. 
sadly, since personal computer world gave away demon ftp software and
published nic.funet.fi and doc.ic.ac.uk 's addresses they've been almost
inaccessible, seems to me.)

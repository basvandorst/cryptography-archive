Hi,
this only marginally fits to sci.crypt, but where else ...

I shortly a got a version of the 'cbw' of
   Robert W. Baldwin  
baldwin@xx.lcs.mit.edu
   mit-eddie!baldwin  
     October, 1986

And have found it quite interesting and wellworking!
My compliments to the author, where ever he is now.

I am just wondering about a couple of things:
- Is there a never version than October '86 ?
- Does somebody already have (re-) written the
  tools for generating the bigrams, or even better
- does anybody have bigram-statistics for german language ?

- Does anybody know what approach would be used today to break the
  real Enigma (not just the 1.5-wheel Unix crypt(1)) that was used 
  during WWII ? 

I would be happy to hear any positive suggestions,

	Germano Caronni

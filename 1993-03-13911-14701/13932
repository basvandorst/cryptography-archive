I post something called the "temporary, independent sci.crypt FAQ" about once
a month.  Should also be in news.answers, though I am still somewhat a novice at
this stuff.                                                                                                              

Last posting was around Feb 11.  

Perhaps my article needs to be posted every other week?
Or, can you good netters out there point out some problems (other than 
ordinary human impatience) that these postings represent.  I seem to see them
right about now every month.

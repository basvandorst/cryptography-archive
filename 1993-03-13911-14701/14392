Just as an illustrative note, in a freshman physics course I took years ago,
we computed the likehood of a object successfully refracting through a door
to be on the order of 10^75 to 1 against, using wave/particle duality
equations.  I would think that the chances the message would materialize
in front of you would be less than 10^142 to one against.

Oh, and the accepted scientific definition of impossible is around 10^30
to one against.

Now how lucky do you feel?

-Tim Cuffel	Finger for PGP 2.1  The CIA has admitted that the assassination

They failed, of course.  Seems as though that motorcade through downtown Dallas
trick only works once.

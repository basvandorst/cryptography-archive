I got my copy from src.doc.ic.ac.uk, but I checked that site again after
reading Hollands's post and found that the files have apparently been
removed.  I've never had much luck downloading files from "incoming" or
"upload" directories at ftp sites;  I think that you'll probably have to
wait until the archive administrators at garbo and other sites get around
to putting it into the the main file areas.  That should happen in a
couple of days, hopefully.

I looked at Carl's suggestion again, and decided it's not appropriate for
this application.  He's describing the "kappa" test, which gives less
information for period determination than my method of getting the average
IC over all columns, which is described on page 73 of Sinkov's "Elementary
Cryptanalysis".  The kappa test is covered in Kahn's "The Codebreakers",
and as I said earlier, it's suitable for finding overlaps in long periods.
For example, if you have a bunch of intercepts from a rotor machine with a
long period, you can slide them against each other to see where the rotors
have lined up -- with enough text you'll get a substantial peak when they
match.

The reason it's less sensitive for this application is that each period
is only being compared for matches with its adjacent period.  With the
"average IC over columns" method, you're look at matches between all the
periods in the cryptogram.  Looking at both systems applied to the single
Vigenere posted a little while ago:

    ZYIQN ITDAH WQQIA YYLZE EQPQV VRJCV WKEJS CGMPD TYCYN QUKUV XJIUN
    OLZWE OZEOH MMDMX KBTAM EHBQY MOIHM QJKOL QOVTK XWZTE NAKXM LVCMW
    HEGKI HMBCX WPRW

       Per  Avg IC  Kappa

	 6 0.04465 0.04274
	 7 0.03804 0.06034
----->   8 0.05818 0.06087
	 9 0.03825 0.02632
	10 0.04289 0.03540
	11 0.03691 0.04464
	12 0.05067 0.06306

As you can see, the maximum of the average IC's is a fairly strong peak,
and not too far away from the hoped-for 0.066.  The kappa value for period
8 is also high, but it's high for period 7 as well, and higher still for
period 12.

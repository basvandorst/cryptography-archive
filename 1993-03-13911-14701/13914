Yes and no.  Yes, they're going to block attempts to use this for
privacy.  More precisely, they're not going to enable use of their
certificates for secret communications.  And we already know how that
will happen -- because they'll almost certainly be required to use the
NIST digital signature algorithm.  My understanding is that NIST has
admitted that that was one of their design criteria.  But that's a far
cry from legislative or administrative sanctions against people who do
use PGP or the like.

I'm not going to answer your charge that the government would suppress
cryptographic software if its use became widespread enough.  Not that I
don't have opinions on the subject -- but until there's a newsgroup
sci.crypt.research, I hesitate to participate in a flamewar that would
make the ITARwars look like a dim ember...

Some years ago in high school, I had an idea that one could defeat the use
of supercomputers for breaking an encryption scheme by designing a scheme
that was dependent upon the speed at which the plaintext was encrypted and
decrypted.  I never had a chance to follow up on it, but it seemed
interesting.  I thought at first that this could be accomplished by
recording performance information regarding the encrypting/decrypting
computer and using this as part of the key.  I discarded that possibility,
since the same information could be fed into a supercomputer and used for
the cryptanalysis (providing the machine used was known).  Recently I had
an idea that a time-dependent encryption could be accomplished with some
sort of black box that used a time-inherent physics principle of some
sort.  Does anyone else have any ideas?
  It seems to me that the principal vulnerability of high-end crypto
schemes is the modern supercomputer; if this could be closed up, it
_seems_ feasible to construct an "absolutely" secure crypto system. 
Whether or not this is practical is another matter entirely... my interest
is literally academic.  Any comments/thoughts?

                       Thanks,

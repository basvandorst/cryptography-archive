Well, this really has nothing to do with crypto (so sue me, i will add an
obcrypt at the end...) but another factor that adds to the prices of
defense items is the fact that they are held up to much higher standards
than what you will find in the commercial market.  I still remember the
line in an old CDC Cyber system manual that gave the vaporization point for
the computer as required by some strange law or pruchasing regulation that
consisted of a lot of numbers and letters....

No how exactly does one figure out the vaporization point of a computer
that fills most of a room?  And who do I talk to in order to get tickets to
watch...  :)

obcrypt:  At the present time it seems that "triple-DES" is the way to go
for securing files using DES.  As I have heard this involves encrypting the
file with key A, then decrypting it with key B and reencrypting the output
of that step with key A again.  Is this correct?  If so, this means one has
to deal with two keys...is there any way get the same level of security
with just one key?

This should be safe with 8 bits of pixel brightness.  The human eye can 
only detect about 50 gray scale levels.  You may also want to vary
the brightness over large regions instead of single pixels.  This is
because the eye is most sensitive to spacial frequencies of 0.1 to 0.2
degree, or a couple of pixels.

A better method (if you have color) is to substitute pixels of the
same brightness but different color.  The eye is not at all sensitive to
high frequency color variations.  (This is how NTSC was able to add
color to TV broadcasts without increasing bandwidth.  They use
3.5 MHz for black/white, 1.3 MHz for red/green, and 0.5 MHz for 
blue/yellow).

Be careful how you compute pixel brightness.  On an EGA/VGA monitor
(64 colors, 4 levels (2 bits) each of red, green, blue), the ratio
of red-green-blue brightness is about 2:4:1.  Also the actual brightness
varies non-linearly with pixel value, at about 0:1:4:9 for each of
the 4 levels.  Furthermore, the ratio changes as you adjust the
monitor brightness, to 1:2:5:10 (lighter) or 0:0:3:8 (darker).
This means that two pixels may or may not appear equally bright
depending on the monitor brightness setting.  (I got these
ratios experimentally).

I suspect that good lossy image compression will defeat all data
hiding techniques.  By design, they throw away what the eye can't see.

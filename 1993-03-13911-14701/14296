Untrue. Even silly with respect to Bidzos, since Lotus programmed Notes
independently of RSA, though under license.

But I can understand marc's concerns about things going on behind the scenes
in software that he feels he has no control over. That's why many in the
Unix crowd insist on sources. Others are willing to trust auditors and
even (good heavens!) the integrity of their vendors. Apparently a quarter
of a million users of Notes are satisfied, and one assumes those copies in
use for serious business in sophisticated corporations have been checked for
security. But if marc wants to roll his own under license, far be it from me
to deny him that fun.

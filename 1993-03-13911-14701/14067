Ever tried using haltoning or dithering as a security feature?

When done properly an 8-bit palette image can look almost the same as
the 24-bit original on a VDU, but it will have a very different
frequency spectrum because of all the high-frequency dithering or error
propagation components.  These can not only act as a signature but
also can foil most image processing techniques like interpolation,
compression, filtering, and so on.  A simple filter that removed all the
frequency signature of a particular dithering signal would also
remove a lot of the image detail.

There are some smart algorithms for descreening images, but none of them
are foolproof.  The paletting process is very non-linear, and so very
hard to reverse.

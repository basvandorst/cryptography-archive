      Hi,
What is currently the best/securest method of encryping of file for
which PD software is avalibale? What I want to do is encrypt a file
with a password that can be remembered (ie. it is not necesssary to
store it anywhere).  I am aware of PGP and the genereal idea of the
RSA algorithm, and I certainly see its usefullness in sending messages
and establishing secure communications, but it seems to me that its
major weakness is the length of the key (combined with the difficulty
of remembering it).

I am currently using PC SECURE V6.0 with its im DES implementation.
Is there a better & more secure algorithms / programs out there?

If this is a FAQ written up somewhere, please point me to a copy of
it.

Any emailed or posted replies would be appreciated. 

    - Henrik

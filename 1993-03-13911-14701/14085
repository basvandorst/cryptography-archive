	I don't have any sources on me at the moment.  But I believe
it to be true.  Even if it wasn't true, it would have been a good
technique since Navaho (I think) speakers are not generally found
outside of the United States.  I believe the corp of Native Americans
was a couple hundred men.
	This unknown language provided no means for the Japanese to
apply statistical methods based on common languages,  or even read
deciphered  text if the found it.  (They would think it a false
message or such.)

    As I wrote in an earlier posting in this thread, there is a
    commercial company (IBAS) in Norway that can do the stuff that
    Forrest is talking about. There is nothing you can do from software
    that will securely erase a disk. Everything that is ever written
    on it can potentially be restored. 

Hmmm.  I wonder if the Watergate tapes with the famous 18 minute
gap are still around.  Those were shown to have been erased
something like 10 times.  Maybe someone should send them to Norway?

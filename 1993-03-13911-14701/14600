The point is that there are easier ways to prove a number is not a prime,
than to actually give a factorization. For example, it is a fact that for
any prime number p  and any integer  x,  x^p = x  modulo p. So one (naive)
way to test a number N for compositeness would be to choose several
integers   x  at random and test whether or not   x^N = x  mod N. This is
much easier to do than factorization, and the "false witnesses" to this
test are rare -- if N passes this test just for x = 2,3,5,7 and 11 then
with high probability N  is a prime. To give you an idea of the success
rate, I think an old bound by Erdos on the density of composite solutions
to  2^N = 2 mod N  says that there are more *perfect squares* than false
witnesses  (= failure approx. once in 2^120 attempts, in the 256-bit
range).  And there more reliable methods to test for primes, such as
Miller-Rabin.  Since the prime number theorem guarantees an abundance of
primes, this means it's easy to generate probable primes of whatever size
you like.

Cnce you've got a suspected prime, you can run an algorithm (e.g.
Cohen-Lenstra based on class groups, or ECM) which will actually provide a
proof that it's prime, which is much faster than trying to factorize it.
In the same way that proving compositeness doesn't require a factorization,
one can give shorter proofs of primality than showing directly that all
numbers less than N are not factors.  I'm sure the experts on the net can
provide more accurate information, but what I heard is that proving
primality of numbers in the 1000-digit range is quite routine these days.

So I guess your question amounts to asking whether PGP proves that the
apparent primes that it generates are in fact primes.  I don't know, 
but surely one of the PGP users can post the answer.

I have a paper in Cryptologia (see ref below) where I implemented probabilistic
relaxation to solve monoalphabetic substitution ciphers at 90% plaintext letter resolution.  The paper includes partial code (for the compute likelihood vector,
update, and relaxation functions).  

In the paper I note the problems in trying to apply the method to homophonic
ciphers (lack of initialization formula, lack of constraint in ciphertext).

I'm finishing up a paper where I have extended the algorithm to solve periodic
polyalphabetic ciphers.  I'm solving Vigenere ciphers at 100% plaintext     
resolution and mixed cipher alphabets also at 100%.  This is for relatively
short ciphertext lengths of 200-400 of periods up to five or so and for
longer texts of 1200 or so of periods up to 20 or so.  I'm currently running
tests to wrap up the paper so these stats are preliminary and based only
on a couple of test cases.  

The code from the original paper was written in Pascal and ran on an business
machine.  Special functions had to take care of underflow and overflow so all
of this contributed to a CPU time of 13 minutes.  I've ported the code to C on
an HP9000 Series 710 workstation where it runs in under 20 seconds.

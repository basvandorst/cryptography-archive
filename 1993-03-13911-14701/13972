Decoding the encoded ZIP code beneath an address on an envelope.

Discard the first and last bars (guard bars) and group the remaining
into groups of 5 bars.  The leftmost 5 or 9 groups represent the 5 or 9 
digit ZIP code.  The last group is a check digit which, when added to 
the sum of the ZIP code digits, makes the sum evenly divisable by 10.

Letting the longer bars=1's and the shorter=0's, the leftmost four bits 
are the not quite binary code values and the rightmost bit is an even 
parity bit.  The groups decode as follows:

00011=1
00101=2
00110=3
01001=4
01010=5
01100=6
10001=7
10010=8
10100=9
11000=0

The following is the code for 98409-1130
1101001001001001110001010000011000110011011000010101

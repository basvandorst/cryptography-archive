	Most executables contain some kind of header that tells it where
the text and data areas are, etc, etc. (see a.out.h on UNIX) Some even
have a "magic number" that allows the kernel to check that a file is a
valid executable - that's all known plaintext. If you have something you
think is a UNIX executable, encrypted, you know you've decrypted it
successfully when the exec header structure at the beginning is valid.

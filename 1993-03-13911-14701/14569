How much money do you want to spend?  ;-)

Let's pick the Army Enigma.

3 rotors picked from a set of 5, and stacked on the axle. 
[60 possibilities]

26 possible positions for each rotor
[26^3 = 17576 possibilities]

Five pairs of letters swapped by the plugboard: choose ten letters,
pick an ordering of them, plug cable 1 into the first two, cable 2
into the second two etc.  But I could plug the cables in in any
permutation so I'm 5! times too big.  But the cables are bidirectional
so I'm 2 times too big.
[(26 choose 10) times 10! divided by (2*5!)  = 15120 cable settings.]

265749120 possible keys.

That's only 2^27.

Direct search of the Enigma keyspace is apparently feasible on modern
parallel computers.  Assuming I got (a) the number of cables right and
(b) got the number of possible cable-swaps right

This assumes unknown-plaintext!  With a known-plaintext attack we are
much luckier, and can do a bombe-type attack before searching the
plugboard space; this puts the Enigma in reach of a PC-XT.

Which isn't surprising, since the Enigma was in reach of people in the
1940s who just had electric motors and metal relays.

  I only have a general understanding from some of the articles that have
been published about modern crypto algorithms, but I am under the impression
that the difficulty of doing crypto with N-bit keys increases with N -much-
slower than the difficulty of breaking crypto done with N-bit keys.
  Thus, as the state of the art makes higher values of N practical, the
would-be breakers would tend to fall behind despite the fact that they have
access to the same technology.
  Or am I missing something basic?

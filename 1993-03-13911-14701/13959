	I posted initially to misc.consumers, and received two
replies... one recommended that I ask people in this group about it...
the other said that the algorithm was already posted sometime ago.
So, would some kind soul please repost (or mail me) the algorithm or
any other information available on the VCR Plus Codes.  The 900# is
kind of a pain, and since my parents tape the same stuff every week...
I can make them a list of what codes to program each week... or just
write a program to do it, and send it to them.  
	Thanks a lot!

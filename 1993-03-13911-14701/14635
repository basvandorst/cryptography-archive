And if I deal with ten entities needing PINs, do they all get a library
of my "familiar faces?"  The problem I see is that this mechanism, while
reasonable at stopping casual thiefs, won't catch somebody with knowledge
or access to knowledge about my life. Someone could simply take pictures
of a few people around me and use that as a key to access (I'm likely to
use common, rather than uncommon, faces, no?).

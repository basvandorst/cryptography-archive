Yes, you're right.  However, taking the raw IC on the whole ciphertext
doesn't give a good estimate of how many alphabets were actually used.
It's quite sensitive for distinguishing between one alphabet and many, but
once you get past 2 or 3, you're shooting in the dark, so the "period 22"
you suggest is meaningless.  As you guessed, I looked at the average IC
assuming N alphabets.  This <is> rather sensitive, because in each case
you're using it against a single alphabet.  For those who haven't run it,
here's what we're talking about:

	Period   2: average ic = 0.042306
	Period   3: average ic = 0.042722
	Period   4: average ic = 0.047312
	Period   5: average ic = 0.036145
	Period   6: average ic = 0.044653
	Period   7: average ic = 0.038049
---->   Period   8: average ic = 0.058185
	Period   9: average ic = 0.038258
	Period  10: average ic = 0.042890
	Period  11: average ic = 0.036915
	Period  12: average ic = 0.050673

Actually, 0.058 isn't up at the 0.066 you'd expect for standard English
text, but it's not uncommonly low for actual encountered text in this
small a sample.  And, as you say, it's the best of the periods shown.
It's not always the case that the highest value is the right period;
there's a constructed example in Helen F.  Gaines' "Elementary
Cryptanalysis" that was designed to peak in the wrong place, both with IC
and Kasiski.  However, usually it will indicate the right period.
However, you did catch me:  I overstated and should have said "suggests
the period is 8" instead of "shows the period is 8".

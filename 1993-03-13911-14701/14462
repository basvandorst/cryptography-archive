	I read a study way back in some mainframe rag about magnetic
tape wear. This was from back when they were dealing with big 1600bpi
reels. ;) The folks writing the article had the bright idea of putting
a magnet near the reel for a while and seeing what happened. Nothing.
Then they rubbed the magnet on the edges of the reel. Nothing. Data
was still intact. Finally, it turned out that the only way to get
any kind of errors was to rub a magnet directly on the surface of
the tape, just like a tape-head.

	Magnetic media's pretty stable stuff. That's part of the
design, so I'm not surprised. I regularly carry floppies through
the metal detectors at airports (hard disks, too) and I've never
lost a bit (that I've noticed).

	I can easily imagine how if you "erased" a tape with a pattern
of zeroes, someone could read back the data, based on faint hints of
where the ones *used* to be - with a little filtering I suspect you
could do a pretty good job. If the tape had been overwritten with
white noise a couple of times, I'd be a bit less concerned.

Hi,
this is the LaTeX-version of the documentation to the SFS (Secure FileSystem)
package by Peter Gutmann. Peter suggested that I upload it, so here it is...

If you have any comments/suggestions/criticism/flames, please direct them to
Peter Conrad (conrad@unix-ag.uni-kl.de), or to Peter Gutmann himself.

To build the dvi-file, enter:

make

if you have a decent make utility, of course. If you don't, you'll have
to enter:

latex sfs1.tex
latex sfs1.tex
latex sfs1.tex

Yes, three times, because latex has to get the cross-references right...

Have fun,
		Peter

þ PGPSort is a utility that will sort PGP public keyrings alphabetically.
  Alternatively, PGPSort can sort on key ID, key size or date of creation.
  PGPSort can sort in increasing and decreasing order, and it will work on
  both secret and public keyrings.

þ PGPSort uses QuickSort to sort the keys in main memory. In order to sort
  a keyring from an Internet public keyserver (2 Mb), you will need about
  400 Kb of conventional DOS memory. PGPSort does not support EMS or XMS.

þ To see a list of command line options for PGPSort, simply execute
  "PGPSORT" without any parameters.

þ PGPSort will always make a backup of the keyring before sorting it, but
  the author cannot take any responsibility for damage that the program
  may cause. Use PGPSort at your own risk. 

þ PGPSort is written in Borland Pascal 7.0 and so is limited to the MS-DOS
  environment. However, the PGP keyring format is the same for all platforms
  and PGPSort may be used for sorting keyrings generated by any PGP version.

þ PGPSort and its source code is released to the public domain. Feel free
  to modify the program to suit your own needs. The author may be contacted 
  at: staalesc@ifi.uio.no.

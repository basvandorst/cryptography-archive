Forgive me if this is a common question, but I just subscribed to this 
newsgroup.

I'm looking for a routine to scramble a text string in computer memory. I
picture a string input being scrambled, in order to avoid the possibility 
for someone to search this memory and find the string. I suppose crypt() 
has this functionality, but according to my information, crypt() cannot be 
used in Europe for some reason. Are there any alternatives to crypt() 
available, either as a commercial product or in freeware/shareware format?

Please reply to the email address below.

Cheers,

Can anyone recommend an ICV algorithm that:
1) can produce a 32-bit ICV
2) has about the same computational complexity as a table driven CRC-32
function
3) has about the same error detection properties as CRC-32
4) is (obviously) a non-linear function of the data to be ICV'd, then
encrypted

Any and all replies (along with references if possible) are appreciated.

I know about it.

after 1920 are used, with simple substitution being the most common.

    (This magazine may cease publication but back issues are available.)
Magazine devoted to public key cryptography, especially amoungst
personal computer owners.  [Note that RSA's patents do not apply in
Europe, hence the existence of this magazine.]

IEEE Transactions on Information Theory.
(Address and price not handy at the moment.)

Not a crypto journal, of course, but occasionally contains articles of
major cryptologic significance.

devoted to cryptography.  Back issues are available.


Infosecurity News
MIS Training Institute Press, Inc.
498 Concord Street
Framingham MA   01701-2357

Nominally $40/year (6 issues), but free to "qualified" subscribers.
This trade journal is oriented toward administrators and covers
viruses, physical security, hackers, and so on more than cryptology.
Furthermore, most of the articles are written by vendors and hence
are biased.  Nevertheless, there are occasionally some rather good 
crypto articles.

As part of the ongoing "who broke Enigma" debate, the accuracy of W.
Stevenson's "Intrepid's Last Case" is questioned.  Ebright cites Sharp 
(and so on), as follows:

By chance I have a copy of a book by Nigel West at hand, "A Thread of Deceit,
Espionage Myths of World War II", Random House, 1985, ISBN 0-394-53941-9,
who has a lot to say about the accuracy of Stevenson's writing:  invention
of evidence, misrepresentation of evidence, falsehoods.  On page 141, West
catches Stevenson inventing an interrogation of Allan Nunn May by William
Skardon, described by Stevenson as having "developed his style during
wartime interrogation of Nazis ans captured German commanders.  U-boat
captains, in particular, were disarmed by the man's concern to offer no 
discourtesy".  But this is fiction, says West:  Skardon says he never met
a U-boat commander in his life, and never interrogated May.  West says that
Stevenson's general method is to invent false stories about deceased persons
(who are thus unable to refute them) and in this instance slipped up: Skardon
was not dead.  West gives many more instances of Stevenson's mendacity.
The most amusing ones are in "A Man Called Intrepid", where a bunch of
stills from the movie "School for Danger" are passed off as real photos of
real spies, Czech resistance fighters, etc.

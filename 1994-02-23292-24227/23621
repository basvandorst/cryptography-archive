I read recently that the Commerce Dept. recertified DES... I 
don't recall the exact date on this, but I think it was last 
December.  Could someone tell me if what was recertified was the 
same DES as in the original, circa 1977, version?  I had heard 
that some plans were in the works for a 128-bit key version and 
possibly some other enhancements, but I never did hear what the 
actual recertification applied to.  Thanks for any info.

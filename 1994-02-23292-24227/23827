Regarding the verification, I believe most (if not all?) credit
cards use the following formula (developed by IBM).
 
(I hope this doesn't end up too confusing)
 
Ok, say your card number is: 312-5600-196-431-2.
 
(1) Add every other digit (odd numbered positions) and double
    the result. So (3+2+6+0+9+4+1) X 2 = 50.

(2) Count the number of digits in that same set that exceed "4",
    and add that to the total. (In this case 2 numbers exceed 4,
    so the current total is now 52.

(3) Now add the sum of all uncounted digits (except the last
    digit on the card) to your previous total.
    (1+5+0+1+6+3) + (52) = 68.

(4) The last digit of any credit card number is always the 
    difference between the product of this formula (68) and the
    next highest number ending in zero (70); in this case "2".

If the formula total and the final digit don't add up to something
ending in zero then you know that the credit card number is not
valid.

This formula works regardless of the number of digits in the credit
card, just include the extra digits in the first two calculations.

Hope this helps...

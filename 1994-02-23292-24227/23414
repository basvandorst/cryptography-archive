Steve:

The best case I know of was the series of widespread packet-snooping
attacks that rippled like dominoes throughout the Internet snatching
passwords last October. I am quoting Thor Simon of panix.com here,
from an alert posted 19 October, 1993:


[from tls@panix.com]

 compromised in 2 days by a renegade with stolen root
 privileges that had corrupted /dev/nit to snatch packets
 on a Sun machine at panix.com]

Very shortly thereafter, CERT was posting messages on the
net saying how they regret that the names of the compromised
sites were released on the net and explaining that it is not
their policy to publicize incidents of this type, which may
help to explain why we don't hear about these things all the
time in spite of information such as the following, which
I snagged several days later:

It may have done just that, too, because I also snagged
this the day after Panix went public with the attack:

If I were you, I'd try to contact alexis@panix.com to ask
for experienced views on packet snatching. I bet you get an
informed, authoritative earfull!

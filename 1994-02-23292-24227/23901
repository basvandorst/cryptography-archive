Not the smallest, but the SECOND LARGEST.

This last sentence is meaningless. What do you mean by "give you anything
interesting"?

I suggest you look up Dickman's function. You can find a discussion of it
in Knuth Vol. 2.

You might also look at

An arbitrary integer N has  ~ log log n prime factors. It does not
matter how many small prime factors it has. What is relevent is the 
size of the second largest prime factor. 
 
What makes a random integer N easier to factor than M = pq (p, q nearly
equal)  where M is about the same size as N  is the fact that one
can probably pull out some relatively small factors of N fairly
easily. What is left may be prime or the product of only large primes.
One then applies the same method one uses to factor M, but since we
have pulled out some small factors, the cofactor of N is now SMALLER
than M.

He is a doting old fool (>60, as I recall) who grew up in the 
J. Edgar Hoover era where government did no wrong and who at one
time apparently was a respected authority in his field.  Now in the 
twilight of his life, he is trying to salvage some dignity while
trying to pretend that it is still the "old days" by shilling for the 
government.  His continued groveling at the feet of his former
masters in the US government only serves to further embarras him.
The wise in this world realize that there is a time to step back and
leave the world to the next generation.  Others such as sternlight,
grasp for the straws of what used to be.  Sad, very sad.  Particularly
sad for me since I was raised to respect the elderly.

The best solution to the problem is simply to killfile him and be
done with it.

John

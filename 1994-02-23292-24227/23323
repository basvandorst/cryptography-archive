Just to follow up on this...

I have been contacted by several persons, including Philip Zimmermann (sorry
about the mis-spelling in the previous post) about the irresposnsibilty of
my post, and the inscendiary nature of not checking my facts before posting
to the net.

I would like to publicly apologize to the entire sci.crypt and Usenet
comunity for spreding baseless rumors about the integrity of PGP and its
creator, Philip Zimmermann.

There have never been, nor is there now ANY BACK DOOR in PGP.  Period.  Any
rumor which suggests that there is, is totally false and detrimental to the
PGP using community as a whole.

I apologize sincerely to Mr. Zimmermann for indirectly insinuating that his
personal integrity had been comrpomised by any government agency.  It was
irrespsonsible of me to not check my facts before posting to the community
as a whole.

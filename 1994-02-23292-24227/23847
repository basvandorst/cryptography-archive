In an attempt to do defense conversion, LMSC has decided to build a
commercial remote sensing system.  Due to the cost, the "suits" want to
have data security (encryption) on all transmissions.  This means either
using space qualified data security hardware or using a space qualified
processor.  I know where to find processors and DES algorithms. To do an
trade, I need to know what is available in commercial space qual or "near"
space qual range hardware.

So I came to the experts, You all.

Thanks for your help.

   Does anyone have a public source for the encryption function that Unix uses

   password, and spit out the same syndrome that appears in /etc/passwd files.

   Can anyone help me out?


Seek out Crack by Alec Muffett, assisted by a cast of dozens.  If you
can't get it locally, anon-ftp from black.ox.ac.uk (129.67.1.165) in
/src/security/crack41.tar.Z

It's also available on the first edition of DEC's Ultrix Freeware
CD-ROM 8-)

Nice one, DEC.

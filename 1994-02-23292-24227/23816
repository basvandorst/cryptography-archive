August 21--25, 1994, Santa Barbara, California\\[0.35cm]
{\Large\bf CALL FOR PAPERS}
\end{center}
\paragraph*{General Information}
Crypto~'94, the Fourteenth Annual {\bf Crypto} Conference, is organized by the
International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR), in cooperation with
the IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Security and Privacy, and the
Computer Science Department of the University of California. Original papers
are solicited on all aspects of cryptology.
%
\paragraph*{Topics of Interest}
The topics of interest include but are not limited too:

\paragraph*{Instructions for Authors}
Send a cover letter, one title page and 15~copies of an extended abstract to
be received by March~4, 1994, (or postmarked by February~23, 1994 and sent via
airmail) to the Program Chair at the address given below. The title page
should contain the title, the name of the authors, their postal and
{\bf e-mail}
addresses and the abstract. The extended abstract should start with the title
and the abstract, but should be {\bf anonymous}. This should be followed by a
succinct statement appropriate for a non-specialist reader specifying the
subject addressed, its background, the main achievements, and their
significance to cryptology. Technical details directed to the specialist should
then follow. A limit of 10~singlespaced pages of 12pt type (not counting the
bibliography and clearly marked appendices) is placed on all submissions.
Since referees are not required to read the appendices, the paper should be
intelligible without them.

Abstracts that have been or will be submitted in parallel to other conferences
or workshops that have proceedings are {\bf not} eligible for submission
to Crypto. The authors must state compliance to this rule in their cover
letter. A \LaTeX{}
style file and an example of a cover letter will be available after January~1,
by sending e-mail to statuscrypto94@csd4.csd.uwm.edu
%
\paragraph*{Conference Proceedings}
Crypto~'94 will be the first Crypto conference where {\bf proceedings will be
available at the meeting}. These proceedings will be published in the Springer
Verlag's Lecture Notes in Computer Science. Clear instructions about the
final copy will be sent to authors of accepted papers. The final copies of
the accepted papers will be due on June~8, 1994. Final papers arriving too
late will be {\it removed from the main program}.
Authors of accepted papers must guarantee that their
paper will be presented at the conference.

A limited number of stipends are available to those unable to obtain funding
to attend the conference. Students whose papers are accepted and who will
present the paper themselves are encouraged to apply if such assistance is
needed. Requests for stipends should be addresses to the general chair.

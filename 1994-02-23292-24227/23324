Subject: PGP Rumor Mill
Date: Mon, 31 Jan 1994 17:34:12 GMT

I was at a gathering this past weekend and a friend of mine swore up and
down that Phill Zimmerman sold out to the feds and put in a back door to
versions of PGP that are currently out on the net.  She cited an article in
_Wired_ as the source of this rumor.

My copy of _Wired_ with this supposed article has grown legs and walked
off.  Could some kind soul please tell me that this is a joke?

In the event that it isn't a joke, please tell me which versions have not
been compromised.

I realize that just about any post about PGP to sci.crypt is incendiary in
nature; I apologize for any ensuing flame-fest.

tia,

Ya gotta be kidding.  I've read every issue of Wired, cover to cover
(yes, I admit it), and it's ridiculous.  Have your friend show you
the article, and post it if she can.  I'm saying this because I think
Wired is one of the few mags out there with a clue.

Check the source.  Talk to some crypto-academics, mathematicians, 
programmers into crypto, etc.  If there *is* a back door in PGP, they
would be the ones to know about it.  Read the docs and the FAQs.

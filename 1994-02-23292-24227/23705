December, 1993.  I wrote it, and I'm a little embarassed, as it's
not the most recent, it's not the cleanest, and it was ripped
from PGP 2.2, so things like the random-number generator are
included, but usuals.h is not.  (Although you can probably
figure out what a word16 typedef is supposed to be.)

I have sent some cleaner code to Bruce Schneier for his Applied
Cryptography disks, which is designed for exposition as well
as efficiency (including 68000 and 8086 assembler
implementations which are designed for excessive speed), and
is also in the public domain.  You might want to get your hands
on that.

(I am not presently willing to distribute it directly myself,
but surely lots of people here on sci.crypt must have the AC disks.)

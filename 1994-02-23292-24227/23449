As I understand the discussions here over the past several months, the
government does use a Skipjack-class algorithm for classified traffic. The
details are different (perhaps only the equivalent of the S-boxes--dunno),
but the basic approach is the same.

It's simple prudence to use many different forms of a crypto approach for
different subject areas. This is called "compartmentation" and is intended
that if any one compartment is breached it won't vitiate the others. As far
as I know there is no evidence for the assertion that Skipjack is good
enough for us but not (as a class of algorithm) good enough for the
government.

In fact, even the specific Skipjack implementation is apparently good enough
for those aspects of government communications that require privacy though
not national security. That's what they say THEY're buying all those chips
for.

Finally, protecting material whose disclosure might put the population at
risk is simply of higher importance than protecting material that might put
one individual at risk, and I would hope the government would use much more
secure approaches (even if more costly) to the former than to the latter.

Quite a while back, back when the U.S.S.R. was still together, I read
that Soviet cosmonauts used CW transmissions ("Morse code") to communicate
with ground stations.  Apparently this was to thwart monitoring by the
public, because it was said that they used voice transmission when over
unpopulated areas and CW over populated areas.

To further discourage monitoring, they used a special CW code, not the
standard transliteration of the Cyrillic alphabet into international
morse, or so it was claimed.

Now that we have Russians and other former Soviets on the 'Net, is there
anyone out there who is familiar with the Soviet space CW code?  Has the
breakup of the Soviet Union caused it to become unclassified?  Do you have
a crib sheet for it?

Thanks for any help.

Lynn

Can't we call on information theory here?  Say I write my super-secret
password to one disk block and later want to erase it.  I run a
procedure such as Colin described on my workstation overnight.  The
block gets re-written about 10**5 times with random garbage, blocks
from /usr/dict/words, whatever.  Then the feds come, confiscate the
disk and perform some alchemy to extract the password.

Either that one operation that wrote the password was somehow
different from all the previous and subsequent writes to that block,
or we must assume that everything ever written there (at least since
its use for the password) can be recovered.

a) I don't believe it
b) You still have to figure out which recovered block represents the
   password.

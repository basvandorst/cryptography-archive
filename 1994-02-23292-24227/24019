It seems to me that this shows rather that it is where you start
looking, not the SIZE of the factors that determines how 'easy'
factoring is.

If you always check primes starting at 1, and iterating upwards from
there then you will always find the smaller primes first. If you
expect large primes, then by starting instead at some large prime,
you might get just as lucky and find your factor quickly.

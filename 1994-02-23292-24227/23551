I have several other articles which describe (some in extreme
mathematical detail) the structure of many of the most common PN sequence
generators and how to crack them.  However, the most commond generators
are not (from my limited experience) used in crypto systems since there
are much more secure PN sequence generators, some especially designed
for crypto.

I can provide references if anyone is interested.

Does anyone have references that they could post??  We could trade.

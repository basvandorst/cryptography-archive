   Earlier traffic on this newsgroup.

I don't remember key lengths being discussed much, though;
something that has a different key length is probably rather different
in strength, or at least in the amount of testing put into its S-boxes
and key scheduling.

   The White House has said it doesn't, and I am not prepared to call them
   liars. If you are, without specific evidence, that's a position for which
   you must bear any personal onus.

The SkipJack algorithm doesn't need a trapdoor, because the Clipper
chip provides one, and the key loading process provides several more.
And I don't remember the Denning gang's interim report saying that
LEAF-Creation-Method 1 didn't have any holes, or that the Black Box
given to cops didn't have any (since it supposedly wasn't really
designed yet.)  LCM-1 is a great place to put leaks.

So the politicians don't need to lie, because they can misdirect.

   Come on, Steve, you know better than that. "Security by obscurity" refers to
   concealing an algorithm, not compartmentization.

LCM-1 *is* concealed, as is SkipJack, though SKipJack is probably ok.

There are several valid reasons for them not to use it for classified info.
One is that, to impersonate someone over the phone and social-engineer
classified data out of them, if the dupe is using a Clipperphone,
you only need another Clipperphone.  Instead, you need to get a STU-III,
which has a classified-design keying system and keying authenticator
dongles that only allow specific classification levels, so it's harder
to pretend to be authorized.  (They *could* build the same sort of
thing out of CLipperphones, since Clipper doesn't specifiy how keying
is done, and it would have the same effect, though.)
Another is that the NSA takes need-to-know seriously, and you'd have
to make sure that the chip keys really *were* escrowed, by properly
cleared people authorized by the owners, instead of being piled along
with all the easily-subpoenaed keys which canbe obtained by bribing a
prosecutor and a judge or two into helping you do a wiretap.
After all, a CIA agent *acts* a lot like a drug dealer at times :-)

   Not in this country. The government is charged under a number of laws
   including the Full Employment Act of 1947 to look after the economic
   interests of this country's private sector. What do you think the Federal
   Reserve is all about as a Macroeconomic Policy organization? What do you
   think many Federal economic stimulus and labor adjustment programs are all
   about. It is within the purview of government to offer systems for the
   protection of the private sector--in this case voluntary.

He said "properly".  He didn't say "has decided it wants to".  
My private business is *my* private business,about which I properly
make decisions, and the government's meddling in that is improper no
matter *what* it's charged itself with.

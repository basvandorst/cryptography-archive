	What on earth are you talking about?  Factoring numbers that have only
two factors isn't any different than factoring ones that have three, four, 
five, or a billion factors.  It makes no difference at all how many factors
a number has, only the size of the smallest factor and the size of the number
itself (big numbers are generally harder to factor because they tend to have
larger factors).

	If you're talking about *random* integers, then factoring N=p*q would,
in general, be MUCH harder to factor. A random number, no matter what size,
has a 50% chance of being even, 33% chance of being a multiple of 3, 20% chance
of being divisible by 5, etc... Simply picking numbers at random will almost
never give you anything interesting in the way of factors... most of the
factors will tend to be small, and thus found very quickly.

	The factoring algorithm of which they speak is one that would factor
*any* number, and so factoring N=p*q would be a trivial consequence of this
theory.

i'd recommend checking out IDEA. IDEA is from switzerland, and though it's
patented, you can use it for free for non-commercial applications. IDEA
encrypts and decrypts in 8 byte chunks. you could construct a stream-
oriented IDEA cipher by encrypting a block consisting of a concatenation
of the character to be transmitted, 4 bytes of timestamp, and 3 random
bytes. grab the source code for PGP from the UK or something; someone
should be able to give you a pointer (i can't remember the name of the
machine to ftp to).

good luck, and let us know how the project goes!

As I see it, it all depends on how _well_ he understood the ancient
scribe.  If he understood him by mental telepathy, or if reading
the manuscript inspired a knowledge of the truth in him, then the
decipherment is ok.  If he took the risks of mistaking coincidence
for decipherment that the authorities claim are part of ordinary
reading and decryption, then the solution is bogus.  In my opinion,
the former situation will seldom seem probable
except to mystics or near-mystics.

Such people may have something to contribute to this group, but
a certain lack of enthusiasm in the replies is likely (!).

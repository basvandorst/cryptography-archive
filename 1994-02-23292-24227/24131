Ok-I've read the FAQ and I didn't notice anything about this.  I realize
that RSA works on the idea that we have 2 primes, p and q and that we
multiply them, and their product is the product of the two primes only. 
However, what makes it so hard to break is the running time of the prime
factorization algorhithm-i.e. is it in NP? 

Then how can we know if P and Q are prime since it would take so long to
find them?  I realize that when you multiply P and Q that the product is
going to be quite a bit bigger than P and Q, but still.....

Thanks

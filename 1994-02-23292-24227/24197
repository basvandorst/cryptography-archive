Hmmmm...

A difficulty I have is that many (including the sci.crypt FAQ) have a 
fixation on the radiation from CRTs. That's only one part of a much larger 
problem as some try to point out from time to time. 

In an active 
circuit, all wires and all components produce electromagnetic fields and 
either the electrical or magnetic components of these fields may be exploited 
to recover information. Information may also be recovered by the exploitation 
of electrostatic effects. Some information recovery techniques may be less than
straightforward and not generally known. 

Without a very good understanding of these recovery techniques it is 
impossible to judge whether or not any particular standard is worth much 
more than the paper its written on.  

'TEMPEST' related commercial standards will be classified for one of three 
reasons:
		a. To protect information on the potential to exploit a wide 
variety of electromagnetic and electrostatic phenomena.
		b. To conceal the relative paucity of the protection afforded 
by said standards.
		c. Both the above.

You pays your money and takes your choice :-)

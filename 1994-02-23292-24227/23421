Hi there...
 
Does anyone have, or know where I can find the following:
 
msdos executables of MD5, IDEA, and ultra fast crypt.
 
I know all the source is readily available, but I lack a 
compiler and knowledge of 'C'. (Yeah, thats next weeks project)
 
If anyone has any of them sitting around, I'd appreciate some
uuencoded mail, thanx.

Imagine I`m looking for a Direct-Sequence SS signal on a defined center
frequency.  How can I be sure that the increase in the noise level is the
consequence of a SS signal ?  And if there is any method detecting such
signal, can I find the direction / location of the transmitter?

Thanx in advance

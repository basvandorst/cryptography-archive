If they keep their word, they can't tap your line until they already have a
court order. Thus they won't have access to any traffic prior to the court
order. That's easily checked in any legal proceeding against you, so they
wouldn't even try. 

In other words, they need evidence other than your past "broken" traffic to
get the court order in the first place, and even if they cheat and have
prior traffic, they can't use it in court since it would amount to a guilty
plea of violating the wiretap laws and the evidence would also be
suppressable.

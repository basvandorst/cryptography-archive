There was an article in Cryptologia a few years ago (please don't ask
my fading memory which issue) on this that may help.  It said in sum
that Stimson had no principled objections to this kind of intelligence.
He thought it was dirty, but had to be done.  His objection was to
"gentlemen" doing it.  That is, the State Department was gentlemen.
The military was not.  Therefore the State Department should not
be doing it (the American Black Chamber was a State Department baby),
it was more suitable for the military.

He had some funny notions.

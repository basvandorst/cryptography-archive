We are considering producing a CD-ROM with multiple products,
each with their own encryption key.  If the end user wants a
particular product, he would have to pay us for the key.

However, since our product will be shipped throughout the world,
I don't want to get into trouble with the CIA.  I really just
need something to discourage most people from attempting to crack
the code.

Ideally, I would like three decryption keys, a local key, a
sub-master key, and a master key.  The local key would only
work for one product, the sub-master key would decode all
products on the CD-ROM, and the master key would work for all
CD-ROMs we might potentally produce.

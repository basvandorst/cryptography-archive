   True, but only if you expect the chip to talk to Clipper. If Hitachi (for instance) comes up with a chip at half the price that talks to others
   of the same type (using a published algorithm) they could take the market 
   before Clipper gets going.

Not if the Feds convince the cellphone makers to use Clipper instead;
that's one of the largest markets for secure communications,
and the FCC's lock on the licensing market gives them some extra
arm-twisting leverage.

   And banning it's import could be considered a breach of GATT.

I would have guessed that GATT has some loopholes for munitions.
On the other hand, with Clinton busy yelping about the Japanese
market's resistance to Motorola cellphones, he may be in a weaker
position if he tries to push a system that can't easily be made outside the US,
or if he blocks sales of competing Japanese phones...n

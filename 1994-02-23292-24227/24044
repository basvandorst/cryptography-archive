Why not use your government-approved Clipper boxes to encrypt the data
stream coming out of whatever encryption you trust?  Then the stuff
looks like Clipper when it's on the wire, in case the government wants
to regard any non Clipper crypto traffic as probable cause, but if the
government use their backdoor all they've got is the IDEA / PGP /
one-time / whatever ciphertext.

Hmmm, just as a sidenote. The CryPt Newsletter, a few issues back, featured a
program to 'hide' information within a graphics format. Of course, if you know
where to look you can find it. Is this any different with Stealth-PGP?

I'm afraid I missed the original posting.
Or is the trick that they can't prove it's anything other than noise? ;)

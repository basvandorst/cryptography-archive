You've made it clear, Jim, that you've got a hair up your
ass with respect to spooks.

I seem to recall the last time you and I were debating the role
of NSA in commercial cryptography development, I made
several points you were unable or unwilling to counter, so you got 
all flustered, announced you were putting me in your killfile, and
wouldn't continue the debate -- either on-line or vias email --
despite the fact that myself and many others would like to hear 
what you have to say, given your background and knowledge.

So about spooks.  I think if we're going to debate the topic,
we do have some obligation to better understand them.  
I don't think you can responsibly advocate "shut them down"
unless you understand them to the same degree that you
would need to propose to "modify their actions", or change their 
charter, or whatever.

Steve

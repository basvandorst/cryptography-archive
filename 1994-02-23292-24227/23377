	Hmmm.  Although I am new to this forum and this is the first
contribution I've made, I thought I'd throw this out...
	Texas Instruments makes an evaluation board featuring one of their
tms320c26 processors, voice-grade digitizer, and voice-grade "undigitizer".
(is that the right word?)  The board is about $100, pretty cheap for a DSP
starter kit.
	In Volume One of their DSP applications appeared an article on how
to implement DES on-the-fly with one of the tms320 series processors.  It
seems like it would be kinda neat to get a couple of those things and use
them for secure telephone.  I don't know if the serial ports on the board
will spit the data out and suck it in fast enough, but a freind of mine
tells me that they're quick - perhaps quick enough.
	What you'd need to be able to to for phone would be around 48K bips,
I would think.  The phone company uses 56K.
	Well that's enough for now.  I am also looking into this.  Reply
if you have any interesting ideas, ignore if you've already considered all
of this.

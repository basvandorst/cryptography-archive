I received several solutions on this problem.
Suggestions included 
   .converting values to double and doing the multiplication
   .take logoarithms, add them and then compare.
   .carry out integer mutiplication in smaller chunks.
   .doing recursive calculation (integer arithmetic but may be much slower
    than double-precision calculation)

Thanks for the solutions

I think:
1) This patent wont last very long if any large corporation needs to make 
money on the idea, as it's easily shot down as idea which is obvious to a
person versed in the field by a competent patent attorney.

2) It would work be self defeating to adopt this approach in any pattern 
space containing regions dense in targets with small spaces between them.

Enjoy.

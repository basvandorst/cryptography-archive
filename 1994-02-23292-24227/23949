	One caveat: that ruling predates an act of Congress that
makes monitoring of some kinds of radio illegal.  The Supreme Court
would probably allow the restriction (after all, the federal

	Different issue entirely: what's illegal is OPERATING a radar
detector in a motor vehicle.  It's part of the traffic code...
Every policeman who uses a radar speed gun is operating a radar

[some snipping]
An article in _Cryptologia_ a few years ago (sorry, don't recall which
issue) mentioned one example that is my favorite.  In WW II, many
German officers reported "lage unveraendert" (situation unchanged).
It was a very common message.  It just so happens that the Enigma
cannot encipher a letter to itself.  So, Bletchley Park looked for
16 letter messages, the 1st letter of which was not an L, the 2nd
letter not an A, and so on.  It was an excellent guess that a
message that fit the constraints was "lage unveraendert".

This is known plaintext and ciphertext.  It was enough to recover the
rotor settings.

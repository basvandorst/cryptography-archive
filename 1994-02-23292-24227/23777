ACF2 can be certified to Orange-Book standards (B1 istr).

An authorised progam is required to come from an authorised library. It is 
quite possible to write an authorised program that will authorise 
non-authorised programs. This is usually done using an SVC - a system 
routine. In IBM land an authorised program is one which is able to use 
restricted system services. This authorisation hangs on one bit in a 
protected memory location. You need to be authorised to change this bit, but 
an SVC will do it for you. There are plenty of published examples around of 
this. Any Sys prog could write such an SVC.

ACF2 is good, but (I think) like RACF a lot of file security profiles are 
held in storage for speed. If you can run authorised you could technically 
change these profiles. You would only need to disable logging and enable 
read access. You could then read the VTOC to build an extent list of wheret 
the file resides on disk. Finally, you could write a channel program which 
would allow you to access this area of disk - providing you had read access 
to the disk itself.

FWIW I am a  fully trained systems programmer with a good ASM knowledge and 
MVS systems knowledge. A good systems programmer can program systems. If a 
sys prog _really_ wants to read some data, he probably can. However, the 
work to do this is non-trivial and will leave an audit trail a mile wide (if 
you look carefully) - Certainly one large enough to prove _who_. Of course 
you can change your ACF2 logonID in ACF2 (and therefore be some  else 
temporarily) if you are a sysprog and run authorised and know what you are 
doing. 

It is vital to remember that ACF2 and RACF are both built onto systems in a 
similar way to the way DBLSPACE is bolted onto DOS. It is not a perfect fit. 
You can load RACF/ACF2 to run in a security mode where every access is 
queried. You can also write a systems routine to reply yes to every query 
and a third routine to suppress the messages generated on the console...

So, in summary, I deeply uneasy with the 'impossible' claim for the 
prosecution. It is technically possible and the skills are readily 
available. The only defence is the quality of your staff and procedures.

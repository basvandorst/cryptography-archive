Hi, I have some simple questions about RSA:

What does _relatively_ prime mean?

1 mod? I thought mod was the 'remainder' of a division?

My view:
1 mod x equals the remainder after the division. In my
universe, any integer can be divided by 1 without a remainder. I would say 1
mod x = 0. And since ed = 1 mod x, ed = 0 which is only true if one (or both)
exponent is zero.

Apparently, this multiplicative inverse stuff is beyond me.

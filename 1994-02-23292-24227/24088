Electronic Frontier Foundation Statement on FBI Draft Digital Telephony
Bill 

EFF has received a draft of the FBI's new, proposed "Digital Telephony"
bill. After initial analysis, we strongly condemn bill, which would
require all common carriers to construct their networks to deliver to law
enforcement agencies, in real time, both the contents of all
communications on their networks and the "signalling" or transactional
information. 

In short, the bill lays the groundwork for turning the National
Information Infrastructure into a nation-wide surveillance system, to be
used by law enforcement with few technical or legal safeguards. This
image is not hyperbole, but a real assessment of the power of the
technology and inadequacy of current legal and technical privacy
protections for users of communications networks. 

Although the FBI suggests that the bill is primarily designed to maintain
status quo wiretap capability in the face of technological changes, in
fact, it seeks vast new surveillance and monitoring tools. Among the new
powers given to law enforcement are: 

1. Real-time access to transactional information creates the ability to
monitor individuals in real time. 

The bill would require common carrier network (telephone companies and
anyone who plans to get into the telephone business, such as cable TV
companies) to deliver, in real time, so called "call setup information."
In the simplest case, call setup information is a list of phone numbers
dialed by a given telephone currently under surveillance. As we all come
to use electronic communications for more and more purposes, however,
this simple call setup information could also reveal what movies we've
order, which online information services we've connected to, which
political bulletin boards we've dialed, etc. With increasing use of
telecommunications, this simple transactional information reveals almost
as much about our private lives as would be learned if someone literally
followed us around on the street, watching our every move. 

We are all especially vulnerable to this kind of surveillance, because,
unlike wiretapping the *content* of our communications, it is quite easy
for law enforcement to get permission to obtain this transactional
information. Whereas courts scrutinize wiretap requests very carefully,
authorizations for access to call setup information are routinely granted
with no substantive review. Some federal agencies, such as the IRS, even
have the power to issue administrative subpoenas on their own, without
appearing before a court. 

The real impact of the FBI proposal turns, in part, on the fact that it
is easy to obtain court approval for seizing transactional data. 

The change from existing law contained in the FBI proposal is that
carriers would have to deliver this call setup information *in real
time*, directly to a remote listening post designated by law enforcement.
Today, the government can obtain this information, but generally has to
install a device (called a 'pen register') which is monitored manually at
the telephone company switching office. 

2. Access to communication and signalling information for any mobile
communication, regardless of location allows tracking of an individual's
movements. 

The bill requires that carriers be able to deliver either the contents or
transactional information associated with any subscriber, even if that
person is moving around from place to place with a cellular or PCS phone.
It is conceivable that law enforcement could use the signalling
information to identify that location of a target, whether that person is
the subject of a wiretap order, or merely a subpoena for call setup
information. 

This provision takes a major step beyond current law in that it allows
for a tap and/or trace on a *person*, as opposed to mere surveillance of
a telephone line. 

3. Expanded access to electronic communications services, such as the
Internet, online information services, and BBSs. 

The privacy of electronic communications services such as electronic mail
is also put at grave risk. Today, a court order is required under the
Electronic Communications Privacy Act to obtain the contents of
electronic mail, for example. Those ECPA provisions would still apply for
the contents of such messages, but the FBI bill suggests that common
carriers might be responsible for delivering the addressing information
associated with electronic mail and other electronic communications. For
example, if a user connects to the Internet over local telephone lines,
law enforcement might be able to demand from the telephone company
information about where the user sent messages, and into which remote
systems that user connects. All of this information could be obtained by
law enforcement without every receiving a wiretap order. 

4. The power to shut down non-compliant networks 

Finally, the bill proposes that the Attorney General have the power to
shut down any common carrier service that fails to comply with all of
these requirements. Some have already called this the "war powers"
provision. Granting the Department of Justice such control over our
nation's communications infrastructure is a serious threat to our First
Amendment right to send and receive information, free from undue
government intrusion.

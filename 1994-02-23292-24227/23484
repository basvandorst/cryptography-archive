Another piece that might be interesting is:

	"Combinatorially Based Cryptography for Children (And Adults)"

by Michael Fellows and Neal Koblitz.  It's available as technical report
DCS-213-IR from the Department of Computer Science at the University of
Victoria, Victoria, B.C., Canada.

The authors talk about introducing various topics in discrete math and
computing using cryptography.  Some of it is based on work involving 
teaching school children in developing nations.

Subject: GSM A5 algorithm question...
Lines: 39


Reference the A5 crypto algorithm used in the European GSM
cellular phone system.
 
It seems that the algorithm uses a kind of a public-key scheme. 
Is it RSA? Is the system protected against traffic analysis?
 
The GSM smartcards used by the phones are generated for me
by the phone company. Do this mean the phone company keep my
secret key and may release it to the authorities in case 
of a wiretap? Just how secure is really the A5 algorithm?
And just how is the crippled version of the A5 crippled?
 
Could the A5 algorithm be used for other digital communication
like ISDN, to block out Clipper/Capstone from Europe?
(American crypto dominance is considered a threat to national
security by some western European countries.)
 
Any and all other interesting info on the A5 algorithm can be
e-mailed to me, anonymously and encrypted if needed.

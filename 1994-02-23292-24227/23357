If I connect the raw pulses to a bit on a PC parallel port so that
I can test the raw bits, I have a wide variety of tests that I 
can apply in software to the nuclear detector to ensure it is
working properly.  If the detector system produces one pulse per 
event, no more than one pulse per event, suffers no excessive
dead time, and maintains a consistent countrate, I know the nuclear
part is working right and that if I munge the bits correctly, the
stream will be random.  As important, I can perform the quality
tests in parallel and in real time with the random number generation
if I'm clever.

With a thermal noise generator, on the other hand, I don't know the
appropriate tests to validate the raw generator.  Does it take pure
white noise or will pink noise do?  What noise bandwidth is 
required?  And how do I measure this?  How about less than random 
noise sources such as popcorn noise?  How about subtle resonances
in the electronics?  I have a pretty good idea to design against
these problems but I don't know how to test how good a job I've
done until the final bits are in and then only after the 
fact.

Since the nuclear detector quality tests are sensitive and can be 
implemented to be go-no-go, it seems to me that it would be easier
for the serious amateur to build a high quality, reliable RNG.

The ECPA of 1987 (available from ftp.eff.org) criminalizes *monitoring*
of certain transmissions (other than for test purposes). Some of
these include, cellular, mobile telephones, encrypted communications,
the list goes on.

Most people believe that this part of the law was passed at the behest of
cellular companies wanting to promise the public 'privacy' without
actually needing the capital to fit cell phones with good crypto.

Yes, you could go to jail if you turn on a radio to listen to certain
radio waves coming into your bedroom. The Pro2006 scanner from Radio
Shack is easily modified to receive cellular, but will be forbidden to
import or manufacture as of (I think) this April.

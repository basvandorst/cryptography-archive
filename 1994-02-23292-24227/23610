Well, Message Authentication Codes (MACs) are not quite the same thing as
digital sigs, but are used in banking to authorize funds transfers.
Both between banks and between banks and their customers.
This is standardized in ANSI X9.9, which is DES-based.

BTW, I read that the NSA has convinced the ABA to support submission of the
evil Skipjack scheme to ANSI for addition to X9.9.

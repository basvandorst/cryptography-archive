Uh-huh.  Of course this isn't the market that buys secure telephony to
begin with.
The foreign buyer that knows enough to care also knows that between liberal
and pernicious extraterritorial application of American law, and lack of
any
standing before American courts, it is *precisely* the ability of the USG
to 
monitor them that is very worrying about the Clipper standard.  Why would I
buy Clipper if a Government which does not answer to me and to which I do
not answer, and whose interests are potentially inimicable to my own and
those
of my country, can freely break any transmission I make?

(Speaking only as a Canadian friend, neighbor and business competitor, of
course).

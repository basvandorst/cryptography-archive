   Supposing we measure effort expended per bit of output?

That's relatively easy.  The recent proof of the composite nature of
F_22 ( i.e. 2^2^22 + 1) took about 10^16 machine instructions and
generated one bit of output.  The RSA-129 calculation will take about
15 times as many instructions, but is factoring a 425-bit number.

Anyone who knows of a ratio greater than 10^16 per bit should post
details.

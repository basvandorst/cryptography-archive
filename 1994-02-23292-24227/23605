   I think the best way to do this would be to have each user register his
public key with the remailer when he joins up. The remailer also has 
a public key.

   When a sends to b, a encrypts the message with the remailer's public key.
The remailer decrypts it, determines who the recipient is, and then 
encrypts it with the recipients public key. Random length strings of garbage
can be prepended to the message each way, and they can be batched up until 
a certain number of them are ready to be transmitted -- in random order, of 
course. 

   The message should never be stored in plaintext on the disk on the remailer, 
and the lookup tables to find the recipients should not exist in plaintext
on any magnetic media either. Each time the system is brought up, the admin
would have to type in the passphrase to start things working. Even if the system
were seized, unless they kept it powered up, they'd have no hope of breaking into 
it.

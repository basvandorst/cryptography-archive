I'm wondering how much cryptanalysis/cryptography is like a chess game.  Let
me explain.  Let's suppose that you employ a crypto scheme that uses single
DES with a random session key.  How much "checking" and outguessing your
potential opponent should go into "validating" that key?  Is it wise to
assume a RATIONAL opponent?

We know that certain DES keys are inherently "weak".  Beyond that, though,
some might be provisionally weak, based on the opponent's plan of attack.
Let's say that out opponent is IRrational enough to attempt an exhaustive
key search on a 486 PC, just as an example.  He writes a C program that
merely increments a key variable from 0 to 2^56-1 searching for matches.
Clearly, the odds are staggering that his attempt will fail.  But let's just
say that our randomly chosen session key happens to be a very LOW number,
with a lot of leading zero bits.  He might just get "lucky" and find it
before he gives up the effort, if our key is low enough.  Or conversely, he
might decrement his counter in a loop instead, making a HIGH key vulnerable.

OTOH, to throw out an arbitrary number of "high" and "low" keys to thwart
such a "lucky" attack effectively reduces your total keyspace.  And to
further complicate it, any widespread, "standardized" attempt to thwart such
an attack by filtering out keys at either extreme might merely cause him to
alter the starting point of his search.

What's the wisest course in using "random" session keys?  How "random" can
we safely allow them to be?  They say that the wisest way to design a crypto
system is to think like a code BREAKER, but do you necessarily have to think
like a RATIONAL one, as opposed to one who will attempt a brute force
attack, even though, mathematically, it will most likely take BILLIONS or
even TRILLIONS of years?

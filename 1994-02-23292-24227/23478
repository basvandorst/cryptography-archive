Summary: What does the government haved planned?
Keywords: Clipper chip

There has been a lot of talk in the mass media and even more rumaors on the net
concerning the governments clipper chip.  WHat I have heard is this, that the 
government has standardized a crytography system that is implemented on a chip,
clipper.  I have also heard that the givernment will not release the actual
workings of the method to the public.  What I want to knoww is:
             1) What does the government wish to do with this chip.
             2) Is it meant to be used as the only crytography method
                used in the US.
             3) Will goverment agencies have access to the chips weaknesses.
                to be used in cryptonalysis.

Sorry if these questions are foolish or have been discussed in detail before.

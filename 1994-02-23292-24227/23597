Earlier traffic on this newsgroup.

The White House has said it doesn't, and I am not prepared to call them
liars. If you are, without specific evidence, that's a position for which
you must bear any personal onus.

Come on, Steve, you know better than that. "Security by obscurity" refers to
concealing an algorithm, not compartmentization.

You're starting to sound like some of the nut cases here. I expect better of
you than that. You know perfectly well compartmentation is a standard
security technique not only in the government but elsewhere.

This is flawed logic. They're not compromising their privacy if, as they
must believe, the escrow system works reliably.

Not in this country. The government is charged under a number of laws
including the Full Employment Act of 1947 to look after the economic
interests of this country's private sector. What do you think the Federal
Reserve is all about as a Macroeconomic Policy organization? What do you
think many Federal economic stimulus and labor adjustment programs are all
about. It is within the purview of government to offer systems for the
protection of the private sector--in this case voluntary.

Dunno--this does not sound like the Steve Brinich I know, who usually is
much more logical and well informed. Maybe the messsage I'm replying to is a
crude forgery.

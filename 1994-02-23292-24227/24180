To join the whispering in the back pew of the church.....

We're a little confused, I think. Fibre glass is glass (actually not a solid 
but a supercooled fluid) drawn into fine strands. These strands have remarkable
flexibility and a tensile strength greater than steel.

These fibres are used for purposes as diverse as telecommunications and 
thermal insulation.

Finally, embedded in a polymer plastic, the whole produced a constructional 
material known as GRP (glass reinforced plastic).

        What is interesting is that many boards and networks use this
        argument as justification for banning encrypted mail on their
        systems - "I'm responsible therefore I want to be able to
        read everything on here".  It occurs to me that if I were
        running a board and it was clear that I was responsible for
        the contents of the board, I would _insist_ that all traffic
        was either securely encrypted or clearsigned.

        Anyway, on a related topic, does anyone know the status of the
        'secure bulletin board' project (PBBS I believe it was
        called)?

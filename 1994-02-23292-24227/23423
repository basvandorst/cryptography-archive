   It would be wise to remember that they (people at NSA) likely believe 
that what they're doing is in the best interests of the US, and its 
citizens. We don't really know how much good they do by listening in,
because they keep it all so secret -- again, for reasons they believe to 
be very important -- they don't want the "bad guys" to know the extent of their 
abilities.

   If you make the assumption that they honestly believe that they're the
"good guys", and that they're protecting the free world, it explains alot. 
They're willing, to a certain extent, to let the ends justify the means. 
Unfortunately the means in this case also give them and other agencies
the capability to become a very opressive regime. And as any military
person will tell you, when sizing up a potential adversary, you stay
strictly away from intentions, because those can change instantly, but 
instead you base your threat estimates on capabilities -- because capabilities 
change more slowly, and more visibly.

One obvious comment.  Attacks such as these require a plaintext with the
corresponding encrypted ciphertext.  While it is fairly easy to get your
hands on a few plaintext-ciphertext pairs, there is no way you will ever
get 2^43 pairs without already knowing the keys.  It would take a person
centuries just to generate that many pairs.

I would also point out that 2^43 pairs of 64 bit plain + 64 bit ciphertext
text would occupy 128 terabytes of disk space.  I'm wondering how long it would
take the above mentioned workstations to read in that much data, much less
process it.

For the average user who does not use cryptography for communications but
only for data protection his only concern should be ciphertext only attacks.
There is still no known ciphertext only attack against DES which is better
than brute-force.

As major a step as getting to the moon allows you to get to the next solar
system.

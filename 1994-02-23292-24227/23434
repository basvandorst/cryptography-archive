    [note that the negation here negates only the main clause of the
    quoted passage, not the secondary clause.  In effect this says that
    the Admin. is not going to ban all cryptography {of course not; they
    are producing it themselves], but that it DOES consider crypto to
    threaten "public safety and ...law enforcement."]

Assuming that the quotation marks are correct, to be perfectly fair,
this isn't true either -- it isn't saying anything of the sentence in
quotes, hence it isn't saying that encryption threatens public safety.

Is the placement of the quotation marks correct?

The longer answer is, if you're not convinced, get the source code
and compile it yourself.  Then you can see for yourself, if you know
how to read source code.

Another answer is, get a version that is accompanied by a PGP
signature of a reliable organization.  For example, ftp.funet.fi
distributes a signature file along with the software.  That means
they stand behind it.

In the end, consider this.  Do you really think Zimmermann would
write in a trap door, no matter who may have threatened him,  when
everyone gets to see the source code?

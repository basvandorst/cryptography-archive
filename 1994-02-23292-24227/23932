There are two variants of triple DES:

Two-key, which is y = E(k1, D(k2, E(k1, x))), and
three-key, which is y = E(k3, D(k2, E(k1, x))).

The decryption in the middle is there for backwards
compatability with single DES; if you set k1=k2 in the
two-key variant, or k1=k2=k3 in the three-key variant
the encryption is equivalent to y = E(k1, x). Decrypting
instead of encrypting has no adverse impact on security
when the keys are different.

The backwards compatibility property of these schemes makes
sense only in hardware, of course.

No, the scheme you suggest here is actually three-key triple
DES with the middle block being an encryption instead of a
decryption, and three-key is definitely stronger than two-key.
The reason that some people prefer two-key over three-key
could have something to do with key size.

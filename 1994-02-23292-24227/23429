I know it's unfashionable to do anything but draw parallels between
the NSA and the Nazi Party in these newsgroups, but does pointless
raving have to follow every mention?

In the quoted text, the NSA guys said, several times, that they
don't want to regulate encryption, and that they think the idea
would be naive and unimplementable.  They don't say "...which
is too damn bad, because we wanna NAIL that Jim Bowery character,"
and there is no indication they looked glum or disappointed.

So lay off, man.  It's good news that the NSA guys would say
such a thing.

Yeah, yeah.  Look -- we've already heard it.  We don't need content-
free noise on the net.  Your privacy is already secure if you want
it to be, and the NSA says flat out that they don't want to force
you to use Clipper.  So you don't have to use Clipper.  So your
personal servants (the NSA, of course) don't get to read all your
really important posts to sci.crypt while you compose them.

Hey, any idea if any of this will sink in to the million rabid
posters who see conspiracy behind every tree?

>Fat chance.

Yeah, thought so. :)

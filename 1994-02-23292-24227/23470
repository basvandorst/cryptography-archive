We already had this discussion at the national policy level. Secretary of
State Stimson said "Gentlemen do not read each other's mail" and closed the
"American Black Chamber". That didn't last--his policy lost and the
capabilities that led to the NSA were created. In a sense, the NSA is a
national policy expression that in some cases the ends DO justify the means.
So are some other functions of government. The trick is to decide which
limits to place on the means. Thus Congress' decision forbidding
asassination as a tool of covert action.

Note that I'm describing what is, not what I think. I, too, was raised both
by my parents and my teachers to believe that the ends don't justify the
means, and I try to run my life that way, though like the rest of us, I'm a
fallible human being.

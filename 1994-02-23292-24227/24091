It's probably not one-to-one, and it's quite likely that many passwords map
to the same encryption string.  I've never seen it happen, though, and it's
low enough probability that it wont give you any mileage.

and so on.  Yes, in principle this approach works fine, and you can run it
through all 16*25 iterations of the basic modified DES function and solve
the resulting 64 equations for the 56 key bits somehow... they're not linear
though, so you'll have to be intensely clever or lucky.

This is the show-stopper.  It blows up beyond all recognition by about
iteration 4 or so of the 400 iterations.

I was hoping for this (in the 16-round DES case) 15 years ago, figuring
that if there was a trap door the boolean expressions would collapse
dramatically.  They didn't... at least not with the homebrew tools I was
using.

Yes (assuming the final munging into 2+11 printable characters is
reversible), but totally impractical because of the intermediate expressions.

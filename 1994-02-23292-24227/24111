The session key cannot be stored in the executable or else one could
simply disassemble it out.  So, it seems that the best route would be to
use the answer to the question as the session key, or an MD5 of the
answer.  Of course trying to think up a good question would be difficult.
 If you could arrange with the person beforehand, and use a line from a
poem or song, you might get pretty good results.

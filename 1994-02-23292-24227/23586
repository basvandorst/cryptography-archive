IMHO, Traffic analysis is a big part of this. CPU wise it is far
cheaper to do traffic analysis on every clipper chip, than to decode
every transmission. Traffic analysis can then be used as the basis for
getting court order for keys.. he is sending encrypted data to X.

The FBI/et. al. claims this technology gives them nothing new, but that
is not true. It gives then clipper encryption "STRONG" traffic analysis.

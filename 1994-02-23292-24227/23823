It also depends on whether you are worried about the Mafia corrupting
people associated with key escrow or NSA. If you are worried enough
about this kind of corruption, you shouldn't use Clipper.

IMO, if Clipper is heavily used for a long time, the key escrow facilities
will become immensely valuable items like nuclear weapons depots or
large gold stockpiles. Worse, the valuable items could be copied rather
than stolen, so a security breach might go undetected. I don't think
the U.S. government should create this risk.  It might be OK for people
to use Clipper if they have special reasons to help the government read their
mail. Other people should not use it, nor should the government encourage
them to. In particular, bank and credit card transactions are not
appropriate for Clipper. Usually these transactions are among ordinary
people and businesses. They (and the U.S. government as well, since
its tax income depends on the ordinary peoples' wealth) are safer
if they emphasize security, not proving to the government that they have
nothing to hide. Anyway, people with nothing to hide are rare and may have
unusual ideas of right and wrong, and thus perhaps are untrustworthy.

I have following computing problem:

There are four integers a1,a2,b1,b2 with large values.
I have to determine the relation between their products.
Namely whether 

     a1.a2 > b1.b2   

without actually carrying out the multiplication of a1,a2 and b1,b2.
The multiplication gives integer overflow because of large
values of variables.
Is there any way of doing this?
(The problem arises in the case: a1 > b1 and a2 < b2 or vice-versa)

Thanks.

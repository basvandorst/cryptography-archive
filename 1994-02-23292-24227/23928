Wanted: Beta tester = code breaker.

As you know, the security of polyalphabetic encrypting is generally 
considered inferior to methods like DES, RSA and knapsacks.

After considering why the polyalphabetic approach have failed, 
I am not so sure this is true. 
It seems to me that the existing polyalphabetic encryptors simply 
may not have been designed in the proper way.
Naturally, I may be wrong.

As a consequence, I am looking for an experienced code breaker to test 
if my new encrypting program (running under DOS 3.x +) is just another 
run-of-the-mill flop or a brilliant new concept in polyalphabetic 
encrypting design.

If you want to participate, send either
   an email to john.staahle@dkb.dk 
or a snail mail to 
   John Staahle 
   289A Buddinge Hovedgade
   DK-2880 Bagsverd
   Denmark, Europe
stating:

1. Your real name
2. Your private address
3. Your email address
4. Your phone number.
5. Preferred floppy size (1.2 or 1.44 MB)

In return I shall provide you with:

1. The same information as I get.
2. a 400 KB encrypted binary file which translates to 7 bit ASCII 
   US-English text.
   I have run this file through bigram, trigram, Kasisky and Friedman 
   tests w/o any definite result.
3. a small file with the first 3 lines of the 400 KB file in clear text.
4. a file with letter frequency, bigrams, trigrams and 
   MeasureOfRoughness for clear text of 400 KB file.
5. whatever else you may want to break the code - within reasonable 
   limits - you may send me a text file to encrypt (after re-arranging
   the text somewhat).
........
The only reward I can offer in return is the triumphant feeling of your
being better at code breaking than I am at designing encrypting 
programs.

Best regards, John

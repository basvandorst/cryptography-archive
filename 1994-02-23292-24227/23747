	Whether the original TEMPEST specs were produced in the US, I'm not 
sure. Quite possibly they were. However, for many years now, the military 
TEMPEST specs have been a common standard to the NATO nations (and, quite 
possibly, to other selected but non-treaty countries). This govt/mil spec is 
classified and therefore it would be an offence to reveal to unauthorised 
parties what it is (assuming one knew in the first place).

	Very much later than the NATO govt/mil spec, other versions of 
TEMPEST spec were authorised by NATO governments for application in the 
development and production of electronic equipment for non-governmental 
(i.e. commercial) use. With two specifications, it may or may not be correct
to assume that there are two standards. Though equipment built to the 
non-govermental TEMPEST spec is not classified, such equipment is subject to 
some controls (export). The 'commercial' specification itself remains 
classified also. 

	This subject comes up sufficiently often to wonder if it is not worth
revising and expanding the appropriate section of the FAQ.

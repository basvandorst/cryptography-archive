Another, already somewhat widely used alternative is 
RSA Data Security's "DESX", as implemented in their commercial
products MailSafe and BSAFE since 1986/87.  DESX is ordinary
DES with pre- and post-processing to expand keysize and
security.  Like Ladder DES, it is faster than triple-DES.

I have some reason to believe that RSA may be willing to
allow use of DESX free of licensing fees.  Perhaps someone
from RSA would comment?

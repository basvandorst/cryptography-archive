But the Clipper proposal is something completely different (and much
more dangerous): it's giving that espionage infrastructure which was
(stupidly) trashed by Stimson and later rebuilt effective control of
the use of cryptography in the entire communications system.

I don't care if the government uses clipperphones to talk to itself.
In fact, I hope it does.

I don't want to see it giving preferential treatment to Clipper vs.
civilian, non-escrowed algorithms of approximately equal or lesser
strength.

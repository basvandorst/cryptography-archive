Of course, this would be vulnerable to exhaustive search of the salary space.
Just hash all plausable salaries and compare each with the other person's
hash.

A better protocol would be interactive.  We alternate telling each other bits
of our hash values until one of us discovers a mismatch or until
we run out of bits and agree that our salaries are the same.  (Extending
the protocol to thwart an evesdropper from observing the hash value in the
event of a match is left as an exercise to the reader.)

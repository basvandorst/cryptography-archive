If you have a mac and want to play with 2WayTalker,
a full duplex voice communication system for use
over appletalk networks, you can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu
or its mirrors (often busy) or can ftp from my directory
at netcom.com [192.100.81.100]

/pub/grady/2WayTalker2.1.sit.hqx

It is a fully-functional demo of using off-the-shelf
Macintoshes to implement a digitized telephone or monitoring
system.

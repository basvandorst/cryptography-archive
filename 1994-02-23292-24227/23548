	I was under the impression that the whole basis for this type of
surveillance was as follows:  Each of the signals emitted come from slightly
different circuits.  The board traces, the rise times, the load on a signal,
ad nauseum all contribute to the way _one_ signal looks.  And they're all
pretty unique.  They can be picked out.
 I doubt this is ever very easy, and I think that if someone is
sophisticated enough to do it at all, they can probably manage to pick
out what they want, noise or not.  But don't you think that someone who
will go to this kind of trouble is _really_ interested?  Like a gov't
or related agency?  For Naonal Security Reasons?
	I would rather trust a TEMPESTed computer than a room full of
a computer's buddies.  Of course, the plans for that 5 Megaton, uh,
device - they're not done on my computer, anyway.  <-- yes, it's a JOKE.

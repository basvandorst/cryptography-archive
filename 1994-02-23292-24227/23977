Dear Reader,
I wonder if you would mind helping me with information regarding any
person who will have a trip to Saint-Petersburg, Russia. The point is
that I need some  help with shipping a small computer from America and
I do not want to use normal mail because this way is not very reliable.
This computer will very useful for my scientific work as PhD here in Russia.
Thanks!

With best regards
Anton Fokin,
Saint-Petersburg
RUSSIA

No.  However, if you use Clipper, then you have an encryption chip and
no manufacturer will install 2 different encryption chips (Clipper and DES).

Yes, in an abstract sense.  If you use Clipper, then you are silently
approving the administration's plan and aiding folks like Mykotronix.
By being a citizen whose key is on file with the gov't, you make it
difficult for those of us who argue that the government has no right
to any citizen's crypto keys.  *That*, in turn, makes you and all of
us less secure by hastening the day when the gov't pushes through a law
prohibiting private ownership or usage of crypto.

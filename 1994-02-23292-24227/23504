Some things occured to me.

1)
The government will definitely misuse the keys. 
That is what Watergate was all about: the government routinely
sneaking around.  It seems the Democrats were doing it as much as
the Republicans, so that aside is just a diversion.

2) 
Private encription will be banned.
Clipper fails without the ban. Simply use your personal enscription, then send
the cyphertext through clipper. Clipper fails.

3) 
This whole issue the copy-protection battle played out again.
New copy-protection, new copy-protection breakers.
The result, most programs that insist on copy-protection went out
of use.

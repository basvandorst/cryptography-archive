Courtesy of Peter Simons, I have made available German and Swedish
language texts for PGP2.3a.

The files are
	black.ox.ac.uk:/src/security/pgp_german.txt
	black.ox.ac.uk:/src/security/pgp_swedish.txt

Both take the form of PGP armoured and signed messages.  They are
*not* encrypted so anyone with PGP can read them.

A Lithuanian kit is also available.  It is pgp23ltk.zip -- sorry for
the different naming standard and compression method, but that was the
author's choice.

Anyone with other language kits is encouraged to contact me, and I
will add them to the collection.

Paul

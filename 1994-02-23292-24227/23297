First of all I should like to appologize for having carried on and
added to the confusion about the names of the author and the subject
of the book. The author is William Stevenson and "Intrepid" is
Sir William Stephenson.

Now here are a few references to book reviews and articles about
William Stephenson and his biography authors.

1)	Hugh Trevor-Roper (Lord Dacre), New York Review of Books,
	13 May 1976, pp. 3-4. He calles the book 'A Man Called
	Intrepid" for 'utterly worthless'.

2)	Sir David Hunt, Times Literary Supplement, 28 May 1976, p. 643
	Similar verdict.

3)	David Stafford, '"Intrepid": Myth and Reality',
	Journal of Contemporary History, Vol. 22 (1987), pp. 303-317.

4)	David Stafford, 'A Myth Called Intrepid', 
	Saturday Night magazine, Oct. 1989.

5)	Timothy J. Naftali, 'Intrepid's Last Deception: Documenting
	the Career of Sir William Stephenson', Intelligence and
	National Security, Vol. 8, No. 3, July 1993, pp. 72-99.

The last paper is quite revealing. Interesting reading.

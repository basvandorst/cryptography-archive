It seems to me that the only crypto system that will be good enough
for the people would be one that is good enough for classified gov't
information. Perhaps it should be suggested the gov't use the same
crypto as the people including the escrowing of their keys just like
Joe Citizen.  I suspect the mechanism to get access to the escrowed
keys would become a bit more stringent.

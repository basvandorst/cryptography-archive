So now we hear the NSA wants to get the Europeans (and eventually
everyone else) to use Clipper.  Hmm...

Does this mean the US gets everyone else's keys to keep in escrow?  If
not, I'll buy a Portugese Clipper phone.  If so, will the US government
give copies of Honda's keys to GM?  Does this mean the French get
copies of the US keys?  If so, I wouldn't want to use it to conduct
business given the record of French intelligene spying on US industry
and giving the results to French industry.

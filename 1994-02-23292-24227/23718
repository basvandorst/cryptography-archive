Yes, David Sternlight was on the pre-registration list for the RSA Data
Security Conference.  Never did see him though.

Clint Brooks, Deputy Director of NSA was on the program.  He was not
there either.  I understand that he was in California.  (In noting
Clint's absence, Jim Bidzos said that Clint told him that hsi job would
be on the line if he showed up.  Jim asked him if he was inviting an
offer.)

It is probably just as well.  They would not have liked my keynote talk;
none of those wearing "DoD" badges seemed to like it.  Perhaps it was
because I had laryngitis.  Perhaps it was because I only had laryngitis.

After the announcement of the DSS, one of them told me "The sovereign
does what the sovereign must do."  While this was said in good humor,
their sense of humor becomes a little brittle when the people do what
the people must do.

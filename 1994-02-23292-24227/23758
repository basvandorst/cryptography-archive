Here's another human-factors issue:
Maybe NSA can break IDEA, and maybe not. In any case, they won't
expose their IDEA-breaking capability casually (say, to get some
civil-forfeiture goodies off a porn seller) -- these guys were
careful about such things since Purple!
 
If they can break Clipper, they can always break it first, get
the key out of escr*w later, and nobody would be any the wiser.
 
It therefore seems that IDEA is _effectively_ stronger than Cliper
-- in one case, the guys that can break it were born with masking-tape
over their mouths.

	I'm wondering if anybody could help me with a curious (not that  
important) codebreaking problem.  Recently the band Rush came out with a new  
album, Counterparts.  Included on part of the cd foldout was three lines of  
binary code.  There have been many arguments as to what this code means, with  
some people claiming to have decoded it, and some saying it doesn't mean  
anything.  The problem is, the people who say they have cracked it never seem  
to want to say *how* they decoded it, so a lot of us don't believe them.
	I was wondering if the following three lines can be converted to  
text, and if so, what would that text be (however muddled and nonsensical).

The three lines, carefully typed and checked TWICE:

1010100101010110100110101101010010101100101101010010101011011
0101001010101101001101011010100101011001011010100101010110100
1010100101010110100110101101010010101100101101010010101011011

	There are some interesting things I notice (even with no background  
in cryptography): aren't the 1st and 2nd lines the opposite of each other,  
with the third line being a copy of the 1st?  I don't know if that is  
significant.
	So, I'd appreciate it if any of you cryptwizards out there could tell  
me the potential text equivalents, or whether this is all a bad joke.

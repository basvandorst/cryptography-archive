I can see a 3rd:

Whether or not the NSA can break IDEA, they won't expose their decrypt
skills casually (say, to get some civil-forfeiture goodies off a porn
dealer).

But if I use Clipper, and the NSA breaks it, they can get a court order
_after_ they find stuff they care about, and I won't be any the wiser.

It thus seems Clipper is _effectively_ weaker than (say) IDEA.

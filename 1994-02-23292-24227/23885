If I understand the question, I think there is a missapprehension of 'random'.

It's more like the Borges story of the tower of Babel where every book that
can be written, is.  Somewhere there is the true story of your life.
Somewhere else there is the true story of your life with one misspelling and
so on.

In other words a random sequence of letters can take on a multitude of forms,
including *all* of those which apparently have meaning. So there is a lot
of ways to convert a OTP to a sequence with less entropy.

Well....It depends.

Essentially, it depends on how fast and over how large a slice of the spectrum
the hopper moves. Many hoppers are constrained to skitter about on as few as 
four or six frequencies, all located within a meg or so of bandwidth, and 
with dwell times that are a substantial fraction of a second. That makes them 
meat in the market for an intelligent countermeasure operator with a spectrum 
analyser.

If would be a very fair bet that there are other ways also of searching for 
and identifying the presence of more difficult hoppers.

Not all hopper types are equally jam resistant, particularly if operating in an 
already congested spectrum...and BTW hoppers can be DF'ed with much greater 
accuracy than the equivalent VHF/UHF transmitter.

All that glisters is not gold....there are no free lunches... etc...etc.

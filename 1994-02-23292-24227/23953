I suggest also _Cryptanalysis_ by Helen Fouche Gaines, Dover, 1956.
It is probably still in print. The treatment is not intended as
mathematical but this seems only to mean that the notation and
terminology are a bit non-standard. The exclusive emphasis
on pencil-and paper methods is actually good for programmers because
it forces the author to give very detailed examples.

We've been working during the last two years on a software
architecture that incorporates cryptographic message processing
algorithms with network protocols, in a composable, modular fashion.
During the next three years we will be expanding this work in several
directions, and we have a fulltime programmer/analyst position
available.  If you enjoy programming and have a good grasp of
cryptographic algorithms and network security issues, please consider
southern Arizona, an area with, at this very moment, shirtsleeve
weather and no seismic activity.

Tucson is located in the Sonoran desert, and is a city of 600K people
and seven mountain ranges.  In addition to the beauty of the
environment, there are a multitude of excellent espresso bars.

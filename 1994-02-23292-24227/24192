Except that, as noted previously, one need only coopt one judge to get a
"perfectly legal" wiretap order.

Well, many people might think it better if all the phones were untappable.

What would prevent the envelopes from being re-sealed?  This would be
especially easy if one had help from the agency that did the sealing.

Unfortunately under the current Clipper design, the manufacturer is a
single point of failure (since the chips are programmed with the entire
key in one step).

Well, it's still not clear that Clipper would have more effect on crooks
than on honest people; your approach is certainly an improvement over the
original proposal in this regard.  Given the stonewalling on even the
major security problems with Clipper, though, I question whether the
government _wants_ any privacy improvements...

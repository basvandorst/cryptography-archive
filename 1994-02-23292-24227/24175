[A long procedere for B to validate his credits and send 50 of them to A]

The server is heavily involved in every step of the process you described.
At all times, the server has to keep track on who is in possession of
each "coin".  I have invented:-) a scheme wich offers all the same benefits,
uses less computing power and communications bandwidth, and allows 
arbitrary denominations:

1. B opens an account in a bank.  Somehow, an opening balance of 100 credits
is created.

2. B sends a (time-stamped, numbered, private-key-encrypted, checksummed)
message to the bank instructing it to transfer 50 credits to A's account.


What good is digital cash, unless it is anonymous?
What could prevent anonymous digital cash from being copied?
Who wants anonymous cash anyway (not the banks, not the cops)?

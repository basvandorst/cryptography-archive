Quoting from the FCC's part 97.311 (rules for amateur radio):

(c) Only the following types of SS emission transmissions are
authorized (hybrid SS emissions transmissions involving both
spreading techniques are prohibited):
(1) Frequency hopping where the carrier of the transmitted signal
is modulated with unciphered information and changes frequency
intervals under the direction of a high speed code sequence.
(2) Direct sequence where the information is modulo-2 added to a
high speed code sequence. The combined information and code are
then used to modulate the RF carrier. The high speed code sequence
dominates the modulation function, and is the direct cause of the
wide spreading of the transmitted signal.

It sounds like the FCC considers frequency hopping to be SS.

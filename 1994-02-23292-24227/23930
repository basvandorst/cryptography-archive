Well, since nobody else has answered.  

Yes there is a method for solving mixed alphabet Vigeneres.  There are
specialized methods depending on how both key and plaintext alphabets
are "mixed".  Sinkov in _Elementary Cryptanalysis_ describes at least
one specialized method (maybe two, don't recall).  The ACA provides
a brief description for all methods, in their publication _Novice
Notes_.  (ACA = American Cryptogram Association).

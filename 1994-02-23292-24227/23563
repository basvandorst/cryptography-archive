Comments on viability of this crypto-algorithm?

I have seven wheels (circular buffers) with 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, & 23
positions on each, respectively.  Each position holds a random number.
At the start of a message, I align all wheels to the top-dead-center
position.  I take the first character of the plaintext, xor with each 
wheel's top number in succession, deriving my ciphertext.  I advance 
each wheel one position, and repeat with the next character.  I can 
optionally have an eighth wheel, containing a password.

I think it gives me, in essence, a 4,800,000 character pseudorandom xor
sequence with random access capability into a file, a relatively quick
implementation, and bidirectionality ( for what that's worth... )

I'll probably have no more than a few kbytes at a time encrypted in one
place with this, but an attacker would have a pretty good idea as to
the structure of the plaintext.  I just want him/her to be unable to 
modify it without detection. ( The last few bytes of the plaintext 
would be a checksum or CRC... )

I don't need security from Governmental Onslaught, but simply from PC
hackers, and maybe a crypto-knowledgeable layperson. ( I.E., no one's 
gonna _pay_ anyone to break this... )

By the way, please reply to pbosch@motown.ge.com , rather than
the address above.  Our XVNews mailer is Drain-Bamaged and gives
me the wrong reply-to, but won't let me post, if I change it.
Thanks...

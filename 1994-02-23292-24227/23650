	Let me rephrase my question. What I wanted to know, mostly, was:

	Given a strong public key crypto method, such as RSA, and given
a set of messages in encypted form, and a set of messages in plaintext,
is it any easier to figure out which plaintext corresponds to which
encypted stream? Are there shortcuts which would be much easier than
"cracking" the encryption?

   What kind of evidence is there to support the conjecture that

   as the general factorization problem?

So far as I am aware there is no direct evidence that factoring primes
is hard, except that no-one can find an easy way of doing it, which I
think answers HALF of your question.

There is an implicit part to your question which is "Is it easier to
factor a number which is he product of only two primes than to do
general factoring." Well, again as far as I'm aware, no one has
admitted to looking at the problem from the "only two primes"
viewpoint. It is almost certainly going to be slightly easier,
although there is no general theory.

In any case the real issue is can the improvement in the complexity
functions of modular exponentiation algorithms keep pace with the
prime factoring algorithms because in most practical applications the
key length can be increased.

For the moment the answer is, I think, that the evidence is empirical,
but I'm not even sure HOW you would go about showing anything else.

The system in question was TENEX, not Multics.  The attack only worked,
because the password was checked one character at a time against a 
plaintext password.  The string compare routine stopped at the first
mis-match, so taking a page fault meant that all characters up to that
point were valid.  No cryptography was involved at all.

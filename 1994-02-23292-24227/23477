CALL FOR PAPERS : CARDIS

FIRST SMART CARD RESEARCH AND ADVANCED APPLICATION CONFERENCE

October 24 - 26 , 1994 LILLE FRANCE 

Sponsored by IFIP - The international Federation for Information processing

AIMS AND GOALS

Smart cards or IC cards are becoming a significant part of the information 
processing world. Furthermore they are beginning to move towards real 
integration into the information systems. They participate in the overall 
data management, security and communication processes. But they bring their 
own special characteristics. It is very likely that future IC cards will 
require many scientific and technical improvements which represent a challenge 
for the success of the technology.So far there are many events which are
mostly 
devoted to the commercial and application aspects of IC cards. There is now an 
opportunity to initiate a scientific conference bringing specialists who are 
involved in all aspects of design of the future IC cards and related devices 
and environment.IFIP - the International Federation for Information Processing 
has agreed to sponsor this conference. It will be the first occasion for the 
IC card community to start a permanent activity : In addition to the
conference 
itself there will be discussions about creating a permenent group within IFIP 
with possible implication for advancing standards, publishing and
international 
cooperation.

SUBMISSIONS
Six copies of detailed abstracts of original papers corresponding to one or 
several themes for the conference should be sent in English to the program 
chairman before May 2, 1994. The submissions will start with a succint
statement 
of the problem addressed and their significance, appropriate for a
non-specialist.
Technical development directed to the specialist should follow as needed (at
most 
ten pages). 
They should be accompanied by a fact sheet indicating the following:
  - Title of the paper with the relevant conference theme(s)
  - Author(s) with affiliation, address, phone and fax numbers E-mail
  - Proceedings will be available at the conference

   I've been wondering...about how many calculations\
   does it take to break a 1024 bit RSA key?  And,
   how hard is it to break the password protection
   for the keyrings?  I'm sure this has been answered
   before, but I was hoping for a fairly straightforward
   answer.  Many thanks for your help.


This ought to be in the FAQ, as it comes up so often.  I posted an
analysis a few months back, but can't find it again now.  Did anyone
save it?  If so, please re-post.  The conclusion I came to was that
brute-forcing IDEA was about as hard as factoring 3200-bit RSA moduli.


The best of the current algorithms, the General Number Field Sieve,
takes about 1 GIPS-year to factor 425-bit numbers.  1 GIPS-year is
3e16 machine instructions (3e7 seconds per annum, 1 GIPS is 1e9
instructions per second).  The time taken for GNFS grows as

	exp {(1.923 + o(1))(log N) ^ (1/3) (log log N) ^ (2/3)}

to factor a number N.  Let us assume the o(1) is exactly 1.

Then t(1024)/t(425) =

	exp {1.923(log 2^425) ^ (1/3) (log log 2^425) ^ (2/3)}
	--------------------------------------------------------
	exp {1.923(log 2^1024) ^ (1/3) (log log 2^1024) ^ (2/3)}


According to bc(1), assuming I calculated it correctly, this ratio is
3e8.

Acquiring 1 GIPS year is non-trivial.  Acquiring 300 GIPS years (three
thousand 100MIPS processors doing nothing else for a year) is feasible
but rather expensive.  I would very much like to lay my hands on a
system a million times more powerful yet.


Conclusion: factoring general 1024-bit numbers with the best of today's
technology is infeasible by a factor of a million or so.

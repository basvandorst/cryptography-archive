This part I find almost unbelievable.  Surely there isn't anyone who
thinks that a system run like this will not be abused.  All any cop has
to do is wait until he's filing a legitimate wiretap order, and ask for
whatever keys he want.  I mean, what the hell, may as well throw the
ex-wife's serial number on that list too.  The escrow agency won't know
the difference.  While he's at it, why not grab the key for one of
Citibank's EFT lines.  I'm sure someone would be willing to pay for that.

Does anyone think that these keys are not going to get sold?  A lot of
them are going to be worth literally millions of dollars (EFT lines for
example).  How hard do you think it is to find a cop who will take
$50,000 just for putting an extra number onto a form?

This is just great.  At one of the CFP conferences, a representative of
the FBI stated that criminals weren't using crypto now, but that they
wanted to stay ahead of the curve.  So we get Clipper.  Now, they admit
that they don't expect criminals to use the key-escrow system either.  So
the end effect on criminals will be nil.  It won't change the 'curve' at
all.  They will begin using strong crypto whenever they get their act
together.  Probably sooner, now that crypto has been brought to their
attention by the FBI and NSA.  If they were serious about staying ahead
of criminals, they would be putting money into how to investigate crime
once wiretaps don't work.  They say they don't want to help criminals,
but given the apperant structure of the key-escrow system, I'd say
white-collar crime will have a heyday with this system.  Get everyone
trusting their 'secure' crypto, all the while the keys will be available
to anyone with the connections or the money.  This whole thing stinks so
bad it's unbelievable.

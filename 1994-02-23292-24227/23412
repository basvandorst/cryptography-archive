***************************************************************************
Alice and Bob want to compare salaries without revealing any information 
other than equal/not equal. (1) They both interpret their salary as
a phone number. (2) Alice calls the number that corresponds to her salary
and asks for Bob. (3) Bob calls the number that corresponds to his salary
and asks if somebody just called for him.

I would like to compile some crypto material like this, that can be read and 
understood by kids in upper secondary school and highschool. What I want is 
interesting and thoughtprovoking examples of cryptographical protocols to open
the eyes of the kids and get them interested in learning more. 

Please post any similar idea of an illustration of some cryptographic idea
if you have any. 

Thanks, 
Markus

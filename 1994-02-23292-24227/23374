Don't know about TTS, but any encoding scheme can represent more
characters than its bits allow.  This goes back to the old TTY
Murray(?) 5-bit teletype code, the grand-daddy of ASCII.  You use
shift characters.  For ASCII, with SI and SO, you get 2*126
possible characters.  If you were to designate additional SI2 and
SO2 characters, you can get a bunch more.

If you run out of shifty characters, use alt. :-)  Sorry, couldn't
resist.

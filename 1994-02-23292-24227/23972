Cellular phones, and some other related forms of transmission, are covered
by a recent US law that makes monitoring illegal.

Most other forms of transmission are covered by much older laws, which
specify that you can listen all you want, but information gained from
transmissions not specifically meant as broadcasts can't be passed on to
others or exploited for profit.  This is the situation in North America;
rules vary elsewhere.

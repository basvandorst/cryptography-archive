I'm about to release for testing an encrypted file system for a
certain free Unix, and would like to know if the implementation method
that I have chosen could be improved before I release it.

I get the passphrase from the user (up to 1023 characters) and hash it
with MD5. The resulting hash is used as the 128 bit IDEA key. I hash
the passphrase again with MD4 and keep only 64 bits to use as an IV.
Are there any problems here ? Would it help to iterate MD5 about
10,000 times to slow down a brute force passphrase search ?

Each block in the fs (1024 bytes) is encrypted as an independent unit,
using the key and IV generated above using IDEA in CBC mode. This
means that identical blocks will encipher to identical ciphertext - is
this a problem ?


Thanks in advance,

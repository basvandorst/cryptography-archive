I guess I wasn't as clear as I could have been.  By "non-wiretap
intercepts", I was refering to encrypted data that comes in to
the hands of law enforcement by some mechanism other than a wiretap.
For example, encrypted data files (Encrypted, e.g., with Tessera),
that are (lawfully) turned over to the police by an informant.  I was
also refering to data where there is no law enforcement or national 
security interest per se, but some other compelling reason to decrypt the
data (e.g, Tessera files containing vital health or safety data when the
primary key older cannot be located, or encrypted files at issue in
a civil lawsuit).

My usage of the term "intercept" was thus a bit unfortunate and was
included only to follow the language of the key escrow announcements.

security and law enforcement omitted]

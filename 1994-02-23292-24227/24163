You missed one thing.  In step 4, the proof of 3-colorability is a zero-
knowledge proof.  It does not disclose any information about the 3-coloring,
not even in an information-theoretic sense.

The 3-colorability proof is zero-knowledge for the following reason:
From the verifier's point of view, each time the protocol is executed,
it sees a conversation between it and the prover.  This conversation
has randomized elements in it and can be encoded as a string.  So
in participating in the protocol, the verifier "samples" one of the 
many possible conversations distributed according to a certain distribution.
The crucial observation here is that this exact distribution of conversation
can be generated _alone_ by the verifier, without the help of the prover.
So the verifier didn't gain anything from the interaction.

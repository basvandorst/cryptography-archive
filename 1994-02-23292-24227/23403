Hi all,
	I'm looking for seminal papers that can be retrieved via FTP or Gopher 
dealing with the subject of cryptography in general and more specifically 
modern methods like DES,public key cryptography, Digital Signatures etc 

	I have looked at the FAQ and will look through the FTP sites mentioned
there, but would be grateful for pointers to any specific papers that might be
particularly useful in illustrating the technical points of the various 
methods.


thanks a lot,
	alex mallet.

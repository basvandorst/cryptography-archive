   It has to be trivial.  The receiving chip can not check the LEAF.
   It does not have the group key for your chip group, or the 
   master key for your chip. 
   So for sure you can just trash the LEAF.    How silly.

That's incorrect.  Each chip has the Family Key in it, which lets it
generate the LEAF, and the LEAF includes some sort of checksum
which lets the receiving chip validate that it is, in some sense, ok.
You can't just trach the chip.  On the other hand, it doesn't have the
unique key for your chip, so it can't tell who you are.

However, if you have a programmable CLipperphone, you *could* encrypt
the LEAF on transmission and let the receiver decrypt it before
feeding it to the Clipper, if both phones are programmed to do it.
CAPSTONE makes that much harder, since it's probably doing the key
exchange for you, unlike pure Clipperphones which have to do that part
themselves.  Will the NSA approve a user-programmable Clipperphone?
Not likely :-)

	My understanding is that Spread spectrum is having a very broad channel (just 
the opposite of what we try to do by having a very sharp center frequency) and varying 
the amplitued a very tiny amount.  If you are prepared to receive the correct portion 
of the band, and integrate the apparent noise, you get a signal out.

	What you have described is called either frequency hopping or fast frequency
hopping (depending on if you hop more or less than once per bit).  

	I was told that the advantage to both is that they are jamming resistant, and
it is difficult to tell that they (or at least spread spectrum) are being used without
prior knowlege.

	I don't work with either, so don't take this as absolute.

A few suggestions if you run into them again:

The key escrow with the XOR protections should be done the following
way:

To obtain a key an agent would have to present evidence to two seperate
juries of people randomly selected from the jury pool of the area.
These juries would sit in a building where they could physically witness
all access to the vaults containing the keys. Upon leaving at the end
of the day each juror would apply a physical seal to the vault, and would 
be free to pay random inspections at any time to the site.

If both juries allowed the release of a key then they would be XOR'd
together and could be used. 

After some amount of time (a few months) all key releases would be
published, and unless convicted of a crime the "victim" of the release
would have there chip replaced free of charge. In the event of a long
investigation both juries permission would be required to keep the tap
secret.

The juries would be replaced frequently to avoid the danger of jurors
being "bought" by either side.

If this system was in place I would feel fairly comfortable with products
that used the chip. Otherwise I would have to assume that there might
be some Ollie North clone on some crazy crusade decrypting everything.

On a related note:  can anyone cite specific cases of someone (anyone,
not just the NSA) monitoring Internet traffic, or of snagging packets?
This has become important to me lately because of people beginning to
do things like send credit reports via the Internet.  Since my credit
card numbers are on my credit report, I don't think this is appropriate
due to the privately/independently owned nodes of the Internet, and the
inherent lack of security involved.

I hope to put together a well-documented case for why credit reports
and other such sensitive information should not be allowed to be transmitted
un-encrypted on the Internet.  If anyone can supply me with information
that would be helpful, I'd appreciate it.

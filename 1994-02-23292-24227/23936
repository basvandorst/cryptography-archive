After William Safire recent NYT article criticizing clipper, I purchased
on of his books named 'Safire's New Political Dictionary.' Random House
1993.

Under the entry on 'totalitarianism' is the citation by Walt Whitman Rostow
(advisor to the Johnson Administration):

"A totalitarian regime...can be defined as a state in which the potentialities
for control over society by governmental authority are exploited to the limit
of available modern techniques..."

The above quote was written in 1952, anticipating the founding of the NSA.

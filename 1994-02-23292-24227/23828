There is one fundamental problem with One-Time Pad Cyphers/Vernam 
technique that hasn't been noted so far (as I'm aware) in this 
interaction. It is due to the fundamental property of the XOR 
operation that is used to hide the plaintext in the keystream. 
 
Although the cipher system itself is fundamentally secure from 
attack (assuming thermionic random number generators), it is 
_not_ secure against tampering.  
 
Consider the case of a banking application where a fixed format 
message is regularly transmitted that refers to account numbers 
and sums of money.  If the tamperer knows the message format and 
the digits involved, then the keystream for that part of the 
message is obvious - and other digits may be substituted.  
 
This problem applies to all stream ciphers (AFAIK) and is one 
reason why block ciphers (DES, IDEA etc) are preferred.  It can 
be overcome by use of digital signatures but should be registered 
as a caveat to those wishing to design stream ciphers.

Suppose I have a hard drive I wish to export from the USA.  
It has some export-controlled crypto software on it (eg UNIX-lookalike
with DES libraries and crypt(1)).  How much effort do I have to make to 
erase the software before it's acceptable to export the drive?

The drive is broken.  I cannot erase the data.  (A charred component
with the case crumbled away gives a strong hint it's not going to fix
itself.) A well-known disk drive manufacturer claims they will send the 
drive to Singapore and erase the data and "re-manufacture" the drive 
when I return it (to some place in the USA, I hope) to have it replaced 
under warranty.  Since the problem reading the data was intermittent 
before it became solid, I expect the data will be recoverable.
Oh, yes, there's also commercial software I would erase if I could.

I warned a customer service person of the situation.  They didn't 
seem concerned.  Who's in legal trouble here?

   Hmmm.  Why bother with Clipper at all?  Encrypt the data with a non-
escrowed algorithm.  Or, if you believe that Skipjack is the only algorithm
that the NSA can't break, and you want to keep something from them, why
not superencrypt the whole Skipjack output stream with another algorithm,
such as IDEA in CFB mode?

   Sideline Note:  I agree with your point about AT&T, and boycotting their
products (and letting them know why).  It's a pity, because AT&T is basically
(from what I've seen) a top-notch company, other than selling their potential
customers out on this issue.  AT&T has people who know better--who know
enough to realize that escrowed keys as described thus far are a gaping
security hole.  I'd sooner use a phone with FEAL-8 in CFB-mode--at least
the known attacks are challenging, requiring more than a *single* Federal
judge who's either sympathetic to all law enforcement requests, no matter
how questionable, or who's on the take.  (Depending on whether you're a
police officer or a criminal.)  They're selling their customers, who trust
them because of their expertise in communications and com. security,
snake oil.

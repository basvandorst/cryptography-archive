The problem with a disk erasing facility is that many of the sites
that need to erase disks so that they don't compromise secure data
are themselves secure.  The disk may not be able to leave the room,
vault, whatever until erased or effectively destroyed.  And as soon as
you open that HDA outside a clean room, you can probably write off
the media for being useful to the casual user.

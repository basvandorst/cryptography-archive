This isn't enough plaintext--you need 3+5+7+...+23 bytes.

I think 3+5+7+...+23.
All the same, Paul Rubin's proposed attack sounds good to me.

Other ideas may come from considering a much weaker related system
which I broke a few years ago by what I
call a 'forbidden plaintext attack'.  The methods for breaking
the Nihilist substitution given in the Helen Gaines book _Cryptanalysis_
include the same idea.

The system:

1.  Remove all non-alphabetic characters. Make all letters become 
upper-case.
2.  Replace A by 01, B by 02, ... ,Z by 26.
3.  Mod 10 add two repeating keys of differerent lengths to
    this.

I solved this for two keys of lengths about 40 digits each. The
GCF of the two key lengths was 2.  The method was based on 
looking at ciphertext digits in odd positions, which had to correspond
to numerical plaintext (after step 2) of 0, 1, or 2.
The other digits are 'forbidden'.  If you look at digits in positions
x, x+L1, x+L2, x+L1+L2 and call the ciphertext digits a,b,c,and d,
the 'cross-difference' a-b-c+d is not changed by the encryption.
If it is 4 or 6, there is only one choice of key.  Exploiting this
and similar ideas, including the forbidden combinations 00,27,28,29,
led to a solution.

While this was a deliberately weakened puzzle system, it may shed
some light.  In particular, if Bosch's system is used for a message
much longer than the LCM's of two subsets of his wheel sizes such that
their union is the whole set of wheel sizes, then we can ignore the
additional structure and consider two wheels whose sizes are these
LCM's.  While XOR does not allow the often forbidden bytes 128-255
to be used to deduce lower bits in the key (unlike the puzzle system)
the cross-differences still may be an interesting idea.  I suspect
that an unknown plaintext attack, while beyond me, may be high-end
puzzle stuff rather than a strong cipher.

Hi. I'm looking for a few scripts that will allow to easily use  nested
encrypted and multiple remailers. I had a copy of something
called pop.send and pop.mail that I got off of the soda ftp site.

The problem was it would just lock up if I picked anything other
remailers that didn't support encryption. Tried looking for any problems
with script, but didn't see anything that would cause problems. Tried
copying pgp directly into my Mail dir, still no dice. 

So..to make a long story short, anyone have any useful scripts? Doing this
stuff manually is pretty slow.

Thanks,

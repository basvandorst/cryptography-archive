There are algorithms for answering the question "is N prime" that can
give you an answer with an arbitrarily small probability of being incorrect.
I.e. you don't have to actually check all the factors below N to be pretty
damn sure that N is prime.

There are more advanced algorithms than this one, but I think this is the
basic idea on all of them:

	If N is prime, then x^(N-1) = 1 mod N.
	where x < N, so take a whole bunch of x's and test them.
	if you ever an x where this is not true, N is not Prime.
	The more x's you find where this is true, the higher the probability
	that N is is prime.

      This is bad advice.  The difficulty of factoring has to do with
      the size of the second largest factor, not with the number of factors.

   Wrong.

   The difficulty of factoring, using the best available algorithms, is
   independent of the size of the factors.

I think its crucial to point out that no one actually KNOWS what the
complexity of factoring is -- we only know what the complexity of the
current algorithms happens to be. There is no provable lower bound on
the complexity of factoring -- yet.

I'm sure most of the participants in this discussion know this, but
some of the lurkers might not.

Otherwise reasonable people who understand that wishing will not make
rocks levitate often believe, in effect, that a well-intentioned government
program can successfully violate the laws of economics. This irrational
and almost religious belief in government is the root of our tragedy.

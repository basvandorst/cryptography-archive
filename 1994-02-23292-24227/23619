	   Was Lincoln a bad guy, then?

Overall, I'd say he was.  He did a few good things, like freeing slaves,
which could have been accomplished other ways.  But he also declared
war on what was formerly half the country, killing hundreds of thousands 
of people in the name of nationalism and federal power, greatly
increased the power of the government over the people and the states,
and radically violated and ignored the Constitution, exercising powers
that were not granted to him by either the people or the states and
violating the rights of citizens.  I'd call that bad.  Popular, but bad.

Check out swIPe in:

@inproceedings{swipeimpl,
	author = "John Ioannidis and Matt Blaze",
	title = "{The Architecture and Implementation of Network-Layer
		Security Under Unix}",
	booktitle = "{Fourth Usenix Security Symposium Proceedings}",
	organization = "Usenix",
	month = "October",
	year = 1993}

available for anonymous ftp from research.att.com:/dist/mab/swipeusenix.ps.

Also available there is the internet-draft specifying the swIPe
protocol (research.att.com:/dist/mab/swipe.id).

I wrote code for swIPe about a year ago, but haven't had time since to
clean it up; I will be doing that some time soon, so watch this space
for an announcement.

Subject: 16 round DES broken
Precedence: list
To: eff-talk@eff.org (eff-talk mailing list)

Clipped from the cypherpunks list:

On Jan. 27, at the Japanese Conference on Cryptography and Information
Security, Mitsuru Matsui of Mitsubish presented a known plaintext
attack on the full 16-round DES.  It requires  2^43 plaintext-ciphertext
pairs, and breaks the scheme in 50 days on 12 HP9735 workstations.

This is a major step forward in the attack of DES as a valid cypher.

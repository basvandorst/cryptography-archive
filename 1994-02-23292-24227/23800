I have read a tale of the British tapping into a phone line outside
the French embassy in London and recovering the clear text from the
encrypted communication to Paris during the Suez Canal crisis.  That
was quite a while ago.  The French fed clear text from a teletype
paper tape to a cypher machine to another teletype that generated the
encrypted signal.  They were unable to affect the outcome of the crisis.

Another time they were out with a radio direction finding van and were
able to hear the received signal on the local oscilator of the
receiver.  They did not figure out that the bad guy must have been the
other car in the parking lot where they were waiting until he had
left.

I believe these tales and other equally interesting ones were in a book
called "Spycatcher."

On the other hand, an A. C. Nielson audience meter installer I chatted
with at an electronics store, said it is hard to tell what people are
watching even when they let him open up their gear and tap in a few
wires and other nonstandard bits.

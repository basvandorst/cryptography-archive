What limitations will be placed on this application interface before the
chips are made available?  It strikes me that this would be a good way for
whoever does the approving to specify that double encryptions isn't allowed
(how they would enforce that might be tricky for some areas though).
 
Will clipper chips be legally exportable?  I wonder whether we'll start
getting dodgy clipper phones here if it catches on?

Keeping in mind that TEMPEST refers to the defensive measures necessary
to prevent snooping of electromagnetic emissions, I don't believe that
TEMPEST is illegal.  It's basically just sheilding.  In fact, just last
week I was flipping through a catalog here at work, and TEMPEST cabinets
are available by mail-order.  The governments standards may be
classified, but the equipment is certainly not illegal.

As far as this type of surveilance being legal, why would it be illegal? 
Your computer emits certain spurious signals, and someone else happens to
pick them up.  No big deal.  If you don't want people to listen in on
something, don't broadcast it over the radio.

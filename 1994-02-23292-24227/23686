In the U.S., there is a commercial version called ViaCrypt PGP, which so far
is only available in a DOS version. As far as anyone knows that's legal for
ownership and use in the U.S. but not for export without a Government export
license (not to be confused with a patent license from the patent holders).

Other versions of PGP are asserted to be an infringement of the patents of
MIT and Stanford held by Public Key Partners, in the U.S. They are also
illegal to export without an export license. The company making ViaCrypt PGP
has got a license from the patent holders but not an export license from the
government.

Outside the U.S. the PKP patents aren't valid (unless the new GATT agreement
changes this), and thus they are legal where national law permits them.
However, there is apparently a federal Grand Jury investigation about just
how they got outside the U.S. and whether there were any violations of U.S.
law here as part of that. This might affect some inside the U.S.

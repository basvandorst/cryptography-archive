This certainly seems sound.  

But here's an implementation question:
If this is a sector-level encryptor, and you propose
to store the IV rather than compute it from known information
(i.e., the sector number--of course, the plaintext is not known
to the decryptor!), where are you going to store it?

There's no unused space sitting around in the average sector.
Maintaining a separate index seems to be the answer, but it
would make me feel uneasy about the robustness of the implementation.

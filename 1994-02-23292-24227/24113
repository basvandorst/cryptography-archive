If you're worried about absolute security, then factoring of large numbers
is probably your best bet.  If you want something more secure than RSA, just
modify the algorithm to use more than two factors, and include the source
along with your public-key (costly but necessary unless you get it to be
fairly widely implemented).  Most other systems, such as DES, can be reduced
to a system of non-linear equations in a fixed number of unknowns.  It seems
more likely to me that factoring will prove to be a much more difficult
technique to make efficient.


BTW, what's your real name?  I doubt that you're a pirate philosopher.

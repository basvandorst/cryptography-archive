	Whoops.  Error in previous post regarding secure phone.  Seems one
does _not_ need as much as 56K bips to encode speech.  There are numerous
compression methods, and quality could also be "shaved".
	I'm too used to thinking in the area of telephony.  (T1 being 24
channels of 56K bips data, making 1.544 Mbips, etc, etc.)
	This is still an interesting idea...

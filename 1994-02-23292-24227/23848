Hello All,

I'm posting to ask if some generous cryptographers would call or e-mail me
to make sure I have a proper perspective on a story now in progress. I'm
writing about DES busting, and specifically a paper delivered by Michael
Wiener, at Crypto '93. I'm with a major Canadian daily newspaper, and
Wiener works just down the road from me. You can call collect.

Thanks in advance,

--

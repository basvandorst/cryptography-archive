I understand this method is still used today to catch pay TV pirates.  In
our area, they used to send out pay TV programming on a 2.4 Ghz. band, and
rent down-converters to paying customers.  Some "enterpreneurs" started
selling similar devices of $100 or less, and the number of paying
subscribers dropped off drastically to the point where they estimated that
only 10% of their audience consisted of paid subscribers.

The solution was to equip a vehicle with a sensitive receiver and cruise up
and down the streets listening for local oscillators on the correct
frequency.  At least, that's what we were TOLD the solution was.  It
certainly would have been POSSIBLE, but then again they may have only been
bluffing.

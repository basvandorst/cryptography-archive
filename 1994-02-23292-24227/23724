[query for English stats]

This is the heart of amateur crypto.  I like the collection of stats
in _Cryptanalysis for Microcomputers_ by Caxton Foster.  It is based
on the Brown Corpus that Grady Ward mentions.

Unfortunately, the book is out of print.  Still you might find it
in a university library.

Another source is _Elementary Cryptanalysis_ by Helen Fouche Gaines.
This is available in a Dover paperback.  You might have to order it.
Its stats are not as nice as Foster's, but it has served a couple of
generations of amateurs.

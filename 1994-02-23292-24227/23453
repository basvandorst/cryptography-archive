Really, you are entitled to take any attitude you want, but you
have chosen one that has proven foolhardy for many cryptography
users throughout history.

From "The American Codebreakers" by Thomas Parrish (Scarborough
House 1991), p. 119:

   ...every day at the same time came the message about the same kind
   of subject matter.  This was the weather report... "It was usually
   easy to break not only because of the timing, which told you what
   key it was, but because if it was going to be cloudy, rainy or fair,
   they would start off with the standard phrase for it.  Of course,
   sitting in Bletchley Park, you didn't know what the weather was in
   Heidelberg, but you knew it as going to be rainy or snowy or whatever."
   This fact gave the cryptanalyst a good chance of getting a peek
   through the ciphertext into a bit of the plaintext--a crib, it
   was called... The code-breakers depended on human errors by the
   Germans, and the use of standard phrases was one of the enemy's
   most helpful ones.
     Another kind of regular crib had long been provided by a German officer
   who had sat out in the North African desert faithfully reporting to his
   superiors, every day, that he had nothing to report.  In such cases,
   Welchman wished he could "ask the British commanders to be sure to
   leave our helper alone."

Considerably more examples along these lines can be found in the same book.

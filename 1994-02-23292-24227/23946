	Actually, I'm having a little difficulty in understanding how it would
be possible for the statement to be independant (unprovable).  If it were
unprovable, then couldn't we just assume it as an axiom?  If this were the
case, then I don't see how this could be of any use to us.  Isn't the problem
of proving/disproving P=NP based on polynomial-time solution of NP-complete
problems?  How would one actually go about proving that such a problem is
independant?  I don't see how we could provide models that demonstrate one
way or another that the assumptions would be consistent, since this doesn't
seem to be a problem of Math Logic... 

NOTE:  I'm not saying that I disagree, just that I'm a little confused...
	(Just asking for some clarification -- not arguments).

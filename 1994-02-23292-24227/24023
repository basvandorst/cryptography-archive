Hmm.  Let $p$ be a prime.  To factor $p$, note $p=p\cdot 1$.

We are very concerned in factoring numbers $n=pq$ for $p,q$ prime!!
Such a problem is the crux of RSA!

It might be good to note that if $n=pq$ for $p,q$ prime and
$p\approx q\approx \sqrt{n}$ then the Fermat factoring algorithm
has a good chance of factoring $n$.

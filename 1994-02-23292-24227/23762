Supposing that we set out to build a One Time Pad (OTP) encryption system using
a truly random source to generate OTP data having a length of 1 to 500 MB.  By
using the OTP to encrypt clear text, this finite length will eventually be
consumed and require replenishment.  Can it be proven that any transformation
except one which results in an exact reversal of the original OTP data will, if
applied to the entire OTP, produce essentially random data?  In other words, is
there any way to 'convert' random data back into a predictable state?  Does a
proof exist?

I would greatly appreciate any comments or your thoughts regarding this.  
 
Take care.

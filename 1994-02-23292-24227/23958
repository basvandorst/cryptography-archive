	FWIW, last time I looked, Radar detectors are illegal only in Va.,
Connecticut, and perhaps the District of Colombia.
	How detector illegality jibes with an old FCC assertion that there's
no crime in receiving, only in retransmitting, is beyond me.  BTW, "re-
transmission" of detected radar apparently includes getting on your CB
radio and telling everyone...

I think not.  The suggestion is not a simple test for the right answer,
but an attempt to decrypt with the answer given as the key.  The wrong
answer will yield a bad plain text header and stop the process.  If you
defeat this test, all you get is a program which happily decrypts the good
data ciphertext into a file of pure garbage.  To get the right plain text
you have to either (1) have or guess the right answer (key) or (2) break
the conventional cipher used.  If you can do (2), you can also break
normal PGP messages.

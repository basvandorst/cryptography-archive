A while back i got a program that uses IDEA encryption to encrypt a msdos 
hard disk partion unfrtuently i accidently encrypted the partion that had 
the program on it...I don't recall the name and was wondering if anyone 
know what it was and where i could get it.
Also i was wondering if there was any free or low cost program and 
encrypt a modem connection to a unix host.So no cleartext goes over the 
phones lines.
Please email with your response acct1@fx.net

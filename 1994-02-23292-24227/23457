	That was a bit extreme.

	David may be very outspoken in his arguments--and I've been on the
opposite side of _many_ debates with him--particularly when I was still on
netcom--but to accuse him of a lack of personal integrity as your message 
does is totally inappropriate.

	While I--and many other networkers--totally disagree with many of
David's views and values, few who have debated with him would even consider
depicting him as either insincere or lacking in mental acuity.

	Rick

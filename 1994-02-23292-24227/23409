My father bought Lotus 123 ver 3.1 
My younger brother (14) was the first to open it
and install it. When you first install it it asks
you for your name and company, and my younger brother
of course typed "Craphead" for the name.

Both my father and my brother have looked for "Craphead"
in an effort to change it, and they can't find it.
My father would like to change it to his real name before
he takes it into work. 

I figure that "Craphead" must be encrypted in some file somewhere.
Does anybody know anything about this?

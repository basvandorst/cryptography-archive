There has been a good deal of discussion on the net about cryptography
and proposed or actual government restrictions on it's use.

It appears that in many jurisdictions the use of encryption systems is
becoming frowned upon and indeed the possesion and transmission of
unauthorised cyphertext may become illegal. While it may be some time before
such laws are made and enforced, it is quite likely that sysadmins are going
to start frowning on those that have and transmit unidentified binaries.

As a result, I have been working (in my spare time I would add -- this is
not a project of my employer) on data concealment techniques. The method used
involves burying the 'secret' data in a file with a large amount of
redundancy (currently a .gif, but I'm also considering .exe files and
any other suggestions would be appreciated). This will allow users to
exchange and keep information without revealing it's nature.

This is *not* encryption. I see the package being used to 'bury' a PGP
encoded file. In this case there will be two keys, one to extract the
cyphertext, and one to decrypt it.

Has this been tried before? I'd like any feedback on feasability, since I do
not claim to be a cryptographer. If things progress well, I may have something
for alpha in around 2 weeks. (It's a pretty simple problem). Any potential
testers please mail me.

I hope he keeps posting the errata, I found it useful. Clearly only a few
of the mistakes directly appear to be the fault of Bruce. Some of the
errata are even for things that have happened *since* the book was
published.

I wish other authors would be so keen to issue corrections.

Good on you Bruce.

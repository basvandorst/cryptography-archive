You made no comment regarding division, so I will assume division is 
available.

Simply divide a1a2 by b1.  If the quotient is < b2, then a1a2 < b2b2.
If the quotient is greater than b2, or the quotient is equal and the 
remainder is non-zero, then a1a2>b1b2.  If the quotient equals b2 and the
remainder is zero, then a1a2=b1b2.

If, however, division is NOT available, then this becomes a more interesting
question, and I'll get back to you (maybe)...

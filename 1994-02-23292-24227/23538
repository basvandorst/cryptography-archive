This does not make much sense.  To avoid surveillance you suppress em
radiation from your computer gear.  As far as I know it is quite
legal, even encouraged, to suppress radiation.  A Faraday cage is a
simple and cheap solution even if somewhat more confining than Tempest
hardware, connectors, and the like.

Similarly, genius is not required to figure out what a system might
radiate with usable information on it.  And even less genius is
required to acquire suitable receivers.  Reconstructing the received
signal probably requires custom hardware, but it probably only
slightly more difficult than designing standard circuit cellar stuff.

I strongly suspect that several similar systems in one room would be
an effective jamming system for all but the most determined and
technically adept eavesdroppers.

In the first authentication, an eavesdropper sees :

	V  ---	k0 xor y  --->	P
	   <--  k1 xor y  ----

Impersonating P in the 2nd session is now easy :

	V  ---  k1 xor z  -->    is the new authentication challenge, and
	   <--   y xor z  --- 	 is the required reply.

But this reply can be constructed by xoring the new challenge with the reply
from the previous session, i.e. y xor z = (k1 xor y) xor (k1 xor z).

Essentially, what your protocol does is to use a one-time pad more than once
& hence destroy the security. A good elementary discussion of cryptographic 
protocols (including a very similar example) may be found in James L. Massey's
paper "An Introduction to Comtemporary Cryptology", Proceedings of the IEEE,
76(5), May 1988, page 533.

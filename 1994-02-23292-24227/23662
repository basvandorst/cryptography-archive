This advice is naive and misleading.  Unfortunately, many here think that
you should try to "understand" insubordinate people to whom you have delegated 
your authority.  

Trust abused is trust destroyed.

None of us is under any obligation to try and better understand our subordinates
in the NSA so we can "modify their actions" prior to simply removing our grant of 
authority from them.

I say fire the SOBs, including Sternlight.

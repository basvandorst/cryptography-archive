Hi,

In the first edition of "Numerical Recipes" there was a software implementation
of DES. In the new edition it has been replaced by a different program.  The
primary interest of the authors is the generation of random numbers; but I
was wondering about the strength/weakness of the new algorithm for encryption
as opposed to standard DES.  Could someone enlighten me?

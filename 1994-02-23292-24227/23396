These remarks come with ill grace. From the start there was nothing in the
Clipper press release saying they were going to prohibit alternate
encryption. That was a fear raised here. In response to later questions they
confirmed that they had no plans to do so (within a month of the first
discussion here) and that statement was also quoted here. Those with
anti-government water to carry then tried to pick apart their statement in
that instance. Now we have yet another confirmation.

Now there's nothing wrong with being careful, or questioning the government
closely in this matter, and we are all indebted to those who are vigilant in
the protection of our civil rights. But to make this the occasion of a
sarcastic diatribe does not forward the action.

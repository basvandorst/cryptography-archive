I don't know about AFS, but "international" versions of DCE, which
also use Kerberos authentication, are exportable.  In these versions,
all the symbolic entry points to the DES functions are stripped from
the object files, and the "data privacy" level of security is
disabled.  Strong DES encryption can be used as part of the protocol,
but can't be used or made available for user data encryption.

 I got to wondering about something the other night -

Is Clipper going into public/pay phones, too?  If so, what's to prevent the
Undesirable Elements from simply bouncing around between combinations of
payphones to do their Evil Stuff?  I mean, if Scoundrel "A" calls
Scoundrel "B" from a randomly-chosen payphone, is someone going to have a
master list of payphone keys available, or are they just going to have to
live with not knowing what transpired?

Just wondering.....

This sounds like an excellent idea to me, whether the following encryption
is XOR periodic or not, but it bothers me to be so careful about the
compression and then follow it with encryption that is so easily improved.

I'm thinking of looking at some PKZIP compressed files, unencrypted, to
see if they have many long repeated strings.  They can't have too many
short repetitions, or the compression wouldn't work, but I suspect that,
if the text is shortened by a factor X, then almost all the repeated
strings longer than some threshhold will be shortened by X but still
repeated and still rather long.  If this is true, XOR periodic would be
a particularly bad choice to apply afterwards.  I suspect that ordinary
byte substitution, with a fairly well-mixed table (transposed keyword
mixed as in Sinkov, for instance), would be a lot better.

Compressing with a higher-order model would help even more, but until
the encryption has roughly as much thought put into it as the
compression, the encryption seems easier to improve.

Note that I wrote previously:
::It would be well worth while to use
::a more secure cipher than periodic XOR before compressing, ...
[OOPS!--I meant 'after compressing']
wb alertly writes
: Enciphering *before* compressing defeats the compression.
I couldn't agree more.

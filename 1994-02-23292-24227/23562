   If the government is to use encryption internally for administrative  
   communications and recordkeeping, it is better to have escrowed keys than  
   totally secret keys.  People within government can cause much more damage  
   through rogue secrecy (look at the insane dreck that Oliver North stamped Top  
It's not that straightforward; will the Senate have the keys to
eavesdrop on Ollie North Jr, or will Ollie North Jr have the keys to
eavesdrop on the Senate?  And will the IRS be eavesdropping on the
President's financial conversations, or will the President's Men be
eavesdropping on the IRS to get tax records from the Enemies List?

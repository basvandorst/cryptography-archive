And if you are interested in DES, SHS, or MD5 source code, you
might want to ftp the file DES_SHS_MD5.tar.Z from /pub/grady
at site netcom.com. I've collected some excellent, efficient code
from net contributors.

You must be a resident of the United States or Canada to download.
If you are in Canada, you will need an 'export declaration' attached
for customs, but I haven't figured out how to affix the stamp yet.

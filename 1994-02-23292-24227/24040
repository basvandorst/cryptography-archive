You have missed DC erase. There will still be remnant magnitization
at the lower levels of the oxide layer that the HF erase patterns
won't saturate.

In addition, you have not done anything effective about track offsets.

Against a full, cost-no-object attack, you are gaining only very little,
if any, extra security after the first couple of patterns.

The requirements for full erasure where worked out in the 40s/50s. You
must have a field that; 1)covers ALL the media, 2)FULLY saturates
the entire layer all the way through, 3)is reversed for several hundred
cycles.

That is why tape recorders have separate erase heads. Your scheme
fails on criteria 1 and 2. It is also not GARENTEED to meet 3.

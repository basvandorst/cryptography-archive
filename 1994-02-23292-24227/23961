P=NP could be unprovable yet true if there was a polynomial-time
algorithm for solving, e.g., the traveling salesman problem, which
WORKED without us being able to PROVE it worked.   We might even be able
to see that it worked in lots and lots of cases, but be clueless as to
proving it worked in general.

On the other hand, P=NP could be unprovable yet false, and that actually
seems a more realistic alternative, since it sure seems false, yet
nobody has been able to prove that.

Yes, but it might not be true.  E.g., pretty much everyone would agree
the Goedel sentence is *true* (in the standard interpretation of the
axioms of arithmetic), but one can consistently assume its negation
along with the axioms of arithmetic; when one is doing that, one is
choosing to work in a nonstandard model.  Nonstandard models can be
explicitly described and they are weird.

P=NP is very much a problem of mathematical logic; as for how one could
go about showing it is independent, I don't think anyone really has a
clue.  (Though there are people who are a hell of a lot better at
proving things independent than I am.)

Has anyone considered what this pervasive surveillance would do to any of
the "vote by phone" schemes?  Can you imagine democracy where all the votes
were no longer secret -- and probably not secure, either?

The saying goes that "power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely."
When we think of this bill, we should remember (for example) J. Edgar Hoover,
Watergate, and Perot's tendency to investigate everything and everyone (can
you imagine this network in the hands of a Pres. Perot?).  Frightening.  This
bill reminds me of King George and his idea to quarter Redcoats in the houses
of colonial politicians.  What we have here is the beginning of the ultimate
police state. (I just read the _Wired_ article about driver's licenses and
state databases yesterday.  Now I recall that the health care initiative will
probably put all our health records into this surveillance system, along with
our new national ID cards.  And PCS telephone services allowing anytime, any-
where calling will enable anytime, anywhere monitoring.  And EFT will probably
be surveilled, allowing the government to determine the state of your bank
account at any time.  And the list goes on....)

Concerted action in the past few days managed to demolish the house bill that
would have required home schooling parents to be licensed by the state.  If
the home schooling lobby can do that, surely the inhabitants of net space can
overcome this Digital Telephony bill, and maybe even the Clipper non-escrow
provisions.

Remember: Just say NO! to government surveillance.

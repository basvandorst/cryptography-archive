   Traffic analysis is trivial, I believe, given a Clipper crypto system.

Wait!  That's a technical comment!  Isn't this alt.flames.crypto? :-)

If the government's description of the LEAF-1 are accurate,
and there's no guarantee they are since the details are classified,
you need the FBI\b\b\b Family Key to decrypt the LEAF before 
you get the serial number.  This means you either need the NSA Black Box
or alternatively the key and the algorithms to do traffic analysis,
and all that gets you is the serial numbers of the boxes at the two
ends of the conversation; you still have to determine what those are.
 
On the other hand, I didn't *notice* anything in the government's
postings about what Great Care they're going to take of the escrowed
key-halves that said what the rules were for accessing or using the
Family Key ---- perhaps there aren't any?  Anybody want to file a
quick, hopefully embarassing, FOIA request?  Maybe traffic analysis
really *does* become simple, at least for overseas calls which the NSA
supposedly monitors.

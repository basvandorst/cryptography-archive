I don't know about monitoring the picture, but you can tell which channel
they are watching.  In the UK tv users need licenses, this is enforced by
people with detection equipment, (usually in trucks, but portable stuff
exists).  Colour TV's tend to use standard components, and hence a
standard internal i.f. (intermediate frequency).  Tuning the tv to a
specific channel causes the the tv to generate (and emit) a difference
signal, between the fixed i.f. and the tuned channel - hence indicating
which channel is tuned.  A directional antenna and appropriate receiver
should be able to distinguish the frequency of the emitted signal.

(Disclaimer; I'm not an expert on tv electronics, even less so on NTSC
systems - so I can't give much more detail on this).

Depends on what you're doing.  In a paper I wrote a few years ago
(research.att.com:/dist/smb/neke.ps), there's a requirement for some
*really* random numbers -- and anything non-random leaks information
to the adversary.  With enough samples -- and enough depends on how
far from uniform the distribution is skewed -- the attacker can crack
the protocol.

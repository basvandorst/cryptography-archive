	I have to determine the relation between their products.
	Namely whether 

	     a1.a2 > b1.b2   

	without actually carrying out the multiplication of a1,a2 and b1,b2.
	The multiplication gives integer overflow because of large
	values of variables.
	Is there any way of doing this?

I'd take the Gordian Knot-cutting approach: use an extended precision
maths package such as the one pgp uses.

If there are strong arguments why that's not practical, tell us a
little more about the constraints and we'll see what we can come up with.

PS If the answers are *always* going to be significantly different (ie
by a factor of >2) you could get away with just adding the log_2's of
the numbers and comparing the sums.  And you get the log_2 of a binary
number trivially by finding the position of the leftmost set bit.  I've
seen this technique used for speed in video games before when using dot
products as an approximation to vector products to determine which way
an object is facing.
PS I'm not sure sci.crypt is the best group for this question.

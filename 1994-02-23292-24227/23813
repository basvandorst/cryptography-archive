Fruit of the tainted tree, here.  This chain will come out when the defense
cross-examines the arresting officer about probable cause: why were they
following B and why did they arrest him.  In this case, getting the keys
without authorization may be easier than bugging A's house or tapping his phone
without a warrent, but the principle is not different.

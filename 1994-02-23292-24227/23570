I rasied this issue at the NSA presentation.  On the one hand, you need the
Family key (which is split in the same XOR manner as the escrow keys
and held by two different agents of the law enforcement agency).  Also,
there's no a priori mapping of chip IDs to people, although with enough
traffic (and the family key) you could probably construct a list of the
people you were interested in over time.

On the other hand, traffic analysis becomes easier in the sense the
key ID is sent "in band", along with the traffic itself.  So the (well
funded) adversary need not compromise the (possibly better protected)
signaling channel to collect traffic patterns.

:A frequency hopping system, such as you describe can be detected.  Direct

:be looking for it.

From a very good source (Dixon book?) I've read that direct sequence SS is
not hard to detect, its actually easy.  Its hard to *RECOGNIZE* as a signal
as opposed to noise.  On a spectrum analyzer it shows up as a general
increase in the noise level.

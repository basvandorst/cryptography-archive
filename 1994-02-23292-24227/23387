Use PGP. "Very secure" if used correctly, completely legal in the UK
and Europe, offers symmetric ("conventional") or public key encryption.

Free too. Available by anonymous FTP from

ftp.demon.co.uk:/pub/pgp/pgp23A.zip (DOS executables) or pgp23srcA.zip in
the same directory (source code).

The lastest PKZIP appears to have reasonably good encryption, but it's
primarily a compression utility, not an encryption tool. Use PGP (it also
does compression, but doesn't construct archives like PKZIP).

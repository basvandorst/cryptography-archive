That's my understanding, based on my reading of the FIPS for key escrow
that was posted last year and a few comments that were made at the
meeting.  No pre- or post- encryption, you must transmit the LEAF field,
etc.   It's not at all clear how they could enforce this with Capstone
(which is programmable) or Tessera (Capstone on a removable PCMCIA card),
especially when these devices are installed in general purpose PCs.

I suspect the chips themselves will not be exportable outside of
"approved products", but according to what the White House said yesterday,
there will be "streamlined procedures" for approving the export
of devices that include key escrow.  Of course, it's not at all clear
there's much of an export market for these products (or even a domestic
market, but that's another matter)...

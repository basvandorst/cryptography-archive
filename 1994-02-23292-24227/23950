Actually, you were clear, I just hadn't read you post carefully

So law enforcement potentially has three sources for escrow-encrypted 
data:

1) Court-ordered wiretaps, searches, etc.
2) National intelligence data
3) Data freely supplied by somebody.

The treatment of category (3) is indeed an interesting question.

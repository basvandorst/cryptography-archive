I used to work for a government agency involved in TEMPEST related
operations.  I had an HP 2645 terminal on my desk inside a steel
box with wire mesh covering the screen.  The keyboard was also
inside a steel box with the ketops glued to wooden sticks though
small holes to depress the original switch mechanism innside.
Needless to say, the ergonomics of the 2645 imprisioned in its
TEMPEST garb weren't too exciting.  This was 15 years ago.  At that
time, the 2645 was a TEMPEST retrofit and new equipment was just
becoming available with inherently low TEMPEST leakage.

Intercepting stuff right off the video terminal was and probably
still is in most cases ridiculously easy with just a few hundred
dollars of components about the size of a construction worker's
lunch box.  I know because that is what we used in a dog and pony
show to convince users that TEMPEST exploitation was a real
security concern.  In fact, intercepting was so easy on old TTYs
and CRTs that users often thought I was faking the demonstrtation.

I wouldn't count on the RF caucophony of a computer room covering
up the TEMPEST escaping from your terminal.  A resonably good
operator can hone in on a signature unique to your equipment pretty
easily.  I could usually do it and I was by no means an expert.

There are US Military and NATO standards that specify limits.  The
Military limits are to the best I know still classified.  TEMPEST
used to be a classified concept, but that has since changed.  The
KBG/GRU or whatever has replaced those agencies in the CIS are
aware and have a similar set of standards.  In fact, the Soviet
Union is generally believed to be the first, employing TEMPEST
intercepts in intelligence operations in the 1950s.

I've heard some interesting James Bond sort of stories about both
cold war blocks breaking into each others offices and clipping
capacitors or removing shields to improve the TEMPEST yeild of the
other guy's equipment.  Us watching them, watching us, watching
them, ....

If I understand things correctly it means that the blocks aren't
secured against rearranging.  Each 1024-byte block encoded with the
same key can be substituted for any other 1024-byte block.  This leads
to the possibility that an intruder could rearrange a document to say
something completely unintended.

It would be nice if any tampering with the blocks would also
invalidate any subsequent block.  Some sort of chaining between blocks
would fix this.

A second problem is that even with chaining, an intruder could
substitute whole replacement files in a "playback" attack.  If the
intruder knew that a certain file contained a favorable encrypted
message, he could copy this file to some other file that contained a
message he wanted to modify.  Adding the block number, inode number,
partition number and disk number into the cipher equation would also
secure the files against this type of attack.

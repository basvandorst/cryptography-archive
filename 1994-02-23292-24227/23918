I think you are incorrect.  There have been several cases where drug dealers
were convicted because of the information monitored from celluar calls.  No
search warrent required either.

The Suprem Court has ruled several time that anything put into the public
airwaves is free for the taking (receiving).  This is why premimum TV
programs  (HBO, etc.) satelite broadcasts are encoded.

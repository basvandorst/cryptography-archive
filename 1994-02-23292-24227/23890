And people laugh at me when I suggest the use of PUBLIC key
encryption for personal files on one's hard disk! They must
not have important files to worry about, or have their entire
hard disk encrypted with some simple utility. Listen people,
if you are only encrypting a few files, public key encryption
solves the problem of having to so VERY carefully type those
passwords. And NO, PGP doesn't ask you to type it twice,
and besides why the hell go through typing a long password
twice every time you want to encrypt something? If you have
a laptop with a sleep feature, having your password sitting
there, memorized, until you quit the encryption program
is just like not using encryption at all. Public key encryption
is very practical for encrypting a few files on your floppies
and hard disk.

I am though interested in what people's criticisms to this
might be (be nice! ;-) ).

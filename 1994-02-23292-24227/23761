Hi,

maybe a FAQ, but:
What kind of evidence is there to support the conjecture that
factoring numbers N=p*q, p,q prime, is at least as difficult 
as the general factorization problem?

Is it "just" the current state-of-the-art that suggests those
numbers are at least as difficult to factor than random 
integers of the same length?

In most descriptions/discussions of the RSA algorithm (including
a FAQ list posted here), it is noted that unfortunately there is  no  
proof yet that *factoring* can not be done efficiently, but that 
mathematicians for centuries have tried in vain to produce an efficient 
*factoring* algorithm.  However, would such a proof be relevant to RSA, 
unless we can prove that * factoring N=p*q  * is hard? 

Thanks in advance,
Heinz-Bernd Eggenstein

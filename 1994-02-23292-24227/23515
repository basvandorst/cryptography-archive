Eric Young's DES library (libdes 3.01) is very fast and includes an 
implementation of crypt(3).  

anon ftp from psych.psy.uq.oz.au (or is it ftp.psy.uq.oz.au).

It was also posted to comp.sources.misc in October 1993 (volume 40), 
so you should also be able to get it from any of the usual archive 
sites. 

If anyone is interested, I have patches to get libdes compiled on 
termios based systems (very easy to do, but if you want them I can 
send them).

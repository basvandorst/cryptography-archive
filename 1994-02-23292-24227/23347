The English had a machine called "Typex"  (or maybe that's "Type X") which
they modified to do decryptions of Enigma encrypts once the keys had been
found by other means.  The Germans had a teletypewriter machine (T-52 or
Geheimschreiber) which the English decrypted with a machine made out of
telephone switches once the keys had been found.  [source: "Code Breakers
The Inside Story of Bletchley Park", Hinsley & Stripp eds. Oxford U.
Press, 1993]

The U.S. had a machine called "sigaba" that I'm aware of.  They also had a
teletypewriter machine that combined a text stream and a key stream by
exclusive-OR-ing corresponding bits of the two streams.  The key stream
could come from a key generator (probably similar to Geheimschreiber) or
from a one-time tape.  The one-time tape is of course perfectly secure if it
is produced by a truly random process; it has the disadvantage of requiring
as much key as there is text, and of having to get the key tapes to both
ends of the circuit.

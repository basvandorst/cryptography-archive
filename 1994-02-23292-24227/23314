I wish to thank everybody who responded to my request for information 
concerning a random number generator constructed in hardware.
 
I received too many replies to make individual acknowledgments.  All were 
appreciated.
 
I would still value replies which included information of a detailed
character 
for the construction of such a generator.
 
George Foot

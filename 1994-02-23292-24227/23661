In a democracy, government officials represent me as well as you. Decisions
will be based not only on what you want, but on the interests of others,
including that group interest often referred to as the "national interest."
Thus if you have a view to contribute and want to engage in getting it taken
account of, you better be able to express it into that context effectively.
You cannot do so by yelling and screaming. You can only do so by making sure
your arguments are effective with the listeners, and for them to be
effective they must take account of the views of others the listeners also
"represent" and deal with those views effectively.

The notion that government officials are "insubordinate" because they don't
do what a particular citizen wants but rather take account of the views of
others as well boggles the mind.

1.  Traffic analysis.  A number of Perry Mason episodes utilize telephone
records to implicate someone in a murder.  A telephone call which occurs
from a particular phone to another particular phone lasting a certain
amount of time can look extremely bad.  (We've already seen this in the
case of Tonya Harding.)  A jury is likely to believe the worst, unless
one can play back the actual conversation to show that it was innocent.
To foil traffic analysis does one have to make random calls to random
places all the time?

2.  Anonymous mailers.  How can they work, unless the mailer on your
own machine cooperates?  Couldn't your own machine's communication lines
be tapped?  Can something like this be used for secret online voting?
For double-blind network interviewing?

3.  What can be done to foil single-stepping a decryption algorithm to
reveal the plain text?  I remember that Multics was compromised by a
crude variant of this approach where a password was placed on a page
boundary and different timings were observed depending upon whether
the key found so far was good.

4.  Although 1024-bit keys are enough for today's records, are they
enough for signatures that have to last generations?  For example,
will future politicians be able to rewrite electronic history by
forging 1990's electronic documents?

5.  What do you say to people who say "but _I_ don't have anything to
hide"?

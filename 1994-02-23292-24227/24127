My understanding of how zero-knowledge proofs work:
Say, for example that you know the Hamilton cycle in a graph.

1. Transform the problem to an instance of SAT (Cook's theorem).

2. Transform the problem to an instance of 3-SAT.

3. Transform 3S to (e.g.) instance of 3-colorability graph where
this graph is 3-colorable if original graph has a Ham cycle.

4. Using solution to original problem, prove that the
graph is 3-colorable.

My question is, has anyone proven that there is no way to
backtrack to obtain the ham cycle. In other words, how do
we know that this method really is zero knowledge?

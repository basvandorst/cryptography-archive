I think there's a bit confusion here.  P and Q here are not hard to find,
the hard problem here is: recovering P and Q when only their product PQ
is known.  There are very efficient Monte Carlo algorithms for testing
compositeness.  They detect composite numbers with negligible error
probability.  Even if you want 100% certainty, I think there are reasonably
efficient algorithms for _proving_ primeness, for numbers up to a few
hundred bits.  (But, well, I must admit that I don't know much about proving
primeness).

I suspect that given our government!s penchant for overclassifying
everything, that anything that they have left unclassified is public
knowledge as far as they are concerned. Far from demonstrating their
faith in SKIPJACK, it seems more reasonable to assume that they have
given us an algorithm they don!t respect to "protect" data that they
don!t care about, in order to seduce us into using it so that they can
monitor us more easily. 

I am also curious  about the opinion of those more trusting of the NSA
than I as to the strength of SKIPJACK. Do they think that NSA is giving
us a system that they cannot read without the escrowed keys? Seasoned
bureaucratic infighters that they are, they must have considered the
possibility that somewhere down the road the Executive or the Congress
might have said "give the people the good encryption and forget about the
escrowed key business". It strains credulity to think that NSA would be
giving out a system that they could not read *easily* even if the
"laymen" in Congress or the White House failed to understand the NSA's
position. There must be an attack or trapdoor.

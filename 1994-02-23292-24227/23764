A narrow-beam spread-spectrum transmission is probably more resistant
to detection by correlation.  Also, a very long bit sequence (comparble
to the length of the transmission) will help hide the signal from a cross-
correlator.  Spy sattelites use bit sequences that won't repeat for weeks.
Computing a correlation function with such a long bit sequence would 
require colossal amounts of memory and/or storage.  Of course, your 
receiver will need weeks to synchronize, too, unless your tranmitter
is keying off some readily available time base (like WWV or GPSS).

I would take issue with the above statement. The real reason for backward 
compatibility has nothing to do with whether DES is implemented in 
Hardware or software. It is really based more on key management issues 
and the desirability of being able to field "new" crypto applications 
while retaining the ability to be compatible "old" applications which can 
use only a single key. The banking industry, which has historically been 
the principal user and standard-setter for commercial crypto products, 
loves this feature because applications tend to be very long-lived in 
that business, for some reason.

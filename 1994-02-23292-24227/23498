I apologize for asking a dumb questions, but I'm getting confused here.

   1) If I have Clipper, is there any technical obstacle to using software
encryption as well?

   2) If I use Clipper + software crypto, am I any less secure than if I use
the same software crypto alone?

Note: This message is posted to sci.crypt and talk.politics.crypto. 
It's probably not the right thread for political comment; if you must be
non-technical, please edit sci.crypt out of the newsgroups line.  Thank
you.

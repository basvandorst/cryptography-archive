I'm not positive, but this sounds familiar to the problem that was analyzed in the 
following paper

`Rivest-Shamir-Adleman Public Key Cryptosystems Do Not Always Conceal Messages'
G.R. Blakley and I. Borosh
Comp. & Maths. with Appls., 
Vol. 5, pp. 169-178
Pergamon Press Ltd. 1979

Sound familiar to anyone else?

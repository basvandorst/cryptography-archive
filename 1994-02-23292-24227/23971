My recollection (possibly wrong) is that the statutes in VA (etc.) are
written so that the detectors per se are not illegal.  However, it's
illegal to operate a motor vehicle which contains a detector.  This is
somewhat analogous to the fact that it's illegal (in most states) to
operate a motor vehicle which contains an open or accessible bottle of
an alcoholic beverage, even though the beverage (and consumption
thereof) is legal in that state.

What!?!?  I'm being obtuse?  Nowhere did I ask about the legality of such
a system.  I asked what YOU'RE opinion was.  In fact, the only way I can
parse the above is by interpreting "do you have any problems with such a
system?" as being equivalent to "Does the USG have any problems with such
a system?"  Ahhh, perhaps we're getting somewhere now.  Sternlight ==
USG.  Hmmm, that would explain a lot.  I seem to recollect the FBI
authorizing money for a campaign to convince the public that more gun
control is needed.  Perhaps ol' "Sternlight" is the product of a similar
campaign.  

Here's my theory.  'David Sternlight' is a fictional entity created by
some agency of the USG for the purposes of helping to get out the
Governments point of view.  This is necessary because virtually no one
outside of the Gov't shares their point of view.  In addition, people
readily discredit the gov'ts point of view when it is labeled as such. 
So, a fictional 'citizen' is created to spout forth the latest State
propaganda.  So, David, if that's your real name, would you care to
answer the following questions?

True or False, the David Sternlight of usenet fame is a fictional entity
(i.e., the name does not correspond to an actual living person.)?

True of False, the person(s) who maintain the Sternlight persona are in
fact current or ex employees of the U.S. Government?

Feel free to lie, the U.S.G. has a long and proud history of lieing.

-David Mitchell (who does exist.)

P.S.  I readily admit that the above question is much like "Have you
stopped beating your wife yet?".  But humor me and answer them anyway.

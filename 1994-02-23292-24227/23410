Transarc Corporation's AFS incorporates much of MIT/Athena kerberos
V4, and has its own tgt generation mechanism. i do not believe MIT
has, or indeed could get, an export license for uncrippled kerberos
even in binary form. what type of agreement does Transarc have with
the Defense and Commerce departments regarding their software? what is
the credential mechanism and structure for the international version
of AFS?

thanks for any info

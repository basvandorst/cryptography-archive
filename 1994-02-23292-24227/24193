It wouldn't normally take long for foreign (or domestic) manufacturers
to clone and bring to market a clipper part through normal reverse
engineering practices (compare, for example, the variety of 386/486
clone parts on the market, most of which are not authorized by Intel).

I suspect that the Skipjack algorithms are patented, and that the
patents are, through patent secrecy laws, not being distributed or
talked about.  This will allow the NSA to effectively outlaw clipper
compatible components through the patent law system, and to restrict
imports of similar technology, again through the patent laws.  To do
so will require the declassification of at least one such clipper
specific patent, but this is a small price to pay for a 17 year
monopoly (from date of declassification) on a (by then) entrenched
encryption technology.  At the end of 17 years, the next patent can be
declassified, etc. effectively tying the clipper compatible crypto
technology up indefinitely, regardless of whether reverse engineering
efforts are successful.  It might even be possible to effectively
control foreign manufacture of Skipjack technology, depending on the
foreign view of our patent secrecy system.

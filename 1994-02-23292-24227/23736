Hi

  I recently found that the file containing the password of the users was 
readable by anyone.  I noticed that the password were encrypted, but I did not
provide a key whene entering my password.  So, shouldn't it be easy for someone
with a little knowledge to find out the key used by the system and decrypt the 
passwords?

  I know it sounds really naive, but I can't figure out how my password is 
protected...

  I've also heard that the passwords were encrypted with the standard 'crypt' 
command on Unix...  So any one can easily decrypt the ciphered passwords at the
moment he gets a hand on the key?  

If all the answers are avalaible somewhere on the net, just point me where...

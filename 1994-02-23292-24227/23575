A frequency hopping system, such as you describe can be detected.  Direct  
Sequence SS can be detected, but it is a much harder problem.  You have to  
be looking for it.

It is a matter of physics.  Is the person who is trying to follow close  
enough to detect your frequency and switch to it before you switch to the  
next frequency?  Is your PR sequence sophisticated enough to prevent the  
other person from reconstructing it?

It will keep out the casual hacker.  Anything you don't want known don't  
say over the air.

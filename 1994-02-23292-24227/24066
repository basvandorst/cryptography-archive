        Absolutely not.  Technically, where you have 'Rights' as
        'Citizens' that are enshrined in a 'Constitution', we have 
        'Liberties' granted us as 'Subjects' of the 'Crown'.

        As far as official information goes, *everything* is a secret
        unless _explicitly_ declassified.  As an example, many years
        ago when I was a kid I did 6 months temporary work in the
        Department of Employment.  If I were to tell you now how many
        paper clips were requisitioned by my department in the time
        that I was there, I would be in breach of Section 2 of the
        Official Secrets Act!

        Maybe this'd better move out of sci.crypt....

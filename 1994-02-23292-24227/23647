Hi.

  I need some code that will allow me to do DES encryption in a Mac
program that I'm writing. A Hypercard XCMD would be ideal, but
something that I could quickly make into one would be fine as well.

  The application will let our students get their grades over the
campus network. We're using kerberos to provide authentication.

  thanks. If you send mail, I'll post the results.

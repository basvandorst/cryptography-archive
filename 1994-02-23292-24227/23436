Where do you get these numbers?  By my calculations:

2^43 Plaintext-Ciphertext pairs * 2^4 bytes/pair = 2^47 bytes

2^47 = 1.407374e14 bytes

Now, how much bandwidth do we need into each computer?

Well, 50 days * 24 hours * 60 minutes * 60 seconds = 4,320,000 seconds

12 computers * 4,320,000 seconds = 51,840,000 CPU*seconds (kinda like
man-hours)

So, 1.407374e14 bytes / 51,840,000 CPU*seconds = 2,714,843.5
Mbytes/CPU*sec.

Well within the range of any modern workstation.  If they are being fed
with
an FDDI network, we get an aggragate network bandwidth of 260 Mbits/sec,
which is not likely.  So I would assume that each HP had it's own source
of data.

        I suspect the answer to this one is intuitively obvious, but my
intuition has been incorrect before...  I have checked the FAQ, and am
now combing through Bruce Scheier's book looking for an answer...
        There's been a lot of talk here about sucessful attacks on such
ciphers as DES, RSA, and the like.  I am _not_ implying or commenting on
the claimed success of attacks on either of these, but...
    For instance, when one talks about a "brute force" attack on DES,
how do you know when the key you have attempted is The Right One?
I am imagining a previously mentioned Mondo Computer System, churning
away at some cyphertext, performing some clever attack or another.
Suppose the original plaintext was compressed.  Suppose that the
compressed plaintext was then encrypted, and the attacker suspects
that it was DES, or RSA, or some fairly common algorithm which she can
successfully attack.   Is there any way to know from the ciphertext (or
from the results of an attack) just _how_many_ times it was encrypted?
        How will she know she has the right compressed file, since the
plaintext will not just pop right out?  Will she have to try a bunch
of decompression algorithms and wait for plaintext to pop out?
        In a somewhat similar line:
 
    Given:
    m = the original plaintext
    k1 = first encipherment key
    k2 = second encipherment key
            and
    DES(k,x) represents one 'iteration' of DES enciphering on text x,
            using the key k.
    ~DES(k,x) represents one 'iteration' of inverse DES (deciphering) on x,
            using the key k.
 [I believe this pair of operations is called the ECB encryption mode.]
 
    Does there exist a key k3 such that m = ~DES(k3,r) where
        r = DES(k2,q) and q = DES(k1,m) ??
 
        I thought I heard that the answer is 'no', because DES is not a
group in the mathematical sense.  If RSA has its roots in the products
of very large primes, I don't think this will work for RSA and ~RSA,
because RSA would probably not be a group, either.
        Replies can be made here, or via email if this clutters up the
forum.  Thanks in advance.    -Mark

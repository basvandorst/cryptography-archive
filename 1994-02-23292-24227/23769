mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu (Mark Riordan) once said:

MR> Announcing the release of RIPEM version 1.2.
MR> 
MR> RIPEM is a free email-oriented public key encryption program.
MR> 
MR> RIPEM 1.2 contains extensive modifications by Jeff Thompson of RSA
MR> Data Security to provide a measure of true Internet PEM interoperability,
MR> and to implement a "direct-trust" model for public keys.  This new
MR> certificate-based trust model is more secure than RIPEM 1.1's but
MR> less hierarchical than Internet PEM's.
MR> 
MR> RIPEM 1.2 can read all RIPEM 1.1-formatted messages, and can also
MR> read genuine MIC-ONLY and MIC-CLEAR Internet PEM messages.  RIPEM
MR> 1.2 cannot read or produce encrypted Internet PEM messages.  RIPEM
MR> 1.2's outputed messages can be read by RIPEM 1.1.

    [ stuff deleted ]

Is it also compatible with PGP ?

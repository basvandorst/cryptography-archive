The kaserver is much the same.  Although the code is entirely
different, the ticket formats are identical to Kerberos V4 tickets,
and can be used by Kerberos clients.  The replicated database servers
encrypt the kerberos database when transferring it between themselves,
but ordinary data can't be encrypted.  The gummint lets software
vendors export uncrippled Kerberos in binary form if they can obscure
the entry points.  MIT could surely get a license to export uncrippled
Kerberos in binary form, they probably just lack any reason to go to
the trouble.

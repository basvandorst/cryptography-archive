Perhaps, but if I wanted to eavesdrop on you, and you were using some
kind of SS or encrypted cordless phone, I'd just go to the phone
junction box and tap into the wires.  By encrypting or hiding the
wireless part of the conversation, you have merely changed the
location of the "weakest link" to be the wired part.

Of course, I understand that by doing so, I would be changing the
nature of my act (that is, from using a scanner to wiretapping), but
my comments above are addressed at hypothetical technical issues
(which are constant the world over) and not legal ones (which vary
from state to state).

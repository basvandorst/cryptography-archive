When I destroy a large disk, I like to disassemble the 
individual disk platters from the spindle.  I then fold the
platters in half, so that the disks will rock back and forth.
I then stick a piece of paper that looks like a horse head on one end  of
the platter.  I start rocking all six platters....

I then sandblast the disks...


I know my data is dead when all there is left is a bunch of brown dust and
six dead horses.

No, there's certainly no standard.  One problem is that if you want to have
N bits of real message and N bits of fake message, you need 2N bits 
of total message, assuming there's no correlation between the messages.
That sort of thing tends to be noticeable, but it's mostly awkward.

On the other hand, if you're using steganography, doing something like
hiding the message in the bottom red bit of a 24-bit image,
you could hide the fake message in the bottom green message,
and the other fake "Darn, they knew there were really two messages"
message in the bottom blue bit.  With 8-bit images, or 8-bit sound
samples, hiding 2 bits could get pretty ugly.

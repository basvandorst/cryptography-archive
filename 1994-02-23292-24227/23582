	Citibank, while not criminal, is surely not stupid enough to
use Clipper. Last time I talked to the local Cylink sales rep, he
said NSA was pitching Clipper to banks and financials as a Real Good
Thing and that he was coming in along behind them and selling triple
DES like it was going out of style. It doesn't take a nuclear physicist
to figure out that a system that may be less strong algorithmically
than Skipjack is still much "stronger" overall if it doesn't have the
amazing disadvantage of having bits of keys lying around all over the
place.

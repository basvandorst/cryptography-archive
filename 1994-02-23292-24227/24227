Here what I got back from one.  I sent off my  key 
and it showed up in the FTPable file  shortly after.
There was something in the doc directory of the 
PGP release about  servers (much like the following).
A bit over 4,000 people currently listed.  Cool.  You
may also want to know about alt.security.pgp.

PGP Public Keyservers
---------------------

There are PGP public key servers which allow one to exchange public
keys running through the Internet and UUCP mail systems.

NOTE!

This service is NOT supported in any way whatsoever by the schools or
organizations on which these servers run.  It is here only to help
transfer keys between PGP users.  It does NOT attempt to guarantee
that a key is a valid key; use the signators on a key for that kind of
security.  This service can be discontinued at any time without prior
notification.

Each keyserver processes requests in the form of mail messages.  The
commands for the server are entered on the Subject: line.

        Subject: help

Sending your key to ONE server is enough.  After it processes your
key, it will forward your add request to other servers automagically.

For example, to add your key to the keyserver, or to update your key if it is
already there, send a message similar to the following to any server:

        To: pgp-public-keys@pgp.iastate.edu
        From: johndoe@some.site.edu
        Subject: add

        -----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
        Version: 2.2

        <blah blah blah>
        -----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----

COMPROMISED KEYS:  Create a Key Revocation Certificate (read the PGP
docs on how to do that) and mail your key to the server once again,
with the ADD command.

Valid commands are:

Command                Message body contains
---------------------- -------------------------------------------------
ADD                    Your PGP public key (key to add is body of msg)
INDEX                  List all PGP keys the server knows about (-kv)
VERBOSE INDEX          List all PGP keys, verbose format (-kvv)
GET                    Get the whole public key ring
GET userid             Get just that one key
MGET regexp            Get all keys which match /regexp/
LAST days              Get the keys updated in the last `days' days
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Examples for the MGET command:

        MGET michael         Gets all keys which have "michael" in them
        MGET iastate         All keys which contain "iastate"
        MGET F605A5|3A738B   Those two keyid's

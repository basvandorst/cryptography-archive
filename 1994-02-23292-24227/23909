I refuse to regard that idea paranoid.  I think it is crazy to think of a 
goverment that would even consider trying to forbid private persons to 
encrypt their communications, or even worse : forbid people to talk unless 
an agent of the government could listen in.  As a citizen of another 
sovereign state (Norway) I think the idea is strange, but I am willing to 
tolerate what other people are doeing in their own place.  But do not export 
the idea.  I think it violates basic human rights.

BUT !!! And even consider the thought that agents of one country should 
be permitted to snoop into the communications of citizens of another country 
is weird !!!!

If the random bitstream is truly random (whatever that means), then a 
one time pad cannot be broken by cryptanalysis.  After all, your 
ciphertext could be Hamlet, depending on what particular stream of random 
bits the cryptanalyst assumes.  In practice, OTP may be less secure 
because the key is too long to be memorized; it must be written down 
somewhere.

Anyway, I am looking for sofware of that sort myself.  I have drawn
up a circuit to generate random numbers from the noise in a diode and
feed those numbers into a serial port (haven't built it yet, though
I've collected all the parts but one).

BTW, how is the graduate program at Carnegie-Mellon?  I looked into 
finishing my master's degree (in EE) there about a year ago but those 
plans have languished since then.  Send e-mail.

That bad, huh?

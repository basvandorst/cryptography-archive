Spread spectrum is much easier than you think to detect.  If you have
two antennas separated by sufficient distance that the random moise is
largely uncorrelated, then when you do a cross correlation of the
antenna "noise" the signal sticks out like a sore thumb, even if it is
below the noise threshold.  This also gives a line (plane) in which
the source is located (from the relative delay).  A third antenna and
cross correlator will locate the site.

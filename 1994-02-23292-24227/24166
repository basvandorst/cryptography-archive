Not a surprise.

This is misleading.

Addition mod 2^16 is linear.  
Exclusive or is linear.
Multiplication in the multiplicative group mod 2^16+1 is well
approximated by multiplication in the field mod 2^16+1.

Thus all the operations are linear or have good linear approximations.

Linear methods will NOT solve the resulting system because the 
operations are linear over different fields.

Find the best linear approximation you can for that four-operation
transformation.  You see my point ?

That doesn't show IDEA is strong, but criticizing it for linearity
is nonsense.

I think your intuition is baseless.

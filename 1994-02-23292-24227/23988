I have a question regarding this Clipper chip deal.  

As I understand it, DES has a 56bit key and Clipper is supposed to have
an 80bit key composed of two 40bit keys put together.  Would I be wrong
in assuming that if you can derive one half of the Clipper key, you can
find the other half?  (you can with RSA right?)  
My conventional wisdom tells me that if that's the case, Clipper would
then be weaker than DES based upon key size.  (2**56 DES keys and only
2**40 keys to find full Clipper key)  

Is this true?  If it is, has it been argued to the government that this
is unacceptable?  

I can understand the key escrows and what they are supposed to do, but
as it is, DES isn't all that hard to crack on a relative scale and
Clipper would then be even easier.  The escrows would be worthless if
anybody with a little money and some time can crack it.

Please tell me I am wrong in this line of thinking,

thanks,

Actually, not. The authorities have to prove that you were using a television 
receiver and not any other form of visual display unit. For example, no 
licence would be required for a TV  which had been crippled by the removal of
its tuning circuits, so that it was incapable of acting as a receiver.

The technology used by the detectors needs to ensure that the target 
equipment is indeed acting as a receiver of TV signals.

Can anyone think of a good reason why credit card numbers, or
for that matter, ANY account numbers (mortgage loans, car loans,
etc.) should appear on a credit report (except one being sent to the 
subject of the credit report)?  I can't think of any.  Does a 
potential creditor really care about my VISA card number?  The 
report can, and probably already does, include info on the bank, 
the card type (MC/VISA/AMEX/whatever), credit limit, current balance, 
payment history, account status, etc.  That's what a creditor needs.  
(Gold vs. green and other marketing silliness ends up being reflected
in the credit limit.) Although it is possible for someone to have 
two VISA cards at the same bank, I doubt very much that the creditor 
needs to know which one, by account number, is 60 days late in payment.  
He just needs to know that there are two cards each with a $10,000 
limit and charged almost to the max.  The creditor can't charge
my credit cards if I fail to pay him - that's illegal unless I
agreed to it.

The account numbers probably still have to be reported TO the credit
reporting agency.  They would be needed in letting the subject
of the report straighten out errors of the one-account-reported-as-several
(I picked up one of these when the card was turned over to another
bank and the account number changed.) and several-accounts-merged-into-one 
type, especially if some of these belong to different people.  Does 
anyone have any suggestions on how to eliminate reporting of account 
numbers TO credit reporting agencies without hindering the usefulness 
of the reports to honest creditors and the ability to correct errors?
You could send an md5 hash of the account number instead of the
account number, but I'm not sure that would help much.  It would
confuse straightening out errors.

I don't think credit reports with account numbers should be allowed
to be transmitted to people who don't already have the account numbers,
period.  Encrypted or not.  Nobody needs them.

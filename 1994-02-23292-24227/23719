Mr. Markoff's thoughtful article raises many interesting points
that are worthy of serious NET discussion. To start the process I
have listed some of the more obvious items in the bullet list
that follows.

1. Do we need a new newsgroup to discuss this topic to conserve
existing group bandwidth: and, what should we name it?
alt.security.stu4?

2. Given prior equipment has been commissioned as a result of
needs by various governmental entities, would it be helpful if
the systems design parameters of the "STU-4" are publically
discussed and openly available to avoid potential user paranoia?

3. Given that the PGP algorithm has been the topic of litigation
both from a patent and ITAR perspective, will the "STU-4" use a
different, sufficiently robust algorithm and be developed world
wide so as to minimize potential litigation and maximize
potential use?

4. Should the "STU-4" include space for CLipper capability?

5. Should the "STU-4" have TEMPEST, ISDN, cellular and other
capabilities deemed user useful?

Additional items of a serious nature that would further this
discussion thread are invited.

Note that an SB-pro would only provide half-duplex due to the "cheap"
design of the DMA and digitizing hardware.  I don't know if the SBP-16
is any better, but I'd conjecture that it probably isn't.

Encryption comes AFTER compression, not before.  So this should not be a
problem.  Note that compressed audio isn't going to be helped at all by
MNP5 or v.42 compression anyhow.

  My primary concern is how the Federal Government proposes to keep these
things (escrowed keys) out of the hands of unauthorized personel...No offense
intended to the folks who read this and work for the Federal Government.  My
concern is not with the government listening in on my traffic (I make a sincere
effort to remain law abiding) but with other private individuals taking an
interest in my communications.
  How do the FBI and the NSA propose to provide at least minimal security
against unauthorized use of escrow keys?  Not only physical security (taken for
granted...I hope it can be) but data security, as well (i.e. how do they
propose to prevent someone from gaining electronic access to these keys and
selling them to anyone).
  Just wondering....

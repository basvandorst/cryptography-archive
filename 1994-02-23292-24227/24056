As I understand the spirit of the law in the U.S., the airwaves are
public, anyone can listen to anything they want. The only restrictions are
on transmissions on those frequencies assigned/regulated by the FCC.

Hence radar detectors and cellphone taps should be legal.

However, certain special interests have been able to bend the rules somewhat.

Since cellphone people have louder lawyers than cordless phone people, I believe
it is now required to have a warrant in order to tap a cell phone. Not so for a
cordless. You tell me the difference ;-)

Similarly, radar detectors are illegal in certain states, even though in theory
you are allowed to listen to whatever frequency you fell like.

I believe that in the U.S. military doesn't mind if you listen in on their
frequencies. The important stuff is encrypted (hopefully), so they don't care!

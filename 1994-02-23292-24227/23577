   I chose my words very carefully -- I said that "if you make the assumption 
that they honestly believe that they're the 'good guys'". Nowhere did I say 
or imply anything about the truth or falsity of their beliefs, or whether or 
not they actually hold such beliefs. I merely offered it as a possible 
explanation of the motivations behind their actions. If you wish someone to 
modify their actions, you would be wise to understand what they percieve to 
be their motives. (Note again the careful choice of words -- I'm not saying 
that these are their motives, merely what that may percieve to be their 
motives.)

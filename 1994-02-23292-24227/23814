Regarding the question posed here may I point out the observations made
back in 1975 by the authors of the CF factoring method(Morrison and Brillhart)
that, indeed, factoring a composite that is a product of only two primes
was much harder than if it was otherwise. No proof, of course, just an obser-
vation. Insofar as the factoring of RSA-like moduli is concerned there are
quite a few methods of ferreting out the primes, the complexity theory not-
withstanding...

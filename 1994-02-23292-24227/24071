   My point was that P=NP is a problem where if it is independent of a
particular system, you can't prove that it independent (within that
system).*  So while it may be possible to prove P=NP is not
independent, any time spent trying to prove it is independent is
wasted.

   *There are restricted systems where P=NP is true, and others where
it is false.  Of course the interesting domain is the one we can't
step outside of.

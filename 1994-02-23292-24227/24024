Tempest for T.V?  In Ireland, you need a "Television License" to
operate a T.V.  They (the police) have a van with some type of
device which can detect whether or not a T.V. is operating at
a specific place of residence.  I doubt if the device can 
actually find out what you are watching, but, that would be
kind of useless;  The area of Ireland I was staying in had
two television stations.

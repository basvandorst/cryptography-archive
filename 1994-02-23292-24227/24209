PES came first. Then came IPES, which was later renamed IDEA, and
has been shown to be invulnerable to differential cryptanalysis.

I'd rather say it's comparable to realizing that DES with a 56-bit
key has a strength of only 47 bits. Both are due to differential
cryptanalysis. The problem with double-DES is of a totally different
nature.

At one level, double-DES can be seen as a 32-round DES with a weak
key-schedule, composed of two ordinary key schedules. The weakness
comes from the fact that it is split into two halves, which
facilitates a meet-in-the-middle attack. If we remove this two-block
scedule and design a new 32-round schedule according to the same
principles as the 16-round, we should be able to get a lot more
security out of each round.

How about changing only the key schedule, and leaving the
rounds intact?

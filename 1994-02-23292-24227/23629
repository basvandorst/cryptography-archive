Here is a portion of the recent NIST announcement:

   The Data Encryption Algorithm has completed the third review in its
   16-year history and been reaffiremed for five years. Comments from
   interested parties were evaluated and used to make revisions in the
   DES that will be specified by FIPS 46-2, effective June 30 1994. The
   primary modification of the standard allows the implementation of the
   DEA to include software, firmware, hardware or any combination thereof.
   During the five-year affirmation period, NIST will consider security
   alternatives to the DEA as it will be over 20 years old when next
   reviewed in 1998.

And you thought DES was dead!

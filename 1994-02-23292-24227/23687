Vinge called Usenet's successor "The Net of a Million Lies"... nothing
wrong with gathering a little inconsistency, as long as you do the sorting
and filtering yourself afterwards.  A foolish consistency is the etc...

   Do I contradict myself?  Very well then I contradict myself,
   (I am large, I contain multitudes.)

As long as you're accumulating inconsistent responses, I'll remind you of
the paper by Michael Wiener presented at the rump session of Crypto '93,
wherein he lays out a careful and detailed design for a $1,000,000 machine
to crack DES plain/cipher pairs at the average rate of one every 3.5
hours, using today's hardware and fabrication methods.  It's dead, Jim...
use triple DES if your data are worth more than a 3.5-hour block on
somebody's million dollar computer.

I omitted it deliberately, as it is virtually useless for anything
over 18 digits. For example, consider a 50 digit N which is the product
of 2 25-digit primes that are identical in the first 4 digits. By any
reasonable definition, these are nearly equal, yet Fermat's method
is hopeless for factoring N.  Fermat's method runs in time proportional
to the DIFFERENCE between the 2 factors. Here, the difference is still a
21-digit number.

"roughly equal" still leads to too many operations.

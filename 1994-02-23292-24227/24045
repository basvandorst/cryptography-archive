Let me correct this. Many people seem to be laboring under this delusion.
Fermat's method will factor N = pq  (p,q, need not be prime) in time
O(p-q).  If (say) N is 50 digits, p, and q are prime and p ~ 1.0001q
[i.e. p and q are nearly equal] you will still need approx. 10^21 
operations to factor N via Fermat's method. This is WAY out of compute
range. Only if p and q are VERY VERY VERY close (i.e. differ only in the
last 8 or 9 digits) will Fermat's method succeed.

Fermat's method is marginally usefull for N up to about 18 digits
once you have pulled out the small primes by trial division.

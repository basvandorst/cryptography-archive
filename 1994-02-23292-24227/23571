   I was wondering if anyone has made any guesses as to how the SKIPJACK
algorithm (as I understand the algorithm that is to be used to implement the
Clipper standard) works.
   I understand that the government has not made the algorithm public, so I
realise that you guys are kind of flying blind, but what would you guys
predict?

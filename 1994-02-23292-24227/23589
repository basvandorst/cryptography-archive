  Your evidence for this assertion?

  Even this much of a difference leaves open the most plausible explanation
for why the government touts Skipjack as secure for the rest of us but
chooses not to use it for its own secrets (that being the theory that the
Skipjack algorithm has a built-in trapdoor).

  Irrelevant.  Even a difference within one "classs of algorithm" between the
system the government _really_ trusts and Skipjack carries the clear
that the government experts who designed the latter don't think it's all
it's cracked up to be.

  The fact that they are willing to compromise something they don't consider
very important anyway (privacy) in order to achieve a goal (forestalling
the establishment of _real_ strong crypto standards) merely proves that
they have a sense of tactics.  It proves nothing about the merits of
Skipjack.

  This is not a meaningful comparison.  The government properly makes decisions
about what security measures to use for its secrets; private citizens properly
make decisions about what security measures to use for their own secrets.
There is no reason why the two should be weighed against each other on some
abstract priority scale, since one does not in any way interfere with the
other.

  There is a Brute-Force Password Cracker written in  C out there...
I think I cut mine out of a file called UNIXDOCS.ZIP,  But it looked
more like a Phreak Magazine than anything... But it did include that
C Source.  It may not be excatly what you are looking for, but it may give you
some hints/clues...
 
Goodluck!

So much cost for so little benefit... Like they said "~it's your

This is frightening.  Very frightening.  Basic civil liberties despensed
with by a handful of centralized clerks 'just following orders'.

I assume this to mean the NSA intends to routinely get the keys for
*ANY* international call...  Of course, given the laxness of the proposed
key escrow agency, this doesn't diminish the security of communications
for American citizens by much :(

Or maybe it means they will get ALL keys as the chips are made. 

Scary, very scary.

Let's hope they are not sucessful.

In summary, the government is spending megamillions to make sure they can
continue to monitor the communications of US citizens even though they
realize it will have no benefit except to catch a few stupid crooks.

Was the Ministry of Truth represented at this meeting?  ;)

Yes, it's been done before; it's called "steganography".
There's a program out there called "stego" that does it, 
I think for Macs, but other good implementations are always welcome.

Hiding data in the least significant bit of pictures or sound files
are the standard techniques people talk about on the net.
One concern is that the hidden data really *does* need to look random;
if your bottom-bits end up all in 7-bit ascii saying
	"BEGIN SECRET MESSAGE...."
and they *do* decide to look at your file, it's pretty blatant....

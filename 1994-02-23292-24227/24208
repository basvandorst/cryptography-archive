	        The thing is, after encryption the speech data are going to
	        be incompressible, so for full duplex conversation you are
	        going to have pretty limited bandwidth unless you both have
	        ISDN.

I remember you - you're the guy who talks shite on the uk groups
too, aren't you?  Engage your brain for 2 seconds before speaking
please.  Clearly you compress *first*, then encrypt.

Sheesh, as our American cousins would say.

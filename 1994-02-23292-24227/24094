Well, I have read references in the literature about some other techniques,
such as the ElGamal Algorithm, which uses the discrete logarithm problem 
instead of the factoring problem.


The discrete logarithm problem (Finding x, such that a^x=b mod r) is another
computationally hard problem (has anyone established a lower bound?)


However, if many of the discrete math problems (factoring, logarithm) are
interrelated.  If you can the discrete log problem, for example, you can
crack RSA... (I think).

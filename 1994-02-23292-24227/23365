It depends on what you want the physical random numbers for.  If you
want something good enough for Monte Carlo, it is impossible to test
for it, because to test, say, that the bits are accurate to .001,
a sample of about 10^7 will be needed, and for any complicated 
Monte Carlo, this is nowhere near good enough.  Mere testing is
not good enough.

For cryptographic purposes, lack of equiprobability should not be
a major concern, but lack of independence is likely to be very bad.
This is the harder item to test for, but a good nuclear RNG is 
likely to be good here.  This is a place where thermal noise can
be very deceptive, and this dependence can be considerable.

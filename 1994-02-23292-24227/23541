    You forgot the "rest of the story", which is even more sobering.
Stimson was Secretary of War, and directly responsible for and one of
the recipients of, the PURPLE decryptions.  He was also involved in
the deal to trade PURPLE, et al to the British for MAGIC data.  (One
of the best indications of Hitler's intentions were the messages home
from the Japanese Ambassador in Berlin...)  So he not only did in
private what he had deplored in public, he supported the efforts
before there were tangible results, and he targeted efforts against
the diplomats of the country most wounded by the AMerican Black
Chamber.  One of the best examples of "where you sit is where you
stand" in Washington bureaucracy.

    It is not all black and white, some means are justified only for
some ends.  But in my book too, many tactics legitimate for use
against declared enemies in wartime, are not justifed against
citizens, even in wartime.  So let's not put the temptation out there.
I'd rather the politicians don't have a chance to be fallible.

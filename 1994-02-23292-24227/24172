Probably nowhere.

However, the president of RSA DSI, Jim Bidzos,  has given me the 
source code to their implementation of DESX and the following statement:

"We claim no intellectual property ownership of DESX except for a
copyright on our own implementation and a trademark on DESX.  If
someone wanted to use our spec for DESX, they could call it DESX if it
were an accurate implementation. In any case, no money is involved."

[However, there is no actual specification document.]

:  What is the patent number?  Without a patent, there is no need to
:  ask permission.

So, no patent--just the copyright.
I will prepare a description of the algorithm and have
someone who has not seen RSA DSI's code reimplement it 
in C.  (RSA's implementation is about 150 lines of C,
so it shouldn't be too hard.)  Then we'll have a public
domain implementation of a stronger-than-DES cipher
designed by recognized experts.

I remember posting about this before, but anyway let
me repeat myself:

the number of messages which are `unconcealed', i.e.,

RSAEncrypt(M,e,n)=M , in other words, M^e = M mod n,

is equal to: [ 1 + gcd(e-1,p-1)] [ 1 + gcd(e-1,q-1) ]
where n=pq. See the paper by Blakley & Boroh mentioned
in the previous posting.

This is number is at least 9 since p, q, and e are odd,
thus we have gcd(e-1,p-1)=gcd(even,even)>=2, giving
[1 + 2] [ 1 + 2] =9.

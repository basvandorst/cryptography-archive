Now that we have secure drive that protected whole drives with IDEA, in
my opinion we need a program that protect tape backups with Idea.
 
What kind of protection is now out there for tape backups?
 
Right now I am ziping my secure drive and then pgp -c the zip file, but
that is very very time consuming and round about way of doing it!!!!

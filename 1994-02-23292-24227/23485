I'm desperately looking for an algorithm suitable to crypt character-based (!)
data transmission, so no blocks, no
checksums on these blocks.

I know garbling is a real life problem, but a bit of line noise (on an
unencrypted line)
is not a problem. The problem is that most algorithms
loose track entirely after just a bit of garbage, making the rest of the data
sent totally useless, as it isn't being
decrypted into it's original plaintext anymore.

Is there an algorithm that doesn't have this problem,
or a "trick" in combination with an
algorithm to avoid this problem?
The need for synchronisation between the two computers would be sure to kill
the entire project.

                Z.

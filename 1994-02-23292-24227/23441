see "how to explain zero-knowledge protocols to your children,"
by quisquater, guillou, and berson, crypto '89 proceedings, springer.
this article is summarized in schneier's book, but i like quisquater's
version better. quisquater's and guillou's kids are included in the
list of authors.				-don davis

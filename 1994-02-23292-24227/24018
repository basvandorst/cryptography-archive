Heh, heh.  That brings up an amusing thought.  Any chance that all of the
sub-keys held by one of the agencies will be identical?  I.e., store the
unit key at one agency and give the other agency the key '00...00".  And
of course, who would know.  I assume that measures would be in place to
prevent someone just dumping key-halves out to the screen.  I can see it
know: 

"Ecuse me Mr. Smith, but I was wondering about this entry in the logs
while you were on duty last night?"

# cat citizen-keys | lpr

"Oh, I was just checking to make sure they weren't all the same."

Just a thought. ;-)

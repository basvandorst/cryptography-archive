Huh? Factoring primes is easy; that is why they are called 'primes'!!!!

This is not correct. See my other post.

The NUMBER of factors is irrelevent. It is the SIZE of the factors
that is important. For example, suppose N  = 3p, where p is a prime
of several thousand bits. N is the product of 2 primes, but it is
EASY to factor.

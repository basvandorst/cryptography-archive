They answer, "We received an anonymous tip that B was a drug dealer."
Or they pull B over for a broken taillight and "discover" the drugs.
Or someone (i.e. the officer) calls 911 and reports an emergency at B's
    house.  When the police break in they happen to see the drugs.
Or they just "happen" to be in the neighborhood and see B receive the drugs.
Or they threaten B with a 10 year sentence if he doesn't plead guilty to
    misdemeanor charges, so the case never goes to trial.
Or they tell B they'll let him off if he rats on C, so C goes to jail
    without the wiretap ever coming up.
Or they seize B's money as a civil forfeiture so there's no trial.

There are a lot of alternatives to saying in court, "Well, we arrested B on
the basis of an illegal wiretap."

This doesn't seem to have much to do with crypto. So: has anyone looked
closely at REDOC III?  It looks like differential cryptanalysis would break
it rather easily. (I know Biham and Shamir attacked REDOC II this way.)

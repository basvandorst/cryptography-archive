_By Way of Deception_, Victor Ostrovsky and Claire Hoy,
St. Martins Press, NY, 1990, ISBN 0-312-05613-3

In this Ostrovsky reports Mossad's computer services routinely monitor VISA,
AMEX, and Diner's Club transactions as well as police computer transactions. 
(Appendix I)  If they have taken the trouble to tap these folk's leased lines,
why would they not monitor the much more public Internet?

Since the NSA routinely monitors all international communications, including
phone calls, why would they not monitor the much easier to monitor Internet?

It's horrifying to realize that somewhere in the bowels of the NSA,
there are people who are very likely right now working on saving the
world in the year 2004.

Have you read comic books about various super-heros?  Every now and
then, somebody decides that the only way to protect the world is to
acquire unlimited powers through some fantastic invention and *force*
the people to be good.  The villain is always some brilliant madman
working in isolation in a lonely place, content to be unknown until
he's ready to take over the universe.  He is full of rationalizations,
and he is always convinced that the world *needs* him, even though it
doesn't realize it (just yet).  When his day comes, people in every
nation will rise to worship him and thank him for saving them from
themselves.

Fortunately some super-hero like Superman or Batman always comes along
and figures out that this is not a good thing.

Ok, so now we have our billiant madmen in real life, working in hiding
to impose their vision on the world.  All we need now is the
super-heros.  I hope they come soon.

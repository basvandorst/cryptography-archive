in case it wasn't clear, my ITAR survey is a personal project, and not
a project of the FSF or gnu.

my initial proposal for the survey generated an overwhelmingly
positive response, so i've decided to go ahead with the project.

i'm taking off for florida tomorrow and won't be in netland for a
week, but after that i'll get around to acknowledging receipt of
surveys and the like.

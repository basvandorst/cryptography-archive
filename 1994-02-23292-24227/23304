I was at a gathering this past weekend and a friend of mine swore up and
down that Phill Zimmerman sold out to the feds and put in a back door to
versions of PGP that are currently out on the net.  She cited an article in
_Wired_ as the source of this rumor.

My copy of _Wired_ with this supposed article has grown legs and walked
off.  Could some kind soul please tell me that this is a joke?

In the event that it isn't a joke, please tell me which versions have not
been compromised.

I realize that just about any post about PGP to sci.crypt is incendiary in
nature; I apologize for any ensuing flame-fest.

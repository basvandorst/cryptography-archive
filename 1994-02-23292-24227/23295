Sorry, for the brief and angry reply, but it fully expresses my feeling
for the two Intrepid books. To refute the two texts in detail, even just
point out the errors would mean writing a text on the size of the
"Intrepid" book itself.

But you should be able to see many of the error yourself even if you
are not a historian.

If you look at the phrase "COLOSSUS, a photoelectric punched tape
that would eventually encode or decipher thousands of groups a second"
you clearly see what I mean. We all know that COLOSSUS was a special
purpose computer and not a "a photoelectric punched tape". It is true
that COLOSSUS had a photoelectric punched tape reader as it input
device, but even a writer like William Stephenson should be able to
distinguish between a punched tape and an electronic computer.

Further the dons and scientists never called themselves 'boffins',
it was rather the politicians and people in the Armed Forces that
used this expression.

This is just one example, the two books are full of similar and
worse errors and falsehoods. I have yet to find a historian that have
anything good to say about the two books. I will look up my reference
data base and let you have the reference to a few of the reviews of
the "Intrepid" books. None of the reviewers have a kind word to say.

Now there is some speculation that William Stephenson was fooled by
Stevenson himself. It has recently come to light that Stevenson was
a master of greatly magnifying his own image and it is quite likely
that he carefully choose William Stephenson as the right man to get
his place in history. But this does not absolve William Stephenson
for his sloppy handling of the historical facts.

It was mentioned in another article that the Lorenz machine produced
a punched tape output. This is not correct. The Lorenz machines were
stand alone teleprinter cipher machines that would be connected to a
normal teleprinter. The teleprinter itself could be equipped with
both a tape reader and a tape punch, but the Lorenz cipher machine
itself had no such attachments.

The reason for the punched tape on the input of the first Colossus
models was that the tape had to run in a loop to step through all
combinations of key and cipher message. The actual cipher messages
were first recorded on ondulator tape, like you record morse code
messages on tape, and then translated from the ondulator tape on
to punched teleprinter tape. It is possible that the punched tape
was generated in parallel with the ondulator tape, but that the
punched tape then would we corrected with information from the
ondulator tape when the interception was poor and errors occured.

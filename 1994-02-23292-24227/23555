This may be the wrong mailing list, but how secure is spread spectrum
communications?  I believe that this is the scheme that randomly
switches channels every few milliseconds according to a pseudorandom
sequence that both parties agree on beforehand.

The question really has two parts:

1.  Can the communication even be seen above the noise?

2.  Can the channel changes be followed?

I noticed that Passport, (ex-Cincinnati Microwave) is now selling
900 MHz "spread spectrum" cordless telephones (not cellular, but the
home cordless phones).  They claim that the neighbors (including hams)
can't listen in.  What about others?

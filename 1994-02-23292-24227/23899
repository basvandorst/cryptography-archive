What conjecture is this? I am not aware of any such 'conjecture'.
It is trivially true that methods which find small factors first
will have a harder time factoring numbers that have only large
(i.e. near sqrt(N)) prime factors. Methods that depend only on the
size of N do not care.

Further:


Your question is not well defined. What do you mean by the "general"
factoring problem?  The (current) best general algorithms known
(PPMPQS; NFS) do not depend on the size of the factors or how many factors
exist. They depend ONLY on the size of the number being factored.

Other methods, (ECM, P+/-1, Pollard Rho, trial division etc.) find
only small factors. But they find them quickly. The general approach
used today is to use these methods to find small factors, then to use
PPMPQS or NFS.

:Is it "just" the current state-of-the-art that suggests those
:numbers are at least as difficult to factor than random 
:integers of the same length?
 
Either a method depends on the size of the factors or it does not.
If it does, then that method will find it harder to factor N = pq,
(p ~ q ~ sqrt(N)) than an N which has small factors. If the method
only depends on the size of N, then the size of the factors is
irrelevent. This is a trivial observation that is independent of the
state-of-the-art.

   Leaving aside algorithms that make factoring faster independently of key
   size (we'd really be in hot water there), it's starting to look as if we'd
   have to abandon factorable cryptography, i.e. RSA etc. at about the time
   their patents expire or we'll start having keys which are often
   longer than the messages they're supposed to protect.

So far we have only dealt with the fact that it can be done.  That still
leaves open the questions of how much it will cost and how long it will
take.  Cryptographic attacks are only efficient if you can recover the
clear text for less than its value to you and within the data's useful
life.

As to keys longer than the data that we are trying to protect, that is
already true for RSA.  No one is using RSA to protect anything longer
than 128 bit IDEA key.  (Cryptographers always focus on the strength of
the primitive mechanism, but it is only the strength of the system that
counts.

It should also be noted that the work factor for the cryptographer rises
only linearly while that for the cryptanalyst rises exponentially.  A
2048 modulus will be trivial to the user in a decade, while, barring
major inventions in number theory, still formidable and clearly not
efficient, not to say "computationally infeasible," to the cryptanalyst
a century or a millenium from now.

In the world of cheap computing, the advantage always goes to the
cryptographer, never the cryptanalyst.

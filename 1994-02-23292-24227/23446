Bruce,

I have a textbook coming out in late spring/early summer from Macmillan, 
entitled "Network and Internetwork Security", which will cover the following:

Chapter 1: Overview
PART I INTERNETWORK SECURITY PRINCIPLES
Chapter 2: Conventional Encryption
Chapter 3: Confidentiality Using Conventional Encryption
Chapter 4: Public-Key Cryptography
Chapter 5: Authentication and Digital Signatures
Chapter 6: Intruders, Viruses, and Worms
PART II INTERNETWORK SECURITY PRACTICE
Chapter 7: Cryptographic Algorithms
Chapter 8: Authentication and Key Exchange
Chapter 9: Electronic Mail Privacy
Chapter 10: Network Management Security

The book covers topics recommended in ACM and IEEE curricula guidelines 
and includes homework problems, guides to further reading, glossary, etc.

Two integers are relatively prime if they have no common divisor (common
factor) other than 1.

The equal sign in the above should be the "congruence" symbol.  The above
equation should read "ed is congruent to 1 modulo (p-1)(q-1)", that is,
ed leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by (p-1)(q-1).  In math books,
this is usually written as "ed [congruence symbol] 1 (mod (p-1)(q-1))".

It's true that 1 divides any integer evenly, but this translates to
"x mod 1 = 0, for any integer x", not the one you have.

* The symbol "mod" is used in more than one way.  In math books, it is usually
  used in congruences like "x [congruence symbol] y (mod m)".  In computer
  science books, it is often used as an integer operator. e.g. "x mod y"
  is means "the remainder of x divided by y".  This sometimes causes 
  confuses the beginners.

>Apparently, this multiplicative inverse stuff is beyond me.

Suppose x is an integer, the "multiplicative inverse of x modulo m" is an
integer y such that

	xy [congruent] 1 (mod m)	(in the mathematician's notation)

or equivalently,

	xy mod m = 1 			(in the computer scientist's notation)
.

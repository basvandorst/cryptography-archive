A customer of ours has a requirement to provide electronic authentication of
documents, preferably using a hardware token such as a smart card (the
documents are in electronic format).  There is also a requirement for a
secure login system along the lines of the Racal Guardata system.

I'd be interested in people's experiences with similar systems, and would
welcome mail from any potential suppliers (although there's no immediate
sale prospect, I have to be honest!).

Many thanks in advance,

Nik

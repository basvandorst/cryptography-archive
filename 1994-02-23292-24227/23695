If you were in the United States I might tell you to log
on to nic.funet.fi and fetch the Outerbridge/Karn/Gillogly
DES code that is quite fast for software and can optionally
do multi-block, CBC, double or triple key, and so on.

But since your suffix is .gr I think the ITAR means we
cannot provide technical assistance to you.

Bill Payne claimed to have an efficient way of calculating phi(n), which if
true, allows one to calculate the private key of the RSA algorithm.

It turns out that his algorithm is O(phi(n)), and since phi(n) is almost as
big as n, and n in the RSA setting is at least hundreds of digits, the
algorithm would take a long, long time. (i.e. Consider how long it would
take for the fastest computer you can think of to count to 10^200.)

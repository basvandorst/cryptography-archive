I wish the publisher would be willing to correct the errors in the next
printing.  The problem is that Wiley considers it to be an expense that
won't help sales, so they are not interested.  

I hope to do a second edition in a couple of years; I will correct the
errors there.  (And this time, I will demand to choose my own copyeditor,
proofreader, and indexer.)

If the government is to use encryption internally for administrative  
communications and recordkeeping, it is better to have escrowed keys than  
totally secret keys.  People within government can cause much more damage  
through rogue secrecy (look at the insane dreck that Oliver North stamped Top  
Secret, released in the book of Iran-Contra papers published by National  
Security Archive) than can most people outside of government.  Key escrow used  
inside of government provides at least the possibility of independent audit and  
review (and FOIA disclosure) of communications and records.

I agree: Clipper within government is a neutral-to-good thing, with some  
exceptions (police radios need, with few exceptions, to be in the clear to  
allow immediate citizen oversight).  Allowing its use outside of government is  
a neutral-to-good thing.  Mandating its use outside government is a Bad thing.

I am willing to assume that people working for the NSA honestly believe they
are the "good guys". I am also willing to believe that some either believe
"the ends justify the means". The problem as I see it is the ends simply do
not justify the means. Until it is firmly ingrained into NSAs culture that
desireable ends can NEVER be achieved with undesirable means, they cannot be
fully trusted to not abuse the power that Clipper offers.

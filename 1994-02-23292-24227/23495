Is there a "standardized" way to decrypt a ciphertext file, such that
depending on which of two crypto keys was used, a different plaintext will
be produced?  The scenario is this: you and your computer are seized.
Encrypted files are found on the computer.  Upon threat of "dire
consequences", shall we say, you're ordered to supply the crypo key.  You
supply *A* crypto key, it works, and something "sensitive" and at least
marginally worthy of being encrypted is produced.  Hidden would be the fact
that had another key been used, what you really wanted to hide would have
been decrypted instead.

Offhand, doing it through straight crypto would probably produce a
ciphertext that was suspiciously large in proportion to the plaintext you
produced under duress.  I wonder if steganography would be a likely
candidate for this sort of operation?

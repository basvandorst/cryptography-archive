I finally got it to work, although there were a couple of errors in the
source code that had to be fixed first.  Additionally, as I recall, there was
a problem with "big endian" vs. "little endian" in the way it handled data.
After solving that, I did get it to where I could run it and the DES
file encryption included in the "SuperKey" s/w package, on the same plaintext
and key and produce identical results.  Of course, they both might have been
similarly flawed...

FWIW, the code had a lot of room for optimization, too.

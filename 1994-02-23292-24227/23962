The article say it conform to the strictest demands defined by
protection norm U1.

The computer is the result of a project done entirely within Sweden.
It is called SPC 486 SEC and include a 486SLC-processor, 4-16MB RAM,
40-210MB HD, a TFT-screen, a diskette drive, two serial ports, one
parallell port and four free card slots.
The computer, keyboard, screen and cables are said to be entirely
screened to not emit disclosing signals.

It is expected to be used by the Swedish defense, banks, insurance
companies, as well as all companies and institutions that handle
secret data. It might also help people who are allergic to
electronic emissions, a strange disease that has afflicted some
Swedes. Nearly all monitors sold in Sweden are now called
low-radiating, this is due to health fears.

It should be good for radio amateurs too, but the article doesn't
say that.

It is sold by SPC Trading in Uppsala.

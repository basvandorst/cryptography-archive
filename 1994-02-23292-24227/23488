Compression algorithms in the real world are not at all that good.
Their statistical models of plaintext are extremely simplified.  In
the usual case of adaptive compression, they don't adapt infinitely fast
nor do they store a tremendously complicated model of the plaintext as
seen so far.  Compression will make almost any cipher more secure, but
periodic XOR is so weak that an unknown plaintext attack still seems very
likely.  In addition, some compression algorithms put known 'magic
numbers' into their output. It would be well worth while to use
a more secure cipher than periodic XOR before compressing, even if
one is only interested in preventing unknown plaintext attack.
It is very likely that the compression will greatly magnify the
security difference between periodic XOR and something better--even
just a little bit better.

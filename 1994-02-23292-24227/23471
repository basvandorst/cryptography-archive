I predict that in countries where the government permits import of Clipper
phones they will be wildly succesful. There are lots of people who aren't in
the least worried if the USG can monitor them, but are very worried about
friends, neighbors, spouses, business competitors (in companies unlikely to
be able to afford suborning Clipper if it were possible), etc. etc.

No, the problem will be with foreign governments who don't have access to
the black boxes fearing THEIR local druggies, spies, etc. would use Clipper,
preventing imports.

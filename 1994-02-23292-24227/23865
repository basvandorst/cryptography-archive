Here is a (more or less) rigorous version:

Let's say that the number n has k factors, f1, ..., fk, where k >= 1.
Then the following inequality holds:

	fi <= n^(1/k)		for one i (1 <= i <= k),

because otherwise all fi are greater than n^(1/k) and multiplying the
fi would give a number greater than n.  This means that numbers with
more factors will tend to have at least one ``small'' factor, because
n^(1/k) tends to 1 as k tends to infinity.

(Paul, I'm not claiming that you are ignorant of this; I know better.
I'm just fooling around.)

Looking for a "lightweight" authentication protocol for a particular
application, we're thinking about the following...

V is the verifyer, P is system/person to be authenticated over an open
channel.  Initially V and P agree via a secure channel or some secure
key exchange method on two n-digit random numbers, call them k0 and k1.

The protocol V uses to verify P's identity over an open channel is:

	V generates a new n-digit random number, call it y, and sends P
	the challenge: k0 xor y

	P xors the challenge with k0 to recover y, then sends
	in response: k1 xor y

	V takes the response, xors it with k1, and compares
	the result with the y it sent to verify P's identity.

After each succesful authentication P and V both do:

	k0 = k1
	k1 = y

The new values of k0 and k1 are used in the next round of authentication.
In other words, authentication also performs a key exchange.

"Lightweight" in the sense that only xor arithmetic is necessary.

(Mutual authentication, if needed, should be easy.  Each side generates
a new random number and exchanges it with the other party.  As a
possibly-useful side effect, after each round of successful
authentication new values are available for both k0 and k1.)

Besides exhaustive tries, "man in the middle", or stealing k0 and k1,
we can't spot any other obvious attacks.  Are we missing anything?

There has been (at least in the British Media) some fuss recently
about the process whereby logons and passwords have been recorded
by some 3rd party thus giving that 3rd party access to various
machines across the net (particularly those that have a permanent
connection).
Can someone tell me more about this phenomenon and/or
how difficult it would be to implement the
following procedure:

1) Machine 1 requests access to Machine 2.
2) Machine 2 sends a public key and request for logon id and password.
3) Machine 1 sends encrypted logon and password.

Now I don't know a lot about encryption or Internet protocol,
but wouldn't this greatly reduce the risk of someone 'listening in'
and gaining unauthorised access to 'Machine 2' at a later date?
Any information will be appreciated.
Feel free to email me at n.j.dullaway@cranfield.ac.uk

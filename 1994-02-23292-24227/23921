Ok, how about this to foil the evil would-be tempist dudes.

Have two monitors, identical, in sync.

Feed the original signal into the monitor you want to look at, 
Subtract the signal from a random noise feed(such as from a diode, etc)

Show the noise on the other monitor.

(so what you have is a box with one input and two outputs)

The radiation summ of the two in the far field will be random noise:-)

Hell, if you were carefull, you would not even need a monitor, you could just
use an antena:-)(of course this could get you into fcc problems????)

      Here are additional results a propos the example cited in the
lead posting:

      1. N=2773
         X=2418
         X^23=471(mod N); GCD(472,N)=59
         (471 is one of the UFMs and 23 is a factor of phi(N))
      2. X^2=1240(mod N); GCD(1239,N)=59
      3. X^N=1887(mod N); GCD(1888,N)=59

      The lesson I learn from these results is this: since the transparency
of the system cannot be evaluated in advance, the choice of an exponent for
the random search of X is arbitrary. I suggest N, or N-1,N+1, as the likely
candidate. I would also limit the search for X to a region  (N)^1/1<X<N-1
and, of course, conduct it randomly.
      Try it and you may be suprised to find that it works!

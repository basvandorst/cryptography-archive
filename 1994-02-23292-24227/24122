This sounds like PGP in conventional mode (or any of a number of other
secret-key algorithms) with a wrapper which asks the question
and then runs the program with the answer as the pass phrase.

Eg.,

"Hi John.  What was the name of that woman you met on 1/12/89, out behind
building 3? "

Of course, anything like this is likely to be very insecure because the
pass phrase is likely to be easily guessable.

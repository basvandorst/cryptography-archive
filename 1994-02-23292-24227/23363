      Transparency in RSA Revisited.

      It is well known that in every RSA system there is a small set
of messages that cannot be encrypted for any odd exponent e>3. Such
messages are known as Universal Fixed Messages (UFM) and when found lead
immediately to the factorization of the system's modulus. However,
since the set of such messages is small searching for one in a large
system is no fun, even with an efficient search algorithm. Hence, their
presence appears to be of little consequence insofar as the security of
system is concerned.
      There are, however, other, non-UFM messages that are also transparent
to specific encrypting components. Recently, while experimenting with such
messages I have observed that frequently, but not always, the encrypting
exponents that are associated with such messages have a common factor with
the modulus, in short, compromise the system.
      Here is an example, used by Messrs. R, S and A in their original
paper:
      p=47
      q=59
      m=2773
      phi(m)=2668
      lambda(m)=1334.
In this system we readily find one of the UFMs, X=235 and, of course, find
that GCD(x+1,m)=q. We also find some other messages that are unencryptable,
      X=2418                             X=2209
      e=2209                             e=3481
      X^e=X(mod m)                       X^e=X(mod m)
      GCD(e,m)=p                         GCD(e,m)=q
I have tried other, much larger examples and find that this is not a
coincidence. I gather that the probability of these two conditions,
      GCD(e,m)=p or q
and
      X^e=X(mod m)
being satisfied simultaneously must be very low yet finding such transparent
messages appears to be much easier than finding UFMs, probably because they
are more numerous.
If you can shed some light on the subject and/or lend analytical support
please, post your comments here.

The most significant use I've heard of is in the oil industry.  
Seismographic data is encrypted before being transmitted back home for
analysis.  I think the results of analysis are also encrypted before 
being transmitted to the field operation.  It seems that some foreign
governments eavesdrop so that they can jack up the charges to extortion
levels.

The VP of Datotek gave us an interesting talk on real world crypto
use several years ago.

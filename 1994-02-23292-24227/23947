There are only a finite number of chips.  The NSA will have the key to
all of them.  The LEAF just saves them time, pointing to the specific
key they need.

LEAF mangled transmissions are still 'in the clear' to the government...
right now just to the NSA...but I am sure they would help out their good
buddies in the FBI, IRS, Alamedia Co. Sheriff's Department, Bexley Police
Department, K-Mart Security, etc. :)

After all, anyone who mangles a LEAF might will become one of their big fish.

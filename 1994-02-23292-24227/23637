   Quite a few of the Cypherpunks remailers do exactly this (this post was
chained through several of them). Ftp to soda.berkeley.edu I think the
directory is /pub/cypherpunks/remailers and get the file hal's_instructions
to find out how to use them. 

Some addresses:

hfinney@shell.portal.com
remail@extropia.wimsey.com
ebrandt @jarthur.claremont.edu
remailer@rebma.mn.org
catalyst@netcom.com
remailer@dis.org
qwerty@netcom.com

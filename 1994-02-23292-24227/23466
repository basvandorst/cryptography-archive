At a conference last year, I rather naughtily remarked to a senior NSA person
that all the suffering caused in the UK by bank claims that `we use encryption 
so our systems are infallible' could be used by NSA to make a case for banning 
civilian crypto entirely. People wanting secure communications could just use 
old-fashioned armoured cables filled with pressurised CO2. Banks could afford 
them (in fact they get used right now to carry alarm signalling).

He seemed genuinely shocked! He jumped and said no, no, no we don't want to 
ban encryption, we just want it used by responsible people.

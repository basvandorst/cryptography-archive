Or, if you'd like to try _commercial_ encrypting filesystem software
for dos and windows and DRDOS and PCDOS that allows you to work at
the individual _file_ or _directory_ level, even across network
shared filesystems (Novell, Lantastic, NFS, etc.) you can ftp to

netcom.com
cd /pub/bbosen/Enigma/PC-LanSafe

and get what's there. This is _crippled_ in that the cryptoalgorithms
are all replaced with a ridiculously weak character substitution
algorithm, but otherwise corresponds with our commercial software
so you can test it for compatibility and ease of administration.

I hope this is useful.

How so?  2 simple facts underlie his statements:

1) public servants, such as law enforcement, serve the public (us).
2) there have been many abuses of citizens (us) by such public servants.

He makes a single assertation:

3) the reason for #2 above is that public servants tend to forget who they
serve, and take advantage of their position.

I don't think that's an unreasonable presumption.

Au contraire!

 [more directly states that the Administration considers a "comprehensive
 approach" to crypto to be only one "which the Administration is developing.]

 [note that the negation here negates only the main clause of the quoted 
 passage, not the secondary clause.  In effect this says that the Admin. is
 not going to ban all cryptography {of course not; they are producing it
 themselves], but that it DOES consider crypto to threaten "public safety and
 ...law enforcement."]
>(as some countries have effectively done); 
 [The implication here is also clear: 'Other countries, by definition
 inferior, have banned crypto. The US govt is the most massive and powerful
 in the world, and if it wants to, it can and will ban crypto successfully.']

[...]

Note the last like.  That's a key statement.

Note the turn of phase "...nor is the U.S. saying...", implying not that
a decidedly disfavoured President and his advisors are saying something, 
but that _the United States of America_, as a single united unit, is
saying something.  This is of course absurd, as is most everything in the
press release, but most people are unlikely to notice this sort of thing,
and it will effectively work a lot of psychological voodoo.

Au contraire!

From a NIST response to a letter from PKP/RSADSI's Jim Bidzos

Despite the double-talk and -think in the language of this and other such
documents, including the original press release, the message is clear:
There are no _current_ plans to make Clipper mandatory, but their may be
in the future (this was confirmed later in a response to questions about
Clipper, where in it was stated that banning non-Clipper crypto was an
issue that would be considered.  I cannot provide quotes from that one, as
I don't have it handy.  When I find it I will be happy to do so.) 
Furthermore, the Administration may approve encryption schemes with _both_
effective crypto _and_ key-escrow (a contradiction in terms), but very
clearly implies that it will not approve (as if it has any right to
approve or disapprove) encryption without key-escrow. 

I can give other examples, but I am hungry and tired and have 200 emails
to read, so I will leave further research as an exercise for the reader.

The almost-off-the-record statement of low-rank govt. representatives does
not qualify as a "confirmation" of anything.  Even the President's own
press releases on the matter don't confirm, they simply attempt to skirt
the issue with weasel words.  

>Now there's nothing wrong with being careful, or questioning the government
>closely in this matter, 

That much is true.

<nod>

If you mean that this man's Usenet posts won't win any "wars" for us, this
is true, but I don't think it was intended to do so.  Looked like
expression of an opinion to me.  I also, personally, don't detect any
sarcasm, only irony, based on the what looks to be the reality of the
situation.

To sum up, until the Administration produces a VERY clear statement that:

1) Clipper absolutely positively will not ever be mandatory in any way for
anyone (other than, I suppose, people passing around "sensitive but not
classified" material as part of their govt. employee duties, as originally
suggested), and
 
2) Clipper is not intended to displace private sector, commercial
encryption products, and

3) that other forms of encryption, _even those with no key escrow of any
kind_, will absolutely positively never ever be prohibited, then

the only safe assumption that can be made is that 1, 2 and 3 are false,
and that we have to fight to make them true.  Any other course of action
is careless, apathetic, naive and dangerous.  Period.  The govt's feelings
won't be hurt, and they sky won't fall down, if 1, 2 and 3 actually ARE
true, and we just don't know it.  We're all in deep kim chee however if
they are false.  Better to "over react" and do no harm, than not react
fast enough, and lose a good measure of our privacy.

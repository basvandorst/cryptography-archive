Back when some conversations were recorded off Airforce 2's cellular, the 
US News Media claimed that the law says you can listen to cellular calls
all you want, but that you can't look for one PARTICULAR signal.  So you
can't listen for your neighbor's calls, but if you "happen" to be listening
and you "happen" to pick up your neighbor's calls, listen all you want.

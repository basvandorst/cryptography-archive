With all due respect, Alexis is awfully busy and might not get back to you in
time for his information to be of any use.

It's worth noting, however, that after we made the whole mess public, BARRnet
failed to completely hush up the fact that a sniffer program was discovered
running *ON THEIR BACKBONE*, and that the individual responsible was not
brought to justice.

BARRnet is a major regional network.  They connect thousands of times the
number of people that Panix does.  They also connect many if not most of the
major California-based computer vendors to the net, and the UC system and
Stanford universities.  

Think the Panix incident was bad?  BARRnet's sniffing problem quite literally
means that almost every site on the net was made insecure.  Do not _ever_ pass
unencrypted sensitive data over the network.  You must assume it will be
sniffed *on the backbone* of one of the networks it crosses.

BARRnet was not the only major regional to fess up to this problem following
the Panix incident.  At least two others were simply more successful in
hushing their disasters up.

I personally think you should obtain your own credit report, card numbers
included, over the Internet, and sue the provider of such information.

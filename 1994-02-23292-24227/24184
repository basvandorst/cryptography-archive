Once again, thanks for the useful contribution.

We both appear to believe the realities of commercially available "TEMPEST" 
equipment to be as follows:

		a. Swedish milspec U1 may or may not be the NATO TEMPEST 
standard (mil or commercial?) under a national nomenclature. Sweden as a 
traditionally neutral country has never been a member of NATO. Accordingly,
without specific information to the contrary, it is reasonable to assume that the standards are not the same.

		b. Spec U1 is not revealed to those who do not hold the 
requisite Swedish security clearance. Therefore an export customer for such a 
product is unable to establish the level of protection that he is acquiring. 

		c. Most purchasers of equipment certified to the commercial
TEMPEST spec will be as unable as those at b. above to understand precisely 
the quality of protection purchased.



Commercial grade TEMPESTed equipment is subject to export controls and to  
end-user approval. Is the same true of U1 equipment?

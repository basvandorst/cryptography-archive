   There was an interview/call-in session with William Sessions (former
head of FBI) on the Skipjack ("wiretap") chip and legal requirements for
easy access to peoples' phones for the government.  The discussion itself
was interesting, and there were a lot of callers (I don't recall a single
caller in favor of the idea).  However, there was one question I hoped
someone would ask, but that nobody thought of:  Will the rules for getting
access to escrowed keys be set up as policy, or as law?  Ie, how much
administrative overhead will there be before access to the escrowed keys
can be simplified or made easier?  If this is just current policy, what
reason do we have to believe that a new, more convenient policy won't be
adopted at some point in the future?
 
   For what it's worth, even a constitutional ammendment codifying even
more stringent requirements for escrowed key access wouldn't be enough to
make me accept this plan.  But it would be nice to know how far the US
gov't is willing to go with enforcing the scheme they've set up.

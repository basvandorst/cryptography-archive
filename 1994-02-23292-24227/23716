Its legal to use and own. Its NOT legal to transport it from the United 
States of America to a country outside the US border. In other words, do 
not export it from the U.S. 

RSA and PKP have a patent on the RSA algorithm, which is the public key 
cryptosystem used in PGP. IDEA is patented by an organization in Europe, 
I believe. RSA and PKP has virtually scared most US sites from carrying 
the cryptography software that uses their "patented algorithm." 

Another reason most US sites do not carry PGP/Secure Drive/et cetera 
is because of the export restrictions. When Phil originally wrote PGP, he 
placed it on a New Mexico site. Not long after, it was FTP'ed from a site 
out of the US. Result: It spread worldwide and the government tried to 
get Phil. 

Moral: You'll be better off *NOT* exporting it from the US (I know you 
didn't bring that up), and you'll be better off grabbing it from 
nic.funet.fi or equivelent.

There's a lot I don't know about how Clipper works (and perhaps nobody
knows). But, why can't I:

  - make Clipper send an incorrect key to the escrow agency (by
    twiddling its transmissions somehow) 

  - wait for Jack's Midnight Escrow Agency to be founded by some
    cypherpunk, or better yet, start my own. My friends and I can keep
    our Clippers happy by using this instead of the official one.
    (i.e. how does a Clipper chip make sure it is talking to 'the'
    escrow agency?)

   I think the best way to do this would be to have each user register his
   public key with the remailer when he joins up. The remailer also has a [key]

A message to a remailer can have one of three+ destinations
1) A known user
1.5) A local user, including the bit-bucket
2) A known remailer
3) An unknown user (who may of course be a remailer)

If you depend on the remailer to encrypt its outgoing traffic, you
are susceptible to attacks by corrupt remailer operators.
Some are obvious (remailer@dockmaster.ncsc.gov :-), but some may
either be narcs or good guys being coerced or with their machines cracked.
So it's usually worth sending mail to known users encrypted with their
public keys, packaged inside of whatever you mail through the remailer,
so that even if the remailer is corrupt, all they get is traffic analysis.
This does open up a minor traffic analysis attack, since requests to
public-key servers will *probably* be monitored...
But it leaves the encryption under the control of the user,
and leaves the computation load on the user's machin instead of the server.

On the other hand, for known remailers, it may be worth using the
remailer's public key anyway, as added security.

Two interesting features  worth developing:
1) A public-key server (or information server in general),
that accepts encrypted input and replies with encrypted output.
It could either keep public key records to use for replies,
or accept public keys in mail requests (obviates record-keeping
and lets non-registered people get requests privately),
or it could skip the public-key calculations entirely and use the same
private key for replies that was used for the request.

2) Batching remailers - if remailers could accept batches of mail in
one message, encrypted so you can't tell what's in it,
then it simplifies the problem of size-based traffic analysis -
instead of padding messages, you can pad batches of mail sent to
the remailer, or just let the mixing of messages from multiple sources
to popular remailers take care of the problem.
It also lets you add mail to "nobody" to do padding if you want.

...and by Gore and in the general press and by comments from people like
Bobby Inman and in legislative langauge.

Who is this Sternlight character REALLY?

There has never, to the best of my knowledge, been a proclamation by 
these civil servants that it would be IMPROPER for them to promote
such prohabition.

At best, there is an appearance of impropriety in the words issuing 
from the Feds in their refusal to make a statements of principle in
response to these well-motivated concerns.

At worst, they are optimizing their posture for some later ploy by
avoiding statements of principle.

PS:  I thought I had put Sternlight in my kill file and all of a 
sudden here he appears again, lighting up my life with warm fuzzy
smarminess about how the Feds are just a bunch of pussy cats doing
wonderful things a third of my gross.

Isn't there a "final solution" mode in the kill file logic?

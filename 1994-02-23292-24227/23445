Forgive the question of a cryptography newbie, but all the debate over
these 'clipper' chips seems a bit silly; why hasn't anyone put an
RSA type algorithm on a big MPU (like the motorola MC68030 series).

Would solve the problem nicely IMHO, and, though a formidable programming
(and possibly hardware, depending on how many instruction cycles it
would take to encrypt a given byte, one might have to paralell a couple
of MPU's) task, it seems do-able.

Could someone give me a clue as to how many 'cycles' of CPU time it
might take to encrypt a given byte?
100?
1000?
10000?
100000?

I could certainly design something to A/D convert, say, a phone conversation
compress it & do >~10000 cycles on it & have a similar circuit to
to the reverse. Another order of magnitude would be do-able with some loss of
sound quality...

Any comments to this, please followup to e-mail as I do not read this
group...

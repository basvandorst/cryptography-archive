I have heard of something called a key server which,
presumably, is a place where people put there public keys and these
places are (hopefully) tamper secure.
this was a fairly old reference, tho. (93)
Does anyone know if key servers still exists, where they are 
and how you interact with them?
Also if they are secure.

Thanks

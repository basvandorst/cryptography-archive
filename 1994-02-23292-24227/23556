What is the relation of the CCW to the session key? Is it a hash? Also,
could you let me in on the typology of the chips and algorithms. For
example, is there a CCEP type II?

Who is doing this extraction & insertion? Skipjack? Do we know anything
about the key generation (e.g., random noise generator used,
time-stamping)? Would the algorithm be MUCH more secure with a key of 15
or 20 bytes?

What is a typical CCEP I protocol? How do the keys get generated,
distributed, and changed?

Sorry if these questions are too elementary but I've never worked for the
USG.

I'm tired of hearing how AT&T is eager to put Clipper technology
into it's products.  I know it's a small thing but I'd like to
write them a letter telling them I'll be passing on products with
the AT&T logo.

Does anyone know the best address to write to at AT&T when making
a statement like this?

Thanks,

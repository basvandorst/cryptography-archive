 In addition to the several discussions of this point in this group, wasn't 
there a presentation at RSA Conf '93 (Martin Hellman?) that set out to 
quantify the issue and to prognosticate the probable safelife of RSA key 
lengths, given the growth trend in computational power? As I remember it, his 
prognostication was that 512 bit might well be suspect against a major power's
 attack now but that 1024 bit keys are probably good into the next century (by
 which time 2048 bit keys should be a commonplace).

Anyone have a copy of the paper?

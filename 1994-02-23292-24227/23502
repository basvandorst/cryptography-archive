No, there wasn't.  Sure, the book said it was DES, and the functions were
named something like "des_encrypt" etc, and it encrypted and decrypted fine.
 
However, it was really not DES.  I tried it -- it didn't encrypt the DES
test example given in the DES standard properly.  It was incompatible with
other DES packages (it couldn't decrypt what those other packages had
encrypted, and vice versa).
 
I found this out when looking for a DES package that was as fast as possible.
At that time I had two DES implementations: the one in NR, and another one
from Dr Dobb's.  The NR implementation was somewhat faster -- but
unfortunately didn't encrypt/decrypt like DES (this was necessary since
encrypted data was to be sent to another party where it was to be decrypted
by an altogether different DES implementation).  I ended up optimizing the
Dr Dobb's DES implementation instead (unrolling loops and stuff like that).
 
Admittedly the "DES" code in NR 1st edition was very DES-like.  But somewhere
they got the implementation wrong.  Perhaps that's part of the reason it
was removed in the 2nd edition ??

It's not easy to say, and really requires the careful analysis of a
specialist.  But to be on the safe side, assume it's not very strong.

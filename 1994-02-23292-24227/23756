Well, the algorithm that converts the given string to encrypted form is
 non reversible. The "key" of the encryption is the 2 first characters of
 the password in the password field. The password field always has a length
 of 13 (unless the sysadm uses password aging etc but forget that). However
 that key is by no means secret and the security of the algorithm is not
 based on it.

At some time of their life, everyone's a newbie..:)

Wrong, the crypt FUNCTION is used which, like i sais before, is non reversible.
 The only way to break a password is to a:) use Crack (a password guessing
 program) or b) brute force attack (would take a century or so)
 As for the crypt command, it's not really used much any more, not since
 cbw is around (crypt's breaker workbench or something) which breaks the
 crypted file FAST. Check an ftp site for that (ftp.funet.fi for one).

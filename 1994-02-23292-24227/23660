	Here's another argument against Clipper that I haven't heard 
mentioned before:

	Any key escrow standard which makes it into common use by 
citizens and law enforcement personel will hamper the development of
new communications technologies, independent of encryption.

	If the Clipper should succeed in gaining wide acceptance,
it will be used for most digital transmissions, and most police departments
and other law-enforcement agencies will be equipped with the black
box for decoding these transmissions using the escrowed key.

	In order for these black boxes to work easily for the police,
not only will the digital encryption protocols have to be standardized,
but also the encoding used for transmitting the 1's and 0's over
the wiring. If new modem technologies, or other forms of transmission
are developed after Clipper has achieved wide success, they will have
not only the usual problems of getting users to pay the high initial
costs, but the new problem of strong resistance from the law-enforcement
community who may have to upgrade zillions of little black boxes. This
will lead to a slowing of technological advancement, and probably
to more proposals to limit new communications technologies to those
which can be easily tapped (as the FBI tried to do a little
while back).

	Perhaps if the Clipper had been widely adopted 5 years ago,
I'd be typing this at 2400 baud right now.

On this group, I've long been pushing

	des|tran|des|tran|des

as a stronger form of triple-DES.  It has the advantage of a *very* big block
(the whole message or 8KB, whichever is smaller).

tran is available on ripem.msu.edu or from me (the version from me has no key
spec, so that it's not an encryption program -- just a byte manipulator, like
compress or gzip).  It's probably time for me to post the keyless one again.

So, using the tran from me, you end up with only 3 keys -- the three DES keys.
You might use CBC mode for one of the DES's (e.g., the first one), and keep
its IV secret, but that gives you only another 64 bits of key.

If you want a *huge* amount of keying material, (and if you have a version of
DES (probably S/W) which takes no extra time to switch keys, once they're set
up) you can use the middle DES with a set of N different keys through which
you rotate.  That is, the middle DES becomes:

	c_i = DES( p_i, k_i )

where  k_i = K_{i mod N}, for some (possibly large) N.

This way you have N+2 DES keys and probably 1 IV for the cryptanalyst to
detect.  The running time is roughly that of normal triple-DES.

P.S.  In my original suggestion, I had all three DES instances be CBC.
Eli Biham's attack on triple CBC (although unlikely in practice) has caused
me to revise that suggestion.  For maximum security, I would use ECB mode
for each of the DES and use a prngxor() stage to mask repeated plaintext.
Barring that, I would use CBC mode only for the first DES.

P.P.S.  My account at cme@sw.stratus.com or cme@isis.com is still active.
I'm just branching out, here. :-)

I know Philip Zimmermann personally, and can vouch for the fact that he
believes that putting back doors in encryption systems is immoral.  It
would also weaken the system against attacks by criminals, enemy spys,
etc.  No way could you convince him to put a back door in.  Besides, I've
examined the source code and believe that I understand it.  There are no
back doors in either the freeware or Viacrypt PGP.  That is why the NSA
and Department of State are upset...

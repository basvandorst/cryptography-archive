Encrypted file systems are pretty useful. People are using them now. 
(free examples include SECDRV for MSDOS, CFS for various Unix 
platforms, kfs for Sun OS, SFS for MSDOS). This is one of the few 
ways to secure data on a computer that is actually pretty hard to 
crack. 

Banks and financial institutions use encryption to secure 
transactions.  

Email is a special case of file transmission. People use programs like
PGP to transmit data over an insecure medium (like the Internet). Very
convenient for source code; you can put it up for anon ftp and only
the intended recipient(s) can read it.

The U.S. government uses "secure" phones which use some kind of public
key algorithm. 

A few other applications that come to mind that people really do use: 
Kerberos, Secure NFS, the Unix password hash function [crypt(3)]. 

More generally, cryptography is an essential part of computer and 
network security.

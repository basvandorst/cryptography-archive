   Leaving aside algorithms that make factoring faster independently of key
   size (we'd really be in hot water there), it's starting to look as if we'd
   have to abandon factorable cryptography, i.e. RSA etc. at about the time
   their patents expire or we'll start having keys which are often longer than
   the messages they're supposed to protect.

The assumptions that were made that 45 years from now, a 1024 bit number
would be factorable implied that computers would get a *lot* faster.
Even assuming that is powerful (exponential growth curves don't last
forever), you can simply just used 2048 and 4096 bit numbers.  Adding
one bit does not make RSA take much longer; but it adds significantly to
the factoring difficulty.

Of course, if someone finds a fast way to factor numbers independent of
key size, all bets are off.  Of course, there's a similar chance that
someone finds some neat attack on all Festel-class cyphers, in which
case even Skipjack might be vulnerable.  And, there's a chance that a
comet might impact the earth and end Life As We Know It.  Life is full
of risks.

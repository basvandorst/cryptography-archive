That's one form of spread spectrum. The other form uses a
pseudo-random noise sequence (PNSeq) as a larger code. Each "bit" of
that PNSeq is called a chip. One spreads a data-bit over multiple
chips. A correlator in a receiver can know what PNSeq is being used to
transmit and can recover the data-bits from the received chips. The
data is spread over a very wide bandwidth and can be transmitted below
the local noise floor.

For the kind I speak of, no.

For the kind you describe, yes, but they have to know the algorithm to
choose the next frequency.

I've read, on this newsgroup, that frequency hopping units change
frequencies so "slowly" that the Feds can listen in, if they want to.

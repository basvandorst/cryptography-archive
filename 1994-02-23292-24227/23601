	Say you had an anonymous mail server which worked via PK cyptography:
people using the service would encrypt their messages using the public key
of the server. The server would then decrypt them and forward the plaintext.
The reason for doing it this way would be so that a hypotetical (:-)) third
party which was capable of capturing all traffic would be able to see
who sent anonymous mail, and what anonymous mail went out, but would be 
unable to match up the encrpyted text with the plaintext output.

	Obviously, there'd be some obvious things to avoid in order to
prevent the matching; you'd want to pad messages so that message length
woudln't be a give-away; you'd want to send a day's transmissions out
in a batch, in random order, so that time of transmission wouldn't
tell much, etc.

	Assuming that the underlying cryptographic method was good, how
secure would such a scheme be? would it be a lot easier to correlate
the encypted message with its plaintext then it would be to break
the encryption? 

	No, I'm not planning on setting up such a service, but am
just curious.

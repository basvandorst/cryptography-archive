Unix uses a non-invertible function (I think) to encrypt its passwords.  

When you type in your password, Unix encrpyts it, and compares it with the
encrypted version stored in the password file.

However, the encryption function is a one-way function.  Obtaining the original
password from the cipher is, at best, a very hard (years of computer time)
problem, and I think it might even be mathematically impossible.


The Unix password encryption itself is quite secure.  However, many OTHER
things about how Unix handles passwords are NOT secure.  8 character passwords
make guessing/brute force possible (along with the ability for users to choose
their own passwords--many still do things like use their mother's name), and
the fact that passwords are transmitted UNENCRYPTED over the network (from
terminal to host) makes interception quite possible.

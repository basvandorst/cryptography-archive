: Oh well, we should all remember that Big Brother IS watching, anyway.
: Also, has anyone ever wondered what the *real* reason is behind Al
: Gore's push for widestread access to what he calls the "Information
: Superhighway" (ugggh! I hate to hear that being used to refer to the
: Internet and Usenet, etc.)?  Has anyone else stopped to think that
: this could just be an easier way for the federal government to keep
: better track of everyone and with whom various people keep in contact
: with?  It's certainly much easier to watch over us all that way than
: watching everyone's mail as it goes through the post office!  It's bad
: enough that NSA can listen to our telephone conversations.  Think
: about it and shudder!  ...and never forget: Big Brother IS watching,
: and listening, and does want to know more about YOU!

This is the reason why we should all be using anonymous remailers and
encryption for private email. Its a hassle though and looking like illegal
to boot!

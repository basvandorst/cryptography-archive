Perhaps the emotion in this group reflects more than an anti-government
reflex.
The Clipper proposal is an effort to lock in a standard that could easily
proliferate in a few years to every computer and telephone in the US. For
something with such broad implications, why should we trust the NSA whose
overriding concern is always the ability to read any traffic from any
source at any time. Anything that compromises that ability will be
opposed by the agency at all times and under all circumstances. Civil
rights are merely a tactical obstacle for them. 
Among the many troubling aspects of the Clipper proposal consider just
one:
Why is SKIPJACK good enough for us, but not at all good enough for
classified information?
In other words, if the only way to decrypt a message is with the escrowed
keys, than why should a weak algorithm be used? Why not use a very secure
system. What is it about SKIPJACK that disqualifies it from use for
classified information?

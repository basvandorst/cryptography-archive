:Actually, if one proves that P=NP is unprovable, then doesn't that mean that
:one has proved that one can't find a counterexample? (I.e., they might
:exist, but we don't know how to get them). So one would still not know
:if P=NP was true or not.

Let me note the following.

 1. Proving that "(P=NP) is unprovable in all consistent
deductive systems containing, e.g., (Peano) arithmetic" means
that adding the proposition "P=NP" to the arithmetic makes it
inconsistent (implies "0=1"!), i.e., by "reductio ad absurdum",
"not(P=NP)" is provable in the arithmetic (a conterexample is
any NP-complete problem).

 2. Vice versa, proving that "not(P=NP) is unprovable in all
these theories" means that the proposition "P=NP" is provable in
the arithmetic (a universal polinomial deciding procedure for
this case is known but it is practically useless).

 3. Therefore deductive undecidability of the proposition "P=NP"
in "all interest theories" implies INCONSISTENCY of ARITHMETIC (!)
that is hardly probable.

 4. Unprovability of both "P=NP" and "not(P=NP)" in one particular
theory means only that the used theory is too weak to solve the
problem (may be, all known reliable theories now are such).

 5. Deciding the problem P?NP is hardly able to do something with
practical tasks, since in the real world we deal with finite
computers, working relatively short time, NOT with asymptotic
constructions, arbitrary degrees and coefficients as in P?NP
problem. (Imagine that someone proves "P=NP", but the polinomial
deciding procedure working time for all known interest
NP-complete problems is not less than (10000*n)**10000, where n
is the binary input length... Well, what of that?..)
Unfortunately, proving theorems about finite computers with
relatively simple programs is too hard mathematical task.
Nevertheless, perhaps, someone will be able to prove a finite
analog of "P=NP" for our world and will find an efficient
deciding procedure for it, not solving the common P?NP problem.
And then he will crush a lot of encryption schemes. Therefore
it seems to me that some encryption schemes are mathematically
more unreliable than they are usually thougt of.

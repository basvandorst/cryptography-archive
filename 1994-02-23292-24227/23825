Yes, you find these tales in "Spycatcher" and the more recent "Spycatcher's Encyclopedia of Espionage".  Both written by Peter Wright who was once at MI5.

If I remember correctly, the TEMPEST attack against the French cipher machines was conducted by connecting an oscilloscope to the power lines leading to the embassy.  Both the low grade and high grade ciphers were compromised.

Tuning in to local oscillators of radio receivers was, I think, done in an attempt at detecting when the bad guys (The KGB) *listened* to their radios as a form of traffic analysis.

BTW, is "Spycatcher" still banned in the UK??

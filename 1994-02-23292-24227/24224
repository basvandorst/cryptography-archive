The entire transmission is probably hash/checksumed etc to make
modifications impossible to slip throgh.

You don't talk to the escrow agency.  They get your key at the
time the chip is manufactured, before you ever see it.  They know
how to peek inside your transmisions to get your key number.
Then they look it up in their DB, and decode your message.

You're none the wiser and your clipper did not have to talk to
anyone other than the actual intended reciepiant.  They will tap
you and go to the escrow agency for you.

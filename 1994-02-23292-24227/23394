I believe the code you are talking about is TeleTypeSetter code, a
remnent of the early application of computers to publishing.
TTS code is a six bit code, with shift characters similar to
the LTRS and FIGS characters of five-bit Baudot code, except
they have names that apply to Linotype machines (Upper Rail and
Lower Rail, if I remember correctly).

Although the code should be able to represent 124 characters
[ 2 * ( 2*6 - 2 shift characters) ], I believe if represents
slightly less, because a few frequently used characters, like
space, are the same in both shifts.  (This was also done in
Baudot code.)

If you are an old timer, like me, you may remember that when you
ordered new checks from your bank, there used to be a little strip
of punched paper tape in a slot in the check reorder form.  That
was the typesetting instructions for your checks, encoded in
TTS code.  They don't seem to do that any more.

One curious aspect of TTS code is that the code as represented in
various code tables did not exactly reflect what was punched in
the tape--one column was in a different position.  (Apparently they
wired the paper tape readers funny.  I heard about a user of
an early DEC typesetting system (PDP-8 or PDP-11), who had to
write a program to swap the columns around before he could read
in any of the standard utility software that was distributed on
tape for the machine.)

If you're *really* interested in this code, I have a crib sheet for
it at home.  Drop me an email....

There is another six bit code that was used on some IBM gear called
SBT, or six-bit trancode.  It has nothing to do with TTS code.

Cheers,

Lynn

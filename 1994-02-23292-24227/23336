A similar system already exists *and* is commercially available.  The design
of the system is to *reduce* noise.  I am sure you can easily change the program
to select for noise.  It does not use two sources, it uses two matched 
detectors!  Pretty expensive if you just want to waste it getting perfect noise!

Why not just get a detector and a piece of radioactive material, with some
thing automated to pick up the readout.  Select the middle or last digit for
your random number.  Sample every (minute/second/millisecond).  Or just go for
on/off for deadtime, for detections within your sampling time, for odd or even
number of detections...  Or pick them all at different times so your opponent
cannot even guess.
You can vary the timescale by selecting the radioisotope (by half-life). 

The more complex you get, the more expensive, easy to break down, and =if
anyone happens to remember the original post that started this thread= not
able to be made from common parts and stuck on or in your common computer.
(Sure, *I'm* going to buy a complex $20,000 radiation counter to tack on to
 my piece of trash $1,000 computer.  Ri-ight.)

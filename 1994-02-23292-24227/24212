This is off the subject, really, but coincidentally I just read
last night (in a 1979 issue of Pascal News) that longtime
DES implementer and sci.crypt contributor Jim Gillogly was
a "renowned chess programmer" and author of the successful
chess program "Technology".  

I would think that the two areas do involve similar skills.

(Sorry for the diversion.)

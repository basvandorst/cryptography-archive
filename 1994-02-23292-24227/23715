Summary: recreating the wheel

Looking at plain text versus cypher text in a statistical sense
i've discovered i can't.

Where do I find work done on word distributions and analysis on
how the words are most/least commonly formed in the english 
language. 

Yes I realize that I could collect a huge text library of common
english and statistically analyze it myself. It just seems like
doing work that's been done before is wasteful.  Not to mention
I don't have the disk space :)


Thanks a lot.

The problem with this, throughout a network, you can pass the data
round in encrypted form, you can store it on disk in encrypted form.
But the encryption is only as strong as the weakest link.  When the
signals go to the tty, or the screen, from my understanding of
TEMPEST, this is where the capture occurs.  TEMPEST is a more covert
way of eavesdropping than wiretaps, but with all the electrical
activity in the room, surely this must provide some protection.
Couple this with mains spikes, surges, and this must make it
incredibly difficult to isolate the signal you wish to capture.
Plus having to enhance this signal so that you could use it must make
this task all but impossible.
Effective shielding of equipment is a method of defeating this.
Another way could be to configure the hardware and the OS to establish
a key, so that all transmissions  to the terminal right up to where
the data is displayed on the screen, is encrypted.  Too much  to ask I
think.
The main weakness of any system subject to this kind of intrusion is
the display.  Work on this, and you may have a solution.
Just as I was typing this, the terminal decided that everything on
screen would be mapped on to the extended character set.  This seemed
to be the best encryption I have ever seen.:)

I'm looking for vcrplus software that supports 8 digit codes. I'm
not sure if the Fortran program published recently does this, so
I'm looking for this too. (The original c code only supports 6 digits).

If rec.video and/or sci.crypt is archived somewhere, I'd also like
a pointer to that.

Thanks
DaveR

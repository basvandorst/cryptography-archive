Encourage it's use in telecomms, and versions will also be available for
computer peripherals.

Some net.paranoids say so, but there is no evidence of this.

Well, it was designed by the NSA - draw your own conclusion.
The law enforcement agencies will have access, through court orders, to the
escrowed keys.  Giving protection from most eavesdroppers, whilst allowing
FBI & local police to retain telephone taps as an investigative tool
for homicide, rape, kidnap, drug smuggling.  (There were 900 such court
orders in the US in 1992).  I would suggest this is a reasonable objective,
others on the net have different opinions.

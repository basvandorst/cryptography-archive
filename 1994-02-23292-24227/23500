Did I read the above correctly, that it is illegal for one to attempt
to protect oneself from electronic surveillance?  If so, there is
something very wrong with that law!  I would suppose that one of the
best countermeasures is to generate lots of random "garbage" signals
that confuse those who are watchone one.

Oh well, we should all remember that Big Brother IS watching, anyway.
Also, has anyone ever wondered what the *real* reason is behind Al
Gore's push for widestread access to what he calls the "Information
Superhighway" (ugggh! I hate to hear that being used to refer to the
Internet and Usenet, etc.)?  Has anyone else stopped to think that
this could just be an easier way for the federal government to keep
better track of everyone and with whom various people keep in contact
with?  It's certainly much easier to watch over us all that way than
watching everyone's mail as it goes through the post office!  It's bad
enough that NSA can listen to our telephone conversations.  Think
about it and shudder!  ...and never forget: Big Brother IS watching,
and listening, and does want to know more about YOU!

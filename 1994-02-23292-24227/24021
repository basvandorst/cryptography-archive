Please DO NOT post further chemistry queries to sci.crypt - which is for
the discussion of cryptography, cryptology, cryptanalysis and related
technologies and issues.

'fibre glass' is produced from layers of woven mats of glass fibres
placed in a mould and bonded with plastics resin.  This gives a strong
and lightweight composite material.

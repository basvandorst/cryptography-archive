 Agreed. One of the worst I've seen is D'Bridge Front end mailer. I
 downloaded the thing (back when I was at 2400 baud) for nearly an hour,
 installed it, configured it. . . When I tried to RUN it, it said I
 would have to call the author to get a temporary registration number.
 Needless to say, I went to FrontDoor immediatly. (Although I'm not
 using any front end mailer with WWIV. I'm not in Fidonet. Some of the
 policies are rediculous).

 The same goes with copy protected commercial software. If I can't find
 a crack for it, it goes one of two places: 1) Back to where I bought it
 or to the manufacturer, 2) INto the junk pile.

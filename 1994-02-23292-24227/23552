Just my $0.02 worth on the subject of escrowed keys and how to prevent 
decoding of messages sent either before a wiretap order was issued or after it 
was expired. 

Rather than having the escrow agent pass the keys to some other agency (even 
protected from looking inside the "Black Box") why not have the agency that 
got the wiretap send the wiretap information to the escrow agent for decoding 
along with a currently valid wiretap order. This solves the problem of the 
agency (FBI, etc.) from continuing to use the keys or have access to them for 
a known plaintext attack to try and get a permanet set of keys. It also 
prevents the agency (FBI,etc.) from decoding information from a wiretap the 
predates the authorizing court order assuming that the date/time of the 
original encoding is included in the clipper protocol.

Any comments on this approach. I understand that the two escrow agents would 
probably have to make some arraingements to hand to two halves of the key but 
keeping the keys out of the hands of the actual wiretappers seems like a good 
balance.

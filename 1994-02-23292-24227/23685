I love the comparison between NSA and the brilliant madmen.  But I think 
that the NSA isn't out to save the world, but just to try to keep the 
status quo.  Im all for progressive change, not upheaval.  Has any of 
this discussion ever been forwarded to the top government officials?  
Maybe someone could see the light and make a policy change that would 
affect the spooks.

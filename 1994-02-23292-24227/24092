Link this to the change allowing archiving of information
without a warrent, and you have a system powerfull enough
to corrupt saints.

With even a CIA counter-espionage cheif bribable for a measly
1.5 million, this "signaling" information might as well have
a "For Sale" sign on it, as this info isn't even encrypted 
with Clipper. I wonder how long it would be before the Phreaks 
and Crackers would figure out how to access these backdoors 
directly. If every piece of hardware has one, and they must 
all be easily accessable at all times, the security hole 
opened will make the Internet Worm a mear footnote.

I do not understand how these officials can overlook the 
problems inherent these "enhancements". They are competant
enough to create this multi-phase law enforcement debacle
in such a way as it is hard to argue against any ONE clause,
yet to have a summation of them that gives such power to the
executive branch of government.

And fewer every time they announce a change. 

Maybe they have no need to make all other encryptions 
illegal, when they have the ease of knowing where you are
every time you sneeze, how much your credit card is getting
authorization for, where you get gas and how much....

Agreed. The power may even be more than THEY realize, but
I doubt that. It's too deliberate.

At least a few of the congress-critters are starting to 
listen, Thanks EFF.

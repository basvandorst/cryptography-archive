I'm having great difficulty coming up with a way
to express how glad I am that David and I can agree
on something.

And how, this FBI bill (Bill) will effect a lot more
than just routers. Do Stress the $$, people react 
when being hit in the wallet. I deal with networks
with hundreds of nodes, and this would obsolete nearly
all of the routers. This would be hell just to code,
not to mention systems support. Serious $$.

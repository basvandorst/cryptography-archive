But adding P=NP to the theory gives a different theory.

Doesn't it only imply that ARITHMETIC+(P=NP) is inconsistent (i.e. ARITHMETIC
by itself is still ok)?

Imagine the goedel (sp?) sentence "This sentence is false". This sentence is
unprovable (i.e. unclassified), because including it or its negation in the
theory causes an inconsistency. So we simply don't add it to the theory. How
is the P=NP question any different?

Exactly. So if one can prove that the question of P=NP is unprovable in a
given theory, then doesn't that only mean that the theory is proved to be
too weak to decide the question?

I apologize if there is some basic concept I am forgetting.

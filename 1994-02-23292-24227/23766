    Henry Kissenger (secretary of state under Nixon) once said, "Even paranoids 
have *real* enemies."  All the official announcements have denied any intent 
to outlaw competing methods of encryption, but words are cheap, especially 
coming from the mouths of politicians.  Most people posting on the net have 
a great degree of skepticism about the government's announced intentions.  The 
evidence most cited by them is the fact that an escrowed key system is useless
if other methods of encryption are available.  (Who would use an insecure system
if a secure system is available?)  As for myself, I see three possible scenarios:

1) The government will move to ban competing cryptosystems when law enforcement 
officers run into a code they cannot break.  Preferably the code user will be 
a white supremacist or neo-nazi to boot; that will shut up the ACLU.  This could 
happen in about two weeks since all the crime rings already have access to good 
encryption.  Probability (IMO): 50%

2) The escrowed key arrangement is really intended to allow monitoring of 
government communications for the purposes of oversight (no more Lt. Col.
Oliver North incidents).  The NSA wants to sell the chips to the public
at large simply to help amortize deveopment costs of the chip (or perhaps 
to provide the NSA with a "slush fund," you never know).  Probability: 10%

3a)  The government thinks were all really really stupid and will use the
clipper chip even when competing cryptosystems are available.  When it
turns out we won't, they'll just give up.  Probability: 38%

3b)  The government is right:  We all are really really stupid.  Clipper
will enter widespread use and the government will wiretap in pretty 
much the same fashion they do now (ie, according to the proscriptions
of the law, sort of, most of the time.)  Probability: 2% (Ok, so I'm an 
optimist.)

Some people on the net believe that the NSA will keep copies of ALL the 
keys, (ostensilbly, at least) for puposes of monitoring communications
coming into and out of the US or between two points outside the US.  The
NSA does not need a court order to monitor such transmissions.  However,
the potential for abuse is very great (monitoring dissident politcal
groups, for example).

I agree that the *intended* objective you state is reasonable (except for 
drug smuggling); it's the actual result of the policy that may not be so
reasonable.

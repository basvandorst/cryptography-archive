The way I understand it, the equipment is exportable, that is, export
is not controlled. Anyone who can afford it may buy one.
As the U1 standard is secret it is impossible to verify that the
equipment conform to it. You can try to measure the radiation from
it, I don't know if this is enough. Maybe there is a bug that
transmit information using spread-spectrum, maybe it is so cleverly
done that the bug is undetectable. Maybe there is no bug.
This is true for all secret tempest standards.
Maybe you have a good lab so that you can determine that radiation
is so low that you can rule out every bug, but then, it might just
be timed, so that it send only in reply to a signal.

All depend on how paranoid you are, how important you think the
Swedish defense think keeping secrets versus knowing the secrets
of others.

As a minimum distinction from an interface perspective to a CCEP type I
chip, the MYK-78 allows you to fish for a Cryptographic Check Word (CCW).

When entering in the key (10 Bytes), a CCW is also entered (3 bytes).
The MYK-78 allows you to read out the correct CCW and re-enter the key
followed by the correct CCW, allowing you to generate keys.

A CCEP type I chip would not allow read out of the correct CCW, requiring
you to rely on a central key generation authority.  (Which would also
make key escrow moot.)

Heh heh...  I did an Atari cartridge back in '82.  Efficiency was more
important that power.  There is just so much you can do in a 76 microsecond
horizontal sweep...avoiding indexing across page boundaries (costs an
extra cycle) is the kind of minutiae you had to attend to.

Considering that the current crop of video games is just getting to
16-bit processors, I'd be surprised if techniques have changed much.

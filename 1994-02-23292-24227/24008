Triple-DES in encrypt-decrypt-encrypt mode, with three different keys,
is no stronger or weaker than encrypt-encrypt-encrypt.  When triple-DES was
first proposed by IBM, they chose the former mode because it was backwards
compatible with single DES.  By setting the seocnd and third key equal,
triple-DES in EDE mode is the same as single DES.

There are reasons to use three different keys versus two keys; my book
gives an explanation of that.

More interestingly is the difference between encrypting each block three
times and chaining with the result, versus three different passes of DES
in CBC mode.  Bihman has a paper showing that the first is stronger (to be
published sooner or later in a Springer volume), and Kaliski also has
some results on the topic (presumably to be published somewhere).

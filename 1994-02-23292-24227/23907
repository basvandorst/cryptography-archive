I think these days it's harder to get a patent overturned on the grounds that
it is obvious. Typically, (or so I've heard) the benefit of the doubt will go
to the inventor.  If you can find prior art though it should be doable.  But I
do agree, I would think this is obvious ... you're just training/testing for
negatives as well as positives.

Hmm, could be, I would think it depends on the type of error ... if you're
error is high frequency and so are your patterns you've obviously got a
problem, but if you've got low frequency errors and high frequency patterns I'd
think it would still work.

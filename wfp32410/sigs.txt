   About the .SIG File

WinFront for PGP and QuickFront for PGP
contain a file called either
   
    winfront.sig  or
    qkfront.sig

depending on your product. You can test the 
EXE file (winfront.exe or qkfront.exe) against
the signature file ensure that the EXE file that
is in the package is the same one which Ugali 
International Corp. originally shipped.

To test the EXE from DOS:

  1) Get our key from http://www.ugali.com/key.html and add it to 
     your keyring. 

  2) switch to the directory containing the EXE and 
     the SIG

  3) type:

      pgp winfront.sig winfront.exe

    or

     pgp qkfront.sig qkfront.sig

  4) if the exe file is ok, you will receive
     the message:

      Good signature from user "Ross Barclay <ross@barclay.net>".
      Signature made 1996/xx/xx xx:xx GMT using 1024-bit key, key ID 307490ED

  5) if you recieve a message that the file and the signature do not match,
     please download the package again from another site

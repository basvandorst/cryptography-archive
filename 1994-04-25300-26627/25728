Probably the answer is DES.  It is available in hardware & software,
there are no royalties.  The downside is it is hard to test and debug,
and it is not as fast (s/w) as some more modern algorithims.

Another problem is that DES is theoretically breakable with a $1 million
custom machine.  If you are using ECB (Electronic Code Book) mode common
data blocks (eg all 0's) are readily identifiable and allow such a known
plaintext attack.

You'll have to check what the current rules on exporting single DES are,
but it is readily available outside the US.  TDES is widely regarded as
much more secure, but is unlikely to be be exportable from the US and is
obviously slower.

Presumably for this 'minimum security' solution you are proposing a common
Key shared by all wireless nodes.  In which case you will need a procedure
to allow frequent updating of the shared Key.

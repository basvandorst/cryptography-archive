: How about,
: sci.crypt.technical

I think "sci" and "technical" are redundant, but I suppose
"theory" and "research" have the same problem.  Remember that
sci.crypt will live on, and I would not want to suggest that
non-technical posts belong in sci.crypt.

From what I've read, people really want the moderated group to
cover the very topics sci.crypt is supposed to cover.  The
moderator is there to weed out off-subject or foolish posts.

The most descriptive name I can think of is "sci.crypt.moderated".

The following mechanism will provide general anonymity, unfortunately the
winner risks his response being identified (all others, however, remain
anonymous).

I cannot think of a mechanism that is completely anonymous that does not
rely at some point on a trusted individual.

  1.  Every member who wished to respond and be considered for the prize
      writes two (say) ten-digit numbers on the entry, picked by each member
      at random and kept secret by the member.

  2.  When the winner entry is picked, one of the ten-digit numbers
      is published.

  3.  For the winning member to claim his prize he must provide the other
      ten digit number.  Unless your membership is very large :-), the risk
      of collision with these numbers is relatively low.

Hmm, I'm surprised that such a rapid assessment can be made, given that I've 
put forth no algorithm.  Somehow, I feel that what you did is analogous to 
saying that RSA is easily broken because it uses a modulus, and Caesar 
Ciphers use a modulus, and everyone knows that Caesar ciphers can be solved 
by most people with a paper and pencil.  
I will definitely concede that my cryptanalytic and cryptographic experience 
is probably inferior to yours; however, I think that my algortihm may have 
merit because of a few very unconventional ideas in it.  I was not asking 
for an analysis, I was asking for advice as to whether or not it is a wise 
idea to post non-copyrighted algorithms publicly.  On a lighter note, I do 
appreciate you responding to my original post :)  On a more relevant note, 
you mentioned that one only need use a known or guessed plaintext attack 
until the original function is found.  Well, even after reconsidering my 
algorithm, I'm not sure that the entire algorithm can be modeled 
*mathematically*.  If it's a wise idea to post it, I will, and then I'll 
either get ripped up, praised, or ignored.  In any case, I'm sure I'll learn
something.

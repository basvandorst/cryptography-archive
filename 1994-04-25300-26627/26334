Hello,

I have a question that I am hoping someone can answer.  It is about DES 
keys and decryption.

I wrote a program to do DES.  I have a section of code that creates the 
16 keys from the original key.  These keys for encryption are stored in 
array K[17][].  

I am having a problem understanding what to do for decryption.  For 
decryption, can you just use the same keys, 1 through 16, that you used 
for encryption, but in reverse order?

Thanks,

Joe Wynn,

Given that wireless LANs "never" straddle national borders,
is it really important to have a standard crypto algorithm?
I think the _interface_ to the crypto algorithm should be
standard; but if a Swiss LAN uses a diffferent crypto algorithm
than the U.S. LAN it is connected to via a WAN, that's no skin
off anyone's nose.

I have been reading about clipper, and am wondering if I can get some

information.  I have heard that the Skipjack algorithm is hardware encoded
onto the chip rather then microcoded.  What is the difference between the
two ways?  I am very new to this news group, so I was also wondering
where Clipper stands now?  I haven't really heard anmything lately about
it.  I heard something a while back about AT&T using it or going to use
it, but I've heard nothing else.  Has it been built into any new products,
or set for introduction into products in the near future?  Thanks in
advance.

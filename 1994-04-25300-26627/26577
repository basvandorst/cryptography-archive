Planting tongue firmly in cheek:

Let's see--if we scale the above by a correction factor equal to the number
of years since the Scientific American Article that RSA-129 fell, divided by
the number of years the experts in the article thought it would take for it
to fall, what do we get?

Hm, hm, di-diddle, (I like to sing when I sew), dumty di....

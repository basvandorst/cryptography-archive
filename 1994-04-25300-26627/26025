   I suggest you look up "reductio ad absurdum" in the dictionary. This is not
   a mathematical seminar but a lay discussion group, and the technial usage
   you cite is a specialized meaning used in partcular technical disciplines
   and not even listed in my "Collegiate" dictionary.

   I would say that the method of assuming the contrary and showing it leads to
   a contradiction is only one form of reductio ad absurdum.

This does turn out to be true; I looked it up in an on-line dictionary
which verifies that this is a legitimate meaning.  So you are correct on
that point.

Nonetheless, I stand by my opinion that you drew an overbroad
generalization in your original example.  The original poster was not,
to the best of my knowledge, claiming that any restriction at all on
someone's behavior is harmful -- he was claiming that restrictions on
crypto export are harmful and serve no useful purpose, and you unfairly
generalized that to arms exports in general.

This is not the place to teach natural law. There are plenty of sources
available for that. Suffice it to say that the basis of any "moral claim"
arises out of natural law.

I'm not going to engage in a debate on this subject with those who are
making it up as they go along, and have never read or studied any of the
fundamental materials on this topic. Natural Law is the subject of extensive
work over the past several thousands of years, and about which there is much
teaching and source material in most good universities, from your choice of
the theological, law, or philosophy faculties.

Now I'm going to speak plainly for a few moments. I see a lot of messages
here from ill-educated, but bright people who know very little about what
they're talking about but feel free to sound off about matters well outside
their depth. I think this to be a consequence of the "rights society" in
which people act out of narcissistic self-interest with very little to
support their position beyond the law of the jungle. It is as if it were
legitimate for people to take "Og the cave-man" positions on an equal level
with what we've learned from 5000 years of civilization. I don't think it's
entirely the fault of those so sounding off--I think it's caused by a
defective educational system and irresponsible parenting. As a society we've
been seriously remiss on the moral education of the young. I commend Bill
Bennett's last three books to those interested in improving themselves in
this domain.

The ultimate expression of this narcissistic, sociopathological view is the
comment "If I think I have a moral right to something, I do, right?" Wrong.

End of plain speaking.

  I've seen references to NSA studies; they design and build a lot of "crypto
friendly" processors (surprise!).  Maybe look for pointers in Devours's books
on machine crypto?

  The question has been discussed in this group at least once; you should
check the archives.

  Fast associative table lookup and bit vector instructions (eg find the
leading/trailing one/zero in a string of bits) come to mind.

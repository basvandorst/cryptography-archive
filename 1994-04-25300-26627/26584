Two comments: one I made no prediction as to how many years it would
take, just how much computational resources it would take (i.e. MIPS-years).
Second, I am making the questionable assumption that the same
factoring algorithm continues to be used.  My points (and I did
get carried away) was that the original work estimate quoted for
a 1024 bit modulus was quite a bit low, and 1024 bits is not the
be-all end-all of security offered by RSA.

(I also wonder what disclaimers may have been in the old Sci Am article
that are being ignored, such as perhaps: "given current computers and
factoring algorithms", and a forgotten "on one computer".)

Readers should note that Grady Ward is attempting to take his campaign of
personal attack and name-calling to comp.org.cpsr.talk despite the requests
of several in that group that it not be permitted to degenerate to the same
playground hoodlumism that he and a few like-minded hooligans have created
in other newsgroups. Readers of cpsr newsgroups who wish to preserve a civil
and rational environment might want to consider kill-filing Grady. I've had
to do so in the other newsgroups, and I now regrettably do so for cpsr's
groups.

Readers will thux understand that I will not make any further responses to
Ward in cpsr groups. Silence in future does not denote assent to anything he
may have to post there. Readers who would like a civil atmosphere may wish
to censure Grady publicly. Social pressure seems to be the only remedy for
such behavior.

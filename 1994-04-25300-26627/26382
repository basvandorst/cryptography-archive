Or, to put it simply, newspapers publish lies every day.  Some of them
are labelled "rumours" and some of them are well-attested outright lies
from their news sources.  Politicians, criminals who are caught red-handed,
and a host of other miscreants are quited verbatim and "authoritatively"
on CNN every day.  I'm not sure which is less reliable; a rumour or some
self-serving statment from someone in authority.

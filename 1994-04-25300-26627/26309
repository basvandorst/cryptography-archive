In article <DRW.94Apr22195916@jordan.mit.edu> I wrote:

Oooh, that's embarrassing.  Even the best of us get it wrong
sometimes.

No, the problem isn't that if the algorithm is known, you can read
Clipper transmissions, it is that if the algorithm is known, people
can make un-escrowed but Clipper-compatible chips.

Although in that case, it's not so clear why it would matter if the
Russian intelligence service knows the algorithm.  *They* wouldn't use
Clipper chips (for fear of a back-door).  Perhaps they are looking for
export earnings, and would be willing to sell Clipper-compatibles for
less than real Clippers.

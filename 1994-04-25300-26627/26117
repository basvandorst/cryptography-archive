If you read the RSAREF licence, it requires that the distributor of an
Application Program using RSAREF get IN WRITING from each recipient
guarnatees that they will not use RSAREF (and thus the whole program)
commercially (as defined by the RSAREF licence, which is a bit looser than
some obvious definitions).

This is a pretty awkward burden for something that's supposed to be
available by FTP and so on.

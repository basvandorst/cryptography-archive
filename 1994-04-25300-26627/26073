I don't know of any software implementations, but there's pretty detailed
description of the machine's design in Deavours and Kruh's "Machine
Cryptography and Modern Cryptanalysis", pp. 226-245, including a number of
pictures.  The machine shouldn't be THAT hard to emulate in software.

Hope this helps,

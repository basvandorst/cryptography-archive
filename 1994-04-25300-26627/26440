I was just viewing the program "Beyond 2000" on the Discovery Channel...
they spoke of a new means by which to store and retrieve data via laser-printed
"strips" on paper.  Just a few strips of these could represent up to 12 pages of
type-written data and more... plus, it can be used to store encrypted data on
credit cards...

It can be reproduced on simple xerox machines, thus saving a bundle in media
charges for distribution... also it would afford easier portability between
various OS architectures... and read in via an optical scanner.  The only
specialized "equipment" would be specialized software to read and write
these new formats.

Anyone else hear of other similar workings?  Quite interesting.

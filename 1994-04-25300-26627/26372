It is the same problem as with distributing computer software licenses.
The system cannot be made secure.

A video or computer software vendor is giving the customer the cipher
text and and the keys to allow the customer to produce cleartext at the
customer's convenience and with the customer's hardware.  The vendor also
gives the customer new versions of the cipher text and either new keys or
expects the customer to use the old keys.  Under these circumstances,
there is in theory nothing to keep the customer from applying the keys to
the cipher text in ways the vendor would like to prohibit.  The problem
is the same, whether the vendor is worried about keeping the customer (or
the customer's customers) from running a program on 10,000 different PC's
or watching the same program on 10,000 TV's.  If the customer is willing
to expend enough effort and suffer the inconvenience, the customer can
duplicate system serial numbers, Ethernet addresses, IP addresses, or
Videocypher serial numbers.  Enough motivation of one kind or another
(potential profit or the thrill of it all) can make customers modify the
locking code in a "node locked" or "networked lisensed" program to fool
it into working anywhere, or to build custom hardware to use the latest
Videocypher scheme.

The vendor must ensure the cost to the customer of violating the license
is higher than the cost of buying a legitmate license.  Those costs can
include the engineering expenses to build hardware or software as well
as threats of lawsuits and even jail.

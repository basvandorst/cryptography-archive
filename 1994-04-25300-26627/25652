Nope.  PGP lets you choose the key length but the exponent is always
17 (ie. 5 bits).  RSAREF (and hence RIPEM) gives you a choice of two
exponents, 3 or 65537 (i.e. 3 bits or 17 bits).  10 years ago the
theory authorities were recommending using a RANDOM public exponent (not
just a large exponent) that was the same length as the modulus.
I don't remember what the reasoning was and don't know if the theory
behind it has changed since then.  Certainly it had little to do with
the possibility of the message being < the e^th root of the modulus,
where e is the public exponent.

This question has probably been asked a million times in this news group: Does 
anyone have the algorithm used by WordPerfect Office for the encryption of the 
mail files? I am interested in turning the files into ascii text and feeding 
them to a mail gateway program (which is not from WordPerfect).

Thank you for your time and effort.

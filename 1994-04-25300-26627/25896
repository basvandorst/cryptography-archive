I disagree in general.  Your phone conversations may be more private from
your neighbors, but encrypting them with Clipper will solve the
needle-in-haystack problem for people with resources who want to hear
your important conversations.  Clipper converts the conversation to a
digital format and adds a machine-identifiable LEAF to it, flagging this
conversation out of the millions in your area as something that somebody
thought was of considerable importance.

If your enemy has access to the escrow system (e.g. can suborn or hoodwink
one judge to get a legal wiretap), you are in more danger of losing your
privacy than you were with cleartext only, because you're telling them
which of your phone calls to bother looking at.

Someone will correct me (probably in a derisive tone :-) but I don't think
that this is a polynomial-time attack.  I posted a version of this PRNG
that uses 467 + 719 + 941 + 1129 = 3256 bytes of vector (instead of 2 + 3
+ 5 + 7 = 17 bytes).  So, to attack my version using Kelsey's method would
require on the order of 2**3259 ops and 2**3256 memory.

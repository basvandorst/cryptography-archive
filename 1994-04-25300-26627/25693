Hey Dan,

I think we've talked before:

I think one thing to note, is that even though Unix systems are more difficult
to "muck" with the kernel. Who says that the kernel needs to be mucked
for a virus to take effect?? Any root ran process has full system access
therefore allowing the ability of viruses to be implemented. 

From my experience with UNIX almost every manufacturer (except SGI, of course)
of UNIX boxes has blatant over-looked security holes. In a non-trusted
environment a smart hack could figure ways to make a virus spreadable
through a net. You want to really frusturate a work group, nail the NIS
server.

BTW,

I personally don't think there is such thing as a Virus-proof computer,
unless of course it's turned off.

My Opinions are my own.....

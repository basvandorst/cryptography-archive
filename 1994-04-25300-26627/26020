Apologies if this has been discussed-to-death already but I continue to
believe that debating Clipper in terms of privacy concerns is quite 
simply going to lose.  The tone in the country and, I suspect, case law,
seem to give the Clipper advocates a solid win, along those lines.

But that's ok.  Clipper loses on two other grounds that are not subject
to debate about social philosophy.  (Well, not subject *usually.)

The first is that the goal of Clipper is to permit government
access to communcations by 'the bad guys'.  However, alternate
technology is already and readily available which does NOT allow
law enforcement override and the bad guys can easily affort to buy
and use the technology.  I.e., the basic goal of the Clipper approach
is guaranteed to fail.

But even better is that it *will* mean that U.S. industry will have to
support two different technologies, one for the US government and one for
the rest of the market, i.e., the rest of the world.  This means that
U.S. industry will be at a competititve DISadvantage in the world
marketplace.

To some folks, these points are clear, obvious and old-hat.  Yet the
public discussions I'm seeing are not generally stressing them.  (Or
at least, not enough.  As I recall, Metcalfe stressed the latter in a NY 
Times Op Ed piece.)

Comments?

[? on export of "decryption" (cryptanalysis?)]

I wish the lawyers would comment on this.  At one time no place in ITAR
was cryptanalysis mentioned.  Perhaps that is still true.

So far as I know, only the State Dept's Technical Bulletin No. 80 claims
that "cryptography" also means cryptanalysis.  I do not believe that
a State Dept interpretation has the force of law.

It's pretty clear that cryptanalysis is not cryptography, even by the
NSA's own textbooks.  It's a point insisted on.  If the export law is
meant to cover cryptanalysis as well as cryptographic devices and software,
the ITAR should damn well say so.  But it doesn't (or at least didn't).

What say ye, lawyers? Is an obscure administration publication the law?

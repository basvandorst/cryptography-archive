Well, despite some criticism, I think that I *have* taken care of the 
plaintext patterns, and I'd like to post it for peer review.  If anyone 
thinks this is a bad idea, let me know.  Otherwise, I'll post it tomorrow 
afternoon.  Just to give a basic description of what I consider to be the 
algorithm's highlights, it includes a polymorphic key (I don't know if this 
idea has been addressed before) and the use of past plaintext as encryption 
*indices* not just as geometric variants.  Admittedly, the algorithm may not 
be the strongest ever seen, but I think it has some newer concepts worthy of 
discussion.  Thanks.

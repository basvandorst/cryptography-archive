   I think a good design principle for this kind of PRNG or LFSR is that,
while changing keys can be quite slow, if necessary, re-synchronization
should be something that can be accomplished fast.  This is because it's
possible for both sides of a stream communication to become hopelessly out
of synch, and to have to resynchronize.  Also, it might be useful to be
able to use the same key all day, with many others.  A fast re-synch would
help this....
 
   Any comment?

There's a new usegroup I surfed, nlnet.cryptografie.  In it are posts
concerning an attempt of the Dutch legislature to sneak in a law outlawing
free use of crypto in the Netherlands.  In effect crypto would be illegal
without registering one's keys with the authorities.  A newspaper there,
the Vokskrant has raised the alarm.

Egads!  The influence of the NSA!

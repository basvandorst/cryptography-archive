I guess  I see a difference.  I don't mind Microsoft posting that they are
looking for a full-time cryptographer, or Random House posting that they
are looking for a book author, or even the Dolphin people posting about
the cryptogrpahic algorithm in their products.  I think the community is
small enough that we should know about these things, even though they are
commercial.

I would start to object when we start seeing lots of commercial advertisements
with no cryptographic information in them.

It's impossible to completely seperate the commercial and non-commercial
worlds, and product announcements are certainly more interesting than the
endless Clipper debate.

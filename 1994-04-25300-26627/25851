Yes, but usually you install the software after booting the PC from a virus
free MS-DOS (you have locked it before) and assume that nothing else is in RAM.
So you ran only into trouble when you want to change something afterwards and
you have run programs which are not on locked sectors. You have always to take
care what you protect. That may be a bit complicated and annoying for the user.
(see your statement below).

>BTW, is this another PC-type controller thingy that doesn't work for SCSI disks?
Unfortunately it operates on a very low level and has the monitor the traffic
in order to detect head movements and read/write instructions. so you need
probably a special cart for each type of controller.

Obviously the system is only as good as its users.
We would have much less problems without these users.:-)

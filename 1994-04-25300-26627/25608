Must have been one of their erstwhile salesmen.  This company is no joke.
It is a 'multi-tiered' sales outfit, I think it's called.  If you are
dumb enough to become their salesman, you buy a bunch of their water
purifiers at an extravagant price.  You are supposed to turn around 
and find your own salesmen to buy them from you at an even more 
extravagant price.  And so on, ad infinitum.  Kind of a David Rhoades deal.

I have "downsized" friends whose careers at more honorable companies
left them totally unprepared for this kind of thing.  They have a
bunch of too-expensive water purifiers, and exhorbitantly priced
dried vegetable pills they would love to unload.  Beats me what the
vegetable pills are for.

So far as I can tell, NSA sales are mostly to their own salesmen.

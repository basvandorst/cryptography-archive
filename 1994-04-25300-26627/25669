Sorry, sci.crypt.

Send mail to qwerty@netcom.com with Subject "Bomb me!" for Gary Edstrom's
PGP FAQ and my "Here's How to MacPGP!" guides, both of which will help
anybody with PGP. They are also available by anonymous ftp from
ftp.netcom.com in /pub/gbe and /pub/qwerty. PGP is the free public key
encryption program designed by Phil Zimmermann.

Also in /pub/qwerty is the Crytography FAQ, US Crypto Policy FAQ and
other assorted goodies.

And if you aren't in the US, get PGP off a non-US ftp site. For a nice
list of ftp sites and legal tips, for all versions of PGP, send blank mail
to pgpinfo@mantis.co.uk.

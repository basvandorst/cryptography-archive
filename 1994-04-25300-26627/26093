Okay first of all, I admit I don't know too much about crytology, but it
seems to me that there must be a way to reverse so called one-way hash
functions, it's just that no one has figured it out yet.  Or have they?
With DES encryption, the security problem seems to be concerned with the
length of keys, and cracking speed of fast computers, so you don't expect
too many surprises coming up like someone finding a unique way to crack it.
But with the hash functions, while increasing processing speed is surely
a threat, couldn't someone also come up with a way to reverse the hash 
codes (or whatever they're called)?  Maybe all salts would have to be tried
but that's a lot less time that all possible passwords.  Any comments?

Firewood?  If it's on 8mm tape, you could erase it and record the late
movie in your VCR.... :-)

   As soon as you re-use any of it, you're in a state of sin.  The probability
   of a cryptanalyst breaking it has gone from bugger-all to something higher.

If you *must* do something like this, in case your courier was shot or whatever,
it makes much more sense to use the pad by encrypting it in CBC mode
using a shared secret key and some algorithm like IDEA or triple-DES.
This has several advantages 

- even if the courier sells copies of the pad to the Yankees,
they still need to know the key and starting point to use it easily.

- if you *do* use the same part of the pad twice, but different
starting points or different encryption keys (do both),
at least you don't output the same characters both times.

- and if your pad is on writable magnetic material (unlike CDROM),
overwrite the starting point with junk after using it,
to further decrease the chances of re-use.

At least in theory, I think it's also possible to speculate about a distributed
cryptographic attack by people *not willing* to do this, e.g. by hiding
the algorithm inside an operating system or application program and stealing
CPU cycles from the user ("parasitic cryptanalysis", if you like).

Feedback of results to the author of the program could be established thru e-mail
or "maintenance messages" ("malfunction, send this number ... to ...". Even
better: "You broke the hi-score and won 100 $!! call ... ").

P.S.: This should be great stuff for conspiracy fans: Imagine: "Tetris wasn't a 
game at all, it was a distributed factoring program by the KGB" ;----)

iPower is NSI's response to the Tessera specification. In that role, it 
would be equipped with Capstone/Skipjack. However, the company says it 
plans to provide versions set up for the algorithm of the user's choice:
RSA, DES, triple-DES, etc. If you want more details, e-mail me. I have 
NSI's product announcement in the office.

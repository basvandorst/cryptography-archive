1.  Don't try to do this over the phone.  Microsoft can't respond to that kind
of request by presuming you're a honest person -- that'd be silly of them.

2.  Obtain a copy of the death certificate (certified, official, and about $5).
 Mail that, along with a record of the individual's employment, to Microsoft
and ask them to respond.  Offer, if they're afraid of the method creeping out,
to send /them/ the file and let /them/ decrypt it.

3.  If they respond negatively and you're /sure/ that they really have the
ability to comply, get the lawyer who is running the will through probate to
write a letter on your behalf, summarizing the situation.  A supporting letter
from one of the kinfolk might help for this, also.

4.  Fergit it.  If that doesn't work, you probably can't do anything.  You
certainly can't /make/ Microsoft perform a service they never offered to do and
have told everybody they can not or will not do.

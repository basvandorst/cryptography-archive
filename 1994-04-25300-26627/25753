Exercise for the reader: emulate a Von Neuman-architecture machine on a
Harvard-architecture machine of slightly larger size, and thereby prove that
Harvard-architecture machines may be susceptible to viruses.  (Or think of it
the other way around: a Harvard-architecture machine is just a Von Neuman-
architecture machine with the hardware replaced by a "program space".)

All that code is is instructions for a machine to do something.  The "memory
space" can be considered to be code run by the programs in the "program space",
so essentially you can have self-modifying code.

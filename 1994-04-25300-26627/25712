If we are to use a door analogy, escrow is a door to your house to which
only the government has a key and which only the government may open.
Most folks would not think of such a door as a "front door".  A "back
door" seems more descriptive to the general public.  

I realize crypto folks have traditionally placed a slightly different meaning
to "back door", but the report was not to crypto folks.

These statements bothered me too...but maybe we are too close to the
details.  But I suspect Clipper is as secure as RSA/IDEA (ignoring the
'back door' for the moment)

Given the mugging of AT&T via ITARs, I would hardly call Clipper voluntary :(

Wasn't the Clipper announcement made with a statment from the White House
that we had 'no constitutional right' to non-Clipper crypto?

One could hardly call the report fair if it did not include something
from the hundreds of thousands of us who would make such assertions :)

David, a lot of them are opposed to Clipper too!  The only company that is
fully behind it, I bet, is the chip fabrication house that people, including
former NSA employees(!), have set up in CA.

When did this law pass?

I heard the same thing from the FBI when NCIC was set up. The abuses of that
system and lack of prosecution of the abusers are well documented.

All it takes to get a Clipper 'back door' key is a fax from the chief
prosecutor of any legal subdivision of any state saying 'sure, we have a court
order' ... I would say this limits keys to only tens of thousands of
jurisdictions and, potentially, hundreds of thousands of people.  

Of course, there are no "rogue law enforcement people" in that population. 
How do I know?, you ask.  Well, I asked all rogue law enforcement people
to e-mail me if they intended to abuse the Clipper key escrow system and none
did.

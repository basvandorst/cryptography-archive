This is wrong and like saying that all poetry must have rhyme or meter.
 
Rights can come from many different sources, some written, some political,
some based on humanism or even simple physical laws. To be granted those
rights by others, though, one must persuade them of the validity of
those rights.  Now we get into politics, polemics, and other forms of
human social jockeying, only some of which involves the law.
Reducing rights only to what is recognized by our Constitution and our
elected representatives is as limited as believing that the Prussian
state of Hegel's day was the pinnacle of human systems of governance. 



: for in the social contract--namely lobbying Congress to get them to act to
: remove or modify those authorities the administration now has. An attempt to
: reject or overthrow the social contract based on the issues we're discussing
: would be uh, er, umm, unrealistic.

This paragraph is wrong and calculated to serve the interests of the
bureacracy at the expense of the individual. Clearly the dissemination of
PGP worldwide expresses some universal belief that strong privacy is a
fundamental human right whether or not recognized by any official body.

   Ugh.  I wasn't real clear.  What I was trying to get across was that:
 
1.  According to every source we've heard from, the algorithm was designed so
    that its security didn't rest in the secrecy of the algorithm.
 
2.  That doens't mean that no attacks exist.  As we've recently heard from
    NIST about an impending SHA redesign, the NSA is quite capable of making
    mistakes and putting out weak crypto schemes.  More people seeing the
    algorithm means more possibilities of *someone* finding an attack that,
    as yet, is unknown (a flaw in design) or being hidden (a trapdoor).

   Actually, I'm concerned about all kinds of attacks, including chosen-
plaintext, chosen-ciphertext, related-key, etc.  Even attacks that seem
terribly impractical can wind up allowing attacks on systems based on the
cipher, or can lead to other weaknesses in the actual cipher.
 
   I have no interest in trusting a secret algorithm, whether Skipjack
or RC4 or something else.  And I have no interest in using a key-escrow
system.

   An 80-bit keysearch *may* be infeasible now.  It's quite hard to predict
what will be possible in 10 years, or what may be possible *if* there is some
feature of the algorithm that makes it easier to do an exhaustive keysearch.
Think of my earlier post on weak-keys in variable-s-box ciphers--In REDOC III,
a skew in certain bit positions of your key table would be obvious with a
small amount of known plaintext--this could probably speed up a keysearch a
bit, though not by all that much in most cases.  It's certainly possible to
build a cipher so that keysearch can be optimized somehow.  This is certainly
one way to build in a trapdoor, especially if you intend to have several
hundred times the computing power of most other people in the forseeable
future.

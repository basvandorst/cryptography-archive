I used to notice that back in my GEnie days, but I always attributed it to
the officially-supported Aladdin front-end program, and not GEnie itself.
I'd always wondered why PGP, UUDECODE, etc. didn't just ignore any leading
spaces, assuming the rest of the line was correct.  Also, GEnie's mailer
didn't like messages that had lines beginning with certain characters, like
".", I think.

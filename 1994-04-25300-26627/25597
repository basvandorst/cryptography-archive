Well, may be I'm awfully wrong, but in the Moscow University there was
a special "Department of Structural Linguistics" (or something like
this) which was rumoured to be a KGB crypto-college. I remember (from
the time I was studying for the admission exams) that their math tests
were as hard as the ones for Math, Physics departments. I can guess
from this that the quality of students was the same.

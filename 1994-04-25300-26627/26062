I hate to rain on your parade Michael, but software encryption is no  
stronger than the operating system that your program resides on.  UNIX has  
notoriously weak security.  Hardware encryption, at least if used  
properly, adds a layer between your system and the outside world that must  
be bypassed before damage can be done.

In any case "Clipper" is a voice encryption chip.  To do voice encryption  
in software requires considerable processing power.  This means a high  
horsepower machine, since non-real-time voice encryption doesn't make  
sense.  We're talking money here, more than the cost of Clipper.  If you  
happen to have a machine with a powerful Floating Point DSP, A/D, and D/A  
converters sitting on your desk your idea might work, but it won't be  
cheap.

Stick to journalism Mike.  It's not wrong to voice your concerns, but it's  
counterproductive to offer solutions when you don't understand the entire  
problem.

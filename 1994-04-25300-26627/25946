It really bugs me when companies issue dollar reward challenges, and
when no one no one claims it, touts this as evidence of the
algorithm's security.

Who wants to put in hundreds or thousands of hours of work to crack a
code for a thousand or a few hundred dollars? Bleah. Anyone that can
do that can do a *lot* better by getting a security manager job.

Now if someone posts a reward of 10 MILLION dollars, there's some real
incentive to crack it. Of course if it's really secure, anyone can
make this offer, because it will never ever be broken :).

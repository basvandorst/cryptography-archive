Look at the licence agreement.

RSAREF is only licenced for use by the _published_ RSAREF interface. 
The problem is that you can't implement PGP based on this interface
(the use of IDEA as the symmetric cipher is one of the problems here
as the published interface only supports DES, DESX and Triple DES).

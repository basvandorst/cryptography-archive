If publicly registering a crypto key is anything like registering a
firearm in pre-Nazi Germany, then maybe there IS something to worry about.
The same drivel that passes for "logic" -- "guns are only made for killing
people" could also be applied to crypto as well: "if you have no evil to
hide, why encrypt your correspondence".  If crypto should ever become
illegal, or stringently controlled, a key server would yield "Big Brother"
with a nice list of "the usual suspects", wouldn't it? 

BTW, how does registering a key on a server prove that it's you who
registered it, and not someone else?

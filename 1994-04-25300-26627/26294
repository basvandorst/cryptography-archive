I'm not sure if you're addressing me, but I would hazzard a pretty good
guess that, yes, your testing is probably flawed in some sense.

I assume you got your "random" numbers from some sort of "random number
generator".  This is, of course, an algorithmic process and there are
several kinds of "randomness".  The method you are using may be random
in one sense, but not in a different one and it may be the "other kind"
that, by chance, the compression is exploiting.  To give a trivial case,
suppose I had a file full of perfectly "random" 16 bit integers, but
represented them as 32 bit words.  A character-based compression would find 
plenty to do.  But, there are lots of less obvious variants of this that
are artifacts of the algorithms (your generator and your compressor), not
just from your choice of representation.

Read Knuth, "Seminumerical Algorithms" for more; "randomness" is not a topic
I can compress into a short Internet note :-).

How about finding 6 fellows (ask in the linux-groups) which are willing to
pay the price if you do the porting. I am quite sure some people there 
would be interested in a legal Viacrypt Version of PGP. Let them pay the 5
licenses, you just;-) do the work. If it weren't for the fact that I am 
outside of the USA I would gladly cooperate with you!
I wish you luck,

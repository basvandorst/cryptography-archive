I left that out because I thought it was obvious, but
you're the second person who's acked so I guess
it isn't.

The bonafide recipient would need to be in possession
of both the 56-bit DES key and the 64-bit intial state
vector in order to decrypt.

Since DES is a private key system, a secret means for
providing the DES key to the recipeint is assumed.
The 64 bits of initial state would be provided by the
same means as the 56 bit DES key -- whatever those
means are.  In effect, the key is all 120 bits.

I wish to encrypt streams of digital data that represent sounds and videos,
and It seems the tradeoffs involved will be quite different compared to
encrypting text and still images. Some of the variables I'm working with
are:
 
-minimizing encrypt time
-if an algorithm is crackable for text, is it worthless for video?
-minimizing playback latency due to initializing the decryption
-maximum real-time playback data rate vs. complexity of key/algorithm
-maximum real-time playback data rate vs. cost of the compute engine
-minimizing the storage requirements of the receive hardware
-network costs/benefits vs. using locked containers over FedEx.
-thwarting all those who wish to copy the data for about the next 50 years,
thus, what computing power will be available in 2044 for, say $1000 in 1994
dollars? $1B in 1994 dollars?

Of course, a person at a receiving site can simply point an analog camera
and microphone at the screen and speaker. Thus, another--possibly
absurd--desire is to discover a way to make it difficult for persons to
produce a viable digital master from the analog movie image, while
preserving high-quality playback. 

I wonder if anyone has citations that will help me sort out these issues,
and identify other relevant issues. I've seen little traffic on this
newsgroup on streaming data types, and will be pleased to post a digest of
responses.

Agreed.

Unless the limiting Factor is Cost per Byte, I assume?

That requires that they will be able to look up the Tapes to playback based
on who they want to listen to, i.e., a Person-to-Phonecall Directory.
Currently, there is no easy Way to find out the Identity of both Participants
of a Phone Call (assuming that you may use Phone Booths, Hotel Phones, etc.);
Clipper *might* provide one, if you insist on not trusting any Clipperphone
you don't own ...

That's pretty bad in itself, but the Point I wanted to make is that there's
no Possibility (now) to do the even worse Scanning of all Calls. Voice Recog-
nition just isn't so far yet (but might pretty well be this Century ...)

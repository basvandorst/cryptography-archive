Aren't you talking about the ExVira card, produced by Bugivics, by any
chance? I know the author; he visited our VTC and explined us the
design. It's a very good design; I could come up only with two ways to
design a virus for such a computer. However, we never got an
evaluation copy of the product, so I don't know whether there are any
impementation errors in the design. In particular, I know at least one
person who claims to have succeeded to bypass the protection by using
a special TSR program, about 3 Kb long. According to him, the trick
was based on the fact that the computer on the card (it's a whole
computer, with a RAM, ROM, attached to the keyboard and the hard disk)
keeps part of its programs in the address space of the main computer.
It wasn't so according to the design that was presented to us; I also
came up with this attack and specifically asked the author whether it
is so. He said 'no'. Go figure.

IMHO, this is a rumor that was spread by the producer of the card. It
has been explicitely denied by IBM. Meanwhile, the producer has sold
his company. His latest hit is some chip to decrypt encrypted CD-ROMs
or some other nonsense like that.

Then again, nothing in natural law guarantees a government the right to
govern over me.  Government results from a soft altruism (social
contract, or right), which essentially boils down to _I won't try to
kill you if you don't try to force me to bend to your will_. 
Fundamentally, in nature, there is only the contest between a given
entity and the universe.  Government is simply a means of narrowing the
scope of this contest.  Instead of me against everything, it is me and
you against everything except each other (in the idealized state).
etc...

"Public domain", as explicitly defined in the ITAR, is
unrelated to "public domain" as defined in intellectual
property law.  If PGP pere printed in a book, it would (to the
extent that the ITAR is clear on anything) clearly fall under
the ITAR definition of public domain.  That it is distributed
as machine readable code makes it much muddier.  (I know, it
doesn't make any sense.)

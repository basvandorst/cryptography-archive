I posted this request to rec.arts.tv and someone replied via email
to suggesting I post to this group:

Does anyone know the format of the VCR+ coding scheme?  For example
if I do not have a TVGuide and I want to record a show starting
on a given Friday at 8:00 PM running for 2 hours what "magic number"
do I enter?

I would also like to be able to decode a VCR+ listing.

Hope this group can help as rec.arts.tv has been pretty silent,

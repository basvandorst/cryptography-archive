Why would one encrypt a publicly distributed newsletter?  OTOH, if someone
were conducting a "sting" to compile a list of crypto users, PGP "patent
violators, etc. this would be a good way to do it, wouldn't it?

I'm not saying that's what Ben Rockwood is trying to do.  His
motives may be quite harmless.  But even so, monitoring his outgoing mail
would accomplish the same thing for anyone so inclined.  I'm told that
some cable operators did something similar to catch people wih illegal
decoder boxes, which were "too good" at unscrambling the signal.  In the
middle of a pay-per-view event, they put on a "commercial" offering a free
t-shirt and an 800 number to call.  They did it in such a way that it
remained scrambled for people with legitimate boxes.  They compiled a list
of people who called their 800 number, including the number they had called 
from, thanks to ANI (automatic number identification) available to WATS
customers, and ultimately busted a few "cable pirates".

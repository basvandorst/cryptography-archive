"Known Plaintext Attack"

Start with some known or easily guessable part of the message.  Headers,
.sig files, addresses, etc.  Set the codebreaking machine to look only at
a single block in the known part of the message.  Try a lot of keys.  When
you find one that gives you the right (known) plaintext on that block,
you can decrypt the rest of the message using the same key.

Better still is the "Chosen Plaintext Attack", where the codebreaker
convinces the codebreakee to encrypt a message fragment of his choice,
for which he has already done much of the preliminary work.  

DES is actually quite secure if the attacker has no clue about what the
plaintext looks like.  But this will never be the case with a competent
attacker.  Good cryptosystems must be secure against known/chosen plaintext
attacks.

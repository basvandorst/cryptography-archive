Depends how much integrity checking your decompresser has.   Inbetween
the header information and checksums, I think any bit vector at all is
valid input to gzip, because it encodes the various codes it uses with
Huffman compression, and any code in the Huffman tree is a valid one. 
Just choose your plaintext and uncompress it!

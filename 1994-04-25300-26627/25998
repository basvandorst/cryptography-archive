Problem is, you don't normally boot in this way, do you? Granted, when
you suspect a virus infection, you can easily "boot clean" - much
easier than on a PC. This helps a lot - but it doesn't solve the
problem.

Suppose you have been indeed infected, have noticed it, and have
booted clean. Now what? You have to identify all infected objects and
either disinfect them or replace them with clean originals - otherwise
you are doomed to do the special booting till the end of your days and
to never execute an application that might have been infected.

OK, so how do you detect the infected objects? The most convenient way
is to use a scanner. Tough luck, according to what I've read, the
first polymorphic virus for Acorn Archimedes has already appeared.
It's called Dratsab or something like that. According to the
description, it's polymorphic engine is rather lame, but just wait
until the wimps who write viruses for this platform discover the
beauty of the technology used in such heavily polymorphic engines as
MtE, TPE, NED, and many others, currently available on the PC...

A more secure way to deal with the problem is to use an integrity
checker. Are there good ones for the Acorn?

   Yes, but a question. Does this final crunch have to run to completion
   before there is any possibility of a final answer, or could at any point
   the result pop out? Obviously if it did pop up, verification is trivial.

The answer is yes, but that's not very helpful.  After we have
processed abouut (N-10) of the relations, the chance of us getting the
answer gets significant.  Here N is the size of the factor base
(524388 for RSA-129).  By the time we have processed N+10 we are
virtually certain of the answer.  Both these numbers are so close to N
that the distinction is unimportant.

I only scanned through your posting (quite a long Usenet posting... don't
you have a job??  :-) ), but what I saw seemed similar to the following
reference --- if it's not the same, I think you would still find the
following paper interesting (as well as the references that it contains):

M. Mnuk.  "A div(n) depth boolean circuit for smooth modular inverse", 
Information Processing Letters, Vol. 38, No. 3, May 17 1991, p. 153ff.

A "smooth modular inverse" is one in which all prime factors of the
modulus are "small", which is what you were looking at, I think.

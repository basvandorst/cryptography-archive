(1) I do not know whether Mr. Schneier was misquoted, but if the above
quote is accurate, then the asymptotic estimate he gave was wrong.

The time complexity function should be:

exp(  (c + o(1)) (log N)^1/3 (loglog N)^2/3)

For the special number field sieve, c is about 1.5. Forthe general version
c is about 1.92. And noone has published any estimates as to how fast
o(1) goes to zero, or what its value is for numbers that have been factored.

Any extrapolations based on this function would have to be viewed very
skeptically.

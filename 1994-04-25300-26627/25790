Silence does not constitute assent, and we all have the right not to reply
to posts we think boring, uninteresting, prolix, poorly expressed, or wrong
enough on their face not to require intervention. This is not a courtroom,
and there is no "invisible judge". It's a discussion group.

For those who like to play the game of "having the last word", I give you a
certificate here and now that you've had the last word. Now relax. Since
you've got my certificate, you don't actually have to reach into the further
regions of illogic or the slightly relevant to actually get the last post.

That's right--each reader, when he's bored or tired of something may simply
fail to respond, which means not that he's conceded the point of the latest
post of another, but rather that he's content to rely on what he's already
said, and feels the latest post of the other doesn't significantly alter the
basic issues.

In cases where the "other" has successfully dealt with a point, third
parties are presumed smart enough to tell the difference between this and a
message that doesn't so deal (if they care). Since it's not a trial,
"claiming victory" becomes irrelevant.

There is no victory in civilized discussion--just increased learning and
insight. One doesn't need to keep score to get that.

You are correct. This is why many folks building systems on the x86
architecture do not use the PC-compatible BIOS if they are concerned about
viruses.

Having executable code that is writable by someone other than the owner of the
executable file is something that doesn't make sense, anyway. User guideance
regarding the setting of discretionary permissions, in the lack of strong
itegrity controls, should direct that executables be writable only by their
owners (e.g., in unix parlance rwx--x--x)

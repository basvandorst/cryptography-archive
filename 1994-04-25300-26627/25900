You missed the point of his arguement. Clipper *IS* useful against the people 
who like to 'listen in' on telephone conversations etc... If your enemy has 
access to a gullible judge, you are screwed whether it's cleartext, or 
Clipper encrypted.

His third point, which you have not touched, really makes this all irrelevant
anyway. As long as we can continue to use other viable forms of encryption, 
this will not be a problem.

I have heard the many market's theory, but this has problems. If you argue 
that Clipper will become the standard, and other systems just won't get 
market share, than there will be so much clipper traffic, the needle-in 
the-haystack arguement doesn't really fly.

Then, of course, there is the bugging arguement. If you really have enemies 
with access to a judge, they could easily bug your house, at least getting 
one side of the conversation....

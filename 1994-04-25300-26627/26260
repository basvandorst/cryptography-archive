This is one of the few cases where key escrow would be a good idea (as
opposed to the Clipper proposal).  It would be useful for companies to
have an encryption package that (for example), encrypted a file and
then sent (perhaps by email protected by public key) a set of escrow
keys to two separate places.  Then if the employee quits, or dies, or
falls into a coma, the data can be recovered.

This would be especially useful when combined with email.  The traditional
'solution', (use weak encryption such as "crypt") fails very badly in the
email case.  The strong encryption solution will fail if no one can cover
your job if you cannot.  With key escrow, you could use the strongest
methods for the portion of the transfer most likely to be intercepted.

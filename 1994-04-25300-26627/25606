: See Mike's README.MPJ for the conditions to be observed and to learn ???????.

To repeat.  The name of the directory is NOT /crypto_????????.  Those ?s
are wild cards.  You have to replace them with the right characters.

Mike's README.MPJ gives you those characters.  README.MPJ is located
in /mpj.

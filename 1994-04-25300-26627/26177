Hang on, no compression system can be asymptotically optimal over all
forms of redundancy.  A string encoding successive values of the Busy
Beaver function is in some sense infinitely redundant, but I doubt that
Lempel-Ziv's compression of it tends to infinitely good.  In practical
terms, I doubt that its compression of the expansion of \pi has this
property either.

I think your proof (which you said you didn't understand) can only refer
to specific forms of redundancy.

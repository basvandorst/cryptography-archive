An important way to fight Clipper is to provide alternatives.

So, we need VHDL, etc. implementations of DES, IDEA, ... publically
available in the same way as the various software implementations:
network access.

This will perhaps prevent some projects from including Clipper
by default, simply because it is the least expensive hardware
implementation of reasonable crypto.

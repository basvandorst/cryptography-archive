   AT&T was not mugged. They were told that if they produced the scramble phone
   they intended, it would give the government an intelligence problem such
   that it would violate the rules concerning exports and they would not be
   given an export license for it. They could still make and sell it here
   without problems.  They were also told that since Clipper was escrowed, it
   did not give the government an intelligence problem if exported, and thus
   would have no trouble getting an export license. It was then left to them,
   and they decided to use Clipper in order to get the bigger market.

David, please demonstrate that they were told this, and only this, or
please use the word "hypothesis" when describing who told whom what.  I
do not believe that you have "hard facts" (your words) on this matter,
but if I'm wrong I would be happy to be corrected.

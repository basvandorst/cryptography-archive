   Compromise of the Skipjack algorithm wouldn't make it possible to
read Skipjack-encrypted ciphertext, according to anyone who's seen the
algorithm.  That's not why the algorithm is classified.
 
   Compromise of the algorithm would simply mean
 
1.  That it was possible to build Clipper-compatible phones and such without
    key escrow.
 
2.  That the public crypto community could scrutinize Skipjack for potential
    undiscovered weaknesses, trapdoors (unlikely, in my opinion), and for
    the design principles used to build the algorithm.
 
3.  That there would be more people able to work on an analysis of the
    encryption algorithm, thus making it more likely that weaknesses in
    the algorithm would be found.
 
4.  That it would be easier to do brute-force attacks against the 80-bit
    key, by building special-purpose Skipjack keysearch machines.  Note
    that the LEAF mechanism makes Clipper devices especially vulnerable to
    keysearch--only one keysearch is needed to determine the escrow key,
    if the family key is somehow known.  Otherwise, two keysearches are
    needed.

   Can anyone tell me where I can find details of *how* the SHA was broken?
From the redesign, we may be able to tell whether it was a problem with some
peripheral part of the algorithm (ie, the message expansion), or with the
basic operations of the compression function.
 
   It disturbs me a bit that all the most common hashing schemes are
based on the same basic thing--32-bit addition with rotation and some
simple binary mixing functions that originated with stream cipher design.
What if the NSA found a general way to attack that kind of hash function?
(What if someone less inclined to keep their mouths shut about it did?)

I'm interested in how Caller ID works.  I recently purchased a
Caller ID Unit from Southwestern Bell, and have found out that the
phone company sends out some sort of phone pulse between first and
second phone rings.  I am now interested in building such a contraption
for the PC, but I need data on how this pulse is made, how to decrypt
it, how to find it, etc.  If anyone has any information
about Caller ID, please don't hesitate to email me.  Also let me know
if such a PC device already exists..

Thanks for your time..

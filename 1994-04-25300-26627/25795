And it has a wonderful system whereby updates and supplements to the OS
are easily (and automatically) loaded into memory, replacing resident
portions of the OS.

There are over 50 known and documented viruses for the Archimedes, and
they work in very similar ways to viruses for IBM PCs, MS-DOS, AmigaDOS,
Apple Mac, Atari TOS, MS-Windows, ...

Better, the Archimedes has a magical "!BOOT" (pronounced; pling-boot)
file - if present on a floppy disk it is run automatically when the disk
is placed in the drive.  On most other microcomputers an 'infected' file
must be run by the user, on the Arc the OS does it for you!

There is a ASCII document describing most of them on the antivirus ftp area
I manage;  ftp.demon.co.uk:/pub/antivirus/archimedes/avrd184t


No offence intended to the Arc and its users.  However, just because I've
never used one don't presume I'm ignorant about them.

Being a Pearl Harbor afficionado from my high school days, the problem wasn't
timely decoding of PURPLE, the U.S. government had all parts of the communique
decoded before the Japanese in Washington DC.  Rather, there was no system
of checks and balances to insure that those in charge in Hawaii were in on
intel.  Notification that attack may be imminent went by regular precedence
telegram.  There were also two notifications that the Japanese might be
planning an attack on one of several locations (including Hawaii) in the 
preceding month.  Note the carriers were not in port that Sunday morning.
The rest of the fleet would have been out, more than likely except for
fuel oil allocations.  The U.S. knew of a plan to bomb Pearl Harbor early
in November from a walkin to a U.S. consulate.

Saddams military made extensive use of fiberoptic landlines.  We got better
Humint than Comint.  Seems that a large part of our helping the enemy of our
enemy (Iran) was providing intelligence, and oh, by the way, allowing the
Iraqis to assess our gathering capability.  Supposedly they had lots of extra
revetments for aircraft and tanks.  The U.S. wasted a lot of smart bombs with
no secondary explosions.  Gee, one wonders if that Baby Milk factory was
indeed producing nerve gas?

As far as with respect to thwarting terrorist plots, there is simply not
enough capacity to monitor all communications crossing this countries 
boundaries, much less in the rest of the world.  Communications intercepts
are targetted, much as law enforcement does with wire taps, and still a
large portion of the intercepts are destroyed without being evaluated.
Its not like there was a unit ID on your phone...

Lives can and have been lost by the inability to read prescription drug labels.

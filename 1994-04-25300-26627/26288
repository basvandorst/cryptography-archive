This is the only valid reason, IMHO, for keeping Clipper secret.  And this 
reason is valid only if you believe that there are legitimate reasons for law
enforcement to tap into private communications.

First, you say that knowledge of Skipjack wouldn't compromise the security of
Skipjack-encrypted data, and cite as a reference a group of people who are 
sworn to secrecy on the matter.  

THEN, you say that if Skipjack IS exposed to scrutiny, weaknesses might be 
found.



Which is it?

Of course you don't know.  The NSA is saying "trust us."

If Skipjack suffers from this weakness (that it cannot withstand a chosen-
plaintext attack), then I don't want it to be the only thing protecting MY
communications.

A brute-force attack on an 80-bit key?  

Whatever you are smoking, it's probably illegal (and bad for your health, too.)

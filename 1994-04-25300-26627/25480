There has been some serious discussion on this point, and I have not found
any consensus answer.  Merkle used variable, key-dependent S-boxes in
Khufu (which is where I stole the idea).  Khufu seems to be resistant to
both differential and linear cryptanalysis.

Yes.  This is what a stream cipher is.

Interesting idea.  My feeling, though, is that a block cipher should stand
on its own and not be required to be used in any stream mode.

	Well, my computer's a 66MHz machine, so I'll be conservative
and say it can do 15 megaflops.
	2^80 = 2^(10*8) = 1000^8 =10^24 different 80-bit words
	15*10^6 = 1.5*10^7 words per second
	
	So we're talking about 7*10^16 seconds. There are about
five million seconds in a day, so we're looking at 1.4*10^10 days.

	So it's not feasable on a single PC. Of course, I don't know
how *fast* these processors can get, so it might be possible to take
some massively parallel machine with super-fast chips I  would
know little about simply due to my inexperience, and find this password
in a few years.

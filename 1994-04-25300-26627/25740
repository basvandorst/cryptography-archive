Not just crypto folks. "Back door" has been a term of art in the computer
field generally for many years. It has a specific (and often pejoratively
shaded) meaning. By using it in the way he did Phil was engaging in simple
propaganda.

No. Either he's incompetent, making up facts, engaging in sloppy journalism,
or has been told a Top Secret by the NSA and is passing it on. There's no
innocuous explanation for those usages.

AT&T was not mugged. They were told that if they produced the scramble phone
they intended, it would give the government an intelligence problem such
that it would violate the rules concerning exports and they would not be
given an export license for it. They could still make and sell it here
without problems.  They were also told that since Clipper was escrowed, it
did not give the government an intelligence problem if exported, and thus
would have no trouble getting an export license. It was then left to them,
and they decided to use Clipper in order to get the bigger market.

These licensing principles existed long before Clipper, and were being
applied consistently with past rulings by the government. Hardly a mugging.

No. They said, as near as I can recall, that there was no Constitutional
right to crypto.  I take that as a statement about the Constitution, not
about their intentions. I leave arguing it to experienced Constitutional
lawyers certified to practice before the Supreme Court, because it's the
sort of thing on which "everyone has an opinion" but most people (including
myself) aren't really competent to discuss as a legal question.

That wasn't my objection. It was that there was no directly counterbalancing
material, and Phil is quite aware of such material. He's told me he's
followed the .net discussion on the matter.

I disagree. When I was Chief Economist of a Fortune 50 company I would have
taken the Clipper deal in a second. Same when I was designing fleets of
ships in another company, in a competitive environment with the prize being
a billion dollar contract each time. We WERE subjected to the kind of
industrial espionage Clipper might have prevented but other crypto systems
might not. Fortunately, the bad guys got caught and the damage was
contained. I mention this not as a comment on myself, but to suggest that I
think that your "the only company" remark is inaccurate.

By the way, for those who don't understand why I have the position on
Clipper I do, since some have smoked out what they call my "liberal
credentials", it's because of experiences such as the above, and similar
ones.

Beats me. Maybe they did it administratively by using existing national
security laws. Someone who is interested should ask, since yet another
speculative thread on this won't get us anywhere.

I believe that remark to be speculation on your part. I've never seen such a
thing stated officially.

I wouldn't go to town with this until you have some hard facts.

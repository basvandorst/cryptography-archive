You are, of course, free to give up any of YOUR privacy that
you choose to. I consider my privacy to be an inalienable right,
with the only question being the limits to those rights.

If you do not see any moral issues in privacy,
perhaps you are unaware of the Supreme Court decision holding
that Alabama had a 'legitimate' public interest in what homosexuals
do in the privacy of their own homes.  Curiously, this public
interest was not held to extend to heterosexuals.

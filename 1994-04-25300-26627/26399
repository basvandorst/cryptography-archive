Jim Ebright kindly reposted Richard Wendland's message about Bletchley
Park.  The exhibition by The Bletchley Park Trust is well worth seeing
and deserves more attention.

A few weeks ago I organised a trip to Bletchley Park for attendees of
our security protocols workshop.  The people there were very helpful,
especially Tony Sale who kindly demonstrated equipment not on display
to the public, and patiently answered those questions that he is
allowed to.

Tony is rebuilding the Colossus key testing machine.  He told us that
the machine itself is now de-classified but the algorithms to make use
of it are still officially secret.  Where possible he is following the
original plans but some of his measurements could only be made from
photographs of the original machine.

In addition to the field equipment such as Enigma that many of you will
know from published papers there is a captured Geheimschreibe (sp?) that
was used for high-grade traffic.  It is also interesting to contrast US
and German equipment of the same period.

I should also like to take this opportunity to thank publicly Sir Harry
Hinsley, who worked with Alan Turing at Bletchley Park, for taking the
time to speak at our workshop.  There is much still to be published about
the work that was carried out there.

An even more interesting question:

	What would be a good way to estimate the _value_ of such kinds
of information?  How could one hack out a method or technique for the
comparison of various kinds of information - e.g. someone's credit
history or SSN being counted as less valuable than the password to
Defense Deptartment computers.

Right away I can see that there's a question of subjectivity - how
importance of info is determined may not be proportional to how
important the info is to different people (My SSN won't be as
important the the Gov't as, say, the codes to launch missles at Moscow
would be, though I may feel that it's quite important).  But an
obstacle like that should be easily overcome if you consider the
question on a large scale, where the numbers of people affected is 
increased - perhaps the difference between public and private might
suggest something?  But then again, what is more important - private
freedom or public safety?

Just some random thoughts...

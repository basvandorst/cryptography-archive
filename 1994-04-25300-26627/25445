	This secret city probably exists, but the mathematical
	quality of Soviet secret cryptography is extremely low.
	First of all, KGB did not try to recruit graduates
	of Universities (at least as far as I know). Most
	of KGB crypto workers studied in KGB own schools.
	It was assumed (not sure if this is true) that
	all number theory works in characteristic two
	were classified. Jokers say that the usual premise
	"let p be the odd prime number" was due to this
	secrecy. However, in the KGB school mathematicians
	apparently did not study any algebra or number theory 
	except some char two classified textbooks. Another hearsay
	is that some KGB profi mathematicians came to Manin's
	(not sure, but I have heard this from his students
	so I assume that Manin's) seminar with some char. 
	2 problem and while talking it over they admitted
	that they heard of Galois group but don't know 
	what is it. It is true that Soviet "KGB algebraists"
	knew astonishingly much about char 2 (my friend
	studied cryptography by some semi-classified Soviet 
	textbook, and some powerful char 2 results in this book were 
	completely new to me), but they were much more specialized
	than Western cryptographers.

	It is possible. However, there is an excellent
	(non-classified) book on elliptic curves and code theory 
	written by Manin's students Tsfasman and Vladuc, so one may 
	assume that number-theoretic approach to coding was understood 
	by Manin's school quite early (in 70-ies). I have heard of public 
	key  methods from Kolmogorov's student Sasha Shen in about 1984,
	so by that time they were probably well known in Russia.

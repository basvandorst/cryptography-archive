I am a member of a large group of designers, embarking on a complex design
effort in VHDL.  In a meeting this morning, the subject of Configuration
Management came up, with opinions ranging from, "Leave the designers to 
exercise caution in what they do to the source", to "Designers will, whether
intentional or not, do something, some time during the project, that will 
cause great despair and discontent, if we do not *use* a configuration
management tool."  My experience is with "C" projects, both with and 
without CM.  I have seen the despair and discontent wreck a project, and I
have seen SCCS turn a catastrophe into a minor piece of rework. ( Guess my
position on this matter ... )

QUESTION : Is SCCS adaptable to a VHDL project?  Is there another CM tool 
out there specifically for VHDL? Does anyone have a good argument (anecdotal,
if possible) for or against CM?  Please post.  I follow this group regularly,
and would like very much to see this become a lively discussion.

Thanks very much.

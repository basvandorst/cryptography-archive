I disagree.  While it is true that the advent of the Internet and
distributed computing has increased the ability of an attacker to
actually break a key, I think that pure increases in computational
power helps both sides equally, in which case the cryptographer has
an advantage over the cryptanalysist.

For example, if you double the power of the computer, you half the
amount of time it takes to factor the number, but you also half the
time it takes to generate and use the number, which allows for longer
numbers to be used, which take exponentially longer to factor.

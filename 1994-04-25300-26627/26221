Just out of curiosity, what sort of compression ratio did you get?  Anything
resembling ASCII text is going to have less entropy than the original
"random" data, thus I'd guess that the result was a "compressed" file
actually LARGER than the original.  Most of the modern compressors actually
store a file UNcompressed if "compression" would actually EXPAND the file.

Did you smell something fishy here?  I do.

If this is from AP, it should have been published somewhere.  Anybody 
knows where and when this report was published?  Anyone?

People have been trying to break RSA ever since it was published.  A
full weekend's work by one individual is nothing compared with the effort
of thousands of researchers for almost 20 years.  Not even a semi-competent
grad student would say something like this, let alone an established
researcher like Denning (unless, of course, this is a different Denning
than I have in mind).

Who are these "top mathematicians"?  Gee, not only are they way ahead of
their colleagues in academia in the rest of the world.  They actually
refuted multiple statements widely conjectured to be true.  What an
achievement, wow!

This is obvious a joke.

Note the date--it's April Fool's Day.

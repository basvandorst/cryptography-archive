False. Read the NIST package on Clipper. State and Local authorities must
have a wiretap court order, they must certify they do and cite it with their
key request, and copies of the certification go to the Justice Department
and both escrow agences for auditing. The penalty for false assertions here
is a 5-year felony conviction, and if a State Assistant Attorney General
certifies a false request he, too is likely to be liable. Thus there's
likely to be due diligence at local, state, and federal levels; the penalty
is high, and the chances of being caught very good. Given the court ordered
wiretap statistics published each year, the number is so low that 100%
auditing is pretty easy if done immediately on a daily basis.

Don't believe a lot of the assertions, distortions, and selective quoting
you read here by partisans who in many cases have limited forensic skills.
Do what I did, instead. Get the Clipper package from NIST and read it
carefully. It's about 2-3 inches thick and there's LOT of material to
digest. Then make up your own mind. You'll be far better informed than if
you rely on distortions of distortions of distortions of incomplete
information posted here. The same applies to what I say. Check it out with
the source material.

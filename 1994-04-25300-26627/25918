   Perhaps not ignorant, however shall we say, underinformed ??? There are 
trivial ways to prevent any of the virii you mention spreading, turning off
the !Boot function is one. Updates to the OS are only loaded if you allow it.
In any case the point still stands. If you suspect you've let something slip
by, then reboot, and you'll have a virus free machine. (unless someone
knows how to burn ROM's on the fly ...)

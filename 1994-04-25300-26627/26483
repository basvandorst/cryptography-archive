harwood's right, though, derek; faster factoring forces users of
number-theory-crypto to accept higher and higher key-length overhead,
which already keeps rsa out of some applications where it would
otherwise be valuable. for example, it would be valuable in many
database applications to sign individual records with the identities
of each whoever modifies them, but adding 64+ bytes to every record
isn't very practical in large database installations.

also, as your own work shows, it's becoming possible to bring the
exponentially-rising amount of silicon in existence to bear on the
exponentially-complex task of factoring. it's not immediately
obvious that rsa's key-length will always be able to grow fast
enough, especially when algorithmic improvements are moving the
slopes of both of these exponential curves to rsa's detriment.

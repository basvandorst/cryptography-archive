/according to bruce schneider, in his book applied cryptography, "if the time

/are unscrupulous sysadmins, hackers, and others not connected with the
/government.  it seems that clipper provides plenty of protection against
/these groups.  clipper passes schneider's test of safety (above).

/sure, if you're planning some plot to overthrow the gov't, using clipper

/kind of things are such morrons that none of this matters.  everyone already
/knows that criminals have their phones tapped, and yet criminals still say
/incriminating things over their phones.  clipper won't make much
/difference.  easy availablity of good, strong crypto wouldn't either,
/because these types of criminals won't know to use it.
/
/basically, clipper is just another layer, providing good protection against
/many, but not all, possible adversaries.  as such, it seems like a good
/idea.  because it's in hardware, and will be in networking boxes, it will be
/a completely transperent layer.  of course, this does not mean that clipper
/is the only necessary layer.  it seems to me that:

DOn't forget, ANYTHING can be piggybacked on that thing.  The IMPLEMENTATION
is also secret.  As another stated, there could be a command to make both
ends drop to plaintext, or to use another preset key.  There could also
be code to access mass storatge (remember, this being hardware will be
able to bypass any system or OS imposed protections).  Sure would be no
problem to read whatever is in core at the momemt.

Do you REALLY want that on your system?  I sure as hell don't.  No more
than I would want some virus code in my kernel.

/pgp + clipper >= pgp

With that in mind, pgp + clipper may not equal pgp + clipper at all.

Not if clipper can access the data BEFORE pgp processes it, like directly
from core or mass stg.  All in the background, w/o the users knowlege.
Using its own built-in CPU.

It is said that the chip IS an oversized, power-hungry pig of a thing.  What
the hell is IN that thing, anyway?   What power levels do existing
encryption chips need?  If it is much larger, what is the power for?
What is consuming it?  Shunt resistors?  Would it show evidence of
a CPU present in the thing NOT being used for encryption?  Is testing
for this even possible?

To accept this and plug it into your system on blind faith would seem 
to me to be the height of folly.

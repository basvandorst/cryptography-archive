Actually, Dale, given that the algorithm and chip design are
classified, there is no way to prove to me that there *isn't* an
additional back door besides the front door that's already there.

As the recent press release admitting to the "bug" in the SHS
indicates, it's entirely possible that a secondary "back door" exists
in Skipjack which is unknown to the designers.  Unless the algorithm
is published and subjected to the same degreee of scrutiny as DES,
there is no way that any civilian can make definitive statements about
whether the Skipjack algorithm used by Clipper is or is not secure.

: I don't think so. For the same key length, the 64,000 processor Connection
: Machine DOD is said to have bought should take a lot less than 4 days,
: depending on what the ratio of average time spent per day on the
: workstations is compared with full time on the Connection machine.

: And if a 64,000 processor machine is one we know about, what do you suppose
: they have that we don't know about?

A customer of ours has just put in a machine for doing online database
lookups.  It has a Gigabyte.  Of *ram*...   Scared the bejeezus out of
me.   I'll have to see about donating some idle cycles to the next
big factoring project when no-one is looking ;-)  A lot of algorithms
(and the latest factoring ones I think) can get a linear speedup
from linear increases in ram just as they can from linear increases
in CPU speed or linear numbers of CPUs being thrown at the problem.

My off the cuff guess is a Gig or ram is probably another 8 or 10
bits of keyspace nibbled away.  Not significant, but scary to know
that that sort of power is being used in run-of-the-mill commercial
sites nowadays...

First of all, PRNGs are deterministic, given a common seed value.  That seed
would presumably be your "key", correct?  Unfortunately, most PRNGs don't
have a long enough seed to be really cryptographically secure, even if the
use of a PRNG didn't have other problems.  Most common PRNGs use a 32 bit
integer as the seed as well as the output.  The problem is, there are only
2^32 possible ways to seed the generator, or just over 4 trillion.

BTW, this question was covered in the Crypto FAQ:

8.10. Can I use pseudo-random or chaotic numbers as a key stream?
 
  Chaotic equations and fractals produce an apparent randomness from
  relatively compact generators. Perhaps the simplest example is a
  linear congruential sequence, one of the most popular types of random
  number generators, where there is no obvious dependence between seeds
  and outputs. Unfortunately the graph of any such sequence will, in a
  high enough dimension, show up as a regular lattice. Mathematically
  this lattice corresponds to structure which is notoriously easy for
  cryptanalysts to exploit. More complicated generators have more
  complicated structure, which is why they make interesting pictures---
  but a cryptographically strong sequence will have no computable
  structure at all.

But we will (probably) never be able to read the crypto of anyone with
the clout to use real crypto (e.g. RSA with big keys). Certainly
Clipper will not enable us so to do. Do you believe that any
significant enemy of the US is going to use Clipper? Clipper has the
potential to restrict the use of real crypto to groups with enough wit
and determination; it will allow law enforcement officials to bug Joe
Schmoe, IF AND ONLY IF Joe Schmoe is small fry.

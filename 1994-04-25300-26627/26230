	The Soviets used some book ciphers in WWII,
	Alexander Foote describes the method he used in 
	some detail in his book "Handbook for Spies."
	However, as I'm certain others will point out to
	you, a superencryption derived from any structured
	language is cryptographically weak because it is
	not random enough (by a long way).
	
	If anybody is interested in showing how resistant
	a book cipher is to present-day cryptanalysis, I'll be 
	happy to post the method and a well known paragraph or
	two encrypted by the method Foote describes.  I'll offer a bottle
	of good wine as a prize to stimulate interest.

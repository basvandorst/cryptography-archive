Let me guess, the executable only. :-)

You designed the algorithm so there is no way the same "carrier" can
be modified repeatedly, regardless of any possible password?  (Hint:
successive calls to most PRNG do not guarantee this; you need a large
prime number, a generator to that prime, and a fast exponentiation
function over a finite field.)

Uh, you wrote a program which hides a file within another program,
then have this same program ACKNOWLEDGE you did this by insisting
on the matching key?

Don't you think it would be wiser to willingly extract "the hidden"
file regardless of the validity of the key, or even the presence of
any hidden data?  That way they can't prove you hid anything because
your program extracts information out of *any* file, even a .gif
generated from a scanner in open court!

I won't even ask why you need a particular type of display to 
modify a binary file....

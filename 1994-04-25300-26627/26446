  Odd, so have I.  Many of them had your name in the message header.

  Not bad.  I hear the Chinese Embassy is still looking for a few more
good PR flacks; this ought to impress them.

  One of the main things learned from 5000 years of civilization is the need
to limit governemnt power -- by hard barriers on what governnment is capable
of doing, not by promises that government won't step over certain lines.

  Indeed; defective education and irresponsible parenting have produced
most of the people willing to permit the Hired Help (the government) to
get away with its current uppity attitude.

  Oh, well, you were on a roll for two sentences before coming up short.
I fail to see how a career bureaucrat who has spent the past decade adding
additional layers of parasitic infestation and illegitimate power to
offices that should have been abolished long ago (the federal offices
of education and drug policy, which are areas that should be handled locally
if handled by government at all) can contribute to solving the current
moral problems of the nation.

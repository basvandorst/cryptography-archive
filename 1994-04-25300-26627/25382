This is my argument against putting keys on keyservers - though, the other
side of the same one sided coin is that someone can do something claiming
to be me.  On the other hand, owners of the viacrypt version have nothing
to worry about legally.

On the issue of the newsletter, it just seems kinda silly as it will either
be encrypted to a long list of people, or many copies will be sent out
wasting bandwidth.  I don't see a need for encryption on a newsletter, though
I could see using pgp signatures.

methinks some people on this group are a little too paranoid.

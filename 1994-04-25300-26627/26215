   Isn't there some multi-processor effort underway to factor RSA-129?

Yes.

   Isn't it scheduled to be completed last week?

The network portion of the project finished about 2 weeks ago.  All
the data necessary to factor RSA129 has been collected, and that data
has been shipped down to Bellcore for processing.

   Why haven't I read anything about it?

We posted a message stating this in early April.

   Do they run into some problems?

No, no problems, just waiting for the final crunch to finish.

Hope this helps

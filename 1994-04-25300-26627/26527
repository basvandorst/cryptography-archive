I didn't think the CM-5 could get larger than 16k nodes...  perhaps the
figure for "64k processors" refers to 64k vector units, of which there are
four per node (so there would be 64k in a 16k node machine).  I don't know
the source of the information about the DOD machine though, so I can
only speculate.  Anyway, assuming a 16k node machine, the CM-5 has 32 Meg 
of RAM per node, which gives the whopping figure of half a terabyte of 
memory (exactly!  did you know this before you asked your question?).

Now the real question is:  I have worked on a 32 node CM-5 doing some
testing of parallel algorithms.  The 32 node CM-5 seems to have problems
staying up for more than a few days or before a processor dies, or whatever
(I think they've been through quite a few processor boards).  Has anyone
worked on a larger machine?  If the processor boards blow as fast on
a 16k node machine, it seems like it would be damned hard to have the
machine running for more than an hour at a time....

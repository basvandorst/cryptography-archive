Hi all!

As far as I know the first real virus protection came from two east
german students shortly after the unification. It is a small pc-card
which you put between bus and disc-controller and which enables you to
write-protect blocks of the disc. This is done in a way that you cannot
change it from any software, so no virus is able to either write to
protected blocks or turn the protection off.
IBM was very interested in putting this thing on the mainboard of their
PS/2-machines.

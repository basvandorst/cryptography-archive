The last time I read the security book, any encryption is ok - because 
you must still treat the encrypted file as classified material, so it 
doesn't matter if it is encrypted or not.
The only "approved" thing that I can think of is whatever 
hardware/software is used in a STU device. 
All of this is for civilian use - the military does whatever it deems 
suitable for the occasion.

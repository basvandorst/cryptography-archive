ESORICS-94                                               CALL FOR PAPERS

        European Symposium on Research in Computer Security
         Brighton, United Kingdom, November 7th-9th, 1994

ESORICS-94 (European Symposium on Research in Computer Security) is organised
by The IMA in cooperation with AFCET (creator), BCS Security Special Interest
Group, and CERT-ONERA.

AIM AND TOPICS: The aim of this symposium is to further the progress
of research in computer security by bringing together researchers in
this area, by promoting the exchange of ideas with system developers
and by encouraging links with researchers in areas related to computer
security, information theory and artificial intelligence.

Papers are solicited in the following areas:

- Theoretical Foundations of Security-

security models and specifications, contribution of formal logic and
information theory, formal development techniques

- Secure Computer Systems-

operating system security, network security, security management,
virus and worms, contribution of artificial intelligence, contribution
of new architectures and new technologies

- Security in Data and Knowledge Bases-

- Security in other Applications-

transaction systems, process control, real time, distributed
applications


- Cryptography Applications-

authentication, key management, signature

- Security Verification and Evaluation-

formal methods, measure and evaluation of risks, measure and
evaluation of security, criteria, protocol verification

- Software Development Environments for Security-

- Operation of Secure Systems-

management, intrusion detection

- Security versus other requirements

Security and costs, performances, dependability, safety, reliability,...

All application fields are welcome (medical, industrial, financial,
copyright,...) as long as the proposals remain in the scope of
research in computer security.

This list is not exhaustive. Research papers, position papers and panel
proposals will be welcomed.


SUBMISSIONS: The deadline for submissions has been extended to May 12th, 1994.
Submissions arriving after the deadline cannot be considered. Six copies of
papers or panel proposals should be submitted to the program chair at the
following address:

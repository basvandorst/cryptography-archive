That pretty well covers things (our newsfeed was broken for a few days so I 
didn't see the original article).  Noone seems to know anything beyond the 
text of the original announcement, I'll only make the change if there's a 
very good reason to ("Change this, trust us" isn't a good reason :-).  
Whether a change will be necessary depends on the exact nature of the 
"weakness" as well, for example a strong (collision-free) hash function 
could be degraded to a weak (universal one-way) hash function without 
affecting the security of SFS, which relies on the difficulty of inversion 
rather than the difficulty of finding a collision.
 
In the abscence of further information, I'm adopting a wait-and-see attitude 
(besides, I'm too busy adding other enhancements to SFS at the moment, I 
hope to have an updated version out Real Soon Now).
 
Peter.

Flame on!!!
Come on you silly twit!!!  He's got a routine that picks out chunks
of text from previous holidays, combines it with the days date and
counts out how many days it was from the previous holiday.  It's a
very well done joke.  I wouldn't mind seeing his table of holidays
(some are pretty bizzare me thinks).  
Flame off.

I think it's a cute .sig.  Keep it up!

Patience, persistence, truth,
Dr. mike

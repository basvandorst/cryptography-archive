   Thirded (or whatever). I had wondered what became of the proposed
   sci.crypt.research. If no-one else wants to I could probably be persuaded
   to draft a charter and RFD/CFV. I could even moderate it although someone
   with explicit credentials in cryptography would of course be preferable.

Fourthed.  I offered to be a non-US moderator, as some folk are
worried about posting crypto-related material from the US to a global
audience.  Bob Silverman also volunteered, I seem to remember.  No
idea, of course, whether that offer is still open.

I'd support Tony's candidature, should it come to a vote.

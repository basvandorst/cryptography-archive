I have read that mmb uses mulmod 2^32-1, if so, how do you handle 2^32-1
and 0, both of which need inverses under this operation.  Is there any fast
way of implimenting an invertable 32 bit multiplacation, like was done
with idea, that also runs fast on 32 bit machenes?

Can you get a group operation out of this?  I don't see how with a number
smaller than the data size.

Roger.

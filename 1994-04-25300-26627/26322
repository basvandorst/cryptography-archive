   Hmmm.  I see all kinds of problems with this.  DNA sequences aren't
random, though they carry a lot of information, so you can probably
compress them down with a crypto-strength hash into a useable key.  Are
the DNA sequencing procedures effectively error free, or can they be
macde effectively error free at some reasonable cost?  If not, then
your key will be different every time.  What do you do with identical
twins?  If I get your whole family (10 siblings + both parents), can I
re-derive likely snippets of DNA sequence?
 
    The general idea could be used for something less easy to come by,
such as a retinal scan.  But again, what do you do about scanning errors?
 
    Your key is going to have to be generated by some process *from* the
DNA/retinal scan/whatever, at least if it's a public key in any scheme
I've ever heard of.  Anyone know of a PK scheme using a random encryption
key?  I can't see what would make such a scheme possible--it's just as
random to me as to you, so how do I get a secret key for it that you can't
get?

    If your key is derivable from your DNA alone, you'll be able to get
a fresh key so long as you can donate tissue of any kind.  Blood, hair,
semen, skin should all work, right?  Yes, that's definitely a problem
from a security standpoint....

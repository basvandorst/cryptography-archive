There's one other VERY important reason you might want a hardware crypto
card.  Without one, where do you store your keys so they're guaranteed to
be secure??  I think that's probably a more important security issue than
where the algorithm itself runs.  If I can snatch your keys, I can come up
with the algorithm on my own to make use of them.  A good crypto card will
have on-card secure key storage, preferably with tamper-resistant packaging.

When you're thinking about the pros and cons of various choices in crypto
implementation, don't forget that there is a wide range of applications.
The bank that's using crypto to protect multimillion dollar funds transfers
probably has different requirements from the casual user who wants to have
some degree of privacy on his or her email.

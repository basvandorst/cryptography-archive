Green Card Lottery 1994 May Be The Last One!
THE DEADLINE HAS BEEN ANNOUNCED.

The Green Card Lottery is a completely legal program giving away a 
certain annual allotment of Green Cards to persons born in certain 
countries. The lottery program was scheduled to continue on a 
permanent basis.  However, recently, Senator Alan J Simpson 
introduced a bill into the U. S. Congress which could end any future 
lotteries. THE 1994 LOTTERY IS SCHEDULED TO TAKE PLACE 
SOON, BUT IT MAY BE THE VERY LAST ONE.

PERSONS BORN IN MOST COUNTRIES QUALIFY, MANY FOR 
FIRST TIME.

The only countries NOT qualifying  are: Mexico; India; P.R. China; 
Taiwan, Philippines, North Korea, Canada, United Kingdom (except 
Northern Ireland), Jamaica, Domican Republic, El Salvador and 
Vietnam. 

Lottery registration will take place soon.  55,000 Green Cards will be 
given to those who register correctly.  NO JOB IS REQUIRED.

THERE IS A STRICT JUNE DEADLINE. THE TIME TO START IS 
NOW!!

Yes, and it requires more than a wish and a prayer to carry one off.

Back to the Civics class with you! This was the design intent of ours.

Yes, they'll try.

I'm not.

Now you're arguing with yourself.

Revolutions require more than guns. They also require communications.
The genius of the Second Amendment is that it tries to ensure that the
guns will be there. We need to be sure the communications are there, too.
Under such circumstances, a government that goes too far will face a fast
reprimand that can't be ignored. A good way to stop oppression before it
starts is to make the probable cost very high and extremely visible.
That's the idea: to make revolutions unnecessary.

There is a big difference between a military action and a police action.
Even massive police actions must fail against a widely armed populace.
Your counterexample is absurd.

A right is not something that you buy, or that somebody buys for you,
or gives you, or steals from somebody else. A right is something you
have by virtue of what you are. You *have* a right to communicate with
those who are willing to listen, by any means you can afford. You *have*
a right to defend yourself, and a right to possess a means to defend
yourself; but nobody has to buy such a means for you. You *have* these
rights because nobody ever asked you if you wanted to be born, or where
you wanted to be born, or who you wanted your parents to be, before you
were born. Since you had no choice, you have no inherent obligation to
any person or government except to leave others in peace.

Ask David Sternlight.

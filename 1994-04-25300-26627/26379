The claim that this method does not rely on trusted individuals is suspect:

  - who is the referee and why should I trust him to verify that the 
    envelopes are sealed?

  - who is the person that handles the envelopes and why should I trust him
    not to open the inner envelope, read the extremely private answers to the
    questionnaire, and then place my questionnaire into another new envelope
    (since this person works for the association he has access to envelopes
    that look exactly like the one I was provided to enclose my response)?

Low-tech, low-stress, and low-security.  Clive would be right back where
he started from with this method.

Do you mean, a virus copies the application onto another place for
infecting them?
Then it has to change paths and setups too and this would be
impossible due to locked sectors.
Of course if you have a virus in the memory and unlock some sectors for
changing them then the virus can infect something.

It is transparent to the user except the process of locking/unlocking
sectors.

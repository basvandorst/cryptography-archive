Does the original 4/16/93 announcement from the White House qualify?  

	 In order to assess technology
	trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),
	the President has directed government agencies to develop a
	comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates: ...
	     --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone
		  calls and data, under proper court or other legal
		  order, when necessary to protect our citizens;


Notice the "other legal order" -- explicitly distinguished from a 
"proper court" order.

A little later in the same document:

	Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on
	     a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation
	     encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to 
	     decipher the message?
	     
	A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a
	     court order, to do the wiretap in the first place. 


In other words, saying that arguing that the courts must be involved
seems to contradict the wording the White House used.  

So, David -- still going to maintain that the courts have to get involved?
The Government (at least the White House at one point) didn't seem to think
it was necessarily so...

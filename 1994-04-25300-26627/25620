I ought to add to that post just a few details:

Instead of x += x - a*x*x, you can make the iteration step
x *= (2-a*x) and save one addition per step, reducing it to
two multiplies and one add.

You can also use a third-order recurrence,
t = a*x - 1;
x *= t*t - t - 1;

For an additional two adds and a multiply, this triples the number of
valid bits.  If you want, you can use this to take a 3-bit estimate to
a 9-bit estimate and avoid the bit twiddling needed to make a 4-bit
estimate to save an iteration.  It depends on your multiply speed.

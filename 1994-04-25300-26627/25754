Try _Scientific American_, sometime during fall of '93.  Sorry, I don't
remember the exact month.  L. Pecola (sp?) (of NRL) and someone else wrote the
article.  Mr. Pecola has written several other published articles on
this, so an author search in some periodical database would certainly
reveal some interesting material.

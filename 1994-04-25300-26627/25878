    I guess I should have stated this in the posting...I am NOT the 
author of this algorthim. I posted the announcement on behalf of the 
author, Dan Nelles of Toronto, Canada. I appreciate the comments but they 
need to be directed to Dan Nelles and not to me. Please direct all comments, 
suggestions and flames to the author at:

                          dan.nelles@ablelink.org

I encourage everyone to evaluate this algorthim and let Dan know what you 
think.

See ya round!

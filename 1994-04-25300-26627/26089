Yes, I agree that secure key storage sounds a good idea.

Has anyone looked at the merits of storing keys in smart cards? For example,
I came across an OKI Processor Smartcard with 5MHz processor, 8kbytes ROM,
192 bytes RAM, 8kbytes EEPROM running a secure operating system, which looked
as though it might serve the purpose well.

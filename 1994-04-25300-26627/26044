   : Put a personals ad in your local rag, saying "Mesopotamia."

   But post it from either London or Oakland.

You could take the boring approach of sending a message to
majordomo@toad.com saying "help" on a line by itself in the message body,
or the more interesting approach of sending a secret message to the
same address.  If the response you get doesn't mention it,
list volume is often 25-50 messages per day; you might want to send it
to your spare mailbox if you don't want that much volume.

Some weeks it's mostly signal, some weeks it's 80% politics.

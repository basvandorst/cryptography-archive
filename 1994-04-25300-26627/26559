This shows some miscomprehension on someone's part. Each linear relation 
over GF(2) that comes out of the last part of MPQS produces a factorisation
of N. If N is the product of two primes p.q (as the RSA-129 number was "known"
to be) then there is a 50% chance that you get N.1 and a 50% chance that you
get p.q, and the chances for each new relation are (heuristically, anyway)
independant. So three false drops before the success was indeed (mildly)
unlucky. With the methods used there would have been no problem keeping up
the supply of new linear relations for a long time.

By the way, all this *was* done with (state of the art) MPQS, so those posters
who are scaling up to larger numbers using the formulae for NFS are making
unwarranted assumptions (quite apart from the fact that using only the
assymptotic complexity can give seriously misleading results in practical
ranges). NFS for general numbers has not yet been proved to be a practical
method, despite the claims that it will be Real Soon Now.

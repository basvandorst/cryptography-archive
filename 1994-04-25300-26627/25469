Yes, but it's not proportional.  I just looked at it again, and it's
actually 2^61.  So let's do a back-of-the-envelope calculation:

			Unmodified		Modified [*]
Key bits		56			768
Diff-cryp steps		2^47			2^61
Possible keys		2^56			2^768
Ratio			2^(-9)			2^(-707)

In other words, with the given DES key scheduling algorithm, they need
to search 1/(2^9) of the key space.  With independent keys for each
round, they need to search only 1/(2^707) of the key space.

[*] Each of the 16 rounds uses an independent 48-bit key.

Yes, I'd just been thinking in terms of their playing back all
calls to and from your home or office phone.  But it seems to me
that they could store and index the speakers' voiceprints for every phone
call.  This would let them find most of the calls you made from
phones other than your own, especially if they knew roughly
where you were, and were willing to listen to some false matches.

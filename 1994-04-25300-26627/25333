[asking for simple sub solving techniques for computers]

A man after my own heart.  The best method I have found (and implemented)
is to use a pattern word dictionary.  No matter how a word is encrypted in
simple sub, it does not change its pattern of repeating (or non-repeating)
letters.  

There are many words with unique patterns, and not necessarily the weird 
ones.  "Management" for example.  Others have but few "usually" "fifteen",
"totally".  Many simple subs can be solved by these unique or limited
patterns.

The challenge comes with so-called daedal cryptograms, consisting of highly
distorted language whose sole purpose is to be a puzzle.  These can be
solved by "cross reducing" pattern lists.  Consider the two words 
"instructor" and "strident".  Notice that they share letters in common.  It
is a fact that no other words share just those letters in just those 
positions.  So, basically your program searches both pattern lists 
constrained by the common letters.

The nastiest cryptograms consist of all three-letter or four-letter words.
These are solved by cross reducing every list against every list in round
after round.  

Only a very few cryptograms will not solve this way.  The solving can be 
completely automatic.

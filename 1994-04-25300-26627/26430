I summarized the Post article in a recent article in RISKS (aka comp.risks).
I visited the museum a couple of weeks ago; it's got a few neat things,
but it lacks a lot of depth.  For example, there's no explanation of how
any of the cryptographic devices work; they just show them.  It's worth
stopping in for an hour if you're in the neighborhood, but I wouldn't
go out of my way for it.

To get there from Washington DC, take the Baltimore-Washington Parkway
(MD 295) north.  Exit at Route 32 east.  Large brown signs will direct
you to make an immediate left, and then follow the gravel road around
behind a Shell station to a barbed-wire surrounded building.

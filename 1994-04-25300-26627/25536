The Electronic Frontier Foundation is concerned because the FBI
Digital Telephony bill makes call-setup information available to law
enforcement.  (We'd oppose the bill anyway I'm sure).

Future cellular phone systems currently in the works keep pretty good
track of where a mobile phone is most or all of the time.  If phones
are small enough, people will carry them around wherever they go.  The
data kept by the carriers could be a gold mine for law enforcement and
a disaster to personal privacy.

I think there need to be strong restrictions on disclosure of all the
bookkeeping information, not just the content of the calls.

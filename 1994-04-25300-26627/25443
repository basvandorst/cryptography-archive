I've heard that there is a product that will allow two 
Macintosh computers to be used to be conduct a "secure"
phone call encrypted using public key algorithms. I've
also heard that a company is now selling PGP for corporate
use under a license from RSA. I'd appreciate it greatly if
anyone could tell me how to get in contact with any of these
companies.

Plaintext autokey *is* the way it's supposed to be done.  The 1st n plaintext
letters are enciphered as normal.  Thereafter, the plaintext from the 1st
character onwards encrypts the rest of the plaintext.  For example:

NOWISTHETIMEFORALLGOODMENTOCOMETOTHEAIDOFTHEIRPARTY  plaintext
SEEDKEYNOWISTHETIMEFORALLGOODMENTOCOMETOTHEAIDOFTHE  key
...................................................  ciphertext

It's rather nice, and stronger than other autokeys.  This is the cipher
that Vigenere invented.  He had nothing to do with the cipher that bears
his name.

Try to sell a piece of industrial equipment that uses what you call a
closed loop: a system without external sensors, a machine in control of itself
and others but without significant feedback from those being controlled.
You'll starve.

You can find closed loops in Bill of Rights.
You can't find one in Clinton's announcement of Clipper,
with its disavowal of a right to strong crypto.

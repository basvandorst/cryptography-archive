Good morning Vietnam! The problem with your proposal is that if you take an
algorithm (almost any algorithm) and convert it into VHDL straightforwardly,
you're in for some surprises.

Anyone else who has done ASIC design using VHDL will agree. Some things work
well, others VERY badly, and taking a C program and converting it to VHDL
provokes the latter.

So despite powerful new design tools hardware design remains hard just as your
cleaning lady isn't suddenly able to write an operating system using Nextstep. 
Or the way we put it:

A fool with a tool is still a fool...

There is a right to the things that I make with my own hands in Natural
Law. And this right might be taken away from me, as a mathematician, 
by some of these encryptor laws. I remember reading an article by
Martin Gardner, in his book _Penrose Tiles and Trapdoor Ciphers_, about
a mathematician who wrote an article on number theory and was ordered
by the government to destroy his research materials and keep his research
a secret, even though he has a natural right to express his ideas, a
natural right to explore ideas, and a natural right to advance his
career with his research. What the government did there was censorship.
It is dishonest and it is unwarranted. What the government proposes
is to widen their power to squelch the free exchange of ideas. This is
counter to the precepts of Natural Law and of Jeffersonian Democracy.

I'm not saying we should overthrow the government. I'm saying we
ought to refuse and resist. Not cooperate. Passive resistance still
works in in cyberspace.

Homomorphisms Not Homophobia:Refuse And Resist:Say No To Clipper
"The term 'institutional security' is so far-reaching that whenever there
is nothing to lock a prisoner down or harass him for, staff, correction 
officers and most any figure of authority in any institution will pull out
this ambiguous term."	-"Monster" Kody Scott, from _Monster: The
			Autobiography of an LA gang member_.

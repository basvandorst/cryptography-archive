I support the notion of a "sci.crypt.research" moderated group, though
I think it less urgent than some folks do. The creation of
"talk.politics.crypto" was intended to move much of the
political/Clipper/NSA talk out of sci.crypt, and I think it has mostly
succeeded.

But if such a group is to be moderated, why not with multiple
moderators?

Here's a proposal:

* 2 or more moderators, each with approval authority. (Handling
updating, to avoid repeats, seems doable.)

* At least one moderator _outside_ the U.S. (ensures that articles
cannot be blocked by pressure on the U.S. moderator, however unlikely
this may be).

* At least one moderator _inside_ the U.S. (Actually, I'm not
convinced the U.S. has to be given a "slot," but there are a lot of
qualified moderators here.)

Multiple moderators also cut down on the delays and workload faced by
a single moderator, while not significantly increaseing the "noise"
articles that still get through.

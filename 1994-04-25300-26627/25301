	I have been interested in prime numbers, and in factoring methods
in a casual way for some time, and the recent hubbub about RSA129 got my 
interest up again.  I am not a mathmetician, but I am interested in 
puzzles, and have math experience from the point of view of physics.  I was
wondering if anyone out there can recommend a good book on the subject
that is not written at a really high or really basic level.  If you can, 
please email me at aas@scruffy.phast.umass.edu .  I will try and keep an 
eye on this newsgroup as well.  I expect that with all of this RSA129
stuff there will be others interested as well.  A general cryptoanalysis
book might be a good bet, but I don't know of any offhand.  Thanks!

   The system which would be compromised would be the Key-Escrow system.
   If the algorithm became known to the general public, it would be a simple
   matter to make Clipper chips whose keys are NOT escrowed.  And they
   would probably be cheaper too.  This is why Skipjack is Classified, to
   prevent the production of 'fakes'. 

It's worse than that.  First of all, stronger crypto *is* available;
keeping SkipJack obscure doesn't prevent people from using better stuff.
However, if the SkipJack and LCM-1 algorithms are known, and somebody
borrows the Family Key from his Big Brother, he can do more than make
non-escrowed Clipperphones - he can crack any Clipper conversation for
which the "escrowed" keys can be obtained.

   Now, Skipjack may have a trapdoor, too,
   but their is no reason to infer this from the fact that it is Classified.

Of course it has a trapdoor.  There's a big door in the side with a
big neon sign saying "Cops and other Authorized People Only";
the trapdoor is the fact that anybody with a fax machine can make 
themselves and "Authorized Person" badge and walk in.

There's another trapdoor, which is that if you can predict the escrow
keys by stealing the parameters used by the Key Generation Bureau to
set them, you don't need to get the escrow keys from the keymasters,
you can gen them yourselves.

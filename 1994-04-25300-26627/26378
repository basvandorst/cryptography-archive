I'm looking for information on the Clipper chip for a policy project.
I'd like to get as much factual data as I can and written statements
from prominent political figures who oppose or support the plan.
I didn't see an FAQ, so I thought I'd just ask if anybody can point
me to an archive that might have the government documents about it
and, if possible, a few recent news reports about it.
Any help would be appreciated.  Thank you.

WHOOPS!  I said something stupid, so I'll try to correct myself before
someone points it out to my embarrassment:

But differential cryptanalysis does not examine the key space; it uses
plaintext pairs to determine a key.  At any rate, my point still
stands: using independent keys increases the search time, but not
proportionally to the increase in the size of the key space.

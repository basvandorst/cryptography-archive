So far PGP with RSA is ok.  But as the RSA docs themselves state, as
computing power increases you will need to increase your key length.  The
effect of this s that if someone COLLECTS your mail, they may be able to
crack the older stuff.  Some secrets you want to stay that way forever. 
The thought of some future exposure is really ugly.

Could be I'm a moron.

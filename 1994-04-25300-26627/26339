Assuming you're using a DOS machine (as you want to use SFS):
While FDISK is one option, it requires you to backup everything 
on the hard drive and then restore it after repartitioning.  Another tool is
FIPS, available via anonymous FTP from garbo.uwasa.fi, which will create a
new partition on a DOS disk without having to delete everything first.  The
directions in FIPS are very specific.  Print them out and follow them step-by-step.

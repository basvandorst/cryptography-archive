If anyone is interested, the paper described CDMF, the "Commercial Data
Masking Algorithm".  It appeared in the 1st ACM Conferencxe on Computer
and Communications Security, Nov 3-5, 1993, p.93-96, and was titled
"Design of the Commercial Data Masking Facility Data Privacy Algorithm".
The full paper will be published in the next issue (dated March 1, 1994)
of the IBM Journal of Research and Development and is titled,
"The Commercial Data Masking Facility Data Privacy Algorithm".

A friend of mine has a degree in Computer Science and wants to go into
"Computer Law." He's heard of a guy named George Trubow at John
Marshall Law School in Chicago, who organized a recent conference
on Clipper. Trubow is apparently interested in "Informatics Law." 
What precisely is Informatics Law and what area(s) of the law
is/are relevant to it?

"The term 'institutional security' is so far-reaching that whenever there
is nothing to lock a prisoner down or harass him for, staff, correction 
officers and most any figure of authority in any institution will pull out
this ambiguous term."	-"Monster" Kody Scott, from _Monster: The
			Autobiography of an LA gang member_.

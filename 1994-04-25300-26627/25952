This just my personal opinion, but I disagree with the above.
It is not clear that there is a moral issue involved in loss
of privacy.  The moral issues are about how people ACT on the
information after they discover what was private.  I personally
don't see what I have to lose by losing my right to private
communication, as long as I am protectd from employment discrimination
on the basis of its content.

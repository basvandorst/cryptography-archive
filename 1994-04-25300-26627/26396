This brings up an interesting thought: If the Skipjack algorithm is 
classified then any device able to communicate with a Clipper chip would by 
definition contain classified information and would have to be handled 
accordingly.

Am not sure just how this would affect distribution of Clipper chips (each 
one designated as a secure repository ?) but it would leave any clone 
manufacturer or anyone having a clone open to a charge of "possession of 
classified material." Interesting.

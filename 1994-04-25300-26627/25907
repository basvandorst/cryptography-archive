ok, this may have been previously asked a hundred times, but since
i didn't see the answers in the faq, i'd like to ask if anyone here
can answer the following questions...

  1.  what (exact) forms of double and triple des there exist, and
which are the standard ones?

  2.  does triple des in cbc mode use one 64-bit iv, or 3 64-bit
iv's, or what?

  3.  is triple des with 112-bit key more secure than double des,
and how much more?

  4.  is there a standard way of hashing a long password to a
(double, triple) des key, and what is it?

  5.  is there a (standard) way of using double or triple des with
128-bit blocks, and would that increase its security?  (and what is
it)

   Not that this is terribly relavant to the ongoing discussion, but 
pretty much all the information (plans, theoretical models) needed
to build an atomic (first generation) bomb are available in rather
similar places to most algorithmic descriptions of encryption 
techniques.  The barriers to most countries building a bomb are:

1) Acquisition/creation of enough weapons grade fissionable material.
2) Acquisition of specialized secondary materials unique to atomic weapons.
3) Acquisition of machine tools accurate enough to build the physics package.

   Most of the bans on nuclear weapons you hear about in the news are bans
on possesion, not on the sale and transport of plans for these devices.

   Actually, it's kind of interesting the number of parallels you can draw
between A-bombs and encryption technology.  If you happen to have plans for
building a bomb and a hardware E-cracker chip, neither one will do you much
good unless you can get the parts....

  Oh, *puhleez*!  Do you really expect to get away with a semantic shift
from direct cause-and-effect (crypto killing people in the same direct
fashion as a bullet or a blade) to picking out one element in the stew of
contributory factors ("people died because of encryption" -- yeah, right:
one might as well say that people died because of cartography, since the
Japanese would have gotten lost in the Pacific without it)?

If we're going to push *commercial* books and software, and tout
capabilities and reviews,  then  shouldn't SCI.Crypt also be open to
product announcements and *all*  commercial products without flames?  

How about a resume service for wannabe cryppies?

What about a product and services directory?  

Does it seems a little hypocritical some tout their products while
flaming "commercialism" on Internet?

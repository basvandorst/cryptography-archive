Actually, this warning may be too mild.  With a 40-bit key, any person
with a modest amount of computing power can break the cipher.

Suppose a person has only a single encryption chip which can perform
1 million encryptions per second.  The time needed to exhaust all 40-bit
keys is

        2^40 / (10^6 * 86400) days
      = 12.73 days

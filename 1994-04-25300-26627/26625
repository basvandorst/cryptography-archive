Does anybody out there know the encryption scheme Motorola uses for
their ASTRO line of radios or the scheme for their SECURENET system?
How tough would it be to break?  Motorola claims that at a speed of
1 million codes per second it would take 75 milllion years to try them
all.  Does this seem correct?

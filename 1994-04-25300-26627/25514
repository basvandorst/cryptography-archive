In reading about stream ciphers, and realizing the great pains people go to 
to create RNGs, I got to wondering if a random sequence (to be XOR'ed with 
the plainbit) is truly necessary, or if a secure encryption scheme is 
possible using, say, the last n bits of plaintext to encrypt the current 
plainbit.  

I have begun to look into and develop a stream cipher based on this 
concept and, although the concept seems unsophisticated, I believe my 
implementation may have some merit (but, as my cryptological experience is 
limited, I don't know how much merit :) ). 

I would like to post the algorithm for peer review, but am unaware of my 
rights to this not-yet-copyrighted algorithm.  Would anyone care to inform 
me of my rights?  Thanx!

Dan

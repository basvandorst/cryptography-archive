Yes, it looks like it might be beyond the capabilities of a CM2/CM200
models, like the one strnlght refers to.  Each of these 64K processors is a
relatively slow, 1-bit processor.  It's generally better to consider them
from the viewpoint of the floating point accelerators (we call this
"slicewise" mode), which are 1 FPA for every 32 processors, so this is more
like a 2K-processor machine.

However, the newer, CM5 models have enough processing power (each node is a
SPARC processor with optional vector units -- up to 120 MIPS/processor) and
memory (8 MB/node is the minimum configuration).  If 100% parallelism
efficiency were achievable, someone here estimated that the largest CM5
we've sold (1K nodes with VU's) could solve RSA-129 in about two weeks of
continuous processing (based on the estimated number of MIPS-years that
were used by the distributed project).

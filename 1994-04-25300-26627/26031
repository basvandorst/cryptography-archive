The phrase used in the press releases - not sanitized TV blurbs - goes
"Legal authorization such as a search warrant".  Note the 'such as'.
That statement does not limit to ONLY warranted searches, more like
"Whenever we feel like it, since we say what is legal".  And nothing
the government as said attaches any such 'search warrant only' limit.
Last I heard the government admits to that but will not give out the
specifics - at least not to EFF.  Rather the mood given is "Trust Us"...

Now, if the people were given the above info as stated, how would THAT
play in Peoria?

I saw a spec sheet for one but can't find it now... anyway,
the reason one would want it in h/w is it could handle 2-10 MBits/sec
without impacting the cpu load.

Plus, there is the old NSA answer...you just can not trust s/w.  if it is
not in h/w it is not any good  ;)

It was appx $300 US, if I remember correctly...about what you would expect
low volume almost one of boards to cost  (ie. this is what Capstone boards
will probably cost...if any one is dumb enough to buy them.)  (Ooops,
forgot about the government ;)

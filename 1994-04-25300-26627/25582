Sounds an awful lot like some sort of Capstone-based card, perhaps with
some other weak or escrowed types of crypto thown in for sales appeal.
For all I know, Capstone offers several "algorithms" for the user...
I expand on my rather pessimistic feelings on this in the
talk.politics.crypto group, if anybody gives a hoot.  But it would be
easy for National to build a card using their chips as glue, or even
encapulating a small package containing Capstone with their glue in a
common header and bill it as a new, great security package.

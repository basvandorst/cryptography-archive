However, Germany was what kind of government?  Is Hitler the analogy we want to
present?  Anyway, Poland actually invented the Enigma and offered it to many
countries, when Germany stormed in and took everything in ABOUT 1938 I think. 
Besides that, the Enigma machine was a cryptanalysts dream since it never
produced "an X in the place of an X".

Germany burned books (and people too).  Should this indicate the NSA mentality?

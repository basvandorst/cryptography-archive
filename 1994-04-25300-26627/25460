This National part is a PRNG with an external clock, not a random
noise generator.  AT&T makes a real random number generator based on
mutual clocking of allegedly uncoupled variable frequency
oscillators.  I'd be a little suspicious of its statistics,
personally, knowing how easy it is to get oscillators to phase lock.
Amplify some resistor noise if you want good randomness.

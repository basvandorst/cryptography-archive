[message attempting to teach me what reductio ad absurdum means, omitted]

I suggest you look up "reductio ad absurdum" in the dictionary. This is not
a mathematical seminar but a lay discussion group, and the technial usage
you cite is a specialized meaning used in partcular technical disciplines
and not even listed in my "Collegiate" dictionary.

I would say that the method of assuming the contrary and showing it leads to
a contradiction is only one form of reductio ad absurdum.

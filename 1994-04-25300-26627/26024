What you say is quite true, and should be a part of any attempt to
explain why the clipper programme should be scrapped. What needs
to happen now is the setting up of an organization to pool all
usefull threads into a coherent plan to be started at once. There
is no time to waste. Perhaps the EFF could take up the challenge?

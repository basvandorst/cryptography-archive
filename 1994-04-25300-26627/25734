Hmmmm, it used to be that people who had nothing intelligent to add to a
conversation signaled this by bringing up Hitler.  It's good to know that
they now bring up Saddam instead.

But of course we all know that privacy is just as dangerous as weapons of
mass destruction, so we should flock like lemmings to Clinton & Gore,
begging both to please, please take this privacy off our hands before it
causes us to hurt ourselves.

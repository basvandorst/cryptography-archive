There's a low-tech and low-stress solution to this.  Use two return
envelopes, one nested inside the other.

Respondents should be instructed to write their names on the outer envelope,
then enclose their questionnaire, sealed inside the inner return envelope.

Open the mail.  Save the outer envelopes for the drawing.  Toss the inner
envelopes into a box that'll later be used for scoring the questionnaire
questions.  A trusted individual isn't really necessary to protect the
respondents' anonymity, since the inner envelopes remain sealed (a fact that
a referee can verify).

This works for voting by secret mail ballot, too:  you can verify that there
are no duplicate ballots without ever reading one.

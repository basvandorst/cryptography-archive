Applied Cryptography is published by Wiley. Some publishers are better
than others. I remember using a Wiley textbook nearly 20 years ago and
(no surprise) it was infested with typos. So I think they're one of the
sloppier ones.

One of the things that has stuck with me from Knuth's Art of Computer
Programming Vol I Second Edition is that by that time he (and Addison
Wesley) figured they had enough of the typos expunged to "gladly pay
$2.00 reward to the first finder of every remaining error, whether it
is technical, typographical, or historical."

Schneier has done something similar. He is offering a free copy of the
source code disk to the first person finding each error. (Probably not
valid outside the USA!)

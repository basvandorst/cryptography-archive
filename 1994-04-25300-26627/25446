Grady, I think you've got it about right. God knows, at times, I've found DS's 
intellectual dishonesty (at times only on a par with that of a Marxist
commissar on a particularly bad day) exasperating, as is his sometime 
proclivity to attempt to smother argument in a welter of postings. 

That said, he has been known to be right, now and again. I would also miss his 
voice rather more than the cretinous braying of "Fascist" or other slogans 
from the political kindergarten.

Enough. Can we all now get back to cryptology? Followups to e-mail.

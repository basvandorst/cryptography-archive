I had Gale Glick at Greenway Books in Dallas, TX find a copy for me.
She found one copy that was in very good shape and mailed it to me.
Total cost for the book, her searhing and the postage: $51.71!  She also
found another copy that wasn't in such good shape that would have cost
~$40 total.

I'll provide her phone number, but, whatever you do, don't tell her that
*I* gave it out (in case thousands of rabid net fiends call her for the
next week or so). :-)  If you need her to mail the book, you'll have to
have a credit card.

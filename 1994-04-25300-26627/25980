There is a card, called ViruGuard(tm), which is a full hardware
anti-virus/access control system for PC's. It does keep all virus's out,
including boot sector ones. It has had every virus available thrown at it and
none, repeat none, has been able to get past it. 

I am connected with the company that distributes it in Europe and therefore if
anyone wants further info please contact me e-mail.

I must confess to being in a slight dilemma over posting the above info on the
Internet - on the one hand there is a product that solves a particularly nasty
problem, on the other there is the ethos of not posting commercial(read as
sales type blurb) information on the Internet. Your comments would be
appreciated. 

Regards
Mark

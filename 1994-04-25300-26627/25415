I have archived the entire 'CPSR is being hoaxed' thread if you want
to see proof of Sternlight's lying and deception. Saying that
Sternlight is a liar is the simple truth, defaming certainly, but
definitely not libelous.  He has my address in case he wants to
question my assertion through the legal process.

Sternlight is cyclical in that after being slapped around for getting
caught in bare-faced lies again and again he teetotals for a while.
But eventually he lands back in the intellectual drunk-tank.

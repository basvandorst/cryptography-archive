I thought that the predecessor of NASA was the NACA (the National
Advisory Council for Aeronautics) formed in 1915. Perhaps the 
Wright Air Development Center was a part of NACA (its not mentioned
by that name in my NASA history book), but it seems to me that the 
NACA Langley and Lewis centers would be more appropriately called
the predecessor of NASA.

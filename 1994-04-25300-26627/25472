        I have recently spent a little time in news.groups, and if
        anything is clear it is that one doesn't stand a snowball's
        chance in hell of getting anything changed unless 

                a) the names chosen are precedented

                b) there is sufficient existing traffic to justify
                   any proposed new group

                c) there is a 2/3 majority of voters (any _anyone_
                   can vote, remember) in favour of the change

                d) in any event, there are a minimum of 100 more
                   votes in favour than against

        With regard to point (a), the accepted practice appears to be
        to fall into line with groups like 

                sci.econ
                sci.econ.research

                sci.math             
                sci.math.research    

                sci.physics         
                sci.physics.research

        and so on.  As far as creating a moderated group is
        concerned, there would not appear to be any problem there as
        many sci.* groups are moderated (in fact, it would appear to
        be the norm for this heirarchy).

        It is on the voting that this may fall down.  Are we so sure
        that there will be over a hundred people more that are in
        favour of this proposal than there will be (inevitable)
        nay-sayers?

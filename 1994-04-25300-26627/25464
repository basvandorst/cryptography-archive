I do not 'blame' Mr. Sternlight entirely - you are correct to state that he's 
not the only one involved.  I appealed to the *OTHERS* who post in a seemingly 
genuine attempt to learn about (and educate about) these issues.  However, I 
concede the possibility that these posters enjoy the verbal sparring as much 
as Mr. Sternlight; perhaps even preferring that sparring to more substantive 
debate.

You are entitled to that opinion.  However, I am not attempting to stifle 
discussion of topics related to cryptography.  In fact, those discussions are 
exactly what I would *like* to see.  And as I have stated in a previous 
post, it is not Mr. Sternlight's views with which I take issue - it is the 
manner in which they are presented, and the tactics used to sidetrack the 
discussion.

I concede this point also, and withdraw my request.  Argue with Mr. Sternlight 
all you want.  As an alternative, I would now urge support for a moderated 
newsgroup (preferably sci.crypt.theory).

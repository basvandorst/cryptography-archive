I read about special chips guessing many keys per second. but how do you  
know when you are checking that the key is correct? I see 2 possibilities:

	1. textual analysis. Not very likely. Suppose the stuff is  
compressed?
	2. Decode-encode is not symmetric wrt encode-decode. Thus a piece  
of information that is decoded and then encoded only returns to its  
original state when the stuff was originally encoded with that key in tyhe  
first place.

Most probably I have it all wrong. So, enlighten me, please.

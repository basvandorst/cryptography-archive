It has been pointed out to me that ITAR contains its own definition of 
"public domain" which is totally different from the meaning of the term 
in copyright law. In essence, ITAR defines "public domain" as meaning 
generally available. without regard to copyright status. I have not 
checked this out but aspparently 22 CFR 121.1 says that material in the 
public domain is not covered by the Munitions List and also defense 
public domain.

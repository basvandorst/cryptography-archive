        Saw this first in 1986.  Basically it is just a 2-dimensional
        barcode about an inch wide and about 8 inches long, so you
        can print several on a sheet.  I can't remember much else
        about them, but I think there was embedded error correction
        code sufficient to be able to get the data back from an
        reasonable quality fax or similar.

        You could 'copy protect' them by swiping over them with a red
        highlighter pen.  Apparently photocopiers print out the red
        highlight as a black bar, while the strip-reader could read
        the dots through the highlight marker.

        Neat idea for its time, but not dense enough these days.

It is always possible to boot the system in a guaranteed virus free
state in which only the ROM-Modules are used. From there you can insert
a (hopefully) virus-free disc with a virus-killer and scan through the
harddisc. But on PC's a virus can easily destroy lots of things in the
CMOS-RAM. On the Archimedes a working CMOS-Content is stored in ROM and
you can easily access it.

Really, when I had a virus on my archimedes I booted the system without
reading the harddisc one single time!

They work with the following differnce:

	THEY INFECT ONLY APPLICATION PROGRAMS!!!

You can omit this by pressing a special key on the keyboard during resetting or
switching on. The first keyboard readings are always done by the ROM OS-core. So no virus can change this behavior.

You are not ignorant, but these things need a bit experience, at least you
should have used one for one week or so and read through the user manual, which
describes more than 20 possibilities of resetting and switching on.
But thanks for pointing to the Archimedes, it is really a quite secure system
(and a wonderful one too :-)).

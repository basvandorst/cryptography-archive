You know, I thought it was merely an accident of alphabet that loaded
the top of your archive's index with:

	Clipper: CypherPunks Archive
	Crypto-Anarchists
	Cypherpunk

Then I came to the "[Clipper] Non-technical Overview," which turns out
to be titled "Information About the Clipper Wiretap Chip"!

But thanks for your candid disclosure of your position.  Nice little
"blue sky" logo you got there, too.

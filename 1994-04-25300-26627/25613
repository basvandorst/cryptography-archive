  Time to encrypt/decrypt isn't much of a problem unless you have something
like an old 8086-based system; I've encrypted 70k files within a second
(actually, it's IDEA rather than RSA that takes more time when the file
gets bigger, but IDEA is fast enough).
  I've timed the generation of several 1024-bit keys on a 486DX/33; 5 minutes
is typical.

  As for time to crack it, IDEA seems to be secure as far as I know (i.e.
brute force is hopeless, and nobody knows a way to simplify the problem
enough to bring it within the range of available computer power).  As for
RSA, the best estimates I've seen for the factoring problem indicate that,
as a rule of thumb, adding 30 bits to a large number makes it 10 times harder
to factor.  If it's possible to factor a 425-bit number with the computer
power one can scrounge up (the RSA-129 project), then a 512-bit key (about
1000 times harder) is probably within the range of a rich opponent, a 600-bit
key (1000 times harder still) would probably strain anybody's resources,
and 800+ bits should be safe.

The NSA, at the point the private market, would CLASSIFY the technique.  They
have done this with INTEL when INTEL devised a method of REVERSE ENGINEERING
the Clipper Chip.  Intel came out with a method.  Intel is a private company. 
The NSA removed that method and knowledge from the public access.

My company is also working on many reverse engineering techniques and when we
come up with Intel or an equally successful method, it will be posted WIDESCALE
on many areas of the Internet.

Summary: Khufu has a key size of 512 bits (64 bytes)

The article on cryptography ("The Cambridge Algorithms Workshop")
in the April 1994 issue of Dr. Dobb's Journal says on page 20
that Khufu has a key size of 64 bits.  This is incorrect.

Khufu has a key size of 64 bytes (e.g., 512 bits).

Khufu is discussed in "Fast Software Encryption Functions"
by Ralph C. Merkle, in Advances in Cryptology, Crypto '90,
pages 476-501.

Khufu is covered by patent #5,003,597 which issued March 26, 1991.
Anyone interested in licensing Khufu should contact Dave Petre,
Director of Patent Licensing for Xerox, (203)968-3231.

Khufu has now been known for some years and has resisted cryptanalysis.
It is therefore of some interest as an encryption algorithm.  Those
who have a serious interest in its use might wish to wait until after
Crypto '94 before adopting a specific number of rounds.

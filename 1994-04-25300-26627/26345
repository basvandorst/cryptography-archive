Not a problem.  The main thing to do is pick a good IV.  Prepend 8 bytes
of random noise to your text, and it's effectively impregnable.

But IDEA is believed secure under a known plaintext, or even a choosen
plaintext (or ciphertext) attack.  SO being able to *guess* well what
part of the message is doesn't help.  Even knowing for certain doesn't
let you break it.

(Note: an IV doesn't have to be terribly random, just different each
time.)

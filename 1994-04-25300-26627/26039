why?

according to bruce schneider, in his book applied cryptography, "if the time
and money required to break an algorithm is more than the value of the
encrypted data, then it is probably safe."

to assess how useful a given cryptosystem is, we must assess who the
attackers are.  in my experience, 99% of the potential attackers to my data
are unscrupulous sysadmins, hackers, and others not connected with the
government.  it seems that clipper provides plenty of protection against
these groups.  clipper passes schneider's test of safety (above).

sure, if you're planning some plot to overthrow the gov't, using clipper
can't be such a good idea, but then again, most of the types who do this
kind of things are such morrons that none of this matters.  everyone already
knows that criminals have their phones tapped, and yet criminals still say
incriminating things over their phones.  clipper won't make much
difference.  easy availablity of good, strong crypto wouldn't either,
because these types of criminals won't know to use it.

basically, clipper is just another layer, providing good protection against
many, but not all, possible adversaries.  as such, it seems like a good
idea.  because it's in hardware, and will be in networking boxes, it will be
a completely transperent layer.  of course, this does not mean that clipper
is the only necessary layer.  it seems to me that:

pgp + clipper >= pgp

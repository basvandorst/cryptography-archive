Could someone please repost the results for RSA-129? Also
what did the coded message from Scientific American say?
I missed the original post here. Sorry!
As for life after RSA-129, how about the following?
In many Diophantine problems (e.g. Catalan's) the
problem reduces(in many cases) to finding Wieferich
pairs of primes, i.e. primes q,p such that
p^{q-1}= 1(mod q^2) or q^{p-1}=1(mod p^2). So far,
only 4 pairs of primes are known that satisfy both
conditions simultaneously. What are some others
for q<p, q<10^12, p<10^18?

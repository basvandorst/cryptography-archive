   Actually, Dale, given that the algorithm and chip design are
   classified, there is no way to prove to me that there *isn't* an
   additional back door besides the front door that's already there.

   [...]  Unless the algorithm
   is published and subjected to the same degreee of scrutiny as DES,
   there is no way that any civilian can make definitive statements about
   whether the Skipjack algorithm used by Clipper is or is not secure.

Even then, there is no definitive statement.  Someone may just stumble
upon some technique that breaks DES that no one happened to think of
before.  And even if they did, would they *tell the world about it*???

Paranoia reigns supreme,

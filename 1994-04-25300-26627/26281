: The following mechanism will provide general anonymity, unfortunately the
: winner risks his response being identified (all others, however, remain
: anonymous).

: I cannot think of a mechanism that is completely anonymous that does not
: rely at some point on a trusted individual.

:   1.  Every member who wished to respond and be considered for the prize
:       writes two (say) ten-digit numbers on the entry, picked by each member
:       at random and kept secret by the member.

:   2.  When the winner entry is picked, one of the ten-digit numbers
:       is published.

:   3.  For the winning member to claim his prize he must provide the other
:       ten digit number.  Unless your membership is very large :-), the risk
:       of collision with these numbers is relatively low.

Alternative:  Either the numbers are written on a corner and torn off to
be placed in a common drawing barrel, or split-number tickets are sent
with the questionnaires, returned with them, and placed in a drawing
barrel such as the one above.  Either way removes the link to the
particular respondent unless someone writes down the numbers before
seperation.

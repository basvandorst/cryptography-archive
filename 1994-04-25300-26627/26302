      Pseudoprimes and Factoring of N=P*Q

      Readers of my earlier postings on "easy factoring" of N=P*Q
will recall that the procedure is, indeed, easy when N is a pseudo-
prime in some base a or it can be recognized as a factor of such a
pseudoprime. In general, the latter task is a difficult problem,
as many of my correspondents have noted. However, the proposition
does not appear to be entirely hopeless. A rather cursory examination
of pseudoprimes generated by the Cipolla algorithm (see Ribenboim,1991)
discloses some remarkable regularities that merit, perhaps, a further
inquiry. Here, tentatively, are a few observations:
      1. If N is a true composite then it may be a factor of a
pseudoprime in base 2 when multiplied by an odd number that is
itself a factor, or a product of factors, of (N+2),
      2. Similarly, N may be a factor of a pseudoprime in base 3
when multiplied by a factor, or a product of factors, of (N+1),
      3. For base a>3 the multiplier may be found among the factors
of (a*N+1).
The multipliers need not be primes.
      Things are not as simple when N is a factor of some pseudoprime
in many bases. The relationship between N and the required multiplier
escapes me at the moment. I also realize that factoring N+1,N+2, etc.
may itself present a problem but that is the nature of this daunting
problem!
        Here is a low-level example:
        N = 838 860 7 = 47*178481
        N+2 = 3*279 620 3
        M = N*279 620 3 = 234 562 480 592 21
where M is a pseudoprime in base 2, psp(2).
      Readers comments will be appreciated.

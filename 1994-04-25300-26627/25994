So far, so good. There are several such cards on the market. What does
VirusGuard(tm) do? Write-protect selected parts of the hard disk where
the protected files and boot sectors are?

Here is where we disagree. I refuse to believe the above. Tell us how
the card works, and I'll tell you a couple of ways to infect a system
protected by it.

Including Brain, the first and the oldest boot sector virus? Hint:
this virus infects *only* floppies. Do you protect the boot sector of
the floppies as well? How do you format them, then? How about SYS?
What happens when I run LABEL A: on DOS 5.0 or above?

Ah, but this is not the way to test such things. Heck, even a scanner
can do it. Detect the known viruses, sheesh... A device like the
described one is supposed to protect also from unknown viruses. That
is, I am free to combine any of the types of virus attacks known to me.

No problem. First, my bet is that your product doesn't solve the
problem (at most it solves it only to some extent), and second, I much
prefer an informative message like yours than the blurb about the
green card lottery posted by a bloodsucking lawyer in every damn
newsgroup under the sun. :-)

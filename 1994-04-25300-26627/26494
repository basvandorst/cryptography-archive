PGP doesn't provide a convenient way to print it, but if you look
in pgformat.doc, you'll see the format.  In a public key, skip the
first 11 bytes.  The next two are the big-endian number of bits
in the following number, then comes the number itself, in big-endian
order, filling as many bytes as are required to make up the bit
count.

For your interest, the first 11 bytes are:

- Cipher type byte for public-key certificate (0x99)
- Length of packet (2 bytes, big-endian)
- Version number byte (2)
- Timestamp of key creation (4 bytes, big-endian)
- Validity period (2 bytes, currently always 0)
- Public-key algorithm (1 = RSA)

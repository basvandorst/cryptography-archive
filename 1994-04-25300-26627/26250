Well, when you say "posted" I am not sure if you mean E-Mail or surface
but would suggest the following: With each questionaire include both a 
"ticket number" and a unique "authentication value" for each ticket. You 
post the "ticket number" and the lucky winner replies with the 
authentication number. If the "ticket" is randomly selected, there is no 
correlation between ticket and questionaire.

Of course you could use PGP and get complicated but why ?

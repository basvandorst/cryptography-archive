Sigh.  It depends on what you mean by "could" and by "several times".
In principle the attacker could search the DES key space, looking for
a set of keys that decrypted the file into text.  Unless the amount of
randomized keys is comparable to the length of text (and if you can
generate this much randomized key material, you might as well used it
as an OTP directly), the chance of a truly random file being actually
being the iterated-DES image of a text file is very low.  This is a
result of the amount of redundancy present in text files.  There is
also the possibility of cryptanalysis of DES via exploting how some of
that redundancy might leak through the encryption.  Don't ask how this
might happen, because nobody knows.  The purpose of OTP's is to
eliminate the possibility by using true randomness.

This question is too vague to answer precisely, but look, the whole
idea of OTP's is that they are really random, they are not pseudo-random
via DES or any other method.

One clever method sometimes used for software-only RNG's is to
measure variations in hard disk latency reading a particular
sector over and over, interspersed with disk head seeks.  Some
of the variation is apparently caused by air turbulence within
the disk drive, which is very much a random process.  I don't
know of any rigorous scientific studies (theoretical or experimental)
of how much entropy you can really get out of this, but some
guesses I've seen make the method sound pretty good.  It's an
interesting question.

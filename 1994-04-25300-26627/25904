The system which would be compromised would be the Key-Escrow system.
If the algorithm became known to the general public, it would be a simple
matter to make Clipper chips whose keys are NOT escrowed.  And they
would probably be cheaper too.  This is why Skipjack is Classified, to
prevent the production of 'fakes'.  Now, Skipjack may have a trapdoor,
too,
but their is no reason to infer this from the fact that it is Classified.

   And, to be somewhat vindictive:
 
1.  Use some large-dictionary-based scheme to compress a large block of
    English text, say maybe netnews without the headers.
 
2.  Compress your message, and encrypt it with a strong algorithm.
 
3.  Decompress your ciphertext with the dictionary formed in 1.
 
4.  Encrypt your message with a vignerre scheme, maybe with a reasonably
    long key.

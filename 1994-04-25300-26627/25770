Thank you Dan.  We need more people getting to the point.
We spend too much time here, quibbling over unsubstantial details.
Details whose resolution do not contribute to a final solution.

Every amendment of the Bill of Rights makes law enforcement's job harder
to do. So the very reason to accept clipper, is the same reason to repeal the
first ten amendments.

So that argument is of no substantive value (except for vague emotional
5 second news clips).

Part of the problem is our misunderstanding of the role of law enforcement.
The police are to capture and stop criminals.
Individuals who singley or as a group commit crimes.
The police are not capable of, nor should be allowed to try to, "protect society".
Only the people can protect society.  And the biggest enemy "the people "
have is government.

I find the NSA manual informative in that it actively and as a matter of policy
encourages NSA employees to consider themselves above the constitution.
And that when you become an employee of NSA you loose your constitutional 
rights.  No wonder NSA cares not for the American freedoms. They don't 
have them.

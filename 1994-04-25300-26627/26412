While the announcement gave cause for concern, "broken" is too strong
a word.  Apparentmy some flaw was uncovered.  People are digging for
the details, and when that happens, we'll see.

For example, if the NSA won't say *what* the problem is, just
"to fix it, change X to Y", then there is the possibility that
it's designed to weaken it when used as a cipher as in SFS.
If that were to be the case, expect a delay of a few months whiile
civilian cryptanalysts look at it.

On the other hand, if the reason for the fix is clear, a new version of
SFS would no doubt come out promptly.

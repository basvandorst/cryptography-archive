I'll second this.  Further, and something I thought about posting when
I read this but didn't, is that not everyone in the world already has
nuclear weapons.  That is, everybody, and I mean everybody already has
access to strong encryption.  If they didn't invent it themselves, the
material has been well published and any high school senior can turn
those algorithmic descriptions into code.  This is drastically
different than nuclear weapons which, although some material has been
published, most of the good stuff is still secret and it takes many
good scientists and lots of money to manufacture.  Thus, it's
reasonable to expect that a nuclear arms ban will help stall the
development of the technology external to the US (although this also
has a finite lifetime).  If you want an analogy closer to the truth,
the current crypto ban is equivalent to banning .22 calibre deer rifles.

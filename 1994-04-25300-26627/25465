	A couple of months back they were bought out by a large US firm,

	injection to take on lots of new programmers and move to larger
	premises.  Draw your own conclusions :-)

Someone asked me if I could find out who bought Algotronix out...  turns
out not to be a big surprise I suspect - I just checked on the last inter-
office phone list from before they left the building (we shared a floor
in Edinburgh University's Technology Transfer Centre) - seems Algotronix
is now part of... Xylinx.

I guess now they're big and American rather than small and Scottish,
their technology will suddenly be seen as the greatest thing since
Milanda Pan... ;-)

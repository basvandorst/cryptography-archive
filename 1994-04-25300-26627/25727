WW> I know my Newsgroups line is kinda random, but I don't know
WW> where this question should go.

WW> I know that it's illegal to export encryption software, such as
WW> PGP, from the U.S.  Is it illegal to export the *decryption*
WW> half?

WW> It seems that it should be OK.  I know that LZW compression is
WW> patented but LZW decompression is not, so there's some
WW> precedent.

WW> If this is in a FAQ file somewhere, please point me to it.

WW> Thanks!

I've seen a post from someone who recently complained that his crossword
puzzle solving program was classified as munitions under a State
Department regulation.  The result was that this 'decryption' program,
innocent as it was, could not be exported from the U.S. without a
license.

:
:i)  You can always boot a PC from a floppy disk, containing DOS & an
:    antivirus.  (Yes, EXE_bug can still be present on PCs with an AMI
:    BIOS, but the antivirus can detect & disinfect it).
The intention was to say that the supplements are only loaded into the memory
when you want them to be loaded. (Or: They are not loaded if you don't want.
See below.)

:They can infect/replace OS updates.
Yes they can, sorry that I forgot about it, but I haven't got any update
module up to now. The usual update is a ROM-update. Other modules are
just application specific modules which are only loaded on request.

[Booting without any boot action]
:Fair enough, but this is not the default behaviour and requires deliberate
:selection of the user.
Recovering from a virus is never a default behavior.
It would be bad for the dayly use if the computer would not have such
a kind of !Boot or autoexec.bat wouldn't it?

:I expect it also interfers with some apps that expect this to happen?
Yes it interfers. You would have to execute the !Boot application
by hand (double click) and to register the resources to the OS
(open the directory which contains the resources) after the viruses have
been deleted.
Resetting is faster :*)


:Nobody's offered to lend me one, but I have chatted to users and read a
:couple of books.
If you have any Archimedes question not belonging to sci.crypt feel free 
to post to comp.sys.acorn... :-)


See you!

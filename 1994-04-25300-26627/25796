You've just made my point, David. One of the shared practices of a civilized
society is that people don't read other people's private communications.
I'm not talking about what Saddam is doing today: if Saddam isn't using
good crypto, he's even more of an idiot that we already know. Good crypto
is definitely "out there", and cannot be retrieved. That's a dead issue.
The only issue remaining is what my government can do with *my* private
communications. I do not recognize that what the government does is
necessarily right, therefore I wish to close off certain possibilities
and without punishment for guarding what I see as my best interests.

Hiding behind copyright is a ham-handed sleight. It's a good thing you
weren't around in Dickens' time: we might have had the Artless Dodger.

Hmmmm. Kind of like buying a cellphone with Mr. Bill's favorite chip in it.

We can now expect the usual bluster beginning with the phrase "Abell shows
what kind of person he is by..." that readers of alt.fan.david-sternlight
find so familiar.

As for your killfile, David, I will be honored to take a place on it.
As for jokes on the net, well...what can I say that you haven't already.

If anyone else out there is finding this tiresome, I'll slack off now.

I haven't seen anybody else mention this yet.  In the April 1994 issue
of Data Communications, page 17, there is a short news item that claims
that accused double agent Aldrich Ames may have sold information about
the Clipper initiative to the Russians.  A source is quoted "If there's
only a 1 percent chance that Clipper has been compromised, the whole
thing's over, and we have to start from scratch."

Of course, if Skipjack et. al. are really as secure as the Feds claim,
then disclosing algorithms and operating principles should not cause
Clipper to become insecure.  It would only allow others to build similar
high-quality systems, and starting over would not prevent this.  If there
are in fact some back doors, which have been leaked, then I can understand
the need to start over (or better yet, give up).

Unless Ames actually sold escrowed keys, in which case the whole idea
of key escrow should be dead as it would be proven to be insecurable.

So how could Ames "compromise" a system so secure that even Denning
could not break it in a weekend? :-)

I need some dictionaries for cracking.  Could someone point me to some
good ones.  I have encrypted by drive with secure drive, and forgot the
last word(or misspelled it, hell, if I new for sure I wouldn't
have to ask)!!!!!!!!!.  I am trying all 1 letter changes, 1 letter
insertions, and 1 letter deletions, and would like to move on to all words
in the third place.

Yes, I have a backup, but it is the instilation disks and my personnal
data, as the disk is 425meg.

Did anyone ever think that a "misspeller" cracking utility for security
programs would be a good idea?

Roger.

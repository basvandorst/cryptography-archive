There was another such ``card'' touted as the ``final solution'' to
virus (to use the correct latin plural, the u is long) by a Dutch
company.  If you can copy applications, you ca infect them.
Perhaps this will prevent bootsector virus, but it won't
protect against application virus.  Depending on the control
you have and how easy it's going to be to switch on/off the
device, it will be either hard to use and tehrefor switched off
or it will eb easy to use in which case it probably is controllable
from software.  (Which will give rise to a tailor made virus or
have them wait for the windows of opportunity.)

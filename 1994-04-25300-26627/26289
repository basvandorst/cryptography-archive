:        NIST ANNOUNCES TECHNICAL CORRECTION TO SECURE HASH STANDARD
:        -----------------------------------------------------------

:    The National Institute of Standards and Technology today announced it
:    will initiate a technical modification to a computer security standard
:    used to support the authentication of electronic messages.  The
:    revision will correct a minor flaw that government mathematicians
:    discovered in a formula that underlies the standard.

: Know any other existing or new standards that could use continued research?

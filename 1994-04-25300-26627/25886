I'm following this discussion with interest because I'm currently
generating some prime moduli for use with Diffie-Hellman. (DH is now
included in RSAREF, so I'm using it as the basis of an experimental IP
security protocol).

My understanding of the criteria for a DH modulus p is that both p and
(p-1)/2 should be prime, i.e, p should be a "strong" prime.

I know that strong primes are no longer thought to be required for RSA
key generation, but I understand that they're still a good idea for
DH, which depends on the discrete logarithm problem rather than
factoring (see LaMacchia's and Odlyzko's 1991 paper on discrete
logarithms, URL http://martigny.ai.mit.edu/~bal/field.ps).

Is this still the current consensus?

Phil

Before a huge argument ensues, just remember that there is great confusion over
just what is meant by the term "virus".  The internet worm, a marvelous 
example of the type of security problem described by you, is not (under most
definitions) a copmputer "virus".  If the original poster was implying that
by "virus" he meant something that "mucked" with the OS, then Unix is pretty
safe from virus attacks.  Granted, you can do pretty much anything you want
to a system if you have root, but then what would be the point of using
a virus?  Infecting a machine that's already "yours" doesn't seem too 
plausible.  The point is that some people don't even consider Trojan Horse
viruses "real" viruses, unless they somehow affect the operating system itself.
I think this was the point of the original poster.

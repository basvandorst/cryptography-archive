In article <1994Apr26.175211.26483@nmt.edu>,
Michaael Cantrell <fiacha@nmt.edu> wrote a very interesting response to my
comments on natural law and the social contract. Most of it stands
unexceptionably on its own. A few comments:

Sure. Although I am not myself a Catholic, as I understand it from seminars
and discussions Natural Law is one of the major underpinnings of Catholic
thinking, and has been for many hundreds of years. As a consequence, many
Catholic theologians and scholars have thought and written deeply about
natural law, and their work, apart from the special religious dogma of
Catholicism, commends itself to all. It has been the source, among other
things, of one of the main streams of thinking about the role of the Supreme
Court, and has come up repeatedly in confirmation hearings (without any
special reference to the role of specifically Catholic scholars in the
matter). The Jesuits are especially good at this kind of philosophical
thinking.

Deriving from the "common defense" and "domestic tranquility" content of the
Constitution, Congress has passed many laws giving wide discretion to the
Administration. In addition there is specific discretion deriving explicitly
from the Constitution--for example Congress cannot declare war; only the
President can. Thus the Administration has wide powers in defense matters
which do not require Congressional involvement.

In fact, in some cases Congress has to "get at" the President's
Constitutional powers via the back door--for example by refusing to
appropriate funds for certain things the President has the authority to do.

The view that Congress enacts and the Administration executes is a partial
and incomplete view of the way the Constitution has set up our system.

This is inaccurate. Since some matters (Clipper being one) are within the
Administration's legal purview, to prevent it one must get Congress to
intervene--thus lobbying becomes necessary.

In defense, intelligence, criminal, and certain economic matters the
government has an absolute right under the common defense and domestic
tranquility provisions to keep things secret if revealing them would lead to
unacceptable consequences. "The People" don't have any right to war plans in
advance; to know whose codes we've broken; to know in advance of charging
who the FBI is investigating; to know in advance of public release what
Agriculture's crop forecasts are. These are consequences of the
impossibility of telling "the people" some things without our military
adversaries hearing them; without those against whom we conduct legal
intelligence operations hearing them; of the damage to those under
investigation but not charged, from disclosure (I hope you saw "Absence of
Malice"), or of the nature of economic speculators.

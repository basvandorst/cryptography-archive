	Error rates in a good sequencing lab are probably much
	less than in 1 in 5000.  However, this uses careful
	people who will consequently be slow and thorough
	and will sequence the region 2-4 times to eliminate
	errors.  Sequencing costs using automated, and
	expensive, sequencers are heading towards 1 cent/base
	and with sequencing rates of several thousands bases/day.
	I don't have good figures on error rates on these machines
	but I believe they are very low.

	Depending upon whose data you believe, human
	DNA is of the order of 10% informational and 90%
	non-informational.  Although there may be several
	hundred different forms a gene (alleles), the difference
	between any two is often no more than two base pairs in 
	a gene of about 3,000 base pairs.  Could one succesfully
	avoid frequent hash collisions with such small differences?
	
	Sets of genes where there may be a great deal more  useful
	variations would be the somatic immunoglobulin
	(antibody) and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes.  These
	help define the difference between self and non-self.  However,
	the variation is in small islands buried in much larger invariant
	frameworks.
	
	The non-informational DNA is perhaps even less useful, much
	of it is made up of short sequences such as GTAAG repeated
	from 2 to several tens of thousands of times.  The sorts of polymorphisms
	now being used to identify individuals in forensics do not look at the
	sequences, but at rare single base changes in the repeated DNA and
	probably overestimate the real level of variation.  There may be completely 	
	random individual-specific DNA sequences in there, but they are probably
	hard to find.
		     	  
	You would stand a very good chance of reconstructing the sequence
	from that of your parents alone, if you knew which class of sequence
	was being used to provide the key.  This is a case of security through
	obscurity.

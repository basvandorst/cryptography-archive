Well, I have to admit *my* ignorance, having never heard of the
Harvard architecture. However, from you description I get that it is
some kind of machine with Separated Instruction and Data space. Well,
aren't most Unix systems of the SI&D type too? Does this architecture
apply only to memory or also for the disk? If it is only for the
memory (like in most Unix implementations), then it is perfectly
possible to write a non-resident virus. If the system is also
multi-tasking, then there is absolutely no need to try to make your
virus resident - just spawn a process that does the job. If the
restrictions also apply to the files, then how do you compile or copy
a program? I remember a model that was based on trustee rights about
which programs can do what, but as far as I recall, it didn't work
either.

Ah, that's a different thing - limited functionality. Yes, it can
prevent viruses.

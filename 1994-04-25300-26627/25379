Isn't the coding table based on the relative frequency of certain strings in
the file?  Couldn't this be analyzed as a somewhat complex "alphabetic
substitution"?  IOW, by analyzing the frequency of certain tokens, the
coding table could probably be reconstructed.

I've never tried this, of course, but that's probably the approach I'd try
first.

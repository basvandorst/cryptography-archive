Most of the citizenry of the United States, and the rest of the world are
under no contractual obligation to safeguard classified information, nor
legal obligation to preserve its security when coming in possesion of it.
It is illegal to pass classified information to foreign powers, however.

(It is not a crime to 'possess' classified information, depending on how
that information was obtained.)

Information in the public domain may not be classified, although the Atomic
Energy Act may make exception for nuclear secrets 'born classified'.

The masks of the clipper chip brethern are unclassified, having key pieces
of the algorithm programmed in (unit key, unit id, S boxes, family key and
programming options specifying use of the Law Enforcement Access Field).
The Skipjack algorithm is not complete without the programming.  Once
programmed the clipper chip device is included in an approved product,
and may be exported.  The secret process contained within is protected by 
antitamper features (Vialink antifuses whose conductivity is obscured by a 
top layer of metalization).

Were these features to be defeated (NIST published a report of a protection
lifetime of 4 years and a cost to recover the algorithm as high as $30M)
and the algorithm released into the public domain, it could not remain
classified.  It is probable that some degree of protection could be attempted
by copyright or perhaps secret patent.  This might stop open manufacture for
sale of clipper chip clones, but would almost certainly not stop software
implementations for casual use (such as is done in the case of IDEA in PGP).

You as a citizen of the United States or certain of its allies operating 
under color of various binding international agreements could not export
the information as specified by the International Traffic in Arms Restrictions
(ITAR).

The U.S. government has already moved to supress reverse engineering 
technology held by Intel - by classifying it, in an attempt to lengthen the
half life of the secret Skipjack algorithm.  

A useful modification would be the ability to lie when encrypting the
session key with the unit key.  Likewise an inconstant unit id has merit.
Either would allow the clone to operate without threat of 'escrow'.

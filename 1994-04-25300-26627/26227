The security of Smart-Cards/Digital cash etc depends on their being
uncloneable/unforgeable, that is in the impossibility of copying out
their secret internal data.

I have heard some evidence (in the context of a court case here in
Ireland) which would suggest that in fact smart-cards (specifically
those used in Satellite Pay-TV applications) *have* been successfully
scanned (using an Electron Microscope?), and cloned "somewhere in the
Far East"

Anybody else heard anything? If its true a lot of existing and potential 
Cryptologic applications will be affected.

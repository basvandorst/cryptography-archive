Speaking of blinders on, what the hell does that have to do with Clipper?
Clipper is not about Saddam Hussein's "privacy" but about the privacy of
citizens.  Perhaps if the government observed everyone every minute of
every day a few lives could be saved, but the price is simply too high.

That's a lousy reason to spy on everyone since anyone could conceivably
turn out to be a bad guy for all the government knows.

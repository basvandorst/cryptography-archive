The repeated bit patterns method (silly as it is) is exactly the reason
the exponent of a Mersenne (excuse my spelling) prime must be prime. These
are primes of the form:  M=2^P-1  which are just a string of P 1's in binary.
if you don't use a prime exponent you get trivial factorization. For example:

2^10-1 = 1111111111 = 11111*100001  because of the repeated 11111.
it also = 11*101010101

This stuff has been around for ages. Now I'm going to go to sleep and make
some more illegal copies of my "patented genes". (yes, it's being done)

Yeah that's what it sounds like to me.

And although I've heard of key-autokey and ciphertext-autokey
encryptors, I don't think I've heard of a plaintext-autokey
mode being used.

Offhand, plaintext-autokey would be pretty weak
because patterns in the plaintext will cause patterns
in the ciphertext regardless of the strength of the 
encryption function.

However, perhaps the originator of this thread has
some trick that is not apparent, and that he isn't telling
us about, that makes it secure.

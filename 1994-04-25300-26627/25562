      I saw an add in Compuserve Magazine regarding ViaCrypt PGP
   and I have some questions:

      Has anyone tried it?
      If yes, how does the front end for CIS work?

ViaCrypt now has a number of PGP products out.  Their original product was
binary-only PGP, with the RSA routines replaced by a licensed implementation,
money paid to Ascom Tech to keep them happy about the IDEA patent,
a bit of the documentation left out, and a nicely printed manual which
is a slight modification of the original PGP docs.  Cost $100+shipping+tax.

They've now also got $149 Unix versions for SunOS, SCO 386/486, 
IBM AIX RS/6000, HP 9000 700/800 UX, and are working on a Mac version.
Current DOS ViaCrypt users can upgrade for half-price.

The new product Chris is asking about runs on Windows and integrates
with the Compuserve WinCIM/CSNav friendly GUI interface.  Costs $119+,
current DOS ViaCrypt users can upgrade for $19.98.  Since I'm not a
CompuServe user, and it only works with the CompuServe programs,
(and therefore presumably only works with CompuServe) I haven't bought it,
but it claims to integrate seamlessly without forcing you to leave the
programs.  "Available April".

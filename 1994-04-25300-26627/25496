Just a question:         

     What sorts of information are of most use to an investigation
by police/national security?  Is it the FACT that A called B, or
WHAT A and B said, that is more important?

     If the former, would there be any privacy loss resulting from
the use of an encryption scheme that identifies WHO is talking
to WHOM, and for how long, and where they were when they talked, 
BUT that doesn't allow decryption of the content of the conversation
between the two parties?

     In other words, would such a system be a satisfactory compromise
between the legitimate concerns of national security and privacy?
Would it satisfy either set of interests (i.e., security or 
privacy), both or neither?

     I ask only because the only schemes I ever read about on
these groups are those that either do or do-not allow 
policing agencies to decrypt the content of a conversation/
data transmission.  Although alternatives may have been 
discussed, I have not (personally) seen a suggestion such as
that I've outlined above (though, I'm sure someone's though
t of it before).  

     What are the major problems with such a scheme (no
content without consent...but knowledge about the FACT of the
conversation being available to police without consent).

Regards, 

Paul

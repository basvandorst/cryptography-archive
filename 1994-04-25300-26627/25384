I am looking for reviews of hardware encryption cards for the IBM PC
series of computers.
I am particularly interested in the techniques used.  Is it only the
FAT that is controlled, does the control disappear when the card is
removed?  Are the files actually encrypted or just a simple password
access implemented?
Thanks for any pointers.

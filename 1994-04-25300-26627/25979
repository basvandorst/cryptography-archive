  This comment shows a basic failure to understand what "rights" are.

  "Rights" are types of conduct from which no person may legitimately
forcibly deny to another, except when necessary to prevent conduct which
is itself a violation of rights.
  Not having the financial (or other means) to excersize a given right at
the moment has nothing to do with *having* the right.  For example, I
still have a right to keep and bear arms even if I don't have the money to
buy a gun.

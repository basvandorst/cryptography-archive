Biham and Shamir state in 'D C of the DES' that knowledge of the S-boxes
is
necessary in order to perform differential attacks.  This is due to the
fact
that knowledge of the probabilities of different characteristics is
needed for the attack, and these must be computed from the S-boxes.  I'm
sure there are exceptions, though.

You're asking for trouble - kicking the NSA in sci.crypt!  Your name is now
on the list as an anti-American agitator.  Or are you really working for
the NSA trying to root out possible trouble-makers to keep a file on? Or
perhaps you're working for a third party --SPECTRE perhaps?  We have ways
of making you talk.  One of my favorite books is Lem's 'Memoirs Found in a
Bathtub'- it's the plates, get it?  This message is in code.

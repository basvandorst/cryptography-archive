One thing I have never understood about using the ``many worlds''
inperpretation this way is why anyone suggests suicide for the failing
cases. In the case of factoring numbers, one could simply try another
candidate instead of blowing up the nuclear weapon stockpile, and in the
case of betting everything and losing, just go on welfare.

Whether or not you kill yourself has no bearing in the universe where you
actually were successful.

I even gave some statistical data to Colin a few months ago that
showed how one could even identify the compression scheme used
pretty quickly, just by a spectral analysis of the compressed stream --
no knowledge of the input stream  is needed (as long as it contains
some redundancy, naturally).

Even arithmetic coding, probably the algorithm with the highest
compression rate over an unpredictable symbol source, produces
grossly less random output than even simple-minded encryption
algorithms.

I suppose the problem was to crack the last part of the code. The message
which the RSA had encrypted. I think that it took time for the crackers to
figure out that 01=A, 02=B, 03=C etc in the message THE MAGIC WORDS ARE 
SQUEAMISH OSSIFRAGE. :-) :-) :-)

	CONGRATULATIONS to everyone who made the RSA-129 project a
	success!

[a good alternative for the rng]

Ok, I think your suggestion of changing just the values that participate
in the generation of the presently returned value is better than changing
the whole darned generator per value.

I haven't digested SPINDLE yet but will when I get the chance, or I'll
yell for help.

I understand the avoidance of division, and in working code, this is what
should be done.  (Actually, left to myself, I would code it in MASM, and
yes, I would add and compare and adjust to bounds by subtracting 
the rotor length when out of bounds, instead of dividing). But I suppose I 
gotta live with C.  But while we're working out the details, would you
consider leaving the mods in, just to keep the pseudocode as uncluttered
as possible?  Anyway, I'm easy.

Naively, I don't think generating longs is weak.  All other things being
equal, it should be the same.  But I want to hold out for a byte generator.
We are discussing rngs, I know, Heaven forbid we talk about crypto!  But
should some misguided soul try to use this for crypto, he might appreciate
a byte generator instead of a block generator.  I did program a block
encryption system once, and I find block ciphers a little tricky to use
when the plaintext length is not a multiple of the block length.  Most
implementations of the DES are forced to do queer things to handle the
last short block.  The idea is, we want to preserve the original length of
plaintext string.  Imagine encrypting selected fields in a data base.
So, we can do it with block ciphers, but not as simply as with a stream
cipher.  Would you be willing to continue with byte rngs?

Finally, I agree, a long long period can be handy.  I got an idea for a
using a long period that I would like to post later.

BTW, several folks have mailed me encouragement.  Thanks greatly.

: >Is there some sort of prize from RSADSI for this?

: A prize was offered when the original challenge was published in 
: Scientific American in 1977. I think it's $100. If it's distributed among 
: all the folks who contributed cycles, they might get a penny apiece.


Actually, just roughly counting the number of workstations which 
contributed to the project each would get about sixteen cents.  A little 
better than a penny.  :)

This was actually discussed in many postings, over in
talk.politics.crypto and comp.org.eff.talk, which are more appropriate
places than sci.crypt for discussion of politics and implications of
policy.

I just checked talk.politics.crypto, and my site has already removed
these threads. "RISKS" covered this as well (cf. comp.risks, and then
locate the archive site for past posts). The author of the speculation
about Ames and Clipper discussed the matter in more detail and
responded to criticisms by Dorothy Denning and others.

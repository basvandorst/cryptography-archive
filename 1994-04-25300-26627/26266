The NSA hasn't had a spy scandal in many years. One would expect them to be
VERY careful in what they reveal to other agencies who have. In particular,
I'd think the Skipjack algorithm would be very tightly compartmented even
within the NSA. As for the key escrow data base, few chips had been keyed
(maybe none) during the time Ames was working for the Sovs/Russians, and
he'd been under surveillance during the recent period when chips were
starting to be keyed, and on ice in a relatively low-access job while the
FBI built their case, according to press reports.

No, the article was an example of irresponsible journalism, since the
"rumor", if not made up out of whole cloth by the paper, is illogical on its
face. Irresponsible media often make up stuff and attribute it to "rumors".
Sometimes this is done to make their product more colorful, and sometimes
just because they need something to fill space.  Responsible media do not
publish rumors, and require two or three sources for what they do publish.

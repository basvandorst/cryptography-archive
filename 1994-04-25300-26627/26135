I need some pointers to information about bypassing the password
protection set on Word (2.0c) For Windows documents.  A co-worker
died suddenly last month and we have no way of recovering the
contents of her documents without some way to decrypt or bypass
the password protection on the documents.

I called Microsoft and they were no help.  First they told me it 
couldn't be done.  Then they told me it was against the law, then
they told me it was against their policy.

Any pointers to decryption tools, text, or algorithms they may help
me would be appreciated.  (I read many FAQs searching for possible pointers.)

I don't read USENET news that often, so please EMAIL your suggestions
to me at:

	al676@cleveland.freenet.edu

and I will post a summary or the responses at a later date.


Thanks for your help.

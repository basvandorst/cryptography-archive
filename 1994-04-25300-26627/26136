You are forgetting the other 'hidden' functions that clipper has;
the ability to provide automatic traffic analysis of all of your
phone calls, financial transactions made electronically and, if
they are installed in cable tv boxes, what pay per view material
you have ordered. 
This is unnaceptable.
If the us gov. uses public money to invest in an encryption system
to protect the publics communications, they should have only the
publics interests at the center of the project. With clipper, the
publics privacy (which is what encryption is _for_) is secondary
to the 'law enforcement' agenda, and as such, is behaviour more
suited to other types of government. This is why an executive
order was used to launch the initiative, so that no debate could be
entered into on any level. You might remember that executive
orders are usualy employed in emergency situations ie war.
PGP is currently only being employed by a crypto concious group
that is small compared to the mass of telephone users. There is
absolutely no reason why everyone that uses a telephone should not
be  be afforded the same 100% security that PGP users enjoy, as a
matter of everyday fact.

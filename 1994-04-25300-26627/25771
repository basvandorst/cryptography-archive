I'm not thrilled about the errors, either.  But the errata is as public as
I can make it, and there are at least three professors using it as a taxt
this semester.

I agree that the stream cipher section is weak (I said as much in my preface),
but disagree with the "recent advances in generalized feedback shift
registers."

I guess.  I just pulled a bunch of crypto books off my shelves, and most of
them did footnotes the way I did, including Simmons's Contemporary
Cryptology, Brassard's Modern Crytology, and ALL of the Crypto and 
Eurocrypt proceedings.  (For the record, emdedding all that information in
the text would havae increased the length of the book by at least twenty
pages--no fooling.  I was already way over my page length, and my editor
would have had my head.  I think it was better to put more text in the book
than to use a verbose footnoting style.)

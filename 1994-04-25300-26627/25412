I've seen a similar program for DOS, called PGE. Hmm, Phill's gonna get 
upset :) It looked pretty simple to me, but if all you want is add your 
encrypted messages to a GIF or JPEG file while leaving the picture as it 
was, it does the job. The program was in wuarchive .wustl.edu, directory
/pub/MSDOS_UPLOADS/cyberpunk last time I checked. Oh BTW, the author 
signing as Roche'Crypt is totally unrelated to my last name :)

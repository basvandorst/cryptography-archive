i)  You can always boot a PC from a floppy disk, containing DOS & an
    antivirus.  (Yes, EXE_bug can still be present on PCs with an AMI
    BIOS, but the antivirus can detect & disinfect it).

ii) Most PCs have a sensible default for CMOS data, and often tools to
    help select the best settings.

They can infect/replace OS updates.

Fair enough, but this is not the default behaviour and requires deliberate
selection of the user.  I expect it also interfers with some apps that
expect this to happen?

Nobody's offered to lend me one, but I have chatted to users and read a
couple of books.

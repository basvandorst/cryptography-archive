	In a similar vein, how good are the following at creating random
numbers, both small and large numbers of them...

A)  Timing on someone's keystrokes?

B)  The system clock in milli seconds, as a seed for a "good" random number
generator?

C)  The least significant bit on the microphone input (assuming the machine
has a mike and that the rate of taking the LSB is less then the sampling
rate, and then treating the resulting bit as an unfair but consistant coin)


	Also, has anyone made a "real world" chip that say uses electron
tunneling to produce random bits?

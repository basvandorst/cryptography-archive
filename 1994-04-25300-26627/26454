I don't know about the fractal encoding per se, but I have been hearing
about some work regarding the use of strange attractor sequences to do the
encoding/decode.  The basic sequence being to use a sequence of values that
are generated by a strange attractor equation set, and then do the encode/
decode using the bit stream generated.  And since you have to have the
starting point for the equation, this is the secret that is passwd between
the two sites.

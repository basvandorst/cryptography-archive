	That was my point. It's interesting since apparently
the anti-clipper forces are resorting to rumormongering in the
trade press. It does illustrate a risk, namely that when you're
operating in secret, it's very easy for someone to bring fear,
uncertainty, and doubt to bear on your actions. Information
warfare 101.

	I guess the rumormongering works both ways; one man's
"Russian spy threat" is another man's "drug dealers, terrorists,
and child pornographers."

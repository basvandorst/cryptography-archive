That is, unfortunately, not enough. Unix is such a system, yet Unix
viruses are perfectly possible and several exist.

With *all* files writable (or chmod-able to writable state) by this
user. As I explained in another message of mine, this is enough for a
virus to spread.

Isn't that a Bell-LaPadula-based system? Well, viruses for such
systems are still possible, as Dr. Fred Cohen has demonstrated. Yes,
you can't write down, but you can still write up and in the same
security ring, therefore you can still infect some users/objects.

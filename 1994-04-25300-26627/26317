Check this. Does it apply to 'munitions' in the case of ITAR?

He isn't.

Phil is being prosecuted regarding allegations that he illegally
 exported 'munitions' in the sense of ITAR, i.e. in this case
cryptographic technology with respect to his PGP program.
Are you saying that ITAR is irrelevant with regard to things
in the public domain?
PGP is not in Public domain in any case, just freely available
to the public.  PGP is copyrighted and in fact uses technology
such as the RSA algorithm for which others claim patents (which
introduces possible patent infringement as yet another issue) and
the IDEA algorithm (with limited-use authorization) that is in
fact owned by a Swiss company.

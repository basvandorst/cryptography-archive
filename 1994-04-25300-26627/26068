CBC protects against identical plaintext blocks producing
identical ciphertext, and can protect against re-play attacks.
It does not protect against exhaustive search of the keyspace.
 
given the ciphertext blocks C[0],C[1],C[2],C[3]...  where
C[0]=initialization vector, we know the plaintext,
     P[i]= (decryption of C[i]) xor C[i-1].  
The only additional work the attacker has to do is xor by the
previous ciphertext block which is trivial.

If IV=C[0] is kept secret, this only gives additional
protection to the first block, C[1].  Also, since the IV has
to be different for each message, it is much harder to manage
than a single secret key.

As I argued in another thread a little while ago, if the
attacker has some knowledge about the plaintext, such as that
the high bit of each byte will always be 0, then the exhaustive
attack is only several percent more expensive than the same
attack on known plaintext.  The brute-force machines proposed
in the literature assume known plaintext to make the results
easier to follow, and since that is enough to show that DES is
weak.  They are not actually designing such machines as useful
products.

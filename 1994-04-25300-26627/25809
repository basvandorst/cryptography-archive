Hi all... Happened to be channel surfin' this AM and ran into a movie
called SNEAKERS (not too old) -- I'd seen it before, but was tired of
surfin' so I figured I'd watch for a bit... It occured to me during the
movie that the basic theme in this movie (a magic decoder box made by
NSA which would work on anything in the US) had overtones similar to
Clipper...

I've got some 'non-technoid' friends who just can't understand Clipper
-- they're watching the movie now, and I'd expect that they'd be pretty
upset by the end of it... might make for interesting viewing out
there...

Catch ya l8r!

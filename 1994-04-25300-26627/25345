I have received further information RE: my origional post.

quoting from David R. Arneke (with permission):

"The scrambling algorithim uses split-band frequency inversion, translation
of the upper band's frequencies, frequency dispersion of both bands, time
compression of both bands, and independant time displacement of the
individual bands."

Furthermore,

"The combinations are determined by a key generator driven by a common key
that is negotiated for each privacy activation by using a public key
technique.  This is the strongest scrambling algorithim available for
handheld, transportable, and mobile cellular subscriber equipment."

Also note that the press release about the system that I saw was dated
1/93, so the Clipper/Capstone angle is pretty much ruled out.  My
interpretation of the AT+T agreement to produce phones using Clipper was
that they were of a secure land-locked (wired) variety, not cellular. 
'course, I've been wrong before.....

[I didn't read the original message, so I may be all wet here...]
Or they could just send the LEF block, still encrypted, to the
feds, and have them open it, extract the ID, lookup the keys,
and send those back.

Yes...

Why?  I'm not saying they wouldn't, but they could just put a tape
recorder on the scrambled line, and when the keys come in they could
decrypt off the tape.

See my previous comment.

I don't know what's been said by "official" sources, but there is no
need for widespread LEAF decryptors, nor is there reason for law
enforcement to make unauthorized taps just to avoid time lags in
the key recovery, unless real-time recovery of plaintext is considered
to be *real* important; but that would probably imply that the time
lag of getting a judge to issue a warrant for the wiretap in the
first place would have been too much anyway.

     In one of the recent sci. Americans I read that one of the early
   versions of public key encryption had been broken... Given PGP is more
   advanced, but is it secure?  Can someone relay stats on the time
   necessary to crack PGP(2.3A) with key lengths of casual (256)
   commercial (512) and military (1024)


256 bits is trivial -- a day or two on a single workstation or a
high-end PC.  Call it 0.1 mips-years.

PGP's casual grade is actually 384 bits.  One this size requires
perhaps 100 mips-years.  384-bit numbers are routinely (but
infrequently) factorized by the likes of Lenstra&Manasse and
Silverman.  RSA-129, now in its final throes, is 425 bits and has
taken 4000 mips years with an algorithm known not to be the best we
can do.

512 bits is feasible for well-equipped organizations; Microsoft or HP
or ATT or Barclay's Bank or, ...  could do it if they really wanted
to.  It should take order 20000 mips years.  That is otherwise unused
time of their thousands of machines for a year.

1024 bits is apparently infeasible at present, even for organizations
like NSA/GCHQ/...  and is likely to remain that way for a few decades.


All these estimates assume that no breakthrough in factoring is
discovered.

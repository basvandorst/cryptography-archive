I will admit that under Natural Law you are an expert on the subject of lying.

Otherwise, Sternlight, you are just a sesquipedalian dunce.

Too bad you are tiring of teaching the rat Ignatius the catechism,
your foolishness is a warning light for others on the danger of pride
and syncophanty.

On the other hand, to be highly educated, but stupid, is a farcical
achievement that may inspire yet another Moliere to chronicle your life,
such as it was.

Bill Bennett the drug czar?  What a maroon.  I'd suggest Zippy the Pinhead to
you -- you might as well loosen up as you parade the asses' head.


Y'all come back and speak plain anytime y'all want, Sterno.  You are
always good for a gut laugh.  Your comments are so much hilarious
electronic toilet paper.

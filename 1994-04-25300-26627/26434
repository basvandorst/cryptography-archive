Hoo-ah!  Now there's the pot calling the kettle black!  'scuse me Mr.
Sternlight, but you are right that I am not trained as a philosopher --- I
am a computer scientist.  Now should that keep me from speaking about
philosophical issues?  Of course not.  Your total lack of training in
computer science hasn't stopped you from attempting to discuss some
issues related to that area --- including incredibly stupid comments
about your misguided notion of "what a parallel computer is and isn't"
to your lack of understanding about exponential vs. polynomial time
growth that came up when discussing brute force attacks.  [Aside: I
ignored those comments in the past, and have very, very rarely stooped
to the level of personal attacks in Usenet --- what is it about you
that brings that out of people?  And in fact, I will point out that you
contantly whine about how everyone is making personal attacks on you
rather than sticking to the issues (poor David...), and you throw the
first flame here --- another instance of wanting your rules to apply
only to *other* people, I'm sure.]

Now as for the topic of the current discussion, here's another definition
from Wester:  "Natural Law: unchanging moral principles common to all 
people by virtue of their nature as human beings."  You have been talking
about this as if it were a well-defined thing.  So you know *THE*ANSWERS*
about what what is moral and what isn't?  All hail the god-like powers of
David Sternlight!  If it were so easy, there wouldn't be philosophers.  
People have been debating about what is right and wrong for a long time,
with people espousing very different, and even opposing, views.  The
ancient Greeks debated about absolute vs. relative truths.  Have you
resolved this question for us?  Praise be!

Well thank you David Sternlight for clearing up these sticky philosophical
points for us, and drawing the conclusion that we have no moral basis
for privacy (and hence secure, non-escrowed, private encryption).  In
my philosophy, the rights of the individual are paramount --- this
includes the right to speak to whomever I want to, to say whatever I
want to, protecting such conversation from eavesdropping from *anyone*
else (including the government), by whatever means I choose.  Now will
you tell me that my philosophy is invalid, and please elaborate on
where my obviously mis-guided philosophy goes wrong?  :-)

Ah yes, Bill Bennett.  Now there's a role model for all Americans (choke,
gag, sputter)...

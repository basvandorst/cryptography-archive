Thanks for those who sent me copies of Schneier's Errata.

The sheer number of corrections indicates the book was not well
edited or proofread and rushed to press, makes it difficult to read,
and hence impractical for use as a textbook in the first edition.

There are number of serious omissions as well.  For example the
material about linear feedback shift registers (LSFRs) is dated
and completely ignores recent advances in generalized feedback
shift registers as early as 1990 which show Marsaglia, among others,
were mistaken in gross assertions about such algorithms and 
completely vindicates and hence shows the immense use of such
pseudorandom number generators (read value instead of use).

There are also some mistakes in the stream cipher sections, too
complicated to go into now, which follow from exclusion of LSFR
stuff above.

The bibliographical citations would be more valuable if the more
standard science writing convention of author's last name and year
were used for cites imbedded in the text.  Knuth or Otto Neugebauer
(History of Ancient Mathematical Astronomy, Springer-Verlag) are
two good examples of how scholars do it correctly.

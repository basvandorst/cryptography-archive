The following text is copied from Dr. Dobb's Developer Update,
Vol. 1 No. 1 March 1994.

	Crypto Chip Debuts
	National Semiconductor has released the iPower
	encryption chip, which is designed for use in
	PCMCIA cards and provides a range of security
	features.  The chip can encrypt data via multiple
	encryption algorithms, and will self-destruct upon
	any tampering attempt, using a self-contained
	chemical.  Cards that use the iPower chip can also
	provide additional functions such as tracking user
	access times.  The iPower division is based is (sic)
	Santa Clara, CA. 408 721-8797.


Has anybody heard anything else about this product?  What encryption
algorithms does it use?  And why is it necessary for it to contain a
self-destruct chemical?

The following are my guesses about what this chip contains:

	1.  It contains a form of "secret key".  This is why the
	    chip needs to be tamper-proofed.
	2.  The encryption algorithm could be proprietary.  Aside
	    from encryption, the algorithm(s) inside the chip also
	    perform signing (digital signatures).
	3.  With a built-in clock/timer, it performs time-stamping,
	    i.e., it can sign a block of data using its secret key.

My questions on it:

	1.  If the PCMCIA card is moved from machine to machine,
	    how does it ascertain that it is not connected to
	    a hostile computer?

Anybody with a few answers?

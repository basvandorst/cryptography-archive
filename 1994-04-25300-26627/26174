You present this like it's a new idea, but people have known about and
talked about this for a very long time...  (and it seems to come up about
yearly on the net).  I think there were even some references to similar stuff 
posted here not too long ago.

The problem is that there is not such thing as a "perfect compressor".
I saw you were talking about Huffman trees in your posting, but you have
to be *very* careful about your model.  In particular, if you are using an
order-0 (some people would call this order-1) model, then the single bits
coming out of a Huffman code based compressor will look random.  HOWEVER,
there is still a *LOT* of non-random correlation in the file.  In particular,
the distribution of 16 bit strings will be *very* non-random, and can be
used to break such a code fairly easily.

So you might counter with:  "So I'll use a higher order model".  Fine -- the
problem is still there, but it's more subtle now.  Bottom line:  people have
looked at this and decided it wasn't worthwile...  Use compression algorithms
for compression, and encryption algorithms for encryption.

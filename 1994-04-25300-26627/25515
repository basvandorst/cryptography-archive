    Ok, how about using a 24-bit picture?  This allows for 16 million 
colors, which is about five times what the eye can see.  "Well, gee 
officer, of course there is two or three of each color..."  Again, if you 
encrypted the data before encoding it, the pattern of which bit got 
chosen would be observably completely random, thus you couldn't even 
prove that there was a message.

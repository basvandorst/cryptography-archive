1. It's not clear what's meant by "noncommercial use"---does using IDEA
to encrypt business-related files or messages count as commercial use?
The GPL is carefully designed to permit this kind of use, so if using
IDEA this way isn't allowed, then an IDEA-using program wouldn't be
as widely useful as a non-IDEA GPL'd program.

2. There are lots of good DES implementations available outside the
US, some written here, others not.  It's not a problem.  It's true
that using triple DES would be slower than IDEA.

3. MDC is a stream cipher invented by Peter Gutmann, based on the
US NIST Secure Hash Algorithm and used in Peter's SFS program.
It's free and unpatented, and sources are available.  It looks
to be as secure as SHA itself, though this hasn't been proven as
far as I know.  It does use a lot more key material than DES or IDEA,
which probably helps.  It's also faster than either, I believe.

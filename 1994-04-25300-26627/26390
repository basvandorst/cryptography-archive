Why does everyone seem to assume SHA has been "broken"?  From the text of 
the announcement, it seems more like they've found a problem of a severity 
level along the lines of the pseudocollisions in MD5.  Or, as I suggested to 
the person who originally mailed me the release, perhaps the only weakness 
in SHA is that it's too easy to turn into a CFB-mode encryption algorithm.
 
It'll be interesting to see what the implications are for Capstone, which 
implements SHA in an ARM CPU core - will existing chips be recalled?  How 
long will the redesign take?  What will happen to FIPS 180, and existing 
products implementing it?
 
Peter.

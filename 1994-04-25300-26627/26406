Another uh, er, umm, incompletely educated reader. One of the seminal works
in this domain is Rousseau's "Contrat Social".

My Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary lists "socal contract" but does not
list "social compact". The usage has been around since 1849.

It's true that social compact is sometimes used, but you are badly in error
to say it's NOT contract.

You deserve an even sharper response because of your use of offense as a
substitute for knowledge via "if you are going to be silly", but I'll
content myself with pointing out that it's a bad idea to exacerbate one's
ignorance with the deliberate giving of offense.

Data security represents an inherent issue to any data base design
either centralized or distributed.

My questions are : 

What cryptographic technique is used for intersite data communication
in R*, a prototype distributed database management system developed
by IBM ?? R* sites communicate using the SNA LU6 protocol.

SDD-1, a prototype distributed database was developed by the Computer
Corporation of America. In this case RelNet provides the reliable
intersite communication. In SDD-1 implementation, ARPANET is the lowest
level of RelNet which is used for basic message transmission facilities.
What Cryptographic technique is used for data security in this system ??

In the case of distributed Ingres, Ingres/Net is the communication link
between nodes. What cryptographic technique does Ingres/Net make use of
for data security in Ingres/Star ??

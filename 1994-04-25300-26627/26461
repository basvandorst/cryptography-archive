What this means, is that *one* *single* *possible* 
RSA key of some 429 bits has been factored. If someone
expended this effort yet again, they could crack
*one* other possible RSA key of some 429 bits.

RSA can use innumerable different keys. One medium one
has been broken. Do your self a favor and do not put
in "429" when PGP asks how long you want your key to
be. That way, it won't somehow pick one that's been
factored.

The algorythem is still working, and secure. 

*sheesh.*

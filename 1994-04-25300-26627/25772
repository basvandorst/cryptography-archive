While it has not been conclusively established, there is still reason to
believe that the highest levels of US government did know of the Pearl
Harbor plans, and let the attack happen as a way of bringing the US into
the war.  They may not have had good intelligence on the size of the attack
and the amount of destruction it would cause [presumably because this
information was not transmitted, even in encrypted form].

In any event, how would US escrowed keys have prevented this?  Are you
making the argument that the governments of the rest of the world are
dumb enough to encrypt messages with a system known to be readable by us?

The Purple and Enigma machines were pretty good crypto in their day.  I am
sure that Saddam's crypto is pretty good for today's needs.  In any event,
we can only use crypto to gain insights into Saddam's war plans if he is
stupid enough to conduct extended discussions of those plans in an
interceptable arena.

No, the Clipper system will have absolutely no effect on government (ANY
government) encryption of communications.  It will only have an effect on
private citizens (even corporations can and will use better stuff).  Are
you arguing that we need to prevent private citizens from invading Kuwait,
and that the potential damage caused by that possible attack is worth
denying privacy to all of us?

You are in the minority here. Many anti-Clipper types have already atttacked
some other jerk who announced he wouldn't respect people's copyrights in
their e-mail.

Someone tried posting an announcement before. To announce you plan to
violate a law does not get you off, nor does it make you honorable. Instead
it makes you a hoodlum and sociopath. the last guy who tried this with
respect to people's e-mail got a big fat razzberry here from several reders.
Is that what you want.

Posting a no trespassing sign is proper because it is the trespasser who is
violating the law. Posting a "I don't respect copyrights in people's e-mail"
sign is a confession of lawlessness on the part of the poster. If, in the
face of such a sign, someone sends you e-mail anyway and you post it, it is
you who are exposed to copyright violation charges, and your sign does not
in any way mitigate your violation.

As Joan Rivers is fond of saying, "Oh, grow up."

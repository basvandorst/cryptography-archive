Does being into bondage rule you out of the supreme court?!?  But, storage
is cheap enough that they (the infamous they) could store pretty much all
the email they capture for years and years.  Doesn't the NSA have a never
ending supply of money?


What if I was a card carring communist, or a suspected criminal.  Then they
might target me for "message storage".   (That sounds like the theme of a
bad spy novel.)

The encryption system is called Videocrypt, developped by News Datacom.

The whole system has not been broken, but the secret contents of the current
access card generation (issue 07) are now well known. There has even public
domain software (Season7 V1.1) for PCs (with src) been published on the USENET
recently that allows you to use a PC in order to emulate the Sky smart card and
watch all Sky programms without a subscription (this is currently even
legal in Germany). The "secret" card hash algorithm has already been posted 
about 2 weeks ago in this group.

The Videocrypt system itself is very secure as long as the algorithm in the
smart card is secure and secret. The card is replaced by the network
approx. once per year.

Hi!!

A few questions for all you knowledgable folk out there.... :

Does anyone know if Cyrptograpic or cypher software is available on CD-ROM
and if so from where??

Are there any restrictions on the availablility of such software on
CD-ROM??

What sort of material would *YOU* want to see on such a CD-ROM??

Thanks in advance,

--I

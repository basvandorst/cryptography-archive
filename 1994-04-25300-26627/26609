Xenon, I like all your suggestions, but i don't think good, better,
best should be applied (since the attack would then only be applied
against the recommended "best" obfuscation).  The SFS docs cover lots
of the ways people obfuscate ordinary words to make passwords, if
applied non-uniformly to many words in a passphrase, they would go a
long way to make things very difficult.

I doubt that this would be very good recommendation by itself.  The
reason is, is that given a persons cultural heritage, and a few
specifics about a persons background, i do not believe their poetry
would be "original".  For some creative and learned individuals such
passphrases could be good, but for the majority of people poetry is
probably more restrictive than any grammatically correct phrase or
sentence.

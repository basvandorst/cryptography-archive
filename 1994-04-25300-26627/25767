It's is not going to keep anything secret.  The best attack I've found is
with known plaintext, which takes a few minutes to break on a 486 PC.
PKWare are allowed to export it, except for a few countries (such as
Libya, South Africa) - I've mislaid the net posting explaining this.

It encrypts a byte at a time, and the 3 32-bit Keys & 8 bit mask are updated
in 5 consecutive steps (including a 32-bit multiply by a constant).  This
is okay for s/w, but for fast h/w implementations it could be adapted for
parallel operation with no loss of security.

 Depending on your definition, I'll probably diagree with this. One of the
machines here is an Acorn Archimedes. It's OS is in ROM, you can't infect
it no matter what you do. It's possible to infect applications which the 
user doen't bother to protect, however this is common even among recognisedly
secure systems. I'd say a computer is virus-proof if, by taking reasonable
precautions, it cannot be infected passively. By this definition, there are 
several mainframe systems which are virus-proof, and at least this one 
personal system.

      In the add it mentioned that ViaCrypt has an "Interoperable version"
   of their software.  What does this mean?  

It interoperates with the Freeware PGP (at least, I assume this is what it
means)

      Is the "ViaCrypt" version significantly different from the public 
   domain PGP 2.3A?  If yes, how so?

The ViaCrypt version has their own RSA routines.  Other than that, and
a few minor bugfixes, it is the same as PGP 2.3a.

      Is ViaCrypt PGP shipping today?

Yes.

      What is ViaCrypt's upgrade policy?  

You'll have to ask them.

      Does ViaCrypt have any public key servers? 

No.  You can use the ones already available.

      Does ViaCrypt have any plans for creating a trusted network (hierchy) for key
      distribution and other services similar to notery services on paper today.

Again, you will ask them, although I doubt they plan to generate a
"Hierarchy".  PGP is a web-of-trust system, not a hierarchical system.
Anyone can become a Certifying Authority using PGP.

      Does the price for ViaCrypt only cover one license?

Yes (according to the glossies I have).  You can call for license
information for bigger orders.

      Does ViaCrypt support all of the features found in 2.3A like armored asci,
   conventional, signatures, etc?

Yes.  As I said, it is 2.3a with a different RSA engine.

      The add says the price for $119.98+sh+tx+etc.

That sounds about right.

64 bits is probably enough if you aren't concerned about long term 
protection of valuable data from an adversary with lots of computing 
power.  I didn't realize the key was limited to 64 bits, though.  Please 
forgive me for this error.

An NSA employee, who wishes to remain anonymous, told me so.  The same 
person also told me that the MPJ2 encryption algorithm was "Good!"  None 
of this was in writing, and none of this is official or in writing.  The 
NSA may deny this, and this unsigned message could be a forgery.  My 
reasons for believing that this person, who works for an agency whose job 
seems to me very much like hiring foxes to guard henhouses, was not 
engaging in a deception, are purely subjective and may possibly be in 
error.  Take this for what it is worth.

A better reason to trust the design of RC-2 and RC-4 is the reputations 
of the designers.  Nobody who has seen and analyzed the code for these 
algorithms has indicated an attack better than brute force, yet, although 
this is a small number of people, so far.

Personally, I wouldn't pay royalties to use RC-2 and RC-4, because there 
are free alternatives with similar or better security and performance.  
On the other hand, RSADSI has a temporary monopoly on public key 
encryption technology, so I would license that technology from them for a 
commercial project if the projected profits from that project justified 
that expenditure.

Take it for what it is worth...

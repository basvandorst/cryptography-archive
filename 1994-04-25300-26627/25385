This may very well be a question that has been asked before, and if so I 
apologise.

I was looking at the DES, and wondered if the initial and final permutations
actually have any effect on the strength of the cypher.  The (very limited)
analysis that I've done suggests that they don't but I have no proof either
way.  Does anyone (here) know why they were made part of the system in the
first place?

Another thought was using a longer key, and using seperate parts of it for
each round.  This would certainly make a brute force attack more difficult,
but could it also lead to the possibility of a large number of weak keys?

I'm not a expert, and any help would be appreciated.

What judge?  What court order?  Nothing in the Clipper Initiative requires either
of those when seeking disclosure of keys.  I don't know how that will strike the
good citizens of Peoria, but I agree it's a pretty glaring omission...by the
sponsors of the initiative.  Respect for the courts is irrelevant here, since the
courts have no role in authorizing the release of escrowed keys.

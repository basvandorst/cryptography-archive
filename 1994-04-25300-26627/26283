I have seen the use of hardware protection, and am curious as to how this
works.  I have looked around for information on it, but have not come
across anything.  I am interested in how it works and what makes it so
hard to bypass.  I have also seen ads in the back of magazines stating
that our hardware protection is resistent to reverse engineering, and is
binded with your program.  What makes this so resistent to bypassing
the protection, when everything else has been bypassed out on the market?
Thanks in advance.

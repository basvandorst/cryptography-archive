Could the pros out there please recommend a set of key reading to get up to
speed on crypto topics?  I will post a summary (e.g. Top Ten).

I have read Diffie & Hellman's original papers (had both as profs at Stanford).
 Also read a text on finite field theory.  Shannon's original paper.  Many
articles by Bruce Schneier (planning to get his new book).

Can anyone suggest a few more key writings?  Let's assume graduate-level grasp
of the maths and engineering/math/CS background.

Thanks, everybody

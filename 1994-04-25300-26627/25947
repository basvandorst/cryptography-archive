OUR rights?

Who WE, Mr. Arms Manufacturer?

It certainly doesn't entail giving up any of MY rights.

Speaking of my right to export nukes makes about
as much sense as speaking of my right to found
a university.  I have no such right.  In order to
have such a right, I would have to have some money. 
If I had the right, since it takes money, I would have
a right to the money.

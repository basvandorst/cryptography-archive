I thank all those who responded.

Your answers seem to confirm what I had suspected; namely that the text I was
reading was a bit overzealous in saying that n can be easily factored knowing
phi(n).  When one knows that n is the product of exactly 2 distinct primes,
this is of course easily, but it does not generalize.  (The text stated
as a theorem that n could be so factored.  It them omitted the proof of the
general case, and stated the proof only for this specific case.  It seemed
fishy to me.)

Some people posted probabalistic methods, but thought that deterministic
methods would be difficult to find; one writer told me that he didn't think
that any deterministic methods were known.  If anyone could confirm or deny
this, I'd be grateful.

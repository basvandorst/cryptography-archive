A chain is only as strong as its weakest link.  A one-time pad key is 
no more secure than its key source.  If you use a good block cipher to 
encrypt some selected file on your disk with some key you made up, and 
use the result as a one-time-pad key, then your system is approximately 
as secure as the block cipher, and the input you used to it (file and 
key), whichever is weaker.

If you use a real random source (i. e. measured physical phenomina), then 
your key generation cannot be repeated, even if someone knows how you did 
it.  If you DES encrypt command.com with the password "secret", and use 
that for your one time pad, someone might possibly guess what you did.

Peace to you.

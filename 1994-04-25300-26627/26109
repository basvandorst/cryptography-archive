Interesting.  Now, assuming your math is right, there ought to be ways
to find F(0) in less than 2^32 trials.  Since there are only three rounds,
I imagine that slightly different Rs don't lead to unrecognizably 
different Ls.  In other words, I'm suggesting another piecemeal attack
on F(0).

I know that in theory 2^32 trials is acceptable.  But in practice, I want
a less strenuous exercise.

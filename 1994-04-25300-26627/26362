Actually BSkyB and News Datacom always claimed that it was the algorithm 
that was the core security of the system. They also claimed that the 
algorithm used was based on a one way function. Then again they claimed 
a lot of things.
        Their crypto system was based on their, rather mistaken and naive
belief that their algorithm and smart cards could not be broken. The hack
occurred towards the end of 1992 and hit the market in April of 1993.
        There was very little if anything that Sky and News Datacom could
do to stop the hack apart from issuing new smart cards.
        The flaw in their system was that it essentially had a single 
layer
of authentication. The decoder passed a 32 byte packet to the card. This 
packet contained the channel identifier, the time stamping, the decryption
seed (in an encrypted format) and the access control information. Since 
the
hack, known as the "Ho Lee Fook" hack had cracked the algorithm and its 
code table, the whole system was compromised.
        In some respects this single layer system was good. The system was
designed in the mid eighties so it was a somewhat elegant compromise. The 
over the air data rate is very slow in the VideoCrypt system (1 Kilobaud)
and as a result the addressing of the smart cards is very limited. It 
works
on an exclusion basis rather than inclusion. A kill or blacklist signal 
is 
sent to switch off cards. With other more complex systems, a heart beat 
signal is sent so that the decoders are kept on. This is similar to the 
VideoCipher system in the USA and the EuroCrypt system in Europe.
        The problem for News Datacom and Sky is that the European Blackbox
industry is more powerful and perhaps far more cleverer than they had even
known. It is not the first time that people believed that they had created
an unbreakable system only to have it smashed utterly.
        Very few people know exactly what happened. As with most hacks in 
the Blackbox industry, it is the integration of information that allows a 
system to be hacked. The smart cards were probably reverse engineered and
this information, coupled with other information created the Ho Lee Fook.
        Smart cards should no longer be considered as being the ultimate
in security. If you have a badly designed crypto or scrambling system, it 
will be hacked. Sometimes it will be an individual hacker but as is more 
often the case, the hack will be the product of a number of people.

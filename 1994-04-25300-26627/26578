I don't know about the '67 vs '74 comment, but a friend of mine bought
a brand new copy, '74 edition I assume, from Quantum books.  Here's an
excerpt from an old Sci.crypt posting:

  You can order it from Quantum Books via e-mail (yes! via e-mail)
  at  quanbook@world.std.com  .  That's how I got mine.  It cost
  me $60 for the hardbound edition and an extra $3 for shipping,
  and you can use your credit card to order, too.

  Their phone/fax numbers are 617-494-5042/617-577-7282.  I hope
  this information is what you've been looking for...

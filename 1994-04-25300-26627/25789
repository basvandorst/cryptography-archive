Please let me know if you're serious. If you are I will kill file you, for
indicating that you don't plan to honor my copyright in my writings. Nothing
to do with privacy, about which there are no relevant laws. But there are
about copyright to one's personal mail, and publishing them without
permission is a violation. There have been court cases about this, and the
legal position is quite clean.  My policy is that nobody has the right to
publish my e-mail to them without prior written permission. Anything else is
a violation of the copyright laws. What's more, since such e-mail is not
offered for publication, there are no "fair use" extract provisions that
apply.

Thus if you are publicly announcing you have no respect for laws, there's no
point in further conversation with you based on the background of shared
practices of most of us in civilized society. If it was an attempt to be
cute, say so and we'll know you were making what is, given the history of
some on the net, a very bad joke.

David

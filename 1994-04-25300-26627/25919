  It can be trivially made so. The fact that most machines are owned by
schools and kids, who don't know anything about file permissions and 
access control, doesn't mean the machine doesn't have any. The virii written
for it are truly simplistic. They rely on the ignorance of the user about
some of the things the machine is configured to do automatically when it
sees an application. You don't have to do these things though.

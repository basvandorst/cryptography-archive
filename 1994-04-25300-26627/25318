Al, it takes two to Tango. A discussion is unlikely to be continued
if there is only one person engaged in it. If discussions involving
David get 'going far too long', it is unfair to blame David for it -
he's not the only one involved.  And if these several people care
to continue the discussion to such length, who are you to criticise
them for it. If you don't like it don't read it. Set the thread
to ignore or hit your return key.

You can dress it up anyway you want, but in my opinion your
'Douse Sternlight' message *is* an attempt to stifle discussion
(in which you need not even participate, nor even take notice)
and to silence opposing views.

I reiterate *my* position, which is that David is welcome and in
fact invited to contribute whatever *he* feels relevant to *any*
discussion *he* wishes. If I don't agree with, or perhaps like
what he says, I'm perfectly content to either refute it,
dispute it, or ignore it.

(BTW David, Kudos for making Grady's prolific postings list. Keep
up the good work!)

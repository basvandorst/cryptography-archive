I have a question about the feasibility of generating a secure one-time
pad via software only (without using A/D from some natural source).

What if I used a software randomizer to scramble a text file that only
I know?  (This would prevent the contents from being merely the result
of a mathematical pseudo-random computation).

Then, if that file were DES encrypted with a randomized key several
times in succession, what would the probability be that the attacker
could discover the sequence with only the encrypted text?

A related question: since a pseudo-random generated bitstream is based
on a mathematical computation that is repeatable, does a DES encrypted
image of such a bitstream also contain the same orderliness?  Is it
possible to write a program that will detect a DES encoded mathematical
series?

John

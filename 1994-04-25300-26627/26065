Bzzzzzzttttt....  wrong answer, but thanks for playing!  Clipper is *NOT*
a voice encryption chip --- it is a purely digital encryption system.  Clipper
*IS* designed for use in phones, but you have to add your own A/D and
voice compression to the front to produce a digital stream before it ever
sees Clipper.  Once the digital stream is produced you can encrypt however
you like --- most encryption schemes (hardware or software) can easily
keep up with the data rates needed for secure phones.

I also believe that Clipper is being planned for many other applications
in addition to phones.  I vaguely recall reading a while back about plans
for a PC network card that included Clipper (now where did I read that...)

That would require some thought as to security.  Since Windows can swap
tasks out to disk when necessary, there is a possibility that plaintext or
even keys might get written to a Windows swap file.  Undoubtedly, someone
has a utility that will "sanitize" the Windows swap file upon exiting
Windows, though.

Of course, that risk occurs on just about any multi-tasking or virtual
memory machine, and not just under Windows.

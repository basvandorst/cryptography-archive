Security in a system is only as good as the integrity checkers. True.

ROM it.

That way unless someone has hacked the ROM before or after
installation, you are safe. There is no known way a virus can hack a
ROM. EEPROM yes.

In practice, you'd better make sure that there is no way a virus can
intercede between the ROM and the applications also!

In a Unix kernel, make it part of the Kernel.

Better check the integrity of your compiler/linker before you run it
on your code...

-Ian.

p.s. anyone interested in security should probably read: acm
transactions on computer systems vol 10 no4 November 1992 pg265-310

It covers distributed authentication and security. It briefly mentions
the *easier* examples talked about here.

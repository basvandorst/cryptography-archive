The IBM TSS products offer just such an algorithm, which can be exported
without the restrictions required for DES.  The algorithm is called CDMF, for
"Commercial Data Masking Facility".  As a "black box", it looks exactly like
DES - same size and format of key, same data input/output, etc.  The
difference is that the effective key strength is 40 bits instead of 56.  This
is done in such a way that the 40 bits are distributed within a 56-bit key,
rather than simply setting 16 bits of a DES key to some constant values.  In
other words, all 56 bits are used and will change in different keys.

CDMF is available in mainframe, pc/workstation, and smart card products.

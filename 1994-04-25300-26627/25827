Not really.  The original point was that as much as the original poster
disliked gun control, he had to grant to "gun grabbers" that guns kill
people but crypto doesn't.  The clear and obvious inference is that the
legislation of gun control (as misguided as the author might see it) is an
attempt to control something that kills people.  This is not the case with
Clipper.

You provided examples of where crypto "kills", but, as I pointed out,
meaningless ones where legislation of crypto would have no impact (which is
understandable since one would be hard-pressed to construct probable
examples in which legislation of crypto could be demonstrated to save
lives).  The point was that drawing parallels between weapons (guns and
nuclear weapons) and crypto is flawed because while there is a sense of
urgency in controlling weapons (the downside of not doing so involves
deaths), this is not the case in the Clipper debate.

Hi!  In the sci.math FAQ there is a list of references of "formulas"
to calculate prime numbers.  Has anyone implemented any of these
formulas in C code or something?

I know there are "probably prime" generators; I'm not interested in
those.  I have one in the GNU MP library, anyways.

Thanks in advance!

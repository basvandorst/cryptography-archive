Summary: 
Keywords: 

	Since talk.politics.crypto is for the socio-political implications
of cryptography and cryptanalysis, and sci.crypt (meant for general
cryptology) is filled with poor posts, excessive flames, and other
word-salads, the creation of a group dedicated to cryptology and moderated
to facilitate effective use seems in order.
	The ability to exchange ideas with noted cryptologists,
cryptographers, and cryptanalysts obviously was the orginal intent of 
sci.crypt.  With the influx of disruptive, abusive, and inconsiderate 
users onto the Net this intent has been written over with off-topic 
conversation, flames, and poorly placed posts (the latter being possibly 
excusable).
	I support the creation of a moderated sci.crypt.theory or 
sci.crypt.research to provide the quality, informative discussions that 
should be in sci.crypt and talk.politics.crypto.

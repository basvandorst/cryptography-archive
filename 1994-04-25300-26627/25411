Actually, some shading has long been accepted.  What people don't like
here are *advertisements*.  One-way communication.  You are perfectly
welcome to talk about new products, but if you don't use attention-getting
techniques, leave out the marketing fluff, and answer questions, it's
a useful contribution.  If you post a content-free press release,
people will get annoyed.

I just read a 10-page glossy on NatSemi's iPower chip and I still
don't know what it does!  Hell, I'm not sure what applications it's
targeted for.  Is it a smart card for an untrusted host, or a processing
accelerator for a trusted one.  They talk like it's the former, but with
no secure channel to the user, I fail to see how it's of any use in that
role.  And I don't know what algorithms they propose, how programmable
by the end-user it is, if it's something to be sold to end users as is
or a sort of microcontroller for others to develop apps for, or anything
about the processor on board except "RISC" "32 bits" and "20 MHz".

That's the sort of useless attention-garnering that people don't like.
But as long as you have something to *inform* people about as opposed to
make them "feel good" about, it's probably welcome.  Heck, folks from
MIPS dominate many discussions in comp.arch, but I haven't heard any
noticeable resentment.

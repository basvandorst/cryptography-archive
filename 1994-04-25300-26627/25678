News clips from the Globe And Mail and Financial Post:

Jitec Corpoaration, a small privately-held computer company
in St-Hubert, Quebec has developed the world's first
virus-immune computer.

Jitec's line of Vectoria desktop computers have a patented
computer chip called EVAC (electronic virus activity control)
which detects the movement of viruses through a computer's
memory, rather than tracing their signatures.   Existing
anti-virus software can only find existing viruses, and
must be updated regularly to protect computers from new
viruses.  The Vectoria does not need updating because it
tracks viruses as they jump from one memory sector to
another in a computer's memory, acting as a filter to detect
and kill viruses.

Does anyone know more about Vectoria and how the EVAC technology works?

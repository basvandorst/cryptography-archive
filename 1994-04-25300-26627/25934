It involves three DES cycles, in encrypt-decrypt-encrypt order.
THe keys used may be either K1/K2/K3 or K1/K2/K1.  The latter is
sometimes caled "double-DES".  Combining two DES operations like this
requires twice as much work to break as one DES, and a lot more storage.
If you have the storage, it just adds one bit to the effective key size.

One 64-bit IV.  It's a block cipher, which you use in any of the
standard modes.  (People have suggested doing DES-CFB three times in
succession, byt Eli Biham has argued that this is weaker.)

It depends on what you call double-DES.  encrypt-encrypt has an
effective key size of 57 bits against brute force, which is not good.

No.  A good algorithm should be salted and involve iterated hashing
to slow down a dictionary attack.  MD5 will probably do fine.

There is no standard way.  Terry Ritter's proposed ladder-DES, which
uses DES as the f() function in a 4-round Feistel cipher system to
achieve 2 DES encryptions per 64-bit block is one suggestion that
seems pretty good.  But basically larger block sizes are a bad thing.
They make good avalanching harder to achieve, so you ned up needing
more rounds and making the whole thing more expensive.

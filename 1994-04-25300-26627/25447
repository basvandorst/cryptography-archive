I would support a moderated group. I would, however, be sad to see serious 
cryptologic/cryptanalytic discussion limited to a moderated .theory group.
This course is fine for (pure) maths and indeed there should be a considerable 
overlap between cryptologic theory and (other) mathemetical theory. But 
all good cryptology should not (cannot?) be divorced from associated 
technologic considerations. Without sound implementation, sound theory rests
on quicksand.

Does anyone else feel that cryptologic theory should remain harnessed to 
technologic reality (and let the devil take the politics :-) )?

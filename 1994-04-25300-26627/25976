  Gee, and I heard that Marxism was dead....

  After you name the incidents in which "the spending of the rich"* have
produced evils that even remotely compare to the abuses of government power
(e.g. the mass murders in Russia, Germany, Cambodia, etc, the mass
internments in various countries including the United States, imprisonment
for the crime of expressing unpopular opinions,... must I bore everyone by
continuing?), get back to us.  Until then, know that I for one see through
your blue smoke and mirrors.


     * "Spending of the rich" to purchase favorable uses of government
          power do not count, since such things could not happen unless
          the government power existed to *be* purchased.

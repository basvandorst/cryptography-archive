   There no such thing as hardware implementation of "reasonable"
crypto anymore.  Hardware only crypto has too many practical problems
to be considered reasonable.  When the hardware becomes vulnerable,
for whatever reason--practical cryptography, reverse engineering,
advances in mathematical theory, advances in processor speeds--you
MUST trash the hardware.  But I know of NO case of that ever
happening.  Even when the avionics, etc. of an aircraft are upgraded,
interoperability rears its ugly head.

More likely, 
  1) such a massive nationwide surveillance effort would probably
     not happen at one central location, but rather at say 100 or so
     listening posts.  Each would accumulate only a few hundred tapes/day.
  2) There are higher density media than Exabytes nowadays, e.g. I think
     DEC sells some kind of cartridge drive that stores 20+ gigabytes on
     a TK50-like cartridge.

When they start investigating you for oppposing Clipper or buying
grow lamps for your indoor tomato plants, and decide they want to
listen to your last N years of phone calls.

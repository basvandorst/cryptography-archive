There was nothing incivil about it. I neither called names nor imputed
motives. What I said was that there was no evidence of careful checking.

To this day, months later, CPSR has still failed to announce that the
signatures claimed were validated through any kind of reliable checking. I
remain convinced they did a sloppy job and then tried to brazen it out when
challenged. However I don't impute bad motives to them--just sloppiness and
a refusal to face criticism.

I note with some interest that some of the CPSR parties involved have now
left CPSR to run their own organization. The announcement is unclear on the
dynamics involved in precipitating the separation, and the events
surrounding the CPSR petition may be entirely unrelated.

It would be good if you, and some specific others could learn the difference
between valid criticism and incivility, since some here seem to think one
needs to be incivil to express disagrement. I think that to be a vestige of
an earlier, more primitive stage of development.

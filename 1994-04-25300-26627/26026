Un-crackable?  Is there such a thing?

Of course, there are lots of ways to use the real random data to seed a 
block cipher or hash function to generate some pretty high quality 
pseudorandom data, especially with an expansion rate as low as your 
example.  Of course, the higher the expansion rate, the more the security 
of the output begins to depend on the block cipher or hash function you 
are using and the method you are using to expand the data.

One simple approach to "double" your data would be to encrypt your input 
file with a key generated randomly, and append the output to the input 
file, then destroy the key you used to generate the output.  There are 
probably better ways, but it kind of depends on the application...

Peace to you.

Recently, I uploaded PGP to a local, 5 line BBS.  A few weeks later, a news
item was posted, displaying that the use of PGP on the BBS was forbidden.  Is
this a legal action taken by the sysop?  Is he allowed to ban a software that
is legal?  Also, the sysop mentioned that it was for legal reasons he was
doing it..can this be true?  What kind of legal consequences could he be
getting from people using PGP on his board?  Please respond, ASAP..

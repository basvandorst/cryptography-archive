Are AT&T not using the Clipper chip: a chip that keeps information
unintelligable to all except the two parties speaking plus
any police agency that cares to bug the conversation?  I don't
see why they would not be using that controversial chip unless
it is not yet under production.  I offer this suggestion without
any official knowledge that AT&T are in fact using the chip
in those phones, but I recall reading recently that they will
be cooperating with American police and spy agencies by using
the government-prone Clipper chip in their telephones.  Hopefully
I'm wrong, and they've used something that keeps one's telephone
calls private, even with respect to big brother.

If I am not wrong, does anybody here know which telephone
manufacturers are indeed using strong, government-proof, 
encryption chips?  I'd much rather have such a brand of
telephone, as I don't believe that the government has any
need to listen to everyone's conversations...they work FOR
us, for Pete's sake.

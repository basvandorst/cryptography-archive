By no means has it been "vastly overrated," even at your ... creative
... "NSA to real-world" conversion ratios.  I have this tremendous
sense of disconnect here; I was advised (am I the only one who ever
read or heard this?) that a 384-bit key was merely "casual" security,
512 was "commercial" grade, and 1024 was "military."  I think the
present factoring fits those characterizations quite well - I would
never expect anything called "casual" to defend against the concerted
might of a US Government organization - that would take something more
like "military," which even by the most pessimistic estimates posted
in this discussion is still proof against the NSA chimera for a while
longer.

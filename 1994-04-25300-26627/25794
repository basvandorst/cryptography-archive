  Keep in mind that many people read the newsgroups via BBS's connected
through gateways.  The board I get this through is CRS Online, which 
has at least 10,000 user's, who can access the group, without any direct
subscription.  Since many of those people, are lurkers like myself, you
would have a hard time getting a realistic number.

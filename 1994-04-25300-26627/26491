My goodness. I hit the Jackpot. After Steve Brinich's message, here we have
another one engaging his mouth before his brain is in gear.

My "total lack of training in computer science" consists in part of the
following:

I first took computer science courses as an undergraduate at MIT in 1952.

I worked on some of the first large-scale computers.

I wrote the first program for aircraft simulation for the predecessor of
NASA, the Wright Air Development Center.

I wrote part of Fortran for IBM.

I worked on one of the largest command and control systems in the world--the
SAGE system.

My Bachelor's Thesis invented a major new computer science technology.
That technology was used by me as the first computer consultant to the
United Nations, to develop their first programs for the large scale
processing of Statistical Data.

My Ph.D. thesis was in part in the computer science field, and was sponsored
by UNESCO.

I designed a breakthrough system that combined engineering and economics
computer analysis, and was a major reason my employer won three one-billion
dollar contracts in a competitive environment with the best in the industry.

I was one of the earliest members of the ACM, and had the Journal from
Volume 1 Number 1.

Don't let the fact that I've been an economist for the past 32 years confuse
you. I've had several parallel careers.

Anyone else wanna step up and prove that my comments about bright but
ill-educated people shooting from the hip here were on the mark.  :-)

David

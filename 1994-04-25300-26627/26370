This isn't crypto but I can't let this one slip by.  If the paper publishes
rumor, it is irresponsible; and if it does not publish rumor it is
responsible.  You have just described a tautology.  Papers are a lot more
complicated than that.

All papers publish rumors.  It just depends on whose.  They have ever since
the Fugger letters of the Middle Ages.  Yes, some papers check their
stories.  This consists of asking a few people a few questions.  Mostly
authority figures, like the police spokesman or the prosecutor.  Nothing
really searching.  They are publishing news, not research reports. 

Someday remind me to tell you about press releases.

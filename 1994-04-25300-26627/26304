	Did I read this right? Booby-trapped chips? Wouldn't it be
simpler to make an algorithm with one key and two shadow-keys, with the
key in the hands of users and each shadow-key in the hands of the govt?
That's how I understood Clipper was operating. If the govt *did* have
an easier backdoor than to use both shadow keys, someone ought to
post (on sci.crypt) how they would do that based on what they know
of Clipper.

is nothing to lock a prisoner down or harass him for, staff, correction 
officers and most any figure of authority in any institution will pull out
this ambiguous term."	-"Monster" Kody Scott, from _Monster: The

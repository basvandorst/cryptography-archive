No, it means that if you use a 430 or so bit key, it will take someone
a conceivable amount of time to crack it. ( a year or so with 600
workstations working part time- say a few hours to days on the best
thing available) a 1024 bit key however would take a fair amount of time
longer.

WEll I guess you get what you pay for.

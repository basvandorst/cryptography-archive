A more secure approach is to hash a 40 bit key appended to an
80 bit constant (which is well hidden in the product), and keep
only 56 bits of the result for the DES key.  Mail the constant(s)
used for the exportable products to the NSA in a secure manner.
If the 80 bit constant gets compromised, this plan is still no
worse than yours, but if not, it at least puts the KGB, Mafia,
GRU, and other potential adversaries of your customers at a
disadvantage.

If you want even more security without having to license an 
algorithm, you could use triple-DES or DIAMOND with SHA and 
longer constant in the manner shown above.

The obvious weak links are (1) the constant entrusted to the
NSA escrow-style in exchange for the priviledge of export, 
and (2) hiding a constant well in software takes a bit of
creativity.  Of course, hiding a constant in hardware is a
bit easier if you want to spend the money on it.

By the way, DIAMOND is a revision of MPJ2 that I'm currently
testing -- more info to follow.  Descriptions of MPJ2 can be
found on my BBS or ftp site.

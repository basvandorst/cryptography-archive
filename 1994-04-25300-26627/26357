People very regularly argue about what are "rights", and it's all very
pointless.  I have no idea where your "there are only two sources..."
comes from, but if you want to be totally anal about it, Webster's gives
as a definition of a "right":

    "a thing that one may legally or morally claim;  the state of being
     entitled to a privilege or immunity or authority to act ("a right of
     reply"; "human rights")."

So basically, if I think I have a moral right to something, I do, right?
What if someone makes a clear, convincing argument that they have a "moral
claim" to secure, private, non-escrowed encryption?  Would you concede that
they then have the right to such a system?  You seem to argue that there
are objective criteria to say what "rights" exist --- I'm saying it just
ain't so.

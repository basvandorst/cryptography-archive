Why can't you simply re-encrypt a potential plaintext and compare it to 
the original encryption?  i.e., with every potential key you try, you 
decrypt the ciphertext, and then re-encrypt the plaintext with the 
current potential key, creating a second encrypted file.  If the original 
encrypted file matches this pass's second encrypted file, you know you've 
got the right key, yes?  Of course, having the deciphered plaintext would 
be the real proof, but it's easier for a machine to see if two files are 
identical than to recognize plaintext.

I'm sure that the above is full of typical novice errors and things I 
haven't taken into account, so I'm certain kind cryptogensia will point 
out the error of my ways...

(Potential problems: (a) it takes more time, but then, this thread 
assumes special hardware so lack of coputer equipment shouldn't be a 
consideration, and (b) PGP does not encrypt files the same way twice...I 
don't know about DES)

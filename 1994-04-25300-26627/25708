You are correct there; I was assuming some form of access control between
processes and files. This is typically not present in a single user system;
even in one where the kernel is in a protected domain.

In any case, the claimed system is certainly not the first virus-proof system

However, assuming adequate access control mechansisms and a protected kernel,
all the virus could do is muck with one user's file. I really put that in the
category of a trojan house (but all this epidemiology is fuzzy as to what is
what).

Who's talking about integrity checkers. Take the approach of AT&T's B1 unix:
create a level below system low and put all protected programs there. Put
normal users at system low. With MAC rules, the files CANNOT be modified
(write down).

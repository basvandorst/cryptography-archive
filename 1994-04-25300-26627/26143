To the various people who pointed out that the
initial state is not needed to decrypt a CBC-mode
message:

You are correct; my statements to the contrary resulted
from my misunderstanding of exactly what CBC mode was.

While I can envision encryption modes in which decryption
would require both the initial state, and the key, CBC
is not such a mode.

Agreed.  The original argument was that the government should only be
able to violate some right of a citizen if there are actual cases of
where the government's inability to do so resulted in the government
losing cases (or some other bad consequence) as a result.  And, as
loathsome as it may be, I have to agree with David that this argument
(as it stands on its own) isn't a great one.  The writing of legislation
should not be limited to cases where the absence of legislation had
negative consequences.  Our legislature should be proactive as well.

Now, if this was all that David's argument was saying, then I'd agree
with him.  The problem is that the inference is that, like giving
nuclear weapons to Saddam, allowing citizens the right to privacy will
result in some aweful consequence that our government will be unable
to protect us from.  The problem is that unlike giving nuclear weapons
to Saddam, there is no clear evidence that allowing the government to
violate our right to privacy will protect us from anything.  (I think
that was the point that the original poster was trying to make.)  And
even if there are cases where the government could protect us from
some criminal, we still have to ask whether it warrants the forfeiting
of our right to privacy.

Frankly, I think that parallels between our right to privacy and our
"Miranda" rights are enlightening.  (I apologize, since I don't know
the detail of the "Miranda" rights and am just winging it here.)  The
Police are required to inform us of our rights when they arrest us.
They are required to tell us what charges are.  We're allowed to have
a lawyer present during interregation.  Sure, the cops could
presumably get more successful convictions of more bad guys if they
didn't have to grant those rights to individuals, but they do and
these rights are something that the courts respect.  Regardless of
guilt, if the police violate those rights, the court will (if TV is
any measure) let the criminal go.  (David, I hate to ask, but given
these abuses of the "Miranda" rights, do you think that those should
be suspended as well?)

I see our right to privacy on the same level.  Something that the
government simply needs to respect.  And unlike the handing out of
nuclear weapons to any and every unstable little government, there
is no clear evidence that granting citizens the right to privacy
(i.e. no Clipper escrow agencies) is going to be offset by any major
inability of the government to defend our interests.  Only in this
light ("hey, it's not clear that giving up my right to privacy is
going to keep the government from being able to capture bad guys")
does the wait-and-see attitude of the original posting make sense.

Or, if you're a corporation trying to protect business 
secrets. Or a lawyer in the midst of a high-stakes lawsuit.
Or a Citizens Group that's being spied on by the FBI
Or ...

Basically, the way I read your post is this : your data isn't
worth much and so Clipper suits your purposes just fine.

No problem. The big brouhaha over Clipper is *not* that
it doesn't provide an adequate level of safety for unimportant
data (although, we don't know whether it does or not). 

I'd suggest you go reread the last thousand or so posts on
this subject. Then you'll have an idea of what the debate 
*is* about.

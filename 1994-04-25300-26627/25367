Try finding a book titled "Cryptanalysis for Microcomputers".  It's all
in BASIC, which can be sped up a lot, but it gives good text descriptions
of cryptanalytic techniques for many simple ciphers.  Mono- and
polyalphabetic substitutions come first.

It has an appendix of pattern words, and in combination with a type
of crossword dictionary (that maps the number of letters and 3-letter
patterns to full words) it's pretty easy to break simple substitutions.

Don't forget to include options for C code as well.  Punctuation
goes up a lot in frequency.  (){}=+-*;, suddenly start appearing
a lot.

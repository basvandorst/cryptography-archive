Mostly, but heavily biased in favor of your paying to use RSA, their code 
for DES, RC-2, and RC-4.

If you want to sell devices to sell to the government for classified use, 
be prepared to accomodate a tamper-resistant chip that contains an 
algorithm nobody will tell you.  If you are interested in unclassified 
use, there is Capstone.  If you want to sell to the private sector, get 
something respected by the private sector (not Capstone or single DES). 


>4) Are RC2 and RC4 any good?

When used with a key of at least 80 bits, I have reason to believe that 
they are good in terms of security, but too expensive in terms of 
royalties you must pay to RSADSI.  There are cheaper alternatives.

NSA or RSA?  I suspect that earlier is better in both cases (RSADSI) for 
rights to the RSA algorithm, and the NSA for information about selling 
crypto devices to the government or about the technical issues 
surrounding export licensing.  The Department of State, Office of Defense 
Trade Controls, is also a good place to ask for information.

Peace to you.

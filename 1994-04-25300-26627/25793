That's a different argument. I guess you are using "open loop" control
system differently than the rest of the profession.

This is important because since you misdefined the system as "open loop",
the consequences of open loop system drift don't apply here and thus your
original argument fails.

You are now attempting to make a different argument. I think it speaks for
itself without the need for comment by me.

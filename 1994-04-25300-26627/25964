You may refer to the paper by Kaliski and Dusse:

@inproceedings{DK90:A,
        author = "S. R. Duss{\'{e}} and B. S. Kaliski Jr.",
        title = "A cryptographic library for the {Motorola DSP56000}",
        pages = "230--244",
        booktitle = "Advances in Cryptology --- EUROCRYPT 90",
        series = "{Lecture Notes in Computer Science, No. 473}",
        editor = "I. B. Damg\.{a}rd",
        publisher = sv,
        year = 1990}

Their implementation on a DSP56k (20 Mhz) for 512 bit decryption
(modulus 512 bits, exponent 512 bist) with CRT takes 44 ms. This
is approximately 3-4 times more than an exponentiation with
modulus 512 bits and exponent 256 bits. Thus, what they achieve
in approximately 10-15 ms, you achieve in 3000 ms.

So what is the trick? The trick is the ALGORITHMS.

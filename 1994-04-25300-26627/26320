I was reading about the RSA cryptosystem, and it was mentioned that knowing
phi(n) (that is, the totient of n), one could factor n.  A proof was given
in the specific case where n=pq (both p and q are prime), but it declined to
state how one would go about it in the general case.  It was also mentioned
that knowing a multiple of phi(n) in the case where n=pq would be enough to
factor n.  I know a probabalistic method for doing this, but not a
deterministic one.  Could someone point me to a reference which would
go into this with more detail?

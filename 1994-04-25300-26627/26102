   The general attack is the one I described in my previous post, against
the F-function.  A 3-round BLOWFISH using no subkeys allows this sort of
chosen-input attack against the F-function, if you use a kind-of neat
trick to get chosen inputs into the second round F-function.  (ANY 3-round
Feistel-type cipher allows this kind of attack....)
 
   L      R
   º->F->XOR  (3-round Feistel-type cipher, like BLOWFISH, DES, or FEAL.)
  XOR<-F<-º
   º->F->XOR
   L      R
 
   The trick is, choose 2**32 inputs to the cipher, by the following rule:
 
   L = 0, R = i     for i = 0 to 2**32-1
 
   One of these chosen inputs will lead to a chosen output whose output L
equals its input R.  This happens only when R = F(0).  We now know F(0).
 
   From here, we apply the chosen-input attack against the F() function.
Since we know F(0), we choose out inputs to the cipher to be
   0, R xor chosen_input    for each chosen input.
 
   I suspect this kind of trick has been used before, but I've never read
of it.  Any pointers would be appreaciated, as well as any comments.
Did I mess up any of my algebra or assumptions on either this attack or
the attack on the BLOWFISH F-function?

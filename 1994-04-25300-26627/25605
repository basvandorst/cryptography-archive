Beautiful!  That defeats this rng.  Thanks, John Kelsey.

Peter, I don't think bigger rotors help significantly, it's still the same
problem.  It is vulnerable to piecemeal attack.  We don't need to isolate
all low order bits, we could isolate a few bits in a few bytes, guess what
they might be, then check our guess against a live sequence of output.

As I said, I'm interested in the thinking.  We are making the cryptographer's
mistake, assuming the cryptanalyst must play the game the way we have 
structured that guarantees he must lose.  But he plays the game his way, not
as we want him too.

It's like we made a huge cheese ball and claimed "You can't eat this because
we can prove it is too big to swallow."  It's true but the cryptanalyst eats
it in nibbles.  We gotta stop making crypto systems outa cheese!

Still, a byte rng is too attractive to me to give up this cheese too quickly.
I have one more fillip, which I will add later.

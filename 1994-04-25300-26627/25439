Fair enough, and let me not go too far in trying to defend this
bizarre notion (cf. Moravec's "Mind Children" for a longer
discussion).

The "flourish" of blowing up the universe, or the world, or one's
self, is usually thrown in to make a point about dividing the branches
into "winners" and "losers." Indeed, nothing that happens in one
universe affects what happens in other, parallel universes.

But, in my fictitious (I hope) example, the Russians had actually
rigged it so that losing guesses would wipe out the world. If they
were telling the truth (cf. the similar analysis of Newcomb's
Paradox), then in fact in this world they have gotten the right answer
each and every times, since we're still here.

Strangely, this is an important point in "proving" that the method
works (psychologically, at least). A scenario in which nothing
happened when wrong guesses were made would be what we have now.

Again, I don't subscribe to this whole view.

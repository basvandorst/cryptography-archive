You're mistaken.  I acknowledged this point specifically, and you quoted me:

I also ignored his first point.  I'd dearly love to see the reaction from
the President and Congress if they were asked to use Clipper in their
unclassified phone calls.

Hal asked us to focus on the second point, which I did.  We've discussed
in this forum at enormous length the questions of whether the government
will continue to allow unescrowed encryption.  David Lytel presented at
CFP 94 the White House's view that key escrow for all encryption is
important, though not (yet) mandated.

Pervasive Clipperage is not yet inevitable.  So far about 17,000 Clipper
chips have been programmed, I believe.  Until it <is> pervasive, the
needle-in-haystack argument flies just fine, thank you.

Easily?  Read Kessler's "The FBI" (1993).  Besides, if you have powerful
enemies you need to be especially careful.

Using Clipper to prevent your neighbor on a party line from eavesdropping
on you is overkill; even the government doesn't try to sell silly
justifications like this.

The most recent edition of Information Week has a blurb about these people
(this term applied loosely) and their doings.  They say that they are on the
cutting edge of advertising on the Internet.  It also says that their service
provider cut them off because of all the flame mail they got.  If this is what
advertising on the net will mean, by all means, let them have their fun and
show others that have an idea of attempting this what will happen when millions
of people take exception to their practices.

I quess one can look at it in many ways, but aren't we basically
just a bunch of people dealing with each other. And isn't the question
about how much we should be sticking our noses into each other's affairs.

Personally I think that if this country made a public policy of allowing
strong non supervised (escrowed or otherwise) encryption for domestic
use as well as for export and if this country were to make a policy
against government supervision of said technologies then we would be
setting an example for other countries to follow. I think this example
would give power to the hands of people in other countries and make
it harder for a dictator to get away with misinformation campaigns.
I think this would further America's goals in the world. And to play
with words we could call it "the moral high ground". I think it would 
sell and I think we would be better off for it.

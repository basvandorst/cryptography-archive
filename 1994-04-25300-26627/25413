"Lying?," Grady? That seems rather harsh, libelous even. This is a
put up or shut up situation. Can you justify such a charge? If so
please do. If not, apologies are definitely in order.

The character you seem bent upon assasinating seems to be yours, in
my opinion. I don't know either you or David S., except from your
posts here, but my esteem for David is holding up quite well.

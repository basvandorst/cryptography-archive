A key to political power is making one's opponents appear rude, and one
popular way to do it is to concoct some stunning stupidity that can't be
disputed without boring those who don't trust you and offending those who do.
 
Would you really have trusted your Fortune 50 corporation's communications
to crypto gear that can be broken wide open by one corrupt DA, one corrupt
judge, and one corrupt cop?
 
Ask the IRS for their definition of 'voluntary'.  They use it a lot.

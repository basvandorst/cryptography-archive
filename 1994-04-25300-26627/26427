Either you or they got it wrong - RSA-129 has been broken, not RSA.
RSA-129 is one 129-digit N=P*Q combination, which has now been factored.
(Yee-hah!  Good work, folks!)  Total work was about 8000 MIPS-years,
if I remember the number right.  So that suggests that if you use a
384-bit RSA key, the NSA or a bunch of volunteers could break it in a
few months.  If you use 512-bit, you're probably safe for now.
1024-bit is fine.

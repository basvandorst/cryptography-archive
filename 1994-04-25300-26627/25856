Suppose I have a one time pad encryption system. My pad is 4GB. I'd like to  
know if there are reasonable schems for reusing the pad. 

A straight reuse leads to a period of 32Gbit. But if once in a while I do a new  
synch between both sides at some random new position, I have the feeling that  
breaking such a pad could be very difficult.

I was wondering if people can shed some light on this issue. How do I calculate  
the strength/weakness of such a system?

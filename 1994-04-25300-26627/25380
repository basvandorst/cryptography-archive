You'll find that many people ignore "please respond by email"
remarks in Usenet postings.

Some of them figure that if you want people to read the network
to see your request-for-help, you should be willing to read
the network yourself.  Others believe that there's no such
thing as a topic that only one person is interested in, so
they reply to the net as a whole ... presuming the response will
be welcomed by more people than the single solitary original
requestor.  Still others are skeptical of email addresses,
having several times been hosed themselves by email to far
away places.

Having said that, let me direct your attention to a paper
in Crypto by Fairfield, Mortensen, and Coulthart of AT&T
Bell Labs entitled "An LSI Random Number Generator".  The
first paragraph of its abstract is

    "This paper describes a CMOS digital LSI device which generates
     a random bit stream based on the frequency instability of a
     free running oscillator.  The output of the device is a truly
     random ninary number; not pseudo random."

The paper appears on pages 203-230.  You can look in your
AT&T databook (or call your AT&T semiconductor sales
representative) to see whether they still sell it.

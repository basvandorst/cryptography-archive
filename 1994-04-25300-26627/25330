"Touche" on all three criticisms:  the exact word stamped on Erwin Knoll's
published article was not "Classified" but something else meaning "secret,"
and I misspelled "Sartre" and am embarrassed, and I erroneously stated that
Sartre was a Communist and appreciate the correction.

My point---and this time I'll state it as humorlessly and boringly as
possible---was that we should not assume competence on the part of the
domestic spy agencies.  Much of what they get, they get wrong.

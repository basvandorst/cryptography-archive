You should realize, of course, that your risk is much greater...
anyone in the next building can listen into your wireless lan without
any intrusion...IE. all those office buildings on the other side
of the freeway from Motorola HQ represent potential Japanese listening
posts.  So it will take reasonablely strong crypto to be "equivalent".

(I think this disqualifys DES :)

Capstone (HW only) is out.  The HW requirement means you are probably
confined to DES and TDES as I know of no other crypto in a chip.  Hopefully
someone will post a follow-up showing me to be wrong. PLEASE!

HA!  I knew there would be a problem!  You are stuck with CAPSTONE,
which no foreigner in his right mind would buy, and DES and TDES.

DES and TDES :)

TDES is a more advanced version of DES (Triple DES).  I would do it,
based on your constraints.

Anybody agree?

   Yes, but you have admitted that the available evidence indicates that IDEA

   have to ask is just how weak (or strong) RSA is.

   Paul Leyland estimates a 1024-bit RSA key would take 300 GIPS years (three
   thousand 100 MIPS processors doing nothing else for a year).  Someone else


*If* I said that, I was wrong.  That is about the computation, within
a factor of a few, needed to break a 600-bit key.

1024-bit keys are safe for the next few decades, assuming that the
experience of the last few decades is a good model for what will
occur.

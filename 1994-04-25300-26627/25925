This is a good argument and the only weakpoint I can see in it is that
people will probably think that the Clipperized transmissions are more
secure than they are. They are still vulnerable to governmental abuse
and sophisticated bribery. This is more secure than plaintext, but not
as secure as it could be.

A more sophisticated argument would note that making Clipper standard
would give our "enemies" one single target to hit. It would be a big
target too and every foreign country interested in industrial espionage
would be gaming for hit. No Clipper Standard could mean many different
standards and no single big target. We could , for instance, include
a crypto "standard" that could expand to include more algorithms. 

The problem with the argument is that it doesn't deal with the most
practical problem: cost. Chips and associated hardware costs money.
Software costs money too, but it is usually alot less. Plus, a clipper
chip would suck power and battery life from a cellular phone,
Newton/PDI/EO or whatever else.

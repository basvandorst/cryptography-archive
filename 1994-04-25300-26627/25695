There is no such thing as "secure forever", except for rather unpractical
one-time pad, of course.

On the other hand, you can make it "practically forever", chosing the
key length, and such to ensure it will stand for NN years (barring
unpredictable :-). I'd say - you can be safe for a decade or two
with 1024-bit RSA key, and if you REALLY want more - hey, it's
your CPU time, generate 3000-bit keys!

Are you really concerned about grand-grandson of NSA director
cracking your e-mail captured in 1994? (:-)

Um, you certainly know better. (:-)

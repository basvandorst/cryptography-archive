True enough, but it misses my point (and I may be wrong in any case
although I predicted to a colleague soon after RSA was introduced
that it would be broken by factoring much more readily than was
advertised). Of course, you can readily increase key data of any
coding scheme. But my point was that for any fixed-length key data,
simple number theoretic coding schemes are inherently relatively
more vulnerable to mathematical discovery and analysis of new
parallel algorithms for breaking them. I could be wrong. It is my hunch.

He can do anything he likes if it's his BBS, within the limits of the law.

But in the case of PGP, the MIT/Stanford patent's holders say it's an
infringement of their U.S. patent. So far the patent hasn't been overturned
in court, nor do I think it likely to be since every time the patent holders
wrote a cease and desist letter, the offenders ceased and desisted.

Thus the sysop is behaving properly in keeping patented and copyright
material off his BBS unless he has the permission of the patent or copyright
holder.

What EVER gave you the idea PGP was "legal", in the sense of being
non-infringing?

Would thermal neutron imaging help?  At IPNS (Intense Pulsed Neutron
Source) thermal neutrons are used to image crystal structures of many
angstroms.  this is non-ionizing radiation which can penetrate meters
of material.  by setting up the pulses to pass thru cold crystal
structures, coherent waves of neutrons can be generated and various
layers of a chip can be focused and analyzed by moving either the
chip or the detector.  Obviously the electrical nature of the
structure (i.e. voltage values) can't be seen this way, but it
should be possible to at least duplicate the structure with a non
invasive method and then play with the voltages in the duplicate.

This requires some vast resources, but there are many countries with
reactors and creating thermal coherent neutron waves isn't that hard.
It would also be very difficult to protect against.

Patience, persistence, truth,

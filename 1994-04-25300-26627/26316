Subject: DNA Public Key Encryption.
Lines: 20

Has anyone heard of the system that employs all or part of the
electrochemically extracted DNA code of a human to serve as the
basis of a half of a key pair in a public key encryption scheme?

Apparently the DNA key is the secret key of the keypair, the size
of the public key generated is selectable; all of the DNA code can
be used of just 2 bytes, sepending on the speed/performance
required.

Also, there is a feature that, once a key size smaller than the
whole DNA sequence is chosen, a sliding window function randomly
chooses the starting point on the DNA from which the public key is
to be generated. Since DNA is so huge, it would be hard for an
attacker to go through every starting point to re-generate the
secret key 

It sounds quite interesting, but what if you have your key stolen
from your machine? you wont be able to get a fresh one will you?
And also, whenever you give a blood test, your key would be
compromised.

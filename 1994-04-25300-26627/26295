I can't speak for encryption, but for cryptanalyis of classic ciphers,
here are a few primitive functions:
1.  factoring.  into composites as well as primes.  Used for solving
		rectangular transpositions, determining periods of
		polyalphabetics, etc.  
2.  permutation generators.  columns, rows, diagonals, spirals, etc.,
		to fit in any orthogonal matrix.
3.  sorts.	Radix sort and quicksort seem best.  To avoid MxN
		searches.

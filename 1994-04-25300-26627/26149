At this year's RSA Data Security conference National Semiconductor
announced the iPower smartcard. Currently in PCMCIA format this card holds
(or will hold, I'm not sure if they are real yet) eeprom memory, random
number generator and encryption engines for DES, RSA, etc etc. Designed
specifically for this task it uses tamperproof chips to hold your keys.
Indeed, I believe it is supposed to be capable of generating RSA keys
internally, so the private key never leaves the chip.

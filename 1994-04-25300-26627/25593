Ahh, my PC monitor exploded and I've just got back on-line, so I'm not
sure whether this is an April Fool posting I've just collected.
(Apparently my '24-hour on site' service contract means a guy with a
toolbox coming the next day - but a replacement monitor takes a lot
longer :-(( )

Yes, MS-Windows may swap DOS tasks to a swap-file, (temporary per Windows
session, or permanent depending on configuration).

The good news is that a native Windows app can lock pages in memory,
preventing them from being swapped.  The bad news is that like MS-DOS
Windows is a single user system, and data memory can be read by other
programs.


I hope this helps,

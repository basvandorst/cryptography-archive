I do not wear these blinders, David.  I have said explicitly
and repeatedly that there are REAL costs to absolute privacy
of communication.

There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that crimes could be
prevented, and lives saved, if each of us were required to
wear a microphone around our necks to monitor *all* of our speech,
solely for the purposes of national security and legitimate law
enforcement.

Remarkably, our technology is driving us to a sharp distinction
between absolute privacy of communication content and general
monitoring of electronic communication.  It *is* black and white;
there is no middle ground here.

The marginal costs of secure privacy in communication are
rapidly approaching zero. If genuinely private speech is to be
prohibited, there *will* be a War on Privacy; the economics
and morality of such a war would be hopeless to the aggressors.

|                              Version 2.0
|                             March 16, 1994
| 
| RSA LABORATORIES, A DIVISION OF RSA DATA SECURITY, INC. ("RSA")
| GRANTS YOU A LICENSE AS FOLLOWS TO THE "RSAREF" PROGRAM:

| 1.   LICENSE. RSA grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable,
|      perpetual (subject to the conditions of Section 8) license for
|      the "RSAREF" program (the "Program") and its associated
|      documentation, subject to all of the following terms and
|      conditions:

[Sections 1.a through 1.d omitted]

| "Application Programs" are programs which incorporate all or any
| portion of the Program in any form. The restrictions imposed on
| Application Programs in this Agreement shall not apply to any
| software which, through the mere aggregation on distribution media,
| is co-located or stored with the Program.

| 2.   LIMITATIONS ON LICENSE.

[Section 2.a omitted]


|      b.   The Program may not be used directly for revenue-generating
|           purposes. You may not:

[Sections 2.b.(i) and 2.b.(ii) omitted]

|           (iii) license or otherwise distribute any Application
|                Program without the express written acknowledgment of
|                the end user that the Program will not be used in
|                connection with any revenue-generating activity of the
|                end user.

[Remainder of license omitted]

That seems rpetty definite to me.  I can't put an Application Program
(defined roughly as anything that incorporates RSAREF, the "Program")
anywhere that just anyone can pick it up.  I have to collect paper
(the usual legal definition of "written").  Thie means it can't go on
BBS's, FTP sites, or I can't just give it to a friend without
administrative impedimentia.  I call that a pain in the ass.
The current status quo on the ITAR requires less overhead.

   OK. I have to agree with David on this statement. Shall we take this 
as an axiom? Shall we agree on a definition of rights? But anyway...

   OK. I'm not certain how you are applying natural to catholicism and
what exactly your point is here. Would you mind being more explicit?
I'm not up on modern catholic social theory. :)

   Hmmmm, I think that "perceived Constitutional authority" might more
accurately reflect the situation.

   OK, now here's where things get sticky.

   Congress did not promote the Clipper Chip, the Executive Branch did.
Big difference. The "social contract" you speak of, the Constitution,
gives Congress the power to wage legislation in the land, and the 
Executive branch the power to enforce said legislation. Further, this
rahter significant infringement on individual privacy was promulgated by
an agency whose powers, influence, motives, and methods we can only guess
about. This makes me nervous, especially considering a past history of
violating the trust of the collective American people.

   Further, I must take exception to your choiice of wording:
"lobbying Congress." *I* should not have to lobby Congress to prevent
fundamental and overiding priviledges provided by the social contract
arbitrarily infringed and negated. Notice that I call them
priviledges, that is what they are: nice luxuries provided by the
social contract intended to protect us from the predations of an
over-zealous government. Natural law provides us with no recourse but
superior arms and strength, avoiding which, I believe is the intent of
such social contracts. However, neither does the government in any way
shape or form have the power to remove or infringe on those rights
except in very limited and delineated circumstances, the most common
of these being the "provide for the common defense" clause.

   (trying to herd my stampede of thoughts back to David's comments)

   My point (one of them at least), is that it should not be necessary
to "lobby" Congress to repeal authority that was never granted, and in
mant instances, specifically excluded from, the Executive Branch. It is
a sad condition this nation has acheived if the rights of the 
government take precedence over the rights of the people ( NOT the
governed: of the people, by the people, for the people...).

   Of course, I also question the "right" of the government to keep 
*anytyhing* at all secret from the people. But that's a whole different
can of worms...

It is a no-no in classic ciphers.  But DES is not a classic cipher.  It is
not a problem so long as brute force key exhaustion is the only method to
crack the cipher.

Should a short cut attack be found, then the matching ciphertext-plaintext
makes cryptanalysis easier.  Of course, it wouldn't matter because the
DES would be worthless for computer cryptography, with or without a crib.

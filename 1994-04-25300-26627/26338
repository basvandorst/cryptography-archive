I am currently looking at security aspects of the human Genome Project.
This project involves heterogeneous databases scattered all over the
world. Current policies allow almost anyone to insert and/or read data.

I am trying to remember or track down a vague story I heard a couple
of years ago. It seems some hackers broke into a medical database in
a hospital and altered some patient records regarding prescriptions.
As a result some patients got the wrong dossage or wrong drug and nearly
died. I believe it happened in New York.

Does anyone know of or remember this incident? If so, can you provide
more information or a reference?

The Genome project, in its current state, is highly vulnerable to
such hacking.

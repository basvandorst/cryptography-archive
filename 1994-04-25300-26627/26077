I don't get it.  Obviously, even if Ames didn't sell Clipper info
to Russians, it is only a matter of time before the secret leaks
out.  Money pressure from foreign intelligence and organized crime
is so large that anyone who thinks no NSA employee can be bought
has to have his head examined.

Why doesn't _this_ scenario, a virtual certainty, make anybody nervous?

Last but not least, the usual objection: what's the point of
designing and implementing a system which will never be used by
any criminal?  Even if all non-Clipper crypto is outlawed,
criminals will still use non-Clipper crypto. So what's the point?

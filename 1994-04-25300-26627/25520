Another sophistication that could be added to the process of embedding a 
message in a picture would be to use only a small percentage of the pixels to
"corrupt" with your message.  You could have a program which randomly selected
which pixels (say averaging 1 in 100, but not spaced every 100) based on
the part of a password that you choose.  The rest of the password would be
used in the normal encryption like PGP.

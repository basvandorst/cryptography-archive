      There no such thing as hardware implementation of "reasonable"
   crypto anymore.  Hardware only crypto has too many practical problems

Sure there is - as long as you're depending on the strengths of the
algorithm and not on the obscurity of the hardware.  
Software implementations are more flexible, and when burned into hardware
(e.g. Triple-DES or IDEA running on a DSP ior 80186 with code in PROM)
can be upgraded by upgrading the firmware; depending on your cost
models you may want to combine them on one chip, use plug-in PROMs,
or include the crypto code in the flash eprom that's supporting the
whole product.  For higher-performance applications, there are chips
from folks like VLSI (yes, the Clipper silicon makers) that will run
rings around Clipper.  

On the other hand, Clipper is being subsidized, not only in the design
and so-called escrow, but probably in the code-and-key-burning phase;
NSA's estimate of $10 for their charade-in-a-vault sounds unrealistic,
and Mykotronx's description of the unprogrammed chip costs said they
were more than the NSA said the programmed chip would cost.

So, sure, if you want to design some DES and IDEA polycells and
publish them, you can probably find FTP sites to put them on;
I think I've seen DES polycell designs from several silicon vendors.

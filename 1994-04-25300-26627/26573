Oh well, I was going to ignore the reply to my message that you mention
above, since responding wouldn't have served any useful purpose...  However, 
since you think "I got it" or whatever, I will say just a few things.

Yes, you have *some* experience with computers, and it looks like you
might have done some interesting stuff in the 50's.  A lot has happened
since the 50's though, David.  None of that has any bearing on the fact
that you say flat-out technically incorrect things (in fact, the brute
force key cracking thing was the only time I recall you ever actually
*admitting* that you were wrong).  Yes, you have experience, as your
posting showed.  You seem to have *very* limited current knowledge, though.
That point stands, and is indisputable.

   Nothing in natural law entitles one to crytography, escrow-free or not.
   Nothing in natural law entitles you to telephones, computers etc.
   There is no "right to privacy" in natural law.

Does natural law entitle me to speak or write as I wish (assuming I have
the paper)?  If so, why does natural law differentiate between speech
that someone else can understand and speech that someone else can't
understand?  Cryptography is merely a way of expressing myself such that
my desired audience can understand me and that anyone else (hopefully)
can't.

   Thus the sources for such things lie in the social contract. So far the
   government has, under its Constitutional authority, created the ITAR with
   respect to exports, done Clipper, etc. etc.

And the social contract in question says, very clearly, that the
government may not abridge freedom of speech.  Exactly how is
cryptography different from any other speech?

Notice that I am not claiming that one is entitled by any form of
"natural law" to FREE cryptography.

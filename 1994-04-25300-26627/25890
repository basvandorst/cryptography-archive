It is a safe assumption that all the netnews is archived somewhere.
There is about 20 MB/day of it, or 7000 MB/year.  A year of netnews
would fit on one Exabyte 8mm backup tape with data compression.
I'm sure the NSA can afford this.

In fact, a similar calculation shows that the NSA can probably afford
to keep recordings of every *voice phone call* placed in the US, 24
hours day, local and long distance.  It might take 10,000 tapes a day
depending on your assumptions, but that is less than $20 million a
year in tapes (assume they use 8mm video tape bought at retail, you
don't need data grade tape for this kind of thing as you can stand a
few dropouts).  $20 million/year is peanuts for the NSA.  *Getting*
the data is a much bigger task than storing it.

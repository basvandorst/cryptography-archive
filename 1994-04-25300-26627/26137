Does anyone have C software or know where to find software, that
produces public key, cryptographically secure signatures? Its for an
embedded application, to check that the software hasn't been illegally
patched.

If the code has been changed then it should not detect this, the
certificate should not be forgeable, nor should there be a secret key
that the recipient needs to know that could be used to produce
certificates.

This is for a product that will sell in Canada, and Europe, but the
product doesn't involve encryption in itself. It is possible that we
might want to sell the product in America.

I was thinking about using MD4/5 together with a public key encryption
system, which probably can't be RSA if we want to sell to America.

Anyway, any ideas?

Right.  All we had to do was convince the Japanese (before Pearl Harbor)
that they were only supposed to use crypto for which the keys were managed
by U.S.  escrow agencies.  "But we promise not to peek ... really."

And sure, terrorists are definitely going to use crypto that the gov't has
the keys to decrypt.  Only stupid terrorists that is.

Unless the gov't makes it illegal to use non-clipper encryption, it is
obvious that criminals, terrorists, and generally naughty people will
gravitate to non-clipper codes.  It's simple.  If you want to say something
that you don't want the gov't to hear, don't use a code for which the gov't
has the key.

I suspect that this is why people are so suspicious of gov't claims that
non-clipper codes won't be made illegal.  Until the gov't does so, it means
that wrong-doers have a legitimate way to crypt info that the gov't can't
easily get to.  And this seems to defeat the purpose of clipper to start
out with.

This is difficult to bring up in a way that will NOT provoke much noise
& flames, but here's an attempt. Note the followup.

A PBS interview show "Charlie Rose" recently had an interview with an
author of a book on US official inaction in regards the Holocaust
before & during WWII. During the show, one guest made mention of Ultra
decrypts on the subject.

In all my reading on Ultra, Enigma, and Bletchley {when WILL I learn to
spell that ;-?} Park; not once did I see any mention of decrypts on
that topic. Yet it seems logical to me that there must of been, given
the Nazi bent for daily accurate reporting and BP's work.

Has anyone seen any discussion of this written up?

As anybody can see, this WAS NOT posted from my account. I have no
accounts anywhere in the world, except on
fbihh.informatik.uni-hamburg.de, so any message that you see from "me"
coming from elsewhere is an obvious fake. (Now, don't I just love PGP
that allows me to sign this statement...)

The funny thing is that the offender has set up a .forward file on the
above account, which forward all e-mail to me. Therefore, please, DO
NOT e-mail the above account with your flames, because it will be me
who will get them. Instead, e-mail to the syadmin of the site with
your complains. I alsready did so.

Let's take this lightly and pity the clueless newbie who will have his
account removed, until he grows up and learns to be polite on the net.

Regards,
Vesselin

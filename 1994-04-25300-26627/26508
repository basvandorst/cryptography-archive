It's probably taken from the French, where l'informatique means all to do 
with computers and software.  I don't see why it needs to be used in 
English, as there are several terms in existance already, both with finer 
definition (computerdom, info tech etc etc etc) and as general as 
l'informatique.  The term was invented in France inorder to protect 
their public from adopting English terms.  (This is not the first time :)

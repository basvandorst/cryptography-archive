hi everyone,
        I recently reead an article in "Wired" magazine about a new 
encryption shareware that's out there on the internet. It actually takes 
a text message, and somehow changes it into what appears to be a graphics 
file, pretty slick huh? anyways, money is tight, and I didn't buy the 
magazine. Does anybody know where I can get this encryption program? From 
what I understand you can even use it along with pgp:-)
please send me replies ASAP. thanks
James./

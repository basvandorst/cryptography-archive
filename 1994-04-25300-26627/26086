There appears to be to varieties of "reducto ad absurdum".  The first is
more than a rhetorical technique - it's a valid mathematical technique
for proving an assumption wrong.  (Though there is a subset of mathematicians,
constructionists, who explore what can be done without using this techique).

The second version of this technique is rhetorical and not mathematical.
It consists of reducing any thread to silliness by patently absurd analogies.

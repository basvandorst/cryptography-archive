The A5 algorithm is implemented in silicon, and can be done in about 3K 
transistors.  A5 is keyed by another algorithm, A8 (I wonder who thinks up 
these names) in the subscriber identity module (SIM), and produces as output 
114-bit blocks of data which are XOR'ed with the plaintext.  A5X is just a 
weakened version of A5.

Probably not difficult.  I don't think it's as well-guarded as, say, 
Skipjack, because equipment manufacturers in many countries need to know 
about it for interoperability purposes.

Quite probably.  From what I've seen and heard, A5 can be broken in a short 
time, and A5X can be broken in real time (one source commented that GCHQ's 
idea of "strong voice encryption" means "can't be broken in real time").

The only thing that really matters is to get the signal-to-noise
ratio down.

As things currently stand, there's just too much junk on PGP,
Clipper, politics, export laws, anti-Sternlight flames, etc.
for reading sci.crypt to be worthwhile.

While there is some good talent left in sci.crypt, virtually
all of the prominant figures in the commercial and academic crypto
worlds avoid posting on sci.crypt.  Many have also stopped lurking.
People like Hellman, Rivest, Diffie, Denning, Kalisi, Bidzos, etc.
rarely (if ever) post to sci.crypt, and several of the above have 
even told me they were driven away by the number of flames, 
inappropriate posts, and junk e-mail they had to deal with.  
Meanwhile they frequnetly run articles about crypto in RISKS -- a forum 
not even officially dedicated to cryptography!

A good, intelligently-moderated group just might be a way to get 
prominant cryptographers back onto the net.  Personally I'd
be delighted to take part in a forum where I knew the articles were
appropriate and well thought out.

If I've got it right, then normal archivers (ZIP,ARJ,..) encrypt
all data in a file - but why not just encrypt the huffman tree data
preceeding the huffman encoded data. Without the huffman-tree info,
the remaining data should be fairly random, and therefore hard to
brute-force decrypt. Using this idea would make encryption/decryption
much(!) faster with the same level of security offered.

Perhaps it's a good idea to always compress your data before encryption.
This way you get the real info separated from the redundacy - and just
apply your time-consuming algorithm on the actual information contained
in the data. This will allow you to use much more complex (read: time
consuming) cryptation algorithms because you need only compress much
less
actual data. I'm currently working on my own compression archiver (final
project on my university) and have considered adding some tough
cryptation.

All the best,Stig Valentini

   I saw an add in Compuserve Magazine regarding ViaCrypt PGP
and I have some questions:

   Has anyone tried it?
   If yes, how does the front end for CIS work?

   In the add it mentioned that ViaCrypt has an "Interoperable version"
of their software.  What does this mean?  

   Is the "ViaCrypt" version significantly different from the public 
domain PGP 2.3A?  If yes, how so?

   Is ViaCrypt PGP shipping today?
   What is ViaCrypt's upgrade policy?  
   Does ViaCrypt have any public key servers? 
   Does ViaCrypt have any plans for creating a trusted network (hierchy) for key
   distribution and other services similar to notery services on paper today.
   Does the price for ViaCrypt only cover one license?
   Does ViaCrypt support all of the features found in 2.3A like armored asci,
conventional, signatures, etc?

   The add says the price for $119.98+sh+tx+etc.

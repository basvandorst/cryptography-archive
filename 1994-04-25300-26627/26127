Sir Harry Hinsley has talked here on this subject. The Germans did indeed 
consider it - in fact the number of keys used by all their networks went up 
sharply towards the end of the war. 

Although they refused to believe that Enigma could be broken, they were 
acutely aware that captures and agents could compromise the security of keys, 
and as their forces started to suffer defeats they increased the frequency of 
keychange from monthly to weekly, daily and finally twelve hourly.

However in the case of the U-boats it was impractical to give each boat 
its own key, as the boats had to communicate with each other while hunting
in packs, and with `mother' ships to be resupplied at sea.

Our CM-5 has 32 MBytes per processor.

Again, serious code breakers probably will use VLSI and not general
purpose computers. And custom VLSI designs are much, much faster than
any commercial CPU for their function. (A VLSI chip was designed for
one of my algorithms and ran as fast as 8000 (slow) CM-2 processors;
I'm not saying this is representative, although the CM-2 was well suited
for the processing and the code was hand optimized.)

	[ stuff about his new Data Encryption Algorithm ]

Thanks for posting a reference to your forthcoming product and where
to get evaluation versions.  A couple of comments:
1) Data Encryption Algorithm is *far* too generic a name.
   If you can't give it a catchy, easy-to-remember title,
   please call it something boring and unique like "DEA-42"
   so it's easy not to confuse reviews of it with discussions of the
   US government's Data Encryption Algorithm from DES.

2) It's ok to post complete algorithm descriptions to the net,
   just (maybe) not source code.  A first glance at your synopsis
   looked like it wasn't enough detail to implement,
   though it was nice to see some discussion of your motivations for
   parts of the algorithm.

3) I'm quite puzzled by seeing the phrase "One-time pad" in something
   that's clearly not a one-time pad algorithm.  Does it really depend
   on shared key material that parts of it are never reused?

   -if an algorithm is crackable for text, is it worthless for video?

Depends on what you're trying to accomplish.  Generally, that's true,
but an algorithm designed to keep people from getting The Sports Channel
without subscribing doesn't need to be strong as an algorithm designed
to keep data secure for 50 years.  However, triple-DES or IDEA should
keep your data secure for somewhere between half a century and the age
of the universe, unless somebody discovers some hole in the theory
that isn't currently apparent.  But you don't have to worry about
brute force, assuming you do your implementation carefully.

   -minimizing encrypt time
There are chips that can do DES at 192 Mbps; that's fast enough for
totally uncompressed digital video...  more realistically, you
probably will want to do some sort of digital video compression which
takes more horsepower and latency than the encryption.

   -minimizing playback latency due to initializing the decryption

Initialization involves two parts - initializing any block chaining algorithm,
which typically takes the time to encrypt 8 bytes of data, e.g. nothing,
and handling any key exchange, which may take a second or ten up from
depending on how complex your key exchange strategy is, but doesn't
matter for real-time unless you've got a *very* specialized application.

   -maximum real-time playback data rate vs. complexity of key/algorithm
   -maximum real-time playback data rate vs. cost of the compute engine
   -minimizing the storage requirements of the receive hardware

Video compression hardware far dominates the costs.

   -network costs/benefits vs. using locked containers over FedEx.

Depends entirely on your traffic patterns.  A T1 line across the
country can cost $5-10000 per month, but can carry quite good video,
though you'd want more than that for, say, commercial movie masters.
On the other hand, if it's enough bandwidth, the latency's a lot
better than FedEx, which does generally take overnight.

   -thwarting all those who wish to copy the data for about the next 50 years,
   thus, what computing power will be available in 2044 for, say $1000 in 1994
   dollars? $1B in 1994 dollars?

   Of course, a person at a receiving site can simply point an analog camera
   and microphone at the screen and speaker.

Or grab the digital signals once they're decrypted, or grab the analog
signals on their way to the speakers and screen....

   Thus, another--possibly
   absurd--desire is to discover a way to make it difficult for persons to
   produce a viable digital master from the analog movie image, while
   preserving high-quality playback. 

The audio and video-tape industries have wrangled about this for a
while - unless you can contractually lock people in to using a given set of
hardware, it's pretty tough.  You *can* play games with embedding
information into the images, so you can see *whose* copy a bootleg was
ripped off from, but that also depends on what kind of data you have.

Why would it cost _more_ than the the cost of clipper? With the
best people in the field (the non-aligned) working on the project,
surely the costs could be kept to a level below the US gov.s
unlimited budget spend frenzies?
How much did it cost to develop and refine PGP? Programmes wirtten
to be blown into an EPROM that would then sit in a generic
encryption box that is in line with the phone and the wall socket
could be a cheaper way to go: the expense would be in the design of
the black box base with the fast A/D ect hardware whilst the critical
algorithm sits in an upgradeable EPROM in a zif on the top of the
box!   
Could this work?

In article <WCS.94Apr27050142@anchor.ATT.COM> I wrote:
   Either you or they got it wrong - RSA-129 has been broken, not RSA.
   RSA-129 is one 129-digit N=P*Q combination, which has now been factored.
   (Yee-hah!  Good work, folks!)  Total work was about 8000 MIPS-years,
   if I remember the number right.  So that suggests that if you use a
   384-bit RSA key, the NSA or a bunch of volunteers could break it in a
   few months.  If you use 512-bit, you're probably safe for now.
   1024-bit is fine.

It's been suggested that, since the NSA allows export of 512-bit RSA
for use with 40-bit-key RC2/RC4, they can probably crack that if they
have to.  And while 1024 bits are fine for now, they're probably not
enough for encrypting stuff like nuclear secrets you want kept safe
for centuries.  My disclaimer still stands, though :-)

I'm deeply sorry because I took your time with a subject, which already
has been exloited. You're right, I've no right to present the thoughts
as original. Also did i forget to addd (c) and (tm) when speaking of ZIP
and ARJ. I humbly apologize, to all wasting time reading my postings - I
will terminate all further talks about compression and encryption. I
have no excuse - only the fact remains, that there's a lot more
intelligent people than me out there. I'll just stick to compression -
encrytion wasn't my field anyway. If you can, please accept my humble
apologizes...
All the best,
Stig Valentini

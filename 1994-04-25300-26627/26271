   Excuse my ignorance here, but what damage could have been done to
   Clipper?  Is there some weakness in the algorithm that the Russians
   could exploit to listen in on U.S. citizens, or is it just that
   the Russians would be able to build Clipper compatible, non-escrowed
   systems? If the latter, what's to be gained by starting over?

The problem is that because of the design features of the Clipper's
protocol, once the algorithm is known, it is possible to read any
Clipper-encoded transmission.  I don't remember the details now, but I
remember reading a discussion of how Clipper works, and that point was
explained in detail.  That's why the Clipper chips have to be made
with all sorts of booby-traps so you can't open them up, and why the
algorithm is secret.

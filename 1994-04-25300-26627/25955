I find that almost as disgusting as  I do surprising.

I just wanted to go on record as saying that my personal policy is the
opposite (not that I expect anyone to care).  I presume you may publish,
at any time, in any context, any email I have sent you, for any reason,
UNLESS I specifically asked you not to.  You should further assume that
I will treat any email you send to me as globally publishable, unless
you explicitly advise me otherwise.

I'm not refusing to respect anyone's copyright.  I'm just saying
that I think the default is backwards.  Normally, confidentiality
is not necessary.  Unfortunately, it seems to be that PRECISELY in
those cases when it IS necessary, is when things are SO complicated
and sensitive and important that people may, in the heat of battle,
forget to include the clause invoking their copyright.  To spare us
THAT atrocity, the legal default is that it's protected.  This
default I do NOT respect.  Around here, the default is open in both
directions, in all times and contexts.  It is up to you to request
exceptions.  These requests will normally be honored.

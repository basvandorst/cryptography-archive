I believe this is the real threat of the Clipper chip.  Actual
wiretapping of voice conversations requires people to listen to what's
being said and decide whether it's interesting.  This costs a lot of
money, and may be part of the reason that wiretaps aren't used very
often.

In practice, the ability to monitor (in real time) who is talking to
whom, would be even more valuable than wiretaps for tracking
"criminal" activity.  With Clipper, this could be done entirely with
automatic machinery for very low cost.  This capability would dovetail
quite well with the FBI digital telephony proposal's requirement to
provide call setup data.

All of the key escrow stuff makes good flame bait to distract
attention from the other (perhaps worse) danger posed by Clipper.
When the public demands it, the powers that be can make the key escrow
mechanism itself much safer (more escrow agencies, key split among
more parties, etc) without doing anything to address the fact that the
sender/recipient IDs are sent in cleartext.

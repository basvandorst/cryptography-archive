My company is seriously considering licensing RSA technology for some
of our products. As we are researching this, I have come up with a
few questions for the net.community:

1) Could anyone who has had experience dealing directly with RSA
   relate their experiences to me (either publically or privately)?
   How hard are they to deal with?

2) I have read the sci.crypt FAQ files and found them informative,
   but I am also looking at the "Answers to Frequently Asked Quest-
   ions About Today's Cryptography" from RSA Laboratories that was
   sent with the information packet from RSA. Is most of this info
   correct?

3) I understand that DES is not approved by the NSA for use in
   classified government communications. We hope to sell into that
   sector. What encryption algorithms are normally used in this
   case?

4) Are RC2 and RC4 any good?

5) Will I make my life easier if I contact NSA now, or should I
   wait for them to contact me?

I would particularly like to be contact by anyone who has gone
through the RSA licensing process before.

Thanks in advance for any information.

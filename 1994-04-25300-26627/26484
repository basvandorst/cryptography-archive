using the quadratic seive, it takes roughly a factor of 10 more
computing resources (disks & cycles, if not keyboards) to factor
each additional 10 digits. further, that factor of ten becomes
available in off-the-shelf workstations every 2-5 years. in
practice, the biggest factorable number has been growing by about
10 digits per year, thanks in part to algorithmic improvements.
i (and others) figure 512 bits will become inadequate by the late
'90's. at the crypto '93 conference, where rsa-120's demise was
announced (it took 1/6 as much resources), people were already
recommending the move to 768-bit or 1024-bit rsa keys.

it's not yet possible to guess at what it would take to crack
a 1024-bit key, because the general number field sieve, which
will eventualy/soon replace the quadratic seive as the fastest
factoring algorithm, has unknown constants in its complexity-
growth curve. once gnfs sees some use, those constants will get
pinned down a little, and such predictions will then be more
possible. here, i'm paraphrasing what i heard last year at crypto.

Summary: What encryption is

In simplest terms, encryption needs be no more than an XOR function.
The hard part is deciding what to XOR with (strength), making sure
the DE can decrypt (key managment), and that no-one else can.

As a result, you have a choice: predetermine a sequence of sufficient
length to handle messages and the encryption can be very fast or real-time
in which the encryption must be at transmission speed (and which usually
requires hardware).

In a recent posting the conjecture was made that Clipper is a power hog.
The data that was published last year did not support that (at least you
can't cook hamburgers on it) but that it uses more than the typical device
is not suprising considering the amount of parallel processing going on.

A book code is the most secure so long as the identity of the book
is kept secret. If the book is known (as in public key), the strength
must lie in the difficulty of attack.

Some of the postings seem to be missing these facts as many are missing
the fact that nothing can be determined about something until you have
one to play with. I have ViaCrypt (US legal PGP) but do not have a Clipper.

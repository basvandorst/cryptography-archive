There was a report in Information Security Monitor, February
1994, about a male nurse in a British hospital altering prescriptions. 
" A  nurse in England was sentenced to one year in jail after
gaining unauthorized access to a hospital computer and altering
patient records.
According to prosecutors, Dominic Rymer changed a nine-year-old
meningitis patient's records to induce other nurses to administer
heard disease drugs to the child. Following his arrest, officials
discovered that Rymer had hacked into the hospital's IBM
mainframe and altered other patient records."

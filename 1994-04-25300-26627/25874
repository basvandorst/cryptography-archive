   The problem with fixed s-boxes is that attackers can spend long
periods of time examining their statistics and designing possible
attacks against them.  The problem with key-generated s-boxes is that
the cipher designer *can't* do that kind of analysis himself.  Keys
that generate weak s-boxes are likely to be hard to test for directly.
A subtle weakness that occurred just once per 1000 keys would make the
cipher essentially worthless.
 
   All that said, I'm inclined to think that key-generated s-boxes, when
used well, are probably able to give greater security than fixed s-boxes.
They're also cheap to implement in software.
 
   Can anyone give me a simple, top-level description of how BLOWFISH
works?

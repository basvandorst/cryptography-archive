I have a real-life problem to do with anonymity, and I figured this was
the best newsgroup to get an answer.

An organisation I am associated with is going to send a questionnaire to
all its members. In order to encourage people to return them, we are
going to select one at random and give its sender a small prize
(sufficient to motivate them to return it, but not enough to make serious
fraud a problem).

At the same time, we want the questionnaires to be anonymous and to be
seen to be anonymous.

If the answers were being returned in person, this would be easy. When a
person brings their answer back, they get to pick a ticket from a bucket
(so that the person collecting the answers doesn't know which ticket
they got). However, the questionnaires are being posted back.

The members are not computer- or mathematical- literate, so schemes
involving complicated numerical operations can't be used; it has to be
something the "man in the street" can cope with.

Can anyone help ?

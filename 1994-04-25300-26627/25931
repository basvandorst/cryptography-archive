Given the appearance of various software tools for analysing traffic
data, it is a topic of interest to the law enforcement types.  If you
look at the demos for Harlequin's Watson analysis tool, you will find
bunches of telephone calls -- no content, just time and endpoint data.
This is combined with as much physical evidence as they can collect to
build the final case, but the traffic analysis is used to direct the
more expensive forms of survielance. (I have aquaintances that work on
the product.  The demos have real cases at their roots, and the
interesting display bugs that crop up are from the LE sorts dumping
thousands (literally) of call records into the system and sniffing
about the link diagrams looking for things that would connect groups
of people).

It looks like if we give them an easy way to capture traffic data,
they plan to use it.

Note: I have no idea which law enforcement organizations are doing
this, I have merely seen the sanitized demos, and hear a few war
stories of the form "5,200 calls, 100 numbers and the poor drawing
code died after 20 min of grinding"

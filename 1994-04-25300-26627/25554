   Did anyone describe why Bosch's PRNG is not secure yet?

   The attached version is not extremely fast, but it does
   very well on the statistical tests.  It was modified from
   a version posted by John Taber.  Basically, the primes   are bigger.

I'm not a sufficiently skilled cryptanalyst to break it for you,
but I *do* know enough to tell you that doing well on the statistical
tests isn't particularly meaningful - anything that *doesn't* do well
on the tests (for reasons other than, say, restricting the output to 6
or 7 bits/bytes for transmission safety) is obviously suspect,
but weaknesses that let you predict crypto input from the output don't
necessarily show up as statistically interesting patterns.

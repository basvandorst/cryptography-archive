What an amazing crypto algorithm!!!  It took a doubtlessly intelligent, well-
written, articulate treatise by an obviously astute intellectual and scholar,
and turned it into a rather pointless advertisement for sex toys and 
pornographic magazines!

At wholesale prices, no less!


Does anyone know what the plaintext was, and is the NSA aware of this algorithm?
(Maybe this is the output of Skipjack!!!!)

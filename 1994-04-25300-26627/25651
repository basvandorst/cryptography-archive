	Could someone please tell me what's the correct English term for the 
	phenomenon that secret encryption keys gradually "get old" and their
	risk to be revealed increases if not changed often enough?

I don't know if there is a single word or commonly recognised phrase
for it.  If you want a new one, how about "password rot" (cf "bit rot")?

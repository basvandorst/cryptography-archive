Hello all!

I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this kind of question,
but it sure looks like one.

Anyway, I'm looking for pointers to David Kahn's book, The Codebreakers.
For those who don't know it, it is supposed to be the history of cryptology
up until WWII. I'm looking for the 1967 edition, since it is supposed to be
more complete than the 1974 one.

If anyone knows of any bookstores that might have it, or that might be
able to get i, please e-mail me. If there is interest, I can summarize
the responses.

Thanks in advance.

Fernando

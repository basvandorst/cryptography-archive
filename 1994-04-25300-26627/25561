   Yes.  This is what a stream cipher is.

If, by "good", you mean "cryptographically strong", then it may be ok.
However, if you only mean "one of the usual random number generators
found in computer simulation textbooks", then, no.  There are some
good papers out about how to break linear congruential generators.
Also, if you have known plaintext at the beginning of a message,
you can XOR it to get the PRNG output, predict the rest of the stream,
and crack it all, even with strong random number generators,
as long as they're of the form  X(i+1) = F(X(i)) for known F,
since you're finding out X(i) for some small value of i.

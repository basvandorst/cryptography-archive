Looking at the IDEA source code, it looks like the POSSIBILITY of doing so
was provided for in the way the length of the key schedule is computed,
although the number of rounds is also hard coded as 16 with a comment not to
change this number.

For someone supposedly "knowledgeable" to (allegedly) suggest such a thing
would seemingly imply that there's some hidden weakness in IDEA that would
render it succeptible to something other than a brute force attack, since
doing that with a 128 bit key is a virtual impossibility, at least during
any of our lifetimes.

   Last year there was an interim report about Skipjack
   algorithm, done by five civilians.

   Where is the final report about the Skipjack ?

Actually, it was supposed to be about the whole Clipper chip, not just
SkipJack; the interim report only covered SkipJack.
I sent mail to Dorothy Denning about it a month or so , since she's
one of the authors, asking whether the final report had come out yet;
she said it should be out Real Soon.

My personal opinion (which is why I'm cross-posting to talk.politics.crypto)
is that the interim report accomplished the real purpose of the review,
which was propaganda - they could point at the glowing interim report
so they could say that independent experts thought it was good stuff
and make it a "standard", in spite of the fact that the interim report only
covered the strongest part of the system (skipjack) and didn't address the
seriously bogus parts, and any mistakes or deficiencies anyone pointed
out could be attributed to it being only an interim report and not final.

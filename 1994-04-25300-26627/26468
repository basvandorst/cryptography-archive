   I've been playing around with Boucher's PRNG design.  It seems pretty
tough to break, but I'd like to see a suggestion for filling all those
state-words up--I think there would be attacks available, for example, if
a simple software-simulated LFSR were used (the kind that simulate 32
parallel LFSRs).
 
   One comment:  The internal state variables' bits are never affected by
any bits to their left, because only 32-bit addition without rotation is
ever used to update them.  I don't see a useful attack based on this,
though it *does* seem like a bit of a weakness.

The Software Law Journal took over the Computer/Law Journal, and is 
changing names (I don't remember the new name).  Supposedly Mr. Scott is 
going to still be putting out the last two issues of the Computer/Law 
Journal which he had already committed to and been working on.  However, 
since one of those issues is supposed to include my paper and Mr. Scott 
hasn't returned one of my phone calls in the last six months or so, I 
doubt any more will be seen of the Computer/Law Journal...

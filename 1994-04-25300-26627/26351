Nope. There are only two sources of "rights"--Natural Law, and the Social
Contract. Our social contract is the Constitution and the laws that are
enacted by our elected representatives.

Catholics, among others, believe in natural law, and some of the founders of
the Republic appealed to natural law as one basis for the social contract.

Nothing in natural law entitles one to crytography, escrow-free or not.
Nothing in natural law entitles you to telephones, computers etc.
There is no "right to privacy" in natural law.

Thus the sources for such things lie in the social contract. So far the
government has, under its Constitutional authority, created the ITAR with
respect to exports, done Clipper, etc. etc.

Since the sources of governmental authority in those areas is the social
contract, the only way to modify those acts is via the mechanisms provided
for in the social contract--namely lobbying Congress to get them to act to
remove or modify those authorities the administration now has. An attempt to
reject or overthrow the social contract based on the issues we're discussing
would be uh, er, umm, unrealistic.

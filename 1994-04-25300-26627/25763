 The term von Neumann computer has its origin in the memo proposing
the stored-program computer EDVAC (The names of the engineers Eckert
and Mauchly was omitted from the memo at distribution and it is claimed
they have been given far too little credit for this[1]). According to
this book I have [1] the term Harvard architecture was coined during
Howard Aiken's work on Mark-III and Mark-IV at Harward. Aiken built
Mark-I "While work on ENIAC went forward". My conclusion is that the
von Neumann computer predates the Harvard architecture.
 It is important to distinguish the original meaning of HA, two completely
separate memories, from the meaning it is often given today, two separate
caches but a single main memory.
 To deduct which of the different Harward architecture notions that is the
most vulnerable to {virus,vorm,trojan}-attacks, I leave as an exercise to
the readers... (:

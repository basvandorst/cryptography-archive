How useful is an analysis of the randomness of ciphertext in determining 
the strength of a crypto scheme?  I know for example, that a scheme that 
that isn't "very random" is suspect.  But suppose you take a LARGE 
plaintext and repeatedly encrypt it using the same algorithm each time, 
using a different key for each trial, and collecting each of the 
ciphertexts for analysis.  Would the relative randomness of the outputs 
obtained be related to the "strengths" of the keys, or lack thereof?

Also, just out of curiosity, is there a crypto scheme that produces output 
that's more random than DES, but which is decidedly weaker (excluding 
one-way hash algorithms)?

In my field we have to use supercomputers such as the CM-5. However
if we really want speed for special applications, we design VLSI
devices which are much more efficient. Moreover, this technology
has advanced to the point that our government and some European consortiums
have factories that can produce these chips very quickly from a design.
The computers that broke RSA-129, no matter what they are, are not
very fast at all compared to what is easily (and cheaply) built for
special purposes. Just to put this is discussion in some better
perspective about what is feasible computationally now. (Keep in mind
that the best general-purpose supercomputer chess programs are much less
efficient than custom VLSI designs (by a large factor).

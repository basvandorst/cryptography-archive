Is there a list or profile of what instructions and algorythms are used
most in cryptography?  I mean instructions in the most general sense, not
just the CPU instructions but techniques such as factoring primes, XORing
against a table etc. 

Another way I might ask this question is "What functions would the ideal
crypto friendly processor/accelerator have?"

Are there any books that address this?

Most computers are virus proof; it's just PCs that are not. PCs, or I should
say MS-DOS systems, have the property that the operating system is in the same
domain as applications; thus applications can muck with the operating system.

In most other systems (for example, most Unixii), the operating system runs in
a different mode, and application programs cannot tamper with the operating
systems. This is one of the characteristics of a Reference Validation
Monitor--that it is tamperproof. Anything with this characteristic should be
immune from viruses that attack the operating system.

If you are concerned about viruses that infect application programs, there are
also ways to do this; primarily by increasing the integrity controls on a
system. This is often done in trusted systems.

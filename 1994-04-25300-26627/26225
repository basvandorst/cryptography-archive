I've been working on an idea for a remote secure login protocol, 
and I'm wondering if it's any good. It is based on the assumption 
that verifying quadratic residues mod n is easy only if you know 
the factorization of n.
 
p and q are two large primes. p,q is the private key, and n=pq is 
the public key.
 
The remote host only knows n.  The user to be authenticated knows 
p and q.
 
The remote host generates a random number j and then flips a coin.  
If the coin is heads, the host transmits j^2 mod n (which is 
guaranteed to be a quadratic residue), and if it's tails the host 
transmits n-j^2 mod n (which will be a quadratic non-residue).
 
The user responds with 1 if he thinks he has received a QR, 0 
otherwise; this is easy enough if he knows the factorization of n.
 
After answering "enough" challenges correctly,  the host 
authenticates the user.
 
Question 1. I am assuming that a bogus user, who does not know the 
factorization of n, can only guess if a number is a QR with a 50% 
chance of being right.  Is this correct?
 
Question 2. Can a chosen ciphertext attack break the scheme? I.e.,
can the host generate numbers such that, if it's known that they 
are QR's, then the host can deduce the factors of n?
 
Question 3. This seems awfully simple compared with a ZK scheme 
like Fiege-Fiat-Shamir, so I suppose somebody has already thought 
of it.  Can someone point me to a reference for it?

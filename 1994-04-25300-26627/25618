Did you ever read Sheymov's book (*)? I don't know how far, precisely, they
where on cryptography, but I am absolutely conviced that the KGB put a *LOT*
of effort in this domain, and remember than it was (and remains) the most
efficient institution of the whole USSR (CIS).

Shemov mentions that they used one time pads during the sixties. He
also mentions that, at that time, their cipher mechanism were
electromechanincal at that time.  They were however enclosed in
special secure shells which look pretty impressive.

It is possible that the current US cipher systems are more
sophisticated than the current soviet ones, but it is only a
possibility. Even if it were true, I am sure that their mathematical
methods are on a par with the best ones used in occident, and that their
devices work very well.

Shemov claims that he has been a KGB officer in the eighth directorate (the
one in charge of cipher communications and of their security). His job was
to be a troubleshooter everywhere. So, he had to know a lot of things about
the KGB. He especially knew the whole structure of the organization. He
succeeded in leaving sovietunion (and the KGB) at the beginning of the 80s.

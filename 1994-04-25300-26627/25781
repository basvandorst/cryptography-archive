Believe it or not, 'a rumor going around in DC' is that they claim we
were reading Saddam's traffic during the war.  One reason non-Clipper
crypto would be so bad is the fall back communications available to
Bad-People-Like-Saddam would be things like the AT&T Secure Phone.  And 
this would be bad for National Security unless such phones are 'back
door phones'.

Would anybody care to comment on the security of Peter Gutmann's
Secure File System 1.0, given that it is based on the SHA/SHS that
has apparently been broken by the NSA.

If the security is threatened could the author please comment on
the prospect of a upgraded version of SFS being released, with the
new SHS that has been strengthened.

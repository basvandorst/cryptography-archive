|The major aspects of PGP from a cryptanalytic point of view are:
|	Generation of the session key
|	Encryption of the session key with RSA
|	Encryption of the message with IDEA (using the session key)
|	Generation of the message digest with MD5
|	Signing of the message digest with RSA
|	Authentication of the RSA public keys

Ken, that seems like a good summary of the cryptanalytic point
of view.

Another security aspect of PGP is vulnerability to spoofing.
An adversary could spoof a sender by forging the message
providing the public key, causing the sender to encrypt
using the adversary's public key, rather than the 
recipients.

I suspect this is the biggest security problem facing those
PGP users who use PGP for encrypting data sent over Internet,
and who have adversaries to begin with.

(The users without adversaries, well obviously they don't
have anything to worry about...)

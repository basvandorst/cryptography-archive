Some will say yes, some no.  The government has stolen many of our 
constitutional rights over the last fifty years.  A search warrant only allows
them can look for certain specific items at certain specific locations. If
you write it down and they find it, they got it.

However many judges believe you must do what ever they say, and they will 
abuse their public trust to coerce you.

The 5th Amendment definitely says you do not have to say (and by extension--do)
anything to incriminate yourself.  In practice, it depends on how tough you are.
Can you look them in the face and say, no?  When they say you have to, can you say
no?  When some local judge puts you in jail, for a little while, can you take it?
Some can and some cann't.

The constitution is not a piece of paper. That "piece of paper" is nothing.  Its
the ideas it inspires that is the real constitution.  The constitution was created
to help the people prevail against the government.  We should not be suprised to
find ourselves pitted against the govenment when we use it. That is exactly what
it is for.

Marc Rotenberg is the head of the Washington Office of Computer
Professionals for Social Responsibility, and he was the one who got
most of the quotes for the privacy side. He had the cpsr mug right
behind him. Jerry Berman, from the Electronic Frontier Foundation,
also got a quote.

Actually, I think he said "it would be easy to classify this as simply
spies vs. nerds, but the truth is...." which let him make the
statement while guarding himself against vacuousness.

The author was Philip Elmer-DeWitt, who is on the Internet a fair amount,
because you can see his posts on occassion. You might want to write him.

Peace,

It never got past the RFD stage.  After consultation with various parties 
(including David Lawrence), the proposal was dropped.  Unless there's been 
some great change in people's positions since then (which I doubt - if 
anything the S/N ratio here has got better with talk.politics.crypto 
absorbing many of the junk postings), I suspect the current proposal will 
run into the same fate.  
 
The problem is that once the RFD hits news.groups, the whole proposal will 
become swamped with shouting from about a dozen different splinter groups 
who want a moderated sci.crypt.research, a moderated sci.crypt, a moderated 
s.c.r and an unmoderated comp.crypt.sources, a moderated s.c.r and an 
unmoderated s.c, no change at all because of namespace pollution, and 
several other variants of the above.  Since every group is completely 
convinced that their point of view is the right one, there'll never be 
enough votes for any particular proposal to pass, because everyone else will 
vote against it (or at least that's what people indicated in postings and 
private mail the last time round).
 
Having said that, if by some miracle the vote passes, I'd be happy to act as 
one of the moderators, especially for source code and whatnot which may 
cause problems if posted from the US.
 
Peter.

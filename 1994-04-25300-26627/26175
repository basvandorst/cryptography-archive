My understanding of compression schemes is that they increase the entropy
of a data set.  In other words, they level out the peaks and valleys into a
"flat" field of information packets all having equal probability of
appearing at any given instant.  If this is correct, a well encrypted
signal should already exhibit this "flatness" and therefore offer little or
no opportunity for compression.  This view would be consistent with your
intuitive understanding that you can't keep indefinitely encrypting and
compressing and achieve any gains.

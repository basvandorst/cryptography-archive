	One question is, since the 2 escrow keys sections combine to form an
80 bit escrow key, and that each key is only 40 bits, doesn't that mean that
with only 1 escro key, a brute force search of the key space is 2^40?  Isn't
this a significant vonerability?

	Why aren't both haves 80 bits, and need to be XORed together to
work, so that 1 key part doesn't help?  Apart from mindless speculation
about the NSA wanting to read things, what reason would there be for this
kind of decision?

	Also, why 80 bits instead of 128?  (A more convenient number for
modern computer software people)

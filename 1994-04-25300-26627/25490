I agree with you for the most part. S-tools however hides data within
a soundfile, which (if excecuted properly... s-tools does not) could
randomize enough to still follow gauss-markov assumptions, not setting
off any statistical bells and whistles.

As for actually telling Law enforcement officers that the data is there
is a whole different ballgame. For the most-part, since we are talking
about passive taps, things like this could slip by local enforcement
quite easily. - especially, if as an earlier post recommended, 
encrypting with an RSA derivative prior to soundfile incorporation.

Since I've never actually had a search warrant against me, do warrants
for computer information include a requirement for the owner to 
hand over any password/key information?

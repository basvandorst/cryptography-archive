Yes, the US military did some work on this. A search of `Security Reviews'
reveals, from volume 2 number 2 (June 1993):

`Communicating with chaos'
S Hayes, C Grebogi, S Ott
Phys. Review Letters v 70 no 20 (17 May 1993) pp 3031 - 3034

The authors report using a chaotic oscillator to encode information.
This had two attractors in phase space whose values at predetermined times 
encode `0' and `1' respectively; small control perturbations can be used to 
drive the output temporarily into the required region. More complex oscillators
can be used to hide multiple signals in seemingly random noise.

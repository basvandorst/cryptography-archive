Excuse my ignorance here, but what damage could have been done to
Clipper?  Is there some weakness in the algorithm that the Russians
could exploit to listen in on U.S. citizens, or is it just that
the Russians would be able to build Clipper compatible, non-escrowed
systems? If the latter, what's to be gained by starting over?

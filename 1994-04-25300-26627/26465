   Either you or they got it wrong - RSA-129 has been broken, not RSA.
   RSA-129 is one 129-digit N=P*Q combination, which has now been factored.
   (Yee-hah!  Good work, folks!)  Total work was about 8000 MIPS-years,
   if I remember the number right.  So that suggests that if you use a
   384-bit RSA key, the NSA or a bunch of volunteers could break it in a
   few months.  If you use 512-bit, you're probably safe for now.
   1024-bit is fine.

Actually, we think its closer to 5000 MIP-years, +/- 1K (depending
on what you call a MIP)

I'd like to see the CNN broadcast, if anyone has a copy, or knows where
I can get a copy.

Thanks!

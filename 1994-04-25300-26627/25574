I was thinking about using FFTs as part of an encryption scheme, but 
I realized that the decrypted (via inverse FFTs) data would not be 
exactly the same as the original due to rounding errors.  This would 
provide a lossy encryption, analgous to lossy compression.  If error  
detection and correction bits were added to the original data, the 
lossy encryption could be rendered "lossless".

Are there any lossy encryption schemes in use today?  What are the 
advantages/disadvantages to the concept of lossy encryption?  Is this 
a silly idea or not?

Dave

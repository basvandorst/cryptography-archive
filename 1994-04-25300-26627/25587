Last summer I had a job dealing with law enforcement
examination of seized computer media.  Law enforcement
agencies occasionally find encrypted files, and they are not
able to get suspects to reveal keys by court order.

: [...] something like "personal diary
: detailing named individual's contact with Joe Smith" and you refuse to
: decrypt a file called "diary.des", then this is analogous to situations
: where the courts have ordered individuals to open locks to execute
: search warrants. [...]

There is a big difference between warrants and subpoena for
physical items and information which is only in the mind of
the suspect.

: >The 5th Amendment definitely says you do not have to say 
: >(and by extension--do) anything to incriminate yourself.

: No, the courts have held that a person can be compelled to provide keys
: to storage lockers, samples of hair or semen, speak in the presence of
: witnesses for a voice check, etc.

The "(and by extension--do)" part I would disagree with, but
if the key is not written down it does fall under fifth
amendment protection.

   Hold that thought.  This is the chief reason that cryptosystems
based on combinations of algorithms are usually flawed.  If one of the
transformations is secure, the message is secure, unless the added
complexity either exposes an unanticipated attack or causes problems
in the protocol.  Read the American Black Chamber (or was it "The
Education of a Poker Player"? in any case Yardley) for at least one
instance where changing keys and retransmitting the message in the new
key allowed both old and new systems to be cracked.

   I'm also trying to remember the source of a very telling line about
stripping off superencipherments from messages in code.  (I think this
was in connection with the Zimmerman note.) It mentioned in passing
that this was work normally given to trainees as practice...

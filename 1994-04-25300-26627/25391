	Does this group have a FAQ?  I read about PGP in Wired and and
about its relation to factorization of large primes in "Problems in
Mathematics" by Ian Stewart, but I am still a bit fuzzy on how this
system works and how to implement it on my Mac.  I downloaded MacPGP
from one of the archives, but I couldn't figure it out.  CAn anyone
help?  Thanks in advance.

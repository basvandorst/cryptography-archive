Though this is true in theory, as someone at an engineering school it would
be useful if you addressed the practical aspects.

They include key length that's practical (in terms of machine time for
widely-used machines to decrypt and encrypt) in a give year; and speed and
number of processors in massively parallel processor machines such as the
64,000 processor Connection Machine or specially constructable ones within
the power of, say, the Federal Government in that same year.

A sketch of such an analysis by Ron Rivest is contained in the Fall 1993
RSADSI newsletter. Calibrating a 64000 processor Connection Machine's
solution time based on the RSA-129 accomplishment, it may be that his
conclusion, that 200 decimal digits (665 bits) will suffice for a standard
25-year lifetime key, may be weak. Comments?

Putting it another way, wasn't it Rivest or one of his colleagues who
thought it would take about 400 years to break RSA-129, about ten years ago?

: RSA can use innumerable different keys. One medium one
: has been broken. Do your self a favor and do not put
: in "429" when PGP asks how long you want your key to
: be. That way, it won't somehow pick one that's been
: factored.

429 bits reduces to prime factors of about 69 decimal digits:

There are around 10^69 numbers of length 69. Of those around 0.7% to 1.0% 
is prime. This gives you around 0.5 * 10^138 possible keys. The chances
are quite small :-) that you'd get the one that has already been cracked.

If you mean the meet-in-the-middle attack, saying it needs "a lot
more memory" than brute force against single DES is the understatement
of the week.  It takes 2^59 bytes of memory which must be accessible
at the speed of the brute force searcher (i.e. you want 1 million
parallel search machines, *each* of them must have that much memory,
modulo some optimizations).  There's not enough memory in the whole
world to mount even one such attack and there won't be any time soon.
For the time being, this attack seems to be of theoretical interest
only.  Double DES should be safe from it for the forseeable future
(e.g. rest of the decade at least).

This question came up recently in a discussion.  Is there any way to get a
rough count of regular readers.  (No.  Everyone who reads this message sending
me e-mail is NOT a good idea.)

I've heard of something called "arbitron," which comiles a count of people
who subscribe to a given newsgroup and are reasonably cought up.  Perhaps we
can take a poll on a hundred or so machines and assume that is a
representitive sample.

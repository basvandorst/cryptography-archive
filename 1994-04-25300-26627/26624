The 4/13/94 LA Times (pD8) describes a 2D system developed by United
Parcel Service called MaxiCode.  They plan to use it to track packages
and such, and they have also developed a high speed reader that can read
MaxiCode labels as packages whiz along a conveyor built.  Apparently they
system can store about 100 bits/square inch and is resistant to damage
(i.e., missing information on torn labels).

   The fact that strong crypto is for sale does not mean that strong
crypto is not available, for free, to everyone.  There may be
questions about whether the patents on public-key encryption are
valid, but private key methods are freely available that have equal
security. (Better for some, if you can assume that the opposition
doesn't know the number they need to factor.)

   At lunch yesterday someone asked me for a system that could be used
to provide passwords for a remote system.  The passwords would be sent
via amateur radio, so an efficient system where never the same password
was sent twice was needed.

   No problem to design at lunch, the biggest issues to be resolved
were speed space tradeoffs on the remote system.  Since the users
could be in the field we made it convenient to use the system with
pencil and paper (or even just paper) without a personal computer or
even a calculator.

   Modern cryptography has progressed to where such tailored systems
are state of the practice, not state of the art.  (The underlying
mathematics had better be clearly tied to a "known" hard problem,
since the system will not be extensively tested.  I'm always amazed at
the number of proposed cryptosystems which can't be tied in this way.
It make thing so much easier to be able to say that "this is at least
as hard to crack as RSA with the same key length," and prove it.)

   Now multiplying 512-bit numbers may not be something you do for
fun, and it is much easier with a PC, but it can be done easily with
second hand systems in the $300 range.  Do you really claim that that
makes it a privilege of the rich?  (Actually, now that I think of it,
several libraries in our area have "public" computers, or coin
operated systems--it may only cost you the price of a few floppy
disks, and perhaps some quarters.)

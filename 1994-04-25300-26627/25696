i have written a dos program to do this. i put a uuencoded version on 
this forum just today.

if you want me to mail you a copy or something you can e-mail me at

shaggy@phantom.com


my program is called hide-and-seek---look for hideseek.zip.

it scatters data through the GIF file ina pseudo-random way, and can be 
"locked" with a password ("key") so that you cannot get it out without 
knowing the key. it is limited to 19K of data per gif. you need vga to 
use it.



i am looking for ftp sites to put iton as well....anyone have any 
suggestions? i think it may be on soda.berkeley.edu already.......

Attention: CypherWizards

I have a compressed tar file that was crypt'd using the old Unix crypt
utility. CBW can perform attacks on non-compressed files. Does anyone
know of a utility or hack that performs analysis on compressed crypt'd
files? I know its possible but has anyone every played with it?

Thanks much!

Let's see... 5000 mips years, that's uh... how much in NSA mips time?

a day?
an hour?
a minute, maybe?

Clearly, the security provided by 428 bits has been vastly overrated.
And it gives one pause even for the larger bit sizes.

What's that sound... 
ahh, the sound of assholes puckering up across the world.  ;)

   The cryptosystem used below can be broken with unknown plaintext

Description and challenge deleted.

   If I end up posting a lot of these I'll probably use rec.puzzles
   instead of sci.crypt and just give a brief announcement in sci.crypt.
   (Unless there is a consensus that they belong here.)

   Comments are welcome.  Thanks.

Please do post challenges of this nature to sci.crypt -- cross-posting
to rec.puzzles is also a good idea, IMO, but they certainly belong here.

I'll have a go at your challenge.

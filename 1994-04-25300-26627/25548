I don't know.  I've never tried *that*,

They changed a few things, but it works just like the freeware version.

Only in a legal sense.  "ViaCrypt" appears in its banner, and the RSA
routines are, as required by their RSA patent license, their own creation.
So the mpilib.c file and maybe a bit of other stuff, has been replaced.

Yes.

I don't know.

Not at the moment.  Of course, any old PGP public key server will do.

I don't quite know what you mean.  I don't think they're in the business
of signing keys, if that's what you mean.

Yes, although bulk prices are available

Yes, although documentation for the language.txt file got left out.
It *is* PGP 2.3A for the most part.

I'd seen $100 (minus epsilon), myself.


Please note that I am in no way associated with ViaCrypt; I just happen
to know some of this stuff.

WADC was part of NACA. I think the contract was out of Lewis, but it might
have been Langley--it was in 1953-4.

The Principal Investigator was an MIT Professor of Aeronautics, named Hua
Lin. He did the aerodynamic equations; I did the computer work.

Since you're at NASA, and I'm sure they have a long memory check the library
files. Look for "Gust Loading of Flexible Swept-Wing Aircraft" and "Blast
Loading of Flexible Swept-Wing Aircraft", both with Lin's name on them. Let
me know what you find.

I still suggest composing original short poems.  Epigrams, couplets,
poemes en prose, things like that.  You can remember them indefinitely,

Avoid taking a definite stand on great public issues either in the Senate
or before the people.  Bend your energies towards making friends of key
men in all classes of voters.  -- advice to Cicero from his brother and

I don't think so.  But lets suppose an attacker is trying a known
plaintext attack.  How do you know that knowledge of the plaintext and
ciphertext doesn't give you some small peice of information about the
IV, which now gives you a peek inside the encryption of the previous
block.

I am nervous about using any internal information from the encryption,
in any way.  If you really want to do something like this, use all
eight rounds to produce the IV for the next block, and then an
additional eight rounds to produce this block's output.  Yes, it's
twice as slow.

The whole point of this exercise is to make use of a secret IV as kind
of an additional key, right?  But you already have 128 bits of key,
which you'll probably never use to its fullest potential anyway.

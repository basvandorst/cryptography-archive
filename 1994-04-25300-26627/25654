I have a fine article for you to read on the subject: get hold of tbe back
number of the Scientific American, Vol.?, 1979. The article is by Martin
Hellman and it addresses the problem of RSA & other number theoretic encryption
methods. Sorry for not being able to give you the page numbers but my copy
of the article seems to have disappeared...

[Rant mode on]
Would people stop referring to ways to generate "one time pads"
in software?  A one time pad should be a non-reproducible stream
of random numbers, save for the two copies made for encryption
and decryption.  What you want to know is "is this a good way
to make a cryptographically strong pseudo random number generator?"

It is infeasible to generate a one-time pad (secure or otherwise)
via software only.

Sorry, this was one time too many in the last couple of weeks.
I'll let a cooler head answer your [intended] question.

But if *you* have strong crypto, it does. Not all crackers are joyriding.
Besides, nobody can stop anybody from having strong crypto anymore.
Prohibiting crypto will be just like prohibiting alcohol, drugs, and guns.
It won't create health, well-being, or security.
It will only create criminals.
That's not what laws are for.

Such oppression probably being a price tag on things of value
that others have worked to make. Right?

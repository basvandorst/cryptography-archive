Crypto has made it to Barron's editorial (April 25, 1994, pg 51).  The
editor, Thomas G. Donlon treats the subject favorably from the point of
view of most of us.  He reviews problems of privacy with computers and
electronic communications.  Then he reviews RSA.  Finally he discusses
Government efforts to impede cryptography.

	At this point the cops and the spies show up.  The FBI and the
   NSA ... have treated the idea of uncrackable code as if it were the
   atomic bomb. ... The two agencies have convinced the Clinton
   administration to try to preserve their status quo...
	Unfortunately for the forces of law and order, the cryptography
   secret is just like the nuclear fission secret.  It's blown, absolutely
   and completely...
	...Although it still seems that computers created an age of
   snoopery, the age of privacy is at hand.

Give it a read.

Grady and others: Sternlight's views are explained fully explained by
the following:

On the other hand, the Constitution reads, in part:

>The Congress shall have  the  power  to
>lay  and  collect  taxes,..... To  define  and  punish
>piracies  and  felonies  committed on the high seas, and offences
>against the law of nations: To  declare  war,....

Such a fundamental mis-reading of the Constitution might explain a great
deal of Sternlight's views.  That this view has been shared by every
president since Truman, that we have engaged in no fewer than thirty
wars since the last, World War II, was declared, does not make it any
more constitutional.

And lives have been lost by the ability to read the good guys' crypto.

No blinders, David, just a calculation of risks. As I said before, the only
way to carry on your viewpoint is to ignore significant facts of existence.
Facts such as: the USA is hardly the only country in the world with PCs
and capable mathematicians. The battle is over, David, and you lose, if you
call the success of your viewpoint winning. I can easily reprogram the
microprocessor in my microwave oven to do strong crypto, using published
materials and my trusty ROM burner, none of which have export controls.

Besides, would the Japanese, or Saddam, or your terrorists use Clipper?
How silly can you be? "Oh, don't worry. Foreigners would never think to
<do something obvious and sensible>." Where is your mind today, David?

The only course now is to turn crypto from an offensive weapon to a defensive
one. Make it bulletproof and universal. Attempts to keep it from being that
can only be carried out by government control, for government control, and
in spite of the clear impossibility of government control. The results will
be local and unambiguously ugly.

BTW I want to point out, David, that Roosevelt explicitly arranged for
something like Pearl Harbor to happen, and there is good reason to think
he knew in advance what the something was.

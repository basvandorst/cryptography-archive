Well, you could set your swap drive to 0 bytes for the duration of your
coding. (If you have enough memory) Or the program could be really slick
and allocate and fill all available memory with zero when done this
filling the swap device with zeros as well. Of course, in most cases the
plain text file is already on your hard-disk. If someone has access to
your hardware there is only so much security to be had.

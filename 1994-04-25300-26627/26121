Try as I might to stay out of this topic, I can't let this statement go by.
While I agree with the notion that always conceiving the worst for a party
you don't agree with is not always the best argument method, I make an
exception when the Government is involved. What you must understand is that
the Government does not have our best interests at heart. No government
has, nor ever will. This is the nature of government coming from the fact
that government first arose from anarchy. We the people (in prehistory)
gave the first government rein over our free will. From that point forward
to gain more power a government must take from the citizen's freedom. It
manifests itself here, the government does not really need its "trapdoors."
Crime fighting would not grind to a halt, the "trapdoors" only make it
easier for law enforcement to operate. This strengthens the governments
power over its citizens, at the cost of the law abiding citizen's freedom.
Make no mistake about it, Government is run by humans with human failings.
Failings like greed, and power corruption. This Clipper issue is not a threat
by itself, but is a step in the possible line of government strengthening.

Sorry to sound paranoid, or full of conspiracy, but Government power is not
something to screw around with lightly.

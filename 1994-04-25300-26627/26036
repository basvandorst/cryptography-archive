The simple answer to your question about expanding "real random data" is
yes. It's actually fairly easy, quick and cheap.

A more serious question centers around understandings of what is meant
by random in the context of finite strings.  There is a lot of IMHO
gibberish written and ranted about what is "really random" and what is
*merely* mathematically random by people who knwo little about physics
and less about mathematics.

A good starting point for any discussion and understanding of how to
define and discuss randomness is probably Knuth's Seminumerical Algorithms,
a real classic and fairly easy to follow.  There is a lot more in the
more recent literature, but I think that Knuth gives a good fundamental
understanding of the complexities to defining and understanding what we
mean by the concept "random".

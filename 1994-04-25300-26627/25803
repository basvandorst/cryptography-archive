The traffic was decrypted in time; US policy-makers thought the messages
called for sabotage from Japanese agents on Hawaii, so they ordered that
all planes be put into a single group for easier guarding.  Made a great
target for the bombers, though.

Yeah, the US really needed to decrypt Saddam's war plans - our
satellites told us exactly where they were.

Stream-of-consciousness point number three:  the World Trade Center
bombers were perfectly capable of accomplishing their goal without
crypto and catching them after the incident is almost irrelevant.  Would
a suicide bomber willing to give his/her life for a cause care about
jail time?

Not only that, there is the issue of using taxpayers' money (fortunately
not mine...at least not yet) to subsidise the development of a crypto
device to give it an unfair advantage in the market, combined with selective
changes to the export rules to give it a further advantage in foreign
markets.  This disrupts the operation of the marketplace and make it much 
much more difficult for third parties to introduce competitive devices, 
thus reducing the choices people have in crypto gear that they can purchase.

(Not to mention the rumours that other forms of pressure may be/have been 
applied to companies thinking of producing non-clipper devices for general 
use.)

P.S. - I seem to recall that some of the information regarding Clipper 
implied that other escrowed-key methods would also benefit from the relaxed 
export rules.  Have they defined what they mean by escrowed-key methods?  

If someone were to offer an escrowed-key device in which one escrow agency 
was a Big-8 accounting firm and the other was a large New York law firm 
and further the escrow agencies agreed to publish in the New York Times 
(and on the Internet) all keys that had been released from escrow within 
(say) 24 hours of their release (along with the identification of the 
requesting party), I (a) think a lot of people would prefer this method 
to Clipper and (b) I expect that we might see some backpedalling on the 
offer to permit any escrowed crypto to be exported.

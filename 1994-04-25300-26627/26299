In my opinion, this is the only reason why our government will never make
the algorithm available to the public.  Without a complete monopoly on
communications, the key escrow system is pointless.  This is also a moot
point, since anybody can add layers of encryption on top of skipjack.
Sure, Uncle Sam, decrypt this stream with your escrowed keys... you still
don't have the plaintext.

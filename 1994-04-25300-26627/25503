   This question came up recently in a discussion.  Is there any way to get a
   rough count of regular readers.  (No.  Everyone who reads this message sending
   me e-mail is NOT a good idea.)

   I've heard of something called "arbitron," which comiles a count of people
   who subscribe to a given newsgroup and are reasonably cought up.  Perhaps we
   can take a poll on a hundred or so machines and assume that is a
   representitive sample.

This is a hard question.  I'm sure that there are many people who read
sci.crypt in mail, or get it through other means, or just lurk!
(Maybe sending you personal mail would be a good count. ;-)

Seriously, however, if you wanted, it might be possible to set up a
mail counter, similar to a Usenet vote, to count the number of people
who send mail.  Although I think it would be more interesting to see
how many people actively participate in sci.crypt conversations, so
counting the Posters might be a more useful task (and much easier :-)

My $.02.

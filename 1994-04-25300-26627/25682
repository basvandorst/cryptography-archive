Did anyone see the story on the McNeil/Lehrer news hour on PBS last
night about Clipper?  I'm just getting started in the area of
cryptawareness so I didn't recognize any names, but they made a few
errors I noticed.

They said CPSR stood for Computer Scientists for social
Responsibility.  They also characterized the Clipper debate as "geeks
vs. the NSA".  This is what bothered me most about the feature.  It
was a story by someone from Time magazine.  

They sort of glossed over the industry consortium against clipper,
like "oh yeah, and some computer companies are grouped together
against this".  Not like it's an important group of companies or
anything.  

Did anyone else see this and care to comment?

Ed

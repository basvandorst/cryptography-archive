      It's not, at least for English text.  Read up on Vernam cyphers.

      Resynching at random new positions every once in a while doesn't 
provide any real security.  To break this, you run a string of the text
against later text, XORing them together, and watch for when the triplet
statistics go non-random.  This gets you in sync.  4GB is a big range to 
search, but it's not overwhelming.

      This is a far weaker cypher than DES, although it does have the
advantage that you have to accumulate a lot of traffic to break it.

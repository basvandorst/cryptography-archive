When I looked at the B-Safe crypto toolkit from RSADS last summer,
it supported RC2 and RC4 with maximum key length of 64 bits.  Has
this changed ?  What range of key lengths can you use with these
ciphers ?  Do you know if the current toolkits support the full
range ?

And can you tell us what your "reason to believe" is?

Thanks.

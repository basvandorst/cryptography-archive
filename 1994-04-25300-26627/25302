AT+T has issued press releases touting it's new "Advanced Cellular Privacy
System", which they claim makes the call unintelligible if intercepted. 
They are showing the voice privacy modules connected to the phones, with
the decoding unit located at the MTSO (Mobile Telephone Switching Office). 
Obviously, since I work in the field, I am curious as to what type of
encryption their system uses.  If anyone has any details, I'm sure that
there are plenty of people listening....

Thanks,

doug

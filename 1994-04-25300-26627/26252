At present they have security through haystacking: if anybody wants to do a
mass scan of telephone traffic at TPC, it's darned expensive to process
thousands of voice converations in real-time.  With Clipper, the
conversations that people feel strongly about have been digitized and
packaged with a convenient LEAF to tell you <how> they've been digitized.

Naturally law enforcement doesn't work this way.  But if they <wanted> to,
the information would be waiting for them on a silver platter.

Less privacy.

In any case, with both Clipper and potential substitutes we're talking
mostly about future/potential systems, not the current setup.  Keeping
Clipper from getting a dominant market position would ensure the
possibility of having private calls in the future.

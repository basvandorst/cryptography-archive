As usual, when you talk about administrators, you assume they are following
administration guidelines that restrict programs to an approved set, as well
as restricting PATH. A MAC-based approach often helps here; such that
administrators do not have execute access to user programs. 

If you get an administrator that circumvents the guidelines, all bets are off.

The April 1st edition by any chance?

In a word, Bullshit.

There are any number of products or experiments with techniques that
try to "recognise or block viruses moving in a computer's memory".
Distinguishing real viruses from other valid system operations is
very hard.  In the end the best you can do is tune the system to
recognise known viruses and disregard known non-viruses.

There is no "virus-immune computer".

Nevertheless I'm interested in further information: is this for real?
has a patent been granted?  what is it's number?  ...

What is laughable is that you actually fear the government as a source
of oppression.  The government of this nation is impotent.
All power it has is derived NOT from the consent of the governed
(although the Democrats are trying to make it that way), but from
the spending of the rich (because the Republicans have kept it that way).
Strong crypto in the hands of anyone other than the government means
that the government is powerless against criminals who would abridge
your rights.  When criminals have guns, the fact that the government
has guns also is a big help.  But when ciminals have strong crypto, 
the fact that the government has strong crypto also DOES NOT HELP.

I do not fear oppression by the government.

I fear oppression by everybody else.

The only form of oppression the government commits
against me personally is failing to enforce its own
laws vs. members of the private sector when THEY oppress me.

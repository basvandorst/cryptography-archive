Well, in this country, people (organizations, really) have been known to send
out "nonymous" questionnaires with a secret code number printed on it in ink
that only shows up under ultraviolet light.  You could do that, and tell them
"you can win a prize, but you'll have to pretend you never figured out how we
knew it was you."

Why not ask each respondent (or respondant, I forget which) to tear off a small
corner on which there is a unique number.  A receipt, in fact.  Then mail out
the list of winning receipts (or receipt) to the original recipients.  In the
first mailing, tell them that because it /is/ anonymous, the only way they have
to be eligible is to mail back the questionnaire, and the only way they have to
claim the prize is with the receipt.

To get really fancy, insist they fill in a blank on the form as a "passcode,"
and then make them claim the prize by both number /and/ passcode, so that when
#12345 wins the prize you don't get a lot of people rushing to their laser
printers to print a scrap of paper that says "12345."

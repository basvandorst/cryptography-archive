I have personally watched data flow in a de-lidded chip under an electron
microscope.  There was an article on this in Scientific American.  You can only
see the data on the top metal layer...anything under that is invisible...if the
electrons can't get through it, you can't see it, so you have to strip off the 
top protective layer of the chip to get down to the first metal layer.

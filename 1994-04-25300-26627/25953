This is the REAL point.

Well, it will allow law enforcement to decrypt Joe Schmoe's
communication, iff Joe is too poor to afford anything better
than Clipper.  But that does not mean that bigger fish can't
be fried: they can just be hauled into court for daring to
have crypto that the government can't read.  They can be hit
a lot harder than Joe Schmoe can.  Joe Schmoe's private communication
may reveal him to be a child molester, but it may also prove that
he's NOT a serial killer.  In the case of the MegaCorp that can
afford better crypto, the government just says:" we don't know WHAT
the heck they could be doing!  It could be a threat to NATIONAL
SECURITY!  It could compromise the safety of our troops!"  If
THAT happens, poor MegaCorp has no security whatsoever -- it's
in much worse shape than Joe Schmoe, unless it owns a few 
Senators or Judges.  The people who can afford better crypto
might be in more danger from being publicly perceived
as a secret conspiracy, bent on undermining us, than they
would be from having their communication decrypted.

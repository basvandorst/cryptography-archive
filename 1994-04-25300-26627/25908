Is this still true when using CBC mode?  In CBC mode you have:
 
  c_0 = E(p_0 xor IV)
 
(where p_0 is the first plaintext block, c_0 is the first
ciphertext block).
 
Therefore even if you re-encrypt a different plaintext block with
the same IV, an attacker can't recover the new plaintext block,
even if he knew the old one (which is not the case in CFB mode)

SUMMARY:

          For improving the RSA cryptosystem, more desirable conditions
          on  key structures have been intensively studied.   Recently, 
          M.J.Wiener presented  a  cryptanalytic attack  on  the use of 
          small RSA secret exponents. To be secure against the Wiener's 
          attack, the size of  a  secret exponent $d$ should  be chosen 
          more than one-quarter  of  the size  of  the  modulus  $n=pq$ 
          (in bits).   Besides, it is more desirable, in frequent cases, 
          to  make  the  public  exponent  $e$  as  small  as  possible.  
          However if small $d$ is chosen first,  in  such case  as  the 
          digital signature system with smart card,  the size of $e$ is 
          inevitably  increased  to  that  of  $n$   when  we  use  the 
          conventional key generation algorithm.  This paper presents a 
          new algorithm, Algorithm I,  for generating of the secure RSA 
          keys  against  Wiener's  attack.   With  Algorithm I,  it  is 
          possible  to  choose the smaller sizes  of  the RSA exponents
          under certain conditions on key parameters. For example, with 
          Algorithm I,  we can construct  the RSA  keys with the public 
          exponent $e$  of  two-thirds and  secret exponent $d$  of one-
          third of the size of modulus $n$ (in bits).   Furthermore  we 
          present  a modified version of Algorithm I, Algorithm II, for 
          generating  of  the strong RSA keys having  the difficulty of 
          factoring  $n$.    Finally  we  analyze  the  performances of 
          Algorithm  I  and  Algorithm  II.

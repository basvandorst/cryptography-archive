  I don't, but then I also don't allow any old program access to supervisor
mode either. A few lines of code prevent any unauthorised proggie from 
issuing an OS_ENTRY call. Since I also don't allow apps to modify files
outside their own directory, virus protection is, as I said, trivial.
  The biggest danger with an Arc, is a virus that plays around with the
IIC bus. You can seriously bugger the machine if you know what you're doing.
I don't permit _any_ program to access this bus ....

I suggest to new users a compromise involving easy to remember "tricks" 
in combination with a "very obscure phrase".

Bad: Look see let's post noise to sci.crypt.

Better:

These are less than random, but far better than the original, and a hell 
of a lot easier to remember than dozens of random symbols. The point is 
to get the user to make up their own tricks then apply those to a 
memorable phrase. After all, security from accidental data loss or 
forgetting your pass phrase if you never write it down, is as much of a 
concern as someone cracking your pass phrase.

So given an obscure pass phrase, what are good tricks to apply, 
and which are worthless? Long completely random-like pass phrases just 
are not practical for most people who need an encryptor.

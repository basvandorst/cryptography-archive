The key word there is "specific item(s)".  If the search warrant says
"computer files" and you have a couple gigabytes of storage, that warrant
might well be ruled improper because it's too vague.  That's like
executing a search warrant for "employee records" against IBM.

(Factoid to drive this point home to legal types.  One page ~ 2 kbyte.
One file cabinet drawer is maybe 2,000 pages, or 4 MB.  One large file
cabinet is five drawers, or 20 MB.  That means a computer with 1 Gbyte
of storage (not uncommon today) is equivalent to about *50* filing
cabinents, far more than a single search warrant would ever cover without
a large team of cops and very careful consideration by a judge.  The
fact that much of this space is "inefficiently" used (e.g., one image may
be equivalent to 500 sheets of paper) is irrelevant.)

On the other hand, if "specific item" is something like "personal diary
detailing named individual's contact with Joe Smith" and you refuse to
decrypt a file called "diary.des", then this is analogous to situations
where the courts have ordered individuals to open locks to execute
search warrants.

However, you might be able to insist on decrypting the file immediately
and getting a determination if the file is covered or not; if not, the
file is reencrypted immediately.  If the cops say "yeah, sure, it's
covered" because they are too lazy to actually determine if the file is
covered, you could file suit (or a formal complaint) for official misconduct.

No, the courts have held that a person can be compelled to provide keys
to storage lockers, samples of hair or semen, speak in the presence of
witnesses for a voice check, etc.

Reasonable people might disagree with some of these arguments (e.g., the
idea the police can grab a urine sample when a suspect urinates, as though
an individual has the option of retaining urine for prolonged periods!)
but that's the way the courts are currently interpreting the Constitution.

Also, the Fifth Amendment protects you from a criminal trial, but it does
*not* protect you from a Grand Jury investigation in the states that still
use them.  You could make an argument that the search warrant can compel
you to reveal the password of encrypted data, leaving you with only the
option of attempting to prevent the contents of those files from being
revealed during the actual trial.

(ObDisclaimer:  I'm not a lawyer, and I certainly don't agree with all of
the conclusions, but I've been following this topic for a couple years and
have been watching MEU courses on Civil Liberties and Criminal Law in
my copious free time.  They're on from 10:30p - midnight Sundays, locally.)

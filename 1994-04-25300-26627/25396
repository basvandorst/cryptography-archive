Biham and Shamir looked at using an independent key for each round of
DES in their work on differential cryptanalysis of DES[*], and found
that increasing the key size in this way did not proportionally
increase the time to break DES.  Unmodified (56-bit key), it took 2^47
steps to break; modified for independent keys it took 2^64 steps.

16-round DES", Crypto '92.

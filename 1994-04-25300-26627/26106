I am jumping in on this, but I assume you are talking about the sector
incryptors for disk-drives.

I have thought about this a little, and It would seem to me that what you
need is a program, much like compress that runs in the background and
re-encrypts the whole drive periodicaly with a new iv based upon both the
sector and an incrimenting value stored in the program.

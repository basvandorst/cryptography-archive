Though you're certainly entitled to your opinion, far more likely than a
conspiracy theory is that one or more of the civilian authors (they ARE
academics) is being less than prompt about his part of the writing or review
of the final report. We do know that during part of the timetable at least
one committee member was out of the country.

I was Associate Editor of a major professional journal for some years, and
you'd be amazed at the delays in academics submitting agreed papers, or
revisions of drafts. It's sometimes like pulling teeth, and those academics
who are prompt are thought to be treasures and get published A LOT.

It isn't like the corporate world you may be used to, Bill.

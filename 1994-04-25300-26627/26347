	It has been told that the encryption algorithm A5 which is used 
in GSM digital mobile telephones is not publicly available. In other
words it might be secret. I wonder how the algorithm is implemented in 
the telephone, and whether the encryption is based on a special chip
as with the clipper or if it is a program running in the DSP. How
possible is it to find out the algorithm by reverse engineering? Do the
manufacturers of GSM equipment know the algorithm? 

	I have heard rumours that the algorithm is so weak that those
	knowing the algorithm feel it is risky to give it away.

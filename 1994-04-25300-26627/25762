Indeed.  I have heard (more information welcome) that in Germany, it is
illegal for the phone company to keep these records around *at all*.

Seems during the unpleasantness 50-60 years back, a lot of people were
hauled off to death camps based on who they had been talking to.  All
done in full accordance with the relevant laws and in line with
approved law enforcement procedures, of course.

The Germans do *not* want anything like that to happen again.

Something to think about.

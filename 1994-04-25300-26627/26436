I've just uploaded S-Tools for Windows v2.00 to the following places:

ftp.funet.fi		/pub/msdos/incoming
black.ox.ac.uk		/incoming

This latest version will now hide files inside GIF and BMP files with
little or no noticeable difference to the original. As an example, you can
hide a 114K file inside a 640x480 image and 295K inside a 1024x768 image.
The original capability of hiding files inside WAV files still remains.

In case you didn't know, S-Tools is a set of steganography tools for
Windows 3.1 that allows you to conceal your private and sensitive files
within Windows sound sample (.WAV) and graphics (.BMP and .GIF) files.
                                                              
I've made a few internal changes to the operation of the program, including
separating the crypto stuff into DLL's (see my separate announcement for
how to get hold of these as a programmer's toolkit). I've PGP signed the
main archive too (finger me for public key) so that the clinically paranoid
can verify that tall men in dark suits haven't been playing games with it.

Talking of the crypto stuff, it's all present in this release, i.e. you no
longer have to register to get it. Registration does get you the complete
source code though.

I think I've got some way towards solving the problem of pure white noise
appearing in the LSB's of the data. Instead of just linearly spreading the
bits to be hidden I now choose the `container' bits based on the output of
a random number generator. This means that an attacker cannot apply any
statistical randomness tests to the lower bits since modified bits will be
interleaved with non-modified bits. The RNG is based on repeated MD5
transformations of a value (also MD5) derived from the passphrase. As far
as I can tell this is the same as the RNG employed by RSAREF.

If you choose a sound wave or graphic that can hold a lot more than you are
hiding then the hidden file should be virtually undetectable since an enemy
has no reliable information on which to base an attack.

PS. If you don't have ftp access then I'll e-mail it to you -- just send
    me a request.

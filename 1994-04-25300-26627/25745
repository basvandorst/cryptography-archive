OK... Hard Facts follow:
Let me excerpt the Department of Justice's own 
procedures for getting escrowed Clipper/Skipjack keys...
**begin excerpt**

	3) The principal prosecuting attorney of such State or 
political subdivision of such State shall submit with the request 
for escrowed key components a certification that shall

		(a) identify the law enforcement agency or other 
authority conducting the interception and the prosecuting attorney 
responsible therefor; 

		(b) certify that necessary legal authorization for 
interception has been obtained to conduct electronic surveillance 
regarding these communications; 

		(c) specify the termination date of the period for which 
interception has been authorize;

		(d) identify by docket number or other suitable method 
of specification the source of the authorization;

		(e) certify that communications covered by that 
authorization are being encrypted with a key-escrow encryption 
method;

		(f) specify the identifier (ID) number of the key escrow 
chip providing such encryption; and 

		(g) specify the serial (ID) number of the key-escrow 
decryption device that will be used by the law enforcement agency 
or other authority for decryption of the intercepted 
communications.

	4) Such certification must be submitted by the principal 
prosecuting attorney of that State or political subdivision to 
each of the designated key component escrow agents.

	5) Upon receiving the certification from the principal 
prosecuting attorney of the State or political subdivision, each 
key component escrow agent shall release the necessary key 
component to the intercepting State or local law enforcement 
agency or other authority.

**end excerpt**

I don't know about all states as well as I do Ohio, but here in Ohio we
have literaly over a THOUSAND principal prosecuting attorneys of political
subdivisions of the State...in counties, cities, townships, villages, etc.

You will note the escrow agencies make no independent verification of
the assertions and certifications of these principal prosecuting attorneys.
They just release "upon receipt".

And you should further note (as has been previously discussed) that should
this system of "oh yes, we have good reasons to get Jane Citizen's keys"
be violated and/or ignored, Jane Citizen has no recourse. (That is in
another part of the DOJ rules...I can post it too if you wish.)

Can I go to town now? :)

(Note to non-US readers 'go to town' is a phrase meaning 
'make a big deal of', 'make a stink over', 'shout from the rooftops' :)

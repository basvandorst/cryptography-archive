There is an Enigma emulator available via FTP.  Not the same as the 
Purple machine, of course, but roughly similar in terms of what you can 
do with pre-computer technology (OK, not EXACTLY, but let's not pick 
nits here...they were both used in WWII is what I meant)

I don't have the FTP site handy that I got it from...I wanna say 
ftp.netsys.com, but I could be wrong.  If anyone is interested in it, 
e-mail me and I'll find the site.

The emulator itself is not a full-blown file-processor...it's mainly just 
a demonstration tool.  You can encrypt something like 40 characters of 
text, set the rotors, plugs, etc.  and watch the little rotors spin as it 
en/decodes.

Look at simple substitution ciphers, which includes DES and IDEA in
codebook mode.  The ciphertext will show precisely the same statistical
behavior as the plaintext; the only difference may be that the slot
previously occupied by " of the " will now be occupied by "1IuK$@$z".

That's one of the primary reason why ECB mode isn't generally used;
it's much easier to crack it regardless of your encryption technique
or key length.

In general, a ciphertext which shows statistical structure is going
to be easier to attack than one that doesn't, but that doesn't mean
that a ciphertext which appears "random" is necessarily stronger
than one which doesn't.  While not practical, there are some extremely
strong encryption techniques where entire sentences may be used to
encode a single character, or less.

For instance, imagine an encryption technique where the length of
the sentence (in words) modulo 2 provided a single bit of the
plaintext (compressed with a Huffman coding, to conserve bandwidth).
Your ciphertext could look like, and *be*, typical net chatter, yet
may encode "attack seoul".

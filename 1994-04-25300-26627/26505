SECDEV11.ARJ

SecureDevice version 1.1
by Max Loewenthal and Arthur Helwig

SecureDevice is a device-driver that will help you keep your private data
private. It creates 'extra drives' on your system that are accessible
just like normal disk drives, but everything you transfer to the volume
will be encrypted using the IDEA encryption algorithm, and when you
transfer data from the volume it will be automatically decrypted. The
encryption/decryption mechanism is transparant to DOS and other
application programs.

Features:
* Login by commandline or via a pop-up window
* Logout by commandline, timeout or hotkey
* Takes only 6k of memory (another 7k for pop-up windows and hotkey-close)
* May be loaded into high memory

WHERE TO GET IT:
Secdev11.arj is available from:
wuarchive.wust.edu : /pub/MSDOS_UPLOADS/cryptography/secdev11.arj

I've also uploaded it to ftp.funet.fi, but I don't know in what
subdirectory it will be placed. You can use 'SITE FIND secdev' to
search the ALL_FILES database there on your ftp> prompt.

You can also download or file-request SECDEV11.* from Fido node 2:512/56
(+31-15-568396 - 14k4 line)

I probably won't be able to read mail or news for the next 3 months.
Max Loewenthal will be monitoring my mail for me, and reply to all your
questions or comments about SecureDevice.

Yours,
Arthur Helwig

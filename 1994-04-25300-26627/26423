        That's not key escrow, it's key management and standard
        operating procedure. Someone (eg. the person who holds the
        spare keys to desks and filing cabinets) gets copies of all
        the data encryption keys, with appropriate references and
        protections.

        The kind of case that started this thread is what usually gets
        an organisation to put in some policies to do this. This one
        won't because Word is trivially breakable. They'll heave a
        sigh of relief and carry on as always. If they do something, it
        will probably be to make file encryption a career-challenging
        offense.

        Cheers,
                Marc

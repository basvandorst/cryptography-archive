Hi,

I've been playing telephone tag for several days with the NSA and the
Department of Commerce about whether MD5 (Message-Digest Algorithm 5
written by Ronald Rivest and outlined in RFC1321) is exportable from
the U.S.  I'm getting nowhere really fast and wanted to find out if
there's anyone that knows where I could find out some information.

What I would like to know is if anyone has submitted MD5 for a commodity
classification and, if so, what was the result.  A commodity
jurisdiction or case number would be very very helpful.  I've tried to
contact people at RSA with no results (yet).

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

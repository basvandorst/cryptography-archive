Naah. PGP (at least the Viacrypt version) is now a legitimate, mainstream
crypto system in the U.S. Sorry that Viacrypt spoiled the fantasy life of
the cypherpunks. I guess they'll have to find another "cause".

Maybe they can make "free" PGP a cause. Guess not--they'd have to shoot
Viacrypt in the foot to do that, and after ViaCrypt did what many of them
were calling for six months to a year ago.

I've got it. Why not make grades a cause? After all, they're required by the
authorities, they are discriminatory (against the terminally lazy or
stupid), and they are stored in "official" data bases. Yeah. That's the
ticket. Where do I sign up?

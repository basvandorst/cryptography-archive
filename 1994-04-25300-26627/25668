Did anyone on sci.crypt attend the fourth Computers, Freedom, and Privacy
Conference in Chicago last month?  If so, I (and perhaps others...) would
like to hear a summary of the events/speakers.  I have read a couple of
brief reviews in the  popular press, but was hoping for something a little
more in-depth.  I understand that the FBI provided some entertainment by
arresting a couple of conference-goers in two apparent cases of mistaken
identity. Any details???

I am particularly interested in statements made by NSA General Counsel
Stewart Baker regarding the Clipper proposal.  I am also interested in the
consensus regarding passage and/or legality of the FBI Digital Telephony
act (as we have seen it).  

Also, if someone in or near Chicago has any materials left over from the
conference that they might be willing to share, I would gladly arrange
pickup or reimbursement of mailing costs....

Thanks in advance,

doug

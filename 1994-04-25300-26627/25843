Forgetfulness rather than ignorance, as I've mentioned it to you before.

The key is that Data & Instructions are in seperate memory areas, normally
with no means of moving data to the instruction memory.  They only become
vulnerable to virus attacks if you implement a sufficiently powerful
interpreter, where a 'data' object can infect other 'data' objects.

They are very useful for dedicated tasks, but poor general purpose
computers as you need a second computer in order to modify the program
space.  They are therefore popular in a number of industrial, military
and space environments, (instrumentation, missile navigation systems,
...)

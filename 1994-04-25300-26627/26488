I don't think so. For the same key length, the 64,000 processor Connection
Machine DOD is said to have bought should take a lot less than 4 days,
depending on what the ratio of average time spent per day on the
workstations is compared with full time on the Connection machine.

And if a 64,000 processor machine is one we know about, what do you suppose
they have that we don't know about?

Yeah, but this technique can also leave fingerprints, if naively 
implemented.

For instance, if I look at the color table entries and find that the
actual color values are duplicated, with identical colors sharing the
same index value except for the last bit, it's pretty clear that the
image contains an embedded message.

Or maybe the colors aren't exactly the same, but the autocorrelation
of the color table shows a huge spike at an offset which is a power
of two.  (e.g., you encode the data in the 3rd bit, and tweak the
color in a consistent manner.)

This means that your message could not only be found, but you may be
asked some rather embarrassing questions.  (Can you say "obstruction
of justice" if you lied about the existence of the data during the
execution of a legal search warrant?)

I don't wish to imply that data hiding techniques are impossible, but
don't fall into the "hidden compartment in the wallet" trap -- if the
program is well known, competent searchers will check your image files
for data encoded with that program.

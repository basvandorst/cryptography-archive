You may want to look at :

Fast Generation of Prime Numbers and Secure Public-Key Cryptographic Parameters
from Ueli M. Maurer

Part of this appeared in Eurocrypt '89 (Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Vol.
434, Springer Verlag Berlin, 1990, pp. 636-647.

Abstract:
A recursive algorithm for randomly selecting a provable prime with close to 
uniform distribution over the set of primes in a given interval is described.
Its expected running time is only about $1/3$ greater than the expected 
time required for generating a pseudo-prime that passes the Miller-Rabin 
test for only one base; it is therefore even faster than presently-used
algorithms for generating only pseudo-primes because several tests with 
independent bases need to be applied for achieving a sufficient level of 
confidence.

If you want me to, I can email you the above mentioned paper.

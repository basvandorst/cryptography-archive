  I have been reading this group for a while, and I have seen several
references to PGP encryption, but nothing on how to get the software.
I am under the impression that PGP software is freely available out
on the net somewhere (correct me if I'm wrong).  In any case, there was
an article in today's Wall Street Journal about PGP which mentioned
that at one time it was available, I presume via anonymous FTP.

  I should be most appreciative if someone could post (or better, e-mail
me directly) information about any FTP sites that have PGP source code
available.  I apologise if there is an obvious answer to this request
(perhaps mentioned in a sci.crypt FAQ?) but I have not been able to find
anything out about PGP otherwise.

  Thanks in advance.

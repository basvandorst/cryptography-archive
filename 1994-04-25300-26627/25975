Summary: I need some big numbers to test my D-H routines with
Keywords: Diffie-Hellman


I am working on some modular exponentiation routines which will be used
for a Diffie-Hellman key exchange, and am in need of some test vectors.

Does anyone out there have some solved modular exponentiation problems
they could mail me?  My routines work with 512 bit numbers (modulus, base,
exponent).

Something along the lines of: A = B^C mod D, where A, B, C, and D are
all 512 bit integers would be perfect.

My routines do succeed in doing a Diffie-Hellman exchange (i.e. both sides
generate the same session key), but it would sure be nice to test them
with some known numbers and see if they produce the correct answers.

Thanks in advance for your help.

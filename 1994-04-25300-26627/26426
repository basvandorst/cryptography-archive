      Compromise of the Skipjack algorithm wouldn't make it possible to
   read Skipjack-encrypted ciphertext, according to anyone who's seen the
   algorithm.  That's not why the algorithm is classified.

      Compromise of the algorithm would simply mean

   1.  That it was possible to build Clipper-compatible phones and such without
       key escrow.

To build Clipper-Compatible phones, it's probably necessary to steal
not only the SkipJack algorithm, but also the LEAF Creation Method
and the Family Key.  The documentation on the chip that I've read
isn't very clear on what happens if you hand a Clipper chip code
with a bad LEAF checksum; if it's willing to decode anyway,
then you can build compatibles with only SkipJack (which would
also help the foreign-model compatibility problem).

It's easy to design an family-key-type system with entirely published
algorithms, as long as you can keep the family key secret.
Keeping SkipJack secret means that, even if the family key gets stolen,
which is probably easier than stealing the algorithms, Clipper still works.
Example:
	DESCBC( SessionKey, DESCBC( FamilyKey, Data ) )

On the other hand, if you steal all three, you *can* break 
Clipper-encrypted SkipJack text if you can also get the user's chip keys,
e.g. by faxing in a request on judge stationary.
That doesn't let you break SkipJack cyphertext encrypted by people
who took better care of their keys than to feed them to Clipper,
though.

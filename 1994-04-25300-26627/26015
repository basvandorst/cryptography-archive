Not all mathematicians agree that a contradiction proves the truth.
Some believe that there is a third state: "I don't know."  For example,
does your social security number appear in the expansion of Pi?
True or False?  Reductio ad absurdum, or proof by excluding the middle,
was not considered valid by Brouwer (Constructivism) back in 1908.

Most mathematicians ignore Brouwer, however, and seem to get on pretty well.

True.

People who make this kind of mistake frequently make the semantic mistake of
believing that a scientific 'theory' is somehow insubstantial. Compare 
Scientific Creationism.

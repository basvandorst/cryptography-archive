Although I know nothing of the machine you mention I do dabble in
Viruses
(Virii ?) 
and this does not sound so good to me. Most virus programs I have seen
do not "jump around memory". They simply load a single copy once in
memory and (sometimes) infect other files on disk. Also I am not sure
what a special chip can do that software can't. Sounds like snake oil to
me. Besides, all machines are virus proof until people develop a virus
for them on purpose. Is there any reason to think someone can not just
learn what this wonder chip looks for and then program a virus to not
trigger it.?

Just my thoughts on this. Worth what you paid for them. :)

   To the contrary, it's a standard rhetorical technique called "reductio ad
   absurdum". The parallel is intended to show the absurdity of the pure logic
   behind the argument, by using the same logic with different circumstances.

That is not what reductio ad absurdum is at all.  Reductio ad absurdum
is a technique for proving a statement by demonstrating that assuming
its negation leads to a contradiction.  It relies on the fact that only
one of a statement and its negation can be true, so proving the negation
false demonstrates that the original statement is true.

As an example, suppose that I wish to prove that there is no greatest
prime number (i. e. that for any given prime number k, there is a number
k' that is greater that is prime, so that there are infinitely many
prime numbers).

To start, I assume that there is no prime number greater than k.  Thus,
there is a finite sequence of prime numbers: K = {2, 3, 5, 7,..., k}.

Now suppose I take the product P = 2 * 3 * 5 * ... * k.  This is clearly
divisible by all integers in K.

Consider the number P' = P + 1.  Dividing this number by any member of K
will leave a remainder of 1.  We have generated a number that cannot be
divided evenly by any number in K.  This implies that either P' is
divisible only by itself and 1 (in which case P' is prime), or P' is
divisible by two or more primes not in K.

However, our assumption was that there are no prime numbers not in K.
This assumption led to a contradiction, and hence is false.  Hence its
negation must be true.

THIS is an example of proof by reductio ad absurdum, and has nothing to
do with your example.

Your argument is an example of sweeping generalization.  As described in
the alt.atheism FAQ, in the section "Constructing a Logical Argument":

SWEEPING GENERALIZATION / DICTO SIMPLICITER

A sweeping generalization occurs when a general rule is applied to a
particular situation in which the features of that particular situation
render the rule inapplicable.  A sweeping generalization is the opposite of a
hasty generalization.

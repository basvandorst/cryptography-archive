Probably...

If he owns the computer, then he can legally put anything in the public 
domain on it or ban anything he wants.  Same for the computer that you 
own...

It would be my guess that the sysop does not want to encourage the use of 
encryption on his board, or on a network that he is part of.  Basically, 
some sysops (I've seen this for WWIVnet and FIDOnet) feel that they do 
not want anything on their system that might be illegal.  You can encrypt 
anything (plans to kill the president, pornography, NPD software..etc.) 
and put it anywhere without being detected.  Since the Sysop is 
responsible for everything on his board, legally speaking (if there is 
illegal software/child porn etc...), then he obviously feels that he is 
at risk by allowing or propagating PGP on his board...

 oops. That'll teach me not to rely on memory.

My point, though, was that the President has authority beyond carrying out
the will of Congress, as was suggested by another. For example:

(Article II Section 2) The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army
and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several states,
when called into the actual service of the United States.

In the case being discussed, it was asserted that one should not have to ask
Congress to intervene. But since the President is within his rights on
matters of national security as Commander in Chief, the only power Congress
has is to try to limit him via a back door, such as a denial of funds. This
takes a positive action by Congress.

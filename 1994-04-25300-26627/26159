(Jim Ebright) included the requirements for obtaining keys.  What,
specifically, would require more than the three corrupt officials I
mention?  ~principle prosecuting attorney of a subdivision of a state~
translates in my mind to a District Attorney, a docket number requires
a warrant, which quite a few judges can issue, and I imagine the cop would
only be necessary to show that someone appeared before the judge and asked
for the warrant.
 
I haven't seen anyone with another interpretation of these rules posting,
nor have I seen anyone with a less chilling interpretation of the explicit
statement that evidence obtained by a wiretap found to be illegal will
still be admissible in court.
 
Nor have I seen anyone with any specific ideas on how to keep criminals
from using secure encryption without making secure encryption illegal.
 
Kind of like "cut taxes, raise defense spending, balance the budget",
the stated goals and the means proposed just don't add up.

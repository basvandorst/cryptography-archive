Unfortunately, you are correct.

To the best of my knowledge, telephones by AT&T whose function is to
provide cryptographic level securtiy all use the Clipper/Capstone 
technology provided to them by the NSA via NIST.

Originally they were going to provide DES support, but were mugged by
ITARS and forced by the Big Brother and the Holding Company to use Clipper.
(Sorry Janis, no disrespect intended.)

There are some that provide security equipment on a military/heavy
commercial level.  They are not cheap.  The Swiss (Crypto AG) do a
lot of this.  There is a US company that does it too (and make STC-1's??)
I hope somebody will follow on with a more definitive listing.

It is not yet a big market and how it will grow is not yet defined.  That is
why "the men who don't admit where they work except to close friends and 
family unless pressed" :) are pushing the Clipper as the answer to 
business's comm security problems.  They hope, by being first with the 
most, to define what is considered privacy in the future.

Ahh, I see, a high school civics idealization model of reality ;)

No, I think that they think they work for the NSA.  They are the people
who can invoke National Security and who know more than they can tell.  
They are always in Washington...outliving most Administrators and 
Congressmen.  They work their own agenda.  

That is an I've read newspapers and books too much model of reality ;)

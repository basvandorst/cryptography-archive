This is a good example of why newsgroup discussions are so frustrating, and
go on interminably. My comment was designed to do only one thing--to refute
an obviously false statement. Rather than either accept the refutation or
show how the comment didn't refute the statement, it's used by the above
writer to start a wholly different point, but in a tone that implies my
comment, for the purpose it was posted, was refuted.

I'm not interested in this kind of non-discussion which seems to reflect
free association more than any kind of serious attempt to get at facts and
insight.

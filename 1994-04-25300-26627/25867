   Prohibiting the manufacture and export of nuclear weapons to Saddam means
   giving up some of our rights. The government has shown few or no cases where
   he's dropped an atom bomb on us. Shouldn't we wait until New York or
   Washington are lost beacause of a Saddam bomb before we give up rights?

The two cases are different, and must be judged on their individual
merits.  Your later use of the term "reductio ad absurdum" to this is --
absurd -- as you did not contradict hal@clark.net's position in any way.

Nuclear weapons have very different characteristics from crypto.
Nuclear weapons have the capability of directly killing people.  Nuclear
weapons require physical materials that can be interdicted.  Nuclear
weapons have no known civilian use.

Crypto is not capable of killing people directly.  Crypto consists
entirely of information (speech, if you must) that cannot be
interdicted.  Crypto has civilian use.

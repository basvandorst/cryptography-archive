Daniel, I thought (with your role in the ACM SIGSAC and all) that you
would know better than this.

Single user computer systems (most microcomputers, not just those
running MS-DOS) are particularly vulnerable to viruses, because of
the lack of privilege mechanisms between processes & files.  However
this is neither necessary nor sufficient for viruses to operate.
(For example see Fred Cohen's writings).

Who needs to attack the Operating System?  Viruses infiltrate poor
user procedures, eg having '.' in the front of a Unix path or "trying
out" external software on a production system rather than a seperate
test system.

Viruses are the Malware that menace PCs, but Worms are their counterparts
on multiuser or networked systems such as *nix.

Who/what integrity checks the integrity checkers?  Rely too much on 'md5'
and someone only needs to hack your integrity checker to record and
report the original "valid" sums and you are back to square one.

The attribution on this got messed up by the last poster (?), but I
<think> it's as follows: DS=David Sternlight, NH=Nat Howard, JC=Jeff Caruso
Apologies if I misattribute.

DS: Don't believe a lot of the assertions, distortions, and selective quoting
DS: you read here by partisans who in many cases have limited forensic skills.

NH: Does the original 4/16/93 announcement from the White House qualify?
NH:                 calls and data, under proper court or other legal
NH:                 order, when necessary to protect our citizens;
NH:...    A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a
NH:            court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.

JC: ...as plans move from concept briefing to implementation, the procedures
JC: get much more specific.
JC: What you're saying is "they weren't sure a year ago [that court orders
JC: would be required], the NIST document says they ARE sure now ...
JC: AHA! A CONTRADICTION!!"

No, this is untenable.  The most recent set of releases, specifically the
4 Feb 94 document called ees_nws1.txt in the NIST public ftp directory,
uses identical language:

A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a
     court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They
     would then present documentation, including a certification

As with the White House position that the President does

       not intend to prevent the private sector from developing, or the
       government from approving, other microcircuits or algorithms that
       are equally effective in assuring both privacy and a secure
       key-escrow system

which was reaffirmed by White House rep David Lytel at a conference
recently, they seem not to have changed their position here over the last
year.  No contradiction -- it just doesn't always require a court order...
other legal authorization is fine.  This may not be <just> the FISA court,
since NIST wasn't shy about referring to it specifically in other
documents released in the same package... they're being intentionally vague.

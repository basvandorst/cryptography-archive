That depends on the chaining mode.  In output feedback and cipher
feedback modes, you just leave off the extra bytes.  In cipher block
chaining, you can either pad with known patterns (the patterns
1, 22, 333, 4444, 55555, 666666, 7777777, 88888888 are popular)
and strip them off again on decryption.

The alternative is terminal block truncation, where you switch to
CFB for a block.  Take the last ciphertext block, encrypt it, and
XOR with as much plaintext as you have.  You can throw away the rest.

(If you don't know what a chaining mode is, *please* don't release your
software until you learn.  There is enough bad cryptographic software
out there already.)

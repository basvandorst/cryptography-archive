	Is there a good one way hash function which takes data and a salt S
such that H( H(D, S1), S2) = H( H(D, S2), S1)????  

	My 170 professor has challanged me to come up with a solution to the
Dining Cryptographers problem (with a large number of cryptographers) where
two cryptographers who try to get together can't find out much extra
information, and I THINK I might have a chance if I can find a one way hash
with the property above.

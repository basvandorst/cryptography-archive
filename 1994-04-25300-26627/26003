Yes! (Well almost.) In Britain, my company (Logica)had a hand in the Ernie
computer which generates very random numbers using special hardware. The
hardware was plugged into a DEC machine. What is Ernie used for? 

It generates numbers for the national lottery, a kind of Govt.
bond which also pays out ### if the Ernie computer selects
the bond number. ERNIE stands for something (some pom will 
know.) 

The random numbers are published so people know if they won.

Once I built one of those HiFi noise generator kits and wired it
up to the RS232 port. Sadly it was designed with three free-running
oscillators so wasn't truly random. (See Scientific Americ article
on fire-fly synchronisation, fasinating!).

BTW I have a question. Does anyone know an algorithm for
expanding pure random data with pseudo-random data? 

Suppose you have 10Mbytes of pure random data but you really need
20Mbytes. Is there areliable (un-crackable) way of padding out the
pure random stuff ? This would be a great way to send one-time pad key data
over the wire wouldn't it, by encrypting it with slightly less random 
data?

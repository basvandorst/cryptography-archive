Ummm... How about the Internet Virus of 1988, which brought
the internet to it's knees and panic'ed the defense department?

I can speak from personal experience that all of the unix machines
in the building where I worked were hit and knocked out.

Those who do not remember the past are doomed to ...
(somewhere on an MIT gopher you can find the definitive post-mortem
on the virus, written by Mark Eichen and Jon Rochlis, but don't
ask me where, because I don't know).

Now, at the risk of showing my own folly, let me suggest that
machines which use a Harvard-architecture (as opposed to a
Von Neuman architecture) really *are* virus proof.  

All major desktop computers today use the Von Neuman architecture,
where "program" memory and "data" memory live in the same space.
This allows for self-modifying code, which I think is a prerequisite
for virus propagation.

By contrast, the Harvard-architecture (which I think predates the
Von Neuman architecture) uses separate "program" and "memory"
spaces.  If those spaces are rigidly separated then programs
can not modify themselves or each other, preventing (I think)
the propagation of viruses.  Many common microcontrollers use
this type of architecture, with program memory in prom and
data memory in ram.

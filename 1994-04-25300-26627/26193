	That's because it has never seen a court room.  Now Dave can you tell
me why they have never filed a suit against Phil Zimmerman?  You know, the guy
who wrote PGP.  And that statement about the cease and desist letters, let's
see proof of the claim, how do we know that everyone ceased and desisted?
On a final note, you stay true to form, even the self contradictory statements
you make in your response.

OBTW the longer Phil Zimmerman is not sued by the patent holders, 
the harder it will be for them to uphold their claims in court.  Of
course there may be other reasons why they don't chance it.

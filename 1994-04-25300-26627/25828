Bullshit. I am ready to bet $1,000 that I'll be able to come up with
more than way to infect this computer.

Just curious, haven't they heard of non-resident viruses? Or do they
also stop the file managers from running?

WRONG. The above holds only for the known-virus scanners. There are
half a dozen other anti-virus protections which do not rely on looking
for scan strings of known viruses.

Viruses that jump from one place in memory to anohter?? Why on earth
would a virus want to do that? Most viruses just load in memory and
stay there.

My bet is that it doesn't. :-)

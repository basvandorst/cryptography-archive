The mind boggles. If Eric has done his math right, and I understand this
correctly, assuming a 100000 parallel processor machine each processor of
100 MIPS, a 1024 bit IPRA key would fall in 11 years, killing the
certification heirarchy. So would anyone's individual 1024 bit private key.
The Connection Machine we know about had 64,000 processors. 100 MIPS is not
at all beyond today's capabilities--we're getting near that range with the
PowerPC 604 100Mhz machines that will be made like popcorn for the mass
business market next year, and a company with the money of, say, a big oil
company or Japanese Zaibatsu/Keiretsu (or many governments) could easily
afford to make such machines if the prize is right.

Actually, at the current rate of increase of MIPS availability, long before
the 11 years have elapsed we'd have parallel processor machines faster than
100 MIPS per processor. What's more, if one is going to build a machine of
100000 parallel processors, one is likely going to automate both the chip
production and the assembly. A rich purchaser could thus build machines
with, say, a million processors, if the stakes were high enough and he had
the power of the government, and their intelligence budget behind him.

How much would such a machine cost? Maybe some of the engineers here more
conversant with the state of the art of both chip design and automated
production than I could answer. Recall that we're talking about the price to
the government, and thus the limits are budgetary, not market.

Unless I'm all wet, this cracking of RSA-129 is very bad news for those who
think current key lengths are safe for the foreseeable future, when it is
taken as a data point for extrapolating what a government or very wealthy
company might be able to do.

It certainly doesn't make arguments with respect to current key sizes that
wave the number of atoms in the universe in the air as palatable as they at
first seemed.

Note that in the above, I haven't assumed anything about the government
having at least somewhat better factoring algorithms, or some other
improvements which some here think only common sense for an organization
with the capabilities, money, dedication, and time of the NSA.

Someone please tell me I've got the quantitative consequences wrong.
Otherwise security is an illusion, and the best we can do is keep the bulk
of the not-so-vastly-rich out of our traffic. (Not that that's a bad
outcome--it's just not the high security outcome many here have been
trumpeting.) At a minimum, 1024 bit keys may not be nearly as strong as some
think, and we may have to got to bigger keys a lot sooner than some expect.
Let's hope widely available machines are cheap enough and fast enough that
the exponential increase to crack argument wins over the slower to encrypt
and decrypt argument.

Wouldn't it be droll if just as PKP's RSA patents expire, RSA becomes
relatively worthless, and they come up with some new and much stronger
trapdoor algorithm, giving them a new patent. Maybe they've already done so
and are keeping it a secret until RSA "falls" in the sense of this
discussion. That would allow Jim Bidzos to behave, as one of my favorite
Mark Twain aphorisms would have it, "with the calm confidence of a Christian
with four aces".

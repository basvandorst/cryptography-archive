Bullshit yourself!  The concept of rights is tied directly to the concept 
of justice.  They are not granted to you by any government.  Privleges 
can be given and taken away.  The only thing that can be done with rights 
as far as any govt is concerned is they can be respected or not.  When 
the rights of INDIVIDUALS are respected, we have justice, otherwise we 
don't.  I say INDIVIDUALS because groups don't have rights.  For rights 
to be worth anything, the can't be cummilative.  Otherwise, people would 
just pool theirs together and cancel yours out.  That happens a lot, but 
that's an injustice, not a truth.

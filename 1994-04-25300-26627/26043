    Clipper is useful. It will provide a service. That service will be 
    limited to:
       (1) A replacement for DES for government users.
       (2) A replacement for cleartext.
       (3) Other systems will not be prohibited.

Two-key Triple-DES can do the same thing; it's a stronger algorithm,
far better understood by the experts, and you can do it in software or
cheap hardware which makes it usable in far more situations than Clipper.
Furthermore, vendors can manufacture it and include it in their products
without getting the NSA's permission, so they're more likely to do so.

It's especially useful for applications like email - the people who
pretend other systems won't be prohibited are also pretending that
Clipper is only for voice, so let's hold them to it.

As a system for government users, the STU-III phones were supposed to
be a standard that they'd buy half a million of, for use inside govt
and by govt contractors and local police agencies.  As a replacement
for DES, it includes an earlier NSA-special chip, but doesn't have
built-in wiretapping.  The price of STU-IIIs is about twice the price
of the AT&T clipperphone, which is still as affordable as a high-end PC,
but they didn't go buying millions of them.

Furthermore, if *you* were a government agent buying a secure phone,
would you want one that the NSA and GAO could wiretap any time they
suspected you were shipping arms to Iran or cocaine from Nicaragua?  Not.

As a cleartext-replacement, even single-DES will work as well as
Clipper to prevent casual eavesdroppers.

If you think other systems won't be prohibited, aren't you forgetting
that they're import-and-export prohibited now, except by special permission?
Just *try* getting that slick new DES-fax from Bulgaria or Taiwan,
or getting your local cellphone company to start using A5-encrypted
equipment from Europe to sell more expensive service to the financial market.

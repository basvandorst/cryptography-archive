In article <strnlghtCnzJ79.74G@netcom.com>, strnlght@netcom.com (David Sternlight) says:

Would one of those rights be the right to have nuclear bombs?
...or would it be the the right not to distribute nuclear bombs?
...or, maybe, the right to live without the fear of nuclear boms?
Probably the last one!

As far as nuclear boms are concerned, there are no rights that support their 
existence.  They are an instrument of fear.  
Nuclear bombs are made to kill, privacy is not.

In some ways, this is even worse than giving the police ready access
to the actual contents of the conversations. That's because, all
assurances about "innocent until proven guilty" to the contrary, in
this country people are frequently convicted, or more often browbeaten
into pleading guilty, to crimes they did not commit by mere
circumstantial evidence.

Evidence like "telephone records show person A talked for 10 minutes
with person B right before B admits he committed the crime, therefore
A must also have been involved, and even worse they're both guilty of
conspiracy". (Read the Tanya Harding story, for one particular
example.  Guilty or not, justice demands *far* better evidence than
that.)

Presenting records that merely show that A talked to B can easily
create a strong inference of conspiracy that A and B would find very
hard to rebut unless they happen to have made tapes of their calls and
produce in court to show that the calls were innocent. Since rather
few ordinary folks do this, this gets just a little too close to
"guilty until proven innocent" for my taste.

So in some ways, the proposals to open up transaction records to the
police without warrants is even more insidious than rubber-stamped
wiretap warrants or even key escrow. Insidious because the average
person just doesn't realize how much can be gleaned from what the
spooks call "traffic analysis". And it's because of that lack of
appreciation that even people who are otherwise highly concerned about
protecting the content of a conversation tend to shrug when this topic
comes up.

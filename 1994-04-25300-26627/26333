I need to implement an IRC like system for conferencing. However I also need
to implement security on the system. I have chosen to use PGP for the code
but I am concerned about IDEA strength under the operating conditions I will
be exposing it to. The system will require many 500 byte or so messages to
be encrypted. Further each message can be guaranteed to contain at least one
word for which there are at most 20 or so possible values (i.e. the name tag
of the person sending the message). Knowledge of the subject of the
conference (which must be assumed to be available) should allow for a good
selection of jargon words to be used in a plain text attack. How well will
IDEA function under these conditions?

		Thank you for your time,

p.s. I am not trying to use 'common sense' here because I have had a number
of math friends over the years show me situations where 'common sense'
destroyed the security of a system.

Would someone please tell me why this system loves eating my
signature files?

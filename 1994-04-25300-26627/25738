	you guessed it. if you want the source, write me. i didn't 
include it because a) the program is trivial b) the program is large and 
c) the source uses a commercial toolbox, so wouldn't be comileable anyway.

the scattering is not that comples...its just a safet feature to defend 
against very simple analysis. i don't do any actual encryption of the 
data to be hidden. i'm not a cryptographer. my program does use IDEA to 
encrypt the HEADER data (file length, prng "seed", and version number) 
with the simplified key---8-or-less ascii characters. not terribly safe, 
but it doesn't have to be terribly safe. you can hide encrypted data.

my program would happily extract data from any gif file, except that if it 
reads the wrong version number it won't. without the key, it won't read 
the right version number. wityhout data in the GIF, it will only VERY 
rarely read the correct version number, and then it would pull out any 
old garbage. of course, this could technically happen anyway. so what's 
the problem? you can't tell if there's a)keyed data or b)garbage

because the easiest way to modify the gif file is to use the video memory 
to modify individual pixels.

like i said, the program is trivial....write one you like if you don't 
like mine. =r)

I think the only thing you can do in Windoze is to check the check the
"Exclusive" box, and uncheck the "Background" box to prevent the task from
being swapped.  Unfortunately, this also disables the main reason for
running Windows in the first place.  As I recall from reading the PGP source
code, PGP overwrites all sensitive values with zeroes as soon as they're no
longer needed to minimize the length of time that they reside in memory.

Nevertheless, a PGP user should think twice before encrypting anything on a
milti-user or milti-tasking computer where he/she doesn't wish the owner
and/or sysadmin to be able to read.  There are sysadmin tools that will echo
an entire session to sysadmin, including individual keystrokes, so beware.

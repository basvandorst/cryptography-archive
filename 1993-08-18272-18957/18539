   Check out Eurocrypt 90, "A known-plaintext attack on two-key triple
encryption," by van Oorschot and Wiener.  They show that triple DES isn't
quite as strong as it "should" be, though their attack isn't practical.
They refer to a chosen-plaintext attack on triple encryption by Merkle
and Hellman, requiring 2**56 chosen plaintexts and 2**56 operations.
They then develop an attack requiring 2**(120 - lg(n)) operations and
n words of memory, where n = the number of known-plaintext/ciphertext
pairs available.  (Ie, with 2**32 known plaintexts, the attack would
require about 2**78 operations.)
 
   The authors suggest that this may show a "certificational weakness" to
triple-DES, ie an attack which isn't practical, but which may show weaknesses
that *could* be used in a practical attack.

A recent EFF newsletter raised an interesting point, which I hadn't
picked up on until now: the only decent reason to maintain secrecy
of the algorithm (assuming it has no trapdoor) is to leave the door
open for a future ban on other techniques.  It is unnecessary to the
security of MYK-encrypted communications.  The "foreigners might get
their claws on good crypto technology" argument is moot.  But
release of the algorithm would allow cryptographically-strong use of
Skipjack.  Mr. Sternlight, would you count this as evidence that the
government is keeping its options open?

And, of course, we have:

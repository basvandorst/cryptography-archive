   Which, of course, makes the Big Brother Access Field insecure, by axiom.

It's not mainly to prevent faking the Big Brother Access Field;
SkipJack is presumably good enough that you can prevent this as long
as you keep the FBI Key secure* and also secure any keys used in the
secret Escrow Authenticator (EA) checksums. 
The main paranoia has been about letting you skip the Big Brother field
entirely, and simply flood the market with better-than-DES SkipJack phones.

On the other hand, the Proposed FIPS for Escrowed Encryption Standard (EES)
that Dave Banisar posted the NIST request-for-comments about here
mentions that not only is the SkipJack algorithm classified,
but the "LEAF Creation Method 1" is also classified, making the
so-called standard even more impossible to follow/implement/verify,
aside from its other underspecification and political problems.
Keeping this classified is clearly to prevent faking the Wiretap Field.

*Yes, I realize the FBI Family Key will probably be available, for a bribe;
the EA part may be secure crypto with a key, which is probably easier
to protect than the Fibbie Key, or it may be a non-crypto checksum
which is kept Obscure and therefore maybe bribeable if unclassified.

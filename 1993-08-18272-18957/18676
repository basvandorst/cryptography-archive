I would like to suggest an extention of this third possibility that I haven't
seen mentioned so far.  Please forgive me if it has been discussed before.

It seems to me that currently even if the NSA can break a code (DES, for
example) that is being used by a common criminal, it isn't going to be
useful for law enforcement.  Certainly, the NSA is not going to demonstrate
the ability to break any of the standard codes in court just to prosecute
a drug dealer.  On the otherhand, with key escrow there will be no need
to show such an ability.  In fact, there will be no reason for the NSA
to become publically involved at all.  The only difference a "back door" in
the Skipjack algorithm would make is that the NSA (and law enforcement 
agencies, if the NSA is friendly) would get to preview the plain text
and find out whether it is worth getting a court-order.  In my opinion,
the purpose of key escrow is the enforcement of laws against victimless
crimes.  Whether this is a noble purpose or the prelude to the death
of freedom is, of course, a political question.

This is my first post to this group -- please try not to be too harsh.

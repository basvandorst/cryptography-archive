What's relevant is that you failed to comment during the discussion

No. Ever since the Great Renaming we have had a _hierarchy_ of groups.
The similarity of themes is reflected by the _leading_ components. 
_Final_ components are chosen for many other reasons, such as length and
comprehensibility.

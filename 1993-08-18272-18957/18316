   I can see two other problems with their copyright.
   First, there's no proof that no other computer or other device has ever
produced that bit stream, much less produced that bit stream on a regular
basis.  If that bit stream has been (or very well could have been) produced
before by other equipment or persons, and statistically it's likely it has
been produced at some time during the history of computers, then Nintendo
cannot prove they were the original authors and can't copyright it.
   Second, they apparently never published the bit stream itself as a
unique work; it was an inclusion in other works and therefore not
separately copyrightable.  Put another way, if I put the sentence "The
quick brown fox jumps over the lazy nerts" into everything I write, I
can copyright the individual works but not the sentence.  Had they
published the bit stream as a unique work, it might have held up; but then
they couldn't control the stream of counterfeit and/or unauthorized video
games that would stream from places with weak copyright enforcement, like
Hong Kong (thus my idea that they apparently never published it separately).

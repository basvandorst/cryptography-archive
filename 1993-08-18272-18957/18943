Based on my personal experiences with them, I can only say that
my impression of the NSA is that they have, by far, the highest
level of morale, esprit de corps, and patriotism of any organization
I have ever seen. They make the US Marine Corps look dispirited.

How they do this under US government service rules is beyond
me. They can't offer much pay, and cannot fire people for mere 
incompetency without a years-long, generally unsuccessful process.
Maybe they keep a guillotine in the back room. 

Within an orgainzation like the NSA, peer-group esteem is a reward
for which people will gladly die. An NSA mathemetician would feel
at least as rewarded by becoming part of the Agency's lore as by
receiving a Nobel. The Offical Secrets Act has no relevance, as it
is a British law. Under US law, disclosure of secrets to the public
at large (as opposed to a foreign entity) is very hard to punish--
e.g. Ellsberg and Agee. US secrets are guarded by the loyalty of
the secret-holders, not by any effective means of coercion.

FWIW, they consider The_Puzzle_Palace to be a laughably inaccurate
picture of the Agency.

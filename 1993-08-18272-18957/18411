I believe that GOST is the Russian analogue of DES.  It's certainly not
unlikely that the package does what they claim; I chatted to someone
in the Soviet Union using PGP, in the days when there still was a Soviet
Union.  Just as well the US has ITAR regulations, eh?  Suffice it to say
the Russians certainly have RSA, DES, and IDEA, as well as their own
encryption algorithms.

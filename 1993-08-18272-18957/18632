Based on her statements in sci.crypt and elsewhere before the evaluation
committee got started, she's not just evaluating arguments on both
sides.  She's trying to sell the idea of key escrow to the public,
and I don't expect someone doing that to bring up disadvantages of what 
they're advocating.  (I don't expect Clinton to say bad things about 
his budget in public, either, nor do I expect the head of "Mothers
Against Drunk Driving" to say anything good about alcohol or liberalizing
the rules on the sale of it.)  She brought up the subject of key escrow 
on sci.crypt (when was it?  October 1992?  In any case, this was well 
before Clipper or Skipjack was announced).  She's brought it up in other
forums as well.

It wouldn't surprise me at all that the NSA would "stack the deck"
by choosing evaluation committee members who are favorable to the idea
of key escrow.  It's even better if they can choose members who have 
gone out of their way to advocate key escrow.  Disinformation is part of
their job.  It's also done all the time in other political group 
decisions such as Congressional committees.  The result you get
is a political decision, not an objective evaluation.

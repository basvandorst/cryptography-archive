    This is a very bad idea.  Any rule such as this, which
substantially limits the search space, makes the system using the rule
easier to crack.  If you want to avoid dictionary attacks and reuse of
passwords, put in a passwd function which checks against a dictionary
and against previously used passwords on the system.  It only takes a
few seconds to check a new password against a list of thousands of
"remembered" encrypted (expired only, please, for other users)
passwords.

Hello,

  What would be the "best" license control (not copy-protection) scheme?
  I guess that a scheme based on embedding a public key and decoding
  algorithm with the software, the vendor generating a "voucher" with
  his private key given the serial number of the machine, and the program
  veryfing that the encoded and decoded versions match is the way a lot of
  companies go. But that leaves the problem of the program being prone to
  craking by directly bypassing the protection scheme. Should this then be augmented
  by some kind of encryption of the binaries themselves? The decoding key for that
  (the same for all users) could be hidden somehow in the voucher communicated to
  the user, which means we are dealing with a third-level of encryption now.
  
  Anything safer and easier?

Hello everyone,

Is there anyone out there that has implemented a system using smart cards
for both physical access and logical access?

If so, what are the brands that are good.
What are the features that make one brand better than another (ie: why did
you choose a brand to implement rather than another)

Is there any cryptographic smart cards available, or is there any
cryptographical readers as well?

Thanks.

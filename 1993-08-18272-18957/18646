This is frequently said, but I haven't seen it done. For example, at Plessey 
Crypto in Liverpool, both the military and banking divisions were on the same 
site, and when I turned up to buy some RSA hardware I got hospitality from both 
their military and civilian people.

GCHQ will have Crown Immunity, but their suppliers won't. In any case, I
understand that in the UK, algorithm design is done by suppliers rather than by 
the government (though under NATO rules, it all gets vetted by the NSA).

So if lawyers from the Federation Against Software Theft can raid Marconi 
Defence Systems and cart off PCs with Top Secret information on the design of 
missile guidance systems, air defence radar and spy satellites, then NSA 
certified military crypto designs are just as vulnerable.

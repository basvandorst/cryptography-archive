The problem with the copyright of the bitstream might simply have been
that it did not express sufficient originality to warrant copyright
protection.   For example, a string like,
   'J60fnNPgWonFKCpzRH4fG31BjeuvBGyNHO7quIKn3lt1GSmacVSf' 
might be considered by the court not represent a sufficient
originality of thought to warrant such protection (this particular
string is a portion of my PGP-key, but you see the idea for any string
which doesn't look like natural language).  I think, the string might
well have held up better in court if it had been something itself
"publishable" -- perhaps the text of Hal's above post, for example, or
maybe a Haiku composed by Nintendo's owner.

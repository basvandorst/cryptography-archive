There is a third possible reason.  While SKIPJACK might be strong enough
to protect classified information, policy might dictate not using an
algorithm that would be as widely available as Clipper.  You might use
an algorithm that is just as strong as SKIPJACK, but that was not made
available for civilian use.  That way, if the bad guys did happen to 
break SKIPJACK, they would not get the classified information without
having to also break something else.

Remember that if you have key escrowing, there is little need for 
additional back doors or weaknesses.  Indeed, if such a back door
or weakening were ever discovered, the public outcry would surely doom any
future attempt to use key escrowing.

Disclaimer:  This comment is based on pure speculation on my part.
I have no particular insite into either the goodness or badness of
SKIPJACK nor any insite into NSA doctrine for choice of crypto systems
to protect classified information. It is also not a defense of the notion
of key escrowing.

I've seen mention of a WordPerfect password cracking program several
times.  In fact, I even vaguely remember reading a description of the
exact encryption method (XOR'ing w/ repeated password string -- Wow!),
known plaintext, and such involved in breaking a WP password.  But I
don't remember where to get the actual program to do this, nor exactly
what it was called.  Could someone please direct me appropriately?

Just in case anyone cares, the files I want to "break" are a bunch of
Supreme Court opinions made electronically available through a thing
called "The Hermes Project", centered at Case Western Law School.
What's remarkably stupid about the thing is that some of the WP
versions of the files have passwords on them, even though the exact
same texts are available in plain ASCII, TEX, and some other formats
without any passwords.  I suppose I could either download a different
version of the files I want, or try to contact the administrator of
the service -- but I think it would be easier just to ftp the cracking
program. 

Yours, Lulu...

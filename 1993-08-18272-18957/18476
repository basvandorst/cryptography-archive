   |PART 121-THE UNITED STATES MUNITIONS LIST
   |  Enumeration of Articles
   |  Sec.
   |  121.1 General. The United States Munitions List.
   Under section 121.1 they have a ton of exceptions:
   |  Category XIII-Auxiliary Military Equipment
   |   (b) Information Security Systems and equipment, cryptographic devices,
   |software, and components specifically designed or modified therefor, including:

   |   (1) Cryptographic (including key management) systems, equipment, assemblies,
   |modules, integrated circuits, components or software with the capability of
   |maintaining secrecy or confidentiality of information or information systems,
   >|except< cryptographic equipment and software as follows:  ...
   |   (ix) Software designed or modified to protect against malicious computer
   |damage, (e.g., viruses).
   [YOU BET!  No sir, I didn't want the CIA damaging my computer, that's why I'm using
	   triple DES with IDEA to protect these files]
:-) That was about my reaction too...

   There is a section about "public domain" too.  Here is their definition: 
   |   120.11 -- Public domain.
   |   Public domain means information which is published and which is generally
   |accessible or available to the public:
   |   (1) Through sales at newsstands and bookstores;
   |   (4) At libraries open to the public or from which the public can obtain
   |documents;
To avoid confusion about whether an FTP site is a library, you can
always donate copies or crypto material to your local government-run library
   |   (5) Through patents available at any patent office;
Does this mean RSA is public-domain-for-ITAR-purposes?

   |   (6) Through unlimited distribution at a conference, meeting, seminar, trade
   |show or exhibition, generally accessible to the public, in the United States;
I didn't have any copies of PGP at last weekend's Anarchist Convention,
but maybe we can bring some to the next similar event?

   |   (8) Through fundamental research in science and engineering at accredited
   |institutions of higher learning in the U.S. where the resulting information is
   |ordinarily published and shared broadly in the scientific community. Fundamental
   |research is defined to mean basic and applied research in science and
   |engineering where the resulting information is ordinarily published and shared
   |broadly within the scientific community, as distinguished from research the
   |results of which are restricted for proprietary reasons or specific U.S.
   |Government access and dissemination controls. University research will not be
   |considered fundamental research if:
   |   (i) The University or its researchers accept other restrictions on
   |publication of scientific and technical information resulting from the project
   |or activity, or
   |   (ii) The research is funded by the U.S. Government and specific access and
   |dissemination controls protecting information resulting from the research are
   |applicable.

Does this mean we could hire a researcher, maybe Peter Honeyman, for $1 plus expenses,
not place any restrictions on publication for him or the University to accept,
to share information we provide with the science and engineering community,
for non-commercial non-proprietary use, and make something public domain that way?

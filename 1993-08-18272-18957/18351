The KY-28 was a "black box" used for air-air and air-to ground Comsec
during the Vietnam War.  I doubt if they are still in use, and doubt if
you could get a schematic or system specification.  
  
The following portions in quotes are from James Bamford, The Puzzle
Palace, New York, Houghton Mifflin,  1982, p. 130, the rest from a paper
TBP.
During the Vietnam war, fighter pilots complained the KY-28 voice
encryptor took "too long to synchronize". It was "at least a nuisance and
at worst a hazard." As a result, the equipment was often switched off and
transmissions were made in the clear.  

I understand "too long" was "a few seconds".   In a tacticle situation
(like someone shooting at you), you may not want to hold down the mike
button in lieu of 100% focus on manuvering/other appropriate action....
 Another source told me the results were often disastrous, as the North
Vietnamiese were listening and had a reasonable alert system.  I heard
(in 1985)  there was a warehouse full of them, "somewhere".  I doubt if
they are still in use, or that you could get a schematic or system
specification.  

Don't know about the Physical Security, and doubt that you will find any
at army surplus "intact".

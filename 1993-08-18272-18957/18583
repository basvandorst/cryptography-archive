   pdc@dcs.ed.ac.uk (Paul Crowley) asks why feedback causes short loops.

   A 64-bit block cipher E(M,K) maps 64-bit values to other 64-bit values.
   Hopefully it maps input to output 1 to 1 with no correlation, i.e., for
   all values of input 0..2**64-1 you will get as output all values
   0..2**64-1 in a scrambled order.

   Let's model this concept with a "perfect" 64-bit block cipher built by
   creating a lookup table of 2**64 elements. Initialize each element with
   its ordinal value. Shuffle each element with another element chosen at
   random using a hardware RNJ based on quantum events. You now have a
   lookup table with 1 to 1 mapping and no correlation. Look up element 0.
   element 0 points to element n. Element n points to another element and
   so on. But the odds are extremely slim that all the elements are chained
   together in one long loop. In reality there are probably many smaller
   loops, e.g. a-->b-->c-->a.

The expected size of a loop is of order sqrt(n).  This observation
(short loops in a random mapping) is used in Pollard's rho method of
integer factorization --- a prime factor p is found in order sqrt(p)
iterations.  The "random" mapping most often used is of the form x_i+1 =
(x_i)^2 + c for small c.  Sometimes (look up why for yourselves) a
higher power than the square is used.

For many years, I've wondered whether it would be worth trying a DES
chip as the random mapper in the rho algorithm.  I'm virtually certain
it is no better, and probably slightly worse, than the standard one but
it might be fun to try.

I have heard this meme too many times from different NIST people...
why is a system like triple DES weaker than Skipjack?  RSA can be
expanded to any keylength (although it becomes computationally 
unfeasable at some point).

Skipjack is _not_ the strongest cryptosystem ever developed, and
clearly there are publically published cryptosystems with longer
keyspaces.  But I keep hearing "we must keep Skipjack concealed
to keep the 'bad guys' from getting this awesome cryptosystem
so they will have to use 'weaker systems'."

Skipjack is a proprietary standard, like micro-channel, aimed more
at keeping other people from interfacing with it (witout key
escrow) than being an amazingly secure system.  It does have a
reasonable keyspace, but it isn't the biggest.

I am preparing a Public Comment on the Clipper/Skipjack proposal for the 
Society for Electronic Access, and I want to make sure I understand 
the relationship between the chip and the LEAF.

As I read the proposal, the Key Fields unique to each clipper chip are 
PROM which are set by the manufacturer, not the user. First of all, is 
that correct? Second, does that mean that once a Law Enforcement agency
gets the escrowed keys, that chip is forever readable to that agency,
even without subsequent warrants, and that the user must effectively buy 
a new chip (or a new phone) if they want to return to secure communications?

Also, about a month ago I believe I saw the result of an FOIA request which
had turned up a memo on encryption to the Sec'y of Defense. As this group has
no archive and my host has purged the news recently, if anyone has this doc, 
could you mail it to me or tell me where to get it?

Thanks in advance,

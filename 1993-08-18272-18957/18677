Actually, not to change the subject but, I would think the budget would
go up, not down, now that the cold war is over. The world is a much more
dangerous place without the Soviet Union keeping their "satellites" in
check. Nuclear proliferation is a reality, not just a fear, and their
are many more countries that the government has to keep tabs on. 

Yes, I'm sure that there is an amount of "spying" being done on US
citizens, but I think it is a little paranoid to believe that the
government is that interested in the personal communications of the
average citizen.

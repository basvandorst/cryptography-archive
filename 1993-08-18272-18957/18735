Can anyone provide a reference that discusses steaganography (sp?), preferably
from a modern perspective?  I recall seeing the subject discussed here briefly
when someone mentioned the possibility of storing information in the LSBs of
image files.  It would also be nice to be able to imbed hidden, and possibly
encrypted information in more ordinary messages, such as ascii text.

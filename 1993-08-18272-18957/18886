	The important hypothesis is that at least one prime factor
of n (say p) is congruent to 1 mod 3.  By Fermat's little
theorem, the polynomial x^(p-1) - 1 splits into linear factors
mod p, so x^3 - 1 (a divisor of x^(p-1) - 1) splits into three
linear factors.  In other words, a primitive cube root of 1 exists (mod p).

	Assume n is not a prime power (a case easily disposed of).
Otherwise select a random nonzero integer a with 0 < a < n.
Check that gcd(a, n) = 1; if not, you have factored n.
Compute a^3 mod n, and feed this to the cube root algorithm,
which returns b such that b^3 == a^3 (mod n).
	
	There are (at least) three different cube roots of a^3 mod n.
The quotient b/a will be a random cube root of 1 mod n.  If q is
another prime factor of n, then the congruences

		b/a == 1 mod q		(probability >= 1/3)
		b/a !== 1 mod p		(probability 2/3)

will be simultaneously true at least 2/9 of the time.
By computing gcd(b/a - 1. n), you find a factor of n.

	If all prime factors of n are == 2 (mod 3),
then the problem is much harder.  Assuming n is squarefree,
the function x -> x^3 (mod n) is a bijection.  We can ask the
cube root algorithm to find cbrt(2), cbrt(3), cbrt(5), ... mod n,
but it not known whether these are useful in factoring n.

And which particular caveat was on the glasses of beer you were offered by 
each?

Wouldn't one have to know, pretty exactly, what 'their suppliers' actually do
and to understand the security restrictions upon that work pretty well before
issuing such a broad statement?

Again, that's quite a bite you take. Would you care to specify?

I'd be more than interested if you can let me have details. A PC storing TS
material sounds pretty much a contradiction in terms :-) And as for spy satellites.....Oh my!

*If* representatives of FAST managed to run off with TS etc. without getting 
shot, they were straight in line for arrest, trial and sentence to a looong
stretch. Improper possession and *no* defence. As for those who you say gave
the stuff away to persons not authorised to receive it...... 

Perhaps the material was something other than TS do you think? That's how I 
remember it anyway. But no doubt it suited the FAST Ghostbuster PR dept to make the notch on their pistol grip look as impressive as possible. 

If not, and since it has already been blatantly compromised without remedial
action, why not publish a copy here and prove your point?

In article <CBu8A2.nw1@ns1.nodak.edu>, jorgense@plains.NoDak.edu 
(Lee A. Jorgensen) asked:

The DES box has a printer attached to it which prints the PINs directly on to 
secure mailers. This is also used to print components for terminal master keys
and for zone keys (the keys which banks share with each other or with a regional
switching centre).

This is not infallible; indeed the leading brand of DES box has only one serial 
port, so you have to switch manually between the terminal and a printer. The 
obvious attack would be for an operator to define an extra ATM and copy the key 
components from the terminal screen. I have no record of anybody actually 
stealing money this way but it's still a rather sloppy design,

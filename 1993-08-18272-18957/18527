       That's very good news.

       I get the feeling that the administration is distancing itself from
the Clipper proposal.  The most likely outcome at this point is that the
chip will be used only for Government applications.  AT&T may make a
Clipper-compatible phone, but it will be actively marketed only to Government
customers.  If the Clipper phone comes out priced above $500, that's a
good indication that it is going nowhere commercially.

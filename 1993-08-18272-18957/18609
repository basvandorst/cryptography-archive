Thanks to those who have / are replying,  (Keep those cards and letters
and electrons coming).  I have several cross-checked historical
references.  Most of the references from the  40's/50's/60's (Written
about in the 60's, 70's and early 80's) are to breaking  Crypto AG /
Crypto Hagelin equipment. 

I would like go get some more contemporary examples.  

Here are a few I have hard sources on: (Names obscured to protect the
guilty)

1) "The National Key Concept:"   A certain country <in S. America on a
famous line> allegedly is still using the same key for all Comsec traffic
every year.  They create a vector long enough for their longest device
and then used a subset for other devices.  Simple, Easy and  ******. 

2) Default Key Usage:  Several examples where equipment has been returned
to the manufacture for service and the default or test key was still in
the unit (and no, the user wasn't smart enough to change it when he got
the equipment or before he sent it back in.)

3)  One about an Antarctic Researcher who (apparently ***very bored*** )
listened  and trained his ear to a <x-505> Analog Comsec Unit *for years*
and could understand about 1/4 of what was said by <country deleted>
personnel using the equipment.

4) A <x-x00> secure message terminal that always used the same key on
"real traffic" after running a self test.  (It left the KG in a specific
position and didn't re-randomize after the self test)

5) A user makes a secure call, finds out the far end doesn't have the
same key, so he gets his key and reads it to the far end user before
going secure.  (I know he still has privacy, but kinda of blew any real
security)

Thanks in advance for any help.  I'll publish what I can substantiate, as
well as what I can't.

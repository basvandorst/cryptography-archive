	One of the arguments I've often heard is that non-clipper
hardware is likely to be more expensive, harder to get, or nonstandard.
Has anyone got any accurate pricing information on clipper-based
phones yet?? I've got some fact sheets on the Cylink phone encryptor,
which is $1900 (less in quantity) and uses DES w/ D-H key exchange.
If the AT&T 3600 encryptor was $1200 without clipper (the DES based
prototype) the final prices are going to have to get close.

	I'm interested in collecting information about any other
alternative secure phones (non-STU phones, that is) that may be out
there. Anyone know of any other than the Cylink units?

[ General info on the Cylink products, they have 2 of interest, the
$1900 SecurePHONE, which works with a standard touch or rotary phone,
supports clear and secure modes, uses DES CFB or Cylink's own algorithm,
uses Diffie Hellman based key exchange, supports V.32 standard modem
interface with an RJ11 jack. Size 9"x10"X2", wt 4lbs, aluminum case.
Their other product is a LS-20 low speed data encryptor, which is basically
the SecurePHONE without the phone support, providing a 19.2K RS-232
interface.]

  David, -do- work on your reading comprehension.  I referred to Dr.
Denning's -reputation-, which is an objective fact (as established,
for example, by the responses to her views found here on sci.crypt).
-My- opinion was nowhere mentioned, and is irrelevant, since I am but
one voice in a great chorus, with infinitesimal effect on any reputation
or any other consensus.

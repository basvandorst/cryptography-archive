Reality check: The ``major mistake'' Sean refers to is my choice of
``talk.politics.crypto'' instead of ``talk.politics.crypt''. Does such
an incredibly trivial ``mistake''---if it is a mistake at all---really
justify delaying the creation of talk.politics.crypto for six months?

There is quite a bit of inappropriate traffic in sci.crypt. Most of it
will be drawn out by talk.politics.crypto. After this we can think about
also creating sci.crypt.research. These new groups will make sci.crypt a
much more pleasant place. Sean Ryan wants to delay these groups by half
a year just because he doesn't like a trailing ``o''.

If Sean truly supported talk.politics.crypt/crypto, he would have 
brought up his concerns during the discussion period. Now it's too late.
Either we get talk.politics.crypto or we don't get any group until 1994.

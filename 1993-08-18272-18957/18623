This is not my field, but as a consumer, most of a ATM and credit
cards let me pick my own PIN number, which suggests that it is not
related to my account number, which does not change.

In fact, the usual response when someone calls in to say that they
have forgotten their PIN is to send out a form to pick a new one.

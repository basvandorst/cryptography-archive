You say that the terrorists could be using triple DES with RSA key managment.
This is, of course, true, they COULD be using such a system.  The question is
"What are they using?"  Are terrorists spending their time or money on custom
crypto systems or car bombs?  I suspect (but have no way to verify it)
that terrorists would use commercial crypto systems and spend their time and
money on custom car bombs.  If this suspection hold true, the Clipper LEAF will
help the law enforcement community in their anti-terror mission.

The social issue needs considerable debate.  How much privacy should the
citizens give up to allow the law enforcement community to perform their
anti-terror mission.  Or, any other law enforcement mission...

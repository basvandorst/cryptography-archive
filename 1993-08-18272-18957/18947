How about a real-life problem for today?

One of the former Eastern Block countries, I think
I heard Estonia or Latvia, has a large number of
Russian nuclear-tipped missiles within their borders.
They are now trying to break the launch-codes, we
can assume to gain a bargaining chip with somebody.
The Russian government has advised Clinton of the
potential need to make a preventive strike against
them. Any bets on the outcome of this one?

[sigh] No, it's not solved.

Cryptography gives you _continuity_. You can make sure that the entity 
you were talking to yesterday is the same one you're talking to today.
What cryptography doesn't give you is the slightest bit of knowledge of 
_who or what that entity really is_.

_If_ your prior knowledge of a Kerberos server is correct, then the 
Kerberos protocols will give you confidence that you're talking to the 
same server now. But how do you know it was correct in the first place? 
Suppose you've been communicating all this time with a rogue server? You 
would never know.

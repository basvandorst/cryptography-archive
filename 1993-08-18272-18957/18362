	BINGO!

	In arenas such as cryptography and any other where power may in
	any form be had, this is the case.  Control is more the name of
	the game than anything else and those in power want all the
	advantage.  It is a matter of principle taken to the neurotic
	and perhaps psychotic extreme.  *If* it *can* be controlled,
	the *they* (whatever bureaucratic element that may have an interest)
	must be the ones doing the controlling.  This would be particularly
	true for the ability to keep a secret from the guvermint, which
	in principle is something that is intolerable for them since it
	diminishes their dominion over the rest of us.

	To classify RSA and other encryption software as "munitions" is
	idiotic beyond all measure, but the fact that this is so reveals
	much about the way "they" think and operate.  The laws may be stupid,
	largely ignorable, and unconstitutional, but don't do anything
	too blatantly inflamatory lest you find yourself in trouble that would
	at best cost you more in legal fees than you could pay for in an entire
	lifetime.

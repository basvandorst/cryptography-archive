This is probably just realism - a single key shared by every single 
Visa/Mastercard/Amex/etc. card verifier is no longer really a secret,
so why use it?

And who would want to administer tens of millions of secret keys (assuming
1 key change/year, that would be >300,000 key changes per day!)

[Also don't forget that the code numbers and phone numbers for manual
verification are generally posted next to most cashier's terminals.]

Presumably direct debit card transactions use a more secure protocol.

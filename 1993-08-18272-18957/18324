If you ask them, they will claim that you are violating the ITAR if you 
publish--but the Justice Department is not likely to prosecure the 
violation--but, if the Justice Department does prosecuted and you are 
convicted of willfully violating the ITAR then the maximum penalty is a 
million dollar fine and ten years in jail--but you probably can't be 
convicted because the definition of publishing as exporting won't stand up 
in court because it probably violates the First Amendment.

If you've done it, don't worry about it.  After all, you didn't do it 
willfully.  But if you haven't done it yet, then it might be worthwhile to 
worry.  Once one knows that the ITAR in effect defines export as including 
the publishing of technical data and softwrare related to cryptology, it is 
hard to argue that the publication wasn't willfull.

We aren't dealing with law here.  We are dealing with FUD:  Fear, 
Uncertainty, and Dread.

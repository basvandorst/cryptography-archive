Not necessarily. If they can read traffic now from, say, terrorists that use
what they think is an unbreakable system but isn't, and if the terrorists
got hold of the Skipjack algorithm and programmed it without key escrow to
get a really secure system, that wuld definitely be detrimental to national
security, politics aside.

We've even bombed sovereign states in "peacetime" over that issue.

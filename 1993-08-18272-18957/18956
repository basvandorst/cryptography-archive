Are you sure of that?  That hasn't been reflective of my experience, 
nor of the experience of many folks who have taken the time to offer
comment on many recent newsgroup proposals.  Even now, there are
proposals where the proposer is refusing to listen to what little
advice they are being offered in between all the off-topic flame wars.

That's right.  But that has little bearing on reality.  So what if I
have the time to post articles now but didn't at an earlier period. 
All you are doing is;  a)  once again taking my comments out of
context in order to suit you, and b)  demonstrating very questionable
impartiality, both of which I've mentioned already earlier in this
thread.

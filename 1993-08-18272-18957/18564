The chances of an element picked at random from the set being in so
small a loop are pracically zero.  In practice, I think, most elements
are going to be in loops of size about 2^32.  Aren't they?

This shows that

C_i = P_i XOR E_k(i)  (which I'll call "counter mode")

is better than

R_0 = IV; R_{i+1} = E_k{R_i}; C_i = P_i XOR R_i (this is OFB mode, no?)

But my question refers to CBC and CFB modes, which won't get stuck in
loops because the plain text provides a constant seed.  I also suggested
using two previous blocks to square the size of the loops.

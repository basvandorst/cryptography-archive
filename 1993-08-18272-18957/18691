: Notice; request for comments.

: SUMMARY: A Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) for an 
: Escrowed Encryption Standard (EES) is being proposed. This 
: proposed standard specifies use of a symmetric-key 
: encryption/decryption algorithm and a key escrowing method which 
: are to be implemented in electronic devices and used for 
: protecting certain unclassified government communications when 
                                  ^^^^^^^^^^
: such protection is required. The algorithm and the key escrowing 
: method are classified and are referenced, but not specified, in 
: the standard.

Isn't this a good idea, in that it provides us with protection
against misbehaviour BY the government, by providing a 
breakable standard for communications by the government?

I don't believe the government should have the right to 
force us to use something that allows it to snoop on the
people, but it seems right that provision for the people
(via their representatives) to monitor their government
be provided.

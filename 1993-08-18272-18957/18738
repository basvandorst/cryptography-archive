Do you really believe that?  Do you really think that the folks at the
NSA haven't read Kahn?  Just how stupid do you think they are?  (Note
that I'm not talking about values, or political naivete, just plain
technical stupidity.)

There are at least three obvious answers to why NSA tries to keep their
algorithms secret.  (1) Cryptanalysis of an unknown system is *much*
harder, by orders of magnitude.  To give one well-known example,
differential cryptanalysis works because Biham and Shamir know the
S-boxes.  Yes, one must assume that eventually, an enemy will learn the
algorithm.  But other enemies (or nominal friends...) might not.  And
even for folks that do learn it, their attempts at cryptanalysis have
been hampered for some significant amount of time.  (2) If the
algorithm is any good, people will use it against NSA.  I don't think
NSA knowingly deploys weak algorithms, at least for classified use.
(DES and Skipjack excluded...)  (3) The enemy might learn new
cryptographic principles.  (Example:  most public-key cryptograghy is
based on either the discrete log problem or factoring.  Is there
another mathematical structure that would yield strong cryptosystems?
I don't know, but NSA might.  Example:  IDEA uses three different
operations in each round.  To an enemy who had not thought of that, the
very idea (so to speak) could lead to use of yet other operations.)

There are other reasons as well, which I'm sure will occur to many of
you.

I'm continually amused by the dual nature people attribute to NSA.
They're so smart that they can cryptanalyze anything, monitor billions
of phone calls, and electronically scan all of netnews for the one
interesting article a month.  But they're also stupid enough that they
don't know elementary cryptology, they claim their chips are tamper-
proof when ``everyone'' knows that there is no such thing, and their
entire vast apparatus can be bypassed by a clever graduate student who
hasn't read Kahn.

Look -- you may not like NSA.  (I'm not fond of many of their
activities myself.)  But you're not going to beat them by belittling
their abilities.  Try the scientific method:  form several hypotheses
to explain some action, and see which best fits other available data
(or experiments...).  I submit that my reasoning for why NSA keeps
cryptosystems secret is rather more plausible.

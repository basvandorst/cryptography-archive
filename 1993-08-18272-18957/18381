Ah, but the real question is whether the copyright itself will
hold up. There's this thing called "merger" where if a judge
finds that the idea and the expression of the idea come to the
same thing, you can no longer copyright the result. This is
what stops people from copyrighting the code to add two multiple-
precision numbers or a bunch of other stuff where there's 
effectively only one way to write the code in question. Since
this code basically says "Do X if and only if a bunch of bytes
of the following sequence exists at location Y," you could make
a fairly good argument that idea and expression have merged. 

I think there was a case much like this in the middle days of
the original IBM PC, where some code would only work if it
found "Copyright 19XX, IBM Corp" at a specific ROM location
and people who made clones were not being sued for including
that text in their own ROMs (albeit they were sometimes sued
for other things).

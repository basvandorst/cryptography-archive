Essentially the same proof:  Under those conditions, any a^3 has 9 cube
roots, and 4 of them allow you to factor n, as a^3-b^3 =(a-b)(a^2+ab+b^2),
and 4 of the 9 cube roots have only one of p and q dividing a-b.

I suppose it possible that the other 4 provide some information, but the
best I can come up with is that once you have a "near-miss" (a != b, but
n divides a^2+ab+b^2), 6 of the 9 give you sufficient information.  The
proof is similar.

Also, if only one of p is (3k+1) and q is (3k-1), then any cube root of
a^3 is congruent to a (mod q), and so, if different from a, provides a
factorization.

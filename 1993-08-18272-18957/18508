Unfortunately using DES in CFB mode, even with a random IV
will produce cycles (repetitive loops) that are perfectly 
predictable.  Same problem with *all* feedback techniques.

One way to get around this problem in a practical way is
to use a hypbrid cipher system that uses DES in CBC mode
output fed into a provably very-long-period additive indexed
stream cipher (essentially a shift register cipher with a 
very long period (say, >3000 bits)).

The long period part prevents cycles from every happening in
the human time scale and compensates for the short DES key;
the DES portion prevents the known-plaintext inversion
attack that the shift-register method is vulnerable to.

This kind of systems has been called a 'laminated' system;
the great advantage is that you can use already studied techniques
whose individual strengths cover the individual weaknesses of the
other parts. The disadvantage is that there might be an interaction
among the parts that was not anticipated that might weaken the
entire system (although a contingency among systems thought
independent would be a wonderful discovery).

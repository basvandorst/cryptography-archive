The defense again "man-in-middle" attacks is key signing.  If I see
a PGP key from someone I don't know, but it is signed by two or
three of my closest friends, I have a much stronger level of trust
with this user.  Of course, even a signed key can be spoofed, but
it would require spoofing every public key of all the people I trust.
Possible, but very difficult.

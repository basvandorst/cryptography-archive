I appologize for cluttering this newsgroup, which is obviously devoted to
the theoretical aspects of encryption, but I am not sure where else to look.

Where can I find a decent Public Key Encryption Program?  I am running
OS/2 and UNIX, so either option would be fine.

No, I do not really understand the theory behind these programs - it is
something I intend to look into as I start programming - in the mean time,
I want to protect my mail.

Thanks, and again, sorry for interrupting your discussions.

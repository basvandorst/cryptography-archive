Steve:

Since I posted it to rec.radio.shortwave and have followed up by notifying 
the appropriate authorities that this happened so they might correct
the problem, if they weren't already aware of it, guess there is no harm in
posting it to sci.crypt. I did restrict it to USA, but already have evidence
that this doesn't count for diddly in who can read it (-:. You might post this 
along with the message. Thanks for your interest. Also, so I won't be
pestered to death, note that I will provide no further information 
regarding time, frequency, content, which ought to satisfy any "security"
interests.

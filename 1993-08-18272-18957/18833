There is a bit of a confusion here: 'cracking' might refer to recovering
the plaintext by guessing the key by structured guessing or it might
refer to breaking a cipher through analysis of the ciphertext only.

'Injecting random words' to distinguish stereotyped messages is pretty exactly
what a 'salt' is.  Other systems may call it an Initializing Vector or
might prepend some quantity of random data coupled with a 'chaining' mode
of encryption to have the effect you describe.

But your description of the experiments makes me think they were guessing
the key via a precomputed data set.  This is in fact very effective and
as ciphers in general get stronger will probably be the main feasible attack
in the future.

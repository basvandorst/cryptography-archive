The distinctions between a CCEP Type I implmentation and the MYK-78:

	MYK-78				Type I

	Can fish for CCW		rigid key management (microcoded)
	(Crypto Check Word)		

	allows user to make up		uses supplied keys
	key

	keys are  en clair		keys may be distributed in clear 
				        or encrypted (unclassified)

	Single port			red/black Separation

	Control Processor		Control Processor SW certified
	Software not rigidly
	controlled?

	general peripheral		certified physical implementation

	Law Enforcement Enabling	Remote Rekeying/Zeroizing
	Field

	unclassified only		Classified

The lack of red/black separation (even through certified control processor
software) and lack of mandated key management are sufficient to prevent 
certification for classified data.

There are other issues besides key escrow still outstanding.  Someone ought to
look at all the programmable options in the chips (control software, options
with respect to Law Enforcement Access Fields) as well as the chip
implementations in general.  (well imagine that, if you mutilate the
LEAF Field for both devices the keys for both are zeroized!).

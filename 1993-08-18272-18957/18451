this::
 I am trying to decide if I can shorten the length of the 
512 bit DSS in order to reduce the computational burden
posed by computing the DSS function. The application I have in mind
has a short life data object that needs to be signed for less then a few
hours. Assume a reliable protocol and a periodic key change of a day or so.

Briefly, I assume that breaking a shortened DSS might be possible 
but that wouldn't affect my security as long as they couldn't break the
DSS key pair I was currently using. If I changed the pairs at a resonable
interval, I think it could be trusted to provide authentication/integrity
for a while. 

I'd appreciate any constructive thoughts on the matter. Has anyone
seen any literature that supports or denies what I've proposed?

With one notable exception, the list obtained is more remarkable for its 
omissions than for the countries included.

In 1945, almost all the countries listed can be reasonably assumed to have 
been either using German or US-donated systems. The notable exception is 
Switzerland, which has a long and stong tradition of independent development 
of quality cryptosystems.

Whatever happened to Russia? :-)

Right.  The way the ITAR work is to make it a matter of simple common sense 
that one not exercise one's right, guaranteed by the first amendment to the 
United States Constituion, to talk about or publish information about 
cryptographic software, algorithms, etc.  But in working that way the ITAR 
are clearly unconstitutional.  So the obvious solution is to bring suit to 
declare that the ITAR are--or more specifically that portion of the ITAR 
that purports to require a license before one can speak or publish is--
unconstitutional.

One wonders if Mr. Sternlight would like to join in that suit as a plaintiff?

I doubt they were told something then told it could not be in the
report.  This would compromise them and their report greatly.  Possible,
but, if true, reputations would be soiled (at the least).

If you can get Ft. Meade to comment in any manner about their decryption
abilities, I'd be amazed.  Once something is public, then all the
folks in netland who know that something would be able to comment on it.

This is why, for example, they refuse to admit they can easily read DES,
even though lots of folks, including most of the crypto community and
the FSU and TPC (The Phone Company!) know this.  But the folks who know
can't PUBLICLY comment on it because the information is not officially 
public.  [Orwellian, to say the least.]

I don't think our real problem here is a big disinformation scam by
the NSA and the panel of experts.  The NSA is not going to great pains
to be forthcoming, but if they are caught lying to Congress and the
general public, ... well, this is the kind of thing that could bring
down their house of cards.

Any Daniel Ellsbergs out there?

I think I was the first person to post a rebuttal of Dr. Denning's original
post on the Interim Report.  I suspect that Dr. Denning is caught up in a
situation where there is merit on both sides and finds, by virtue of her
situation, most of the important input she directly receives, comes from the
side opposite my viewpoint.

But I must state, nothing I have ever seen Dr. Denning say or do, would merit
such an negative statement as quoted above.  

Please, let's try to keep the level of discussion in sci.crypt on a civil
and non-personal basis as possible.  It makes reading the newsgroups much
more plesant :)

Yes, I do.

Some cultures/times seem better at keeping secrets than others.

Two stores from BP era.

1) During the war, the King came to BP on a tour.  While there, he saw
a friend of his daughter, who had been her regular guest at the Palace.
The King said {roughly}:
"Hello, Susan. How are you? What is YOUR job here?"
Her reply:
"I'm not allowed to tell you, your Highness"

2) A decade or so after the war, one of the heads of BP was at a party.
(Sorry, his name has dropped onto a bad block of MY memory) The wife of
a MP said to him "I doubt you will recall me, but I worked for you in
Hut 6." Her husband said in surprise "So THAT'S what you did during the
war."

Secrets are NSA's business. From my limited professional dealings with
them, I'm sure they have plenty more than we think....

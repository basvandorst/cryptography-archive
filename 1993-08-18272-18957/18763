I've seen procedures for logically flipping a coin by phone.  They tend
to be complicated.  What's wrong with the following one?

	1. Party A generates large primes p and q, with p = 1 mod 4,
	and q = 3 mod 4.

	2. Party A tells party B pq.

	3. Party B picks one of the following two statements and makes it
	to A:

		"I call heads iff p > q"
	or

		"I call tails iff p > q"

	4. A tells B whether B got heads or tails, and reveals p and q
	so that B can verify that A is telling the truth.

I'm guessing something is wrong, because some of the methods I've seen
start with multiplying two large primes, and then get complicated, with
the parties computing square roots mod pq and other messy things.  If
the simpler method above worked, there would be no need for the complicated
methods, hence I assume that the simpler method doesn't work.  But why?
Given a large integer n, known to be the product of two primes, one = 1 mod
4, and the other = 3 mod 4, is there a way to determine which prime is
larger without factoring n?

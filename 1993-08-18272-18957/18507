Yes, this is possible.

You've described a "Cryptographically Strong PRNG".  Check the literature.

BTW, it's not "one time pad".  It's a stream cipher.

Traditionally, OTP refers only to the use of true random numbers as key
while "stream cipher" covers the case of XOR of bytes with the output of
a PRNG.

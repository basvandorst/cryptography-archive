Yes, this has been known since 1964 and it is mentioned in David Kahn's
The Codebreakers. The machine that was broken was the Siemens
Geheimschreiber machine type T52 A/B that was used on the connections
Oslo-Copenhagen-Berlin, Oslo-Trondheim, Oslo-Narvik and Oslo-Stockholm.
Further connections over Swedish territory was Stockholm-Berlin and 
Stockholm-Helsingfors. All these links were partly going over leased
Swedish land lines that the Swedish intelligence service were tapping.

In the summer of 1940 Professor Arne Beurling, a mathematics professor
from Uppsala University, succeeded in a cryptanalytical break of the
T52 machine and was able to construct a deciphering machine. The
break was successful until the Germans were warned by the Finns that
the Swedes were reading their T52 traffic.  On 17 June 1942 the Germans
changed their traffic from Swedish lines over to other lines in
existence between Denmark and Norway and Norway and Finland, and they
also introduced new T52 machines with improved security. The traffic
on the link Stockholm-Berlin continues to the end of the war, but as
the new machines were much more secure the output shrunk drastically in
1943 and 1944.

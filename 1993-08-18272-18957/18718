What's this "would" ?

Criminals have been using crypto to mask communications and protect their
records for *years*.  Kahn's "Codebreakers" has some nice stories along
those lines.

Why do people keep talking about crypto as if it had been invented
yesterday?  Is it just that we like to think we're in a brave new world
which our fathers never guessed would look like this?

We are -- to some extent -- but strong crypto in the hands of the public
isn't one of the novelties.  The personal computer is, but not strong
crypto.

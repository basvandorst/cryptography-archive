While I agree with this in principle, It 
may over-simplify.  First, the NSA does
not believe in "ANY civilian crypto."  
While, at least at an intellectual level,
they recognize the need for limited 
COMMERCIAL crypto, at another level they
believe that they are licensing what is
intrinsically their turf.

Second, their role in civilian crypto is
to protect the efficiency of signals 
intelligence.  This motive over-rides 
every other consideration.  

It is naive to believe that the purpose
of CLIPPER, i.e., hardware-only, 
implementation of SKIPJACK is to 
protect national security interests in
its cryptography.  Rather it is to 
prevent easily replicated software
implementations, Denning and Sternlight's
repitition of this nonsense to the 
contrary notwithstanding, it remains
nonsense.  That is why no one here can
make any sense of it.

If you would understand what NSA does, you 
must never forget all the jobs at Fort Meade
and the executive power that goes with them.

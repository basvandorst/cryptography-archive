  True, but not particularly significant.  Obviously, building in a trapdoor
would backfire if they got caught at it; however, I trust that I need not
recite a long litany of things the government has done despite the fact
that those things could and did backfire when they got caught.
  Like any common criminal, government bureaucrats do these things on the
assumption that they will -not- get caught.

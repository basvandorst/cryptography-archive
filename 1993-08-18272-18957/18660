What do you mean by 'cast into a 3rd dimensional construct'?

Your scheme doesn't work very well at ensuring a random appearance for
the data after encryption.

For instance, suppose I encrypt a long stream of all-bits-zero.
Someone looking at the encrypted output will notice that zero bits
are more common than

What do you mean by 'linear'?

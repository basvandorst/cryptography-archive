Hi,

Could anyone suggest GOOD sources for getting substantial technical
information on Ecnryption Key Management.  Are there any FAQs which have good
info or a site or a book on this subject.

Any help is appreciated - you could probably send me an email - will 
summarize if enough info comes around.

Thanx - srini

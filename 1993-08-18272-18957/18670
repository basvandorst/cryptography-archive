I assume he meant VTAM Session Level Encryption (SLE).  A new session
key is randomly assigned (using DES as a pseudo-random number generator)
for each session (at BIND time).  The key is sent encrypted with a
key-encrypting key that has been set up between the partners from the
primary LU to the secondary LU.  The key-encrypting keys are 16 bytes
(for the triple DES encryption scheme used by IBM), the session keys
are 8 bytes (single DES).

Both sides need encryption hardware, typically a 4755 crypto adapter
in the workstation and an Integrated Cryptographic Facility (ICRF)
in the host machine.

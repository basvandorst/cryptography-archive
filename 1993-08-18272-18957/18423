They fundamentally are. You can detect one of them _only_ by assuming
that there aren't others.

Yes, _if_. That's a big assumption.

No---how do you know that the receiver you've synchronized clocks with 
isn't actually the eavesdropper, posing as your legitimate receiver? The 
answer is that you don't.

And there's no reason he can't do this.

I have read a few papers which claim, incorrectly, that certain 
protocols prevent active attacks. The correct claim is that they raise 
the extent to which an active attacker must participate in the protocol.

And, conversely, no matter what things you do, a sufficiently determined 
active attacker will be able to get around you. Remember: everyone 
you've ever met is working for the CIA. There is absolutely no way you 
can prove otherwise.

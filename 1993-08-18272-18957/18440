RSAREF is available via anonymous ftp from rsa.com, in the rsaref directory.
It compiles under PC-DOS, VMS and Unix under a lot of architectures.  It's
biggest drawback is that it only handles small files that fit entirely into
memory.  The char arrays are dimensioned to only 1000 (NOT using #define), but
it shouldn't be too hard to increase.

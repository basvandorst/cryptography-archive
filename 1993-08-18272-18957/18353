I don't mean to defend Skipjack, but the fact is that there are 
successful active attacks on _every_ cryptosystem.

From last September:

: For all you know, Terry, there could be a middleman between you and the
: entire rest of the world. Call him God if you want. He's spoofing every
: message your eyes send to your brain! (In fact he switched purple and
: yellow when you were a kid.) Nothing you can ever do will prove the
: non-existence of this middleman, or remove his interference. Do you
: care?
: 
: Public-key cryptography ensures continuity, in a sense that is easy to
: define mathematically. If you want more than continuity---if, for
: instance, you want to stop God from spoofing your messages---then I'm
: afraid you're up the creek. That doesn't negate the usefulness of
: public-key cryptography for the real world.

Similar comments apply to Skipjack.

Does anyone has access to a program to crack the code for
word perfect password protected files ? The password can
be eight characters long and the cipher is probably straightforward.
I'd be most happy if someone in the wordperfect organisation
could supply a program, or could inform me if they'll decipher
it for me. Both the wp copy and the files are legal, but the 
owner has lost the passwords (yes, that does happen).

Your implication being that triple DES is somehow "easier" to break than
single DES?  This must not be what you are saying, because it is patently
absurd.

It could be that triple DES is not has hard to break as it "should" be;
but only if one uses subkeys for the single-DES parts that are not
truely independent, OR if there is indeed some "backdoor" into DES that
makes cryptanalysis of triple-DES easier.  If DES is strong enough that
only an exaustive key-search will break it, then triple-DES can't be weaker.

Keeping key bits random and independent is as much a problem for 54 bits
as 108, so that really isn't much of a handicap peculiar to triple-DES.
I very much doubt the "backdoor" hypothesis; I think it would be found by now.

I'm forced to conclude that the NSA does not want to encourage triple-DES
because they'd have a hard time breaking it.

The escrowed keys values are purportedly two 80 bit values that are XORed
to form an 80 bit value that is the unit key.  D. Dennings description of
the unit key generation shows it unlikely to find a unit key from one of
the escrowed halves, and no short cuts based on how the unit keys are
generated (as long as the two 80 bit seed values from the escrow agents 
are both held secret).

It is a shared secret system with two parties and a threshold equal to
two.  

Apparently the Law Enforcement Access Field (LEAF or LEEF historically) is 
the same mechanism used previously for remote rekeying.  

What is new is the escrow mechanism, which is apparently borrowed from
nuclear release enabling technology.

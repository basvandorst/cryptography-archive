Yes, the FAQ describes the modes, but not what they're protecting you
from.  The application is encrypting files, all with the same secret
key, so I'm not generating random session keys or IVs like I would for
a communications application.  Can the IV be considered as just an
extention to the IDEA key?  I know the best world is to have a truely
random IV, but would a non-random but variable IV (say, one based on
the sector address) be any improvement over a fixed one?

I'm doing research here at the Naval Postgraduate School and I need
some information concerning word frequencies in the English language
-- specifically frequencies of words that are three letters long or
less.  If anyone knows where I can get this information, please e-mail
me at galvint@taurus.cs.nps.navy.mil.  Thank you in advance.

The panel who reviewed the Skipjack algorithm confirm that it is not
breakable at the present state of the art in any reasonable time.

What hard evidence have you for this assertion? Others here who have
expertise have said that they believe DES is readable with currently
available technology at a reasonable price. NSA has all but confirmed that
between the lines in their Clipper documents.

NSA was a party to creating DES for use in the civil sector.


>NSA does not want any civilian or commercial use of crypto at all.

This is patently false. NSA is responsive to policy directives from the
White House and Cabinet Officers, and it is now U.S. policy to help the
private sector protect their communications from foreigners. NSA has been
tasked with this mission and has devoted both resources and good faith to
it. For details, do a literature search on, for example, the New York Times,
or write to the NSA PIO.

This is only one of NSA's missions. It has always had a major mission of
Communications Security.

This is false. News items have repeatedly remarked on the use of crypto by
both druggies and foreign intelligence operatives (spies).

No problem. Triple DES might take more resources to read, but DES appears
straightforward based on what I read here.

There's no need for that in a substantive discussion. It's been long obvious
that some who disagree with me are unable to sustain a technical argument
unaided by personal attack. If you can't control yourself, take it to
alt.fan.david-sternlight where your fellow flamers hang out (without me, I
might add).

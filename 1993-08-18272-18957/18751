   What are drug dealers supposed to be using Cryptography for?  [...]
   I would have thought that cars and guns were
   rather higher up their list of tools than DES boxes.

Presumably for suppliers and customers to tell each other what they want,
and when, and haggle about prices, and discuss delivery details and problems,
which is much cleaner with good secure phone fax than if you've got to say
	Tell Aunt MaryJane I want 3 large brownies on Sunday,
	and that I had to lend Cousin Manuel $50 for bus fare.

Personally, as far as defining Bad Guys goes, people selling people
stuff they want is just capitalism; if one government's competing
with another about who gets to take over a small third country,
there's not a lot of moral difference, and if the foreign intelligence
operatives would let the American public know what our government's up to,
that's really a public service....

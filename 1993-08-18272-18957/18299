I have heard that, at least as of a few months ago, there was someone
actually serving time in prison for exporting VC II units due to the
ITAR prohibition on exporting cryptographic devices.  Supposedly the
individual ignored warnings and pushed his luck too far...

If anyone has further information about this case or others involving
violations of the crypto-export clause of the ITAR (if there are any  --
I've asked quite a few people involved with crypto about actual cases
resuling in prison time due to crypto export, and this is the only
one I've come across) please post.

crashed hard disk, so please be patient and persistent if you send me
something and are waiting for a reply... :-)

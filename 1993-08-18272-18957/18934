Hello,

Finally, after some delay, I will summarize the responses I got to the 
following query I posted on some news groups:

<From: kahan@irisa.fr (Jose KAHAN)
<
<Hello,
<
<I+'m a student working on a PhD dealing with the security of 
<distributed multimedia interactive applications. 
<
<
<I would appreciate any references that you could give me. My 
<main interest is in access control policies and mechanisms. 
<
<I would also like to enter in contact with other people working 
<in this (or other) field(s) of distributed multimedia security.

I didn't receive many answers, maybe because of the holidays? 

Anyway, if someone would still like to answer to the original query, I 
could update this summary and send it again.

Thanks to all the people who responded to my question.

Now the summary of responses:

==============================================

I received 5 replies.

the University of Twente in the Netherlands  wrote:

Remark: I did not attach the report in this summary.

Remark: This approach is similar to that of project ATHENA of the MIT, 
where the DCE architecture is augmented to accommodate distributed 
multimedia applications.

I did search tenet's ftp server but didn't find any document relating 
to security. I also found (and read) a summary of recent and current 
research of the tenet group but did not catch any mention to security.

I would respectfully like to join this wager as well.  Of course, my
city of residence is over in Western Massachusetts, so perhaps DS will
have to do a lot of travelling to collect his meals in the unlikely
(IMHO) event that he wins.  Then again, maybe if he loses he'll have
to take half the USENET out to dinner -- sounds like quite a galla
afair.  There's always the danger, however, that such a dinner *might*
resolve DS's quandry over my gender (but I'll just have to avoid
wearing anything too revealing:  baggy clothes, neutral haircut, etc.
:-)). 

Yours, Lulu...

My understanding of the "Man in the Middle" is that he must control
*all* channels between the two parties that he wants to tap.

The problem comes when you have something like a secure telephone, where
the two parties have not shared any previous information.  With
something like Clipper, the phone line is the only channel available and
the MitM cleans up.

Key management procedures introduce at least one extra channel that the
MitM has to subvert, whether it's a guy with a briefcase handcuffed to
his wrist or some form of "computer notary".

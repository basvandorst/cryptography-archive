PLease tell us WHICH legislatrix.  WHICH special interest group? I think
credit should be given where due, don't you?

I, for one, would like to know who/what group was so callous as to hold
up emergency relief to flood victims for their own political agenda,
probably one which only benefits a certain group (can you say special
interest?).

I thought the Demos were making a very big point of they "were not going
to be pandering to special interests, like their predecessors".   Was
it a Conservative special interest that held up this emergency relief bill
to what was effectively blackmail?  Somehow, I doubt it.

The point relative to crypo and the Clipper is, what is to prevent a
maneuver of a similar type being used to break the "promise" that strong
non-escrowed crypto would not be outlawed?   What is to prevent someone
in the Administration (or congress, acting for the FBI, etc) from putting
such a rider outlawing crypto on an unrelated "must have" bill?

See, that is why I consider such promises or commitments worthless.
Assuming that the persons making the promises WERE being sincere, the
promise gets broken "because 'they' made me do it".   That is why there
would have to be a LAW prohibiting a ban, or better yet, a Supreme Court
opinion stating that it would be unconstitutional before I could believe that
such a promise made today wouldn't be broken tomorrow.  An honest
face-value interpretation of the Constitution just seems to have no
clout anymore.  We hear the old saw "because we have this horrendous
problem with terrorists(tm) and drug dealers(tm), we need to suspend
some of those out-of-date protections" because we cannot deal with it
ANY other way...

One could optimise bit permutations by table lookup; even if they don't use
64-bit lookup, using 16-bit lookup (which implies a table with 2^16 16-bit
entries) would help reducing permutations and is quite feasable. I don't
know about Crays, but perhaps you could put so much core into them (it's
only 4 gigabytes, after all) that they can even do 32-bit tables.

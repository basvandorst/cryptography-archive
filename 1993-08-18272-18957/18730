I agree with the characterization as a a Vigenere-like autokey cipher
(taken generally) and the analogy with CBC mode.  However, it's not nearly
as easy as the standard usage of autokey. "Traditional" autokey looks like:

  Plaintext:  Across the sands of Syria, or possibly Algeria, or some...
  Key:        initialization vectorAcross the sands of Syria, or poss...
  Ciphertext: [Plaintext XOR Key]

This "traditional" autokey is extremely vulnerable because as soon as you
find any crib as long as the IV the rest of it unravels trivially, and a
shorter crib gives you islands of plaintext to expand in both directions.
The cipher described is different because the key is taken in
plaintext-dependent permuted order, so straightforward crib-dragging won't
give instant gratification.  I suspect that a fairly good-sized chunk of
crib (maybe as long as the ring buffer, or somewhat longer?) will allow
entry, but perhaps not trivially.  I agree that it must be weaker than
Enigma, as Daniel F says.

Do you know of a specific break on this system, or one like it?

For contributors and spectators of the DS flame-fest:


    Deep peace I breathe into you,
    Deep peace, a soft white dove to you;
    Deep peace, a quiet rain to you;
    Deep peace, an ebbing wave to you!

    Deep peace, red wind of the east to you;
    Deep peace, grey wind of the west to you;
    Deep peace, dark wind of the north to you;
    Deep peace, blue wind of the south to you!

    Deep peace, pure red of the flame to you;
    Deep peace, pure white of the moon to you;
    Deep peace, pure green of the grass to you;
    Deep peace, pure brown of the earth to you;
    Deep peace, pure grey of the dew to you;
    Deep peace, pure blue of the sky to you!

    Deep peace of the running wave to you;
    Deep peace of the flowing air to you;
    Deep peace of the quiet earth to you;
    Deep peace of the sleeping stones to you;
    Deep peace of the Yellow Shepherd to you;
    Deep peace of the Wandering Shepherdess to you;
    Deep peace from the flock of stars to you!

    Deep peace from the Son of Peace,
    Deep peace, deep peace!

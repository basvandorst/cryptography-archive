   Something just occurred to me...
   There's supposed to be a key escrow system from which my (or anyone else's)
law enforcement keys are available.  Presumably, this means that when I'm
sold the SKIPJACK phone, I'm somehow registered as having the phone with key
X.
   What's to keep me from stealing someone else's phone?

   In the event I'm wrong about this (possible; somewhere in my dim memory
there's a reference about the phone transmitting some identifier that
corresponds to the key set), what's to keep me from (1) buying or (2) stealing
another phone every time I want to have a conversation?  The Gov't might be
able to record and decrypt every conversation, but the sheer amount of
paperwork, court appearances for warrants, flagellation of the key escrow
agencies for a new key set every time, etc. that, if enough people did it,
it would become untenable.  Just think: the courts would be busy enough
granting warrants to eavesdrop on drug dealers, they wouldn't have time
to prosecute them!

There are several ways to measure floating gates.  I'm also fairly
confident that some group will reverse engineer the Blackjack algorithm.
One could make a Clipper-compatible phone that doesn't require key

Those secret Myko docs have been up for anonymous ftp from my site
for quite a while.  ftp into netcom.com and get myko2 etc etc
from pub/trimm.

GREAT opening line, Sternlight.  Really sets the mood for any discussion
to follow.  If it isn't pro-Big Brother, its automatically inflammatory...
It is safe to assume that your position is rather well-known, and on which
side of the issue you are firmly entrenched.

You have said nothing to suggest that you do not advocate a government
monopoly of all meaningful power in this country, both over privacy and
ability to apply force.  Problem is, there are some folks in which the role
of sheep obeying their masters just does not go down well at all.

If the above is in error, please let us know how you feel about an
unconnected individual's right to privacy, and the right to have the
means to apply force if and when necessary.  Show us how your position
does not advocate a government monopoly on control of privacy and force.
Note that 'being in the government' does not make a person suddenly
blessed with perfect judgement, or the ethics of Mother Teresa.

Note (still rumor - I am trying to find supporting reference) - I have
heard the FBI recently did a wiretap, and got crypto instead of clear
speech - and so have renewed their push to institute a ban on decent
crypto without government holding the keys as far as unprivileged common
folk are concerned.  If this turns out to be accurate, one can say
so much for any *$&@#)$# government "promises" or "assurances".  Perhaps
some other reader (or yourself) can help verify or debunk the above
story.

I know I am strange - If an entity burns me several times in the past,
I tend to not believe any promises from that entity they won't do so
this time, without something to make it IMPOSSIBLE for that entity to
burn me again.  That is something notably lacking in our government
assurances, promises and guarantees (given with fingers crossed).  They
can do whatever the hell they want OUTSIDE the US, the Constitution has
no force there.  But to have them treat the citizen of this country -
their bosses in theory, at least - as if he were a deadly enemy to the
all-precious STATE until proven otherwise goes against everything this
country was founded on as far as I am concerned.  Obviously, you disagree
on that score.

Meanwhile, the real issue, to me, is that in the 4000 year history of
cryptography, private citizens have *always* had and been free to use
strong cryptography (as strong as that used by the military of the time)
and no government has ever had the temerity to even suggest that citizens
surrender keys to the government.

There is no reason to start now.

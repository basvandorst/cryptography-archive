Most classical cipher systems (pen-and-paper types) can be
identified by the experienced cryptanalyst.  The simplest
ones would be simple substitution, digraphic, grid, and
transposition.  These types have a lot of characteristics
that are easy to spot.

For modern, computer ciphers, perhaps there are some
mathematical tests, but I wouldn't know...

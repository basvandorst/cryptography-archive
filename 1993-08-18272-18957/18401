In all the followups, I have noticed one element
missing. Dr. Denning's report confirms the fact
that, once the escrow process is complete, the Law
Enforcers can decrypt all past or future
conversations using that device; it is forever
compromised. Only technology limits how much
recording of conversations can be done. There
doesn't seem to be a process which ensures that
the key released from escrow is completely
destroyed at the end of the wiretap period.

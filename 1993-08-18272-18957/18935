How'd *you* like to be the NSA guy that had broken factoring?
That'd have to be a rather strange position to be in: a big star in
a miniscule universe.
You'd have to sit by quietly every year Nobels were handed out.
Every numbers conference would find you on pins and needles-- has
someone else found the magic solution, and will he/she get all the
glory? Might you be negotiating with your employers, so that
evidence of your discovery would be released when and if the public
sector found out? I guess NSA would have to agree to terms like
that, or they might have difficulty getting the most precocious
minds...
On the other hand, can you imagine yourself as a private-sector
mathemetician who has deduced the trick, and proudly strutted it
forth before amazed colleagues, only to have NSA say, "Yes, OK,
we've had that since 1974."
How do you think NSA deals with something like this? Beyond all
the Official Secrets Act, etc., they have got to keep their guys
happy.

It seems silly to rule out cryptography, since clearly only from that field
can a solution be expected.

Cryptographers have developed a technique called zero-knowledge proof, which
can be used for authentication similar to what you are asking for.  The
authentication might involve a numeric "challenge" from the vendor who wants
to authenticate the customer, followed by a response message from the
customer which would make use of some information that only he would have.
The interchange is done in such a way that an eavesdropper (or the vendor
himself) obtains NO information that would allow him to impersonate that
customer in the future.

Unfortunately, all zero-knowledge proof systems known require mathematical
abilities which seem beyond human capability.  However, a person augmented
with a card computer could easily do the calculations, and read off the
results over the phone (or let his card computer's built-in modem signal
the vendor's computer).

This approach would seem to satisfy your requirements.

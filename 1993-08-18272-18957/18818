Yes, that has the advantage that several `coins' may be flipped without 
having to generate two large primes for each new coin toss. One may 
evaluate the Jacobi symbol (as is needed in Blum's coin flipping protocol) 
more quickly than one can generate two large primes (even using 
probabilistic tests for primality). However, for a single coin toss
Tim's protocol is faster/simpler.

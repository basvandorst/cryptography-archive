Lots of people I talk to, from credit-cards to telephone service to
book clubs, use social-security and/or telephone to verify identity.
They figure that both of these are things which I'm likely to know off
the top of my head, but few other people are.  Obviously, neither of
these is very difficult to crack with a small amount of effort -- but
either will deter totally casual cranks.  These, like mother's maiden
name can easily be recorded by unscrupulous third-parties.

Yours, Lulu...

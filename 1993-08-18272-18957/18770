Greetings from a newbie,

On brute decryption there seems to be a reliance on detecting when the 
message makes sense. I assume that some encryptions use two or more
algorithms so that even when the correct decription for one algorithm
is applied, the message still is not intellegable, e.g. clipper algorithm
followed by DES.  Is there a technical term for this process, i.e.  term of
the art?

What happens if a message is run twice through the same encryption
algorithm, assuming the encryption alogithm does not also decrypt.  Does the
resulting message have to be decrypted twice or will it yield to brute force
using one key?  Any special term for this.

Can post processing the clipper output with another algoritm add any security? 

Any benefit from using two different clipper chips to do the encryption?

Many thanks for answers, (which I gather from current posts you probably
have already given to other newbies.)

Sincerely,
Bill Thomas

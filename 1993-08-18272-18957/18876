Yes, and once you've typed everything into the ATM, it encrypts a
packet containg the card number, your PIN and your request, sends it
the the server and gets back an encrypted packet saying either
"dispense the funds" or "get lost, deadbeat".  By the way, a few months
back some bozos here in St. Louis stole an ATM machine using a stolen
tow truck.  That night, the local news had the picures from the video
camera showing excellent closeups of the thieves wrapping chains around
the ATM, etc.

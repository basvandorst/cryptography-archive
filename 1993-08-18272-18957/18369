   Looks like it.  How much ULTRA HYPER GIGA EXTREMELY SUPER TOP SECRET
information has leaked out of this country in past years?  Figuring that
the espionage trials we've been aware of are only the tip of the iceberg,
IMHO it won't be long before someone with SECRET clearance leaks the info
out of the country to some place like Singapore, which has an awful lot of
IC fabrication facilities, and gets implemented with good SKIPJACK but
none of the law enforcement parts done right.  Thus those who are making
huge amounts of money running drugs will find easy availability of
uncrackable communications (providing SKIPJACK is indeed all it's cracked
up to be), while the average schlubs like you and me will find our sex
lives open to any law enforcement agency who gets wind of our using the
word "plutonium" over the phone.

   (Disclaimer to keep the FBI from my door: I'm not cleared by the Gov't
at ALL, I have no interest in such espionage, I have no access to any
such information and probably never could because my lack of a
college degree would probably preclude me from being hired for any job
even remotely related to this stuff.)

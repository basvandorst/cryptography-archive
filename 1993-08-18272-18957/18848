The advantage to the more complex protocols, such as Manuel Blum's
(presented at COMPCON 82), is that they can be proven secure under
the assumption that factoring is hard.  Under Blum's protocol, 
the "flipper" can cheat only if he can factor, and the "caller"
has no chance to cheat at all.

It's not too hard to come up with reasonable coin-flip protocols
based on symetric ciphers or (as Tim Smith did in another post) 
hash functions.  Blum got his published because he had a nice proof.

Concerning the above protocol, Richard Tobin pointed out that 
B has to check the primality of p and q.  Gábor Megyesi thought
that it would be difficult to find a, b, and c such that both
a*b and a*c pass the primality tests.  The commonly used primality 
tests (such as the Miller-Rabin test - see Knuth vol II sec 4.5.4) 
assure a small probabillity of a composite passing the test
regardless of what composites they are given.  There are no
composites which "pass the primality tests", so Megyesi is correct 
that they are hard to find.

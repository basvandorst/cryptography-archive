Let's assume that legitimate SKIPJACK devices cannot communicate with
FAKE devices which do not know the Family Key. This means that a FAKE
device has to know the Family Key in addition to the SKIPJACK
algorithm.

There are two explanations:

SKIPJACK has a backdoor which is obvious when one examines the
algorithm.

or

Our (sorry, Your, I am not an American) expert panel is not very
competent. Perhaps they have not thought themselves but just copied
some NSA propaganda verbatim.

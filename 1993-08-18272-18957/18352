Lots of people, on the basis of nothing more than their faith in the  
First Amendment, do exactly that. They publish crypto without fear of 
the export controls.

The State Department is not stupid enough to bring this issue up in 
court. After all, the Justice Department thinks ITAR's restrictions on 
publication are unconstitutional. So does Congress. So does every other
legal expert who has expressed an opinion on the issue.

When I pointed out that there seems to be no way to ``place something in
the public domain under the ITAR,'' I didn't mean to discourage anyone
from publishing crypto, or to imply that anyone would be thrown in jail
for publishing crypto. (As Charles Ray of the State Department said: ``I 
don't want to say he can't do it. Because we don't have thought police, 
we don't have any way of being out there.'')

But the fact remains that arms-control isn't like copyright. You can 
waive copyright; you can't waive arms control. The State Department 
probably can't control publications, but they _say_ they can, and the 
ITAR seems to say so too.

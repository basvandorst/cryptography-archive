That's the point. I don't believe that they are that stupid. But they
apparently(!) are stupid enough to *claim* they were that stupid. :-) 

The Skipjack review was done, according to Denning, by people who
*knew* the algorithm. Because, IMHO, it can be now universally
accepted that you haven't really evaluated a cryptosystem until you
have tried *all* known forms of attacks, some of which require
knowledge about the algorithm.

Then, where is the point in keeping it secret? You give the explanation:

This assumption is far too weak to rely national security upon,
provided NSA is not stupid ;-) 

In crypto, there is IMHO no such thing as "a bit secure", just like
there is no "a bit pregnant". Either an algorithm is known, or it has
to be treated with the same care as a secret key. Now apply the above
argument, "must assume that eventually...", to a secret key. Then the
whole cryptography would become moot...

Right, but why don't they do anything to relieve doubts about that
fact?

That's a valid point, perhaps. However, cryptographers have to assume
that the enemy is as smart as themselves and could find these
principles by themselves.

An example, not fully fitting here but a point against keeping designs
secret: It is now assumed that the DES design was kept secret only to
keep the principle of differential cryptanalysis secret. What was the
outcome? Differential cryptanalysis was "discovered" and published by
scientists a few years later anyway. But the rumors that DES contained
a secret backdoor, which were the consequence of keeping the design
secret (though the algorithm itself was public!) could not be
dismissed. The net effect was that confidence in DES was damaged from
the start.

Nobody *but* the Clipper proponents have ever claimed that chips
*should be* tamper-proof, or even thought about the usefulness of this
concept. But if a system has to be kept secret to work, it needs a
tamper-proof chip, which is just another argument that this proposal
is impractical. On the other hand, if it doesn't have to be kept
secret to work, then publish it.

The problem with NSA is not that they wouldn't be dumb, but that they
still insist (or at least claim to) on the concept of security by
obscurity, while they should be smart enough to know that this concept
is the weakest of all. This damages their credibility, no matter how
smart they *really* are.

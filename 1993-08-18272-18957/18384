Can you say "checks and balance"?

As for discouraging people, I'm doing no such thing. People are free to
express their opinions all they like. What I'm saying is that it might only
make a difference if there's enough sentiment in Congress to either change
existing authorizations, or use a back door, such as a rider on a must-have
bill.

Filibustering is quite relevant, as those who know anything about how
Congress works understand. Another back door is to filibuster a must-have
bill until the Administration agrees to some rider which has nothing to do
with the bill.

It can also work in reverse. The most recent example was last week, when
some filbustered the flood relief bill because of a non-germane provision
for jobs in the inner cities (can you say "Los Angeles") put there as a
naked power play  by a California legislatrix. (as in "tricks"). In the
event, because of the political pressure to get the flood releif funds out,
they had to back down and permit the inner city rider.

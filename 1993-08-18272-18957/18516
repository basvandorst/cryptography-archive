If you want to take a provably long-period PRNG and feed it through a
strong encryption algorithm, the source PRNG itself doesn't need to be
strong.  You could use a simple counter, starting at some initial value
(considered part of the key).  The strength of the encryption algorithm
should be enough to totally hide the starting value of the counter, no
matter how many sequential values you use (unless it loops).

If you have enough bits of [initial-value,key] and if you choose those at
random (as your key) for each message, the chance of overlap should be very
small.  [This can be calculated and should be, for any given system.  You
should assume that if there is even one byte of overlap during the life of
the system, by all users of it, you've given something away to the enemy
and failed -- so the probability of one byte of overlap (or more) is the
probability of failure of this system.]

Does anyone know of studies of the strength of an algorithm like DES in
this mode -- encrypting a long sequence of incrementing 64-bit values?
At what point (if any) does the output stream start looking less than
perfectly random?

Sounds like a good idea, but why bother with the DES at all?  Right
now, the DES/crypt used in the password verification is being employed
as a one-way transform of the password.  Seems to me that MD5 should
be able to do this pretty well by itself.

Why not drop the MD5 digest into the "password file", which is created
from a digest computed over the password/passphrase the use types in
and some system-specific constant, like the host name.

[Of course, you have to modify all the various programs that look at the
"encrypted" password, like login, su, passwd, etc].

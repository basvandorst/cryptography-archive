I just happened to notice that "skipjack" is the brandname of
some canned Tuna. Could this be some inside joke by the NSA?

This means there is "significant risk" that DES has already been
broken by exhaustive search. At least in my simple mind, subtracting
36 from 30-40 means negative 6 to 4 years.

In other words, the commitee "approved" NSA's result.

Did the commitee replicate the testing?

A pretty strong conclusion. Many experts tend to cover themselves with
"we do not know of any", "no known ways", "none of the standard ways",
etc.

Clearly, the commitee is *CONVINCED*.

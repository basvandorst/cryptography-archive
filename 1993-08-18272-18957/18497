I am currently at work on textbook on network security (to be published
by Macmillan) and am in the market for homework problems to be added
to the book. The book will cover encryption, key management, secrecy,
authentication, digital signatures, intruders, viruses, trusted systems, etc..
Problems for all these areas are sought. A fee of $15 will be paid for each
original problem that is accompanied by a worked-out solution and that is
used in the book. The problem provider will be acknowledged in the book
and get a free copy of the book.

Please send any contributions directly to me via email. Thanks.

   FWIW, my local CongressCritter had a 'town hall' meeting last Tuesday;
   afterwards, I kinda gave him hell about Clipper/Skipjack and what the hell
   the government was doing trying to stomp hell out of my civil liberties,
   anyway?  After the obligatory tap-dancing, backing-and-filling, and
   waffling, he got my name and address and said he'd 'look into it'.

If you do that sort of thing, remember that the CONgress and the Presidency
and the Bureaucracy are three different things; rather than attacking
"The Government" as if they were all in league with each other,
you can position the question to your CongressCritter as
	"The NSA is doing <latest obnoxiousness>, and 
        can you Honorable Congresscritters make them behave?"

Rather than putting Congress and the NSA together and you opposed to them,
you can call the NSA the bad guys and the Congressman the good guy,
which is much more likely to get his cooperation, even if he's in
the same party as the President.  Take advantage of their separation!

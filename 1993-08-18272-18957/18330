From D. Dennings post of the Executive Summary on the Skipjack Review:

 the strength of SKIPJACK against a cryptanalytic attack does not
     depend on the secrecy of the algorithm.

Seems the security is dependent on the secrecy.  You or I would find it a
lot more secure if the algorithm were public:

							  Disclosure of
 the algorithm would permit the construction of devices that fail to
 properly implement the LEAF, while still interoperating with legitimate
 SKIPJACK devices.

Secure from the government that is.

The classification justification of the algorithm is given:

		Disclosure of the algorithm would permit analysis that
 could result in discovery of these classified design techniques, and
 this would be detrimental to national security.

Why not just shelve the whole idea.  You (the government) give up the idea
of spying on the citizenry, and I'll give up using your 'better' encryption
algorithm.  

One still wonders if the MYK-78 could be used in such a fashion as to
circumvent the transmission of the Law Enforcement Access Field in the hands
of the skillful programmer/system designer, based on the use of the cipher
context save/restore functions allowing the chip to be used for full duplex
communications.

   I doubt that for one reason.  The key escrow allows the Podunk PD to get
a court order and directly (with some as-yet-unspecified decryption box)
decrypt conversations of drug dealers (read "anyone they don't like").
Without the key escrow, all cryptext would have to be sent to NSA for
decryption, and considering they "probably" have better things to do,
they'd rather let others handle the job.
   That's not to say that NSA can't decrypt Skipjack without the key escrow
mechanism, just to say that at 10,000 (?) wiretaps per year and 100 (?)
conversations per wiretap, NSA would have one million more messages to
decrypt, adding considerably to what must be an already overwhelming
workload.

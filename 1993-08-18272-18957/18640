There seems to be a misunderstanding.

Firstly, in the UK (and quite possibly elsewhere), companies that do work 
in both commercial and governmental cryptography are required to maintain 
the strictest of segregation between the two divisions, with no spill over in 
either access or expertise.

Secondly, a variety of sensitive government sites are protected from 
peremptory search - let alone seizure -  even with a court order. The 
position in the UK may be unique as it results from our constitutional 
arrangements. A variety of Crown activity attracts considerable immunity from
action in the Queen's courts. Over the years, this immunity has been eroded but
is still sufficiently powerful to prevent any peremptory search and seizure 
in connection with a wide range of Crown interests - of which cryptography 
would certainly be one. Where there is a conflict of interest between the 
the administration of justice through the Queen's courts and other Crown 
interests, there are suitable procedures for its resolution and the system 
appears to work quite well. Those procedures do not include allowing 
peremptory entry, search and seizure in high security sites.

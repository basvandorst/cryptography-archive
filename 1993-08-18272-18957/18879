This is a secure one-time pad cipher which can be decrypted 
simply by looking at it. Key management is a problem, but
assuming the key sheets are truly random and not compromised 
or reused, the one-time pad is unbreakable.
 
A creates several key sheets. Each is a piece of paper containing a
random pixel image at around 100 dpi. A keeps a copy of the images
on her hard drive, encrypted with a pass phrase, and gives the 
printouts to B.
 
A creates her plaintext using a fairly large font, then rasterizes it
to produce a pixel image at the same resolution as the key sheets.
Then she XOR's the plaintext image with the key sheet image, prints
out the result as the ciphertext, and sends it to B. Fairly thin,
low-weight paper is used for both the key and ciphertext sheets, 
either with laser printers or fax machines. A then wipes the key 
sheet image off her hard drive; it will not be reused.
 
B lays the ciphertext sheet over the key sheet and holds it
up to a bright light. He will see the plaintext clearly visible 
in solid black, against a background of random static. Overlapping
the sheets performs a binary OR of the pixels.
 
Has this been done? Probably. It would be easiest to implement as
a Windows printer driver. Any practical uses for it? It's interesting
that you can make a secure cipher in which the decryption requires 
no computation.

Though it's nowhere near a Nobel in the scientific community, they have a
medal that's given out sparingly by the President. William Friedman got one.

I'm not sure if it's now given publicly without specification or is still
secret. There used to be a half-joke about visiting one's medals in a secure
facility.

In the U.K. they handle this issue rather better--there are many knighthoods
given out for "services to industry" etc.

Mostly, though, people who go to work for the NSA have rather different
motives than notoriety, I'd think.

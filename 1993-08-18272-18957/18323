This strikes the closest so far to the correct answer.  Copyrights
apply ONLY to the ornamental, NEVER to the utilitarian.  Since this
bit stream is REQUIRED for correct operation, it is by definition not
ornamental and hence not subject to copyright.

If, for example, only every other bit in the stream had to match, then
they could have obtained a copyright on the filler bits.  A clone
could have used the required bits, but would have had to come up with
their own filler bits.

This stuff all makes sense if you think in terms of what a copyright
really is.

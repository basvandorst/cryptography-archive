In the U.S. if a clever lawyer tried to get classified material that would
endanger the national security (such as a sensitive NSA algorithm) in this
way, it would likely fail. In extremis, the notion that "the Constitution is
not a suicide pact" would be invoked and a special national security law
passed to remedy any parallel loophole here. At least that's my speculation.

As for the U.K. case, since Britain is the land of such things as the
Official Secrets Act, It wouldn't surprise me if the anomaly you describe
above will be remedied by legislation, if it hasn't already.

Potential flamers should note that the above is an observation, not an
advocacy.

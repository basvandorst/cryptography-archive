I do not know whether "Without Prejudice UCC 1-207" makes any legal
difference to the use of the negotiable document. I will say this: your
comment on my post was singularly bereft of courtesy. I use the net in
order to have fun and communicate with other like-minded and
intelligent individuals. I do not use the net to be laughed at. If you
think that my actions probably accomplish little or nothing, then you
and I agree. It is neither necessary nor desirable to respond by
snidely laughing at someone in writing. In future please temper your
comments. 

Mike

  The phrasing presumes a "fact" not in evidence, namely, that law enforcement
-cannot- find alternative ways to do its job in a world of routine secure

(not that I accuse you of being a privacy opponent; this looks like a common
case of spitting out an implicit assumption without awareness or analysis).

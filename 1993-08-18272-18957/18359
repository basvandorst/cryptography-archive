Hello all,

Does anyone know of any published papers about the use of timestamps in
an open distributed processing environment. I have recently finished the
development of such a mechanism and would be interested in publishing some
of the results. I haven't come across much published material on this matter
except small paragraphs suggesting some possible approaches. I would
appreciate it if anyone out there could let me know if they have come across
any recently printed material on the use of timestamps for increasing a systems
security. Thanking you in advance.

Regards

Sean B. O'Connell

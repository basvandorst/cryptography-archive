I expect there were not 33 unique high quality systems in use.  

Is there any reference to what crypto these countries were using?  ie.;
if they were all using the same (Crypto Haglan possibly) it was less
diverse effort than if 33 different systems were used.  
Note that many nations used the Crypto Haglan well into the 50's  (and
some rumored into the late 60's).  It still gave privacy....

Can anyone post  / point to any more of the material released?

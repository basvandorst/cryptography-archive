In the absence of strong authentication, the IP labelling options are not
at all trustworthy.  Most users of IP have not bothered to deploy any such
authentication mechanisms.  The value of those options on the global Internet
is clearly questionable.  They might however be useful in non-global private
networks that happen to run TCP/IP and are "suitably" protected throughout
that private network space.  

So Srini's assertion is correct, if understated in its seriousness.
The solution space includes, labelling at the transport layer (clearly
highly desirable), adding real security mechanisms to the transport layer
if one labels there, adding real security mechanisms to IP if one continues
to label data there.

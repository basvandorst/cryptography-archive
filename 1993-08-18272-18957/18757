     True, but not particularly significant.  Obviously, building in a trapdoor
   would backfire if they got caught at it; however, I trust that I need not

It's more than just the escrow agencies, it's the whole escrow process.
The SkipJack algorithm can be as strong as they want, since the escrow
process provides the weaknesses; that's part of why they're doing all
this hoopla about the Interim Trust-Me Committee report.
Also, if SkipJack details *were* revealed to the public, they don't
have much downside risk - it's only 80-bit keys, weaker than triple-DES
or IDEA (unless there are trapdoors we don't yet know about),
so they're no worse off than if the public starts using strong crypto,
especially if they've got Clipper-nonsense built into the cellular
phone standards before SkipJack either gets hacked from the chips or 
revealed for political reasons to show we really *should* trust them...

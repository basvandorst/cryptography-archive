I may have misunderstood, but I thought that one of the real reasons
was to prevent foreigners or criminals  (or anyone else that NSA would
like to be able to tap) from getting their hands on an algorithm as
good as skipjack.  We don't want to advance the state of anyone else's
art, so to speak.  If this is really a factor, I'm not sure what it 
says about NSA's opinion of triple-DES, IDEA, or other schemes that 
are widely available and commonly thought to be "strong."

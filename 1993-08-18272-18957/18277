There was some discussion of Nintendo efforts to prevent unauthorized
video games from running in their video game players in the last few years
in Communications of the ACM.  As I recall, for a game to operate it had
to provide a particular bit stream from a state-machine-on-a-chip.  An
identical chip inside the Nintendo produced the same bit stream, and the
game player constantly compared the two bit streams to make sure they were
identical.  If not, the game wouldn't play.

Nintendo then COPYRIGHTED the bit stream.  Anyone who produced that bit
stream without Nintendo's permission was, they argued, violating their
copyright.

I don't believe this argument turned out to hold up in court.

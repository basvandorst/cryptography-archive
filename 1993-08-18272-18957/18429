Given the NSA's ship-wise trend of naming systems and algorithms
like 'clipper' and 'skipjack,'
I expect to see the following add-on algorithms in the next few years:

corvette: a faster, smaller version;
cruiser: a larger, table-driven version;
dhow: one specifically made to protect financial data;
xebec: export version;
brig: one that catches a lot of terrorists and pedophiles;
dingy: one distributed free to drug addicts, hoping they will use it;

and, finally, of course, the pinnacle of the series: the junk.

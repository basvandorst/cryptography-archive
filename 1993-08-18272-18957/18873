Hello,

I am hoping that someone on the net can help me with this since I have had
no success with the library or with the Belgium Consulate.

What are the export restrictions, if any, on crypto. technology from Belgium,
or Benelux?  Could one export a product from there that would be otherwise
banned from export from the US?

I appreciate any information you might provide.

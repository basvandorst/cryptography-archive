How about this for paranoia:
NSA senses the imminent disclosure of Skipjack and launches a
pre-emptive leak, but doesn't leak the real Skipjack algorithm. It
releases an extremely similar, but fatally flawed algorithm (1
critical S-box subtly changed) that has the at-large crypto
community fascinated and distracted. It hopes the real Skipjack
code will be lost in the soaring bandwidth....

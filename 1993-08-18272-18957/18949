There are several journal articles which describe zero-knowledge proofs
in detail.  The only popular-level exposition I've run across is
Zero-Knowledge Proofs, by Peter Wayner, in the November, 1987 issue of
Byte magazine, page 149.  I believe it has some references that will take
you into the larger literature if you like.

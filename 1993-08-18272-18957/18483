Bill Stewart attempts to poke holes in ITAR. Without commenting on the
validity of his observations, this discussion in one form or another has
been going on for quite some time, has little to do with the technical
aspects of sci.crypt, and has annoyed some.

It would seem to me that the best procedure for an individual would be
either to take legal advice and then act, or to take one's own advice, take
one's chances, and act, or to prefer prudence.

In no case will further argumentation here have any practical relevance to
decision or action.

Let's not start up again, but respect those who want to talk about
sci.crypt. I, for one, do not plan to comment about the substance of Bill's
or anyone else's "interpretations" of ITAR.

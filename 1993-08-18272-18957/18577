You might do exactly that if, as was the case, the government insisted
that the only possible standard was one that was implemented only in
hardware.  Hardware-only, as in DES, CCEP, and Clipper, is NSA's sacred
requirement.  That was true even before the proliferation of personal
computers.  It is even more important now.  Their greatest fear is
implementations of strong crypto in easily replicated software which
might turn any and every personal computer into a strong crypto engine.

You might also do it if, as was the case, you understood that absolute
key length is irrelevant.  What is relevant is the length of the key
relative to the length of the data encrypted under it.  The IBM
developers understood that computers enable you to change keys as often
as you like, even often enough that the length of the key is equal to
the length of the data.  

The periodic discussion of the length of the DES key has always amused
the IBM people who understand that the length of the effective DES key
is, as is also true of RSA, arbitrarily long.

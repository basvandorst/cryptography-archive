If I were the NSA, I wouldn't reduce the key space to a few million.
I'd reduce it to one.

I would:

1.	choose a top secret block encryption algorithm, cleared for highest
	level key encryption purposes

2.	encrypt the chip's serial number with that algorithm and use the
	result as the chip's key

3.	generate key a escrow pair to fit this key

4.	highly classify the whole key generation process, so that no enemy
	power could

	a.	duplicate the work, and thereby get a loyal American's keys

	b.	blow the whistle on me, exciting pinko liberals and
		interfering with the plan to convert the world to Skipjack

Good think I'm not the NSA, isn't it?  :-)

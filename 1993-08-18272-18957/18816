FWIW, my local CongressCritter had a 'town hall' meeting last Tuesday;
afterwards, I kinda gave him hell about Clipper/Skipjack and what the hell
the government was doing trying to stomp hell out of my civil liberties,
anyway?  After the obligatory tap-dancing, backing-and-filling, and
waffling, he got my name and address and said he'd 'look into it'.  If I
disappear from the net, would somebody please contact Amnesty
International on my behalf? ;-)

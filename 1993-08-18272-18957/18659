It wouldn't surprise me in the least to see some FCC 'regulation' coming
down the pike that requires use of Clipper for any encryption over ISDN,
or for any users of networked systems, etc.  That would still be
'voluntary' - one is not 'forced' to use escrowed encryption.  Only if
one wishes to participate in any ISDN based networks, or other things
that may be very cost-effective and fun/useful to come down the pike.

I still remain unconvinced that the US Government Adminsistration
isn't going to come up with some sort of 'gotcha' (a non-escrowed crypto
tax - Clipper/Capstone users granted special exemption?) to maintain a
fiction of 'strictly voluntary', while effectively forcing one to use
their wonderful idea for the protection, benefit, and safety of the

I've had 7 email requests in 18 hours for the details about the
Codebreakers book, so I'm posting rather than mailing.

Title:		Codebreakers
Subtitle:	The Inside Story of Bletchley Park
Editors:	FH Hinsley & Alan Stripp
Publisher:	Oxford University Press
Year:		1993
ISBN:		0-19-820327-6


There are 30 chapters and an appendix, each by a different author, all
of whom worked at BP in some capacity or other.  The chapters are split
into 5 sections: "The Production of Ultra Intelligence"; "Enigma";
"Fish"; "Field Ciphers and Tactical Codes"; "Japanese Codes".  The
Appendix is entitled "How the Bletchley Park buildings too shape"

I have only dipped into the book so far, but what I see looks
fascinating.  There are real technical details in there, and one or two
surprises.  For instance, I didn't know that Roy Jenkins, later
Chancellor of the Exchequer and now Lord Jenkins and Chancellor of
Oxford University, worked at BP.  I learnt of the book by hearing the
tail-end of a review broadcast on the local radio as I was riding home
the other day.  The review was very enthusiastic, and Blackwell's
bookshop in Oxford coould barely keep up with demand the follwing couple
of days.

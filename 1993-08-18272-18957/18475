From a series of answers to EFF questions, the Administration representative
J. D. Podesta, Assitant to the President and Staff Secretary, provided the
following response:

> Because these measures may be
> sufficient to make key escrow encryption the easiest and most available
> privacy protection it would be imprudent to pursue the far more drastic 
> step of regulating private encryption.
 
> The Administration has progressed
> far enough in its review to conclude it will not propose new legislation to
> limit use of encryption technology.

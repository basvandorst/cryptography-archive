Could you say a bit more about why?  I would have thought that

* with a plain text of all zeros, it would take about 2^32 blocks to
cycle.

* with real plain text, cycling simply wouldn't show up because the
plain text has an effect on the cypher machine state.

* it would be no problem to XOR the plain text against each of the
previous *two* cypher text blocks, making loops much longer and
effectively remedying the problem.

*Really*?   ..."successful active attacks on_every_cryptosystem."
I believe this is a truly religious(hole-y) statement.

1) Please define "successful".

2) How about "_every_cryptosystem".

3) Can one "active(ly) attack" a system they know nothing about? Hmm...
maybe that Psychic 900 number?

***Would you care to wager (In the "Sternlight challenge" tradition) a
dinner in Scottsdale/Berkley, or print a retraction?***

References support "...success on some systems some of the time....",
likely closer to reality. (One is Bob Woodward, Veil, New York, Simon and
Schuster, 1987.) "Of the 20 principal targeted countries, well, in
summary it was possible to break some of the codes some of the time, but
not all of the codes all of the time." (Admiral Stansfield) Turner said.
(Ex DCI)

Just because the cryptosystem is or isn't know by everyone on sci.crypt,
or published in open literature or not, doesn't make it good or bad.  
There are very good systems, algorithms and implementations that are not
published, and likely you will not hear about on sci.crypt.  (And
published algorithms that may be "religious" you have heard about.)

Look at the "man-in-the-middle attack" discussion.  There is a very
effective solution to the problem.  The sci.crypt dialogue tends to
indicate otherwise.   That doesn't mean someone will publish their
proprietary solution to satisfy an academic curosity.  It does predict
failure if the attacker doesn't understand the problem.  

I'd like my steak medium well.

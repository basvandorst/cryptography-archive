The use of crypto over government controlled communications media (eg.,
Amateur Radio) has often been prohibited.  The same goes to crypto over the
phone lines in some foreign countries today.

As far as I know there has never been an attempt to keep a citizen from
using crypto on paper, in letters for example, unless censorship applied
for other reasons (time of war, for exdample).  In today's age, this would
apply to cyrpto for file encryption, even if that file is sent on a floppy
in the mail.  The key registration proposal however, is trying to attack
just that -- not merely what goes over phone lines.  They want registered
key Skipjack ships in everybody's computer.

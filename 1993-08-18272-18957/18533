My guess is that it has to do with key length.  The NSA made sure that the
key length for DES was only 56 bits.  Otherwise, DES appears to be a very
strong algotighm.

Skipjack may be an even stronger algorithm, but with a short key
length (only 80 bits), it is probably not suitable for classified information.
Skipjack with a longer key may very well be suitable for classified info.

The NSA seems to want public crypto to have as short a key length as it
can get they can get away with.  56 bits was considered too short in 1980,
though it has proven long enough to last until today.
And 80 bits is considered too short for today, and is probably a lower limit on
useful key length.  Secure enough, but no more!

Greetings:

I am writing a book on Macintosh security for Peachpit Press,
scheduled to be published sometime in February or March of 1993. 
The book is written to the average (non-technical) user, and will
cover passwords, encryption, virus protection, backups, physical
security, disaster recovery, and network security.

I am looking for three things:

     1.  Anyone with interesting products, insights, ideas,
     stories, etc. for inclusion in the book.

     2.  Anyone who is willing to read and edit a copy of the
     manuscript.

     3.  Anyone who can think of a better title than "Protect
     Your Macintosh," which is what the publisher likes.  ("The
     Mac Paranoia Book" is a little better, but only a little.)

Thanks,

Bruce

The cryptanalytic technique of auto-correlation is described in most
introductory text books on cryptography. The attack is useful for determining
the length of the key in simple cipher systems, such as the Vigenere cipher,
among others.

The technique involves shifting intercepted ciphertext by an amount (delta) say
and counting the correlations. So for example, given ciphertext

	abczzxxbcdab

a shift of 1 would give

	abczzxxbcdab
	 abczzxxbcdab

two correlation (z=z, x=x). In practice a great number of different delta are
used and inferences are made based on the size of the correlation.

Recently it occurred to me that this attack could be extended (whether or not
it would be useful for current systems I don't know---this is not my research
interest). What I propose is the use of fractional shifts. Forgive me if this
idea has already been suggested in the pass. I haven't the time to check in the
library. Possible this might be useful for ciphers which attempt to diffuse
information across ciphertext letters.

For simplicity, assume we are using a binary alphabet. Let the shift be delta.
For example delta might be something like 1.5. The auto_correlation then becomes a
weighted sum of the matches with shift 1 and shift 2. (In the case of 1.5 this
weighting is 50% for shift 1 and 50% for shift 2). In the case of delta=1.3 it
would be 70% for shift 1 and 30% for shift 2).

Example:
		0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0
		   0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0	(shift 1.5)

correlation is 10/2 = 5.

Of course you have to normalize these correlation to the length etc...

Does this seem like it might be a useful idea? Is it a waste of time? Please
send any opinions to

If there is sufficient interest I'll post a summary of responses.

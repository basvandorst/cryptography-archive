A friend of mine who is a software reviewer has just received a 
copy of a Russian encryption package called 'EXCELLENCE for DOS'.  
The originators are: 

   Elias Ltd,  tel +7095 903 2147,  fax +7095 903 0266.

The UK agents are ENGRUS of Cambridge,  tel +223 248916, contact: 
Vladimir Freiden.

The package claims to implement GOST 28147-87, the Soviet State 
Standard for Encryption as well as using RSA for Public Key 
functions.

Does anyone know whether these claims are reasonable? - and if so 
how strong is the cipher system?

Regards,

Keith Lockstone.

I was just about to wimp out on this bet, claiming that I was
speaking metaphorically, when it occurred to me that even if I
lose *this* bet, I could still win by verifying that you do (or
do not) exist.

So how about this: On 1 August 1994, if there has been no credible
USENET posting of the Skipjack algorithm, I will buy you dinner the
next time you come to Portland, Oregon.  (I'm not going to bet the
cost of transportation, either.)  But if it has been posted, then
you can buy me dinner the next time I go to Los Angeles/Pasadena.
Either way, if I see you, then I can reassure everyone who believes
in me that you are real.

The chip's physical and electronic safeguards, of course, are com-
pletely irrelevant to the discussion, since I believe that the
algorithm will become known through either bribery or extortion.

NSA's intelligence folks don't talk to police departments. Their results
go to just a few people in Washington. When NSA can decrypt a piece of
text, even the _fact that they can do so_ is automatically classified 
and is rarely revealed to anyone without appropriate clearance. (Sample
exception: in justifying his attack on Libya, Reagan disclosed the fact
that NSA had decoded certain Libyan communications.)

Think of the national intelligence services as personal playthings of 
the President and you won't be far wrong.

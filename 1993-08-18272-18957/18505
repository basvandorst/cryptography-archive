According to the FAQ, the attributes of strong cryptography include
that of such algorithms producing output that is unable to be
distinguished from random data (the meaning of "unable" being directly
porportional to that of "strong"). That being said, one can feed
merely pseudo-random trash into a strong cryptographic algorithm
and obtain one-time-pad data. So sayeth the FAQ. What the FAQ doesn't
talk about is the possibility of continuing this.

By definition, strong cryptography makes output from which one cannot
determine the input. Is not the corolary to all this that one cannot
predict the output of strong cryptography from a given input (obviously
one can run the data through the encryption, but that isn't "predicting")?

If that's true, then cannot one create a sort of one-time-pad engine
which takes a small pseudo-random input, runs it through DES,
then takes the output and feeds that back in as input, thus generating
a perpetual stream of one-time pad data? Is it not possible to
syncronize two such generators at the start and get a strong
one-time-pad system this way?

The following article on Unix Password cracking was forwarded to cypherpunks.
It's also a respectably fast DES-cracker.  Each crypt() does 25 modified DES steps,
so this is 160 million DES/sec, or about 2**27/sec, 2**43/day. 
That's an average 2**11 days for a brute-force DES crack.

> Roch Bourbonnais, a Thinking Machines Corporation engineer, has ported
> and optimized the CM/2 port of the UFC-crypt to a CM/5 system.
> The UFC-crypt (Ultra Fast Crypt) implementation on the CM/2 Connection
> Machine (parallel computer) is a UNIX password checking routine (crypt())
> ported by Michael Glad at UNI-C.

> The port, that is written in CM-fortran, utilizes the CM/5 vector units
> and is partly programmed in cdpeac (vector unit assembly language).

> The package achieves 1560 encryptions/second/vector unit. This scales to
>     6,4 million encryptions per second on a large  1024 node machine.
>     800,000          -       -     -    - - small   128  -      -
> With this impressive performance, all combinations of 6 letters can be
> tried in less than an hour and all combinations of 6 lower-case letters
> can be tried in less than one minute.

> Congratulations,

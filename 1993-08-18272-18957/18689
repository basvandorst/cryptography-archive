I'm new to this group so I'd don't know if this has been picked over
or not, anyway...

	Just because some of research was covered previously
by government funding does not limit patent rights.  The idea is that
what specifically being patented was not funded by public funds (however,
I don't know the extent, I'm sure it's a gray area in law too).
Quite frankly, I think it is better a private company has the patent
on it since then you know it will be lincensed.  If the gov. had it
they could squash it. (?)

	Wrong.  The patent isn't covering encryption in electronic mail, but
a specific form of encryption that can be used in e-mail.

	No.  What difference does it make? I'm sure every government in
world is interested.  All that matters is YOUR work, and not who's 
interested.

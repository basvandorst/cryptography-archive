Chaum's stuff is great (read his paper in the very first issue of
"Journal of Cryptology"), but a small panel of 5 has some very easy
options for anonymous voting: "yes" or "no" written on ballots in a hat
passed around the table. Or "blackballing."

If the vote is in favor of Cliphack, it's not just because each of the
five panel members were intimidated by the government.

(Though a true paranoid might claim they were too frightened to even
_consider_ an anonymous vote... Hmhhh....)

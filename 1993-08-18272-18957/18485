   Hmmm.  Keep in mind that the NSA has a *lot* to gain by making sure
Clipper has no weaknesses except the (gaping hole) escrow agencies.
If such a weakness were shown, the cause of government-controlled crypto
in the US would suffer a major blow--especially if it appeared that NSA
had built in the weakness.  (Similar arguments apply to the Skipjack
algorithm itself--if it is broken anytime soon, NSA's plans to get people
to use government-approved, escrowed cryptosystems will be badly hurt.)
 
   I suspect that we'll see some interesting scandals and cover-ups when
it comes out that the key-escrow agencies have been corrupted and someone
somewhere has acquired some keys from them.  I wouldn't be at all
surprised to see people get killed to keep that sort of story from leaking
out--the FBI/NSA/US Gov't will have a *lot* to lose....  (Sorry, this
is political rambling....)

   I'm more concerned with the small number of academic cryptologers who
were allowed to review the algorithm.  It's conceivable that all five of
them could have been bribed or threatened into giving an "everything's
okay" statement.  I don't think this is likely, but I'd like to see more
people involved.  I'd also like to see (although it might never make the
press) those involved having the chance to cast a simple and untraceable
"up" or "down" vote, a la Chaum's dining cryptographers.  Finally, maybe
a face-to-face meeting with the President, promise of anonymity in exchange
for complete honesty to him about what's going on.

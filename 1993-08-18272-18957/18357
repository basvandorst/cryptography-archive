Well, sure.

But you also said that you were placing it into the public domain as per
an ITAR exemption. ITAR does not appear to allow this. Something is in 
the public domain for the purposes of ITAR, or it is not; the only way 
to change its status is, apparently, to do something which violates the
ITAR. The fact that you said you were changing its status indicates a 
misunderstanding of the ITAR on your part.

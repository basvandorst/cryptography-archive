	There are several things involved here, but I don't think
	that any of them were particularly cryptographic in nature.

	The Iraqis learned fairly quickly that industrious emitters
	were bomb magnets and kept communications to a minimum, any
	major communications nodes were moved around frequently.
	(As an aside, I'm told that the gateway for Net traffic was one
	of the first targets to go.)

	Front line units were frequently equipped with Soviet-style
	"receive only" radios. Even so, the Allies prowess in electronic
	warfare had them in so much awe that they were unwilling to
	turn even these on.

	The Iraqis had a fiber optic network.  The trenches were detected
	by JSTARS aircraft and bombed.

	The problem with troop numbers arose from commanders not
	telling their superiors about deserters.  If you hear a callsign
	for Company A of the First Battalion of Mechanized Cannon Fodder,
	you assume that a full-strength company is in the area of the
	emitter.  Unless the report actually states that due to desertions,
	anti-social diseases and self-inflicted wounds the company has
	an active strength of four, you are extremely unwise to assume
	that it is under strength.

	It all sounds like the Iraqis demonstrated good communications
	by accident rather than by design.

	Alec.

Summary: Owning a protocol using copyright law.
Keywords: protocol intellectual property patents copyright law

My reply to various correspondents:

# I don't mean to nit-pick, but aren't copyright laws meant to protect
# the artistic and/or creative values of a published piece of work,
# not a protocol of data communicaton?  Your idea might not stand in a court.

The copyright mechanism isn't being invoked against the protocol. It's
being invoked against the opponent's software. As I understand it,
copyright law allows the prevention of the copying of a document for
any reason. The only exception I know of is the "fair dealing" clause
which allows academics to quote people without reaching for their
Visacard.

I don't know if it would stand up in court, but I find it hard to see
why it wouldn't - the alledged infringer is distributing copies of the
copyright document. It's a simple as that.


# Regardless of what the artistic/creative value of the original document
# is, using it as a part of a protocol might not be considered equivalent
# of (re)_publishing_ it.  Perhaps the author of the "cracker" program
# has encrypted the document so that the user of the program never gets
# to see the cleartext.  I can't see how this could infringe any law about
# publishing anything.

I can see your point, but I suspect that, in law, the key issue is
whether copying has taken place. Remember that the transmission of the
digest in the protocol exists solely to prove the existence of
information in the opponent's software. Thus, the case rests not on
copyright infringement by the transmission of information down the
comms line, but on the inclusion of the information in the opponent's
software which is being copied and distributed.


# And even if all clones were declared illegal - who would want to buy a
# product that was guaranteed _not_ to have a second source, ever?
# Usually buyers want second sources, or at least options for them.

Separate issue. But, I can imagine many situations where a
manufacturer would want a protocol to remain private. Certain dinosaur
computer companies live on this stuff. Another example is the maker of
a word processor could prevent the opposition from writing filters to
convert documents in the word processor to the format of the
opposition. It's sick, I know, but it's plausible. :-)

(I was not aware of the Nintendo mechanism).

# The problem with the copyright of the bitstream might simply have been

Well, exactly. As I mentioned in my original post, the string could be
THE COMPUTER PROGRAM ITSELF (call it Q). Thus, the opposition, in
order to converse with Q has to include Q in some form in it's
executable. Now if that's not copyright violation, I'll eat a printout
of Solaris.

The point is that my digest scheme means that the document can be as
long and as important as you like and yet its size will not impact on
the protocol. I suspect that the Nintendo string was fairly short.
They were probably trying to conserve ROM space too.

Of course with public key technology Nintendo could have zipped it all
up locktight (e.g. by programming the main unit not to play cartridges
that aren't signed with Nintendo's private key. (Gosh, if they did
that, that key would be one hell of an commercial secret! :-))

Thanks for your comments guys,


Ross.

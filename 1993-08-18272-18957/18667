That is why it is important that the key management be automated.  In
the IBM/SNA system, each device has a device key that is used only
for distribution of keys generated within the protected crypto
engine.  It is not possible to get anything else encrypted under 
this key.

I forget how Henry Beker proposed to manage keys, but
I understand the problems and I was convinced at the time I heard 
the proposal.  Perhaps someone else can help with this.  In the
Telequip case, the crypto engine modulates the key with the traffic.

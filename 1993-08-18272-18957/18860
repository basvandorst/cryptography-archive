oops! The qualifications of p = 1 (mod 4) and q = 3 (mod 4) would
prevent A from switching the two. It seems sound to me now! You just
have to make sure A has a good random source to prevent B from
duplicating A's original generation of the primes.

Don't be surprized if you have thought up a simpler way than the
published ones. That is the nature of progress.

A while back I was trying to think of a good, relatively simple but
unbreakable encryption method.  I'm wondering if anything similar to it
has ever been written.

Its rather simple.  The data is cast into a 3rd dimensional construct,
with the shape determined by the bits in the password.  Then it's simply
manipulated by doing bit insertion, and expanding the rows in one of the
3 directions.  The password encodes where to place the bits, and in what
direction to do the expansion.  You could even do axial rotations of
certain planes within the cube.

The advantage is that when the bit stream is written out, it's linear.
There's absolutely no way (without the password), of knowing what the 3
dimensional construct looked like, since the shape is implicit in the
pasword, not the data.

Interested to know,
  John

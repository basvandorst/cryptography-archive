Both Phil and Mike have missed the main point on this one.
"Good Security" let it be communications or other wise in
NOT a measure of how good you equipment is.

That is like saying that the ny Mets are a good team because
they have bats that can hit the ball 20' farther than any
other team in baseball.  Good equipment and Algorethms is
the job of academics and R&D people not military's, and they
have little to do with good security.

"Good Security" is the plan, the proceedure, and the
execution of those plans and proceedures.  Thats what the
original article was refering to not DES of any other comsec
equipment. 

By the way I do know what kind of communications equipment
the Iraqis had during the gulf war and I can tell you this
much: 
Your both wrong.

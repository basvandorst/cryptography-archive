I seem to remember that the NSA's spokesman, Walter Deeley, said
he "wouldn't bet a plugged nickel on DES being safe." This was back
in circa 1987 when the NSA tried to offer their first round of sealed crypto
chips to the world. There was no key escrow back then (at least publically
disclosed). The algorithms, though, were still classified.

The quote was from, if I remember correctly, an article in _Science_
magazine about the chips.

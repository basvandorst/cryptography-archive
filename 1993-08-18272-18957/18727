This is exactly one of the points I was trying to make.  I furthermore
point out that the presence of the escrow system really doesn't satisfy
its stated justification as it is trivial to defeat.  And the only people
who would not do this are those who are on the same "side" as the law
enforcement agencies.

Or organized crime, or a whole host of other activities that would use
encrypted communication systems.  Most of these "threats" would trivially
have the capacity to use additional encryption that would make useless any
advantage provided by the escrow system.  Thus, the escrow system is no
good against those at which it is directed.

(and is a BIG weakness with respect to legitimate needs users)

Again, true, but since any hostile sophisticated enough to employ skipjack
systems can reasonably be expected to be aware of this weakness, those
hostiles could then be reasonably be expected to take further measures
rendering the advantages gained by the escrow system moot.

Even if it's just using a 1950's vintage analog scramble phone.

Or using some other means of encrypted communication.

So, anyone law enforcement would be interested in would not be accessable
by simply using the escrow system.  While legitimate users have their
security dependant on the security of the escrow system, however good that
may be (and it can't be too good otherwise it won't provide the necessary
speed of response to satisfy the justification regarding law enforcement)
it renders the entire security of a huge part of the US government, and
the US enconomy vulnerable to concentrated attack on a single site.

This sounds bad to me.

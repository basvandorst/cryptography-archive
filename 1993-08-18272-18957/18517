Publish it in a newspaper; send it by mail; send it by fax or e-mail; hand 
deliver it; send it by heliograph; place it with a public key server; 
broadcast it over the BBC... the list is endless. Some means are more 
appropriate than than others but, no doubt, you can sort out the methods 
which suit you best.

Where's the catch? Oh yes....you need to devise an a means whereby a key 
recipient can be assured that the key received is identical with the key 
sent. Key signatures and short identifying hashes that can be read over the 
phone (both covered in the literature) help a great deal. Again, you need to 
finetune a system to suit your needs.

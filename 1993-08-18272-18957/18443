You can get an export license for something that contains DES. It is
considered on a case-by-case basis. Devices that can only decrypt usually
sail right through. They block stuff that can both encrypt and decrypt.

Most attacks on video scrambling systems go after the key
distribution/authorization process. Whenever a break occurs, everyone has
to have their convertor upgraded. This is one of the reasons that satcom
users hate the company that supplies the encryption hardware.

You should perhaps have a closer look at a Crypto Controller made
by Philips called the P83C852. It has an on-chip accelerator for fast
enciphering using the RSA algorithm. Philips sells a demo kit with this
controller called: 
	OM4280 - P83C852 Smart Card cryptocontroller demonstration kit.

The demo kit is supplied with:
	- An operating manual
	- A full description of the card operating system
	- Two Smart Cards each with a P83C852 CMOS crypto controller
	- A card reader
	- A PC interface cable
	- A mains adaptor
	- Diskettes with the Smart Card demo software and source
	  code for an RS-232 interface to a PC's serial port.

There are also other Smart Cards from GEMPLUS Card International that
come with on-chip RSA or DES.

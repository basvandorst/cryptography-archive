Educated guesses put the "black" budget of the NSA at around +/- $10
billion per annum. Of course, their budget is strictly classified, so
its anybody's guess. One would think that with the demise of the "cold
war," this amount of intensive intelligence would decrease, however,
it appears that this is not the case.
 
So where is this amount of intelligence being redirected? Most folks
surmise that it is being redirected towards "industrial espionage" and
the likes, but I'd wager that an alarmimg amount of it is being
distributed into domestic surveillance, and in fact may be
intensifying on the global internet.
 
Case history:
 
First, the FBI decides that technology is just advancing too damned
fast for its liking. So it introduces the Digital Telephony Bill
(DT) (which, by the way, failed miserably) in order to force
telecommunications providers to allow law enforcement a secure
eavesdropping interface into whatever communications they deem
necessary.  The wording of this bill would have made the scope of the
law extremely vague, so in fact, it could have theoretically applied
to private BBS systems and other private networks.
 
Secondly, (and since the failure of the Digital Telephony Bill), NIST
was appointed as the implementor of the "key-escrow" agenda.
Personally, I see this as a direct follow-up to DT, since it really
surplants the need for real-time access to -all- communications.
 
Think about it.
 
Key-escrow may come to fruition without our support or input, but as
long as it doesn't outlaw the use of other methods of strong crypto
in the hands of the private masses, who cares?

Time? If I remember correctly, it took Cliff Stoll countless phone
calls and about 18 months to get any results whatsoever!
 
If you want privacy, personal empowerment and the right to encrypt as
you see fit, support the idealisms that go hand-in-hand with private
encryption.
 
No can guarantee your privacy except you, and even then you must take
precautions to ensure it.

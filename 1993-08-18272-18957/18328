I'm looking for information on a device I think
is called a KY-28, used for encryption of military
radio voice communications.  Anybody know anything
about them?
Specifically:

   -  How do they work?
   -  Are they still in use?  (When were they first
          used and for how long?)
   -  What were the physical security procedures?
   -  Who owned them (i.e. the individual services,
          NSA, ...)?

Jim

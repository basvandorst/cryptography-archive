Actually, I think one good answer would be Calling Line ID services provided
by the phone company (have they actually got round to allowing this?  I've
not been paying much attention I'm afraid).  The card company simply checks
the calling phone number against a customer supplied list of valid numbers.
It would mean the customer wouldn't be able to order from a payphone, but I
can't see that that would be much disadvantage.

At the beginning of the month, the following CFV was posted to the
net:

I have no problem with the concept of the newsgroup, but I do have a
big problem with the name.  It has been a tradition on the net to
borrow from a pre-existing namespace component when proposing new
newsgroups on a similar subject.  Supposedly, there are advantages to
this from a news administration perspective, but I'm not overly
knowledgable as to the particulars of this.

In short, this newsgroup should have been called talk.politics.crypt
and not talk.politics.crypto.  I somehow find it hard to believe that
30[-plus] days of discussion went by on this newsgroup proposal and no
one figured this out or pointed this out.  But then again, looking at
the propensity of people in news.groups to carry on flame wars ad
infinitum and ignore most proposals which come along, perhaps I should 
believe it.  As for myself, I would have been happy to point this out 
during the discussion period, except for the fact that my time for the 
net has been extremely limited these past two months and I likely had 
more important things to do.  But it's best that I bring this to the
net's attention before the whole thing is over with, rather than bring
it up after the results have been posted to the net.

I voted NO on this proposal several days ago for this very reason.  I
would urge anyone reading this to do the same, even if you may have
voted otherwise previously.  It is better to wait six months and have
a more proper name, than to have the newsgroup now and establish Yet
Another Bad Precedent on the net in the process.

These are the voting instructions which came with the CFV.  As of this
writing, there is slightly more than a week remaining in this vote,
and I would urge you to do something before it's too late.

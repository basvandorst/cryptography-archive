G'Day

A while back we were given a seminar by an AI expert (darned if I haven't
completely forgotten his name) about how they were using neural nets to
decypher messages. The basic premise was that the net was trained on words
from a dictionary which were encrypted (he was real hazy about the encryption
technique and wouldn't be drawn out during questioning). Anyways, he gave
us a live demo and, unlike physics experiments, it actually worked!! Now I
am guessing that all cracking techniques are based on the assumption that
the data is composed of words from one or more dictionaries. So it occured 
to me that one way to slow down the cracking process is to randomly inject
random words of random length within the text to be encrypted. This means 
even if you send exactly the same message N times you get N messages of 
differing length and content. Ofcourse after decryption a human can easily 
figure what is garbage and what makes sense. I can only guess that this would 
improve the encryption of messages enourmously. Its also pretty safe since 
the recognition part alone is one of the fundamental unsolved problems of 
AI. So, what do you folks think ? Randomiser + Simple encrypter = means
for safe message passing ? P.S. If this idea is a good one consider it
copyrighted, otherwise what the heck :-)

I would appreciate you not taking my comments out of context, as you
have consistently throughout this thread.  Just because BerkeleyThink
is pervasive in your neck of the woods doesn't mean that it means
anything in mine.

I was referring to the fact that this is not the first time this month
that I have encoutered a newsgroup proponent who fanatically carried
on with a "my way is best" attitude towards dissenters.  If one person
wants to say "my way is best" and gamble on having the requisite
support, then everyone will take that attitude about their favorite
newsgroup idea.  And then the whole newsgroup creation process becomes
"every man for himself."

>Weren't you aware of the talk.politics.crypto request for discussion?

I think I saw the original RFD when catching up on some stuff one day. 
But that's irrelevant.  I have an active life away from the net.  When
I do get on the net, it is usually over a 2400 bps dialup connection
to a packet-switched network.  As such, things go by very slowly and I
have to prioritize my activities.  Based on this particular thread,
the notion of carrying on a protracted discussion with a concrete wall
would not have seemed very enticing.  And it would have likely gone 
far beyond any amount of time available on my part.

Too late to change anything?  The voting period hasn't ended yet.  As
such, there's nothing to change.

If any fanatic were to believe that their pet newsgroup idea must
exist or the entire net will fall apart, then there would be no reason
to have a newsgroup creation process.  I'd like to believe that you
have more respect for the net.

Reality check: The tradition of the net calls for using exact
namespace components for newsgroups with similar themes.  If I were to
propose a newsgroup for discussing e-mail packages for the Macintosh,
call the newsgroup comp.sys.macintosh.e-mail, and then tell everyone
who informs me that it should be called comp.sys.mac.mail to get
stuffed because my way is best and the entire net will fall apart if
this newsgroup doesn't come into existence, how successful do you
think I would be with that proposal?  It's the exact same thing here.

I just checked, and it appears that sci.crypt receives no more than
about 20 articles per day.  Just how hard is it to ignore the
inappropriate traffic on even the worst newsreader?

>If Sean truly supported talk.politics.crypt/crypto, he would have

See above about my life and my ability to access the net.  Just 
because the people who spend half their lives on news.groups were too 
busy carrying on flame wars about Ahmadiyya Islam and/or Kibo hunting 
during the discussion period to even notice what was wrong with your 
proposal doesn't necessarily mean that it has any merit.

>Either we get talk.politics.crypto or we don't get any group until 1994.

The supposed checks and balances which exist in the newsgroup creation
process (and occasionally actually work) are there to stave off those
who believe it terribly important to have their newsgroup now.  We'll
see.

I beg your pardon, but this is not petty.  This is all about working
with the Usenet community, and respecting the traditions and
conventions of the net.  That is one of the more important things
about why Usenet has worked.

So what you are saying is, the real need of this newsgroup is only
temporary?  I think that's an even more compelling reason to vote NO
on this newsgroup than the one I originally presented.  Newsgroups are
generally intended to be perpetual.

Depends.  If you believe that "more and more newsgroups shoved down
people's throats at an alarming rate, without respect for tradition or
convention" is the way that the newsgroup creation process should go,
then it's not worth arguing about.  I have a lot more respect for
tradition and convention, however.

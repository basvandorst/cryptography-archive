The commision had the opportunity to attempt to gain some credibility
for itself by confining it's activities to a technical evaluation of
the scheme - are there backdoors; can escrow be compromised; etc.

Unfortunately, they lost all credibility when their first interim 
report went beyond technical evaluation into politics (expressing 
support for, and accepting the "given" nature of, law enforcement 
access).

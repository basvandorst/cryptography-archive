I am working on a serial.device driver for the Amiga Computer.  What it
does it take ANY ASCII data passing through the serial device and encrypts
it.  The reciever would have the same serial.device and would have to have
the same password file to read the data. I was planning on using either
IDEA or the DES algorithm, as I can get very decent speed from both
algorithm's running on an Amiga 3000 (Motorla 68030) or Amiga 4000 (Motorola
68040).  What I wanted to know is should I encrypt each character as it
passed through the serial device, or would it be better to buffer the
output and encrpyt all the buffered data every 5 seconds or so?..

Can a single character be encrypted successfully?  I tried with the IDEA
algorithm to encrypt the letter h, and the ciphertext was 12 bytes!

Any help would be appreciated!

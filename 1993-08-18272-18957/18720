If you have some known plaintext, it is possible to obtain a DES key
with some 2^55 or so encryptions.  This is within the capabilities of
the NSA.  Note the "known plaintext".

He said RSA/DES; that means that you probably haven't got any known
plaintext, so the exhaustive attack won't work.  Even if you do have
known plaintext it won't do you any good because the next message
will not use the same key.

Triple DES is much harder, and exhaustive search is not within the
reach of the NSA.

OK; the above contained no attacks whatsoever, and was substantive.  

Triple DES has been thoroughly analyzed, _in public_, and not found
to be wanting.  Skipjack hasn't had this exposure, so we don't know
anything at all about it.  It may be the best cipher ever invented.
Or not.

There's a saying: a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.  We
haven't got Skipjack, but we have got DES, RSA, and IDEA.  Until
Skipjack has been publicly examined we still won't have it.

Andrew.

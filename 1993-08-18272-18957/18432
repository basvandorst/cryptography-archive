   Does this mean that they can't record the data during the time they're 
requesting the warrant electronically, i.e. that the user would have, say,
ten minutes to talk before his communication could be compromised by
legal wiretap?  I would have the impression that they'd be able to record
the encrypted data, since it would be essentially meaningless without the
warrant, and then upon getting the warrant would be able to go back and
decrypt it.  Recording data encrypted by a "secure" system would otherwise
be an essentially useless exercise, which the Gov't (which usually gets its
way) could probably prove to be nonintrusive because, though they recorded
something, it was useless data without the LEAF.
   Wonder if this is something for one of the .legal groups?  (Which I'm
not getting, BTW; I'm on a limited feed until mo' money starts coming in.)

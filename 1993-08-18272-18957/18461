Hello,

I'm a PhD student working in the security of distributed multimedia
interactive applications.

I would appreciate any pointers or references that you could give 
me. My main interest is in access control policies and mechanisms.

I would also like to enter in contact with other people working in
this (or other) field(s) of distributed multimedia security.

I will later post a summary of the answers.

Please respons to my e-mail:

	kahan@irisa.fr

Thank you in advance.

Jose

Over the years I have been having this debate with various
"experts:"

Given a run of ciphertext such as for example DES under ciphertext
feedback, does there exist a test or sequence of tests that can identify
the example system from data generated by random draws?  Some experts say
no, there is no such test because it there was then it could be used to
get inside the system. Another group of experts say differently, that such
tests usually exist. They are specific and developed against a knowledge
of the system. 

I do not know who is right. Is anyone in a position to say beyond
speculation which group of "experts" has it right?

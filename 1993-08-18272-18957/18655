Murray's gratitously inflammatory phrasing fails to conceal that one of us
misunderstands the other.
       
As I've said many times, I believe that absent the key escrow, Skipjack is a 
very secure system--so secure that foreign organizations with NSA's
capabilities can't break it. Very likely neither can NSA or they wouldn't   
need the escrow. (I don't accept what I consider to be the paranoid point   
some make that the escrow is a cover to misdirect us from built-in
weakness.)                                                                     
                                       
Given that, the NSA would not like the bad guys to get Skipjack, whether in 
hardware or software, since they would then be able to use a non-escrowed   
version to foil the NSA.         
                                 
I have made this point repeatedly, and after seemingly agreeing with it,
Murray then misdirects us by suggesting his point is different from the
above, and that Denning and I are somehow spouting "nonsense."

It would be helpful if we could have a straight discussion here, absent
"chip-on-the-shoulder" messages.

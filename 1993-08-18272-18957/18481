You can get a copy of RSAREF which includes a copy of a kit (including
not one line of GNU code) to use any GMP-compatible library for the
multiple precision calculations in RSAREF. This kit will work with either
my public domain package FGMP (1.0b1) or the GNU GMP library. Neither
of these packages is included.

THIS IS EXPORT CONTROLLED AND AVAILABLE ONLY TO U.S. AND CANADIAN PERSIONS
LOCATED IN THE U.S. OR CANADA. 

anonymous ftp to 
wimsey.bc.ca
cd /pub/crypto/rsaref

read the file README 
(the distribution scheme is similar to that on ftp.tis.com and rsa.com
for export controlled software)

I urge you to comply with all applicable licence agreements and laws
concerning distribution of this material.

I have personal email from two people at the FSF which indicates
that this is now "legal" within the GPL, because I have released
FGMP.

I have tested this with both RIPEM and TIS/PEM. If you have any
bugs to report, please send me email and I'll do what I can.
I'm hoping that these will be useful in a number of free
RSAREF based programs.

Like everybody else in the government, the intelligence community's budget
is not going up at the old rates. Whether it is going down, or the planned
rate of growth has been sharply cut I don't recall, but perhaps someone with
hard information will chime in. So far all we've heard are politically
motivated assertions without a shred of evidence.

My comments are based on the defense and aerospace industry trade press, and
the Electronics Industry Association, which DO report numbers, despite the
widespread belief that they are unavailable. For those seriously interested
in this subject, rather than trying to make political hay here for ego
gratification purposes (I'm speaking generally, not to Mark), contact the
EIA. They are in Washington, D.C.

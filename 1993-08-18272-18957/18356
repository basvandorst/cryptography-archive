Most cryptographers aren't aware of ITAR. Most of those who are aware of
it don't care about it. Most of those who are aware of it and care about
it nevertheless assume (probably correctly) that it violates the First 
Amendment and hence won't hold up in court. And most of those who are 
aware of it, care about it, and don't have such faith in the First 
Amendment, nevertheless misunderstand the meaning of the ITAR 
``public-domain'' exemption, and think that it applies to them.

Only a few cryptographers are left. The journals get enough material 
from everybody else. (Besides, a good chunk of the stuff published in
crypto journals doesn't appear to be covered by the USML in the first 
place.)

You mean: ``that appears to prohibit.'' If ITAR is unconstitutional then 
it doesn't prohibit anything.

Anyway, ITAR 125.2(a) requires a license for export of unclassified 
technical data unless an exemption applies. ITAR 127.1(a)(1) makes it
unlawful to export technical data without a license whenever a license is
required. ITAR 120.17(4) defines ``disclosing technical data to a
foreign person'' as ``export.''

So it is unlawful to disclose technical data to a foreign person unless 
an exemption applies. ``Technical data'' is defined in part by ITAR
121.1 XIII(k) and ITAR 121.1 XIII(b)(1) to cover a lot of information
related to crypto (though certainly not all). And publication obviously 
entails disclosure to foreign persons.

Does that answer your question?

Mike, I have a suggestion before you go bandying any further legal theories
about:  please research them. I suggest, for a start, that you look at White
and Summers' hornbook on the Uniform Commercial Code. You will find that the
UCC is only a RECOMMENDATION, and no state (nor the Federal government) has
actually adopted it without changes (admittedly usually minor). It has always
been LEGISLATIVELY ADOPTED AS LAW, not promulgated by the executive or
judicial branches. 

You will also find that section 1-207 doesn't really mean what your previous
posts (and this post) say it does, because it is subject to overarching
definitions that specifically exclude non-commercial payments (e.g., to the IRS)
and many other situations. Further, YOU are subject to a requirement to act
"in good faith;" unfortunately, protesting exorbitant, but previously-disclosed,
charges by relying on dubious legal theories is NOT "good faith." Finally, as
interpreted in case law (and including special circumstances like state
regulation of utilities, etc.), the section probably doesn't make a damned bit
of difference to a single check payment for a single transaction.

Please don't get the idea that I necessarily LIKE this, since it puts all power
in the hands of the businesses; that's just the way it is.

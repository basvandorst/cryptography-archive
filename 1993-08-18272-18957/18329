Although the difficulty of finding the 80-bit key through a brute-force
search is of interest, of greater interest is the difficulty of finding
the key given 40 of its bits. The key escrow scheme assumes that a
government agency that has half of the key can do nothing useful with
it alone.  How true is this assumption?

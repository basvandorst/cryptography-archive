The simplest way I can think of is voice recognition.  If you can digitally
scan the voice of the card holder with them saying a phrase, and then store it
for later comparison, that is the most simplest way.  The only drawback I can
see is, the certain amount of leaway in the checking algorithm, that would
take care of poor phone transmissions.

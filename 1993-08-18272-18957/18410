I am a student working at a summer program in Israel, on cryptology.  I
have been working on theoreticly breaking NEWDES in C>
My program currently works but it used a
exhaustive search for passwords, which results in a million years
of running. I added an option for checking only common characters, but
that isn't enough. I am wondering this:

Has NEWDES even been broken with anything other than an exhaustive search,
and if so, how?

Please reply via e-mail to this account which I am borrowing.

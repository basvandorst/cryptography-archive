That's one system, but my AT&T Universal VISA card apparently does not 
NEED to contain my current PIN, either as such or as a offset, encrypted 
or otherwise.

I phoned the Customer Service number and picked a new PIN.  It couldn't
have gotten onto the card I had at the time.  (I cannot tell whether
AT&T recorded it on the NEXT-year's renewal card, but they didn't replace
my current card when I changed the PIN by telephone.)

This is clearly untrue.  There are algorithms which neither the NSA,
nor anyone else, can break under reasonable assumptons.  Just take
RSA, for example (i.e. actual exponentiation of the whole message, not
the hybrid RSA/Fixed-length conventional encryption schemes use by PGP
and RIPEM [not that there's anything wrong with them, just making an
example]).   If we do our calculations on presumed NSA computational
abilities -- assuming they have all the newest Cray's or Thinking
Machines, or whatever the newest and smartest machines are -- then
multiply all such abilities by ten or a hundred, it makes little
difference.  From the point of view of encryption, it's only nominally
more difficult to generate keys a *million* times more difficult to
break than we think the NSA actually can.  I really do think it's safe
to call anything which all reasonable assumptions say should take a
million years to crack 'safe'.  Even if "they"re a thousand times
smarter than we think... so what?

Of course, all this assumes that there's no breakthrough in factoring
by the NSA.  If there is, then both of our assumptions go out the
window... since for all we know the NSA might be able to transparently
monitor all our email traffic using their delapidated Z80's.
Obviously, when the math changes, all bets are off.

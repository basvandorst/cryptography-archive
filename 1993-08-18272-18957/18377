Question : 

   Does anyone out there have any knowledge of a communications
package for use with modems and PCs that can be used for
INTERACTIVE testing across phone lines? Preferably a package
with the capability to encrypt traffic and for an MS-DOS
environment. If anyone knows of a package that fits the above
description, could you please help!!!!

Thanks in advance,

John Camp

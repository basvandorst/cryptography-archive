I agree with the theory that says the NSA's real purpose is to 
deter general use of cryptography.  Let me put it in my words:

If cryptography is provided through hardware implementations,
then only a few design engineers need to know how it is done.  If
cryptography is provided through software implementations on
general purpose computers, then many people can and will learn
how it is done, write shareware versions, have software houses
competing to add features, etc., and the knowledge and general
use of strong cryptography will rapidly increase.

In my opinion, it is too late for the NSA to put the cat back in
the bag (or he worms back in the can, or whatever metaphor you 
like).  Computers are inherently code machines in that they
manipulate bits and execute algorithms.  Large scale use of
data compression means the data streams already look more and
more like encrypted data.

Even if the government tried to ban encryption, they would be
unable to enforce it without shutting down the phone network
and the mail system (you can pass a message on a floppy disk
containing encrypted data sent via Federal Express as well
as any other method).

Try "money".

As in, drug dealers / foreign countries have lots of it. Give enough of it
to the *humans* (i.e., by definition, fallible and bribable) in charge of
the escrow and it will be broken.

I don't care how well they're chosen or how many safeguards there are--
it can, and therefore will, be broken.

Proof? Rosenberg. Walker. Others I can't even think of or don't know or
haven't even heard of and neither have you-- because what they stole
is so sensitive that to make public that it was stolen is a security
violation.

And before you start saying that last is ridiculous-- many years ago, when
I worked for Link Flight Simulation, several people who had discussed a
"black" project in Binghamton-- "project x"-- who were not on the project,
and were not privy to any sensitive information on it, other than its
existence-- were investigated and instructed not to speculate on the
nature of the project any more.

And no, I'm not going to say what those speculations were. I don't need
the trouble.

I have had to identify myself to AmEx via telephone during credit
checks before, so let me share with you the details.  I bought
something WAY expensive and put it on my AmEx card.  The merchant
scanned the card, got some sort of message, placed a call to AmEx, and
gave me the phone.  I was asked two or three questions, including my
mother's maiden name.  The clerk was not very close to me, althought
someone could have been listening/recording via an extension.

Yes, there are holes big enought to drive an oil tanker through, but I
feel comfortable with it.  The question is only asked when a
transaction is somehow "out of the ordinary".  I generally only use my
AmEx card with merchants who have been in business a number of years,
which lessens the likelyhood of dishonesty.  I guard myself against
casual evesdropping, although not against the merchant having hired two
dishonest employees who are cooperating.  I suppose if I were
sufficiently paranoid, I could insist on dialing AmEx's phone number
myself (and carry it around with me).  And of course, I never gave AmEx
my mother's _real_ maiden name, I use a trick from a book ("The Crash
of '79", I think) in which the hero used Richard Nixon's middle name in
a similar situation.

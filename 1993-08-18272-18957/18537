We once asked the IBM folks who developed DES why the key was only 56 bits
and if the NSA had anything to do with the length.  They replied 56 bits
was all they could get on the chip they developed (remember, this was
before 8080s even!) and the NSA had nothing to do with the length.  

But I am sure the NSA is glad the key is only 56 bits...  :)

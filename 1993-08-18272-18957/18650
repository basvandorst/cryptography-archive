During the war the Swiss used a machine based on the commercial model
of the Enigma without a stecker-board. This machine went under the
BP name Indigo.

Also during the war Norway used Hagelin machines. In 1940-42 they
used a model of the C-38. Later (1943) they used a newer Hagelin model,
the C-443A which is an improved C-48A machine.

The Poles used their own machine LACIDA, which is a rotor machine
partly based on the Enigma.

But all of these countries also used several hand ciphers and codes.
It was first after the war that these countries got offers of US or
UK machines. In the case of Norway they got Typex machines from England
and KL-7 machines from USA. Other countries got offers of cheap Enigma
machines, :-).

If others know of specific machines or systems used by these countries
during and after the war I would like very much to know. My knowledge
in this field is far from complete. Please use e-mail if you like.

If somebody would take on the task of quoteing from the NY Times article
I would be very grateful. It is difficult to get hold of this paper over
here. Or has it been reprinted in the International Herald Tribune?

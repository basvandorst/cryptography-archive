Apple falling to earth?  Interesting, VERY interesting!!

Since I'm a former Apple fanatic I really don't want them to fall to far.  
Not to mention still having some friends there, but...

Anyway, I'm not sure I'm provide "real" info, but I keep shouting about the
FAQ ftp site RTFM.MIT.EDU  In the dir \PUB\USENET you'll find  A LOT of FAQs.
It'll take, as you can imagine, anon ftp.  Once you're on try typing mls <cr>
when prompted type *<cr>.  That should, if mem serves to collect all the 
files on the distant end.  You'll be prompted for a local file.  I used FAQ<
CR>  You should be downloading the entire list of faqs with those steps.  

Assuming of course you want to so you can browse off-line.

If you can't seem to snag a particular file...try "get<cr>" WITHOUT 
specifying a file.  You'll be prompted for a file name.   Pick the one you 
want to get.

Next you'll be prompted for the file name you want your system to use when 
it's delivered to you.  Pick something SMALL, but meaningful.  That's likely 
to work properly.

Good luck!!

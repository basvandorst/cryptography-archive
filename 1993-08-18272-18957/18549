But Biham and Shamir showed that increasing the key size of DES beyond 
56 bits did not improve its security against differential cryptanalysis.
Making the DES key size larger than 56 bits would only have made implementations
more expensive and would not have increased the cost to a sophisticated
attacker who knew about differential cryptanalysis.

It is very important to remember that key size alone is NOT an indicator
of strength of algorithm.   Exhaustive search is NOT the usual way to
break a reasonably strong crypto system.  

(I am not saying that DES and/or Skipjack are or are not good algorithms.
I am only saying that key size is not the primary criterion of goodness.)

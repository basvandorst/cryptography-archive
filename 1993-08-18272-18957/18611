DES is a general purpose scheme.

Suppose you had hardware support for DES to/from your disk.  You can check most
of the encryption hardware by writing and reading back a block.  That doesn't
check the key though.  If the chip got the wrong key, say because a bit got
dropped somewhere when loading the key, the decryption unit will still undo the
encryption so a readback will appear to work.  (This assumes you have one chip
that uses a single key to do both encryption and decryption.)  When you load the
correct key later on, the file will decrypt to garbage and thus the data is lost.

Assume the designers of DES knew enough about differential cryptoanalysis to know
that they only needed 56 bits of key.  Wouldn't it make sense to use the other
bits for parity?


Mangled keys are not such a delicate problem for applications like encrypting
telephones.  If one key gets mangled, the signal will get incorrectly decrypted
at the other end.  The result will sound like noise and the humans will notice
that something is wrong very quickly.

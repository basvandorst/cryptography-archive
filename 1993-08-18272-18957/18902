Subject: ATM Scam (RISKS-14.60 to 74)

In recent RISKS, there have been some details on the fake ATM being set up in
a shopping mall in New Haven.

Last week at the 5th FIRST Incident Response Workshop, an agent of
the Secret Service regaled the audience with some details of the case:

 * Several people were arrested
 * One has admitted everything and is cooperating with authorities
 * over 300 accounts at over 50 banks were hit by the counterfeit cards
 * over 100K in fraudulent charges were made with the captured cards

This was not an isolated incident, but the latest in a 12-year string of fraud
activity that may have netted over 12 million dollars.  Included in this past
history were computer-assisted forgeries of stocks, bonds, passports, military
IDs, and even law enforcement IDs.  On several occasions the people involved
used forged ID documents to carry guns on-board airplanes.

  [5th FIRST?  Perhaps they drank a 5th FIRST?  PGN]

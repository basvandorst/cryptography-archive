   If that's true, then cannot one create a sort of one-time-pad engine
   which takes a small pseudo-random input, runs it through DES,
   then takes the output and feeds that back in as input, thus generating
   a perpetual stream of one-time pad data? Is it not possible to
   synchronize two such generators at the start and get a strong
   one-time-pad system this way?

First of all, it's only a one-time-pad system if you only use the
numbers once; any re-use is dangerous.  Technically, it's only a
one-time pad system if the input is really a stream of random
numbers; if you can generate them all from a short input stream
(the pseudo-random input generator), then it's also not a one-time pad.

(You may also note the similarity between your method and
Output-Feed-Back-mode DES use.)

As far as practical problems with such a system, if your PRNG gets
into loops, as most do after a while, then your DES(PRNG(i)) will
also get into loops, unless you're running it in some kind of block
chaining mode - and if you're going to that much trouble, why not just
use DES in that mode in the first place?  Loops are especially risky
if you're trying to use it as a one-time-pad-substitute.
If simple DES isn't strong enough for your perceived risk,
try using triple-DES.  Alternatively, use real DES to do the encryption,
and also XOR the result with your PRNG.

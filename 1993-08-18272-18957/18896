	I've been thinking about this, and wondering if a very old
	method might work.  Supposedly it's been used at the Bank of
	England for centuries.

	The method is the introduction of a random element.  The keys
	are stored in a manner that requires access using a combination
	of a key card and a physiognomic measurement (hand geometry, eye
	blood vessel pattern).  You start with 2 or 3 people on duty for
	release of keys.  After this group has read and accepted the
	warrant, a further one or two people are chosen by a random
	(or pseudo random) process from a much larger group (perhaps all
	employees in the escrow agency at work at that time) to complete
	the release process.

	I think the need to cover essentially every member of the group
	to obtain an improper release of the key greatly increases the
	odds.  It is going to be awkward for the escrow agency, but
	security almost always has to be traded against convenience.

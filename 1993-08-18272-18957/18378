The unit key is used to encrypt the session key and send it out in the
Law Enforcement Enabling Field (er Law Enforcement Access Field, I guess
it turned over a new leaf ala sunshine units).  A target transmission can
be recorded for decoding after the key escrow key is turned over either after 
a court order or in the case of National Security (tm) upon request.

Stealing a phone every time you want a secure telephone conference would
only be worth while if the information you were protecting was of tactical
importance only ("... in 5 minutes, blow the bridge").

   True.  But there's also the idea that people will adopt popular phrases
modified to be obscene, racist, anti-feminist, or otherwise politically
incorrect.
   [NOTE: for those who are sensitive to examples of this kind of thing,
use your 'n' or 'j' key NOW... explicit examples follow!]

   Examples of my assertion:

"The quick brown nigger jumped over the lazy welfare recipient."
"Now is the time for all good feminists to come to the aid of their suicide."
etc.


:(2) Since the domain of shocking nonsense is so much bigger, the NSA
:like any other reasonable crack designer cognizant of fact (1) will
:*still* look for the weak ones first...

   But they'll be adding all the naughty, racist, etc. terms to their
"dictionaries".

:'Ululating ponies ferment kisses from my fistulae.' has quite a
:bit of entropy -- even given the constraint of being grammatical it still
:has probably millions of time greater than required for a DES key...

   Now THERE is an idea.  Take some of the better cryptograms from some of
the books out there that have _extremely_ abstruse wording, with frequency
distributions that barely resemble those of _any_ language, and use one of
those.  Some of the better ones from OHAVER, etc. might work.

   I tend to prefer nonsense words I make up myself.  One I used (but use
no more after this posting) was "grisl snarf the ramfam progit".  Of course,
one has to be sure the words are made up by himself and not vaguely remembered
from some other source, like "veeblefetzer" or "zorben plotz" (from an old
Yellow Pages commercial) or that sort of thing.  Another good way of making
up such nonsense words is to consult a table (available in most good
cryptology books) of the odds of a particular letter following another, but
unfortunately the only ones I've seen are for the English language.

   In regards to using foreign languages, it doesn't hurt to mix languages
every word; a passphrase of one Russian, one Spanish, one Urdu, one Tagalog
and one Sioux word might not stop NSA, but it sure wouldn't be easily
cracked by the average non-Cray-owner.

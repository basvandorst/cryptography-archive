   Has anyone seen any work done on extending

Sure.  In some sense, that's what IDEA and probably SkipJack are.
The original Lucifer/DES design work showed that getting the details
right is very important, so some extensions have worked out and some haven't.

      W H Murray, and several others, also pointed out to me that you could
   make the barely feasible keysearch of DES too expensive by simply changing
   keys often.  This essentially gives a linear, rather than squaring,
   increase in work to break the cipher, but if keysearching 56 bits is
   a million-dollar operation once, it's a billion dollar operation if you
   have to keysearch 56-bits 1,000 times.

Keysearching bits is approximately a $10,000 job (assuming a $50M machine
doing 2 keys per day, amortized over 5-10 years) (there are a couple
of designs that can do a complete 1-day search for $50M, and you expect
a hit after trying half the keys, on average.)  Raising the cost by 1000
is nice, assuming of course that you can't predict the new key from the old,
and that the keys don't share a common known plaintext (e.g. each new key
being followed by a block of 0's or SYNC..SYNC or something, which
would let you find all of the keys on one 56-bit keysearch.)

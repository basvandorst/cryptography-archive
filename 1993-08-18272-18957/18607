Readers of this group may have noticed the article
(NYT 11 August 93 P A6) in which Gar Alperovitz,
a fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies in
Washington successfully sued the NSA under the FOIA.

The NSA claimed that declassification would cause 'grave
damage' to the national security.  Among other revelations,
it shows how the NSA could read codes by Belgium. Bolivia,
Bulgaria, Chile, China, Columbia, Denmark, Ecuador, Egypt,
Finaldn, France, Greece, Iran, Italy, Liberia, Luxembourg,
Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Paraguay, Peru, Poland,
Portugal, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Switzerland, Syria, Turkey,
Uruguay, Venezuela, and Yugoslavia in additon to Germany
and Japan in 1945.

The newly declassified release is over 800 pages
of intercepts according to the article.

It underscores how we ought not to underestimate the
crypto ability of the NSA.

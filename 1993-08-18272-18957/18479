  While I agree that personal comments are uncalled for, the fact of the
matter remains that Dr. Denning has, by her public statements, built a
reputation for herself as a shill for the government's anti-privacy
position.  Hence, her presence on an "independent" commission to study
the government's proposal would make a mockery of the whole study, were
it not for the fact that the idea of "independent" experts selected by
the government side was already a mockery from Square One.

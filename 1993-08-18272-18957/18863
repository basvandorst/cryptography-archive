 I think the point is not that they would/would not use the ``secure clipper
phones,'' but that they would use the algorithm to design their own secure
phones that couldn't be tapped.

 One who was smart enough to analyze an algorithm for security, but not to
devise one.

 Maybe you're missing the idea between the ``encoding algorithm'' and the
actual implementation.

 No. Maybe this is an (expensive?) experiment of some kind.

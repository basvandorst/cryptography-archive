It is not clear from the announcement that the freeware doesn't violate
PKP's patents in the U.S. Nothing was said in the commercial announcement
about the freeware version of PGP being legitimized.

One hopes one will hear more about this from those who have been in touch
with RSADSI about the commercial licensing.

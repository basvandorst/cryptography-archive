Because, aside from the possibility of bans on competing cryptosystems,
if the Feds create a market for Clipperphones, and allow progammable ones,
(or ones with easily replaced PROMs), it may be easy to turn your
Clipperphone into a non-tappable one by simple application of firmware,
and meanwhile you might have relatively cheap commercial hardware.

Of course, if the next edition of the Soundblaster will just have the
decency to put a user-programmable DSP chip on it, we'll be able to do
the voice compression there, which is the hard part of building secure phones,
and anybody will be able to get one for a hundred bucks or so.

Thank you, Dr. Denning, for posting the Skipjack report in a timely
manner.  On the whole, it looks like good news.  In particular, I was
happy to see these paragraphs:

>5.   Secrecy of the Algorithm

>The SKIPJACK algorithm is sensitive for several reasons.  Disclosure of
>the algorithm would permit the construction of devices that fail to
>properly implement the LEAF, while still interoperating with legitimate
>SKIPJACK devices.  Such devices would provide high quality
>cryptographic security without preserving the law enforcement access
>capability that distinguishes this cryptographic initiative.
[. . .]
>However, while full exposure of the internal details of SKIPJACK would
>jeopardize law enforcement and national security objectives, it would
>not jeopardize the security of encrypted communications.  This is
>because a shortcut attack is not feasible even with full knowledge of
>the algorithm.  Indeed, our analysis of the susceptibility of SKIPJACK
>to a brute force or shortcut attack was based on the assumption that
>the algorithm was known.

>Conclusion 3:  While the internal structure of SKIPJACK must be
>classified in order to protect law enforcement and national security
>objectives, the strength of SKIPJACK against a cryptanalytic attack
>does not depend on the secrecy of the algorithm.

Why did this make me so happy, when I am generally so displeased
with the Clipper initiative and the key-escrow scheme?

Because the disclosure of the Skipjack algorithm is INEVITABLE.

You can bet that {the top bad guys of the moment} will pry loose
the algorithm within a year.  While they may not be public-spirited
enough to immediately release it to the rest of us, eventually
someone will.                -- George Mitchell (george@tessi.com)

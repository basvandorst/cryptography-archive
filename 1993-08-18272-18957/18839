Do you really think that it's possible for NSA to keep it secret     
         
that they've broken factoring? That's a *major* discovery. And they  
         
are a *large* group.

Yeah, and how many people in the NSA would know that it had been
done? 100?  Probably a lot less.  AWE are a large group in the UK,
not everyone knows the exact dimensions of their Trident warheads....

I'm not saying it *has* been done, just that it *could* be kept
secret.  Like teh UK ops to break the Enigma code, the details of
which were kept under wraps until relatively recently.

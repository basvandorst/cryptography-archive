I am soliciting comments on UNIX security books.  The three that
I know of are:

     Patrick H. Wood and Stephen G. Kochan, UNIX System Security,
     Indianapolis: Hayden Books, 1985.

     Simson Garfinkel and Gene Spafford, Practical UNIX Security,
     Sebastopol, Calif.: O'Reilly & Associates, Inc., 1991.

     David A. Curry, UNIX System Security, Reading, Mass:
     Addison-Wesley Publishing Co., 1992.

What do they cover?  Do they cover those topics well?  What is
missing from their coverage?  Who is the target audience?  Etc?

Are there any other UNIX security books that I am overlooking?

Thanks for any and all comments.

Bruce

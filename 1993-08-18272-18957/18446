John, my friend, look at the distribution of most of these notes.  They say 
"world" and it's a mighty big place.

Myself, I confidently expect to see Skipjack published in some Eurocrypt
proceedings or other in the next 4 or 5 years, especially if the darn thing
is actually produced in any volumes.  There is a decidely
different attitude in W. Europe towards this sort of thing.

It's mostly a question of economics.  Will someone, somewhere put out the
bucks to do a "tear down" of the chip and figure out how it works.  I could
imagine some crypto company in Europe doing just that and being also motivated
to publish what they find for competitive reasons. . .

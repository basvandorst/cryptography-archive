This is true.  The word *all* is the key.

We will have to see what is actually realized in Clipper Key Management. 
I haven't read a final "process and procedures" document. (Does any one
have the specific document?)  The phone line may not be the "only channel
available".

The better ones do anyway.
Systems built around a Certified Key Management systems like the (Overt
Motorola Ad follows) KCA 2400 may introduce  one or more  additional
channels:  A physical channel with initial keying, and/or other channels
with other information.  True, the phone line is used for the
certification call, but is therefore *not* " the only channel available".
 The realities of  attacking *all"* channels are amusing.

It's true that theoretical Man in the Middle Attacks are interesting
discussion.  However, when a secured secondary / third channel is added
such that in KCA-2400 based equipment, the attacks are purely academic
from a realistic perspective.



Hope that helps.

   It occurs to me that Skipjack may be being kept classified for another
reason, besides the obvious desire to avoid Clipper-compatible non-escrowed
phones.  The internal structure of DES, and in particular the design of its
S-boxes and permutation, led at least partially to the open-literature
rediscovery of differential cryptanalysis.  Suppose (plausibly) that there
are other methods of attacking product ciphers, perhaps discovered since the
design of DES.  If NSA wishes to keep these out of the open literature,
it needs to make sure that any internal structures in Skipjack that are
especially resistant to this kind of attack are not publicly discussed.
 
   Does anyone have any particular guesses as to why SKIPJACK would have
only an 80-bit key?  128 bits seems like a large enough key that it won't
be susceptible to brute-force search anytime in the forseeable future, but
80 bits may be susceptible in the next 10-15 years.  Is this an attempt to
build in an "expiration date?"

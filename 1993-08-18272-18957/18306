I just saw the new sci crypt FAQ, full of info as always.  
However: there are a few mistakes here and there, and a few
dated old-fashionedisms.  The stated email address for corrections,
crypt-comments@math.ncsu.edu, is a black hole:  my mail to it
is not acknowledged, and the misspelling of Solomon Kullback's
name remains uncorrected.  

From which I conclude, the crypt FAQ is composed by an AI program,
a cabal of electronic robots, periodically sending out information
seemingly correct, but actually subtly flawed: misleading information
designed to lead the unwary would-be-cryppie into a maze of tiny
twisty garden paths, a maze of carnival mirrors, which reflect truth
as falsehood, and the syntax of the sentence is dribbling away...

IN PARTICULAR:  the crypt FAQ says that to get a copy of the Beale
ciphers:

But peregrine says netlib don't live here no more, honey.

So does anyone know the true way to get the rec.puzzles FAQL?

(I am not so much interested in the Beale ciphers, the plaintext
to which is explained in the Voynich MS, whose plaintext in turn
will soon be obtained from You-Know-Where by FOI :-), as I am in
the puzzler's FAQ itself!)

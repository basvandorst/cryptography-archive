This is a followup to my own post.

After thinking about it a little I realized that to automate the scan of the  
alt.crypt.messages news group you would have to load your private key into  
memory for an extended period of time.  This is probably a bad thing unless you  
are confident that no one has physical access to your machine.

Perhaps there are some tamperproof hardward devices or chips that would make  
extended storage of a private key less risky.

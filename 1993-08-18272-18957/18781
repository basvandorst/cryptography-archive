Ummm... think about it again.  If you're A, and I'm B, you've already
told me "pq = 15" before I guess "p > q".  Once this is done, it's
pretty darn difficult to fake two primes besides 5 and 3 whose produce
is 15.

I do somehow have a hunch myself that something subtle is wrong with
the poster's idea... but I actually can't figure out what it might be
so far.

Yours, Lulu...

I would like to bypass the arguments over skipjack to ask instead
if this three port algorithm can be uses as a normal building block
for a secure protocol?  for example in a transaction protocol or
in enciphered mail (just examples).  The "cc" processing  for some secure
mail (x.400) systems is not clean. Another example is a many to one
encryption system. These are just suggestions. 

The algorithm could have uses beyond simple point-to-point security
that are getting lost in the argument.

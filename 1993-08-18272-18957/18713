If I have a DES decoding device which is using a key that is unknown to me,
and I can let the input be anything I want and then acquire the output,
is there a set of different inputs that I can give it that can be used to
determine the key.  This is different from my last question is so far as
I would be able to determine the input text as well as send sereral input
texts through the system.  Can these multiple inputs along with their
respective outputs be used to find the key, or at least part of the key
(44 bits or so)?  I have received conflicting reports on the possibility
of finding the key from an input and output text which are known.  Does
anyone have any more information of the Biham and Shamir differential
cryptanalysis method?

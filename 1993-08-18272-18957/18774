I think the only safe assumption is that the NSA can break any algorithm.
What we can do is try to make it as costly as possible, so that it isn't
worth the effort for them to break it, at least just for fishin'.

And the more people use good crypto, the stronger any given one becomes,
because of the reduced availability (dilution) of resources.

What one must guess is a minimum time frame to break a good algorithm,
and make sure nothing is included that will be useful beyond that time.
"Forever" info, that is valuable at any time, is going to always be a
crapshoot sending over a wire or the air, regardless of how it is
encrypted, other than via a properly done OTP.  I suspect a triple DES
would not make the folks at NSA happy.  They would have a choice of let
most of the traffic go, or burn up their budget trying to crack it all.
With a lot of folks using strong crypto, even for a grocery list, the
chances of a good snoop go down.  I would like to see ALL e-mail sent
using strong crypto - RIPEM at a minimum, RIPEM w/triple DES better,
and I dunno how PGP with IDEA stands in all this.

If they are going to poke their noses into our private affiars, it is
only right to make them WORK HARD for it.  Make them have to justify
the effort, via finite resources.

They must be getting strained in some areas, otherwise they would not
be trying to stop all but 'joke' or 'toy' crypto w/o escrowed keys
in the hands of commoners.  Despite the assurances some nameless
bureaucrat with questionable authority gives that they would never
do such a thing like outlaw crypto.

Has anybody come out with a triple DES program that doesn't require
chaining 3 processes in pipes yet - I could try to make one using
the existing libraries, but fear I might botch it one way or another,
due to lack of understanding how things work.  Wouldn't be too useful
if one with the key and a different program couldn't decrypt....  I
would really like to see some library that could be plugged in where
a prior std DES library was used - each call to encrypt a block would
actually do the triple DES on it...

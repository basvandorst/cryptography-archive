This question may be a bit elementary for the folk on this list, but if
you could spare a moment for a simplistic question....

I'm in charge of a (roughly) 5,000 name list, with the obvious fields
(name/address/phone/some other stuff).  It's stored on a micro which is
standalone and reasonably secure.

I'm -not- looking to prevent an NSA level breakin, but I would like to
prevent, or at least reduce, casual enquiries.

So what I'm looking for:

a) some encryption of the data. I want to prevent anyone from simply
walking to the computer while others are away at lunch, going to DOS, and
doing a "copy file.lst to floppy"  Again, NSA excluded....

b) an audit trail which would generate reports of the type "user XYZ
accessed the data base from 6-7 pm on jul 10th"

c) and, optimally, an enhanced audit which would say "user XYZ looked up
the records of ABC, JKL, etc. on ....."

I'm a bit of a rookie in this stuff. I'd imagine that a is readily
available, and that 'b' is out there. I haven't even a hint of something
that will do 'c' on a micro.

some technical stuff: all this is done on a standalone PC type micro, most
likely running DRDOS (although Windows can be used). The initial data
would probably be typed in ascii (offsite) and ported over. 

Again, Im not looking for an NSA-proof system, just a 'gee, while
everyone's gone to lunch, let me look up Joe's address....'

any and all suggestions cheerfully accepted, and apologies again for the
elementary stuff here.

thanks

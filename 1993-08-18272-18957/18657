However, it is axiomatic in cryptography that if your security depends
on the secrecy of your algorithm, then there is NO security. Even the
NSA's prime appologist, Dorothy Denning, in her cryptography textbook
freely admits this. Additionally, as one of the reviewers of Skipjack, she
states that the algorithm is only being kept secret so that the "Law
Enforcement Access Field" can not be faked. 

Of course, there is no law saying the NSA has to be consistent or correct
when trying to avoid FOIA requests. All that matters is what they can 
convince the judge is legal. As has been said before, "National Security"
is the root password to the constitution.

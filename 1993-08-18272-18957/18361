Assuming you made an accurate representation of it, I feel it my
duty to obey the law of the land -- the constitution.  Many of the
readers of sci.crypt do not have the luxury of having one; so we must do
what we can to defend it.  Therefore I will continue to publish
research and technical data relating to cryptography.

Just last evening I read the article "An Escape from Kampala"
by Wycliffe Kato. It is a authentic account of the pure horror of
arbitrary dictatorships.  We do not have routine torture, strangulation,
or cannibalism here yet. So to my mind "fear, uncertainty, and doubt"
are completely inadequate reasons for cowardice in the face of
the enemy that I am ashamed to say appears to be some members
of our own government.

If anyone has qualms about following the law of the land, please
send your technical data to me for publication.

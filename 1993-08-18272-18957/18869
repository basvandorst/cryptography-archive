   Bill Stewart replied to a question of mine a few days back....
 
   I was asking specifically about extending the DES algorithm by adding
rounds and altering the key-scheduling algorithm.  I understand that any
encryption algorithm with a longer key than DES is an attempt to get that
level of security with a key that will resist brute-force searches.  But
I was wondering about extensions of DES, since that's clearly quite strong,
and since we already use triple-DES, which is effectively a 48-round DES
with a particularly dumb key scheduling algorithm.

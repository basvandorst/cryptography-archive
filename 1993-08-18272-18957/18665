I presume you must be referring to the Free poles and Norwegians, based in 
the UK and not the national 'puppet' Norwegian government or the German 
administration in the area that had been Poland?

But 1945 (well, most of it) was after the war in Europe. Certainly, there 
were national administrations re-established in France, Holland and Italy 
(by 1945 a US ally). I'm not sure when the Norwegian administration was 
re-instated but it can't have been later than mid-1945. AFAIK the Danish and 
Finnish administrations were largely a continuum of those that had existed 
under German 'protection'.

A long time ago, there was someone who mentioned some new fingerprint
and checksum program(s) that he/she would post.  Nothing's been heard
on this end, and I wonder if someone could point me to where I could
find these.

Also:  I've been told that there are a few other 'public-key' type
crypto programs out there (some not popular, and one supposedly cracked).
Could someone tell me where to get these also?

Thanks...

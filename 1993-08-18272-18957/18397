    Those whose interest in cryptography extends beyond RSA, PGP,
Clipper, Skipjack, and paranoia, may like to pick up the current issue
of Smithsonian magazine.

    There's an excellent article on the Navaho code talkers who
performed secure tactical communications in the Pacific theatre during
WW2. Their code (a combination of obscure Navaho synomnyms and
nomenclator-like encoding), was never broken, even by native Navaho
speakers. It permitted full-speed secure speech communication under
battle conditions, and it's use was decisive in a number of campaigns,
such as Io Jima.

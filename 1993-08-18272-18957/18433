   Believe it or not, for several years the FCC considered ASCII as a "secret
code" for purposes of amateur radio operations.  It took a lot of convincing
to show them that ASCII was a world standard, documented in thousands of
places, in wide use throughout the world and very easily "decrypted".
Previous to that, only 5- or 8-bit Baudot was allowed.  So anything's possible,
but at least there's precedent now to show that ASCII isn't considered an
encryption or code by at least one branch of the USGov't.

   Doesn't count.  All that really counts is what the courts are going to say.

>uuencode/decode zip are all crypto systems.

   Again, widely documented and distributed.  Also, their primary purpose is
to put data into a form communicable by printable characters, in a format more
efficient than sending hex dumps.

   With our Gov't, it could happen.  1/2 :-)

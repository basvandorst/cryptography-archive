Clearly the only reasonable way phone taps can be done with Clipper
is to decrypt the LEAF with the system key (which is going to be
a big secret in the hands of law enforcement, just like NCIC never
releases information), grab the serial numbers of the two Clipper
phones, and then go get a court order for the keys.  The interesting
part here, of course, is that it might be difficult to actually tap
someone if they use a different Clipper chip for every conversation.
The court order for the first one goes in, and boom, a new clipper
phone is in use.  Of course, law enforcement will hold onto the
key until the next time the phone is used.

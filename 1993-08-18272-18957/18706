THIS WAS ORIGINALLY IN COMP.SYS.AMIGA.PROGRAMMER

LL> My own, not-that-complicated algorithm. But if I weren't convinced of its

LL> The basic idea:

LL> 1) Make a less redundant password from the one the user supplies (this

LL> 2) store the resulting binary-string in a "ring-buffer"

LL> 3) Build a sum from the password and its length, and take this as

LL> 4) for each byte to be encrypted, do the following:

LL>    -XOR the actual data byte with the byte on the actual position
LL>     in the ringbuffer
LL>    -store the result of this XOR increased by one to the ring-buffer

LL>   add the result to the offset in the ring-buffer.

LL>    -XOR the actual data byte with the byte on the now actual position
LL>      in the ringbuffer
LL>     -store the result of this second XOR increased by one to the
LL> ring-buffer

LL>   add the result to the offset in the ring-buffer.

LL>   return the last result

Can anyone tell me if the above method is safe?  It is to be used in an
Amiga real-time encryption terminal program.  The author is also giving
a free chest of beer to the first person to break the code.

thanks in advance!

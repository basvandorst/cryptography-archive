I'm hoping that some kind soul out there can help me get my hands
on the following paper:

   1) Xuejia Lai, "Detailed Description and a Software Implementation of
      the IPES Cipher", Institute for Signal and Information
      Processing, ETH-Zentrum, Zurich, Switzerland, 1991

Our library here tells me that there is absolutely no way that they
can get it for me.  If anyone out there has this paper, or has access
to it, I'll gladly send you an SAE and however much money you think
it will take to cover postage, copying, and your time and effort. :-)
Many thanks in advance.

                                   Ken

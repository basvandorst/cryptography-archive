   That is, I might email my key to Alice, Bob and Carol, each
   of whom signs it, indicating that they all think that the key
   *probably* really does belong to me.  I then make public this signed key,
   ......    [also distributing by finger]

Email and finger, by themselves, aren't good enough for anything you
need to trust.  PGP lets you produce a key "fingerprint", which is a
hash of the key short enough to read over the phone or put in
.signature files.  So in addition to emailing your key to Alice, Bob,
and Carol, you need to have a conversation with them by other channels
(e.g. voice, if they know your voice enough to identify by phone,
prefereably on a phone call initiated by them, or in person if you see them),
to verify that the fingerprint for the key they have is correct.
Similarly, if you put your key fingerprint in your signatures,
or on your business cards, or otherwise widely distribute it,
it reduces the chances of someone spoofing your finger server.
Still possible, of course, as is spoofing the key servers;
that's why the "Web of Trust" of signatures is helpful.
(And, really, how often do you check that the key in your finger file
hasn't been tampered with?)

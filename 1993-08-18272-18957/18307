nope, that's 1E4/4000= 2.5 - Tehre are 4000 or so different salts, so
you have to do 4000 times as much work as if there were only one salt.
Of course this assumes that you really have a random password- most
(all?) people don't. Thus intelligent password cracking programs would
work a lot faster. ( How many people could remember %h]+^7Xu as their
password?

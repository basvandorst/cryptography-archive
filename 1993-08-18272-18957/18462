Peter D. Junger was kind enough to put ITAR on an anonymous ftp:

>A new version of the ITAR has just been issued.  You can download it by
>anonymous FTP from my machine:  SAMSARA.LAW.CWRU.EDU.  The file you want
>is either ITAR.WP (where line-endings are not marked and the
>end-of-paragraph marker is CR/LF) or ITAR.ASC (where the right margin is
>set at 80 and the end-of-line marker is CR/LF).

I grabbed itar.asc, it's about 340K.  I haven't read it (it's pure
bureaucratic bullshit) but here are a few excerpts which relate to several
discussions that have been burning in flames here.

|PART 121-THE UNITED STATES MUNITIONS LIST
|  Enumeration of Articles
|  Sec.
|  121.1 General. The United States Munitions List.
|  121.2 Interpretations of the United States Munitions List and the Missile
|Technology Control Regime Annex.
|  121.3 Aircraft and related articles.
|  121.4 Amphibious vehicles.
|  121.5 Apparatus and devices under Category IV(c).
|  121.6 Cartridge and shell casings.
|  121.7 Chemical agents.
|  121.8 End-items, components, accessories, attachments, parts, firmware,
|software and systems.
|  121.9 Firearms.
|  121.10 Forgings, castings and machined bodies.
|  121.11 Military demolition blocks and blasting caps.
|  121.12 Military explosives.
|  121.13 Military fuel thickeners.
|  121.14 Propellants.
|  121.15 Vessels of war and special naval equipment.
|  121.16 Missile Technology Control Regime Annex.

Under section 121.1 they have a ton of exceptions:

|  Category XIII-Auxiliary Military Equipment
[delete section on space cameras]
|   (b) Information Security Systems and equipment, cryptographic devices,
|software, and components specifically designed or modified therefor, including:
|   (1) Cryptographic (including key management) systems, equipment, assemblies,
|modules, integrated circuits, components or software with the capability of
|maintaining secrecy or confidentiality of information or information systems,
>|except< cryptographic equipment and software as follows:

|   (i) Restricted to decryption functions specifically designed to allow the
|execution of copy protected software, provided the decryption functions are not
|user-accessible.
|   (ii) Specially designed, developed or modified for use in machines for
|banking or money transactions, and restricted to use only in such transactions.
|Machines for banking or money transactions include automatic teller machines,
|self-service statement printers, point of sale terminals or equipment for the
|encryption of interbanking transactions.
|   (iii) Employing only analog techniques to provide the cryptographic
|processing that ensures information security in the following applications:
|   (A) Fixed (defined below) band scrambling not exceeding 8 bands and in which
|the transpositions change not more frequently than once every second;
|   (B) Fixed (defined below) band scrambling exceeding 8 bands and in which the
|transpositions change not more frequently than once every ten seconds;
|   (C) Fixed (defined below) frequency inversion and in which the 
|transpositions
|change not more frequently than once every second;
|   (D) Facsimile equipment;
|   (E) Restricted audience broadcast equipment;
|   (F) Civil television equipment.
|   Note: Special Definition. For purposes of this subparagraph, fixed means that
|the coding or compression algorithm cannot accept externally supplied parameters
|(e.g., cryptographic or key variables) and cannot be modified by the user.
|   (iv) Personalized smart cards using cryptography restricted for use only in
|equipment or systems exempted from the controls of the USML.
|  (v) Limited to access control, such as automatic teller machines, self-
|service statement printers or point of sale terminals, which protects password
|or personal identification numbers (PIN) or similar data to prevent unauthorized
|access to facilities but does not allow for encryption of files or text, except
|as directly related to the password of PIN protection.
|   (vi) Limited to data authentication which calculates a Message Authentication
|Code (MAC) or similar result to ensure no alteration of text has taken place, or
|to authenticate users, but does not allow for encryption of data, text or other
|media other than that needed for the authentication.
|   (vii) Restricted to fixed data compression or coding techniques.
|   (viii) Limited to receiving for radio broadcast, pay television or similar
|restricted audience television of the consumer type, without digital encryption
|and where digital decryption is limited to the video, audio or management
|functions.
|   (ix) Software designed or modified to protect against malicious computer
|damage, (e.g., viruses).

[YOU BET!  No sir, I didn't want the CIA damaging my computer, that's why I'm using
	triple DES with IDEA to protect these files]

|   Note: A procedure has been established to facilitate the expeditious transfer
|to the Commodity Control List of mass market software products with encryption
|that meet specified criteria regarding encryption for the privacy of data and
|the associated key management. Requests to transfer commodity jurisdiction of
|mass market software products designed to meet the specified criteria may be
|submitted in accordance with the commodity jurisdiction provisions of  120.4.
|Questions regarding the specified criteria or the commodity jurisdiction process
|should be addressed to the Office of Defense Trade Controls. All mass market
|software products with cryptography that were previously granted transfers of
|commodity jurisdiction will remain under Department of Commerce control. Mass
|market software governed by this note is software that is generally available to
|the public by being sold from stock at retail selling points, without
|restriction, by means of over the counter transactions, mail order transactions,
|or telephone call transactions; and designed for installation by the user
|without further substantial support by the supplier.
[end exceptions]

|   (2) Cryptographic (including key management) systems, equipment, assemblies,
|modules, integrated circuits, components or software which have the capability
|of generating spreading or hopping codes for spread spectrum systems or
|equipment.
|   (3) Cryptanalytic systems, equipment, assemblies, modules, integrated
|circuits, components or software.
|   (4) Systems, equipment, assemblies, modules, integrated circuits, components
|or software providing certified or certifiable multi-level security or user
|isolation exceeding class B2 of the Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria
|(TCSEC) and software to certify such systems, equipment or software.
|   (5) Ancillary equipment specifically designed or modified for paragraphs (b)
|(1), (2), (3), (4) and (5) of this category;
|   (c) Self-contained diving and underwater breathing apparatus as follows:
and so on....

The list of exceptions to  section (b) is pretty long.  It should be
pretty easy to sell software that meets some these criteria, and surely
by describing ones software as a section 121.1-XIII(b) exception you
can avoid lots of trouble, not to mention forms.  At least until your
caught.

Further on, in section 121.8 they define "firmware" and "software" as:

|   (e) Firmware and any related unique support tools (such as computers,
|linkers, editors, test case generators, diagnostic checkers, library of
|functions and system test diagnostics) specifically designed for equipment or
|systems covered under any category of the U.S. Munitions List are considered as
|part of the end-item or component. Firmware includes but is not limited to
|circuits into which software has been programmed.
|   (f) Software includes but is not limited to the system functional design,
|logic flow, algorithms, application programs, operating systems and support
|software for design, implementation, test, operation, diagnosis and repair. A
|person who intends to export software only should, unless it is specifically
|enumerated in  121.1 (e.g., XIII(b)), apply for a technical data license
|pursuant to part 125 of this subchapter.

"includes but is not limited to" means they make anything be whatever they
want it to be.  Best not to be involved with these guys.  The definitions
are so loose that a flip-flop that's externally settable could be defined
as "cryptographic key components".

There is a section about "public domain" too.  Here is their definition: 

|   120.11 -- Public domain.
|   Public domain means information which is published and which is generally
|accessible or available to the public:
|   (1) Through sales at newsstands and bookstores;
|   (2) Through subscriptions which are available without restriction to any
|individual who desires to obtain or purchase the published information;
|   (3) Through second class mailing privileges granted by the U.S. Government;|
|   (4) At libraries open to the public or from which the public can obtain
|documents;
|   (5) Through patents available at any patent office;
|   (6) Through unlimited distribution at a conference, meeting, seminar, trade
|show or exhibition, generally accessible to the public, in the United States;
|   (7) Through public release (i.e., unlimited distribution) in any form (e.g.,
|not necessarily in published form) after approval by the cognizant U.S.
|government department or agency (see also  125.4(b)(13) of this subchapter);
|   (8) Through fundamental research in science and engineering at accredited
|institutions of higher learning in the U.S. where the resulting information is
|ordinarily published and shared broadly in the scientific community. Fundamental
|research is defined to mean basic and applied research in science and
|engineering where the resulting information is ordinarily published and shared
|broadly within the scientific community, as distinguished from research the
|results of which are restricted for proprietary reasons or specific U.S.
|Government access and dissemination controls. University research will not be
|considered fundamental research if:
|   (i) The University or its researchers accept other restrictions on
|publication of scientific and technical information resulting from the project
|or activity, or
|   (ii) The research is funded by the U.S. Government and specific access and
|dissemination controls protecting information resulting from the research are
|applicable.

What it says and what it means are totally different.  It is undefined
until taken to court.  It's not clear from what I see that there is any
penalty for violating the rules in the first place.  These are
regulations, you can obey them or not.  If not, they have to catch
you.  If you leave them alone, and they don't notice you, chances are
they'll leave you alone.  Going out of the way to try to meet these
regulations and file for permits is likely to become a Kafkaesk
nightmare (as the Snuffel author is finding out).

The whole mess refers to itself and to other Government branches'
regulations.  It is most likely inconsistent because it is attempting
to be complete (Godel!).  It is probably wiser to let them try to catch
you than to let them know you're doing something they might find
interesting.  Giving a bureaucrat something interesting is like setting
off a slow fused time bomb attached to a tar baby.  Without an army of
lawyers to do the work, it ain't worth the hassle.

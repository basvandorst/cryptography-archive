How to obtain an anonymous Internet account.

1.  Obtain a box at a mail receiving service with picture "ID" from your 
"employer."

2.  Call ATTMAIL at (800) 242-6005, tell them you want an count for 
$3.00/month (billed) and give them you mail drop address.

3.  Wait 5 days for receipt of your account info.  Never visit the mail 
drop again.

4.  Log on to ATTMAIL at (800) 624-5123 from various public phones using 
the Konnex high speed acoutical coupler ($149.00).

5.  Crosspost your files widely to Email groups (with a request for 
further crossposting).  Send a copy to president@whitehouse.gov just for 
fun.

I'm sure that there are even easier ways but this is one.

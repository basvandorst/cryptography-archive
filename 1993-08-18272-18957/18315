Gosh, in a post earlier this month, Jim Bidzos of RSA said almost everyone
in the crypt community believes NSA has broken DES.  Dr. Denning must
know this too.  Why, then, this phrasing?  Is it a ;)  ?

NB. This was NOT done.  Nor will it ever as we proceed to...

IE. The Department of Spying on Everybody Department wishes to make
sure they can continue to be the Department of Spying on Everybody Department.

...was that Tom Jefferson who just climbed out of his grave?

Wasn't it a Dr. Denning that said secrecy of algorithms should NOT be
used to build secure cryto?  History certainly indicates this.  Is all
of our crypto based on a house of cards?

Well, gosh and golly, I'll guess I'll have to trust you on this :)
You and the other government picked experts...

Hardly majority rules.  In fact, the way most newsgroup votes have
gone recently, the term "rubber stamp" would be more appropriate.

I was referring to the fact that it would be wise to vote down this
newsgroup name and wait six months (per The Guidelines), then come
back with the more appropriately-named talk.politics.crypt at that
time.  No discussion is so terribly important that major mistakes have
to be made in the course of facilitating that discussion.

Back in the old days, there used to be enough people around the net
who cared enough to bring errors such as this to the forefront while
the discussion period was going on.  I'm basically sick of having to
repeat why this is no longer the case, so I won't.  Go back and read
my previous articles in this thread.  Just as a very prominent
example, a newsgroup with a 16-character namespace component was
proposed, and not a single person bothered to point out that 14
characters has traditionally been accepted as the limit until well
into the voting period.  Thankfully, that newsgroup never came into 
existence.

When enough people eventually realize what a mistake this name was,
and they will, you will thank me for bringing this to your attention
when I did.

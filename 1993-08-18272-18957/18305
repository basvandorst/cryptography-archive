Nonsense.  Of course the strength of the algorithm doesn't depend on
whether it's classified - it's as strong or as weak as it is regardless.
Our ability to *trust* it is substantially affected by classification,
but if you're stuck with the silly algorithm anyway, 
declassifying it might make it weaker, but can't make it any stronger :-)
Declassifying it *may* provide faster implementations, or better
techniques for breaking it, depending on its inherent strength.

I notice the references only discussed the strength of SkipJack,
not of the chip itself, including issues like whether the wiretap key
can be leaked out without the escrow agents' help, or whether there
was anything beyond their extremely narrow focus that is a security risk.

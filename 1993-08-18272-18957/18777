Well, the hard part in these schemes is usually keeping A from adjusting
the alleged choice of p and q once B has called "heads" or "tails" in your
example.  For instance, just using small numbers, if I'm A I could wait and
not pick any p and q until B makes their choice known.  Let's say B claims
"heads iff p > q".  Now if I want B to get "heads" I say "OK, p was 5 (=1
mod 4) and q was 3 (=3 mod 4) - you got heads.  If I want B to get "tails"
I say "OK, p was 5 (=1 mod 4) and q was 7 (=3 mod 4) - you got tails".  In
your scheme I can precompute arbitrarily large pairs of primes to suit
either condition.

Any good scheme requires each side to reveal enough up front that cheating
by changing the supposed initial conditions after the fact is impossible,
or at least sufficiently computationally difficult, without giving away the
choice of heads or tails until the process is complete.

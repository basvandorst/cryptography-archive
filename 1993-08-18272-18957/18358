Two things:

1) If the "terrorists" believe that they already have a secure channel
   available (presumably in the form of clipper), then why would they
   bother to develop their own system?

2) If the "terrorists" do become concerned about the security of their
   channel, why would they limit themselves to Skipjack?  There are many
   crypto systems available which can have equal or better security and
   for which the source is available (e.g. RSAREF).

I'll help you.  The answer to the above two questions is that they would
either not be concerned about it or, once concerned, they would "do the
job right" and use a reliable crypto system.  Note that the phrase
"reliable crypto system" is relative.  Do you think that they will place
as much faith in the words of the US government as you do?

From the above, we see that your argument about national security
is totally vacuous.   Clearly, the effect of implementing the Clipper
program would be to make it at least a little bit harder for anyone
to eavesdrop on phone conversations.  How could this possibly help
law enforcement fight terrorists?

Actually, I can think of a way.  When the US government outlaws
non-approved crypto AND installs automated equipment for detecting
same, they will have a good way to track down terrorists who choose
to use their own crypto systems.

Of course, the definition of the word "terrorist" will be changed
at that time to mean: "anyone who uses non-approved crypto systems."

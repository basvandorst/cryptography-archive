If you can do this, why not take two pieces of hardware that scramble
and descramble the LEAF using a private key, and install one on each
phone?  Then the LEAF is encrypted outside your house, but the phones
don't know that. I guess you could just encrypt the digital stream
coming out of the phone, as well.  Or am I missing something?     --

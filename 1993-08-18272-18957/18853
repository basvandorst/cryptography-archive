   As I've said before, my biggest problem with Clipper is that key escrow
is *much* easier to break than even a relatively weak cipher, such as (say)
FEAL-8.  Indeed, I'd feel more secure using FEAL-8 in CFB-mode for my phone
conversations, with an independently generated random key for each use than
using a key-escrowed version of skipjack or triple-DES, because:
 
1.   For some amount of money, an individual key can be retrieved.  This
     amount is certainly less than te cost of a keysearch machine, and
     is probably less than the cost-per-keysearch of a keysearch machine.
 
2.   For a larger amount of money, time, and risk, a wealthy entity can
     compromise the key escrow database.  This need happen only once, and
     until it is discovered, this person retrieves all desired trafic
     *free*.
 
3.   Those entities likely to break a weak cipher will mostly be
     various governemnts' spy/comint agencies, who will probably have
     little interest in me (and little difficulty getting warrants or
     compromising the key-escrow database).  Anyone with a crooked judge
     and a crooked cop on the payroll can get a key from the escrow scheme.

The trouble is, you never know when you stop being "average".  Dr. Fielding
was an ordinary psychiatrist who suffered burglary by the Nixon White House.
It had nothing, per se, to do with him.  He just had the bad luck to be 
treating a patient the government was interested in, Daniel Elsberg.  Of course,
I'm sure they weren't gentle about sticking only to the Elsberg files.  I'm
sure they looked around to see, at least, who the good Doctor's other patients
were and who knows what else they looked into as long as they were there.
These were burglars, after all, and the risk was only incremental.

It is said that the average wedding or funeral has about 150 people in it.
So, Joe Average knows 150 people that, in some sense, really count.  If one
counts business relationships, this number probably rises to closer to
1,000 for most of us.  We probably are only 0-1 relationship links away
from some very notorious people, many of whom won't become notorious until
after the government does a lot of legwork.

That means, roughly, that all of us are at risk to be of at least intermittent
interest to any government agency that goes off the deep end and, once again,
spies upon its citizens (Watergate was, regretably, not an anomoly).

In general, you are of no interest.  But, on any given day, how can you be
sure?

Do you really want your privacy to be conditional in this manner?  And,
what if you come up with a controversial idea that you don't know is 
controversial until _after_ the government rifles the subdirectories of 
every computer account you have to get whatever irrelevant (but, damaging)
dirt they can on you?  Remember, they asked about Rober Bork's movie rental
habits and the store owner complied.  Since he didn't rent X-rated stuff, that
was the end of it.  But, are you _so_ ordinary that every nook and cranny of
your life could be freely exposed?  If you are, you are a minority, my friend.

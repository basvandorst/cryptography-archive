Well, I thought I was the only one who put "Without Prejudice UCC 1-207"
on all his signatures.

Nice to meet another.

Has it made any real difference to you? I had one bank teller tell me
that she could not accept my paycheck with a conditional endorsement
on it. I told her to talk to her legal department. Only hassle yet
(been doing it for 2 years).

REPEAL THE UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE! RETURN US TO CONSTITUTIONAL LAW,
NOT EXECUTIVE REGULATION!

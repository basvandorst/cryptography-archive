Assuming the chip's physical and electronic protections we've heard about
here are maintained, I'd strongly disagree. Presumably our classified
algorithms for handling classified traffic are still secure, even if some of
the keys were compromised by spies.

In fact, I disagree so strongly that I'd bet a good dinner in my city of
residence (currently Los Angeles/Pasadena) on it, transportation excluded.

We'd have to particularize "eventually someone will" though. As presented
your assertion is untestable since you include the possibility of bad guys
getting the algorithm but not telling anyone else.

How true! What else might be classified as "munitions"? In Switzerland, so it
has transpired, automobile air-bags are so classified and require a permit
from the "Eidgenossiche Schiesspulververwaltung", the dread federal gunpowder
agency. As it happens, the nitrogen gas generator is fired by a trigger made
from  .... yes ... gunpowder!!! and so the airbag is "munitions".

The classification of RSA and similar items as "munitions" is no less silly,
and no less serious, but as Mr. X points out, it could cost more than it's
worth to defend yourself against such silliness.

Cheers!

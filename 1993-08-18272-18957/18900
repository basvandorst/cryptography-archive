This is a natural consequence of the group creation guidelines: to wit,
we can't change the group name in mid-vote. That's why there's a month 
of discussion before any vote---to settle issues such as the name.

Weren't you aware of the talk.politics.crypto request for discussion?
Did you expect that remaining silent for a month, and bringing up your
pet peeves after it was too late to change anything, would be an 
effective way to bring down this group? If any fanatic were able to
singlehandedly destroy a group proposal by resorting to such underhanded
tactics, then the discussion period would serve no purpose. I'd like to
believe that you have more respect for the group creation process.

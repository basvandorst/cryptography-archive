I doubt Skipjack will be revealed via chip analysis.  When it is revealed,
it will probably come from human frailties, not technological.

Yeah, but many more people are interested in having secure cryptosystems
than are interested in spy transmissions.  This newsgroup is proof of
the interest level.

For whom?

The "bad guys" won't tell us when they get Skipjack.  But the "good guys" will 
post it behind cryptographically secure anonymous remailers when it
comes into their hands.

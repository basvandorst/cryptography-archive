The other nice thing about AmEx, in my experience, is that they ask
different questions which may have variable answers.  Sometimes they
ask me to describe a purchase I've made recently, the number of 
additional cards I have on my account, or the number of extra services
(like their credit-card insurance service, or their frequent-flyer program)
attached to my card.  Hearing the answer to just one or two of these
questions (particularly the first one) is not necessarily going to be
very helpful to a would-be thief.

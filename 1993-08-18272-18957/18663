The Iraquis' were the "enemy or our enemy" in the 80's (Battle Field
Proven via Iran), and received alot of support from the US and others. 
In 1988-89 they sent Communications Officers around the world to find
good Comsec Equipment for general and very specific applications.  They
were competent and understood many of the neuances involved. One
application  was for a secure paging system, something Washington had
turned down a few years before. They awarded a large contract (>$10M) for
various Comsec Equipments in 1988/9 to a small US Company.  This company
had fielded equipment (at least for testing) in Iraqui prior to that, and
 tried unsuccessfully several times to get permission to ship the
equipment in 1990, both directly and through another country, just before
the Kuwait Invasion.   I have to believe this was not their only
supplier, as they indicated they also had Swiss equipment.

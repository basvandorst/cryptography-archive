pdc@dcs.ed.ac.uk (Paul Crowley) asks why feedback causes short loops.

A 64-bit block cipher E(M,K) maps 64-bit values to other 64-bit values.
Hopefully it maps input to output 1 to 1 with no correlation, i.e., for
all values of input 0..2**64-1 you will get as output all values
0..2**64-1 in a scrambled order.

Let's model this concept with a "perfect" 64-bit block cipher built by
creating a lookup table of 2**64 elements. Initialize each element with
its ordinal value. Shuffle each element with another element chosen at
random using a hardware RNJ based on quantum events. You now have a
lookup table with 1 to 1 mapping and no correlation. Look up element 0.
element 0 points to element n. Element n points to another element and
so on. But the odds are extremely slim that all the elements are chained
together in one long loop. In reality there are probably many smaller
loops, e.g. a-->b-->c-->a.

If your cipher E(M,K) has only one loop it is likely there is a
significant level of correlation that can be exploited since the odds
are so slim that the cipher has only one loop by chance. This is why
using a counter to step through consecutive elements is superior to
using feedback - it guarantees that you will not get stuck in short
loops, which are bound to exist in "good" block ciphers.

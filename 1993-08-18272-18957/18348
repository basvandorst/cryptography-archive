One suggestion I've seen (dunno what the REAL plan is) is to include a fee
in the price of the Clipper chip for this. Sounds right to me, on the "user
pays" argument.

Markey has held hearings. It's not at all clear, though, whether absent some
back-door method (filibuster, withholding of funds) the legislature has any
authority to forbid the executive to release Clipper on the basis proposed.

Sure. That's the whole point--to deny them non-escrowed Clipper which is
designed to be very strong. They then have to use weaker systems (one
assumes) which the good guys can then read (one hopes).

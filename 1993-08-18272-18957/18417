That is the whole point - FEAR - isn't it?  That our government, in the
"land of the free", has figured out that Constitutional protections are
not worth the paper they are written on, if they can simply use "civil
actions" to circumvent those protections, and with unlimited resources,
harass the individual(s) into oblivion.

Get a decision against the government action?  THey just appeal, and
you go through the whole excercise again.  On YOUR dime. Toss in countless
motions for delays which hurt the individual, but are an advantage to
government, and most people effectively has no recourse.  And there
always is the possibility of some "unfortunate" incident to happen to
kill the person(s) targeted, if they are enough of an annoyance (a
"suicide", the attempts to kill Weaver, the successful killing of the
BD's in Waco - yes, I believe the government agents intended for them
to be killed, from day one, and other such incidents in the past).

The whole purpose of all this?  To instill FEAR, and to INTIMIDATE.
Government can eliminate a lot of headaches regarding their abuses
via fear and intimidation.  Just like all those governments our top
officials like to give nasty and name-calling speeches about...

Motive?  To increase dominion over the population.  Freedom and Big
Government are about as conflicting sets of goals as one can come up
with..

  Of course, only a paranoid would expect the opposition to have two avenues
of attack, so that they can fall back on Plan B in the event that Plan A
isn't working out.

  If so, either the Pentagon should be emptied (if the people working there
are _not_ making exactly that assumption, they should be immediately sacked
for gros incompetence) or converted to a lunatic asylum (if the people working
there _are_ making that assumption, they are, according to the wisdom of DS,
paranoid).

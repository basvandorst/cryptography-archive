I'm afraid that you aren't going to find many folks famaliar with the
internal workings of the device willing to disclose this particular
information. Most who were certified in COMSEC are routinely debriefed
when they "part company" with the government and sign binding
non-disclosure agreements for revealing certain aspects of operations.
 
For what it's worth, KY-28s are way oudated.

The unkeyed physical device is simply a controlled item, much like
M-16 rifles, per se.  I believe a separate category now exists which
is dubbed CCI (Controlled Cryptographic Item), which makes the
hardware itself an accountable item only. However, a keyed device
carries the classification equivalent of the key that it is
employing at the time. For example, if the key is certified for
passing SECRET traffic, then the device is similarly classified.

Yes.

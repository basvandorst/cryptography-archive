/They thought of this too.  I was told last month by a knowledgable source

That means about the same thing as a John Doe warrant.  Either that or
a rubber-stamp warrant.  No way can the judge satisfy himself that the
cause for the warrant is legitimate and sufficient.  All the FBI, or
other "authorized government agency" need do is SAY it is legitimate
and BINGO!  Instant warrant.

Kinda defeats the whole idea of requiring warrants in the first place.
Why doesn't Big Brother and FearlessHeroGloriousLeader Clinton just
dispense with the pleasant fiction that there is going to be any
meaningful protection of the privacy of US Citizens ... er .. subjects.

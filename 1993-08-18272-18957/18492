Hardly surprising to see the new Administration hasn't made much "change" from 
their predecessors.  It *is* nice to see that they consider that it would be
"imprudent", though I'd certainly prefer terms like "it would be wrong" or
"exceeds our Constitutional authority" or other recognition of moral
or legal dimensions to the discussion.  But it's a start.

However, a Republican administration could follow this up in a year or so with
"he was out of the loop" or "plausible deniability".
The Democrats will probably treat this more like their sex-in-the-military 
policy and come out with a "Don't ask, don't tell" rule :-)

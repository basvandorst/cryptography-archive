Are 'clipper' phones just suposed to talk to other clipper phones? I seem
to have lost this part of the thread. In the UK there has been alot of people
taping the cellular phone conversations and various groups suggest that you
need to go digital with encryption to stop this. But in this case, the
encryption would only be between the phone and the cell base station with
normal phone links to the phone network. In this case back doors into
the mobile phone encryption isn't needed. 

Do these clipper phones work this/are ISDN?

Pete.

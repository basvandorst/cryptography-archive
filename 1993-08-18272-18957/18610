I might just mention in passing that this might well be true.  As I
understood it [and in truth I haven't been involved in the crypto world
for a fair number of years now, so I'm a bit out of touch], the Skipjack
algorithm was fairly closely related to some of the [!very! classified!]
algorithms used in the 'real' crypto gear.  While you may think that
there's no good reason to keep crypto information secret, NSA certainly
doesn't agree and they're *VERY* paranoid about the prospect of some of
their crypto system expertise leaking out.  It could well be hard
to disentangle it all and provide an appropriately sanitized unclassified
version.

It *could* put NSA in a very unfortunate position: if they really did
use a version of one of their super-strong, classified algorithms to
make the civilian-available algorithm quite strong and secure, and the
result is a series of legal challenges that threatens to compromise
classified crypto information.

Nope, they're not!  They use the same general protocol.  One of the fields
is called the PIN field....

In a related note, one of our customers requested that we place a register
in an airport, connected to the controlling system via a wireless link.
This system took credit cards at the register.  This system did  not
use any encryption.  Fortunately they decided against it, but
not for security reasons.  Makes me wonder where else my credit
card numbers are floating through the ehter.

The reason that I heard (hearsay) that Nintendo and other similar attempts
at copyrighting streams did not work, is is because if there is no other
waty to reproduce an effect  other than by using a particular pdata string
than the data string i snot copyrightable. In other words, I cannot copyright
the sequence to make the bell beep at a certain frequency, because anyone
desiring to make the bell beep at that frequency would _have_ to reinvent
that piece of code. While this doesn't appear to match the rest of copyright
laws it does make some kind of sense.

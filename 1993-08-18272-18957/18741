As a followup to my previous message, I see that Russell claims the escrow
system is trivial to defeat because:

"they can filter the encrypted stream"

uh, well, not quite--"this can be made more difficult by having hardware
systems test the field"

uh, well, "I suspect.."

uh, well, "Even allowing a "perfect" system, there is no way to prevent a
hostile from using multiple encryption systems before skipjack"

That doesn't sound trivial to me, and there are ways to check for that, too,
on the chip so that there's no "eavesdropping" going on.

So I'm still waiting to hear how it's "trivial" to break the escrow system.

:-)

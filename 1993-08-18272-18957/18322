In these financially tight days, has the administration released
estimates as to how much it will cost to setup and maintain this
escrow system that the Clipper/Skipjack system will use?  How much are
we going to pay to allow the government to maintain a library of all
the private keys?

Also, what is the legislative status of Clipper/Skipjack.  Is this
something that will be going in front of my congressmen and senators?
To whom would I write and voice an opinion on this topic?

(P.S. Don't the claims that the gov't isn't planning on prohibiting
other forms of encryption inconsistent with their claim that the use
of Clipper/Skipjack will assist law enforcement agencies?  Isn't it
reasonable to assume that if someone is engaged in an illegal, profit-
making enterprise would be willing to buy (perhaps at extra cost)
non-Clipper based encryption hardware?)

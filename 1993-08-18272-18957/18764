For SKIPJACK the reason for secrecy is real simple:  If anyone outside
the monopoly could make a SKIPJACK compatible telephone, they could
substitue random bits for the law enforcement field and defeat the
wire tap capabilities.  Instead, I'll have to build something that
reads the data-stream, picks out the LEAF, and does the substitution
on the fly.  Of course, they may have thought of that already and
decided to use the LEAF as the IV for the following data packet.

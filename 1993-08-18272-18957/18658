Actually, there's a third possibility, Mr. Murray and Mr. Sternlight:  the
escrow is so that decryption can be done cheaply in a reasonable time, not so
that it can be done at all. Few law enforcement agencies have either the iron or
the expertise to crack codes; OTOH, that's what the NSA does for a living. I
suspect that the "escrow" arrangement has been made for two reasons (which would
remain valid even if the NSA can crack the cipher in a reasonable time):

	- Even if there is capability to crack the cipher, the NSA does not
	  have the time, funding, etc. to do so, particularly in domestic case
	  (which they are prohibited from working on anyway). By having the
	  escrow, the NSA need not even get involved. Further, having the key 
	  enables one to solve a complicated cipher NOW, not in 10 days (or
	  whatever); this can be vital when combatting conspiracies.

	- By having the escrow, all that need to happen is that two law-enforce-
	  ment agencies have to convince each other that they need the info--
	  they don't have to get the NSA to help (for an unclassified example,
	  see THE CUCKOO'S EGG). This avoids another link in the chain, which
	  takes time.

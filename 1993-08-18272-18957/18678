I am not by any means an expert when it comes to DES and other encryption
schemes.  I am in fact quite new to this group's subject matter.  I am
interested in methods of cryptanalyzing DES.  I understand that an exaustive
key search would accomplish the task, but is there another way?  If the cypher-
text and the plaintext are known for a single block of data encrypted under a 
key K, can K be derived with the knowledge of the algorithm.  If not, how can
the knowledge of the plaintext and the cyphertext be used to find the key used
in the encryption process.

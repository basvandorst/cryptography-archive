    Even in the best of scenarios, that would mean that the original
warrant was unconstitutionally broad.  If the law enforcement agency
didn't have to go back to court to get a new warrant for each phone
involved, then the first warrant allow tapping of ALL Clipper phones,
wherever located.

    That brings up a very interesting point.  Assume that there is
evidence that someone paid an agent at one of the escrow agencies to
modify the escrow data for his phone so it couldn't be tapped.
Suppose also that this was a crime.  Under these circumstances, a
warrant for ALL keys held by both (or all) of the escrow agencies
might meet constitutional tests...

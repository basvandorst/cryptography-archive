   Has anyone done any work on finding IDEA key collisions?  I'm
interested in how difficult it is to find two 128-bit keys that
both convert some plaintext to some ciphertext.  I've read the
article "How easy is collision search?  Application to DES," by
Quisquater and Delescaille (Eurocrypt '89 procedings), and it
looks like the method used in that article would need some changes
to deal with the 128-bit keysize of IDEA.  Has anyone done any
work along these lines?

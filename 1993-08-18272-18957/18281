As it happens, this is very much like what is used in the newest
vesion of KA9Q NOS (as far as I've seen, currently only available in
RCS form, so perhaps it is not officially "availavble" yet). It
MD5s the concatenation of login name and password. This prevents
the system administrator from swapping or copying passwords around.

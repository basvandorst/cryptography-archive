	"They then have to use weaker systems"?
	           ^^^^

	You have no problem with folks using weaker systems like
RSA+IDEA, then? Apparently the government does, or would at least
like to discourage it.

	You're missing an important point: With some cryptosystems,
the strength of the system (barring breakthroughs in factoring, for
example) is well known, and if I ever think that computers are
getting fast enough to factor my keys, I'll use bigger ones. So I
*KNOW* the degree of security I'm getting. Sorry, but I don't
trust even Dorothy Denning's just telling me "it's OK" based on a
superficial analysis of something that purports to be skipjack.
Military intelligence is much more than just knowing something
about the enemy; it's also about knowing if what you know is
*accurate*.

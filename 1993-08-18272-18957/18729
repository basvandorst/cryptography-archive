I'm trying to find shift register taps other than the (64,4,3,1,0) that I
got from Numerical Recipies. I need anoother maximal length sequence with more
non-zero coefficients. I am using the parallel algorithm (i.e. xor with 64 bit word
and rotate left one bit). I would like as many as half of the coefficients to be non
zero, but I'd settle for just getting 1 or 2 in the upper 32 bits or better yet at least one in each byte. I'm trying to generate sequences in which many bits change on
each shift. I don't have access to Watson or even Peterson although, if I remember correctly, Peterson and Berlycamp just give the minimal tap polynomials in order
to conserve xor gates in the conventional SR implementation. Thanks for any help.

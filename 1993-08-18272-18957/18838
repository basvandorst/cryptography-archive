The IBM family of "Personal Security Card" smart cards provide DES encryption
and MAC services, as well as strong key management.  The crypto features
conform to the IBM "Common Cryptographic Architecture", also used in other
products.  Versions are available with modified functions suitable for
export where DES is not permitted.

The IBM 4754 reader is an intelligent, cryptographic device as well as a
smart card reader.  It established cryptographic sessions with the smart
card, used to transfer sensitive data where appropriate.  (A lower cost
reader without this sophistication is also available.)

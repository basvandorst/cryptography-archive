   A PC storing TS material sounds pretty much a contradiction in terms :-) 

MS-DOS is perfectly secure - there's only one User in the Universe,
and She's allowed to do anything She wants.  That's just fine for TS.
Of course, she'd better keep it locked in a safe when she's not using it :-)
(Obviously, a system with real accounting would be better, 
but physical access control will do, especially on floppy-only systems.)

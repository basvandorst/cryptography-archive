Olaf, you are a clever fellow, but you missed the difference between
THEORY and PRACTICE, the latter of which is a very important subfield of 
cryptography.

1.  Surely, any designer half awake (and, NSA is more than half awake)
   knows that an algorithm must be designed under the premise that it
   will become known (indeed, today it must resist full disclosure plus
   chosen plaintext attacks, including differential cryptanalysis or
   maybe more exotic stuff we haven't reinvented yet).

2.  However, just as surely, you don't (if you are NSA) publish
   the algorithm in the New York Times.  It may be a month, or it may be
   twenty years before the enemy manages to get a hold of a good enough
   description of the machine.  If you read the history of machine
   cryptography, there is an immense difference of the before and after
   efforts if the algorithm is fully known.  Almost often doesn't cut
   it anymore.

3.  Remember, too, that the key selection protocol is almost as important
   if not more so.  When the Germans adjusted their Enigma practices
   and England's Bombe's were not yet functioning, the British kept reading
   German traffic almost uninterrupted because they knew of the poor German
   key selection methods.  Only when the Germans improved their key selection
   methods were the allies in trouble.  Luckily, the bombes were ready by then.

"Practical" cryptanalysis means not giving up on "security by obscurity",
even if the cryptosystem design has conceded the point up front.

I'm not a big fan of the NSA, but it takes very little understanding of the
history to know why they are reluctant to expose things that their designers
must assume the enemy to know.  Kind of a belt-and-suspenders approach.

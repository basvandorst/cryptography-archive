Thanks to Dr. Denning for posting the interim report.  On a brief read-through,
I haven't got much substantive to say yet, so I'll depart from my
normal procedures and not say much :-)  Three concerns, though:
- While it's good that the whole system is being evaluated and not
	just Skipjack, I'm concerned about the propaganda value of
	releasing a report that says "the committee says it's just fine",
	while will presumably be abused in attempts to railroad
	standards committees into specifying Clipper.
- While the analysis looked at the design techniques for SkipJack
	and other classified algorithms, it did *not* address the issue of
	why, if SkipJack is so strong, it's only approved for unclassfied 
	material, while the other algorithms can be used for classified.
	Is it weaker in some way?  Key length alone doesn't count...
- Key length adequacy - DES can be brute-forced now, at substantial expense;
	two different designs have been published for ~$30M, 1-day search.
	The report makes a big deal about how 24 bits longer key means
	about 36 years longer life if computer power keeps doubling every
	1.5 years, though it's speculative how long that will continue,
	and makes a big deal about how 80-bit keys are unsearchable now.
	An 80-bit key is still vulnerable in most of our lifetimes;
	a 128-bit key really is not.

   Wasn't it a Dr. Denning that said secrecy of algorithms should NOT be
   used to build secure cryto?  History certainly indicates this.  
   Is all of our crypto based on a house of cards?

She's making another point here - this is using secrecy to prevent
*other* people from building secure crypto, not just to obscure
current crypto algorithms.  However, calling that "detrimental to
national security" would be blatant political propaganda.....

Realistically, though, there may have been design mistakes in current
crypto algorithms used for classified information; the NSA isn't
infallible, and they may have missed something.  And disclosing the
algorithm would increase the possibility of any mistakes being discovered.

   >However, while full exposure of the internal details of SKIPJACK would

I notice that this refers to "national security objectives" rather
than "national security", and doesn't say *who* set these objectives.

More later...

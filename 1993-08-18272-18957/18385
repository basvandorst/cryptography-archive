There's no registration of phones.  The gov't gets a wiretap order on a
phone number somehow associated with you. (a pay phone you pass
occasionally?)  They pick up a message.  They decrypt the LEAF and
learn the key's serial number and an encrypted message key.

1.	they write off to the escrow agencies, get that chip's master key
	and then use that master key for future traffic using that phone.

or, if they had been less blatant about the seecurity flaws, they might have
done it this way:

2.	they send the decrypted LEAF to the escrow agencies and get back
	the message key for the particular conversation.  What comes back
	from each escrow agency is an 80-bit key.  The FBI XORs those two
	together and that's the real message key.  This way, the FBI
	doesn't get access to a chip's master key.  (at least not according
	to the publicized procedure.)

Notice that the correlation between the chip serial number and the
valid court order presented to the escrow agencies is, shall we say,
not firmly established by the procedure as it's been explained so far.

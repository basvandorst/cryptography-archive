I thought it was said that having a 768 bit key (48 bits/round * 16 rounds)
would not make DES stronger.  It would actually make it weaker.  Differential
cryptanalysis is aided by independence of the bits.

This is different than saying that anything longer than 56 bits would not help.
The key can be longer, and still have plenty of dependence between key bits.
Did they actually say 56 bits is the maximum useful key length?

True, but a strong algorithm whose key is too short can be helped by a longer one.

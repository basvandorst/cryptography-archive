Sharp-eyed readers of the Interim Report will note that while
it does say that SkipJack:

> is representative of a family of encryption algorithms developed in
> 1980 as part of the NSA suite of "Type I" algorithms, suitable for
> protecting all levels of classified data. The specific algorithm,
> SKIPJACK, is intended to be used with sensitive but unclassified

and does argue that 80 bits is a secure key length, there is no 
claim that other "Type I" algorithms use so short a key.

The irony of it:  The SkipJack algoritm is not secure enough
to protect the SkipJack algoritm.

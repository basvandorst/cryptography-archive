I said "one of us misunderstands the other". That leaves the door open for
me to be the one who misunderstands, and your comment is both graceless and
wrong.

It's never safe to assume anything in a discussion of substance in which the
parties have fixed ideas amounting to religious beliefs, since some areas in
which party "A" has a fixed idea may not correspond to areas where party "B"
has a fixed idea. It IS possible, for example, to be both pro-choice and
anti-gun-control or vice-versa. I am on record as opposing strongly any ban
on non-Clipper crypto.

Nice straw man. You have said nothing to suggest that you don't think the
earth is flat, but I am not entitled to assume you do. As it happens I do
not advocate a government monopoly of all meaningful power in this country.
That's your ideologically polarized mind at work.

Sure. I think people have very strong rights to privacy, except when they
come into conflict with other people's rights. Then a resolution mechanism is
required (can you say law and courts?) To take a simple example, you can't
sell dope out of your house and then claim your right to privacy means the
police can't get and execute a search warrant on probable cause.

I don't think people should have the right to decide for themselves when
force is necessary. Mugging IS illegal. The Constitution and the law are
very careful on this point.

Prove a negative. Cute, Pat, cute.

So what?

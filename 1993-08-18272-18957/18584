Probably standard Unix blocks (1024 bytes), which would give you 128
code blocks.  As a previous poster suggested, it seems that a mode such
as PCBC that propagates changes through all subsequent cipher blocks
would be most appropriate here.

: encrypting the previous file block's last ciphertext block.

I don't have a place for an IV field for each block in the file
structure, I guess I'll have to live with something less optimal.

:    If you're going to have a passphrase, you may as well use it as strongly
: as possible.  Maybe you could generate the MD5 hash of the passphrase, and
: encrypt that with the hardware key, or vice-versa.

Right!  I should have said XORed with a hashed pass phrase.

I am _very_ enamored of the zero-knowledge schemes.  The big problem is
that they require hardware keys.  You enter a pin number which only your
key knows and will never be released from the box, you are issued a challenge
which you key into your box, which (if the proper pin has also been entered)
gives you a valid, identifying response.

The disadvantage is that some sort of scheme which would allow multiple
vendors to use the same box for ID would have to be worked out--or you'd
end up carrying a box around for each credit card, bank ATM, employer ID,
etc., etc., etc.  (Of course, electronics continue to get smaller and smaller,
the box I've seen is too unwieldy for a wallet but wouldn't be bad for a
purse--eventually your credit cards, etc., etc. might have all the guts
in them including an itty-bitty-non-ergonomic-keyboard).

BTW:  with regard to SSN as identifying numbers, the major credit reporting
agencies actually have assigned a much longer number as an ID key, apparently
because of the problems with using SSN as a database key.  (At least my last
credit report that I obtained from TRW had an ID number clearly identified at
the top of the report).

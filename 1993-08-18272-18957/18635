We ought not to estimate the ability of the NSA at all.

Tremendous amounts of time, effort and bandwidth have
been wasted by people making unsubstantiated guesses at
what the NSA can do.  No useful results yet.

We shouldn't be trying do design systems that the NSA can't
break.  We should be trying to design systems that no one
can break.

The open literature is the only source of whorthwile 
cryptographic knowlege available.

I don't mean to attack the above post, which is of some
historical interest.  But the open literature has advanced
cryptology into a whole new world since 1945.  Also, the NSA 
did not exist as such until 1952 (not that I really care).

We may have to oppose the NSA on political matters.  On 
technical matters we should ignore them, since they will
not provide any help in advancing the science.  Let them
do their job, we'll do ours.

My two cents.

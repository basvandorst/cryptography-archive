Or choose a common word and use a pattern on the keyboard to disguise it.
Example: choose the word "albatross", but type the key to the top right
of each letter, except for the last letter where you type the actual letter.

So for "albatross", your password is "wphw650es". Does that appear in
anyone's dictionary?

Easy to remember words and patterns - "bullyons and bullyons" of possibilities
and you don't have to be racist!!

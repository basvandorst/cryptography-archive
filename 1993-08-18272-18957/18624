I like Grady's suggestion, especially the won't-write-it-down idea, but there is a
catch.  Suppose everybody adopts his approach?

Then the NSA won't have to waste any cycles trying words from their Albanian
dictionary or checking for shifted patterns on keyboards.  This leaves lots of
cycles to try shocking nonsense.

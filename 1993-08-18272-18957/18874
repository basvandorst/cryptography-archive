Before I comment on this, allow me to state that Dan's remarks, which
are atrributed above, are far from the first time that this exact same 
attitude has been stated by someone in defense of their proposed 
newsgroup.  In fact, it's not even the first time *THIS MONTH* that I 
have seen this exact same thing occur on the net.  The "This newsgroup
must come into existence *NOW* and Death to the Infidel Pagan Mongrel
Dog who dares oppose this Sacred Edict" attitude really needs to
change, and fast.  This is why we're supposed to have a newsgroup
creation process, so that the net may discover what's wrong with an
idea and to judge its viability.

Now, onto my point.  Badly needed?  Maybe.  Poorly named?  Definitely.  
It's not entirely Dan's fault, though;  as I've stated numerous times, 
the entire newsgroup creation process has become one of ignoring 
genuine concerns related to individual proposals and focusing on flame 
wars over whatever is fashionable to carry on flame wars about this 
time around.

Yes, I surely took a hint a long time ago.  One person's poorly-named
or poorly-conceived newsgroup idea becoming reality because the net
was asleep or busy with some meaningless flame war is the sort of
thing that's gone on for entirely too long now, and really needs to
stop before it becomes the standard way of creating newsgroups.  This
is why I took the time to post my earlier article.  And naturally, I
receive the standard response from its proponent: "Stop interfering
with my wonderful idea!"  None of these people bother to realize that
these wonderful ideas are perhaps not so wonderful in reality, and
maybe need some work before they are actually put into existence.  The
creation of a newsgroup involves actual man-hours on the part of many
people.  Making things harder on the many to satisfy the few is just
plain ridiculous.

One person's fanaticism over an individual concept and the sleeping
acquiescence of the net does not a mandate make.  Unfortunately, in
some circumstances, it has caused a few newsgroups to come into
existence.

Anyway, let's all put a stop to this poor newsgroup name, as it's
going to encourage other people to push their poorly-named newsgroup
ideas onto the net:

Vote NO on talk.politics.crypto

And BTW, Dan: Seeing as how your name appears on the CFVs, couldn't
your following up to my earlier article and generally advocating your
newsgroup idea, possibly be construed as "campaigning?"  I'm not 
going to make a big deal out of it, other than to suggest that perhaps 
the newsgroup creation process is somewhat lost on you after all.  If
it is, please read The Guidelines sometime before the close of the
vote.

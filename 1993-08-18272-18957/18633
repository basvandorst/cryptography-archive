It is Anderson's field. He has explained in a long earlier post that
there is a true PIN-- which is derived from various info like you acct #--
and a secondary PIN which you type in. On the card's magnetic stripe is
an offset which tells the ATM what to subtract from your PIN to get the
true PIN.
I think the N Amer. situation is not quite so bad as he describes the
British. The banks here seem more willing to believe the customer ( or
am I just living in a dream world).

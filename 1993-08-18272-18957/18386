If Congress is unwilling to honestly remove an authorization (such as that
under which Clipper is based), but instead removes funds, it is certainly a
back door. It also lacks any integrity.

What often happens is that Congress says the Administration should do thus
and so (which is politically popular) but refuses funds for it (because some
in Congress are opposed and can make their case stick). Then they're "on
record" as being in favor of it (thus allowing them to posture in front of
the voters), but actually kill it. In some of the more egregious cases of
political mendacity, some have even attacked the administration for
subsequently not doing it. (By the way, this is not a partisan matter--both
Republicans and Democrats have done it.)

Recall that in Congress, the authorization process and the appropriation
process ar not the same.

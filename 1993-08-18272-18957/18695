I hate to admit it, but I actually think DS has a point. We don't
really know whether NSA can "easily" crack DES -- as opposed to
mounting brute force attacks, which we know from simple arithmetic
they *can* do within their budget when required. But NSA's insistence
on keeping Skipjack classified despite the widespread availability of
DES makes just a little more sense if you assume that they can in fact
crack DES with only modest effort.

Well, let's see...there's something called Congress that actually
tasked NIST with this mission, not NSA. With a law, not just a policy
directive.  And the law specifically limited NSA to a "technical
advisory" role, which NSA has clearly turned on its head -- as the
CPSR FOIA effort on DSS has repeatedly demonstrated.

Given NSA's demonstrated ability to ignore the law with impunity even
when it's clear to everyone that they're doing so, what makes you
believe they're any more likely to respect the law in private, behind
their veils of secrecy?

For themselves and the rest of the government, yes. But the good
(COMSEC) side of NSA has always taken a back seat to the dark (SIGINT)
side when it comes to crypto for us mere mortals.

They may have remarked on it, but I have yet to see anything but
hysterical hand-waving, not a pattern of actual cases.

This is not at all clear. A basic principle of modern crypographic
theory as described by Shannon way back in the late 1940s is that
iterated combinations of several cryptosystems, each of which may be
trivially breakable, can produce "product" ciphers that are far
stronger than the sum of their components. So even if NSA can break
plain DES with anything significantly less than brute force (which
isn't necessary, given their vast resources), it does not at all
follow that they can almost as easily crack triple DES.

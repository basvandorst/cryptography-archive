   Do you really think that it's possible for NSA to keep it secret

Yes, I do think it possible.  Differential cryptanalysis was kept secret
until independently rediscovered.  I agree, it would be a major
discovery.

A secret which was kept for decades, despite being known by many
thousands of people, was that of the activities of Bletchley Park about
50 years ago.

A *superb* book has just been published in the UK.  Called
"Codebreakers" (now where have I head that title before?) it consists of
perhaps 20 chapters, each by an ex-worker at BP during the war.  There
are real technical details in there, as well as reminiscences.

Sorry this review is far too vague: I got my copy only 2 days ago and I
don't have it on me, so I can't quote ISBN etc.  If there's enough
interest, I'll get the full biblio details.

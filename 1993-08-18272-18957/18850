I am responsible for publicity on the Inter-net of a conference to be held
in
Phoenix (Az) Nov 8 thru 12th of this year.  The working title is: Joint
Experts Meeting on Authentication and Privacy for Personnel Communicatons
Systems Air Interface.  The meeting is sponsored by Telelocator (a PCS
industry group), TR46 (a standards body associated by the TIA) and T1P1
(another standards body assiciated with ECSA).  

Given the traffic on this group, I thought some of the people who should
attend the meeting would be readers.  I am trying to size the number of
people who will attend, so I can make the necessary reservations for
meeting rooms.

If you'r interested in attending or request to receive the announcement by
e-mail, please replay to this message.  I'll collect responses for my own
use in planning and send you the more detailed announcement by return mail.

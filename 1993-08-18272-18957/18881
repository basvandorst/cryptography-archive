With reference to Sean Patrick Ryan's message and comments on it, I can't
believe that a single NO vote can postpone the creation of a newsgroup for
six months. Isn't it "majority rules" or some such? To give any single user
a veto is nutty.

As for Sean's right during a request for discussion to advocate a different
name, that's fine. Once there's a CFV though, I'd have thought discussion
would be over and an anti-community action such as persisting in pro or con
advocacies graceless if not boorish.

Finally, if Sean doesn't like the name, and wants to vote no over that
issue, I think it's his business. To make a net.cause over it, though, seems
to me to be juvenile.

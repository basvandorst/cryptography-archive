In a perusal of a recently-discovered undated monograph "Crypto-fauna
of the Northern Hemisphere" in the Library of Congress written by a 
hitherto unknown assistant of Charles Darwin (Sir Edmund X.O.R. 
Rotor-Wheel), the following excerpts of possible interest to the
sci.crypt readership were noted by your faithful servant:
 
> Cryptoadia governmentalis -- a reclusive member of the amphibious
> family Cryptoadia distinguished by avoidance of light and the produc-
> tion of lengthy and convoluted but repetitious mating songs.  Because
> many specimens of C. governmentalis have such poorly articulated 
> cephalic features, they are sometimes designated as "faceless".  
> Functioning acephalic specimens have also been reported. 
 
> Cryptoadia academicus -- (sometimes Cryptoadia academicus obscurantis)
> cloistered members of the family Cryptoadia.   One subspecies Cryptoadia
> academicus spookia is distinguished by its mimicry of the coloration 
> and mating calls of C. governmentalis.   
 
According to Sir Edmund, differentiating C. spookia and C. governmentalis 
on the basis of coloration and mating calls is a daunting taxonomic feat.

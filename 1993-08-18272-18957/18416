      "Man in the middle" attacks are not fundamentally undetectable.

      First, it's possible to detect a "man in the middle" if you have more
than one path between the ends and there is not tight coordination between
the eavesdroppers on both paths.  Just send some cyphertext for one path
on the other path, as a check.

      Second, if you're using a block cypher, the "man in the middle"
can't send a block until he receives a full block.  Thus, an eavesdropper
must introduce delay.  If both ends have synchronized clocks, the
receiver can detect that an eavesdropper is tampering with the link.

      Third, if you attempt to authenticate your data by occasionally sending,
as a check, something depending on previously sent cyphertext
as part of the plaintext, the "man in the middle" is forced to start
modifying the plaintext as well as the cyphertext.  Eventually, the
"man in the middle" has to take over the conversation and completely
pretend to be the other party to hold up the illusion, or give up
and break the connection.

       "Oh, what a tangled web we weave" applies here.  You can force the
"man in the middle" to have to do arbitrarily difficult things to keep the
illusion going.  Unless the attacker is equipped to completely fake a
conversation, he can be detected.

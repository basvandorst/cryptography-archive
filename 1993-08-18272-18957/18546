                           CALL FOR PAPERS
   
1994 IEEE Symposium on                              May 16--18, 1994
Research in Security and Privacy                    Oakland, California
  
                             sponsored by
  IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Security and Privacy
                         in cooperation with
    The International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR)

The Symposium on Security and Privacy is the premier forum for the
presentation of developments in computer security, and for bringing
together researchers and practitioners in the field.  The focus of
this, the 15th symposium in the series, will include technical aspects
of security and privacy as they arise in commercial and industrial
applications, as well in government and military systems.  The
symposium will address advances in the theory, design, implementation,
analysis, and application of secure computer systems, and in the
integration and reconciliation of security and privacy with other
critical system properties such as reliability and safety.  Topics in
which papers and panel session proposals are invited include, but are
not limited to, the following:

Secure systems    Privacy Issues  Access controls  Security verification
Network security  Policy modeling Information flow Authentication
Database security Data integrity  Protocols        Viruses and worms
Auditing and intrusion detection  Commercial and industrial security
Security and other critical system properties      Distributed systems

INSTRUCTIONS TO AUTHORS:

Send six copies of your paper and/or proposal for a panel session to
John Rushby, Program Co-Chair, at the address given below.  Papers and
panel proposals must be received by November 15, 1993.  Papers, which
should include an abstract, must not exceed 7500 words.  The names and
affiliations of the authors should appear on a separate cover page
only, as a ``blind'' refereeing process is used.  Authors must certify
prior to December 31, 1993 that any and all necessary clearances
for publication have been obtained.

Papers must report original work that has not been published
previously, and is not under consideration for publication elsewhere.
Abstracts, overlength papers, electronic submissions, late
submissions, and papers that cannot be published in the proceedings
will be rejected without review.  Authors will be notified of
acceptance by February 1, 1994.  Camera-ready copies are due not later
than March 15, 1994.

Panel proposals should describe, in two pages or less, the objective
of the panel and the topic(s) to be addressed.  Names and addresses of
potential panelists (with position abstracts if possible) and of
the moderator should also be included.

The Symposium will also include informal poster sessions where
preliminary or speculative material, and descriptions or
demonstrations of software, may be presented.  Send one copy of your
poster session paper to Cristi Garvey, at the address given below, by
January 31, 1994, together with certification that any and all
necessary clearances for presentation have been obtained.

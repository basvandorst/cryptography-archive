Here's a brief but interesting passage in an AP wire story I saw today
regarding American intelligence during the air war in the Gulf:

           ``The intelligence agencies had an excellent handle on the
	units, locations and equipment of Iraqi troops _ but not the
	numbers of troops _ deployed to face coalition forces,'' the report
	said, despite good Iraqi communications security.

I also heard the same thing in an NPR report this morning, though it's
possible they got it from the AP.

This might be a story to watch to see if we can find out what was meant
by "good Iraqi communications security". Perhaps they were using a public
domain DES? :-)

I had spoken several years ago to someone claiming to be the president of a 
firm in Belleview, NB (or thereabouts) that housed several ex-cryptographers
who built an optical computer that can break into other computers and crack c
codes by learning the "structure" of the target (machine or code) in an 
optical domain.  That is, it translates its interaction with a computer into
an interaction of graphic symbols that permit the machine to reason how to 
ultimately manipulate the computer.   As I was told, they tested it one night
on some supposedly inaccessible government computer and by morning had the 
target machine locked up.  Their facility was immediately visited by FBI 
agents.  Soon after this event, their entire operation went classified and
I lost contact.  I tossed away their phone number.  Now I regret it.

Does anybody know of this firm?  I have a client who could use their technology.

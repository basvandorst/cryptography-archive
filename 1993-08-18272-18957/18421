   Hmmm.  I haven't seen the algorithms to RC2 or RC4 published here, though
there's been a fair amount of talk about them, they're implemented in
software, and PKP's lawyers are *much* less intimidating that the US Gov't's
Justice Dept., when trying to make an example of someone.
 
   I suspect that many foreign intelligence services will succeed in getting
the algorithm back out, but I'd be quite surprised if someone published
Skipjack.  Certainly, doing so in the US would lead to some nasty
consequences.  And somehow, I don't think an anonymous remailer would keep
your identity secret from the FBI or NSA, if they were interested in looking
for you.
 
   Doesn't NSA have other classified encryption schemes, used for classified
military data?  How many of those have been published recently?  I'm sure
everyone on this list would be interested in seeing how recently-designed
algorithms from the NSA work, and trying to tease out of their structure
any information we can about what the NSA knows and we don't.

I like this idea.  You can get a more readable image by using pairs of

#        #
 #  and #

which almost XOR properly when held up to the light.  You needn't
*really* use an OTP, of course; you could use IDEA to generate the
random data, and so long as you only use each random vector once you
get all the security of IDEA.  The point is, if I can solve the key
distribution problem I can exchange information in absolute security
with people who don't have computers.

Of course, they'll have to be fairly accurate in matching up the pieces
of paper...

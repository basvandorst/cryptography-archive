===========================================================================
	I generally take much greater care in responding to email than
in my responses on newsgroups.  I have a tendency to get -- shall we say
'overly excited' when I read something I find personally offensive, and
I usually wind up regretting it.  That's bad on a newsgroup.  But my
mailbox is sort of like my home.  I have also gotten quite a bit of
hate mail after postings requesting action on Gary Graham case, or
when I called someone "a fool and a racist" concerning their use of
a racial slur -- even regarding immigration policy.  I've decided that
it just isn't worth responding to hate mail, since it just generates
another reply.  By the way, does anyone know of an Internet self-help
group for people with a tendency to flame?  I don't want to think I'd
be the first member.
	Since this isn't a privacy issue, I suggest we take it off
this newsgroup.  I also don't know where they should go.  I'll 
welcome non-flame response via mail.

Sincerely,
Etan Ben-Ami

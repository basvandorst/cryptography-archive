  I'm sure that many have access to the original paper. I just looked
up mine and here is what the first page says.

A Method for Obtaining Digital signature and Public-Key Cryptosystms *

Abstract

    We present an encryption method with the novel property that 
publicly revealing an encryption key does not thereby reveal the 
corresponding decryption key.  This has two important consequences:

(1)   Couriers or other secure means are not needed to transmit keys, since 
a message can be enciphered using an encryption key publicly revealed by 
the intended recipient.  Only he can decipher the message, since only 
he knows the corresponding decryption key.

(2) A message can be "signed" using a privately-held decryption key.  
Anyone can verify this signature.  This has obvious applications in 
"electronic mail" and "electronic funds transfer" systems. 

    A message is encrypted by representing it as a number M, raising M, 
to a publicly-specified power e, and the taking the remainder when the 
result is divided by teh specified product n of two large secret prime 
numbers p and q. Decryption is similar; ony a different secret, power d 
is used where e*d = l(mod(p-l)*(q-l)).  The security of the system rests 
in part on the difficulty of factoryin the published divisor, n.

Key words and phrases: digital signatures, public-key cryptosystems, 
privacy, authentication, security, factorization, prime number, 
electronic mail, message-passing, electronic funds transfer, 
cryptography.

Any spelling mistakes in the above should be assumed to be purely my own.

Obviously since the original RSA research was created through Government
grant's in the first place one, myself, wonders what the H* a private
corp. is doing holding a patent on it.

 Also note in paragraph (2) where the authors note that this technique
has "obvious applications in e-mail and electronic funds transfer". It
again  seems that this is so obvious a use that it could not possibly
be patentable.

 Interestingly the patents do not note that the DOD, specifically
the Navy, also has an interest in the work. Is this a significant
oversite?

It just does a bit of bit-bashing.  He sent me the source code about a week
ago when he originally posted to comp.sys.amiga.programmer, he'll probably
send you a copy if you ask him for it.  However since the cipher itself is
just a modified polyalphabetic, and since the code was in (mostly uncommented)
68K assembly language, I didn't go into the password-mangling code in any
detail, but just directed him to Kahn which explains the background of this
type of cipher fairly well.  You could also try "Cryptology yesterday, today,
and tomorrow" by various people whose names escape me, which is an anthology
of Cryptologia articles and contains various interesting bits of information
on solving polyalphabetics.

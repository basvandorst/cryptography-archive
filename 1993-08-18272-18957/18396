Of course, given a drug "kingpin," he or she could have quite a selection
of CLipper phones (I mean, how many phones==1 BMW?)

Or he/she could save hard earned money and just use encryption above
the Clipper level.

I wonder whether there are handwidth inhibitiors in Clipper which would
make data transmission difficult?  Oh well, it could always just 
modulate the audio with the audio from a local radio station.

   I am working on a serial.device driver for the Amiga Computer.  What it
   does it take ANY ASCII data passing through the serial device and encrypts
   it.  The reciever would have the same serial.device and would have to have
   the same password file to read the data. I was planning on using either
   IDEA or the DES algorithm, as I can get very decent speed from both
   algorithm's running on an Amiga 3000 (Motorla 68030) or Amiga 4000 (Motorola
   68040).  What I wanted to know is should I encrypt each character as it
   passed through the serial device, or would it be better to buffer the
   output and encrpyt all the buffered data every 5 seconds or so?..

   Can a single character be encrypted successfully?  I tried with the IDEA
   algorithm to encrypt the letter h, and the ciphertext was 12 bytes!

Well, aren't IDEA and DES both block ciphers? DES for example works on
8-byte blocks, so if you encrypt a single character the encryption
routine will add 7 bytes of nulls and generate 8 bytes of ciphertext
(which if converted to a printable-ASCII representational a la Unix
crypt() will occupy 12 bytes). So use the natural block size of your
algorithm as your chunk size.

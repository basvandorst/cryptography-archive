Naw, look at it from this prospective:

	1) Every Clipper chip has serial number and a "master key"
	   associated with it.
	2) There is a huge "secure" (oh yes? :-) database with all
	   the serial numbers of chips made and their keys.
	3) Every chip spits out it's serial number and session key,
	   both encrypted with "global master key" - this is packed
	   into the infamous Law Enforcement Abuse Field - LEAF (tm).
	
Now, prying that Law Enforcement Abuse Field open,  they identify 
not *your* ID, but the chip's ID, presumably to use it to get the
session key to decrypt the conversation... To this point, there's
no information about *who* the chip in question belongs to!

In light of the above - how is it going to help you? (:-)

Hey, I thought you knew the rules! (:-)

Actually, they'd probably present just *one* application for tapping
your line, because of <whatever you've done lately :->,  and having
it granted - anything going over the phone wire between your place
and the local phone company is fair game for them.  I'd assume it
would be normal for them to call those Escrow Agencies several
times a day, saying: "Our suspect just changed the chip, here
is the new serial number, and this is the warrant..."

And why not?

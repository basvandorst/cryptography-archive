No.  From Bihan and Shamir, Differential Cryptanalysis of a DES-like
Cryptosystem, Journal of Cryptology, 4:1 (1991) :


	Note that every key can be viewed as a special type of 
	and independent key.

	Remark.  To simplify probabilistic analysis of our attack,
	we assume that all the subkeys are independent.

They say DES with independent subkeys can be broken in 2^61 steps,
which is longer than it takes to break standard DES (but not much).
Only the analysis of their method is harder with dependent keys,
not the breaking of the cipher.

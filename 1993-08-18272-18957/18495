   Again, this isn't a defense. As you admit, it just makes things a bit
   more expensive for the man in the middle.

Having had this discussion with Dan before, and lost :-), I'll have to
back him up here.  If your opponent is sufficiently omniscient and omnipotent,
you really *can't* be sure.  If God is switching around photons before
they reach your eyes, how would you know?  If my memories of meeting
John Gilmore actually are from "Total Recall takes you to Usenix",
maybe he doesn't exist.  For that matter, am I me, or am I .... Memorex?
Or maybe I really only met his CIA double.  Unlikely - they'd also have to
have put a fake picture in the New York Times, and everyone knows
that's never happened at such a reputable paper :-)

Less unlikely is that they've switched John's computer keyboard and recorded
his PGP passphrase, and some of the keys "he" signed are really for
NSA folks impersonating people he signed keys for, who are sending out
fake messages from the wiretap in John's phone line, which is why the
cypherpunks mailing list connection is sometimes so slow...

The military's rules for handling highly classified information
require that *two* people handle it at all times, so bribing or
planting one person isn't enough, and two is much harder.
But things like this do happen - the Bill Clinton in office is clearly not 
the same guy as that great candidate who was running for election last fall :-)

More seriously, you really *can't* totally prevent man-in-the-middle attacks;
you can often raise the level of difficulty if you have several
communications paths, but you *do* have to check the security of all of them.

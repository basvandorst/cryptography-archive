John Galt is the hero in one of Ayn Rand's books (Atlas shrugged?).
He does a famous speech at the end of the book about how government has
destroyed any ability to do anything.  Kind of like our situation
today, but the book was written in the '50's.  Galt's gulch had a
device to make it invisible so none of the government officials could
find it.  Sort of a Sci-Fi-sociological look at where we were heading
in the '50's and unfortunatly too damn accurate.

got to admit What? is a cryptic message.

Patience, persistence, truth,
Dr. mike

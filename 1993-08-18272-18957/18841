	There is a company called AccessData which sells password cracking
programs for different common programs, such as Lotus123(tm) and WordPerfect(tm)
They have some means of verifying that the person buying the program isn't 
using it on someone else's stuff, some sort of signature and mail-back deal
that I forgot about.  The address is:
	AccessData, 87 East 600 South, Orem, Utah 84058
		(800) 658-5199
		(Utah cities have funny street names.  This is correct.)

Jerry.

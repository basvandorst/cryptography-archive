I am doing a project on PC with borlandc C. It is about D-H keyexchange and 
RSA. However, I found a lot of problems for handling large integer calculation
such as a^b(mod n) where a b and n are large integers which can be more than
20 digits long. Does anyone can send me a package or program which can
handle this problem? Please send email to me. Thank you for your help!

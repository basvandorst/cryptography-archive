Baltimore is sometimes called "Clipper City" in reference to the 
fast sailing vessels called "Clippers" that frequented the port.
Baltimore is also just a stone's throw away from the NSA's headquarters
in Fort Meade and I'm sure that it's drinking and eating establishments
are a favorite for workers at the NSA. So I guess this adds a new
dimension to the term "Clipper City."

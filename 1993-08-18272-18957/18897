Hmm... Party A could use a suitable arrangement of r,s,t,u so, that p0=r*s,
q0=t*u, p1=r*t (or r*u) and q1=s*u (or s*t) so, that she can announce either
p0,q0 or p1,q1 when the time comes to declare the winner.  This relies on
the fact, that B won't (or can't) check the announced p,q for primality.

In fact, only three primes r,s,t will be sufficient, but the difference in
the order of magnitude between p and q could probably make B suspect about
this cheat (larger of them would have to be close to the smaller squared).

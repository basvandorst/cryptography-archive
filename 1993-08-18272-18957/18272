   There are several criteria used to evaluate S-boxes.  The big ones
that I recall from one article I read are the strict avalanche criterion
and nonlinearity.  The strict avalanche criterion is satisfied if, over
the whole range of possible inputs to the S-box, changing any given bit
in the input has a 0.5 probability of changing any given bit of S-box
output.  Nonlinearity means there is no good linear or affine approximation
for the output of the S-box.
 
   I don't recall the details, but I seem to recall that one method for
building strong n-bit --> n-bit S-boxes centered around finding
n n-bit-->1-bit functions, and then finding ways that combined them in
acceptable ways.  Ah, also it's important that all possible n-bit output
values can appear in an n-bit --> n-bit S-box.  Anyone recall what this
trait is called?

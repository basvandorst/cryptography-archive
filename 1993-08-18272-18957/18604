'wphw650es' is most certainly in a good crack dictionary; it is simply
the dictionary word 'albatross' and the systematic keyboard munging
you describe...  why do you suppose that 'qwerty' and 'poiuyt' and
quite a few others are even hard-coded in?

Also, it is hard to remember both a word AND a systematic munging, while
easy for a program to permute.  Overall, the key idea is that you want to play
to the human strengths (association, cultural anti-norms, mnemonic devices)
while playing to the weakness of computer programs (avoid passphrase generation
techniques that can be described in a quantitative way (linear functions,
permutations of denumerable sets, etc.)).

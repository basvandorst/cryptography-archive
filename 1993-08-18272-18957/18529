I don't believe in the use of feedback in stream cipher RNJ algorithms.

To avoid looping through a short series you could use a counter as input
to a block cipher instead of using feedback. Thus you are guaranteed to
loop through all values of the counter. If the block cipher is secure
there should be no correlation between E(i) and E(i+1). I bounced this
"counter method" concept off Dorothy Denning and Martin Hellman a couple
of years ago and they gave it their blessing, for what it's worth.

Combining CBC with a counter method RNJ would give you a cipher with the
strengths of both systems:

C(i) = E(M(i)^C(i-1),K) ^ E(i+IV,K)

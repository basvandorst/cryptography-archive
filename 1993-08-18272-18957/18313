VMS has used both username and password together with some salt to compute
the hashed value in the password file for a long time (for all I know it
always has).  This is because the password file is publicly readable, and if
you don't do it this way somebody could mount a password attack by changing
his/her own password and seeing if the resulting value in the p/w file
matches that of anybody else...

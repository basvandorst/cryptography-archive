Hello,

can you help me with the following problem?

Any efficient algorithm for extracting square roots modulo a (composed)
number n leads to an efficient algorithm for the  factorization of n.
This was proofed by Michael Rabin in 1979.
(Select a random number a (0<a<n), compute the square root of a^2 and
if this root isn't congruent to a or -a  you can factorize n.)

In the same paper Rabin states (without proof) that if
    n=pq (p,q primes of the form 3k+1 with k a natural number)
then any efficient algorithm for extracting cubic roots modulo n
leads to an efficient algorithm for the factorization of n.

This puzzles me very much. Can anybody give me a hint how to prove
this? (Or was Rabin wrong?)

Thank you

  Stefan

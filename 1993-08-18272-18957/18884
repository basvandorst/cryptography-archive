I particularly found amusing/disturbing the story of the criminals who set up an
ATM in a mall, which read card numbers, requested a PIN, and then replied
"Sorry, this transaction is temporarily unavailable."  (Or words to that
effect).  At the end of the day they had several people's card numbers and PINs
and created phony cards with the numbers and used them in bona fide ATMs.  There
are several counter-measures that could be used to prevent this sort of thing,
and it was surprising that they were not in place.

More surprising was the small amount of money that they made off with before
they got caught.

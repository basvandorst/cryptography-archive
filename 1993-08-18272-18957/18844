Hello, cryptographers society!

Good question (I hope not a FAQ):
How to process encrypted data without decryption?

It seems, there are two practically usefull aspects of this problem:

1) "Encrypted" numeric math, ie math operations that will allow to
   process encrypted numbers and to obtain correctly encrypted result.

2) "Encrypted" relational algebra which will allow to process any
   (not a numeric) data in encrypted databases.

Are the some publications in this field?

I'll be glad to read anybody's opinion in sci.crypt newsgroup.

Sincerely,
            R. Dense

Good as any IMO.

Just a side note - where did you hear this?

There are essentially only 3 methods of authenticating a user -

1)  Something you are (ex. - fingerprint, voice scan)

2)  Something you have (ex. - ID card)

3)  Something you know (ex. - password)

You more or less rule out #2 from above.

You more or less rule out #3.

You more or less rule out #1.

This is a subset of #3.  It has the advantage of having a built-in
mnemonic.  But what if I have 3 such accounts?  Do I use the same
incident/detail on all 3?  I can see other problems with this
technique as well.

This is one of those additional problems :)

>Is there any way for me to identify myself without cryptography?

Your phrasing and conditions pretty much rule out every method.  I
suggest you rethink the conditions, and loosen up one or more.

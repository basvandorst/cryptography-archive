I didn't mean to imply that short loops would be of length 3 - I was
just using a-->b-->c-->a as a graphic example. I'm very rusty on
probability theory and I don't have any appropriate textbooks handy so I
can't confirm that the average loop length would be 2**32 for a 64 bit
block cipher.

Yes, but both of these examples are stream ciphers, some security is
lost by not performing block substitution on the plaintext since there
is no interdependency of the bits.

Combining CBC with the counter method gives you the strength of both
block and stream ciphers. To use your nomenclature:

C_i = E_k(P_i XOR C_i-1) XOR E_k(i+IV)

By the way, is there a "standard" for expressing this sort of thing in
ASCII? Some people represent exponentiation as a**b, some as a^b, but
^ is XOR in the C language.

I guess it boils down to the average loop length and the chances of
getting a short loop. Can you support your assertions that the average
loop length would be 2**32 and that using the 2 previous blocks would
indeed square the loop length? I'm not clear how those assertions can be
supported. Note that CBC+CM has a demonstrably long loop length.

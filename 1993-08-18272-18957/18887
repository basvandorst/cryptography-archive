I hope that people on this group can help.

I am aware of several documents which detail `netiquette' as it applies to
Usenet (Ex: `A Primer on How to Work with the Usenet Community'. `Emily
Postnews', etc.).

I`ve always wondered if such a document existed which did the same in
regards to e-mail discussion groups.  (not just regular person-person email)

I know that on some groups I`ve been there have been people who don't follow
excepted behavior (ie, sending a message ment for one person to the whole list
etc.)  I know some lists exist for specific groups, but was wondering if
there existed a more generic version.

Any help here?

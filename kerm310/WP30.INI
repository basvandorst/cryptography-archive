;KEYS WITH SPECIAL MS-KERMIT FUNCTIONS:
;     Here is a list of keys under the WP key mapping which have special
;     functions local to MS-Kermit.  Some are new keys, which had no
;     special meaning in the default MS-Kermit key mapping.  Others had to
;     be remapped from their default location, because of conflict with WP
;     functions.  If you need the functionality of other default MS-Kermit
;     keys that have been overridden by WP keys, but not remapped, see the
;     instructions below for HOW TO CUSTOMIZE THIS INITIALIZATION FILE.

;USING MS-KERMIT WITH UNIX AND VAX/VMS WORDPERFECT PRODUCTS:
;     Read sections I. and II. for UNIX instructions
;     Read sections I. and III. for VAX/VMS instructions
;
;I.   To initialize MS-Kermit for running UNIX or VAX/VMS WordPerfect
;     products:
;     1)   Create a file called "mskermit.ini" in the same directory as your
;          "kermit.exe" and this "wp30.ini" file, if it is not already
;          created.  Make sure the mskermit.ini file sets the communications
;          parameters appropriately for your serial connection.
;          For example:
;               set speed 9600      ;or 2400, or 19200, or whatever
;               set port COM1       ;or COM2 or whatever
;               set display 7-BIT   ;or 8-BIT if you have an 8-bit connection
;               set parity EVEN     ;or ODD, or NONE, or whatever
;               set local-echo OFF  ;or ON (usually OFF)
;               set flow-control XON/XOFF     ;or NONE (usually XON/XOFF)
;               set handshake NONE            ;or XON or XOFF
;     2)   By default, MS-Kermit auto-senses what kind of graphics card you
;          have, but if you have a VGA card, Kermit by default will run it in
;          EGA mode (640x350) so that it has room to save and restore the
;          complete graphics screen when you toggle in and out of graphics
;          mode.  If you would rather have the full VGA resolution (640x480)
;          and you don't care if the last few pixel lines are not saved and
;          restored, you can add the following line to your mskermit.ini file:
;               set terminal graphics VGA     ;AUTO-SENSING is default
;     3)   If you want the WP key mapping to take effect IMMEDIATELY, when
;          you run MS-Kermit, you should add the following lines to the end
;          of your mskermit.ini file:
;               take wp30.ini
;               connect
;          Otherwise, if you want the default vt320 key mapping (which maps
;          F1-F4 to PF1-PF4, etc.) to be in effect until you press
;          ALT-APOSTROPHE('), or the host application sends ESC[?34h, then
;          you should add the following lines to the end of your mskermit.ini
;          file:
;               set terminal vt320
;               define terminalS take wp30.ini, connect
;               set key \2344 \KterminalS  ;assign macro to ALT-APOSTROPHE(')
;               connect
;
;II.  To run UNIX WordPerfect products over the MS-Kermit vt320 emulator:
;     1)   Start kermit.exe on your PC, with the mskermit.ini file described
;          above.
;     2)   Check the physical connection from your PC's serial port to the
;          UNIX host, or to a dial-out modem, to make sure it's ready.
;     3)   Login to the UNIX host (dialing out if necessary).
;     4)   Type "setenv WPTERM kermit" if you're in a csh shell, or
;          "WPTERM=kermit; export WPTERM" if you're in an sh shell.
;     5)   Make sure your PATH variable is set up correctly, and that the
;          WordPerfect application is installed and ready to run according to
;          its documentation.
;     6)   Run the application.  (Type "wp" or "shell" or whatever.)
;     7)   Press F3 for Kermit-specific help.  F1 through F10 (alone or with
;          Shift, Ctrl, or Alt) and Application Keypad keys will work the same
;          as they do running the PC version of the WordPerfect product.  F11
;          and F12 will always perform the same functions as Alt-F3 and Alt-F4
;          respectively (usually "Reveal Codes" and "Block").
;     8)   To select the correct graphics driver in WordPerfect 5.0, press
;          Shift-F1, D, G to get to the "Setup: Display: Graphics Screen Type"
;          menu.  If your PC has a graphics card, you will want to select the
;          "kermit30_sixel" (or equivalent) graphics driver; otherwise select
;          the "text" driver.
;
;III. To run VAX/VMS WordPerfect products over the MS-Kermit vt320 emulator:
;     1)   Start kermit.exe on your PC, using the mskermit.ini file described
;          above.
;     2)   Check the physical connection from your PC's serial port to the
;          VAX/VMS host, or to a dial-out modem, to make sure it's ready.
;     3)   Login to the VAX/VMS host (dialing out if necessary).
;     4)   Type "set terminal/inquire/noeightbit/hostsync/ttsync" to make VMS
;          set the terminal port characteristics according to what MS-Kermit
;          answers back.  (You can type "show terminal" to see what they've
;          been set to.)
;     5)   Make sure the WordPerfect application is installed and ready to run
;          according to its documentation.
;     6)   Run the application.  (Type "wp" or "office" or whatever.)
;     7)   Press F3.  If you get the HELP menu, then your PC-function keys are
;          probably mapped correctly.  F1 through F10 (alone or with Shift,
;          Ctrl, or Alt) and Application Keypad keys will work the same as
;          they do running the PC version of the WordPerfect product.  F11 and
;          F12 will always perform the same functions as Alt-F3 and Alt-F4
;          respectively (usually "Reveal Codes" and "Block").  The keystrokes
;          described under HELP may be for a vt100 keyboard, instead of your
;          PC keyboard, however, you can press F3, F3, 4 and select each of
;          menu items 1 through 3 to see the complete PC keyboard Function key
;          layout.
;     8)   If pressing F3 does NOT display the HELP menu, you are probably
;          running WordPerfect 5.0 and you need to select a different
;          Keyboard Layout.  Type Ctrl-F, S, E, K, to get to the "Setup:
;          Keyboard Layout" menu.  Arrow down to the keyboard layout named
;          "WPCORP_WP42_DEFAULT," and press RETURN to select it, followed by
;          RETURN to exit out of Setup.  Now you should be able to use all
;          of the PC Function keys as described above in the previous step.
;          NOTE:  You can always use Ctrl-Z to exit VAX/VMS WordPerfect
;          products, no matter what Keyboard Layout is in effect.
;     9)   If you see a blinking "N" in the lower right-hand corner of your
;          screen, you can turn it off by pressing Ctrl-K.  On DEC terminals
;          it indicates that the keypad is in Numeric mode, but it will
;          probably not reflect the true state of the kermit keypad.
;          NOTE:  This Keyboard Layout will be saved in your WP settings file,
;          so it will be selected automatically the next time you run
;          WordPerfect 5.0, EVEN if you're running from a real DEC terminal.
;     10)  To select the correct graphics driver in WordPerfect 5.0, press
;          Shift-F1, D, G to get to the "Setup: Display: Graphics Screen Type"
;          menu.  If your PC has a graphics card, you will want to select the
;          "Sixel" graphics driver; otherwise select the "Text" driver.
;          NOTE:  This graphics driver will be saved in your WP settings file,
;          so it will be selected automatically the next time you run
;          WordPerfect 5.0, EVEN if you're running from another terminal
;          that does not have sixel graphics.
;     11)  Early versions of VAX/VMS WordPerfect 5.0 may not ask MS-Kermit for
;          the resolution of your graphics card, but instead may try to write
;          graphics to the resolution of a vt330/vt340 (800x480).  IF YOU SEE
;          GRAPHICS TRYING TO BE WRITTEN OFF THE EDGE OF YOUR SCREEN in
;          Figure-Edit or Print-Preview, you probably need to create a special
;          logical name table with your specific resolution info.  Type the
;          following commands from the DCL command line:
;          $    create/name_table wpcorp_terminal_table
;          $    define/table=wpcorp_terminal_table graphics_size 720,348
;          Replace 720,348 with the x,y resolution of your graphics card.
;               VGA = 640x480 (needs "set term graphics VGA" in mskermit.ini)
;               EGA, or VGA in EGA mode = 640x350 (see step I.3 above)
;               Hercules = 720x348
;          Whenever you want WordPerfect 5.0 to go back to its default
;          graphics resolution, you can type:
;          $    deassign/table=wpcorp_terminal_table graphics_size
;     12)  You may want the WP key mapping of the MS-Kermit keyboard to be
;          automatically invoked whenever you run any VAX/VMS WordPerfect
;          product, and automatically cleared (leaving the default vt320
;          key mapping, which maps F1-F4 to PF1-PF4, etc.) whenever you exit
;          a VAX/VMS WordPerfect product.  To do this, you must create the
;          logical name table called "wpcorp_terminal_table" if you did not
;          already create it in the previous step.  Then you must set two
;          values in that table.  Type the following commands from the DCL
;          command line:
;          $    create/name_table wpcorp_terminal_table !(if not already done)
;          $    esc=""              !(clear symbol named "esc")
;          $    esc[0,8]=27         !(assign ASCII 27 to 1st byte of "esc")
;          $    define/table=wpcorp_terminal_table begin_control "''esc'[?34h"
;          $    define/table=wpcorp_terminal_table end_control "''esc'[?34l"
;                                                              (lowercase L)
;          Whenever you want to cancel this feature, you can type:
;          $    deassign/table=wpcorp_terminal_table begin_control
;          $    deassign/table=wpcorp_terminal_table end_control
;          You can always toggle manually between the WP key mapping and the
;          vt320 default, by pressing ALT-APOSTROPHE(').
;
;----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;TO USE THIS INITIALIZATION FILE WITH A VERSION OF MS-KERMIT EARLIER THAN
;VERSION 3.0:
;     You will not be able to get WordPerfect 5.0 graphics with versions of
;     MS-Kermit earlier than 3.0, however, you can get complete text
;     functionality in the later versions.
;
;     For versions 2.31 and 2.32 you will have to change "set terminal VT320"
;     to "set terminal VT102" and you will have to comment out (insert a
;     semicolon at the beginning of the line) a number of key definitions,
;     because not as much space was available in these versions.  You may just
;     want to comment out all of the WordPerfect Quick Macro key definitions
;     at the end of this file (Alt-A through Alt-Z), since these are also
;     accessible by pressing Alt-1 followed by a through z.
;
;     For versions of MS-Kermit earlier than 2.31, you may have to comment out
;     even more key definitions, and remove certain kermit commands that did
;     not exist in the earlier versions.
;
;----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;HOW TO CUSTOMIZE THIS INITIALIZATION FILE:
;
;     If you understand how this initialization file was designed, cryptic as
;it may seem, you will better be able to customize it.  The general idea is
;to use MS-Kermit's remapable keyboard to make each PC function key (or
;combination of keys) send an escape sequence to the VAX/VMS or UNIX host,
;which will result in invoking the function that the user is used to getting
;when he presses that key (or combination of keys) in the DOS version of the
;WordPerfect product.
;     The set of escape sequences which were chosen were those which are
;normally sent from a DEC vt100 terminal.  When you run a UNIX or VAX/VMS
;WordPerfect product, using this initialization file, the host application
;actually treats incoming escape sequences as if they were coming from a vt100
;keyboard.  (VAX/VMS WordPerfect 5.0 only uses the vt100 Keypad keys as basic
;function keys if the "WPCORP_WP42_DEFAULT" Keyboard Layout is selected.)
;When the vt100 Keypad is in Application mode, each of the basic WordPerfect
;functions can be invoked by either pressing a single Keypad key, or by
;pressing PF1, PF2, or PF3 followed by one of the Keypad keys.  Other
;functions are invoked by pressing PF1, or Home, or Home,Home followed by an
;Arrow Key.  Here is a diagram that shows how each WordPerfect function is
;invoked on the vt100, and what escape sequence each of the keys sends to the
;host:

;To CUSTOMIZE a key definition, you must go through exactly the same process
;as was already done for each key definition in this file:
;
;     1)   From the MS-Kermit prompt, type "show key" <RETURN>.
;     2)   Press the PC key or combination of keys to be remapped.
;     3)   Note the decimal number (\????) which is shown after the words
;          "Scan Code."  This is the number by which kermit knows that key or
;          combination of keys.
;     4)   Locate the WordPerfect function in the diagram above, which you
;          would like the key to perform.  You may have to find the
;          WordPerfect 5.0 equivalent to a key in another WordPerfect product.
;          For instance, "Font" is the WP 5.0 equivalent of "Print Format" in
;          WP 4.2, and "Merge R" is the WP 5.0 equivalent of "Send" in WP
;          Mail, because the equivalent functions are invoked by the same PC
;          Function key in their respective DOS products.
;     5)   Determine the escape sequence(s) that would be sent by a vt100 to
;          invoke that WP function.  If the key is preceded by PF1, PF2, PF3,
;          or Home(PF4), then put the two escape sequences together.
;     6)   From the MS-Kermit prompt, type the command "set key \xxxx yyyy",
;          where xxxx is the decimal number by which kermit knows the PC key,
;          and yyyy is a string of \27(Escape)'s and letters taken from the
;          diagram above.  The second parameter may also be a predefined MS-
;          Kermit verb, such as \Kupscn, which performs a local kermit
;          function, such as scrolling the screen up, or \Kexit, which exits
;          from an MS-Kermit connection.
;     7)   Connect to your host and test the key in your WP application.
;     8)   If it works, then insert the same "set key ... ..." command into
;          your own copy of this initialization file.  You will want to
;          locate comment out (put a semicolon before) any other definitions
;          in the file that attempt to map the same key.
;
;EXAMPLE:  Assume we want to change the PC key F11 to invoke the WP function
;"Center," instead of "Reveal Codes":
;
;     1)   We type "show key" from the MS-Kermit prompt.
;     2)   We press the F11 key on our PC keyboard.
;     3)   We note the Scan Code number by which kermit will know the F11 key,
;          which is \389.
;     4)   We locate the "Center" function on the diagram above.  We see that
;          "Center" is invoked on a vt100 by pressing PF1 followed by 5 on the
;          Application Keypad.
;     5)   We look at the escape sequences in the diagram, that correspond to
;          the PF1 key (\27OP) and the KP5 (\27Ou).  We combine the two escape
;          sequences to get \27OP\27Ou.
;     6)   We type "set key \389 \27OP\27Ou" from the MS-Kermit prompt to
;          remap the key.
;     7)   We connect to our host and start WordPerfect.  We press the F11 key
;          and see if it performs the "Center" function instead of the "Reveal
;          Codes" function.
;     8)   If it worked, then we insert the "set key \389 \27OP\27Ou" command
;          into our copy of the initialization file, beneath the line which
;          already read "set key \389 \27OR\27Oy".  Then we insert a ";" at
;          the first of the old line, to comment it out.

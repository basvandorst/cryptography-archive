PGP 2.6.3i - Readme for DLL-Version
- - -----------------------------------
notes by Jens von Pilgrim, June 1997

This distribution of PGP contains two parts:

1) The original version of pgp 2.6.3i - sources compiled by
   Stale Schumacher for Windows 95/NT
   This part contains following files:
   - pgp263ii.zip
   - pgp263ii.asc (Stale Schumacher's signature of pgp263ii.zip) 
   - Setup.doc   
   - Readme.usa
   - Readme.1st

2) The additional dll-version of pgp 2.6.3i -sources modified by
   Jens von Pilgrim for Windows 95/NT
   This part vontains following files:
   - pgp263idll.zip
   - pgp263idll.asc (Jens von Pilgrim's signature of pgp263idll.zip)
   - XString.zip
   - jpgp.zip	
   - ReadmeDll.1st (this file)


Important:
Please read the files "Readme.usa" and "Readme.1st".

The dll-version of pgp 2.6.3i is only an addon-product.
All restrictions, copyright notes, hints, advices and so on of
the original version of pgp 2.6.3i are also valid for the pgp-dll-version!

The dll-zip-file contains all files you need to build a pgp-dll.
If you want to build the dll, you have to define the preprocessor-statement
#define JvP_DLL
somewhere, the best place to define it is in the compile-settings.
You can also build the original pgp by not defining JvP_DLL.

For the dll you need the string-class XString. This class is also published with
the open object library of Stefan von Brauk, available for OS/2 (Windows 95 version
is in work). XString is freeware and copyright by Jens von Pilgrim.

The dll is the orgiginal pgp-version, modified to fit as a dll.

jpgp is a simple "graphical" interface for pgp. You can use it instead of pgp.exe.
You need Visual C++ 4.0 to build it. Just generate a new workspace called pgptest.
Then you copy the zipped files in the created directory, add all cpp-files, 
set the path to "pgp263i.lib" and that's it.

A more comfortable tool is also available from http://www.gwdg.de/~jpilgri/jvppgp.
It's called jvppgp frontend. This frontend is also useable as an extension for the freeware
mail-programm PEGASUS Mail 32. Just look on this pages.

I hope all things work fine. As usual, no programm is 100% error-free.
The author isn't responsible for any losses which occurs because 
you're using this software!

This file contains modifications which implement a feature
that can restrict users from posting or sending mail.
In the WIN.INI [WinVN] section,
If AuthReqPost=1 or AuthReqMail=1, the corresponding
function will be disabled unless the user has successfully
authenticated himself/herself with the news server.
This feature is implemented in the reader itself--the user
might very well have permission to post or send mail as far
as the NNTP or SMTP servers are concerned.

This feature was implemented for public microcomputer labs
at Michigan State University.

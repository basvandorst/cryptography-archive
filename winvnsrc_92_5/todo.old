* Implement 'Find' and 'Find Next' with new header structure.

* 921102 Now compiled with C7, SDK3.1 in large model.

* 921116 Add a prompt for the Subject: line.

* 921122 Put up an hourglass cursor when grabbing a group.  Had to grab
  the mouse, though.  I don't like it.

           in certain instances.  Not fixed.  UpdateSeenArts causes it.

* 921118
  Check into horizontal scroll bar in article window.
    Just adding a horiz bar doesn't seem to work.  It is *always*
    there, regardless of article line length, and the lines get clipped
    anyways.  Will need to fix the DRAW method to correctly handle long
    lines.

* 921118
  Added "Search..." option to the article window, allowing search of 
    article text.  Not very cleanly implemented.

! possible problems reported:  unsubscribe crashes (sometimes!), some 
! groups have screwed up article information.  Why?  May be because of
! old version.

* 921119
  Changed article number to unsigned int from int.  Some newsgroups have
  article numbers over 32767!

* 921120
  With the /Os optimization (small code size), we get problems with the
  huge header array.  Looks like it's not aligning.  Would that
  option change the size of the 'header' data structure?

* 921123
  I tracked down the obnoxious header array problem.  Apparently the
  'slow' compiler doesn't have the same problem packing structs into
  a huge array.  And somehow my TypHeader struct shrunk from 256 bytes
  to 252 bytes.  Oops.  Now it's realigned.

* 921124
  Rearranged the window positions to better match the new wvgroup window.

FIX NEXT SAME SUBJECT BUG.  WHY ME??!

* 930119 (duh!) check for NULL pointer returned by gethostbyname.

Need to incorporate winsock code for wvsock from wu@twg.com (patching
  the non-winsock stuff, too)

Need to check for lost connection in recv();

* 930203 fixed wvsock's PutCommLine somewhat, had send() check for number
  of chars sent, and loop.  This was necessary for our copy of LanMan2.1a

To rebuild, type
'winsock' or
'pathwork'
depending on your desired configuration.

Read further for more details.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rather than deal with copying the pathworks and winsock
files into wvsock.c, and trying to keep track of which
config we were in etc... I have made two makefiles.  I
would have liked to make *one* makefile, with seperate
targets for the two executables, but felt that the effort
needed to understand microsoft's cryptic response-file
garbage was not worth it.  (the difficulty for me is that
I have no clue how to specify a different .def file in
that linker response file mess.  If someone knows how
to rewrite it in a 'normal' way, please do and let me
know how)

'makefile.std' is the winsock makefile, and 'makefile.pwk'
is the pathworks/lanman makefile.

i.e., to compile for winsock, you should type:

nmake -f makefile.std

---
For your convenience, I've created two .bat files,
winsock.bat and pathwork.bat, which simply invoke the
appropriate makefile.

---
I do not use the PWB, so I don't know if these makefiles
will still work in that environment.  (Once out of curi-
osity I tried it.  It mangled my makefile and then crashed).

---
There are rules in these makefiles to create source files
from the RCS database.  On my machine, this database is
stored in the subdir './RCS'.  If you are making changes
to this program that you would eventually like to see
folded into the release, you can:

1) Ask me for the RCS files.
2) Recreate your own using the 'rcs -k' option (this does
   not work with my copy of DOS rcs)
3) Ignore RCS, and let me merge the source trees back in.

If you are using RCS, make sure that RCS and GNU diff are
in the path.

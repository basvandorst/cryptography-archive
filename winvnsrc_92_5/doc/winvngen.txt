Note: gensock.dll does not currently work with FTP Inc.'s WINSOCK.
If anyone can figure out why, I'd like to know!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
WinVNgen is a 'generic' version of winvn, that uses a DLL to hold
the 4 functions normally kept in wvsckxxx.c.  This allows there to
be only _one_ version of winvn, and several versions of the 'GENSOCK'
("generic socket") DLL for each of the multitude of windows sockets
implemenations (of which WINSOCK is one).

Build GENSOCK.DLL (gensock.mak is a visual c++ makefile), and copy it
to 'gwinsock.dll'.

Build WINVNGEN.EXE, and copy it to 'winvn.exe'.

Use as directed.

You can change the desired DLL by adding a GenSockDLL parameter in
the '[Communications]' section of winvn.ini.

GENSOCK.H contains the interface file.
GENSOCK.CPP contains the C++ source for a WINSOCK interface.

Other socket libraries should be easier to write, since GENSOCK.CPP
tries to use WINSOCK's asynchronous message-passing stuff to get a
blocking, yet not-blocking socket (via a PeekMessage Loop).

It would also be nice if there were two versions of each GENSOCK DLL,
one for 'release', and one for 'debugging', that might show the
actual text of the NNTP traffic in the little window.

WinVN version 0.90.5 is now available.

WinVN is an NNTP Newsreader for Windows 3.1 and Windows NT,
originally by Mark Riordan.

There are a few changes and bugfixes from 0.90.4 which we hope you will
enjoy.

o multiple recipients in SMTP mail supported, a .mailrc-like feature
o problems with some SMTP servers should go away.
o more robust handling of XOVER failure (will punt to XHDR)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This should really work with any WINSOCK version 1.1 compliant stack.
If you find one that it doesn't work with, let us know.

Mark Riordan released it in October 1989:

[adapted from "Getting a Copy of WinVN, from the help file]

WinVN is distributed via anonymous FTP from the hosts ftp.ksc.nasa.gov
and ripem.msu.edu.  The definitive version is always on
ftp.ksc.nasa.gov.  Copies of WinVN can often be found at other sites,
but they are sometimes badly out of date.  (The ripem site tends to
lag behind ftp.ksc.nasa.gov by several days).

Both source code and binaries for various platforms are distributed.
The WinVN source code can be compiled for a number of platforms,
including several different Windows versions (for different vendors'
networking suites), and Windows NT on Intel and Alpha AXP machines.
Distributions are in the form of .ZIP files, be sure to user binary
mode FTP to do the transfer.

As of this writing, WinVN source code distributions have file names
starting with WINVNSRC, binary distributions for WINSOCK (a Windows
networking API supported by a number of TCP/IP vendors) have names
starting with WINVNSTD, and binary distributions for DEC Pathworks
have names starting with WINVNPWK.  See the FTP sites for other files.

Here is a sample FTP session.

See the front page of today's (Saturday's) business section for an article
on RC4.  No, they didn't print the code, but they talked about the 
release of the code.

The main question seems to be whether or not the State Department would
pull fast export approval for RC4 with key lengths of 40 bits or yes.  In
the article Bidzos said that it was a possibility, but I think he is
trying to scare people into believing that public dissemination of the
code is a horrible thing.  I can't believe that the State Department is
going to do that.

It's time we all heard the real reasons why RC4 has never been released
publicly.  I have heard enough different reasons from RSA Data Security,
Inc. at enough different times and I don't trust any of them.  If RSA
is simply trying to protect their financial intrests, then patenting the
algorithm will serve them just fine.  If NSA wants secrecy, they lost it
last week when the code was posted.

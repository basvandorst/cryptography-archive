Though this is not legal advice, since I'm not an attorney, I would think
that as long as you didn't discuss elements that RSADSI considers a trade
secret, or quote from the code, you'd be o.k. But you should really ask Jim
Bidzos this question. His address is bidzos@rsa.com. Let us know what he
says.

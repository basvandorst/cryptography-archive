It is computationally feasable to generate all n**n possible random
number sequences for small n, and count the frequency of occurrence of
the n! possible permutations that come out.  I have done this for n up
to 8.  For all values up to 8, and I suspect for all values, the least
likely permutation (which is (n-1)012....(n-2)) occurs 2**(n-1) times.
The "average" permutation should occur n^n/n! times, which according
to Stirling's approx is e**n/sqrt(2*pi*n).  We are getting (2**n)/2
occurences of this permutation, so this permutation is roughly
(pi*n*(2/e)**n) as likely as the average one.

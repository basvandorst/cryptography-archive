This is what I mean. The amount of interprocess communication is so small
as to be meaningless; even for large problems. ALL machines can operate
independently until the data is brought together at the end.

If you would have bothered to study factoring algorithms (you obviously

If you are going to flame, at least try not to be totally ignorant.

I received a transcript and audio tape of a July interview on Swiss Radio 
International, of Hans Buehler, the author of Ver Schlusselt.  Hans was imprisioned in Iran for espionage related to 
suspected "manipulated ciphering equipment", allegations charge.

One of the more interesting statements made is "We have new information 
that 
my former employer for years carried out intelligence activities", (which 
allegedly Hans in now prohibited from making until the results of the 
next 
trial.)
The transcript is quite interesting, but a  rather long file (10K), so 
drop me 
a line if you want an e-mail of the transcript.  If enough want it, I'll 
post 
it.
If you want a copy of the tape, we may be able to work something out...

Best Regards <and all disclaimers>,
Mike

Just me speaking,  you have to be your own judge.

And if David thinks that all amateur security/crypto research has as a single
goal to defraud others, *he* is sadly mistaken.  There are much easier ways
to "crack" these cardphones than to break the "codes".  I suppose the original
writer just wanted the information out of curiosity.  I too am interested in
knowing just *how* secure the so called "secure systems" that surround us are 
-- but I do *not* like someone to then imply that I'm a notorious criminal.

If people weren't curious -- how could the word "research" exist in our vocabulary??

Now, come on and flame me...

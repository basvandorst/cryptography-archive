A single RSA modulus (RSA-129) was factored.  This does not mean that
RSA was broken.

The team that did it logged something like 5,000 MIPS-years of widely
distributed processing time, though having a bunch of Crays would not
have shortened the process in real time because the algorithm used was
cache- and memory-bound, not compute-bound.  So the "FBI or CIA" are
in no better position to do the job than anyone else.

The security of RSA is scalable according to the size of your modulus.
A 1024-bit modulus is not known to be vulnerable to any existing
technology.

US Copyright law has specific provisions for allowing one to modify code 
to make it compatible with one's system.

As far as I can see, the complaint is NOT about violation of copyright 
laws, but the assumption that someone is bound by a contract forbidding 
the disclosure of the agreement (contract law... the position that all 
persons who have a legal copy of the programme have committed themselves 
to such a contract) and one of them violated it (or someone stole a copy 
of the material).

If someone in the UK signed a contract to use the programme, not 
decompile it and only have the authors fix it for them... the violation 
would be a contractual one... not copyright law.

There is no violation in copyright law or patent law (it is not
patented)... it is a question as to whether or not trades-secret law was
violated (and when unencrypted software is put out, how much care were the
originators taking to ensure that the secret could not be leaked?...  that
is important in considering the possible violation... just yelling at
people about the "secret being out" is not reasonable care to see that it
does not leak out) (IANAL) One cannot have a tradesecret drink mix and
publish it in a bartenders' guide for sale and claim trade secrets... if
the code was in products for sale, readable (even if only by computers...
it can be disassembled) it is no secret... their position is that they
were reasonably careful that no one got a copy who did not sign (or at
least was bound, legally, and would know it) a non disclosure agreement.
That is probably false... if you want to protect a trade secret and
publish it (even if only in a format that a computer can understand) you
probably would have to take great care as to who got a copy.

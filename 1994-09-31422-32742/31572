There is a difference... the RSA part of PGP (to encode the IDEA key) is 
a public key system (which is breakable... no problem... WITH A 
SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF WORK)... public key systems are different from 
symmetric systems... RSA is known to be breakable (with no cypher text... 
just factor the "n" part of the public key) (how much work does it take? 
If you use a exponentiation decryption, it is equivalent to factoring... 
are there other ways? How hard is factoring?).

The stuff going into the IDEA part has low redundancy (is compressed)... 
though for non-compressed text, you are right... one has to worry about 
IDEA as well.

The RSA part and the IDEA part are just different animals... and while 
there is now obvious way to make IDEA better (well, OK... Triple RSA or 
something), RSA has the obvious questions (being public key) and ways to 
strengthen (lengthen the key)).

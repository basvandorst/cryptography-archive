Usually, the length of the messages one would need to be able to be sure 
one has the correct decoding, is taken on the order of 
entropy_of_key/redundancey_of_clear_text and while (if the key is made of 
k TRULY random (say, use a quantum system) subkeys of lengths 
n1,n2,...,nk (asuuming k, nj's are known) the length of the key is 
n1*n2*...*nk (assuming them relatively prime in pairs) while the entropy 
is only n1+n2+...+nk

(how many? depends on the redundancy of the original message stream... is 
it plain English, all in CAPS? or what?)

(note: this is how long a message should be to be able to decrypt SOMEHOW 
and does not give any info on how much work would be needed... but if you 
are talking brute force attacks only, that is not important).

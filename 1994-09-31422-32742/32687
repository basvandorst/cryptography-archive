Trouble reading? It say OR with an intent to appropriate a trade secret to
his or her own use or to the use of another.

OR makes the pieces independent. The pieces I refer to are:

Every person is guilty of theft who ... with an intent to appropriate a trade
secret to his or her own use or to the use of another ... uses without
authorization a trade secret.

Note that the only material omitted by the ellipses are independent "or"
clauses.

Clear now?

Note that the above says nothing about how you got the trade secret--by
theft of another, by violation of a duty to secrecy by another, by reading
it somewhere that it appeared, said appearance being without authorization.
Note also that it is RSADSI, the owner of the trade secret, who must give
the authorization, and they have stated explicitly that the Cypherpunks
mailing and the public posts were unauthorized.

It's a pretty strong law, and I suspect it is so because of the endemic
industrial espionage and attempts by the thieves to immunize such espionage
via intermediate "fire breaks" in California high-tech industries. Some may
argue it is over-broad, but until it is overturned by a court of competent
jurisdiction, it's the law.

Note also that since it makes the acts criminal offenses, not civil,
extradition would be available for someone who, for example, violated the
law by posting to California from another state, for example in a newsgroup
known to go to California.

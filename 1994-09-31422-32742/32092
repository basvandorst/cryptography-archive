Browsing thru the options in my WinFax Pro 4.0 I discovered a feature
that seems to allow sending encrypted faxes to others with the same
software installed.  It handles generating public keypairs, providing 
digital signatures, etc.  The package that is beind these features in
WinFax Pro is Microsoft At Work.

Anybody know what algorithms they use for the public key and signature
operations?

Does At Work function in a similaray for e-mail or file transfer?

See my reply to Christian Murphy.
 
1 Plain Text character code     = p
2 Sub-key character code 1 XOR p = p1
3 Sub-key character code 2 XOR p1 = p12
4 Sub-key character code 3 XOR p12  = p123 = Encrypt character code
 
All you know is the character code for an encrypt character.
 
How many guesses will it take for someone to be certain that his guesses
really are the four character codes that were used to create a cipher
character code?   And that is just for on cipher text character.

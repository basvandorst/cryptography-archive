Well, I'm not sure if RC4 algorithm isn't something well known and
published for many years.

Second, it's common thought, that hiding algorithm isn't the best way
to security. Much better way is release algorithm and let people on all
world work on breaking it. If it become broken, you know it was bad.
and because many public people work on it, you hope to know that code is
broken not much later than your enemy.

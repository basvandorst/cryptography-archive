I believe it established that the law authorizing ITAR specified the
definition of "public domain", and that such things were excluded from
export regulations.  (DES implementations appear not to qualify. PGP does.)
That ITAR, in this instance clearly doesn't comply with the law, makes it
voidable (if you have sufficient lawyers).  However, if the government
agencies can agree among themselves that the invalid provisions apply,
they'll still attempt to enforce it.

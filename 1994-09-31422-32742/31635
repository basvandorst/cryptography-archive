(Sorry my original follow up got corrupted, here is a corrected version)
As far as I can remember from my copy of "A dictionary of curious and
interesting numbers" x/ln(x) - pi(x) changes sign an _infinite_ number
of times the first being at (or before) Skewes number whose value
was given as 10^(10^134)

Howdy...  I have been fairly concious of what passwords I choose for an 
Online-Service that I am creating, and passwords for my own security...  
To the point, I have assigned a series of Semi-Random numbers to the 26 
letters of the alphabet.  Is there a way that I can use those numbers 
(1-26) in a simple encryption scheme? For Example, if I want my 
unencrypted password to be AOHELLSUCKS and A = 1 O = 15 etc...  Is there 
an encryption scheme that would let me take those and put them into a 
sum?  I should proboly just think of it myself but I was hopping that 
someone has a fairly complex one that I could use...  Thanks...

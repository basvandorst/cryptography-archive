Like most attempts to construct a straw man refutation, the argument is
silly on its face. It requires "reasonable" terms, and a "reasonable"
remedy. It requires that a consideration changes hands.

You have no property right in a message once posted publicly. The conditions
you propose are not reasonably related to that property right, even if one
existed. The remedy if the other party fails to agree is unreasonable.

Contrast this with RC4. It is not posted publicly  by the property owner. It
is licensed under conditions that are directly and reasonably relevant to
protecting the owner's trade secrets. The remedy (in the case of third party
inclusions containing a disk envelope license, as in Lotus Notes) is to
return the product for a refund, unopened, a simple and reasonable
procedure.

Can we try to keep the silliness down in this discussion. There are plenty
of legitimate serious issues worth discussing (as we have been doing).

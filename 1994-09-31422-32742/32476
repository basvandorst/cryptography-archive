I have written a program which recovers passwords for Word 6.0 files.
The program does more than just decode text as some crackers do.  This
program actually recovers the password used to encrypt the file so all
formatting, and full use of the file is recovered.
 
Anyone interested in receiving a free copy of the program should e-mail a
request to:    Johnk@indirect.com.
 
Anyone finding bugs please contact the author at the same address.

Many encryptions use (M=message, C=encrypted message):

   C=M^e mod n

The trick is... does there exist a single solution? Finitely many? How 
hard are they to find? Most methods of finding them involve:

  M=C^(1/e) mod n where 1/e is the multiplicative inverse modulo 
lambda(n) (Carmichaels function... though one can use Euler's Phi(n)) 
which is (probabalistically) the same as factoring n (to find lambda(n)).

(square roots, if n=pq, p,q primes, each congruent to 3 mod 4, have four 
solutions... but one can give a two bit hash with indicates wich is the 
correct roots... as per, hmmm... Williams in Schneier's book?... the nice 
thing about thist is that being able to solvein general is provably the 
same as factoring n... not usually true of cube roots).

So... is there a more efficient way of finding cube roots (none known in 
general) and how hard is it to factor n (thought to be hard).

(if you know the factors of n, you can solve for the original message)

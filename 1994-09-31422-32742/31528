I have not been asking people to prove a negative. My question is, I believe,
quite valid. You do not answer the question "how safe is PGP/RSA by
merely stating how difficult it is to factor a 1024 bit number unless
you very certain that factoring alone is the only conceivable method which
will provide a solution.

Newsweek might also read what you have had to say and speculate that
some members of the scientific community are becoming over touchy and
defensive about the security of PGP. What, they will ask, is going
on?

Let people speculate.

Here's what the California Code says:

   (b) Every person is guilty of theft who, with intent to
deprive or withhold from the owner thereof the control of a
trade secret, or with an intent to appropriate a trade secret to
his or her own use or to the use of another, does any of the
following:
   (1) Steals, takes, carries away, or uses without
authorization a trade secret.

Well, if I show you the cleartext of your encrypted whatever,
and that is all, then you and everyone else will assume "gee,
they broke my code.  Maybe I ought to change it.

If I show you the cleartext of your encrypted whatever AND the
password, then you will think "Gee, I better fire somebody 
because there is a leak somewhere.

Certainly, if the NSA started taking "DrugLords" and "Terrorists"
to court and bringing evidence to court that was encrypted with
DES but they provided no password, nobody would look at DES with
the same confidence again.  If they did have the password, though,
people would just assume that somebody talked.

A goodly part of encryption is that people think that it works
even if it doesnt.

No we don't know!. Reverse engineering is expresely excluded from
"improper means". Nor is there any reason for us to believe that all
copies of all programs containing it were obtained with a "no reverse
engineering " license, nor that the "no reverese engineering" clause was
part of any license signed by all individuals nor that any such license
was a valid license, etc. We do not know how the source was obtained,
nor has any statement by you or RSA told us how the source was obtained,
Bidzos has said that it was a trade secret. That is not enough to tell
us that it was obtained by improper means, nor have we any way of
knowing whether or not it was.

Not only that, but no one has yet proven that the NSA don't have 
so called "magic spectacles".  You don't need a computer to crack 
a cipher with magic spectacles, you just look through them at the 
cyphertext and it appears in clear.  

Of course, there has been no acknowledgment that the NSA has this 
technology, but you wouldn't expect them to come right out and 
say so.  You hear a lot of hints about them if you keep your 
ears open, and there is no smoke without fire, right?  So unless 
someone can mathematically prove that magic spectacles do not 
exist, then there is no point encrypting anything.

So, Peter, as a knowledgeable legal academic, I invite you (if you'd be kind
enough to teach interested lay people) to post an analysis of the overall
situation. Some of the variables include:

1. Did the original poster reverse engineer in violation of his license?
2. Did the original poster instead have a stolen (unlicensed) copy?
3. What are the duties and the legal exposures of those who see and
   republish the code?
4. Are there any potential criminal charges on the trade secret side of
   this matter, or is it exclusively civil?

and

Since the code is covered by ITAR and requires an export license for EACH
export:

A. Is posting to a newsgroup or mailing list known to go overseas a felony
violation of the ITAR?

B. Is importing the code into the U.S. a violation of ITAR or any other U.S.
law?

Perhaps there are other issues that will also come to mind.

I understand both the FBI and the U.S. Customs Service may be very
interested in this set of incidents, so it would be useful for us to have
the best advice we can in understanding the various ramifications. Such
advice from a law professor would be especially welcome, since one thinks of
such law professors, if not retained by a particular client, to be able to
provide dispassionate, non-partisan analysis.

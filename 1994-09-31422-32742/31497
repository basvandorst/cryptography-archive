I have no problem with the first statement, but the second doesn't make
sense without specifying the key size.  If your modulus is n, which is 
constructed as the product of two approximately equal prime numbers, then 
there are around 2*sqrt(n) numbers that share a factor with n.
Assuming that the x's are randomly chosen, then the probability
of picking a "bad x" is 2*sqrt(N)/N.

Putting in some real numbers, for a key size of 512 bits, this probability
is about 2^{-255}.  For 1024 bit keys, the probability is 2^{-511}, which
is pretty close to what you said (was there an assumption of 1024 bit
keys?  If so, I missed it.)

Anyway, as another poster pointed out, the encryption/decryption still
works even if gcd(x,n)!=1.  It's just that you run the danger of
"accidentally breaking" the key --- however, as described above, the 
probability of this is miniscule.

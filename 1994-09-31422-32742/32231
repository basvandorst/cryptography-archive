: the NSA allows only RC4 to be exported in software titles. My question is, if the
: NSA, who is pushing Clipper, allows RC4 to be shipped, do they have a key?. Or 

With fucks like NSA/NRO, you have to look beyond the obvious to many 
layers.  They deliberately made Skipjack/Clipper weak.  They wanted it to 
be difficult to break, certainly, difficult to have sufficient 
credibility.  They, in the public eye, pushed it hard....  In the back of 
their dark warped heads, they're putting their MasterPlan of getting the 
backlash of hate for Clipper to reflect into wash of unquestioning 
support for the commercial NSA (RSA) algorithms.  They win only if you 
play their game.

If every engineer put RC4 (4096 bit key minimums) into their software and 
sold the millions of copies worldwide, they'd be no way this would be a 
legal issue.  Putting nearly millions of developers and publishers into 
jail would be a physical impossiblity.  And I for one would happy to see 
the greedy puppets in Redwood City in homeless shelters.

Nope.  Hang on and I'll explain why...

What is copyrighted about, say, a videotape of a motion picture is 'the
work'.  This is not the instantiation of a sequence of frames of image and
associated sound onto a specific media, but those frames and sounds
themselves.  If I copyright a motion picture, it doesn't matter what
medium it's placed on, or where.

What matters is where I _sell_ it.  If I sell it only in countries party
to the Berne convention, I'm taking due steps to prevent dedicating it to
the public domain, and I can act against infringers in any competent
court.

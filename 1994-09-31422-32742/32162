Why not? How is this in any way different from the fee that your bank
charges you to write checks or use ATMs? If the return on that fee was
the ability to hide money from the taxman, I should think it would
indeed be worthwhile to many people.

Besides, the question ought not to be what they charge or how they
collect it, but whether the manner in which they collect it maintains
the privacy of their customers.

I have just recovered the original password to the PKZIP 
encryption contest file using the cryptanalysis of the PKZIP 
encryption algorithm that I announced several days ago.  For 
the attack I used the known plaintext of the contest file, which 
was made available by PKWARE (thanks to Jean-loup Gailly and
Douglas Quagliana for passing this along!)  Actual running 
time for the attack was approximately 15 hours on a 
50-mhz '486-50SLC computer.

The hexidecimal representation of the password is
"f7 30 69 89 77 b1 20".  To decrypt the PKCONTST.ZIP file 
on a PC compatible, type:

PKUNZIP -s"{alt-247}0i{alt-137}w{alt-177} " PKCONTST.ZIP

Note: To enter {alt-247} you would depress ALT, type 247
on the numeric keypad, then release ALT.  The last character 
before the final quote is a space (ascii 32).

The plaintext is a sequence of random bytes with the message 
"By George you've done it.  Congratulations!!" at the end.

Cheers,
Paul Kocher

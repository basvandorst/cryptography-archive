Ok, I'm thinking... .think.... think... I give up.
Care to give a hint?  Ok, I will give a hint.  
The info is useful for phone fraud in your fantasies, no where else.

What kind of information?

The idiocy is in your apparent knee-jerk assumption that the
information asked for is useful in breaking the law.  You have not
posted a shred of evidence to support this assumption.  All the
available published facts about how phone cards work (e.g. the ISO
standards) indicate that the information is useless for this purpose,
because of how the cards work.  Unless you are privy to some pretty
amazing technical info about phone cards that none of the rest of us
are, you have jumped to a conclusion without bothering to check the
published technical facts about the subject, which is what an idiot
does.  The authoritarian part is that the conclusion you jump to is to
try to interfere with the free flow of information without a showing a
scintilla of evidence that publishing the information could harm
anyone.

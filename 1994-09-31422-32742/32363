"Bull" doesn not suggest you are trying to conduct an adult discussion.
Nevertheless, if the program has a launching banner which states that it
contains trade secrets, under at least the California law you are then
presumed to know it does, and if you violate them without checking the
agreement you, as an agent of your employer are bound by, you are, as I
read that law, culpable. Dunno about other jurisdictions.

Usual disclaimer--I'm not an attorney and, as I understand it, neither are
you.

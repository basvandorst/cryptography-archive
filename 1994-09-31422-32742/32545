EXCUSE ME?   You are talking through your hat here.  This message, whether
you wish to admit it or not, is copyrighted by me (in the very moment of
its creation!)   This attaches certain restrictions to who can do what with
this message.

The mere fact that I have "posted" it to a Usenet newsgroup merely means that
I have self-published this item, and have caused certain actions to occur that,
in effect, cause me to give each netnews reader a copy of this article.  I, as
the author, have a perfect right to do that, I cannot violate my own copyright,
just as a homeowner cannot sue themself for liability.

Were I to place distribution restrictions in this message (e.g. by forbidding
certain net service providers from distributing it on their machines, or to
forbid certain (or all) CD-ROM producers to not include the message on their
CD-ROMs)  I could certainly have grounds to take legal action against those
who ignore or violate those restrictions.  (Not that I am likely or unlikely
to win.)

Copyright *is* a property right.  And your simply asserting that I have
no copyright is not effective to abrograte this right.

Note carefully, also, that copyright is a very different thing from some
sort of contractual agreement that is attempted to be made via the "shrink-
wrap license" or other contracts of adhesion.

If you are going to make broad statements, get them right.

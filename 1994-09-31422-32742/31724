Of course, if you have a cylic group, logs make sense (like the
multiplicative group in a finite field)... of course, the multiplicative
group mod n (if n is not prime... or a power of a prime) is generally not
cyclic (multiplicative group... the elements relatively prime to n under
multiplications). 

I was wondering... if n=pq (p,q primes) there are two generators, say, 
g,h (g of order p-1, h of order q-1)... with respect to the pair g,h 
every element can be written uniquely as g^a*h^b (a only defined mod p-1, 
b mod q-1)... should we define the "log" modulo the pair (g,h) of x where 
g^a*h^b=x as the pair (a mod (p-1), b mod (q-1)) or have to keep saying 
"the coeficients in the cyclic decomposition of the multiplicative group 
modulo n"... I think extending the term "log" to ordered pairs (for 
n=pq... ordered n-tuples in other cases... but do you expand in invariant 
factors or elementary divisors?... I suggest invariant factors to limit the 
number of generators)

(ouch... I just realized... some people may understand the above, but the 
majority of readers will not... so what?... it is a note on the difficulty 
of defining logs for composite n, where the multiplicative group, 
generally, does not have just one generator...[it does if n=p^j where p 
is prime, though])

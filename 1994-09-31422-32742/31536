Minor elaboration of the protocol I presented for ZK-G3C. Apologies
for the sloppiness.

 DG> 1. Prover generates a random mapping of the colours {1, 2, 3} into a
 DG>    set {R, G, B}. It then locks the {R, G, B} labels for all m
 DG>    vertices in m boxes using the one-way function.

I meant to imply that it then sends the locked versions of m boxes to
the verifier as well. I don't think this was clear from the quoted
lines.

 DG> 2. Verifier chooses a random edge e, and asks for the colour of
 DG>    vertices u and v, where e = <u, v>.

 DG> 3. Prover sends the keys to boxes corresponding to u and v.

This is only if the verifier has sent a valid edge (ie physically in
the graph). Else, the prover doesn't do anything.

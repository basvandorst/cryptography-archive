It's still open, as far as I know, but,  the sole direct precedent on
"shrink wrap" (or envelope) licenses is that they are NOT enforceable, and
that there can be an actual SALE of a software disk even if a license is
claimed.  However, a license CAN restrict reverse engineering.  BTW, Lotus
Notes is off-the-shelf, so the precedent is relevant.

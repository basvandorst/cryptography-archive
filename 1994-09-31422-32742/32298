It's not just "the" perpetrator, who apparently posted the code to the
Cypherpunks mailing list.

It's anyone else who posts the code to a newsgroup that goes overseas
automatically, posting from the U.S. This would probably include posting
enough of the code to be cryptographically useful, as in a discussion of it
on sci.crypt, etc., without an export license.

The law requires an export license for EACH instance of export.

Some here may like brave words, but being at the receiving end of an FBI or
Customs Service investigation is neither pleasant, free, nor low in its
demands on one's time. At some point one may face the cold shock of the
difference between juvenile verbal bravado and real life. Some already have.

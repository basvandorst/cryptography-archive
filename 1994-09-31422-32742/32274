So?  I am afraid that you haven't been following all of the discussion
either.  Many states (and I don't just mean states of the U.S.A.) have
the concept of void conditions in contracts - i.e. you can put the
condition in a contract, but it carries no legal weight.  If a copy
were legally passed onto an organisation in a state where the license
contained void conditions (or were void in its entirety), no law need
necessarily have been broken.

Your remark about unsupported allegations is quite true, but it applies
to both sides.  Perhaps the evidence will be produced in court, though
I am rather doubtful.  Until it has been produced, the best that we
outsiders can say is that there has been an unsupported allegation of
wrong-doing.

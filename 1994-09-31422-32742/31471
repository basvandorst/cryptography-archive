   The transformations I used have not been shown to be in P-time, so
this is not a proof that NP=coNP, just that a dual exists which is in
NP for some other size bound.  However, it might be worth trying to
make it into a proof. ;-)

   Why mention it at all?  In this discussion I get to assume P=NP
(but not provable), and therefore I can assume that finding a
(polynomially bounded) dual is in P if it is in NP (even if I don't
know how, there must exist an algorithm), so that this is a p-time
reduction.

   I keep harping on the fact that part of the proof relies on mapping
one NPC problem into another NPC problem, but that this mapping
doesn't need to be p-time in the general case.  I do this because it
is so easy to lose that point.  There are two similar problems to be
solved.  The transformation required in the proof only needs to be a
finite transformation to a known solvable problem.  The transformation
to a coNP problem must be in (presumed) P.)

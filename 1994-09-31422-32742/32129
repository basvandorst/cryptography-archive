By your own argument, improper means includes breach of a duty to maintain
secrecy (see above). Thus theft is not the only improper means which would
 be "catching" to a third party; so would violation of a license agreement.
Since all legal copies of RC4 carry a license agreement prohibiting
publication or reverse engineering, the only possible way to get a copy and
then reverse engineer are theft (as you say) or license violation. Thus any
third party use is misappropriation under this law.

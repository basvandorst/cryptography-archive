What is the benefit, if they have to look up something in the central
database they might as well look up the pin.  I don't believe the offset
could be stored on the card in this case as they did not have any real
control over the numbers I selected and the phone number was assigned
to me first, They do not have access to any other numbers on the card
at the time I make a phone call.

Jim...

P.S.  I believe people cracking the code is the reason that Ameritech has
      gone to selecting your own pin, but I have no foundation for this
      belief.

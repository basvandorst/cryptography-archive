   This approach doesn't seem to work too well designing 128-bit hashes
out of the 64-bit hashes that are easy to do with DES or another 64-bit
block cipher.  See Schneier's section on one-way hashes in _Applied
Cryptography_ for some of the schemes that have been broken that involved
a lot more complicated interaction between the hashes than this.
 
   The commonly-used method discussed in the book was to hash the document,
then prepend that hash and hash it again, to get a 256-bit hash from a 128
bit hash function.  This is more complex, but probably not as secure as
a real 256-bit hash function should be.  MD4 also had a suggested way to
generate a 256-bit hash, which you might want to look at.  Or, use SHA
with 160-bit hashes, or Haval with variable length hashes up to 256 bits.

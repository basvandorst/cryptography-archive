There seems to be a tendency to flame David Sternlight, just because his
political opinions are unpopular, without reading his comments with a
reasonable mind.

David said "Since RSADSI asserts ... either theft or breach of a duty
... must have been involved.". If you make the reasonable assumption
that, before the word "either", David meant "and you assume they are
telling the truth", then what is wrong with his statement ?

Now, you can argue that RSADSI's assertion is unlikely to be true, but
why flame David for that ?

Not necessarily.

But *if* the assertion of RSADSI is true, and your case 2 applies, then
*someone* broke the licence. David didn't say it was the reverse
engineer who did.

No. And I'm sure it doesn't apply to me.

Your statement number 2 makes it less than obvious that you *understood*.

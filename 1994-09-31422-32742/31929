Causal-based cryptograpy transmits a "cause" to a value-action-data
constellation, known as a "machine."  The cause will induce a movement or
conclusion in the machine over time.  Thus wearing a red scarf while
walking past a security camera, and having a car blow up in a parkinglot,
and a love letter sent to a head of state, can be fed into a causal
machine and its behavior monitored.  To crack the communication you need a
copy of the causal machine, and that is that.  If you don't have a causal
machine you are left with the "Department of Causes," which is a group of
people trying to explain the unexplained and the random acts of a causal
communication system with no success whatsoever.  A causal machine can be
a finite state automata, a value-based finite state automata, or a
combination of the above two with a rule-based expert system.   Other
computational models wait to be invented.

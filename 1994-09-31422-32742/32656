Not quite, the right to decompile is part of an EU directive and relates only
to interface descriptions, since RC4 is an interface description it is covered.
There is no right to decompile general chunks of VMS or UNIX (say). Except that
almost any code has some interface function and the point is moot.

According to my rather expensive set of British lawyers this is not the case.


David clearly has no idea about trade secret law. I am under no obligation to
RSA to protect their trade secrets since I have no contract of any sort with
them. If they have a contract with a third party who breaches it then
they have redress against that third party but not against myself unless
I induced the third party to breach the contract. If I buy a PC and Lotus notes
happens to be installed on the disk I do not have to find out the provenance
of the software just to decompile it. Shrink wrap software licenses are even
less valid when second hand.

By definition a trade secret that has been made public is no longer a trade 
secret. Regardless of the remedies that RSA may have against the parties who 
revealed the information they have none against innocent third parties. The
only route by which RSA may gain such protection is through application to the
government for a patent which in this case cannot be granted (prior publication
eg in Lotus notes).


The law is not as capricious as people tend to believe. The point about secrets
law is that employees and other persons working closely with a company
should not disclose its secrets. It is not a substitute for patent law,
it is at most an adjunct to allow development prior to a patent application.
The main application is in protecting data tables, employee records, 
business plans etc.



Anyway I'm adding RC4 to the Shen distribution tar which has some interesting
effects :-)

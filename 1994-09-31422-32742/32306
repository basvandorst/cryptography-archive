Indeed.  I do have a log, and my invention, in this case, is different 
enough that it really looks like an independent invention.  It is close 
enough, though, in some details, that I find it really amusing.  The real 
rub comes in, though, if, in working on my invention to improve it, it 
gets a little bit closer (in some subjective sense) to RC-4, but not an 
exact duplicate, of course.  Now that I have studied it, I have decided 
that I don't really like RC-4 exactly as it is, anyway.  RC-4 is no 
longer a secret, obviously.  Trade secret protection, if any, probably 
only extends for a limited time.

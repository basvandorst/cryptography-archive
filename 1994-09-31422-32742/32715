Constantly quoting U.K. law in a situation where U.S. law applies in the
U.S. isn't helpful. Many laws of the two countries, such as those of
defamation, etc. are quite different. Even the fundamental basis of law in
the two countries is different. Last time I looked you had no Constitution,
and the role of precedent was different. Your legislature and the process of
creating laws is also different.

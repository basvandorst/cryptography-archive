I've just got to the end of _Cipher Systems_, and hit the section on
key management.  It occurs to me that this is just another key
mangement scheme, and an amateur one at that.  For one thing, this
scheme runs right smack into the birthday paradox.  (See below.)

Nah.  Just the sender needs to.

To avoid confusion, I should have written ^ as XOR.

I retract that in a big way.

Here's where the scheme runs into the birthday paradox.  The expected
time before message keys collide is still pretty high for large
message key sizes, but nowhere near what I had thought.  (Or more to
the point, didn't think enough about.)

Also, knowing plaintext could allow an attacker to consider a number
of ciphertexts versions of a single plaintext encrypted with different
keys (in this case Pad[])

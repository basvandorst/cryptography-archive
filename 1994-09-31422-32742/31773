The pairs XOR table is one of the key elements of differential
cryptanalysis of systems which combine s-box output using XOR.  The
quoted paragraph pretty well describes what it is for an s-box that
takes m input bits and produces n output bits.

Perhaps if I describe how to build the table.

  set all entries of table to 0
  for i = 0 to 2^m - 1
    for j = 0 to 2^m - 1
      inputXOR  = i XOR j
      outputXOR = sbox[i] XOR sbox[j]
      increment table[ inputXOR, outputXOR ]
    
How is this useful in differential cryptanalysis, say of DES ?  We can
not predict the input to an s-box even in the first round because it
has already been XOR'ed with the key.  We can predict the XOR of a
pair of inputs being independently encrypted with the same key, since
the XOR with the key does not change the input XOR.

Now if we can find an input XOR with a high probability output
XOR, we have a high probability of predicting the input XOR of
the next round.  For more details, look up any of the papers on
differential cryptanalysis.

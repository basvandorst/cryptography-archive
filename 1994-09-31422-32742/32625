Not practically speaking with respect to RC4 if we assume the alleged
version IS the real thing, except perhaps for the NSA or similarly staffed
and funded organizations.
 
But I'd recede in the face of a more specific reply from some of the crypto
experts here. Perhaps your question might get a more authoritative reply in
sci.crypt.research, which I am adding to the distribution list for this
reply.

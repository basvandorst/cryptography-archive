Somebody correct me if I'm wrong. I have heard that the password itself
was not encrypted but instead was used as the key. Though there are ways
to invert ciphers with this scheme it is much more difficult to determine
the key if you know only the cipher and the clear text. The problem with
the rotor scheme was that it takes little processing time to do the
encryption making it vulnerable to key searches.

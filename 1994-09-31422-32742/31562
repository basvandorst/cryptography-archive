The reference I mention in my book is:

	P.H. Bardell, "Analysis of cellular automata used as pseudorandom
	pattern generators," Proceedings of the 1990 International Test
	Conference, pp. 762-768.

He showed that the output of a 1-D CA is the same as the output of a
single LFSR, and hence is no more secure.

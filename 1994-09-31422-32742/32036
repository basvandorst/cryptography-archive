Bignum libraries might perform better if you could do a series of
arithmetic operations one digit at a time.  That is, instead of:

	/* e = (a + b) * d */
	bignum_add(&a, &b, &c);
	bignum_mul(&c, &d, &e);

you write (roughly):
	
	for digits i = 0 to N,
		e[i] = digit_mul(digit_add(a[i], b[i]), d[i]);

This seems like it would use the machine registers much more
effectively for larger expressions.

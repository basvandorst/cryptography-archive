If the code is a trade secret, it doesn't make it less so
if someone improperly leaked it. And just for a spot of trivia
publishing it on the net "exported" it, a violation of 22 U.S.C.
&& 2778, 2780, ("export of arms, munitions, or military equipment
or services without required validated export license"),
acriminal offense whose base offense level is 22 according to
the United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines (Nov 93 edition).

An upward departure from that base is recommended in time of war
or armed conflict (e.g., Haiti).  A level of 22 corresponds to
a sentence of 41-51 months in a federal prison (no early parole).

In the federal scheme of things, this base is equivalent to aggravated
assault causing serious bodily injury or tax evasion of more than
$5,000,000.

(The sentencing table is constructed so that a change of 6 points
approximately halfs or doubles the base, depending on the direction;
Offense level 1 (no priors) is a few months in prison, level 43
is life in prison.

The question sounds a lot like 
" Agency A has a list of citizens' ID numbers 
" Agency B has a list of citizens' ID numbers
" How do they see how many people are on both lists without 
" identifying *which* citizens they're talking about?

It's just a guess, but that seems to be a plausible motivation
for this kind of question, and 999.999.999 is about the right length
for a Swedish citizen ID number (e.g. taxpayer ID, Social Insurance, etc.)
On the other hand, it's also about right for a university
trying to make similar calculations while preserving privacy.

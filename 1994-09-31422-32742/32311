He's talking about GOST something or other, the Soviet _analogue_ of DES.
There was some discussion of it here about a year ago, give or take. As I
recall the trafffic, it used similar approaches in some ways. There was also
a comment that a Russian in London was selling it commercially, but I don't
recall more.

The actual paper on GOST something or other was translated into English by a
U.S. company, and was, at one point, ftp-able.

"GOST" is Russian for "State Standard" or something similar. The Soviets
seemed to use "GOS" quite a lot as the start of the name of national
government organizations, as in GOSPLAN, GOSTANKINO, GOSTELRADIO, etc.

Perhaps another reader recalls more of the details.

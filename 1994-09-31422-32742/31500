I've had occasion to look into this.  Note that the following is from
memory.  Check before taking any action.

* According to the DTI, Encryption technology in the UK is considered
  "dual use".  This puts it in the same catagory as machine tools that
  can be used to make guns.  They will grant an export license
  provided that you can convince them that it is not going to be used
  for military purposes by regimes we don't like.

* The DTI are much more liberal with exports of encryption technology
  if it is used to secure commercial transactions.  So anything to do
  with banking is probably OK, even if you are exporting it to Iraq.
  You still need an export license though.

* The DTI do not try to control stuff that is in the "public domain".
  I gather that this includes things available over-the-counter as
  well as free software.  PGP is definitely in this category.

* BABT have no opinion on what gets sent down the phone line.  Their
  job is to make sure that your equipment does not screw up the phone
  system.

* I have heard that you can send anything down a phone line, but in
  theory BT have the right to demand that you replay the conversation
  in clear (how they are supposed to enforce this I don't know).

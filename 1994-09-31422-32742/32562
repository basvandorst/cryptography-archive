It has already been confirmed that the published RC4 is the same
functionally as RC4. Thus as far as any user is concerned that is all
that needs to be known, and as far as damage that is what did the
damage. The question here is whether or not the publiched RC4 is
identical to the RC4 source code in explicit expression. I do not see
how that could increase the damage to RSA. In fact it might be argued (
how persuasively is up to you to decide) that it eitehr does nothing or
lessens the damage. If we all know that the publiched RC4 is in
expression identical to the RC4 source, then some people may well
refrain from using an item which was clearly stolen. So you pays your
lawyer (not me I'm not one) and you gets your argument. On the ohter
hand the report is that it is not the same. Does that constitute
violation of the trade secret or nondisclosure? Is a black crow a
confirming instance of the proposition that all cows are brown (to bring
up an old philosphical conundrum)?

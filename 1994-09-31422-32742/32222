   Have any of you folks ever listened to peoplee handing out advice on
encryption packages (maybe on a bbs, or read it in a magazine), and come
to the terrifying conclusion that these people were passing themselves 
off as experts, maybe innocently, without actually understanding their 
topic?  I have this vague fear that something similar happens when people
who don't have some legal background give legal advice.  [This is much worse!
I can take or leave bad advice on encryption packages, but I know almost 
nothing about law!]
   	
   Has anyone either consulted with a real lawyer about this, or gone 
to law school out there that has an opinion on this they'd like to share?

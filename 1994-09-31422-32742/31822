The problem is that it is pathetically easy to decrypt an algorithm with a
keyspace of 2^24. Expecially if you have some known plaintext, or you
know something about the plaintext (for example, it's all english). Then,
you can trivially write a program that tries each key, and decrypts
the encrypted file just enough to tell if this key works, prints out
the key it is does, and goes on. On a fast machine, the attack
wouldn't take more than a day.

One other problem I see with your code is that you are using the BASIC
RND function. The main problems with using this function are:

 #1: The RND function is notoriously weak.

 #2: The implementation varies, so you could run into the problem of
people running two different versions of BASIC not able to transfer
files because their RND functions aren't the same.

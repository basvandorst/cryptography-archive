I don't think your being paranoid and obviously neither does
BT/MCI/Concert.  They now have a Global Network Security Offering that
includes encryption, security reports, consulting and user authentication.
 The encryption for the Tymenet is TCC's Cipher X 5000A with DES
encryption and centralized ANSI X9.17 key management.  Any or all of these
services are available as optional services.  If you or anyone needs a
contact at BT/MCI/Concert let me know.

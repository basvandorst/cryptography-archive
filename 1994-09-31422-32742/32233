I'm sorry, but I couldn't resist that bait ;-)

The reason Californian Law should apply is because David believes that 
law to be applicable everywhere. This is in the same spirit as the reasoning
that the US will invade most of Europe because US and European Law doesn't
agree on the patentability of Software Algorithms.... :-)

I would love to see California invade the rest of the US to get some 
"illegal and criminal" programmer extradicted to Los Angeles.

As I said, I just couldn't resist it. I wont take any more bandwidth from this 
discussion.

Apparently YOU don't understand much about patent law.  There is no penalty
for failure to prosecute a patent except possibly the doctrine of laches,
which would (at most) only prevent them from prosecuting the same persons
whose infringement had been brought to their attention, and they had
decided not to prosecute.  I'd extend this newsgroup list to include
misc.int-property, where this has already been discussed to death, but I'd
rather shrink it to alt.security.pgp, where it belongs.

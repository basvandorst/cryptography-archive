There has been some debate recently over the propriety of David's
posts to sci.crypt.  It has been suggested that his posts are too many
in number and off-topic in subject.  I decided to take a stroll
through the archives to find the truth of the matter for myself.

Out of 442 posts in my news spool, 53 were by David; that comes to
just a hair under 12%.  Of those 53 posts, 51 were primarily legal,
personal or otherwise non-technical.  Of the two remaining posts, one
briefly discussed GOST and one consisted of several lines of quoted
material with the statement 'PGP does not use RC4' added at the end.

As far as I can tell, this last post is the most technical
contribution David has made to sci.crypt in the last few weeks.

I leave interpretation of these findings up to others, and any
possible change in behavior up to David.

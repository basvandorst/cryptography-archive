I read an article in Pop. Mechanics saying that the Clipper chip is being
petitioned against by some organization...some four letter acronyme...anyway,
how can I sign?

It seems that skipjack (Clipper's code) sucks, and that would be bad for the
U.S. citizens. In addition, it gives the gov. more control than it really
needs.

One more question: if I coded my phone call before it entered the clipper
chip, wouldn't that give me a secure phone line? (and the reciever decodes it
after exiting of course)


Thanks,
Dani

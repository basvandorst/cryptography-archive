   WASHINGTON, Sept. 7 /U.S. Newswire/ --  On Friday, Sept. 9, the
National Archives will make available to the public approximately
3,375 translations of Japanese diplomatic messages, 1934-38,
transferred from the National Security Agency.  These original
records will be available in the Central Research Room of the
downtown facility located at Pennsylvania Avenue between 7th and
9th Streets, N.W.
   These cryptological messages from the Japanese cipher known as
RED were sent from Tokyo to Japanese missions abroad, including
Berlin, Rome, London, Washington, D.C. and Peking.  The messages
cover a variety of subjects, such as the invasion of China and the
emergence of military hardliners in Japan.
   The National Archives Research Room hours are as follows:
Monday and Wednesday 8:45 a.m. - 5 p.m.; Tuesday, Thursday and
Friday 8:45 a.m. - 9 p.m.; and Saturday 8:45 a.m. - 4:45 p.m.
Standard research room procedures are enforced.  All researchers
must have a research card.  Personal property is not allowed in the
research room.  For information about the records call the Modern
Military Branch at 202-501-5385.

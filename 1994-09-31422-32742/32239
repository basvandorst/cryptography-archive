You correctly identify one of the weaknesses of trade secret protection, as
distinct from patent protection. It does not protect against independent
invention of the same thing, or something similar.

However, you'd need to prove in court that you didn't have access to the
trade secret in making your invention. That's why many companies use "clean
room" procedures in deliberate re-inventing.

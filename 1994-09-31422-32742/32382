Companies use trade secrets for many reasons. In a paptent you must
diclose the details of your process. This may make it easy for your
competitor to either improve on you or to work around you easily. Your
secret may be prior art ( but not obvous). A Ptent may not be worth the
time and money required.  Or the technique used could be so stupid that
you don't want to expose your incompetence to anyone else. 
If you keep your process secret noone knows how you do what you do- it
could be trivially easy. If you patent you have to let everyone know how
you do it and finally may not even get the patent leaving you completely
exposed. A Trade secret is not simply a patent by another name. It has
its strength solely through its secrecy.

However I do agree with the last sentence.

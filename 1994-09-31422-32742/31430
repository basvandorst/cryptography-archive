A nice question. Consider how one does multiplication of (say) 2 six-digit
numbers ABCDEF x GHIJKL. One computes L x ABCDEF, then K x ABCDEF etc.
In multi-precise arithmetic, each letter is typically a number < 2^32
(or 2^31 etc). So to multiply L x ABCDEF takes 6 separate multiplications
[with attention to carries etc.].

This is a total of 6^2 multiplications.

To do ABCDEF x ABCDEF compute F x ABCDEF, then E x ABCDEF. oops!
We have *already* computed F x E, so we don't need to do it again!
Thus, by remembering the cross products we only need 6 Choose 2 = 21
multiplications instead of 36. (n(n-1)/2) instead of n^2. A savings
of a little less than half.

:>2. Montgomery Multiplication. This is cool because you avoid doing
:>   mod/division, which is really nasty.
 
Yes. But Peter's terrific method isn't always faster. It trades 
a divide for 2 multiplies and depends on the relative div/mult 
speed of your machine.

:win from this because of all the precomputation you need to do.
 
On average about 1/2 the bits in the exponent should be even
[resulting in a squaring operation]. Why do you say "only a
few times]?

:For decryption, it certainly seems like a win.

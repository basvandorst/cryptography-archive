Let's be 'for real,' folks.

Nothing is sacred. There are many, many experienced enough to
disassemble functional binaries into ledgible source, or similarly
function assembly. Hell, I've been doing it for years.

Does this requisite a criminal? No.

You put it into the public domain, regardless of statute, it gets
scrutinized. (Public Domain, in this case, meaning that it is freely
available to the public, regardless of purchase.)

Cheers,

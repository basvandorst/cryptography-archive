*sigh*

Since the US became a signatory to the Berne Convention (in, what, '78 or
so?), disclosure is NOT a requirement for copyright.

ALL WORKS, from the moment they are created, are copyrighted in the US now.
You do not have to deposit it, or stick in the word "Copyright," or
anything.  Unless you explicitly place it into the public domain, it is
copyrighted.

The law of the US still grants some additional protections to registered
copyrights, namely in terms of damages.  However, you do not have to have an
entire work sent to whatever office handles copyrights (PTO, I think, but
I'm not sure); you can include just the first bit, and the last bit (<x>
number of lines or words from the beginning, and <y> from the end), and that
suffices.  If you want to register a copyright on trade-secreted code, you
CAN do that -- just place in lots and lots of comments at the beginning, and
lots of meaningless stuff near the end.

But it needn't be registered to still be protected by copyright law.

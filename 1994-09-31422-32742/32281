All versions of PGP have a limited key length. So you probably mean
that your problems are that the key length in PGP versions > 2.4 is
smaller than in the earlier versions (i.e., 1024 bits instead of 1264
bits). Please provide some scientific arguments to substantiate your
claim that 1024 bit keys are not secure enough. As a beginning,
provide an estimation of how much it would cost to break a 1024-bit
key, using the best of the known technology and making reasonable
assumptions about technology and algorithm improvements in the next 50
years or so.

First, it is not RSA, it is RSADSI. You obviously mean the company;
not the algorithm. Second, I agree with you - my oppinon about them is
rather low too. Third, this is rather irrelevant to the point whether
the new versions of PGP are secure - because they have been created by
Phil Zimmermann; not by RSADSI. The only thing RSADSI has to do with
the creation of MIT-PGP is that they have finally agreed to provide a
free license for it, and that the program uses a library for some of
the functions, which is developed by RSADSI. Are you trying to imply
that some of the functions that are used from this library contain
security holes? I am ready to believe you. The library comes in source
and I have it. Please point me where the security holes are.

Now, now, now. Have you ever *looked* at it? *What* RSA-supplied
binaries? MIT-PGP comes in full source - and it couldn't be otherwise,
if you want to run it on many Unix platforms. Second, using 4096-bit
keys (as you seem to suggest) will make you incompatible with the rest
of the world, including the part that still uses PGP 2.3a.

OK, that would be about 512 bits, and I am probably heavily
overestimating it, but I like to play on the safe side. You didn't
specify such things like cost, time, memory speed, and so on, so I
couldn't hope for a more exact estimation anyway.

> multiply it by four. 

OK, that makes the keys be 514-bit long. You mean, your rule with
slime like NSA/NRO is to use 514-bit keys? Nahh, they look too
insecure to me, especially if one has to rely on them for a long time
- lie 50 years or so. I'll stick to something better - like 1024-bit
keys, thank you.

> Anything less is childish.

Definitely. Like the posts of the paranoid ignoramuses who don't have
a clue about factoring of large numbers and even cryptography in
general, but enjoy talking about "spy stuff"...

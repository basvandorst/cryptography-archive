The American Codebreakers, by Thomas Parrish, a very good book on
ww2 crypto history, gives some references.  

Bertrand Gustave, Enigma: ou la plus grande enigme de la guerre
(Paris: Plon, 1973; trans.: "Enigma, or the biggest enigma of the war".)
Predated Winterbotham's "The Ultra Secret" by a year or so.
"...a  thorough and explicit story of the assault on the German
enciphering machine as seen from the French side... it was not in English
an so it caused no stir in Britain or the US.... The Infernal Grove [1973],
a volume in Malcolm Muggeridge's autobiographical series... was thought
to be literary, not military-historical... hence his account of people
at Bletchley Park... did not attract students of the subject...

  "In earlier years Polish publications had contained some Enigma
revelations, but if books in French and even English were ignored, 
journal articles in Polish had little chance of making even a ripple."

Parrish does not give references for these Polish articles, but you
might check Deavours and Kruh's book on cryptographic machines, which
has a lot of WW2 stuff including an interview with Marian Rejewski.
(My copy is not handy).

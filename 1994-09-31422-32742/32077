Somebody quoted J. Bidzos, representing RSA, as follows:

>    It has come to RSA Data Security's attention that certain RSA
>trade secrets, in the form of confidential and proprietary source
>code, have been misappropriated and disclosed.

In other words, he's saying that the posted RC4 code is *not*
just code which duplicates the functionality of RSA's code.
He's saying that the actual posted code was stolen from
RSA. If that were the case, my sympathies in the matter would
be entirely with RSA. The big question is: Is Mr Bidzos telling
the truth?

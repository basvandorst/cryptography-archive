   Having read about this in this group, in the NY Times and the Wall St.
Journal, I have a question:

   BOTH the newspaper articles mentioned that the security of the system
could have been compromised by this disclosure.  Discussion in the group,
of course, has been revolving around other issues.

   If I understand correctly, there is no reason that the RC4 algorithm's
disclosure should hurt the security of RSA-encrypted information.  (cite:
Dorothy Denning's textbook, Clipper discussions, et cetera.)  

   My questions are:

        What damage is being caused to RSA by the (cryptographically ignorant) 
         Press's association of this trade-secret loss and the allegations of 
         insecurity?

        With regard to any and all damages to RSA (see previous question), _cui 
         bono?_  Who stands to benefit from this?

        With regard to the previous two questions how should RSA (handle, have 
         handled) this situation better, with an eye towards protecting their 
         good image as a strong cryptography provider in the free (and easily 
         misled) market on-the-whole?


   Thanks, all!

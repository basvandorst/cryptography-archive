You're wrong then.

It used to be true that a bank could send you a credit card with the 
option of sending it back, or using it, in which case, you would then be 
bound to their terms.  Laws have been passed, and now, instead, they send 
you a letter that basically says "You're pre-approved for a credit card.  
Just sign this form and return it to us and we'll send you your card 
right away!".  Getting an unsolicited credit card in the mail now, and 
using it would leave the bank to cover all your expenditures.  I don't 
know when the change when into effect, but I think it's been around for a 
few years.  I can probably dig up the exact date at work.  Unsolicited 
credit cards are a no-no.

Of course, it hasn't been that many years ago when a merchant could ask 
you for a phone number.  They can't now.

And yes, I do know whereof I speak, since I work for the Ohio Department 
of Commerce, of which one division, the Division of Banks, is responsible 
for the regulation of state chartered banks.

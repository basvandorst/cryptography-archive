ftp to cts.com in the /pub/straits/ area for ciphertext in
the following systems:
"vigrotor"
incomplete columnar transposition

These examples are not intended to require state-of-the-art solution
methods, nor to be too difficult for anyone on the net.

I may add more material later. If I get more time, I'll document
the rules I tried to follow in the examples, but I haven't done
anything too strange.

Plaintexts are public domain and may begin in mid-word.

Questions and comments are welcome. (Unless I post later to the contrary.)

Please note that this is a _sci_ group and that puzzles in easy systems
(like these) are a borderline topic, since they can be viewed as either 
recreational or instructive.

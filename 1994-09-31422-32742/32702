Is there any market for RC4?

You need RC4 if you want to clone BSAFE or TIPEM. But you also need
certain patented algorithms. It'd take years in court, and perhaps a
million dollars, to prove that RSADSI's patents are invalid.

If you have the time and money to spend on such a court case, surely you
can spend a few hours to reverse-engineer RC4 for yourself.

Jim, last February 8th, I posted a very similar suggestion.  It involved
7 wheels, (circular buffers) each stuffed with a different set of random
bytes.  To en/decrypt, the 7 "top" bytes were XOR'ed together to create a
single XOR key byte.  This would be XOR'ed with the plaintext, and the 
wheels would each be rotated one position.  This created a key that was n1*n2*n3*...*n7 bytes in length, and had a keyspace of 8*(n1+n2+...+n7)
bits.  The discussion went through several iterations of improvement,
with source code posted, and some pretty (apparently) knowledgeable people
putting in their two cents' worth. (John Taber and Peter Boucher, if I
recall properly).  I'd be glad to send copies of the message stream.  I
have it around here somewhere...  

As I recall, an individual named Colin James (the Third, no less) claimed
to have patented the device, and started threatening and attempting to bully 
most people who said they had used a random number generator and the XOR
operation in their favorite crypto technique.  Patent infringement, and all,
you see.  Ibelieve the general consensus was that his patent had not
adequately explored prior art, and was, in all likelihood, undefendable.

(No doubt, he'll resurface, now, insinuate I'm a liar and an otherwise
heinous dude, and threaten to sue me for character defamation, or something.)

Anyhow, I just wanted to let you know that this sort of concept has been 
discussed at length, with quite a bit contributed to the discussion by people
with expertise.  The way to spark this kind of discussion is not by pissing
on other peoples' corn flakes just because they assumed you were yet-another-
crypto-newbie proposing 

             while (!(*message)) printf("%c",*message++^(rand()%256)) ;

Yeah, okay, they pissed on your corn flakes first, but you ought to admit that
such a posting, unless clearly stated otherwise, is assumed to have come from
YACN.  The message is, if you want assistance and/or suggestions, be nice,
and be tolerant.  If you don't, then why post at all?

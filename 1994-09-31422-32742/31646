I take a doctrinal view that any information transmitted over a public
network must be considered in the public domain unless it is encrypted.

Some of my comms engineers are trying to persuade me that we don't need
to encrypt data sent over BT-Tymenet because the proprietary protocols
make it "almost impossible" to intercept anything.

My "paid to be paranoid" mentality won't buy this, but I want to be 
open-minded, and there has been all the fuss about GSM digital telephony
and government concern that the traffic couldn't be intercepted.

The information we are talking about could be of interest from a strategic
economic point of view. It is also being transmitted to a country where
we have competitors and there is an excellent COMINT service.

I want to know, does modern DSP technology reduce the need for security?

Thanks,
Mark Ames

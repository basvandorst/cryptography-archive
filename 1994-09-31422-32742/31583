John Kelsey posted a attack on a simplified three-round version of Blowfish,
but I don't believe he was able to extend it to more rounds or even the
comoplete version of three-round Blowfish.  Various "name" cryptanalysts
have looked at it, but none have looked at it long enough for either them
or me to feel comfortable with anything even resembling a pronouncement.

The contest is still going on, and a prize will be awarded to the best (not
necessarily successful) attack received by next Spring.

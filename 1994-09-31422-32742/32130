On the contrary, if we accept RSADSI's statement that all legal copies carry
a license agreement not to publish or reverse engineer, then the only way
the person leaking could have done so is improperly--either by theft or by
violating the license agreement.

As for "trade secret" it's a term of art referring to the material--it is
still a trade secret in law even if someone has improperly exposed it.

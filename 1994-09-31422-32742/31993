Reviewing the pgp docs, there is a reminder about traffic analysis.
Ideally one would like to broadcast "noise" files so they can be
intercepted covertly.  Newspaper ads are one route; steganography
in pictures or sounds is another.  But alt.noise postings would get
scrutinized and poster and readers could be tracked.

One could hide info in an image, sound, or movie on one's Web page, and
there might be enough browsers about such that readers couldn't be easily
tracked.  Similarly with ATT's low-cap steganography in postscript files.

Other ideas?

Most people I've talked to consider shrink-wrap contracts to be worthless.  
Even if they ARE binding, there are several ways around it, such as having
someone else open the box and then hand it to you, or having a minor open
the box (minors are, of course, unable to enter into contracts.)


At the worst, violation of a shrink=wrap contract, IF it is enforcable, is
simple breach, and a civil matter.  I see nothing wrong with distributing the
algorithm.  Distributing a specific implementation of source code may violate
copyright laws, but nothing more.


Just my $.02

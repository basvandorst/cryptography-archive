No law is "settled law". The same statute can and is reinterpreted to
suit changed conditions, or even legal fads. All you can go into a court
with is an argument. Sometimes things stabilise for a while, but in this
whole area of computer or software law, I doubt that legal stability is
the first term that would come to a lawyers mind.

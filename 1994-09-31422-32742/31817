Here is my $.02 on the subject:

SecureDrive: good IDEA cryptography, slightly clumsy UI, implemented
as a TSR so some programs that try to do disk i/o directly can get
confused, generates the bulk encryption key directly from the
passphrase, rather than using passphrase to encrypt a "session" key
that is stored in encrypted form on the disk.  Thus you cannot change
passwords without re-encrypting the whole disk, and someone who cracks
the key on one of your disk gets the contents of -all- your disks,
even if he didn't crack your passphrase.  I use this program on a few
dozen floppies to conceal the contents from the idly curious, but if I
were *really* concerned about secrecy, I'd be worried.

SFS: implemented as a device driver (good), fast but relatively unproven
MDC encryption function with very large key space (maybe good, maybe
not), designed with extreme attention to security consequences of most
design decisions (good) though this leads very fancy design (not so
good); source code not available at least for older version
(unacceptable).  I won't run it because of the lack of source code.

SecureDevice: ??????.  I haven't looked at it.

If you use two long (256 bytes or slightly less) keys with a certain stream
cipher, and these keys differ only in the last byte (or so), then the
output streams from these two keys will usually not diverge for many bytes,
in some cases more than 100.

This means that if you have two plaintexts encrypted with similar keys that 
you may be able to decode the first parts of the ciphertexts. By 
exclusive-oring the ciphertexts together, the generated streams will cancel 
out and you're left with the exclusive-or of the plaintexts.)  If you know 
one of the plaintexts, then recovering the beginning of the other becomes
trivial.

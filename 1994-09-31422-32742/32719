Most remailers don't keep logs; that would defeat the purpose.  I don't
think RSADSI has a prayer of ever finding out who posted the code.  If
they had monitored all the network traffic into and out of the remailer,
they might have been able to correlate file sizes and timings.  But after
the fact, they won't be able to figure it out.

I used to think that their algorithms had "magic constants" in them that
were different for each implementation, so that they could trace origins
of a leak.  That seems not to be the case for RC4.

I doubt it nullifies any existing agreements.  Lotus probably bought the
rights for a one-time fee, so this isn't really an issue.  I see no reason
why a new company couldn't implement RC4 without getting a license.  Note
that RSADSI has ownership of the name "RC4," so there may be an issue there.

RC4 is very fast.  It hasn't received anywhere the same degree of cryptnalysis
as IDEA, though.

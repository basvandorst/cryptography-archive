The reason for using different spacing between lines was that it was much easier
to measure from a scanned version of the printed document -- especially after
fax transmission or whatever.  Didn't have to use too much of the channel
capacity for error correcting codes and that sort of things.  I think your
method is more suitable for ascii files (not printed pages) where word spacing
can be easily measured.

BTW, AT&T didn't need to large a channel capacity.  They wanted to encode serial
numbers in classified documents which doesen't require too many bits per page.

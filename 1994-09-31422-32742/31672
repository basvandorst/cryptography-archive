Another newsgroup was discussing the method Unix uses to encrypt
passwords for storage.  I posted that it used an Enigma-like rotor
scheme similiar to that used by the crypt(1) command.  Someone else
said it used DES.  After going back and checking the man-page for the
various password commands and function calls in SunOS 4.1.1, I found
that I was wrong and that it does indeed use DES.  My question is, did
Unix ever use a rotor scheme similar to that of crypt(1)?  I vividly
remember reading the man-pages for this in HP-UX about 7-10 years ago,
but no longer have access to an HP-UX system and certainly not the
version of HP-UX I was using 7-10 years ago.  Did I read the crypt(1)
man-page and extrapolate to the password encryption scheme by mistake?
Could somebody who knows this sort of thing tell me if Unix (any
version, BSD-based or Sys V-based) ever used a rotor scheme to encrypt
passwords, and if so, when did most versions change this to DES?
Email would be great unless everybody else seems to have this same
question burning in their soul.

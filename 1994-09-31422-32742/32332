>(Crossposted to misc.legal.computing for the monthly "shrink-wrap" debate,

      There's another interesting side to "shrink-wrap" issues, which is
whether terms on a purchase order override terms on the merchandise.
If the P.O. said it was a sale, and the seller shipped and accepted
payment, it may well be a sale, regardless of anything in the package.
The same applies to warranty disclaimers.  Check the UCC.

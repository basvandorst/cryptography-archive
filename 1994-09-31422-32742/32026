I am the French fellow. Minor correction: the rate of 500,000/sec
is for a 486/50, as I indicated in my article posted to sci.crypt
on Dec 14th, 1993:

   More precisely, I tried, with the help of a small team, all passwords
   consisting of printable characters (decimal 32 to 126) of length 7 or
   less.  We did not have enough cpu power to try non-printable
   characters.  (With the 1000 Mips years already spent on factoring
   RSA-129, the full search would have been a trivial task).  My password
   cracker tries about 500,000 passwords per second on a 50Mhz 486. It ran
   for several months on about 30 PCs or workstations.

Good luck. I will give you access to the source. Please post to
sci.crypt how dramatic your improvement is once you have measured it.
For other people who like to use my code, please note that it was
written specifically for the pkzip contest, and thus works only on
files encrypted with pkzip 1.10. It does not work for pkzip 2.04.
Also, the user interface is extremely primitive. In short, my
program now has only historical interest; don't expect using it
to read your neighbor's files.

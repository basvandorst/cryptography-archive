You say we could not have invented it and you are right! For how many
people have the genius of a Fermat to produce his little theorem...
though AFTER the publication of the original work on public key systems
(one way trap door functions) I suppose anyone could have sat down and
looked through some books with exercises in number theory and
combinatorics for calculations of functions and their inverses (such as
finding roots mod n) and noticed that:

by gum, the method for finding square roots mod a composite says "first
factor n"! Perfect to use in the already published algorithm!

(then do a literature search to see if there were better known methods)

(or cube roots... or e'th roots... RSA being the e'th roots, square
roots being Rabin, but for n=pq there are four square roots, so Williams
is Rabin with a specification as to which root it is)

The method of finding them... solving roots... old books on exercises in
number theory give them... and all start with "factor n" (any method of
solution with that is... clearly, perfect for the ALREADY PUBLISHED
protocol of public key cryptography).

No... while I agree that thinking up the idea of using one way trap door
functions for use in public key cryptography was brilliant, just
noticing problems that say:

To solve this, one first does <whatever>

and noticing that <whatever> was a trap door (one then checks to see if
their are other ways to solve it) is brilliant? No.

I think anyone looking at the original article and rushing out to find
something to patent could have come up with RSA.

But coming up with the idea of public key cryptography... that was
brilliant.

And of course, PKP now claims, that though they could not patent one way
trap door functions as public key cryptography (generically), because of
prior art (the published paper), once they had patented the first
practical implementation of such, it implied a patent on one way trap
door functions for all public key cryptography.

So I disagree... it is not hard to come up with something for a one way
trap door function (just read old exercise books on number theory and
combinatorics looking for one that uses a trick to solve a problem).
People have done so, and many have been broken using methods that had
not been the old methods (though, I guess we have to give Fermat credit,
for no one has broken RSA yet).

I do agree that the idea of public key cryptography is brilliant... but
many brilliant inventions were not patented (due to prior art)... PKP
does not want that to happen to these.

(I wish I could argue that I had a patent on signatures! ah the money!)
(electronically, PKP claims they do, which is why they challenge the
DSA)

RSA? Anyone (looking through old books on number theory exercises) could
have come up with that... but ONLY *after* the paper on public key
cryptography (and PKP wants their patents to apply to all public key
cryptography as well as preventing anyone else from finding a function
that says "first factor n" and using it... or first solve this part
(easy if you create the problem) then do something else).

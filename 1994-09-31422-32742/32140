Decompiling code is an archetypal form of reverse engineering.

My examination of the code makes me think it is the result of reverse
engineering, but I don't have any information about it other than what
was on the net.  I don't think it is RSADSI code because it has no
comments and it is not written in the same style as other RSADSI code
written by the same people (e.g. MD4, the different parts of RSAREF,
etc.).  Anyway, it should be easy to check this independently.
Someone with a BSAFE source license (I think such licenses exist)
should just compare the RSADSI source with what was posted.

I don't think copyright would affect this if it is a reimplementation.

That would be a pretty scary legal abuse, but I wouldn't put it past them.

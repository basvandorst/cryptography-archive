   Don't yell at me, I'm not the one who did it. ;-)  Seriously, I
don't know how the name discrete logarithms got hung on the problem of
finding roots mod N, but at this point the usage is established enough
that I won't try to fight it.

   Of course the problem of finding logarithms mod N can be reduced
to the problem of finding square (or other) roots, and vice versa. But
I think the name came from the algorithm for finding logarithms by
taking successive square roots.

Just found a couple more patterns in rc4 worth reporting.

The event mm[i]==i-rr[i] (mm from before the switch, rr from after)
happens about 2/256 of the time.  Here's why ...

1/256 of the time, the event happens by accident.
The rest of them time, 
  m[a]==b and m[i]==i-b.
  Switch, now m[a]==i-b and m[i]==b.
  r[i] = m[m[i]+m[a]]
       = m[b + i - b]
       = m[i]
       = b.

Another event: recall that when r[i]==r[i-1], m[i] == -1
2/256 of the time (should be 1/256).  Almost all of those
2/256 times (I haven't quantified "almost"), m[i-1] == -1
as well.  Also, when r[i]==r[i-1] if m[i]==m[i-1] it is almost
always the case that m[i] == -1.

Another trend: m[i] is 1 slightly less often than it should be.

Now, Bruce, surely I shouldn't have to remind you that if RC4 is published,
then the export licenses for shorter key versions lose their protection of
U.S. security interests since on the other end a recipient may drop in a
longer-key version of RC4 while maintaining compatibility.

Thus there would be reason to grant no more "easy" exports of short key
versions, and those were the only exports, as I understand it, to non-U.S.
parties (foreign subsidies of U.S. companies getting stronger versions). If
that happens RSADSI may properly claim substantial damages from this in the
form of lost sales. It may also damage several other companies who were
exporting products containing the "easy" export version, including Apple and
Lotus. We're talking big money damages here.

Given that in your expertise I think you know the above, are you sure you
posted the messsage I'm replying to rather than it's being a clever forgery?
Nothing personal.

How about a cryptosytem where the two communicating parties build
extremely detailed and dynamic models (that include imaginary and
excessive functionality) of each other's installations, and the only
information exchanged is the most obscure and smallest detail that would
set off a chain of causality in the reciever's model and tell the receiver
what the message is.  Thus, a massive air attack being planned by the
sender would be encrypted as "4 ounces of aircraft aluminum shavings found
under milling machine 4 at 4pm."  This fact would indicate machine tools
operating overtime, in preparation for an attack.  If it was done right
(perhaps some imaginary attributes to each facility  programmed in) I
think it would be impossible to decypher.  The reason I call it
"Empathetic Cryptography" is because each model empathizes with the other
and predicts an accurate response based on minimal information.  The same
thing could be done with models of chemical or plastic molecules--perhaps
giving life to all those chemical compounds discovered but never used.

I admit that such a method is better than many of the "fast
proprietary encryption algorithms" that some vendors try to palm off
on the public, but you're charging them a fairly professional price
for something that doesn't sound like a professional product.
After all, you've said your target market is people who want security,
but don't have the time/skills to understand a bunch of complicated
obscure encryption algorithms (a reasonable market to target!),
but it doesn't sound like you're giving them the knowledge they need
to use a one-time-pad system safely - in particular you're providing
it on a medium that really *encourages* reuse, rather than on
something that makes one-time-ness possible, like magtape.

What guarantees does your company provide to its customers that you
make two and only two copies of each CDROM?  Are you backing those
guarantees with some sort of bond?  What if the government tries to
subpoena your records - do you have a policy of compliance, or of refusal,
or of compliance with notification to your customers?  Is it  written
policy, and is it in the contract you make with your customers?

Actually, PGP will be just fine, though 10 years from now we'll
probably all be using 1024-bit or longer keys and 512-bit will be fading.
Faster machines will make that more practical.  
Why are you inaccuately badmouthing the competition?

Meanwhile, how many of your customers will have made sure to microwave
their CDs?  At the very minimum, non-eraseable "One-Time Pads"
need to be used in combination with some more eraseable method,
such as a password for DES-CBC on the random bits, so that someone
reading the bits later won't have enough information to reconstruct
the conversation, or drag the planted known plaintext through the
CDROM to find the starting point for that session?

Seems like a fairly obvious approach to one skilled in the field -
do you have some novel addition like a method to do two and only two
pads cheaply from the noise source?

Ackk!!  Do you even provide your customers with the schematics of your
radio-noise generator so they can see how the noise is captured and
try to make spectral measurements of things like bias, along with a
guarantee that that's what you *really* used?
I can take a simple generator X[i] = DES( X[i-1], K ),
which will produce nice random white noise, but you won't be able
to see that it's non-random unless you rent time on NSA's DES-cracker.
Or unless I tell you.  (or unless I choose a wimpy password,
and I can cut down the risks of either of those attacks by only using
the bottom 8 bits of the DES output as the "random" number.)

That wouldn't work, pace makers are made from thick film hybrid microelectronics
in which the ICs aren't in a package and are mounted directly to the substrate,
which means, anybody with a (really good) microscope and a pacemaker, code
reverse engineer the precious SkipJack algorithm, (that wouldn't be allowed to
happen!)  So they'd have to make an attachment to your pacemaker.  :)

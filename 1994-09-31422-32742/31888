David,

I think you misunderstood me. How do you think someone is able to 
manipulate phone cards if he knows in wich way the checksum can be
calculated ??????????? I hope you did not read my posting completely. 
Otherwise : Someone who has no idea of something or who is too
stupid to understand it should better shut off and not impute others 
a criminal intention !!! Perheaps your unfriendly reaction is the 
result of your "flammable gas for brains".

Just before I read your posting someone warned me by mail
"...Don't worry about Sternlight, he is the resident authoritarian
idiot of sci.crypt, everyone else on the group wishes he would go a
way...". You should think about it.

Greetings

Gerrit.

The following suggestion is a cross between book ciphers and
one-timee pads.  It is not state of the art but it might be useful.

The idea: use a commercial CD as your book.  You would need a CD player
with digital output.  To encode a char  you find
one of the many locations on the CD which contains that char.  That
location becomes your encoding.

A receiver must know which album to use.

The NSA must keep all albums and look for cleartext by converting with
each one.

I don't know how many CDs there are, but there are lots.

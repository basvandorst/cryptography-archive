Not being an attorney, I'll phrase some issues as questions for an
experienced attorney to answer:

Trade Secrets:

1. Is it legal to export contraband property--such as that which violates
trade secret agreements?
1a.  Same question for third parties who copy the property from a public
post.

Munitions Laws:

2. Since EACH export of RC4 requires an ITAR export license, is it legal to
post RC4 code where the poster knows it can be readily imported to another
country without a license? Does this constitute an illegal export?

In particular, if the poster knows the newsgroup goes to foreign addresses
automatically (or the mailing list does), has he violated the ITAR if he
posts covered material without an export license?

Imports:

3. Is it legal to import something known to violate U.S. trade secret
agreements?

4. Is it legal to import something known to have been exported in violation
of the ITAR?

This is another situation where I would not be surprised to see those who
are culpable get what they deserve.

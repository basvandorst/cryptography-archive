Nope, if it would come to Trial and it could be *proven* that he lied
it would kill his Case. If he lied, but it can't be proven (How do
you compare the Code in Question with other Code which has never been
documented except by a Company having an obvious Interest to manipulate
Things? Did they register Signatures of the Source somewhere? ;-), he'ld
have killed something else - a possible Competitor, if I may call
published Code a Competitor.

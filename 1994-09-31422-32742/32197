talk.politics.crypto is for discussion of ``the relation between
cryptography and government.''

Obviously this includes the relation between cryptography and law.

Such discussion does not belong in sci.crypt.

Sternlight is taking the creation of sci.crypt.research as an excuse to
drag down sci.crypt. Why am I not surprised?

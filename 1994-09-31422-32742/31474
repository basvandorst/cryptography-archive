So novel that you and me couldn't invent it.

It cannot be overemphasized that easy-to-understand methods are not 
necessarily easy to invent at the first hand.  And it is even more 
novel to invent an easy solution to a hard problem.

The only reasonable objection to the RSA patent I've ever heard is 
that their research was supported by taxpayers, but the profit due to 
the patent won't benefit the taxpayers much.

According to Bruce Schneider, _Untangling public-key cryptography_, 
Dr. Dobb's Journal, May 1992, the patent will expire on September 20, 
2000.

Throw us a party on that day. :)

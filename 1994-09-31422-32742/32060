Absolutely correct, Dan.  *IF* this RC4 source code was the 
product of standard reverse-engineering techniques, undertaken by 
someone who was NOT under NDA with RSADSI, then the dissemination 
of the source code is NOT a violation of trade secret laws.

However, *if* the source code is too similar to the source used 
by RSA in their implementation, it is vaguely possible that RSA 
could undertake a copyright infringement lawsuit against whoever 
wrote the code.  However this is much more difficult and much 
less effective than trade secret laws.  As simple as the 
algorithm is, it would be hard for RSA to prove that someone 
could implement it without looking very similar to their code.

U.S. courts, in both Accolade vs. Sega and Microsoft vs. Stac, 
have ruled that reverse engineering of a shrink-wrapped software 
product is not illegal.  In the Microsoft case, this was even 
despite the existence of a "do not reverse engineer" clause in 
the shrink wrap agreement of the software involved (MS-DOS 6).

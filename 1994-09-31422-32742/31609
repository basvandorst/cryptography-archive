Let's hope your company doesn't keep its own copies of the pads!
More to the point, the notion of trusting your company--regardless of
how nice and trustworthy you appear to be--is brain-damaged. Trusting
a third party to generate one's key material is a flawed idea. It was
funny when Brian Snow of the NSA offered to sell me "large primes,"
but not when a company seriously proposes selling one-time pads!

(I'd be interested to hear from your customers.)

The claim that "we all know even PGP will become vulnerable in 10
years or so" is bogus. It may become vulnerable, it may not. But
certainly 1024-bit keys will not fall only because of faster
computers--cf. the many postings here by Paul Leyland and others on
the security of RSA with increasing key lengths.

And there's alway the backup copy your company keeps? (Not an
insinuation that you are duplicitous, merely a reminder that of the
points above.)

I'll take RSA to using a pad that someone else generated. Strong
crypto is *not* about having "to trust someone..."

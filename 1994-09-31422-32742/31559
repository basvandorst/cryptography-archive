How do I choose constants suitable for Diffe-Hellman?
According to _Applied Cryptography_ n should be prime,
also (n-1)/2 should also be prime. g should be a primitive 
root of unity mod n. n should be 512 or 1024 bits long.
Are there any other requirements?

How can I choose such numbers? Are such numbers published
anywhere?

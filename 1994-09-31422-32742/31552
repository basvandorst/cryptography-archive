Sorry about the long quote - it was neccessary to capture the entire
thought. Anyways...

If you permute between rounds, the minimum number would be lower than
log2(n).

But I do agree -- the Life algorithm _seems_ simple because we've all
seen it graphically visualized, but really it looks quite weak and
inefficient.

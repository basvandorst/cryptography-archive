[very useful details on RFD, CFV, etc. for new big 7 newsgroups omitted].

1. Does this procedure apply to expanding the charter of an existing
newsgroup as, for example, by including legal issues with respect to crypto

2. Can you post the charter for sci.crypt as it was actually voted on when
the group was created?

Thanks;
David

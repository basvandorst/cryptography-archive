Something like this should go in the FAQ.

The quick answer (take your pick) is either "one-time pads" or "nobody knows".

There are hundreds of cipher algorithms to choose from, with varying speeds,
key lengths, and other properties.  Many of them have no *published* attack
better than brute force; therefore, the security against the best published
attacks of these ciphers is proportional to 2^(key length).  Examples
are DES (56 bits, not 64), IDEA (128 bits), triple DES (112 or 168 bits
depending on implementation) and MDC (512 bits, I think).  

The trouble is, nobody knows what *unpublished* attacks exist, discovered
or undiscovered.  If your favorite intelligence agency figures out a
way to break MDC or triple DES, they sure aren't going to announce this.
They'd rather read everybody's traffic than have people change ciphers.

Similarly, if the company that sells IDEA figures out that it is insecure,
they have a strong financial motivation to keep the attack quiet, so
they can keep selling it.

The only really secure cipher is the one used by the Allies during WW2
and supposedly still used today for the Washington-Moscow hot line:
the one-time pad.  That is, the genuine one time pad, not pseudo one
time pad, virtual one time pad, or any other ersatz substitute.  This
means a block of *TRULY RANDOM* data derived from a physical source of
randomness, that you combine with your message and never, never re-use.

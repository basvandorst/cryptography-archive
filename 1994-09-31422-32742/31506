But you should take 3^9 which IS 3 mod 15

(x^j=x mod n if and only if x=0 or j-1 is divisible by the multiplicative 
order of x mod(n/GCD(x,n)) [note this demands that x be relatively prime 
to n/GCD(x,n) which is true if n is square free)]
x^j=x for all x (mod (n) if and only if j-1 is divisible by 
lambda(n)=largest of the multipkicative orders mod n... this diviides 
phi(n) which is why phi(n) works)

(I posted a message with title pgp math up hwere some week or two ago on 
all of this)

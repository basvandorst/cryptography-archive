      Sure they have.  That's a 3-tape Vernam cypher.  2-tape
Vernam systems, with real paper tape loops, were used prior to WWII.
The key loops went round and round through paper tape readers,
and XOR units applied the key.

      One normally uses tapes whose lengths are at least relatively prime,
so the period of the output pattern really is the product of the lengths.
Note that 510, 508, and 506 are not relatively prime.  

      However, even with relatively prime key lengths, there's a technique
for cracking this class of cryptosystem.  Note that the key mixing is weak;
each bit of cyphertext is the XOR of three bits of key and one bit of 
plaintext.  The attacker knows which key bits are involved for any bit
of text, so this turns into a simultaneous Boolean equations problem.
The minimum text length needed is a few times the length of the longest
key for a known plaintext attack; a few times longer for English text.

      If somebody has a program for cracking 2-tape Vernam, it could
probably be adapted to crack this thing without much trouble.

      This is a weak cypher.

So, to summarize what I've heard so far:

So, essentially, RSADSI is screwed. The algorithm is revealed, but
they can't patent it. The source posted may or may not be copyrighted,
but anyone can roll their own version which would not be copyrighted
and use it freely, unless Trade Secret law say otherwise, which I've
heard several people say it doesn't...

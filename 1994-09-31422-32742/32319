Based on my understanding.. this is almost exactly correct.

Many legislatures have been lobbied into making it a criminal offense as
well... (in Florida, ss812.081 makes it a third degree felony.. without
the reverse engineering out.  Interestingly enough, the language is almost
word-for-word identical to the CPC statute.)

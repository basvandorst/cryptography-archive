Doesn't RSA also rely on the difficulty of calculating discrete
logarithms?  RSA encryption is computed like this:

	C = (T^E) mod PQ

and decryption like this:

	T = (C^D) mod PQ

where C is the ciphertext, T is the plaintext, E is the public
exponent, D is the private exponent, and P and Q are large primes.

Factoring PQ allows one to compute D and recover the plaintext.  But
couldn't one also invert the discrete exponentiation that is the
encryption computation?  If so, why do we hear all about how difficult
everyone _thinks_ factoring is but nothing about the difficulty of
discrete logarithms?

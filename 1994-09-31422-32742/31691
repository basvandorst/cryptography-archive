Let me take a wild stab. You use the pseudo-random-number generator build
in to virtually EVERY BASIC language. >smack head< That is the canonical
"I just invented a k00l neet0 encryption program!" that you learn to crack
in beginning cryptanylist classes. If it is, I recommend that you read some
books on cryptography and cryptanylyzing(SP). _Applied_Cryptography_ is a
very good one. I believe that the author even admits to making the same
mistake that you did.

DISCLAIMER: I'm sorry if my *wild* guess at your implementation is completely
off. NO, I have *not* downloaded your program. I don't want to waste my money
with CI$. I even once wrote an "encryption" program based on the same basic
premise before my friends "enlightened" me. (actually, it was based on 
fractals, but hey, pobody's nerfect. =)

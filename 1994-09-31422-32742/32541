Well, you asked....


First of all, its "big 7", not "big 6".  There's comp,sci,rec,soc,misc,news,
and talk.  

Second of all, here is the procedure to do this:  Your Request for Discussion
must be posted to the newsgroups news.announce.newgroups AND news.groups, as
well as crossposted to any other relevant newsgroup (probably sci.crypt, 
sci.crypt.research, talk.politics.crypto, misc.legal, and misc.legal.computing).

Followups should be set EXCLUSIVELY to news.groups, and ALL discussion should
take place there.  Many people in news.groups may either support your proposal,
trash it completely, suggest modifications, or remain ambivilent.  After a 
period of one month, you may then request a Call For Votes (CFV).  This lasts
approximately three weeks, with impartial votetakers (usually the USENET Voting
Volunteers (UVV)) doing the vote collection.  You need a 2/3 majority AND a
100-vote margin for your proposal to succeed, otherwise it may not be suggested
for six months.

I would also suggest, David, that you get someone else to sponsor this if you
really want this to go through.  The politicking on news.groups can get VICIOUS,
and I bet there are a fair number of people who will vote NO on a proposal just
because they see your name at the top (in case you haven't noticed, quite a few
folks don't like you.  Not a flame, merely a bit of advice.)

If you have any other questions, ask on news.groups.

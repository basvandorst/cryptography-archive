Well, Jim Gillogly quickly broke it, so there seems to have been more
interest in that then I thought.

I know what you mean, but I didn't think his first message was that
bad.  He took a different tone after being flamed.  Of course if he
read the FAQ he would have known better.

The FAQ also discourages challenge messages.  If we argue with
newbies, especially newbies who didn't read the FAQ, to the point
where we invite them to post such messages, then we've defeated
the purpose there.

I think most of us probably invented the pseudo-OTP.  That's why I
think we should use a more supportive tone with the next VOTP
inventor, while telling him it's an old idea.  You never know; there's
always that one in a million chance he may be the next Phil Zimmerman.

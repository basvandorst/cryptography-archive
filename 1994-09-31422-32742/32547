You did not say "in and of itself". And that is what the law says--that
reverse engineering ONLY is not a violation. But reverse engineering in
assocation with other violations mentioned in the same breath in the law
WOULD BE.

The case some have tried to make here is that if RC4 was obtained by reverse
engineering it is not a violation of law, but rather is exempted. That is a
one possible necessary, but not a sufficient condition for it to be
exempted. Other things must be involved as well, and are inextricably bound
to the statement about reverse engineering in the written law. Those other
things include that the item not have been obtained by theft, or by the
failure of a duty to secrecy. What is more, in a subsequent subsection, the
law makes clear that if the reverse engineer could be expected to know that
the item was obtained by another through theft or failure of a duty to
secrecy, then his reverse engineering is not protected even if HE wasn't the
thief or failee.

Thus it is false to state or imply that reverse engineering itself is prima
facie evidence that the violation is protected by law.

It is not a crime to receive stolen goods if you do not know that they are
stolen.  You are, however, liable to being ordered to return stolen goods in
your possession to their true owner and you can be held liable for damages
for converting those goods to your own benefit, even though you are an
innocent purchaser of those stolen goods.  But these obligations arise only
because the true owner has a right to the ``return'' of his tangible goods;
one can't let both the owner and the ``bona fide purchaser'' retain the same
goods--it is not physically possible.  But in the case of ``misappropriated''
information, both the owner and the bona fide purchaser can have the 
information without interferring with the other.  So there is no analogy, and
not even civil liability.  (This is why it leads to confusion to try to
analogize ''intellectual'' property interest to property interests in tangible
goods.  The remedies that protect the owner of tangible goods: trespass,
conversion, detinue, replevin, specific restitution in equity (and the criminal
action of larceny--which requires a trespass to tangible goods), all are
applicable _only_ to specifically identifiable tangible goods.)

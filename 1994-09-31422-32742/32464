I thought that the shrink-wrap/non-reverse license has failed in
both the Sega vs Accolade and the STAC vs Microsoft cases.  In
both of these cases, the defendant, Accolade and Microsoft,
disassembled machine code to gain information about a
competitors product but neither were found in violation of Trade
Secret laws.   Don't both of these case set precedence.

I believe that Microsoft was found to be violating a STAC patent
but Accolade was found to be violating no laws.

One time pads are hard to come by, right?


WRONG!!! The answer is RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU. You are staring at it. 

What is it? The internet. The information superhighway and so forth. BBSes.
What do they always have problems with? Try "too much information!!!" They
are always getting too much, and usually delete files or get more hard
drives.  Info- as in messages, usenet messages, BBS messages, files, from
ftps, from BBSes, from gophers, etc. All contain an infinite (yes, I said
infinite) amount of data flowing from that never ending facet of the
Information Age. 

Now, tell me that isn't a good idea! :-)

Tell your reciever where you got it and what file/or message you got.  Use
whatever encryption you like: XORs are lots of fun (fast) but recommended is
that you do some kind of scrambling of the pad so that it becomes less
predictable. (Simple and easy ways include adding adjactent charcters
together, or even coding the pad with a common password)

They can then get the pad whenever, and decode the message in full. The pad
size ranges from 1 bit to infinity. For even more craziness, mathematically
combine multiple files or messages. 

Any ideas comments or objections to this rather obvious use of the endless
flow of info?

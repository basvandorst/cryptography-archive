True... I multiplied the prob. that 2b+1 is prime times the prob. that 
4b+1 is prime to take into account both being prime... the restriction on 
their forms may provide correlation which makes the result an 
overstatement. But I don't think it is as bad as you point out.

By the say, by changing the form, one can guaranteee that 2,3,5,7 work on 
Fermat testing (not Miller Rabin) and of course the numbers DO work for 
PGP/RSA (that is, if n=PQ where P,Q are composites of the required form, 
ed=1 mod n, then coding with e will decode with d) (note that if n=PQ 
with the given form... it only shows factors on the order of n^(1/4) 
instead of n^(1/2)... that form does not lower the factors of n too much 
in terms of security... but it seems to me that a better primality tester 
is important.

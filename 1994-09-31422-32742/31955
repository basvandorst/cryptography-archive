Neat!  Thanks for the run-down.  How do these compare to Norton's
Diskreet, which is reasonably quick and compatible, and uses a
device driver, but which I've read (here somewhere) can be broken
fairly easily?  (How do you break it?  Is there an FTP address for
this?)
 
Thanks

Stamp out apathy...  aw, who cares.  Ambivalence is the TRUE opiate

I posted this earlier by anonymous post, because I just recently
discovered how to do it.  I would appreciate all advice and replies
to my problems.  To expand on my following note, when I do XOR'ing I
would be using a simple one at the bebinning to get acquanted with
the procedure and use something more complex.  Sorry for all the
inconvience my anonymous post caused.

The post from earlier starts as:

Hi,
  I am learning to program new things in C++, and have a few questions.
I wrote a small piece of code that did some XOR'ing on encoded text I wanted
to display on the screen.  It would be decoded and displayed.  How do I do this
in C.  Is there someway I could do this in one .exe file?  When I messed
around with it, I got the encoded message by running the program, piping the
output and pasting it into my c code.  Is there a better way that actually
works?

Also, I see that there is c code to do CRC checks.  How do I integrate this
into my C programs.  I want to CRC checks on my programs, to check to see if
no changes were made.  And I want to store the CRC info in the program to check
the program.  All help and advice is appreciated.  Thanks.

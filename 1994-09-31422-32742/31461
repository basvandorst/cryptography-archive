: Do you have any statistics on this latest set-up?

   I have cursory data from two byte-wide distributions.

   The first run was 125792 bytes. The mean was 491.375 and the std
was 21.6.
   The second run was about 452 Kbytes. However, I made an
unrecoverable error inputting data to my calculator somewhere after
the 160th entry, and have only a subset of even this limited data.
The mean in this subset was 1768 and the std was 42.4.
   Included in this limited subset was one interesting sequence--
bytes of hex value 99,9A,9B had counts of 1836,1862,1848.
Corresponding bytes from the first run were 498,477,495.

Nope. You don't have a say in how your taxes are spent, beyond your comments
to Congress and your ballot box behavior.

Additionally, the stuff was developed with both public and private funds,
and the nature of the property rights reflects that.

Most professional cryptographers would disagree. Your assertion is mostly
voiced by the loud "something for nothing" minority. If it was so simple,
why wasn't it though of sooner? A safety pin is both simple and patentable
(or would be if it was newly invented). The test isn't "simple" but
"obvious" and it was obviously not obvious since it was newly invented and
widely hailed as a breakthrough.

That's a meaningless noise. Define "overbroad". Show the patent meets the
definition. Show the patent laws prohibit such patents. It's not that the
patent is overbroad but rather that they have a number of patents which have
the field surrounded. That's quite a different matter, and is quite common.

Propagandistic nonsense, and defamatory to boot to the extent you are
suggesting that RSADSI is not doing business fairly and honestly.

Assuming you mean "We have to assume the public can hear us",
rather than "copyright is bogus, the electrons were just sitting there",
then, yes, you're right.  Some signals and protocols may be more
difficult than others for Bad Guys to eavesdrop on, but assuming
your data has enough value that you mind having it overheard,
encryption is the way to go.

I thought they basically used X.25 or similar standard protocols?
Even if they don't, you *can't* assume that they won't go upgrade
their equipment to something more modern that everybody can eavesdrop on.
Many of the protocols used internally by telephone switches are proprietary, 
but that hasn't stopped phone phreaks from cracking them over the years.
And if you're worried about governments eavesdropping on your calls,
or sending big money around, security by obscurity is laughable.

If you're being paid to be paranoid, BE paranoid, man!
I don't know if they're really out to get you or not :-), 
but if they are, they *can* get you.


] I want to know, does modern DSP technology reduce the need for security?

Modern DSP technology *increases* the need for security -
maybe your modems are harder to tap than the old-fashioned ones,
but there are far more resources available to tappers at reasonable prices,
and it's now feasible to have computers doing far more eavesdropping
than before.

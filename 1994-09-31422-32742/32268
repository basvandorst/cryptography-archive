Simply appalling.I though that after the past complaints about your reading
comprehension you would have taken a course or two. Apparently not. Reverse
engineering is not excluded from improper means. Read the law again. It says
that reverse engineering ALONE isn't improper means, but if it is associated
with theft, or with failure to honor a duty of secrecy, then reverse
engineering won't get you off.

Bidzos says that all copies are covered by such a license. Unless you are
prepared to call him a liar and back it up, you're simply wrong about the
first part of the above.

As to whether the licenses are valid or not, assertion that they're not
won't answer that question. THAT's spreading FUD.

You haven't been following this discussion. Jim says that all copies are
protected by a "no reverse engineering, no disclosure" license. Jim says that
the only way the code could have gotten out is by theft or license
violation. He is in a position to know; you are not and can only make up
stories. They cannot carry any weight with serious people, being unsupported
by any evidence.

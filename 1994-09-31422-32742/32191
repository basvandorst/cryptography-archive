I believe you are quite wrong here.  Once a trade secret is exposed, it is 
no longer secret, and the keeper of the secret has no rights to the "secret"
any longer.  He/she may seek relief against those who engaged in illegal 
activity to obtain the secret, but the fact remains that RC4 is now 
irrevocably in the public domain.

There have been cases where company A developed something and chose to keep it
secret instead of patenting it, and company B later legally obtained this
secret, patented it themselves, and were able to bar company A from using their
own invention!  The bottom line is that trade secrets are protected only as
long as they remain secret.

Any lawyers want to comment on this?

Well, I would have to say that the card numbers are looked up in a
database.  When I got my phone card, I was allowed to select the extra
four digit pin (The remainder of the number is just my phone number).
If the system uses a checksum to determine the validity of the pin then
I would not have been able to select a random number, it would have been
assigned to me.

On a similar note:

A person I know works for a VERY large company that has recently changed
their computer security procedure to include a changing four digit number
each person with an account on this system has a card with an LCD screen
containing a four digit number that changes every 30 seconds.  Have seen
enough of the cards to know that the numbers are not the same on every
card.  HOW SECURE IS THIS METHOD?  It seems to me that the computer could
not recalculate everyones password every 30 seconds. We are talking about
literally thousands and maybe 10's of thousands of people.  The number
generation algorithm has to be able to be implemented in hardware inside
of a card the size of a credit card card, and not thicker than 2.

Just wondering.

I just received the message about the new version of Tripwire, and
something there caught my attention. It says that Tripwire now has a
new cryptographic hash function, using Haval, which is believed to be
faster and stronger than MD5. I am not familiar with Haval; could
somebody who is to post a short description about why is it supposed
to be more secure? Does it avoid the pseudo-collisions in MD5? Are
those pseudo-collisions a real problem? I had the impression that they
are not.

Also, is Haval faster than MD4?

Regards,
Vesselin

That is, to put it charitably, wishful interpretation.  "It is reported" is
wonderfully passive language that really means "The Journal reports that
Jim Bidzos claims..."

Also, I can't find any reference in that article that indicated Bidzos was
referring to ITAR violations.  Bidzos was merely said to be asserting that
the FBI and US Customs are getting involved in investigating the alleged
trade secret theft from RSADSI.  They would do so solely because any theft
of trade secrets that Bidzos is alleging occured (when the alleged RC4 was
posted) might involve interstate or trans-national borders.

The original post in this thread thus uses innuendo about ITAR in an
attempt to cast FUD in the path of discussion about, and use of, the
alleged RC4 algorithm.

By a variation of the "Chinese Remainder Theorem", enough independent 
CRC's (Cyclic Redundancy Codes) can be used to reconstruct a message, 
without the message itself.  For instance, 32 different CRC's, (based on 
different "primitive" polynomials) each 64 bits long could be used to 
reconstruct any 2048-bit block.

If the CRC's are used as ciphertext, the polynomial set becomes 
the key.  I imagine this cipher would be completely linear and very 
vulnerable.  (Is this a variation of a "Hill" cipher?)

If any single bit of the giant input block changes, every CRC will change.  
If the CRC's are encrypted, with a "good" cipher, then changing any 
bit of the giant input block will cause about half the ciphertext bits of 
every output block to change.  I think this is what is called the avalanche 
property (a good thing).

CRC's can be calculated very quickly. So, suppose we took a 256-byte 
(2048 bit) message and calculated the 32 CRC's (each 64-bits long).  
Now, we encrypt each of the CRC's using, for instance, DES.  Assuming 
the polynomial set is publicly known, what is the effect on security?

Does this increase the effective block length of the cipher?

We still have only a 56 bit key.  Would using a different key for 
each CRC make this more secure?  Would it be a substantial improvement
over just using that many keys with conventional DES?

Would using such a system twice be substantially more secure than 
double-des?

Are there standard techniques for preparing a message to make
conventional encryption more secure?  I suppose compression
would qualify, as would removing punctuation and spaces.

If this idea hasn't been thought of before, then everybody is welcome
as far as I'm concerned, to use it as they please.  I'm not a 
mathematician or a cryptographer, though I sometimes fantasize.

Sorry, I couldn't think of anything to say about copyrights,
trade secrets, politics, or personalities.

RSA can "stuff RC4 back in a bottle" IF it was shown to be 
improperly obtained. I think RSA has to show a preponderance
of evidence that it was wrongly acquired. Reverse engineering
and independent derivation is not improper under California Civil 
Code 3426.1.  Meanwhile, RSA can continue to "stuff it".

Why would he lie? If it comes to trial, and there's good reason to believe
this one will, and he lied it would kill his case.

By the way, if you accept his statement literally (and thanks for pointing
out the phrasing--I didn't notice it) then all the stuff about reverse
engineering in our discussions of this become a red herring, and the problem
becomes the much simpler one of stolen trade secret (and copyright) code
having been disclosed, and then republished in whole AND part (as part of
the discussion of the code itself)  by third parties.

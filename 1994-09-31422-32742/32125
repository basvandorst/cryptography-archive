On saturday, 17th, the Mercury ran an article in the business section, "Secret
computer code appears on Internet". This article talked about the recent release
of RC4 work-alike code. The one thing that caugh my attention was the fact that
the NSA allows only RC4 to be exported in software titles. My question is, if the
NSA, who is pushing Clipper, allows RC4 to be shipped, do they have a key?. Or 
is the algorithym weak enough that their computers can easily break the
encryption. 

Any thoughts?

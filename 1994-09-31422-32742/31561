Does anyone have information about the results of attacks on Blowfish?  I 
understand that there was a contest held to see who could produce the best 
attack.  Are any results available?  Has the algorithm stood up to 
concerted attack?  How thoroughly has it been attacked?  What is the 
current judgement about how likely it is to be secure?

I know - I know, enough questions.  Thanks in advance.

Robert

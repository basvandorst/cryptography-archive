This strikes me as infelicitously worded.  Some other readers may wish
to avoid the time spent in sending e-mail.  The "free copy" in question
is a demo copy that reveals passwords only of one specific length.  This
demo version has not yet been "perfected."  For readers wishing a fully
functional version of the program, such a version is apparently available
now for around $100.  Sending e-mail will get you the details I got about
price and overnight delivery service for the fully functional version.

I am not a lawyer, BUT:

It is my understanding, that to maintain a trade secret, it must be
treated as a secret.  Selling copies over the counter to anyone who
will buy it, is NOT treating it as a secret.

Did they:

1 -- get prior agreements from purchasers that they will keep the
software under lock and key.

2 -- get agreements from purchasers that they will require users of
the computers on which the software is installed to treat the material
as trade secret.

Do they even KNOW who has a copy?

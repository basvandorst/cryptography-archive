I believe that Unix systems have been using DES since someone (my mind is
blank as to who) thought up that you didn't *have* to keep plaintext
copies of all of the passwords on disk, only 1 way hashed versions. The
reason they chose DES is because it was (at the time) very slow (about
1 second per password), which made a dictionary attack *slightly* 
inconvenient. I don't believe they ever used Enigma.

Not necessarily; I've seen numerous examples of contractual provisions
that were unenforceable because they were in violation of state law.
The author of the contract relied on the intimidation factor.  This
often occurs in residential leases, for example.

It's also worth noting that trade secrets are governed by state law,
not federal; we don't know in what jurisdiction the (alleged) offense
took place.  Furthermore, since some products containing RC4 are
(legally) exportable, under an expedited licensing procedure, the
reverse engineering might have taken place in another country entirely.
I have no idea what laws would govern such an action.  Also, the
alleged illegal export of RC4 might not have occurred; rather, the
source code would have been imported, which is legal (except, of course,
for any claims under trade secret law).

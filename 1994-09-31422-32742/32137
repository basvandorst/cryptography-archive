How can the recipient do that?  The short-key export permissions
do not permit source code to be shipped.

Also, I'm interested to know exactly how RC4 was supposed to be used
in the short-key version.  Simply passing a 5-byte string to the key
setup routine seems pretty weak cryptographically.  I wonder if it was
permitted to hash the 40-bit key into a longer string and use that
string to initialize the RC4 state.  This would still leave only 40
bits of real key space to search, hopefully keeping the NSA happy.
Anyone know more about this?

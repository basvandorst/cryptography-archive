        Spent the summer at the North Pole, did we? Do a news search
        on "RSA-129" to get back into the swing of things. Nobody
        "decyphred" RSA. They did, however, factor a small, 129-digit
        key using an approach that was more interesting than the
        accomplishment.

        Cheers,
                Marc

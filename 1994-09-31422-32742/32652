Thanks for clarifying this, David.  There was quite a bit of
speculation so it's good to see the actual law.

It says up there that a trade secret is something not generally
available to the public.  Since RC4 is now generally available to the
public, it is not a trade secret any more, according to that paragraph.

Unless I missed something, all the other stuff about misappropriation,
disclosure, etc. in the excerpt you posted have to do with trade
secrets, not former trade secrets.  They therefore don't apply to
people who got RC4 through public channels.

I'm glad you're on our side now.

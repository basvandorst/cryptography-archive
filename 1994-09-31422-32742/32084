I think RSA has to show that the code was misappropriated.
Reverse engineering is not improper means to recover a trade secret
according to California Civil Code 3426.1.

If it WAS improperly obtained then RSA and enjoin and recover double
damages and the person(s) illegally obtaining, possessing, or distributing
the secret might be subject to criminal penalties.

It seems to me that as long as export controls were followed as is
done for PGP 2.6.1, then a reverse engineered RC4 can be archived and
distributed just like any other bit of knowledge, RSA's loss of 
trade secret notwithstanding.

For legal advice, however, consult your attorney.

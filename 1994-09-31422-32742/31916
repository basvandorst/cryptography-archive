Do you assume Pad[] is as long as the message?  If yes, then why not just
do M[i] ^ Pad[i]?  If no, then the scheme depends on the strength of E_k,
which (if weak) will expose the Pad the next time around, even with a
new session key.  It's intractable (I won't say invulnerable for anything
less than a true one-time pad) only if E_k is cryptographically strong,
if I understand what you're saying.  "First we assume a cryptographically
strong hash function..."  I must be misunderstanding something, though,
since if your E_k() is strong, then you might as well be using consecutive
integers instead of truly random Pad[].

Another observation: if Pad[] gets reused from one message to the next,
there's a chance of a birthday collision on Ks^Km for anybody reusing
Pad[], even with a different Ks.  If it ever happens, it's easily
detectable by the cryptanalyst, and fatal to both messages.

Yeah, good thinking -- your theory is that JD is abandoning the name
after this week's exercise?  Does this mean Pad[] really is used only
one time?

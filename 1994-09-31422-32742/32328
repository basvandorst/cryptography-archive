I've just checked and it's in the posting queue now, the exact delay depends on
the time zone the moderator it gets allocated to is in, when they can get time
to approve the posting, and whether it needs editing (eg for broken return
addresses, which I've just done for another posting).  As a rule of thumb, you
can budget anywhere from half an hour to a days delay.

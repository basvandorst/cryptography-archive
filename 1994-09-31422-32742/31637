   Could some please point me to the relevant documents describing, in
   detail, the algorithms used in pgp.  I am particularly interested in
   the technique used to encrypt a single message (producing only one
   encrypted text message) for multiple users. 

Here is a decription of how a single message is encrypted to multiple
recipients in PGP.  A random IDEA key is generated.  This key will be
used to encrypt the message.  Then, this key is stuffed into a PKCS
format, appended with random padding, and then RSA encrypted for each
recipient (the random padding is unique for each recipient).  After
the key is encrypted for all the recipients and written to the file,
the message is encrypted with the IDEA key and appended to the file,
and that file is then ascii armor'ed (if you want) and transmitted to
the recipients.

Hope this answers your question.

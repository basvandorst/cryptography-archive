Hey, Grady, here's something to consider:

If you were RSA, and you got wind that someone was about to 
complete a clean-room reverse engineer RC4 and publish the 
results in a journal or something, how could you respond?  If you 
were reasonably sure that a true clean room was involved, then 
there is really no legal response.  Of course you could tie the 
person up in courts for years, but it is unlikely you could have 
any real effect.

However, if you could "taint" the results of the clean room 
efforts, you could make everyone steer clear of it without ever 
having to file a court motion.  How could you taint a clean room? 
 By dirtying it.

By publicly releasing the actual source to RC4, RSA could have 
deliberately sunk any possible future clean room efforts to 
disassemble the code.  How could anyone prove that they hadn't 
seen this code, and thereby prove they had a clean room?  

Personally, I'm not the conspiracy-theory type, but it does make 
one wonder.

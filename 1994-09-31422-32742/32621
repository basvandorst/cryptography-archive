Quantum cryptology is interesting, especially considering that poly time
algorithms do exist for a quantum computer (although building a quantum
computer is a non-trivial task).  Once (or if) a quantum computer is built,
public key systems such as RSA will be useless (as factoring will then be
easy).  RSA is considered secure because factoring is such a difficult
problem, as the power of computers grows, keys can become even larger, thus
increasing the difficulty to factor them (practically speaking).  

I would say that Quantum cryptology is of theoretical interest only. BUT
if a quantum computer is developped (or a brilliant person finds a poly.
time alg for factoring in a traditional computer setting) then the
importance of quantum cryptology will jump from simply theoretical, to
pratical.

Of course I could be wrong (I am just a rookie in this area)

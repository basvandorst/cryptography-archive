And just who is this Mr. Sternlight?  Someone who dreams of a world where 
the government can pry into everyone's live with ease and impunity?  Or 
perhaps, he has a vested stake in selling out to the NSA?  I am curious

<And if you throw up the tired old Paedophile Threat(tm) argument for the 
"need" for controllable/defeatable encryption technology, you deserve 
whatever authoritarian society you're brewing dude.>

Good point.  It also says "trade secret."  Alledged RC-4 is not now, nor
will it ever be again, a trade secret.  Nothing that has been posted
world-wide to usenet and advertised as having been posted in many major
newspapers is secret.  It used to be, before some unscrupulous person
stole it (or maybe it was legitimately reverse engineered).  If it was,
indeed, stolen, then the person who did so is in a heap of trouble.  Now
that this stream cipher is public knowledge, trade secret laws do not 
apply any more.  That is one of the risks of trade secret protection.

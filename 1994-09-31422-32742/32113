Say what?  We have no reason at all to think that the RC4 source was
obtained through theft, espionage, etc.  Most likely somebody bought a
product that used RC4, and spent a weekend disassembling it.  Your
argument appears to turn on this disassembly being a "breach of a duty
to maintain secrecy", on the strength of the product's probable
shrink-wrap agreement.  But it has been pointed out that shrink-wrap
prohibitions of reverse engineering have not held up in court.

Would you care to support your assertion that "it seems pretty
conclusive that there was a violation", or would you prefer to repeat
it instead?

Your concern for our welfare touches the heart.

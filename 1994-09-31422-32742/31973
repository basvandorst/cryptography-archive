No. Only a single, 429-bit key was broken.

Please try to get more accurate knowledge on the subject, before
starting to wander or to spread baseless rumors.

It took approximately 600 people (not all of them experts), using 1600
workstations about 8 months (spending many MIPS-years) to crack just a 
puny little 429-bit key. Increasing the key length by 10 bits 
approximately doubles the price of the resources that have to be
used to crack it, and most people nowadays use 1024-bit keys.

Well, you are wrong. Not only "a couple of Crays" - even all computers
that have ever been produced in the history of minkind will not be
able to break a 1024-bit key for a reasonable time using the best of
the currently known factoring methods.

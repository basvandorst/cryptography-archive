There is no deposit requirement under current law. Things are born
copyright.

In the U.S. there may be a provision that the Librarian of Congress may
request copies, but even there it's possible to maintain non-disclosure.

The reason many copyright holders deposit is to establish unequivocally
their date of copyright in case of a court case against another for
infringement. But there are many other ways to establish the date of
copyright.

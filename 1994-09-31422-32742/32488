In the interests of combatting continued disinformation, here is the mail
I sent to David Sternlight re: shrink wrap agreements.  I have edited it
only to the extent of removing his literal phrasing of questions and
replacing them with my paraphrase, as he has not yet given me permission
to post his mail.

Keep in mind that I'm not your lawyer, and am not giving specific legal 
advice; this is intended to be a general discussion of the enforceability 
of mass-market shrink-wrap licenses as I understand them.

Well, you should definately read the Vault v. Quaid case for yourself -- 
it's very interesting reading.  But to address some of your questions:

There was both a trial-court ruling and a 5th Circuit Court of Appeals
ruling.  These are binding in the 5th Circuit (Southeastern U.S.) While
they are not binding on other Federal courts, they are strong persuasive
precedent (especially the Court of Appeals decision).  Courts are a lot
like horses -- they all want to go where other courts have been before.
Furthermore, legal commentators have strongly favored this decision, and
the idea that shrink-wrap licenses are unenforceable is as accepted a
doctrine in the I.P. community as anything that the Supremes haven't
commented on can be. 

In addition, keep in mind that the Supreme Court in recent decisions 
(Bonito Boats v. Thundercraft, for example) has been extremely quick to 
preempt state laws which they see as preempted by Federal law.  They're 
picky about that.

The set of facts you hypothesize really don't enter in to it too much.  
The reason shrink-wrap agreements are unenforceable is that the *entire 
character* of the sale is that of a sale and not a license.  Some of the 
characteristics include:  1) products are sold to anyone 2) without any 
negotiation of terms 3) in exchange for cash.  I provide the cash, you 
hand over the package.   That's a sale.  You can't change a sale *after 
the fact* into a license, under the Uniform Commercial Code.  Just 
because you give me the option of inconveniencing myself does not make 
this "license agreement" enforceable because *there was never an agreement*.

Imagine that you pay for an automobile, in cash.  They deliver the car to
your home.  Taped across the steering wheel is a sign:  "THIS CAR IS FOR
LEASE ONLY.  THE MONEY YOU GAVE US EARLIER WAS JUST A DOWN PAYMENT.  IF
YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS LEASE, DO NOT BREAK THIS SEAL, BUT
RETURN THE CAR TO YOUR DEALER FOR A FULL REFUND." (followed by a page of
legalese).  That is unenforceable, because it is an attempt to change the
character of the contract from a sale to a lease; just like a shrink-wrap
license is an attempt to change the character of the contract from a sale
to a license. 

Now, returning to the software world.  Let's say the agreement was on the
*outside* of the box, with big red letters on the front saying "THIS
SOFTWARE IS NOT FOR SALE, BUT FOR LICENSE ONLY", and you had to sign a
document saying you agreed to this *before* you handed over the cash. 
*That* would be a license.  Although there is still a suggestion of
unconscionability since there is no opportunity to negotiate. 

Think about it.  There's no reason software companies *couldn't* do what 
I suggest in the above paragraph except that they know no one would buy 
their software, because people want to OWN software, not license it.  The 
issue isn't one of what hoops the company tries to make you jump through 
(don't rip open this package, you can send it back if you don't agree), 
but rather one of *when* the contract is formed.  The contract is formed at 
the moment you hand over the money and they hand you the box.  One party 
can't change that by themselves, after the fact.  
 
I hope this helps explain things.

Since you have not indicated that you have run the VOTP program and
read the documentation, I won't make any comment regarding what you think
the program can't do.
 
I will not post any more message in reply to anyone sending private
EMail message or posting articles in this newsgroup regarding the VOTP
program unless the message or article indicates that the writer has
run the program and read the documentation file.  I have been wasting
too much time responding to comments that would probably would not
have been made had the writers actually run the program.

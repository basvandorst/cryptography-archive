As we've seen in a recent case, if they can get you in a jurisdiction of
their choice, they can get you. Since the code was posted in Californa (as
well as elsewhere), if the poster is anywhere in the U.S. and RSADSI wants
to go for extradition, they have a shot since the offense appears to carry
jail time (based on Grady Ward's posting of the relevant California code).

The California code also criminalizes reposting if you can be presumed to
have known the program was obtained by "improper means". Thus they can try
to extradite others, even if the original mailer/poster is really outside
the U.S., rather than being inside and using a foreign remailer.

But as Grady has said, by far the more serious exposure here is from
violating the Federal ITAR, a big time Federal felony. (Big time in that it
carries heavy fines and jail time--let's not have a "should it?" discussion
to complicate this.)

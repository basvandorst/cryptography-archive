I am looking for suggestions on stream encryption
methods using a DES block-encryption function 
as the core component of the keystream generator.

Criteria are:

1. Security
2. Efficient in terms of amount of keystream generated per
   block-encryption operation

I can envision a number of simple configurations that
could be used, but would like suggestions on which configuration(s) 
would be desirable in practice.

Thanks,

Steve

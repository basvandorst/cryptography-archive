...originally due to A.L.Toom in Doklady, TOM 150.  The translation
from Russian is in "The Complexity of a Scheme of Functional Elements
Realizing the Multiplication of Integers", Soviet Mathematics-Doklady,
May-June 1963, Volume 4, Number 3, p. 714.

Mr. Zuras uses an improvement which I think is from Shmuel Winograd's
"Arithmetic complexity of computations" (1980), namely
evaluating/interpolating at small rational points instead of only
integers.

I took those results with a pinch of salt.

They certainly didn't.  The FFTs he uses have little to do with the
best known methods, viz Scho"nhage-Strassen and its variants (by
Arnold Scho"nhage in LNCS 144 or by Henri Nussbaumer, see Knuth
vol. 2).  He breaks the numbers into 4, 8 or 16 pieces whereas at that
size the best algorithms break them into thousands or tens of
thousands of pieces!

Yes.

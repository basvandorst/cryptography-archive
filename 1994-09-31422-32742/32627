   In August, I posted the below challenge.  It looks as if
   about 9 people have taken up the challenge, with one of
   them succeeding in discovering the algorithm.
   (That was chughes@maths.tcd.ie -- congrats!)

I made a start on it and spent a few hours.  There's some fascinating
structure in there.

   I have held off on posting the solution upon request.
   Now it's time for me to give a few hints, in preparation for
   spilling the beans in a few weeks.

   Here are a few hints on the algorithm:

   -- The check digit algorithm regards the input number
   as 10 independent numbers 0-9.  So, the input 0123456789
   is simply 10 small integers, not 0.123456789e9 or
   the ASCII values 0x30 0x31 0x32, etc.

I assumed that.

   -- The algorithm employs fairly sizeable lookup tables.

I didn't assume that, though it clearly is implementable in that
manner.  For instance, a trivial (!) implementation is as a 1e10 entry
table.  It would even fit on a single disk these days.

   -- Aside from index arithmetic, no mathematical operations
   are involved.  The algorithm involves table lookup exclusively.

I was analyzing it in terms of permutation matrices.  The fascinating
structure lies in the manner in which the matrices interlock.

   Do we have any more takers before I post Chuck Hughes solution?

I might work some more on it.  My vote is that you should wait another
2-4 weeks and then post the solution.

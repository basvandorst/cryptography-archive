The National Security Agency has become one of the 5-year-old Cray Computer
Corp.'s first paying customers. NSA recently signed a $9.2 million joint
development agreement with the struggling Colorado Springs, CO, supercomputer
maker to fund construction of a Cray3/Super-Scalable System. NSA officials
said they expect to have the machine installed within 15 months.
NSA chief scientist George Cotter called the agreement "an important initiative
of the High-Performance Computing and Communications program."
    [...]
The super-scalable machine will perform vector, parallel, and hybrid computing
tasks. Cray Computer will construct a hybrid system powered by a pair of
500-MHz Cray-3 processors plus 256,000 processor-in-memory chips.

I fixed the SKS.  It came with a scope and a Russian night scope.  It's
killer.  My friend knows about a  really good gunsmith who has a
machineshop and knows how to convert stuff to automatic.

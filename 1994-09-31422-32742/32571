What part of 'You don't know what you're talking about' don't YOU understand?
You say "If that's where...a copyright violation," but that's NOT TRUE. In
fact, it's false, and very misleading. US copyright law preserves the right
of the individual to copy copyrighted documents and portions of copyrighted
documents in certain, very easy to fit into, situations. If that's where the
exposure came from, while it is highly probable that the discloser(s) would
be found to have violated trade secret rights, it is NOT true that "there has
been [sic] at a minimum a copyright violation."

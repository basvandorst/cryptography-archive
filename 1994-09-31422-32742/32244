	Without some innovative enhancement to what company A developed,
company B has no patentable invention, even assuming B legitimately acquired
knowledge of what A developed and was trying to maintain as a trade secret.
It is possible, if B applied for the patent without informing the PTO
examiner of A's contribution, either as co-inventor or as prior art
(depending on the circumstances), for the PTO to then grant a patent to B.
However, B's patent is then vulnerable to attack for invalidity based on
the nondisclosure to the PTO.

	In any case, B cannot legitimately patent an invention for A's
inventive work, at least absent B's own inventive contribution of some
enhancement or at least legitimate coinventive role, and in neither case
can B safely proceed with a patent application without disclosing A's
contribution to the PTO in the course of the patent examination before
a patent is issued.

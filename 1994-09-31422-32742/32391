      The "first-sale doctrine" comes into play here.  When you buy
something, in general you get the right to use it in any way you see fit,
subject to any statutory restrictions.  This is why, for
example, movie companies can't enforce a provision against video rental
stores, despite statements on the tape.  That one was thoroughly litigated
a decade ago.  And that's why shrink-wrap licences don't really do much
other than protect rights already protected by copyright law.

      The SPA did get a specific prohibition against third-party software
rental enacted into law a few years back, but that's narrowly drawn.

      This stuff has been litigated.  Look up the case law if you're
interested.

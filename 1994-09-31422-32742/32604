Sternlight is confused as usual. The point of a clean room is to clone
a competitor's product without infringing on its copyright. If you're
at this stage, you've already broken any trade secrets in the product.

Another flaw in his argument, as several people have pointed out, is
that it's not clear RC4 meets the law's definition of ``trade secret.''

Finally, Sternlight's ``could be presumed to know'' standard is a
figment of his imagination.

Further discussion in talk.politics.crypto.

Note the lack of the words "legally binding" or "valid" in this sentence.

I could put a "non-disclosure" agreement on a Dole banana.  I doubt,
however, that it would have any legal weight if I attempted to prevent
someone from peeling said banana.

I will note that the Lotus Notes box nearest my seat says "INSTALLATION
AND USE OF THIS SOFTWARE IS SUBJECT TO THE SOFTWARE AGREEMENT [etc etc
etc]".  Reverse engineering does not require installation, nor is it use.

Said agreement claims, probably erroneously, that only one archival copy
of the Software may be made, and that it may not be loaned, rented,
leased, or licensed (attempting to remove rights granted by copyright).
It also, of course, claims to prohibit disassembling or decompiling.

It does not have any reference to non-disclosure.

Has Lotus Notes ever been sold in Louisiana?  I vaguely recall that for
legal reasons having to do with the different common law base (Code
Napoleon) that shrink-wrap agreements had been held invalid there.  I
could be wrong, of course; I'm not a lawyer (thankfully).

If so, the reverse-engineering of a copy purchased in Louisiana would be
perfectly legal.

No Sir! Other than in your Imagination, real Life (and Math, too, in these
Days) knows a third Value besides "true" and "false" which is called
"unknown". If Mr. Bidzos makes Assertions which are perfectly in his own
Interest, we can safely deny taking that as a Proof for "true" *without*
being restricted to call it "false" (i.e., he lied).

Fortunately, most legal Systems in democratic Countries do *not* assume
that He Who Knows may effectively decide the Matter. If I were accused
of releasing confidential Material derived from propietary Software in
Germany, I would first be asked where I obtained the Software; Then I
can either say that I didn't use the Software to get at the Material in
Question or tell them where I got it. In the first Case, the Guy suing
me would have to make reasonably clear that I can't have obtained the
released Material without the Software; In the second, it's *his* Job
to provide Proofs that the Copy I got and the Proceedings how I got it
imply the Restrictions he's claiming on me.

Granted, a Software Salesman showing around how the S/W gets sold at this
Moment (with a big "BREAK THIS SEAL AND WE TELL YOU WHAT YOU'RE ALLOWED
TO DO" on it) and claiming that it's been always this Way is likely to
impress the Court in such a Situation; However, if I can then come up
with the Remainders of the Package I bought and they look quite different,
eventually with different License Agreements on the Back, he's going to
lose a Lot of his Credibility. And, in Contrast to you, Mr. Sternlight,
no Judge would be bewildered by the Fact that someone has claimed Rights
he hasn't got. Judges see this Kind of Thing sometimes, you know.

*Disclaimer* I don't know the Software in Question, not to mention the
License Terms for it. I'm only objecting to the Point of View "If the
Salesman says you go to Jail, you'll do".

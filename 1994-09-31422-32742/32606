What are you talking about David?  In my original statement I said the
deposit requirements keep getting weakened in a vain attempt to forstall
the inevitable shouts that the Berne Convention "eliminated" the deposit
requirements.  Obviously I failed in that regard (triple sigh). So I tried
to make myself clearer.  You call this "changing the subject."

My point was, and remains, you can't use copyright and trade secret law
to "protect" (i.e. bring action in a U.S. court) the same thing at the
same time.  You have to choose between copyright and trade secret.  If
you choose to bring action for copyright infringment, you must register
(with some Berne Convention exceptions) the work with the U.S. Copyright
Office which inherently requires disclosure.

I acknowledge your expertise in this area.

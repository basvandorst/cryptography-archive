Hmmm... I thought I was reading his comments with a reasonable mind.  I've
just come across Mr. Sternlight this week, in fact...

Because there's a perfectly logical third alternative, and his language
seemed calculated to exclude it: someone encrypted a bunch of cleartext,
and gave the input, output, and keys to a third party not bound by
anyone's license agreement with RSADSI.

I wasn't flaming him for that.  I was flaming him for doing his best to
demonstrate _every_ form of fallactious argument in my Logic text.

Or they're a thief, in which case the license _still_ doesn't apply.

No, Clive.. this _doesn't_ follow.  See above.

I was going to respond with "bullshit".  And then I saw who the poster
was.  :-)

As I noted above... no.  He was asserting that people not party to a
contract with RSADSI were subject to a clause of such a contract which was
more restrictive than an explicit clause in California law.  I was simply
refuting him.  How does this demontrate fallacious thinking, pray?

   I know that the mail public key scheme is RSA (I can RTFM with the best of 
   them), but how big is the key (I hear rumours that it is quite small, only 
   around 50 to 60 bits)? I assume that it does not RSA encrypt the whole message 
   directly, this would be too slow. What is its primary encryption scheme?

I know that Lotus notes has 2 BSAFE keys.  One is 512 bits, the other is
384.  I don't know how they are used.  (You can tell this by looking
at your keyring, and you will notice that there are two keys on there!)

Unfortunately I don't know much more than this.

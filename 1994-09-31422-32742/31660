This concept sounds rather like a code to me, where the codebook is 
the model.  I realize that in the details, you do not have a large
lookup table, but if you treat the system as a black box, it looks
like a code.

If I've missed something fundamentally different here, I apologise.
I've just finished a 3-day weekend, and I'm having difficulty 
restarting my brain.

That's right.

Nope.

OK, here I am.	I'm not your lawyer, of course, but this is my general
understanding of trade secret law.  Standard disclaimers: Don't rely on me
for legal advice, get your own damn lawyer, etc. etc.

Let us assume for the sake of argument that an enforceable secrecy
agreement has been violated.  As I observed earlier, shrink wrap licenses
are generally unenforceable, and are *certainly* unenforceable as regards
trade secret.  Arguably, the mere act of selling a product to someone
*without* a negotiated, signed trade secret agreement destroys any trade
secret you might have had, since you are not taking adequate security
measures to protect yourself.

So let's assume an enforceable agreement violated by a person, "A".  What
are Company "C's" options?

1) Company C can sue A for damages.
2) Company C can sue employer B who wrongfully and knowingly enticed A to
violate his trade secret agreement with C.
3) Company C can *not* sue (well, they can, but they won't win) company D
who used the formerly secret information innocently, because the state
trade secret law is preempted by the Federal Copyright Act (see, e.g.,
Computer Associates v. Altai.

The Copyright Act *guarantees* citizens the right to copy unpatented
ideas.  State trade secret law can hold people liable for their
intentional or knowing breach of confidences, but cannot modify their
right to copy (in fact, that's the proper way to look at trade secret law:
as enforcing an *agreement of confidentiality between two parties as to
certain materials*, rather than as protecting "Intellectual Property"
rights in some object.

I have placed the source code of a very simple encryption/decryption 
filter in my ftp directory, and I am requesting that those interested 
take a look at it and perhaps provide suggestions and criticisms of the 
algorithm.  It is intended for rather simple applications rather than 
full-fledged secure systems, but I still need to know the level of its 
strength (or its lack thereof).

The source, along with an MS-DOS executable and SunOS binary, may be 
found at ftp.netcom.com, in /pub/pparks/Encryption.

Thank you for your time,
Paul M. Parks

I thought it took a lot longer than that.  I remember seeing postings
about the RSA-129 factoring effort for a much longer time than just
one month.

Ah, but 'bigger keys' are actually a good enough answer.  Increases in

On the contrary.  If you don't publish your method, then nobody smart
will trust it, because then they can't tell how good it is.

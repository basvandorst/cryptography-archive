Has anyone got any information on the VideoCrypt system used by Sky which is 
used here in New Zealand and also I guess in europe. I've heard of some 
software that was supposedly written by someone in Germany for emulating the 
smart card and goes by the filename ?? Ohmygod.zip or something like that.

Thank you.

You probably did; I think that it was in the telecom group.

The articles were first person stories from a few people who had
some reason to talk to a European PTT about their cards, and were
shown a list of the numbers called on those cards.

I also believe the reports that in the US, all local called
numbers are recorded and stored for awhile.  On of those stories
was that all these records were subpoena-ed in a large city
(Cincinatti, I think) to try to trace the source of a leaked
story.

I have no way to know whether these stories are true.  However it
is certainly technically quite inexpensive to write a 40 byte log
record with each call giving time, called #, calling #, card #.

Disbelieve if you wish.  Also feel free to disbelieve stories that
in certain public places, such as Victoria Station, London, video
cameras are aimed 1) around the station in general, and 2)
specifically at the pay phones.  Also disbelieve the stories that
Air France bugs firstclass seats.  etc. etc. This certainly makes
you feel much more secure.

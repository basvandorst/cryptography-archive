Well I have Hasted's article right here.  I agree that PGP
should resist his *easy* chinese-remainder attack because even
when you encrypt to multiple recipients PGP pads the session key
with different random bits to make up each RSA "message."  (Or I
*think* it does something like this--but I'd need to look at the
source again to be sure.)  But I am not so sure it would resist
his more exotic attack if you encrypted to a large number of
recipients in the same "cryptogram."  At least in the example he
gives (adding a timestamp) he seems to be suggesting that even
such padded "messages" might fall over to the attack with all
the bells and whistles.  Just to make sure, if I need to send a
message to a whole BUNCH of people, I intend to do it in batches
with < 7 recipients per cryptogram, and gen an entirely new RSA
"message" for each such batch...

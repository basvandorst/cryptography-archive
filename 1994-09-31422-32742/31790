Now hang about.  This does not sound like a OTP at all.  It
sounds like it (must be) a PRNG--essentially by XORing it is a
crude stream cypher.

This is the bit:

"the program re-creates the virtual OTP when decrypting a  file."

Then the program and the starting conditions for it are the REAL
"key" and not the output of it.  Anyone with those two things
can generate the "pad" and decrypt the message.  Since you have
made the program freely available, the real "key" is reduced to
the starting conditions for the program.  I presume some kind of
password or passphrase.

In the end, that's what you keep secret and both parties must
have.  A LOT weaker than any real OTP, looks like to me.

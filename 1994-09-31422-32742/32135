I've written a version of the code that uses the same algorithm but none 
of the original source code.  The RSADSI post claimed that the trade 
secret they claimed was the source code.  At this point, calling RC-4 a 
trade secret seems to me to require a lot of stretching of the 
imagination, anyway.

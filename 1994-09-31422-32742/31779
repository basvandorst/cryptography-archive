The original Vernam system used Baudot character codes, these character
codes might (or might not) have been in random order.  Mauborgne's one-
time-pad concept added the requirement that the pairs of key tapes would
never be reused.  The concept of a PRNG did not appear until the age of
programable electronic computers.
 
Since your ability to solve cryptograms is not relevant to the Virtual
One-Time-Pad program that you obviously have not seen, I have no
further comments regarding the "by-god" given pronouncements in your
message.

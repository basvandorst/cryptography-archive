One objection I have is that the traffic on the net is NOT truly random.
Most traffic is in english, so the characters comprising the traffic 
will exhibit (over a VERY LARGE sample size) frequencies similar to that
of english.  I believe I have heard it said that english texts XORed
together can be broken.  I think I could buy into that statement.

Based on the above objection, you might get away with sampling a single
bit from each byte.  I suspect that if you did some statistical analysis
on english, you might find that the nth bit of each character was rather
more random than just using the character itself.

This objection may disappear as the net becomes more universal and
multi-lingual.

Of course, I won't raise the issue of transmitting/storing the keys
of OTPs.

You can "black out" portions of the code that contain trade secrets,
but under Title 37 C.F.R., Chapter II, Part 202.20(c)(vii)(B) "Where
registration of a program containing trade secrets is made on the basis
of an object code deposit the Copyright Office will make registration
under its rule doubt and warn that no determination has been made
concerning the existence of copyrightable authorship."

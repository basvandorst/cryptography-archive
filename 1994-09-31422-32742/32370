I don't think so. Most agreements I have seen indicate that unilateral
changes by the issuer are deemed to be accepted by the cardholder, who has
the right to return the card if he doesn't accept those changes. This
exactly parallels the text on disk envelopes in software, which says 'don't
open the envelope if you don't agree to the license terms, but return the
product for a refund'.

I think what you are misremembering is the original credit card agreement.
This is also like the disk envelope agreement. You often don't see the full
agreement until they send the card. That one is the one that says that if
you don't like it, return the card. If you use the card you have agreed to
the agreement.

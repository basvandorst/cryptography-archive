I remember reading that the estimate for factoring rsa 129 was about
40 quadrillion (sp?) (40 * 10^15 ?) years.
Does someone have the 1977 Sci.Am issue at hand to see on on which 
algorithm and computer that estimate was based ?
The improvement in hardware speed isn't that big.If I remember correctly,
the Cray 1 had just arrived around that time,and is still faster than (m)any 
workstations.I don't have it's MIPS rating at hand however.
I think that Rivest,Shamir and Adleman knew very well what the state-of-the art 
algorithms and hardware were,and I hate to think that their guess was off
by a factor of about 10^16.

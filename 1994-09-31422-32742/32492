Sorry I can't resist. I have writen a paper on the problems of quantum
factoring, as has Rolf Landauer. I it a LOT more difficult than you
think. And "averaging" does not help as far as I can see. The key
problem is that the interfering is incredibly sensitive to outside
perturbations. It takes very very little to upset the interference and
give garbage out. Furthermore the effect goes at least exponentially (in
the square of the length) in
the length of the number to be factored.
So unless there is some weird breakthrough, 5 years is rather
optimistic shall we say.

My paper is available on the hepth preprint repository at Los Alamos, or
you could email me for the Tex text (using RevTex3.0)

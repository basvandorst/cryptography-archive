In MAPLE, there is a probabilistic prime number test (function  prime  or
isprime ) which is used for large numbers. The algorithm was found by
some Mr. Strassen (or Mr. Staerk?). If the test is done once, you can
get the answers:

- no, the number surely isn't prime
 or
- yes, the number is prime with probability > 3/4 .

To get a better probability, repeat the test some times (in MAPLE, it is
repeated 5 times by default).

I have the algorithm at home and can't get it just now. If you want it,
please e-mail me, because I'm not reading this group regularly. And
perhaps you have to ask for the copyrights...

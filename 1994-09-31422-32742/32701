Vast farrago of verbiage trying to prove one point, usually a sure sign that
Rubin seems to me to be blowing smoke, omitted.

It's simple, Paul. When the law says: "and a trade secret shall be presumed
to be secret when", then what follows is the definition, and it supersedes
any ambiguities created by the preceding material. In this case, what
follows is "the owner thereof takes measures to prevent it from becoming
available to persons other than those selected"

Thus the law presumes it to be secret even if someone improperly betrayed
it in the New York Times. Thus all penalties for betraying the "secret"
apply, despite the unauthorized publication.

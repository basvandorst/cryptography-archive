I did say that, somewhere... but I think my news server ate the posting.

Actually, someone else suggested this while I was waiting to see my
version of it come up.  I don't recall who.  We do agree it's practical,
though, right?

Ok... stipulated.  Hadn't thought about that possibility.

That wasn't what I meant.  What I meant was that it didn't follow that
_the licensee_, one covered by the restrictive license, was necessarily
the reverse engineer.  David said that Californians "better watch out",
implying that a contract they aren't party to could bind them more tightly
than state law.

No, not personally.  I guess 'where' is appropriate.  I've seen quite a
bit of your news, and done quite a bit of business with SCO.

Ok... he might have meant that.  But it's not necessary that someone
subject to a contract had to breach it for some independent third party to
reverse engineer the code.  It's possible that the contract simply wasn't
strong enough.  Or, it's possible, as noted, that someone created a batch
of ciphertext, and the ciphertext, plaintext and key found their way to a
R.E.

If the license prohibits _that_ (releasing your key in conjunction with a
batch of such texts), then I submit that the license is unenforceable,
since it might make the product impossible to use.

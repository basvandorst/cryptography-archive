   If David was a little more cryptographically astute he would notice
that:

   1) The information provided in the message is sufficient to
indicate that the poster could commit phone fraud.  (But the
cost/benefit ratio, even assuming zero risk of prosecution, is wrong.
It's like spending $100 to be able to recharge your electric razor
from your car battery instead of household current.  You can do it.
If you spend a lot of time camping deep in the woods, it might even be
worth doing.  But not as a means of saving money.)

   2) Cracking the additional security code wouldn't significantly
help in fraud.  It would just mean you could recharge cards that you
hadn't looked at while charged.  (But it might be interesting.)

   3) The information posted is insufficient for the purpose of
cracking the code.  In particular you would need readouts from cards
with other than 70 units...

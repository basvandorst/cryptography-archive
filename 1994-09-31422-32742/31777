:       Sure they have.  That's a 3-tape Vernam cypher.  2-tape
: Vernam systems, with real paper tape loops, were used prior to WWII.

The two tape version was invented by Vernam himself and described in

  Vernam, Gilbert S., "Cipher Printing Telegraph Systems for
  Secret Wire and Radio Telegraphic Communication," _Journal
  of the AIEE_, 45 pp109-115, February 1926.

(I have not actually read it)

:       However, even with relatively prime key lengths, there's a technique

:       If somebody has a program for cracking 2-tape Vernam, it could
: probably be adapted to crack this thing without much trouble.

I don't know who first broke it, but the attack is shown in: 

  Carl H. Meyer and Stephen M. Matyas, _Cryptography: A New Dimension in
  Computer Data Security_, John Wiley & Sons 1982, pp118-121.

As John noted, the attack extends easily to 3 or more tapes.

Okay...if I have read all of this correctly, then this Bidzos guy is saying 
that the only way the RC4 algorithm could have obtained is:
	a) theft from RSA
	b) reverse engineering a piece of software that uses it, such as Lotus Notes.

I can see how a is wrong, and there is great dispute as to whether or not b is 
legally binding.

But couldn't the algorithm have also been deduced via
	c) taking the original text, encrypted text, and password and working back 
		from that?

Or is RSA now claiming ownership of everything encrypted by RC4 also?

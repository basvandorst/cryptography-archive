The X/Open Security Working Group (SWG) is working to develop and/or 
adopt standard cryptographic APIs.  The SWG is primarily focused on 
developing an algorithm-independent interface to cryptographic and key 
management services which is suitable for use by application programmers, 
not just cryptographers.  This doesn't preclude standardised interfaces 
to individual algorithms (DES, RSA, DSA, Skipjack etc) but these are 
not as high a priority, nor an adequate substitute for an algorithm-
independent application-level programming interface.

The SWG would like to review and take advantage of existing work in this 
area and therefor solicits applicable documents and specifications from 
the industry.

To participate, please send email to the SWG list (xotgsafe@xopen.co.uk) 
or to the SWG chair, Piers McMahon (p.mcmahon@xopen.co.uk).

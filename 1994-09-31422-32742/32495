I just read this paper this morning.  It is available for ftp according
to the author but I neglected to save the site before printing out
and deleting the mail.  Perhaps someone can post the location.

The description above is not quite right.  Instead, the approach
is to take a number x less than the n we want to factor, and to use
the quantum computer to find the least k such that x to the kth power
mod n is equal to 1.  Being able to do this implies the ability to
factor n.

What the machine does is to simultaneously take x to all powers less
than n; that is, it puts itself into a superposition of states holding
x to the i mod n for all i less than n.  From this it undergoes a
special transformation which will cause those states for which x to the
i is not 1 to destructively interfere.  This part of the paper is complex
and I don't understand it yet.  But the net result is that with sig-
nificant likelihood we find the k we wanted which lets us factor n.

Yes, at least five years away, in somewhat the same sense that turning
the solar system into a ringworld is at least five years away.

It's not bizarre, it's the law. Basically, publishing a trade secret damages
the owner of the secret. What is generous is giving innocent publishers of
such secrets a ticket-of-leave for damaging the owner, not penalizing those
who know they are publishing the secret.

Never, just as a trade secret successfully protected never runs out.
Recall that the holder of a trade secret has no protection against
independent invention. The patent holder is protected by the government
against that, and in exchange has a time limit.

Classified information laws have nothing to do with patents, trademarks, or
copyrights.

Your logic is flawed. Classified information is not private property. Trade
secrets are.

That is a non-sequitur. Just ask Aldrich Ames. If still in doubt, check with
an attorney.

I counted something like 20 posts out of 76 that were not legal/personal
wrangling.  Pretty poor signal-to-noise.

I understand sci.crypt.research (moderated) will be created soon, and
that will certainly help.  However, there are probably plenty of crypto
issues that won't be in it's charter, and this will be the place to hear
and speak about them.

It may be valuable to learn about some of the maneuverings and injuries
(perceived or real) on the commercial side, but the resultant quibbling is 
getting to be too much.  Posting of press releases (by the principals) is 
fine, as well as pointers to further discussion forums, but please take 
the ad nauseum back-and-forth somewhere else.

If this doesn't work, maybe we could just publicly announce the names and 
reasons whenever we put someone in our kill file for such conduct?  It'll make 
for a little extra noise, but should have a dampening effect overall.

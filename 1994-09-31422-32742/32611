Well, yes and no.

In the narrowest technical sense, there are no rules for changing the 
charter of a Big 7 group.  Technically, even a 'renaming' of a group
occurs by creating the group under a new name and eventually destroying
the old one.  

That's not to say whether or not the news.announce.newgroups moderator,
David Lawrence, would accept an RFD/CFV for changing a group's
charter using the standard Big 7 rules.  He might; he might not.
It's been a long time since I've played in news.groups, so I'm not
sure if there's any recent precedent.

So most likely you will find lots of people who will say you
have to do the RFD/CFV by the numbers, and lots of other people who
will say it's unnecessary.

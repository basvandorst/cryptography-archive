I agree if the words "by methods that are known and in the public domain"
are added.

This assumes factoring is the only possible method. Can anyone prove that
it is the only possible method? 
If factoring is essential could an alternative viable method combine
factoring with other techniques, e.g. statistical methods to reduce the
sheer volume of number crunching?

It is not the security of my messages that concerns me.

Again accepted subject to my earlier proviso.

Sure but is there any mathematical proof that a loophole does not exist? I 
expect the answer to be no.

Again you assume that factoring provides the only possible solution. Why?

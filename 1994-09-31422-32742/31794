	Could someone briefly explain the differences between Secure Drive
	and Secure File System? As I understand it, they both encrypt hard
	drive partitions, but I'd like to know about which algos. they
	use, relative strengths and weaknesses, etc. Also, please comment
	on ease-of-use, installation, and personal preferences, etc.
	Thanks much.

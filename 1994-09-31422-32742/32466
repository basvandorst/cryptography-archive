Which brings up the interesting question...why did RSADSI choose to go
the trade-secret route with RC2 and RC4?  There are a couple of god
reasons why someone might want to keep something a trade secret rather
than patent it:

	1.  They want protection longer than 17 years. 

	2.  They want to prevent others from engineering around the patent.

Neither makes sense in this case.  Cryptography is moving fast enough that
17 years of protection is more than good enough for a secret-key algorithm.
And cryptography is archaic enough that if someone came out with an RC4
variant it woundn't do nearly as well in the marketplace.

RSADSI had to have known that this would happen eventually.  I had always
envisioned a small box mounted on the wall in Jim Bidzos' office with a
document inside and the words stenciled on the outside: "In case of
releaseof RC2 or RC4, break glass."  Their reaction has me really confused.

Either RSADSI made a major mistake in judgment, or I am missing something.
Or they have a submarine patent on the algorithms.

A book on Operation MAGIC (pre-Pearl Harbor cracking of the Japanese Diplomatic 
Cipher) [I forget which one] reports that Naval Intelligence was not allowed to 
know that State had cracked the cipher, even though the Japanese Navy used the 
same machine for its highest security cipher.  However, Naval Intelligence had
learned that one of the diplomatic machines was in the Japanese Consulate in
Chicago and the only night security was that the consul slept in the office.

They used the oldest technique in the book to insure that the consul spent the
night elsewhere, entered the consulate, cracked the safe, disassembled and
photographed the machine, and restored everything without a trace (at least,
without any that the consul noticed).

Lots of people use the same password, or variants of one password, for
multiple systems.  If you want to find someone's password for a secure
system, you might want to look for a WordPerfect or now PKZip password
for a clue.

While I'm posting to this thread: Good job Paul!  PKZIP encryption
has been around a long time with people conjecturing that its not
all that secure without any actual proof.

      That may be a hoax.  RSA has E-mail of their own, and could post
if they so desired.  

      If they wanted protection on the algorithm, they should have patented 
it, as they did with RSA itself.  Trade secret law doesn't protect against
reverse engineering.  As a matter of public policy, trade secret law is
weak, to encourage patents.  Patents have a limited life (17 years) and
you have to disclose how it works.  This encourages innovation without
providing a permanent monopoly.

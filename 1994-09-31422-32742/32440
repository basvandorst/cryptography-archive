Back issues of Scientific American?  The RSA method has not been 
"broken" if that is what you are looking for.  A large 
cooperative managed by a long sustained effort to factor just one 
129 digit (about 430 bit) key in a public key system similar to 
PGP.  What they did was demonstrate that a single key of that 
size could be broken if enough effort was expended.  There are 
any number of other possible keys, none of which has been 
compromised by the one which has been factored.  Most PGP users 
use 1024 bit keys, which are many, many times more difficult to 
factor than a 430 bit one.

Yes, if you use the larger 1024 bit key size.

(Tee hee)  Er, no, I haven't.

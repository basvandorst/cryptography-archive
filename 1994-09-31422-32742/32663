    I have studied parts of the Impagliazzo-Naor paper.  I THINK their main
result is a pseudo-random number generator (which can be used for one-time
pads) with the property that IF there is a way of distinguishing its out-
put from genuine random output THEN there is a polynomial time algorithm
which will correctly solve ``many'' subset-sum problems.

    If I am correct about this, they are assuming that subset-sum is
intractable on average, which is a stronger assumption than that subset-
sum is intractable in worst case.

   Papadimitriou's recent book on COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY has some
discussion of encryption.  I think he was saying that there is no hope
of a provably hard encryption system, but I did not understand his
discussion and am probably oversimplifying.

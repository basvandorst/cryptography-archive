Summary: Request for Ideas for Worthwhile Coding Projects

	I am looking for ideas of interesting things to code. I don't have much
spare time (3 exams next week!) but I do manage to get quite a bit of coding
done on the side regardless. I had a few ideas and later ruled them out.
	Secure (cryptographically protected) conferencing (a la the coffee
house haven). Realtime, moderate security, two-ended authentication, etc.
Way impractical. (Or is it?)
	NFS factoring scheme. Code already available, can't run it anywhere
if I actually code it up. Well I could, but my account would vanish in no time.
Probably within a minute or two of the load spike.
	Fully automated cracking schemes. I've already completed a few of these
for weaker ciphers and feel ready to move onto something more interesting.
	Well, like I said, any better ideas? I'll post the finished code,
though I won't guarantee that it will be done especially quickly (I have other
things to do!). Thanks for the help.

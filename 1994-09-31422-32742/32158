 DS> WARNING NOTICE

A couple of questions occur to me.  How come a message this
seemingly important isn't signed in any way by *either* Bidzos
or Sternlight?   They don't like PGP, but purport to like RIPEM,
and *surely* RSARDI has some knowledge about authentication
issues.  How come Bidzos can't speak for himself?  Why is
Sternlight the nominated spokesman?

Why should anyone believe this is an official announcement of
anything by anyone?  Anyone could have made this up.  There have
been worse forgeries.

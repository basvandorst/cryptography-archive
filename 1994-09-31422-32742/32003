The interesting question is whether or not the code can be freely
distributed, copied, and used now that it is public.  Certainly RSADSI
can rightly claim that it is a trade secret.  They have never made the
code (or the design) public, and havea required anyone who sees the code
to sign a non-disclosure agreement.  Presumably any product that uses the
code has a shrink-wrap agreement that includes provisions against
reverse-engineering.

But now the code is public.  It was first posted on cypherpunks; it was
crossposted to sci.crypt.  It is available on Mark Riordan's ftp site, and
probably many others.  Does RSADSI have any legal recourse against people
who use and distribute the cipher who have not signed any agreement not to?

Certainly this sort of thing happens in the press all the time.  Someone
leaks some information, and the next day it is in the headlines.  Does it
make any difference that it is source code?  Does it matter if the code was
a) written from a description of the algorithm by someone who signed a
non-disclosure, b) copied and trivially changed by someone who had a licensed
copy of the source code, or c) reverse-engineered from a product?  Does
the Stac vs Microsoft ruling have any bearing on this matter?

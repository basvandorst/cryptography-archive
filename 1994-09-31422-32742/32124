I was wondering how difficult it would be to take an algorythm such as
RSA and have it work on streamed data rather than an existing file.  I'm
thinking of writing a public/private key encryption system for Windows
and NT that would take care of encryption at the comm port driver level
so that all communications across the port would be secure.

suggestions/flames/warnings welcome

thanks,

Pat

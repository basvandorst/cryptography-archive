I don't see how this is a parallel. A credit card is a financial instrument
that allows you to (a) spend money from an account and (b) borrow money.

The agreement covers your use of the card and the terms by which credit
is extended. The card remains the property of the bank. You never 'buy'
the card. It's not as if you walked into a bank, handed over some dosh,
and got a sealed package with credit card and agreement.

Anyway, in the UK at least one always has to sign a *full* agreement
when applying for a card. This allows the card company to vary the terms
as a result of this agreement. 

On the RC4 subject, a more interesting question is: Assuming that RC4
was disassembled/extracted/reverse engineered by someone who wasn't bound
by a license agreement, do RSA have any sanction against users of the
RC4 algorithm?

That's not really true, David. Copyright does NOT protect AT ALL the content
[idea] of a document, only the form/presentation of it. There also happen
to be a number of instances in which it is 100% legal to copy a document
and/or a 'reasonable' portion of it.

So, while it is POSSIBLE that the disclosure violated copyright, it is not
a given.

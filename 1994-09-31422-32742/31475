I don't know that anyone has built a CD ROM one-time-pad (OTP) device,
though it has been discussed here before.

My opinion was (and still is) that CD ROM is a terrible medium for the
OTP key stream.  First, you want exactly two copies of the random
stream.  CD ROM has an economic advantage only for large runs.
Second, you want to destroy the part of the stream already used.  CD
ROM has no erase facilities, outside of physical destruction of the
entire disk.

Does your device overcome these objections ?

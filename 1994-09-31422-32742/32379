1) Federal law, and the law of all 50 states, requires the essential
disclosure of the central information for getting a credit card *before*
you get it.  For example, you can't order a card without knowing what the
interest rate is.

A shrink-wrap license, on the other hand, is an attempt to change the
fundamental nature of the transaction from the purchasing of an object to
the leasing of intellectual property.  This is not allowed under the
Uniform Commercial Code.

2) Credit cards are a service.  Computer software is a good.

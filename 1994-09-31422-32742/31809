I have spent half a day trying to find material for a
comprehensive introductory article on the future of Internet
billing.  I guess this means network transactions done with the
so called "digital money" or "digital cash" and based on public
cryptography systems and digital signatures. 

In the indispensable "W3 Catalog" I found several resources:

- The WWW page of the Chaum company DigiCash, but it only touts
  it's own products.  
- The FAQ of this group but it is rather vague on 
  the subject.
- The Cyberpunks Gopher, but it's material on this 
  subject is very unstructured and confusing

I notify you of these resources and I hope you could point me to
some others.  I have yet to "nngrab" our big disk NNTP server.

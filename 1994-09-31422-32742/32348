This doesn't make sense.  Let me analyze:

1) Property is not capable of violating trade secret agreements.  People
violate trade secret agreements.  The only people who are bound by trade
secret agreements are those who have entered in to them; they are
essentially contracts.
2) "Contraband" is forbidden or illegal material.  An exposed trade secret
is not contraband.
3) None of this has anything at all to do with the laws of export, as I
understand it (although there might be export restrictions on the items in
question for other reasons, the mere fact that it once was but is no
longer a trade secret shouldn't enter in to this.)

As I am not an export in import/export laws, I leave the remainder of your
post to some other lawyer.

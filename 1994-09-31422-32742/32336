	   I came across some code recently that used:

   (input)^3 mod (constant)        as the decryption algorithm.

   Does anyone have any information as to the strength
   of this - what the encryption routine is - whether
   the constant is prime, product of primes, ... ????
   Basically, any information I can get would be
   appreciated.

Looks very much like RSA with private exponent equal to 3.  If I'm right,
the constant should be the product of two large primes.

Alternatively, rather than decryption, it might be signature checking
-- which is a special case of decryption I confess.  "3" is not a very
good choice for a private exponent, but a reasonable one for a public
exponent.

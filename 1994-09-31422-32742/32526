As usual, I disagree. I think that if an agreement purports to bind you,
then you must be able to see _all_ the terms of that agreement before
making the purchase.  Simple notice that you will be bound by such an
agreement is very likely insufficient.

UCC, David... UCC.   Produce the contract I signed.

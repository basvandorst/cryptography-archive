Paradoxes of Probability

A treatise on probability theory wouldn't be complete without a number
of paradoxes to thoroughly confuse you.  Here are a few classic ones:


THE MONTY HALL 3 DOOR PROBLEM

Monty Hall presents his game show contestant with three doors numbered
1, 2, and 3.  Behind one of the doors is the grand prize.  The
contestant chooses a door.  Then Monty, who knows what's behind each
door, opens up one of the two remaining doors which doesn't have the
grand prize behind it.  Monty asks the contestant, "Do you want to stay
with your original choice or would you like to switch to the other
remaining door?"

Should the contestant stay with her original choice, should she change
to the other door, or does it not make any difference?


                           SIMPSON'S PARADOX

     A doctor has two drugs, A and B, which he can prescribe to patients
with a certain illness.  The drugs have been rated in terms of their
effectiveness on a scale of 1 to 6, with 1 being the least effective and
6 being the most effective.  Studies show that drug A is uniformly
effective at a value of 3.  Drug B varies in its effectiveness.  54% of
the time it scores a value of 1, and 46% of the time it scores a value
of 5.

             | |                     54% |-|
             | |                         | |         46% |-|
             | |                         | |             | |
             | |                         | |             | |
     -----------------------             -----------------------
      1   2   3   4   5   6               1   2   3   4   5   6
             Drug A                              Drug B


     The doctor, wishing to provide his patients with the best possible
care, asks his statistician friend which drug has the highest
probability of being the most effective.  The statistician says, "It is
clear that drug A is the most effective drug 54% of the time.  Thus drug
A is your best bet."

     Later a new drug C becomes available.  Studies show that on the
scale of 1 to 6, 22% of the time this drug scores a 6, 22% of the time
it scores a 4, and 56% of the time it scores a 2.


     56% |-|
         | |
         | | 22% |-| 22% |-|
         | |     | |     | |
     -----------------------
      1   2   3   4   5   6
             Drug C


     The doctor, again wishing to provide his patients with the best
possible care, goes back to his statistician friend and asks him which
drug has the highest probability of being the most effective.  The
statistician says, "Well, seeing as there's this new drug C on the
market, your best bet is now drug B, and drug A is your worst bet."

Show that the statician is right.



                          THE THREE-CARD GAME
                   (The problem of the three chests)

Three cards are in a hat.  One card is white on both sides; the second
is white on one side and red on the other; the third is red on both
sides.  The dealer shuffles the cards, takes one out and places it flat
on the table.  The side showing is red.  The dealer now says,
"Obviously this is not the white-white card.  It must be either the
red-white card or the red-red card.  I will bet even money that the
other side is red."  Is this a fair bet?




THE CHILD PARADOX

Question 1:

     A mother has two children.  The older one is a daughter named Mary.
     What is the probability that the other child is a boy?


Question 2:

    A mother has two children.  One of them is a daughter.  What is the
    probability that the other child is a boy?


Question 3:

    A mother has two children.  One of them is a daughter named Mary.
    What is the probability that the other child is a boy?

ANSWERS:

The Monty Hall 3 door problem:

The contestant should always switch doors.  Without switching doors she
has a 1/3 chance of winning.  Switching doors gives her a 2/3 chance of
winning.  A computer simulation of the game using a random number
generator should convince any skeptics.



Simpson's Paradox:

Proof:

Pr(A>B and A>C) = Pr(A>B and A>C | A=3)*PR(A=3)
                =   .54   *  .56       *   1
                = .3024
                Thus A is the most effective drug ~ 30% of the time.


Pr(B>A and B>C) =   Pr(B>A and B>C | B=1)*Pr(B=1)
                  + Pr(B>A and B>C | B=5)*Pr(B=5)

                =       0   * .56         * .54
                   +    1   * .78         * .46
                = .3588
                Thus B is the most effective drug ~ 36% of the time.


Pr(C>A and C>B) =   Pr(C>A * C>B | C=2)*Pr(C=2)
                  + Pr(C>A * C>B | C=4)*Pr(C=4)
                  + Pr(C>A * C>B | C=6)*Pr(C=6)

                =       0  * .54       *   .22
                  +     1  * .54       *   .22
                  +     1  *  1        *   .22

                = .3388
                Thus C is the most effective drug ~ 34% of the time.


Granted this is a silly way of rating medications, but Simpson's
Paradox actually turned up in a recent investigation to see if there
was sex bias in the admissions of men and women to graduate studies at
the University of California at Berkley.  Independent studies of
admissions of men and women in the fall of 1973 showed a positive sex
bias against female applicants.  Then when the data for men and women
were combined, there was a small but statistically significant bias in
FAVOR of women.  (See "Sex Bias in Graduate Admissions: Data from
Berkeley," by P. J. Bickel, E. A. Hammel and J.  W. O'Connell in
'Science', Vol. 187, February 7, 1975, pages 398-404).



Three-Card Game

The chance that the underside is red is 2 to 1.



THE CHILD PARADOX

Answer 1:  1/2.

Answer 2:  2/3.  The possibilities are Girl-Boy, Boy-Girl, Girl-Girl.

Answer 3:  I'm not sure.  Here's my guess.

         It depends on the probability of the mother naming both her
         children Mary.  If she names all her children Mary then knowing
         one of them is named Mary doesn't help us and the answer as you
         know is 2/3.  If she names only one child Mary, then this
         uniquely identifies the child and the probability is 1/2.  That
         is, there are two mutually exclusive possibilities:  Mary is
         the older child or Mary is the younger child.  In either case
         the probability of the other child being a boy is 1/2.

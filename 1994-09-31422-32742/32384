You can be charged with Possession if you have a marijuana joint in your

The reason the shrink-wrap license is so hard to uphold is because you have
to prove that the person bought the product with the envelope intact.  It is
too easy to say it was second-hand, and it was never in an envelope.

posted that the law can't really do much with that sort of agreement.  After
a phonecall to a lawyer freind of mine, he agreed, and gave that as a
reason.

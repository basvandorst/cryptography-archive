 You spoonfed us saturday morning  mouthful of maggots  and lies disguised in
 your sugary breakfast cereals. The plates you made us clean were filled with
 your fears. These things have hardened in our soft pink bellies. We are what
 you have made us. We have grown up watching your television.We are a sympton
 of your Christian America,  the biggest satan of all.  This is your world in
 which we grow. and we will grow to hate you.                - Marilyn Manson

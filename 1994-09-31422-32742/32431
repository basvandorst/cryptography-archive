When I was at the NSA crypto museum last June, I talked to
a curator who told me that an Enigma had recently been sold in 
Germany for DM24 000.  I think that's in the vicinity of
about US$ 14,000.  Don't worry if you can't afford that,
because it's pretty tough to find one for sale at any price,
I understand.    /mrr

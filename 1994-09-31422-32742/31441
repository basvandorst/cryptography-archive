the encryption implemenation seems OK .... however, like any decent encryption
software, they are export-restricted, of course :-)

There is one question, and some problems.  The question is whether the viruses
do the job of encryption any better than non-replicating software.

The problems:  KOH does not work properly on all machines.  GV1 seems to be
better behaved in that respect, but it has one design "flaw" - if you mis-type
a password, your data is GONE ..... it will decrypt the data using that
password, without checking it was the correct one, and not keep a backup copy
of the encrypted data.

This is no more binding than if they said "BY EATING BREAKFAST TOMORROW 
MORNING, YOU ARE AGREEING TO BE BOUND..."  Nobody can attach conditions to
an action which is my right to do.  If I purchase a software package, I have
the right to open it, install it, and use it.

If the publishers CONSPICUOUSLY put the above on the outside of the package,
such that the above was clearly part of the terms of sale BEFORE I put my 
money downn, their case may be stronger.  If I am required to enter into a
contract (oral or written) before I am allowed to purchase the software, than
their case is stronger yet.  (Notice that in both of these cases, we are still
dealing with an adhesion contract--I am never given an opportunity to negotiate
terms.)  However, any terms and conditions on the inside of the box are
worthless.

... and pray the software wasn't purchased at Egghead.

"Excuse me, but I bought this yesterday, and I don't agree with the terms and
 conditions of the license agreement.  I would like a refund, please?"

"I'm sorry, Sir.  We don't accept returns or exchanges on opened merchandise."

Bullshit.  If they want to do this, you have to agree to it up front.  Other
wise, it is a sale of goods, and the purchaser OWNS what he/she buys.  
Copyright law enjoins the purchaser from certain activities (such as copying 
the software and giving it to his/her friends), but the purchaser is the owner
of a copy of software, and NOT a licensee.

What if I hand the disks, sight unseen, to someone else (who will never use
the program) and let THEM open the package?  Is this person then "bound" by 
the agreement?  What if this person is under 18, and cannot enter into a 
contract?  This is another BIG reason shrinkwrap contracts are unenforcable.

The purchaser does not own the software.  He DOES however, own a copy, which
he can do whatever he/she sees fit with, as long as it doesn't violate some
law.

How would the end user know what a trade secret is?  I mean, if it's secret,
I shouldn't know about it, right?

But don't worry TOO much about they say.

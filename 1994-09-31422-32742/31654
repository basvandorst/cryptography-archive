Sigh.  This thread *started* with a posting by Phil Zimmerman
debunking that myth and several other myths about things like his
involvement and approval/disapproval.  He approves.

There *is* one bug in the random number seed generation, which postings by
Colin Plumb explain (it was his bug :-) and the oneline fix which
changes an = to an ^= were in the posting and are probably in the archives.

In one way, PGP 2.6 is *more* secure than earlier versions, for US users -
it uses RSAREF, so if you're complying with the RSAREF license terms,
and using it non-commercially, you don't have to worry about the
patent police hauling you off to patent court, and if you're on a
system administered by someone else, you can explain to them that it's
legally ok so they don't need to worry about it being on their system.

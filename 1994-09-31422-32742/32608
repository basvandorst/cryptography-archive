Neither is RSA but that didn't stop them from convening a Grand Jury. You
are making that bit up out of whole cloth.

Posting and ITAR is exactly my point. And "Distribution:usa" won't get him
off, since that is advisory and doesn't prevent the post from going overseas
automatically.

As for your reference to the First Amendment, that is nothing but
hand-waving. The ITAR has not been overthrown based on a First Amendment
challenge, nor has one even been brought.

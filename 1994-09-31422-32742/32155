Hi!

I have a question about the TTP, trusted third party
that is needed to manage the directory with public keys
in a public key crypto system. The question is:

Is there any foolproof way to guarantee the authenticity in
the register without giving the TTP a possiblity to by lying
about which key is the correct one, and monotoring the traffic
thus being able to read all traffic?

Do you have to trust the TTP implicitly or is there a
way around this?

If anyone has an idea about this, please reply via email. If
there is any common interest I can post answers.

Regards,
Ingerun

P.s I do not mind trusting the TTP to do a number of
things, I just donot want him to be able to read and/or change
the traffic.

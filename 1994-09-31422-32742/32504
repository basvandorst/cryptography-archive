]Hi,
]As far as I can see, there are three forms of protection a piece of
]software may have:
]1) Patent (only in the USA as far as I know), this protects any algorithms

Incorrect - software can be patented in Europe (e.g. IDEA is patented);
the relevant difference in the USA is that you can patent things up to
one year after publicly disclosing them, and also that the government
can classify patent applications that they consider sensitive national
security material, so RSA and a few other groups have published crypto
material before applying for patents to avoid having the NSA steal them.

Some countries may be more or less restrictive on algorithm and
software patents than the US.

]2) Copyright (applicable everywhere the Berne convention applies), this
]   protects the actual representation of the algorithm (as either source
]   or executable code).
]3) Contractual (enhanced by some trade secret laws in the USA), this
]   protects the software through legal agreement.

Of course, you can't have something both protected by trade secret
laws and also patented, since patents inherently require disclosure.

Maybe, we just should fight back.  Create an stupid ad (MENTOR'S CHOICE:
THE BEST ICE CREAM IN THE WORLD.  DELIVERED TO YOU BUY ...), and place
it on every page of the New York Times.

If they get 1000 letters from people, who were annoyed, then we can say:
nothing else happened to Canter&Siegel.  It is just, that network news
spreads a bit further than the New York Times.

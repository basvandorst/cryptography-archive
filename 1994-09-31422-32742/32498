Sounds similar to the Security Dynamics SecureID.  Yes, that's believed
to be secure.

The general idea is that each card has a clock, some sort of keyed
cryptographic function, and (of course) the key.  The value displayed
is the function applied to the key and the clock.  A possible function
is DES, using the key and encrypting the time.  The host also knows the
time, of course, and encrypts it with its copy of the user's key.
Actually, it encrypts the time for a few minutes in either direction,
to deal with clock skew.  I've heard that the Security Dynamics host
software learn each card's skew characteristics, so they know how much
of a window to leave.

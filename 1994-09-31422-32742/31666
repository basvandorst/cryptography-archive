Speaking as an interested and somewhat informed user (read: I'm not an expert, 
and I'm sure the experts will correct me if I'm wrong), this very fact is the 
paradox in using any and all cryptosystems.  There is no really good way of 
evaluating the security of a cryptosystem except by trying to break it; if 
everyone's attempts fail, then it is christened with the label "secure".  Once 
it is broken, though, then it is considered "insecure".  Unfortunately, there 
is no way of knowing what attacks or flaws might surface in a system ahead of 
time; the only way of finding them is to find them, as it were.

This was the meaning of my earlier statement.  Factoring (and yes, Sternlight, 
I do realize the seriousness of the factoring attack) is the best presently 
known attack against RSA.  I can say this with as much assurance as I can say 
that there is no weakness in IDEA, for example, since the best efforts of many 
people have not unearthed a crack in it.

The only metric that I have seen as a gauge of a cryptosystem's security is 
its effective age; i.e. how long it took to crack it or how long it has 
withstood cracking.  Under that gauge, RSA is doing pretty well, as it has 
stood somewhere close to fifteen years of scrutiny.  IDEA, on the other hand, 
is relatively new from the reports I've heard, and is therefore less "secure" 
in that sense.  Traditional DES had an effective life of about twenty years, 
but is now considered broken.

Of course (to avoid flames), I must except the one-time pad cryptosystem from 
all of the above, since that particular cryptosystem has been mathematically 
proven to be unbreakable.

It is the best known method.  If you have a better, I'm sure there are quite a 
few people around who would like to hear it.

I don't think it's possible to PROVE that factoring is the best attack against 
RSA, just as it's impossible to PROVE that brute-force is the best attack 
against other cryptosystems.  Yes, you're right; the spooks just MIGHT have 
found a better method of attacking RSA.  But that possibility exists for ALL 
cryptosystems (except the one-time pad), such as DES, IDEA, Blowfish, etc., 
etc.

By serious, I had in mind the notorious "xorbytes" security bug, which 
is both minor (reducing the randomness of the numbers used in the key 
generation process) and easily fixed from the source code.

I know of no other security-related bugs in MIT PGP 2.6.

Under a "probabilistic" heading.  In other words - RSA is *probably* safe.

The experts can here insert the appropriate numbers detailing how likely it is 
to be broken within the next [year - decade - century].

'Tis the sad truth.  But at least most of us try to work against that sinful 
nature. :-)

I ran into an old friend who it turned out was working on a quantum
computer project.  Unfortunately, he *hadn't* kept current with
advances in conventional factoring techniques, so he was seriously
bummed when he found out that "serious" RSA keys are up to 1024 bits
these days.  He was contemplating factoring numbers of ~90 decimal
digits, and was astounded to hear about the RSA129 success.

His description to me was that in order to make any sense of the
results when attempting to factor a number <n>, one had to be able to
distinguish between <n> different angular positions.  When <n> is near
2**1024, this is very difficult.

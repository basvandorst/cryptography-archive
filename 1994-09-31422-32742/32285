Gaaaack! While it is true that I suggested trade secret laws were the
lesser of the worries of the poster, seeing me as part of a compound noun
with Sternlight is most discomforting and may lead people to believe that
we agree on more than the simple facts of the RC4 situation.
I still think that RSA Data Security has the burden to prove that a
trade secret was improperly published, and I also believe that the State
Department has the burden of showing that source code published as
ASCII text on the internet can be categorized as "exporting munitions".

While I would not like to be the test case, this incident could
be the one that ends up at the supreme court, assuming they will
catch the perpetrator. A miniscule possibility, methinks.

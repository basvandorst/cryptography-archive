As I understand the license, use of PGP 2.6 is allowable in a commercial
setting as long as it does not generate income.  In other words, I would have
to use Viacrypt PGP to accept credit-card orders over the net.  If I have
misinterpreted the license, by all means let me know--but I don't think I
have.

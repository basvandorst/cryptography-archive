Hard in the USA since "first to invent" is the operative rule for
patents. Ie, Company A would simply have to present evidence that they had
invented it first to nullify B's patent. Now in countries with first to
file laws I guess it is possible.

I believe that the USA is going over to "first to file" as well as most
other countries.

: What do you mean by it uses a longer key schedule?
: Does it do more encryption rounds?

: I thought Biham & Shamir's book on differential cryptanalysis

It uses more variations in the subkeys, I believe it is provably
at least as secure as original DES (unlike random messing with the
S-boxes), but you are right that it adds little, if any, security in
a post-differential attack world.

 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
I've seen it in action: stories have filtered back down to me of confiscation
and wanton destruction of personal property on allegations of racketeering
from distant relatives and friends of friends of ... etc. My mother had a very
difficult time getting her car back when my sister witnessed a car wreck! It
took almost half the worth of the car in lawyer's fees to get it back.
	My understanding is that many law enforcement institutions use the
confiscated property for funding, and in particular, that it is responsible for
the air conditioning systems in not a few Philadelphia police stations.
	With the Digital Telephony Act and The Clipper Proposal alongside this,
I would say that the US is forgetting entirely the issues which brought it into
existence.
	I see two possibilities: Sternlight gets laughed at again, and RSADSI
knows it can't do much about it; or, a destructive witchhunt will yield some
scapegoat, possibly even targeting the Cypherpunks, maybe even inventing some
imagined pattern of racketeering, pinning whatever they can on the scapegoat.
That's the scary thing about RICO, if I know it well enough (which I may not):
all they have to do is suspect. Suppose the Cypherpunks were targeted: wouldn't
that enable the FBI or whomever to confiscate machines upon which suspected 
Cypherpunks were suspected to have accounts?
	Much of this looks ripe for further cross-posting to misc.legal, whether
to correct whatever misconceptions I have regarding RICO, or to further augment
the discussion. 

	I will try to post something worthwhile, like code, sometime in the
near future to make up for polluting sci.crypt with this little bit of politics.

	Damn I hate political posts. Especially the ones I make.

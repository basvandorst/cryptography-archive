It clearly doesn't apply since DES is freely available and there are export
regulations. I'm not going to get into a semantic disopute about
interpretation based on quotes out of context by non-attorneys. An expert
would have to review the legal definition of "public domain" in the ITAR,
not elsewhere, and the language in the ITAR which excludes some things from
"public domain" before understanding this.

What you are doing is both common and sophomoric in net legal discussions.
You take a phrase from the law, assume it means either what the dictionary
or common sense says, and then try to make an argument from that. But
various laws often define words uniquely and explicitly, for the purposes of
a specific statute or even an individual contract. When a statute or law
defines a word, that definition overrides any non-legal definition for the
purposes of that statute or law.

We see another example in the discussion about the California trade secrets
law. A layman is attempting to argue that if someone published it without
permission, it is no longer a secret. But the particular statute defines
secret (for the purposes of that statute and its penalties) in terms of the
owner of the secret having taken steps to protect it, not in terms of
whether it is "known" due to the unauthorized acts of other parties.

As I get older (and usenet newsgroups age one REAL fast), I get smarter at
more quickly noticing a user trying to shift attention from substance by
personal attack. I've also learned that it is a sign of a very weak position
on the substance.

Given the above attempt by Rubin I am reminded why discussion with him
quickly degenerates into incivility and flaming, and I'm not having any just
now, thanks.

Just a followup to this.  Someone mailed me and said that HP-UX
continues to use a rotor scheme to this day.  Appearantly they've kept
the old version 6 code around.

So, to summarize: yes, a rotor scheme was used but this changed to DES
with version 7.  HP-UX appearantly kept the rotor scheme around which
is how I ended up getting the correct, but not generalizable,
impression that a rotor scheme is still used :-).

Having said that, what does this say about HP-UX password security?
Is a rotor scheme "enough" for this particular application?

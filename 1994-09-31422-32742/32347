In fact, reverse engineering can not be an improper means to discover
*any* trade secret.  The only things which can make reverse engineering
legally punishable are:

1) A patent, or
2) A valid, negotiated confidentality agreement violated by the
reverse-engineer.

See the Supreme Court decision Bonito Boats v. Thundercraft, 489 U.S. 141
(1989).  The Court will preemept any law which interferes with the
objectives of the federal patent laws.

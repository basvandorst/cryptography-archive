Readers who are interested in fast high-precision multiplication should
check out:

   Dan Zuras, "More on Squaring and Multiplying Large Numbers", IEEE
   Transactions on Computers, V43 #8 (August 1994)

He describes a family of algorithms that are a generalization of
Karatsuba's "2-way" method, the fastest of which is O(n^1.365).  These
are easier to implement than FFT and have much less fixed overhead.  He
reports experiments showing better performance than FFT up through
numbers of 37 million bits, although this is somewhat dependent on the
characteristics of the HP-9000 implementation.  I don't know enough
about FFTs to say whether the tests used the optimal FFT techniques, but
the "N-way" algorithms presented are impressive regardless.

The factoring result is due to Peter Shor and was in FOCS 94, I
believe.  It is clever and uses no very deep math or physics.
However, no currently conceived physical hardware can possibly
implment the algorithm.  The theorem is like one of those calculations
in relativity theory, involving automobiles that go near the speed of
light.

You might first want to read Dan Simon's paper in FOCS 94, which has a
more self-contained explanation of quantum computing, with lots of
references.  Shor's paper starts where Simon's leaves off, sort of.

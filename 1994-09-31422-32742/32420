First, there is a bit of a terminology problem in
our question as posed above.

You are using "decrypt" to mean something that is
more precisely described as something like "crypanalysis
By trial and error".   Ordinarily, one knows one
has decrypted because one knows that one has used
the correct algorithm and key to decrypt the desired
message.

To answer your question, the most direct way do
distinguish most types of plaintext from
noise would be to compute an autocorrelation function,
and look for correlation in the signal.  If
one had a guess as to the nature of the plaintext,
faster algorithms could be used, but the 
correlation method is very general.

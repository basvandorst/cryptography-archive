   OK, that would be about 512 bits, and I am probably heavily
   overestimating it, but I like to play on the safe side. You didn't
   specify such things like cost, time, memory speed, and so on, so I
   couldn't hope for a more exact estimation anyway.

With respect, I'd suggest that 512 bits is rather on the low side.  A
ball-park figure for factoring 512-bit integers is around 1e5 mips-years.
Don't hold me to that to better than a factor of three, and don't
remind me that the current factoring alogrithms are better measured by
memory performance than cpu speed.  The latter two are correlated
quite well anyway.

The kilo-processor i860 or Alpha boxes now being built (Sandia has a
nice one, I believe) could do a 512-bit key in about a year.  A
thousand of them could probably factor 600-bit keys in a few months
each.  Finding the money to buy and run a thousand of them would be an
interesting challenge in its own right.

   > multiply it by four. 

   OK, that makes the keys be 514-bit long. You mean, your rule with
   slime like NSA/NRO is to use 514-bit keys? Nahh, they look too

Ok, here's the promised pedantry.  The "it" in the quoted phrase
clearly refers to "the largest key LENGTH you can conceive of"
(emphasis added).  Adding two bits might increase the magnitude of the
modulus four-fold, but it does not quadruple its length.  Following
this prescription would give 2048-bit keys by your criterion, 2400 by
mine.

   insecure to me, especially if one has to rely on them for a long time
   - lie 50 years or so. I'll stick to something better - like 1024-bit
   keys, thank you.

IMO, 1024-bit keys should be ok for a few decades.  Not sure I'd bet
any significant amount of money on them lasting 50 years though.

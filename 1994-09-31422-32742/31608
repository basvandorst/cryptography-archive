About a month ago, Terry Ritter posted a useful reference:

Bardell, P.  1990, "Analysis of Cellular Automata Used as Pseudorandom 
Pattern Generators", Proceedings of 1990 International Test Conference.  
(IEEE)  762-768.
 
  "It is shown that the bit sequence from a stage of a CA is identical to 
   that from te LFSR found by the similarity transformation."  [1: 762]

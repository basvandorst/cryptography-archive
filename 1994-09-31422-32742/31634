There's an article in the last Communications of the ACM on solving
simple substitution ciphers using a maximum-likelihood method based on
common words.  Has anybody out there implemented this?  I've thought
about hacking it up myself but I figured I should check if anyone else
has code they'd be willing to distribute first.

He didn't say that they write off the whole Internet as "anti-capitalist
bozos."  He only said that RSADSI would be inundated by those ACBs who are
out there.  Even if only a few percent of the people out there were ACBs,
and only a few percent of them responded in a negative fashion to messages
from RSADSI, that would still be hundreds or thousands of ACBs sending
their flames to RSADSI every time RSADSI had something to say.  I can't
say that I'd want to stir up that stinkpot either.

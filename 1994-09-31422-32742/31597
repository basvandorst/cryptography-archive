My company has been producing One Time Pads on CD-ROM for several
months now.  The CD-ROM format has many advantages,it is relatively
inexpensive, one pair is $150.00(US Dollars), which is cheaper than
some software packages. It is a standard, anyone can buy a cheap
CD-ROM drive (less than $200).  The software is easy to use and 
understand, the encryption method does not rely on obscure
mathematical formulas that the common user cannot understand.  The
encrypted files can never be decrypted unless the security of 
the pad is compromised, we allknow even PGP will become vulnerable
in 10 years or so with faster machines and mor ememory.

It is true that you cannot erase the bits as they are used, there is
some problem with every method but it is expected that the cd-rom 
will be kept secure and this should not be a  serious security concern, 
after all where the cd-rom is stored is likely where the unencrypted
messages are also stored.

I do know that you cant patent a otp cdrom but you could
patent the process used to create it, supposing that it was not something
common.  I use random radio noise passed through a CFB DES filter.

The one problem I have encountered is shipping, for a pad that
only costs $150 most people are concerned about paying $500 for
a private courier to pick it up and fly back, and using FedEx
and UPS to ship something of such value is questionable

As for security, well at some point you have to trust someone unless
you do everything yourself and most people
cannot afford to take the time to do the research needed to do
encryption right.  You have to trust the programmer not to have
left backdoors in commercial packages(not a good idea) and you
have to trust that the random pad is random, but at least you 
can analyize the pad to see tha it IS random(high entropy) and
you can see the code and understand how it works.  Using
radio noise is not reproducable(the way we do it) and the des 
filter assures that the bits are re-randomized

Hope I have either cleared things up or contributed to everyones confusion.

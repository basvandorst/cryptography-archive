Give your defamatory posts a rest. I was far from the first to post material
on RC4, and I am far from the most prolific poster on this topic, and I'm
not talking about the science of RC4.

Unless your mind reading abilities are rather better than the rest of us
mortals, you have no idea why I'm posting here. But your arrogance has been
demonstrated over and over  by your posts. Why am I not surprised?

Well, Jim, I am also a beginner with crypto, but I can see that this is a
stream cipher, not a OTP. A OTP must have its numbers generated by a truly
unpredictable means, and hence they cannot be re-created. That is why
copies _must_ be made.
This is a stream cipher based on a pseudo-random number generator, and
unlike a OTP (which is perfectly secure if used properly), the security
depends on how good the PRNG is. Most are lousy, and the good ones are very
slow. Read the FAQ.

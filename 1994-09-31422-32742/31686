According to "The American Codebreakers" by Thomas Parrish, p. 55,
Navy Comint was informed of SIS's reconstruction of Purple as soon
as the work was done (September 1940, see below).  Are you referring
to something different?

     Once the design was completed.. creation of an operational machine
   took only a few days. ... Without ever having seen a Purple machine
   or any part of one, the Americans had created their own.  Friedman
   and Rowlett sought out General Mauborgne, who had been the chief signal
   officer since 1937 and was a pioneer in radio intelligence and
   a driving force behind the work of the SIS.  They wanted permission
   to reveal their success to the navy.  It was important, they felt
   that navy cryptanalysts be made aware of the cryptographic concepts
   that had been uncovered and the analytical techniques that had been
   developed in the successful attack on Purple.  By all means, agreed
   the general.
     Friedman telephoned [Navy Comint director] Safford, inviting
   him in a more or less casual way to come by the office the next
   morning.  When the commander arrived, he was led into a room with
   a table on which sat an object covered with a black cloth.  They
   had something to tell him about Purple, Friedman said; they'd done
   some work and were ready to share the results.  Then Friedman turned
   the floor over to Rowlett, who stepped to the table, grasped the
   black cover, and lifted it from the machie.  Safford's lean
   face was tense; his eyes seemed to pop.
     "My God!  Where'd you steal it?"
     Friedman turned a bit lofty.  "We built it ourselves".
     "Unbelievable!"
     Rowlett now switched on the machine.  Safford, intently watching
   and listening, "exuded praise from every pore".  He was amazed, he
   said, that the SIS team had succeeded in breaking such a complex
   cryptographic system, and he was greatly impressed by the quietly
   efficient electromechanical performance of the reconstructed
   model in front of him.

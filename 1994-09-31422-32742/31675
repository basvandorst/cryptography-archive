In his talk at the recent RSA Labs Seminar, A.K. Lenstra speculated as to
where Rivest got that 4 quadrillion years number from.  Elsewhere in the
Scientific American, the "fastest of todays comupters" was said to be
able to do a modular multiplication on 126-digit numbers in 1 nanosecond.

This is unusually fast, even by today's standards.

Anyway, Pollard's rho method of factoring requires 4 quadrillion years
on the above machine.

The reality is that 129-digits was 10^19 times easier than predicted.

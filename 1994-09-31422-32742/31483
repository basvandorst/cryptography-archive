The difference with crypt(3) is the the user's password is taken as the 
encryption key and uses it encrypt a 64-bit stream of zeros with DES. 
The resultant is re-encrypted with the users key. This is repeated for a 
total of 25 times. (default of many systems but should be changed by 
thwark dictionary attacks). The resultant 64 bits is unpacked into a 
string of 11 printable characters (uuencode) and stored in /etc/passwd 
(dependend on shadow)

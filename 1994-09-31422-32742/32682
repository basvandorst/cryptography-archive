Another clause of the code that David posted said that if you know or have
reason to know that the information was derived from trade secret
violation, further disclosure or use without permission is theft of the
trade secret.  Since RSADSI has made public announcements that the
relevation must have been due to someone violating an NDA, we all now "have
reason to know" that RC4 is a trade secret, and we may not use it without
permission.

Once you become aware that information is a former secret that was revealed
through improper means, you must treat it as a trade secret.

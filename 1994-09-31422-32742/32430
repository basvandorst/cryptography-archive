A word of warning, folks. The United States Code is like a patent: If it 
says something is illegal, it's presumed to be illegal until a court says 
_otherwise_. If you are convicted of violating ITAR, you have the dubious 
privilege of being allowed to challenge its constitutionality. But unless you
get off easy or are rich or powerful enough to be granted appeal bond, 
you'll be mounting your challenge from a federal correctional institution.

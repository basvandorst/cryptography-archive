I beg your pardon.  I am licensed to practice law in both Pennsylvania and
New Jersey.

The seminal case finding that state law validating and making enforceable
"shrink-wrap" licenses is preempted by the Copyright Act is _Vault Corp.
v. Quaid Software Ltd._, 847 F.2d 255 (5th Cir. 1988).  

The trial court held that the "contract" contained in the license
agreement was unenforceable in the absence of enabling legislation as an 
"adhesion contract".  The enabling legislation was preempted as an attempt
to frustrate section 117 of the Copyright act.  But don't take my word for
it -- go read (and Shepardize) the case yourself.

This isn't legal advice.  Get your own lawyer.

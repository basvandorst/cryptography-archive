If anyone wants a sample of what this book covers, I will email them
the prologue to the book. Also, price in CONUS is $24 vice $26.
Companion volume Hobbyist's COMINT Russian RTTY Dictionary went to
printers today. This dictionary enables people who don't speak a single word
of Russian, and who can't read Cyrillic to get a fair idea of the contents 
of the numerous Russian communications that appear on the shortwave 
bands daily.

Of special interest to sci.crypt fans may be the section on 
KRIPTOGRAMMA messages (which covers at least four different encryption
systems the Russians continue to use). Russian radio (RTTY) traffic is 
starting to pick up again. This Phoenix may arise from the ashes. 

Who knows maybe the RFNV (Moscow) Cuban (COL) CW link might even return 
for Boris's flight!

In general, you will want to use a public key system (e.g. RSA) to exchange
session keys for a traditional algorithm (e.g. DES or IDEA) that will encrypt
the actual data.

A good reference on these topics is:

	Applied Cryptography
	by Bruce Schneier

Which will get into the details.

sci.crypt is probably a more appropriate newsgroup for this discussion, and
I have directed followups there.

[David Sternlight has proposed changing the charter of sci.crypt to
include legal discussion.]

Well, I have to try to drum up business for my associates; union rules,
you know :-).

Seriously, there are two issues here:

1) *How* can the charter be modified.
2) *Should* the charter be modified.

Question 2 can't be answered until Question 1 is.  The experts on that
live in news.groups.  Anyone seeking to change the charter should contact
news.groups, tale@uunet.uu.net and possibly rdippold@qualcomm.com, the
head of the Usenet Volunteer Votetakers for advice on how to go about this.
THEY will post the formal RFD.  In the meantime, we shouldn't clutter up
sci.crypt with discussion.  I have set followups to news.groups; I hope
the good folks there will give us plenty of advice.

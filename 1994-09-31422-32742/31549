Wolfram's book is "Theory and Applications of Cellular Automata,"
1986, World Scientific. Several papers on using CAs for random
sequence generation. (Like I said in my earlier post, I think someone
showe in the last couple of years that CAs produce the outputs of
LFSRs.)

Wolfram also has a paper, "Cryptography with cellular automata," in
Proc. CRYPTO 85.

: Again, can you give me a pointer. (not that I question your veracity :)
: Also any other studies on CA properties.

Sorry, I would've thought my "I recall hearing...." line was
indication enough that I don't have a reference in front of me. I
_think_ the result was in the CRYPTO '91 or '92 proceeedings.

A few weeks back somebody posted a Pascal program
to do this.  But it wasn't _everything_ you want;
start time (and stop time and duration) remains
quantized; ... now it's in 5 minute intervals
rather than 30 minute intervals.

I think the originating site was University
of Hawaii (or Hawaii Polytechnic).

But, as D. Sternlight points out, Gemstar products
now let you encode and decode, in both directions,
right from the keypad, so why not do it the easy way?


  Undergraduate homework problem: VCR+ is able to
  assign unique code numbers to all programs
  on all (64) channels for 31 days.  How many different
  possibilities exist, of
         day of month
         starting time
         channel number
         program duration
  ?  Is the number less than 10^6?  less than 10^8?

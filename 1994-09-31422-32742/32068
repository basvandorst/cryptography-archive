As most of you probably know, source code to RC4 was anonymously posted
to sci.crypt and to the Cypherpunks mailing list, and is now available
for anonymous ftp from sites all over the world.  The following is RSA
Data Security, Inc.'s response to this.  It seems like they wish to stuff
the genie back into the bottle.

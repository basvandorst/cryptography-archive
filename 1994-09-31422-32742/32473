: As for "trade secret" it's a term of art referring to the material--it is
: still a trade secret in law even if someone has improperly exposed it.

Ok, if I knew a secret, say for instance, it was only me who knew that my
sister had an affair with another person but her husband(just a
hypothetical example), and no one else knew beside me that she had it,
because it was only me who knew her and her husband, and it was me who saw
her with that other person than her husband kissing today in the parking
lot, THIS I could define as a secret. But how can it be a secret if it's
known by one more person other than me? Or in this case a million
others... Use your common sense, and tell me : CAN that info be declared
as a secret any longer, after it has been brought to the attention in the
eyes of millions? Well you answer this one. I'd be glad to argue
further.... :-). And laws were concieved with the purpose to enforce that 
common sense, right?

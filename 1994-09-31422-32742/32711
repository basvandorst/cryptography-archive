   George Hart, the author of the article, has placed his program in the 
   public domain. Retrieve the following files via anonymous FTP:

     ftp.ctl.columbia.edu: /users/hart/DECP.C, DECP.DOC, and DECIPHER.DCT.

The original address has errors: "ctr" not "ctl", and the filenames
are lowercase.

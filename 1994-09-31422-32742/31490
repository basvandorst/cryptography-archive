Can you give me a title or other pointer? I'd like to read it.

Again, can you give me a pointer. (not that I question your veracity :)
Also any other studies on CA properties.

The program I saw wasn't for PKC, as it just XORed the ciphertext with the 
encrypted key a second time to decrypt. 

If anyone wants the single pass program, it was Wincrypt by Jeff Prosise,
from the article in the July 94 issue of PC Magazine.
The working program with c source is wincry.zip in vol13n13.zip on Simtel,
in Simtel/msdos/pcmag/vol13n13.zip. I got it off a local mirror, but I
know it is also at oak.oakland.edu.

Cheers
Andrew

No one seems to have commented on the fact that the California Trade Secret
Act probably cannot constitutionally be applied to prevent members of the
general public from copying, or making, using, and selling, an algorithm
or section of code like the alleged RC4 code that has become widely
disseminated and thus public, even though the secret was originally released
to the public by someone who obtained the former secret improperly or who
released it in violation of a non-disclosure agreement.

There are two reasons for this, one being the first amendment's protection
of free speach.  The other, and stronger, constitutional argument is simply
that a state law forbidding the use or copying of information that is in
fact generally available to the public is the equivalent of a patent or a
copyright, and only the federal government can constitutionally grant
patents or copyrights.  

It thus seems highly improbable that the information can be put back in the
bottle even if, as seems unlikely, it was not obtained by reverse engineering
or by some other means that is forbidden by the California Trade Secrets
law.
    
Please note that I have removed sci.crypt from the follow-up line.

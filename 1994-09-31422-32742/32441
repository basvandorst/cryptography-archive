I don't think so!!!!  It is a bit stronger than merely an "operative rule".
Perusing the US Constitution, I find:
"8.  To promote the progress of science and useful arts, by
securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to
their respective writings and discoveries:"
                              ^^^^^^^^^^^
I understand that this means "first to invent", not "first to file".

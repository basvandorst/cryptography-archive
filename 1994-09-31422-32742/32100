You may be in error on this. Many companies use trade secret protection in
preference to patents, and if it were that weak they wouldn't. I suggest you
check with an experienced attorney in these matters.

To use a parallel, receiving stolen property is a felony even if you weren't
the thief. I think this is enough of a straw in the wind to require careful
investigation of your claim, though I don't want to push the parallel so far
as to claim that the revealed trade secret is stolen property, without an
attorney's opinion.

But if the agreement between Lotus and RSADSI requires Lotus to pass on the
trade secret protection agreements (including no reverse engineering) to
Lotus' customers, then you are still bound by them if Lotus does discharge
its obligation in, say, their license agreement with you.

Note, by the way, that what had been called shrink-wrap agreements are
strengthened against claims attacking them by sealing the disks separately,
with the text of the agreement and the notice that if you don't agree with
it you're not to open the sealed envelope but instead to return the product
for a refund. Most such agreements are printed right on that inner envelope.
Thus it's no longer a "shrink-wrap" agreement since you have the opportunity
to either accept it or return the disks unopened after you have been given
the opportunity to become fully familiar with the terms. Since such products
are licensed, not sold, the license has not changed hands unless you agree
to the terms, and you acquire no property rights in the product either
before or after you open the outer shrink-wrap.

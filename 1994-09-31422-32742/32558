Basics of how the algorithms work can be found from files available 
by anonymous FTP from rsa.com, I think they are called MD4.TXT and
MD5.TXT.  There are also some articles discussing the security of these
hash functions:  For a good list of referneces, and a quick description of
MD5, see the chapter on hash functions from Schneier's _Applied 
Cryptography_.

RSADSI says every legitimate copy carries a non-disclosure, no reverse
engineering agreement. I believe them. Based on that, SOMEONE had to violate
his agreement along the way. If someone HAD TO, then the reverse engineer
got his copy as a result of a chain at some point of which the conditions in
the California Penal Code were triggered which made every subsequent user or
publisher of the thing liable to criminal penalties even if that subsequent
user or publisher did not himself steal the thing or violate a
non-disclosure agreement.

Note that if you use a trade secret without permission, under the California
Code you are guilty of theft. Theft is the language of the code, not my
language. See my reposting of the code in another message.

No. At some point along the way someone had to violate a duty of secrecy, or
to steal. How else could it get passed on? Even if it was carelessly left
out, that was a violation of a duty of secrecy. That poisoned all subsequent
activities with respect to the thing.

Nope. Let's assume your prior. Then the software vendor, by not performing
due diligence in getting a binding agreement from the "purchaser", violated
a duty of secrecy. Same result--the fruit is then from a poisoned tree.

RSADSI's argument is that the conditions were iron-clad and thus you didn't
have to "know" from knowledge of events, but rather that logically there
were no other possibilities and thus you had to "know" the way you "know"
the Q.E.D. of an Euclidean theorem.

Read the California Code. Its most general provision in the matter is that
if you use a trade secret without permission you are guilty of theft. The
language is that simple, and that explicit. And the law makes no provision
that if someone published the thing it stops being a trade secret.

Nope. But thanks for maintaining a civil tone.

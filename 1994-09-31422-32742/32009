Was the code obtained through fraud? Doubtful. It was probably obtained
through reverse engineering of a legally acquired copy of some product
like Lotus Notes. The trade secret is bust, broken, defunct.

I may as well admit, now that the code has been made public, that I was
planning to do the same thing---but Bidzos was remarkably uncooperative
when I asked him to sell me an RC4 program. Oh, well. He probably thinks
of me as uncooperative too. [chuckle]

I doubt this. They showed the code to some NSA people who, I suspect,
wouldn't sign a non-disclosure agreement with RSADSI even if they could.

Shrink-wrap agreements are not enforceable. You walk into a store and
buy a product. You now own that product and can do lots of things with
it. Your freedom is not restricted by pseudo-legalistic gobbledygook
printed on the package---even if the gobbledygook says otherwise.

Do you think they can prove that the trade secret wasn't discovered by
analysis of their products? [snicker]

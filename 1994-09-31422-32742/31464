What is a `compressible string'?  For any string of bits you care to
propose, I can construct a trivial compression algorithm that compresses
that string.  The definitions need to be more precise.  How about the
following: `an infinite stream of bits is random if no algorithm can
compress all its finite substrings longer than some specific length.'  The
length requirement is needed because a non-random bit-string may show
periodic repetitions; in that case, substrings shorter than the period may
be incompressible, even though longer substrings are compressible.

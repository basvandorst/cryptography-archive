I don't believe Conway's life would provide enough randomness,
regardless of the number of rounds.  If you do too many rounds, the
pattern would usually become all zeros.

Even with only one round, you'll tend to have more zeros than ones.
That alone is more information about the XOR bits than you'd like to
give away.  There are also XOR bits that you can't ever get regardless
of the key, and knowledge of those impossible patterns might help
cryptanalysis.  Finally, I'd guess a smart program could reduce the
number of starting possibilities to something you could brute-force
search.

Cellular automata in general could be made to do good cryptography,
but only if designed for that.  I don't see how that's any easier than
designing an algorithm without the automata.

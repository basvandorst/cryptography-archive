So far, so good.

It is not in the least clear that *any* copies of RC4 carry an enforceable
license agreement.  A license agreement is a *contract*.  For a contract
to be enforceable there must be mutual assent.  If this license was a
"shrink wrap" license, it is a _post-facto_ attempt to modify the terms of
a contract, or a contract of "adhesion", and thus completely unenforceable.

Also, innocent users of the RC4 code (those who did not misappropriate)
can not be guilty of trade secret misappropriation, as such is preempted
as a "common law copyright" under section 301 of the Copyright Act of 1976.

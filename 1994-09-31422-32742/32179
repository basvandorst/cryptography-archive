If that were the case, it would be a simple matter for someone either
anonymous or having little to lose personally to expose extraordinarily
valuable trade secrets and vitiate them.

My guess is that "unwitting" parties are probably immune UNTIL notice is
posted that they can be presumed to have seen. At that point everybody who
can be presumed to have seen the notice becomes culpable if they continue to
repubublish, much less use the trade secret.

But we're both guessing laymen--we need an attorney who is expert in trade
secrets law here to advise us.

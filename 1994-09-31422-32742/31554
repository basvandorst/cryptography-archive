I do not agree. Read farther:

This process causes the pseudo infinite key to be a very compli-
cated function of the output of the 9 random number generators,
but is a simple process to program and execute.

One criticism of this method might be that it is a substitution
cipher only and that a combination of a transposition and substi-
tution produces the strongest cipher schemes. The normal transpo-
sition process is what makes the TNT program run so slow. In a
sense CRYP does have a transposition process but it is a transpo-
sition in the pseudo infinite key instead of in the text.

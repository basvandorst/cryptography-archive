  As I said Magic was a blanket name used by the US which covered
Ultra, PURPLE, RED, Fish, and a few other high-level intercepts.  As a
division of labor, the British took the lead on German codes and
ciphers, and the Americans took the lead on Japanese codes and
ciphers, but the co-operation was very close--there were Americans
working at Bletchley Park in some of the "huts."  The US built many of
Bombes and had a roomful in Washington, etc.  This also worked in
reverse, the US gave the British at least one PURPLE machine, etc.,
and all intercepts deemed important were sent to the appropriate
commands of whichever nationality.

   A good book on this is _The Ultra Americans_ by Thomas Parrish,
published in soft cover as _The American Codebreakers, the US Role in
Ultra_, by Scarborough House in 1991.

   It will also tell you the tale of how Marian Rejewski, Jerzy
Rosicki and Henryk Zygalski in Poland managed to crack the Enigma.  In
part they relied on information provided by an informer in the German
Chiffrierstelle code named Asche' to the French via Capt. Gustave
Bertrand. The information provided by Bertrand was a big help, but
what you have to realize is that Rejewski figured out how to break
messages enciphered by Enigma machines without knowing the keys or the
wiring of the rotors.  There is s big difference between knowing how
to decipher messages and knowing how to decrypt them.

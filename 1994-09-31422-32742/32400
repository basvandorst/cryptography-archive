Your nit pick is actually inaccurate. Fidonet, for example, is a series of
dial-up bulletin board systems, but when you post to a Fidonet "forum" (or
whatever it's called) the posts are automatically sent around the world,
just as they are on Usenet newsgroups. There are a few other systems (First
Class BBS's, for example) which behave in similar ways, often by the
inclusion of usenet newsgroups themselves.

The functional distinction between Usenet and some families of BBS systems
has disappeared some time ago.

It is proven secure- Ie, you can know with certainly that you have
secretly transmitted your message to the other person (or at lest with a
very high probability) and you know with certainty that no one else
could break now or forever the message you have sent.

It is difficult. A quantum secure line is also a very secure line for
traditional message exchange. Teh key advantage is knowing with high
probability when someone is listening.

It is very very prone to "denial of service" attacks. Not much you can
do about that.

I've seen that kind of assertion in at least one telephone directory
(I don't recall in which country) and in at least one passport (leased
to me by the United States government).  I did not have to pay any fee
specifically for the telephone directory and would not have received
any discount had I not received the directory.  I did pay a fee for
the passport and was not given an opportunity to read or agree to a
license of this sort before paying for it.  Are these licenses void?

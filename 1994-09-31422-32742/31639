   After RSA129 was recently broken, one of these fellows said something to
   the effect of "I pulled that number out of my ass."  He regretted making
   such a wild guess.

Well, the estimate is attributed to Ron Rivest.  At the press
conference he tried to figure where that number came from, and he said
he didn't remember where it came from.  From the RSA-129 experience,
my guess is that they meant 40 quadrillion _instructions_, which is
quite close to the estimate of the number of instructions executed in
the RSA-129 project (I think the estimate of what we used was between
1.7 and 17 quadrillion instructions, but I don't remember exactly).

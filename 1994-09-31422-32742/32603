I think this to be more muddying of the waters.

The presenting issue was the assertion that if it was done by reverse
engineering it is ok because the law permits reverse engineering. Your
specific statement is that the law says reverse engineering is ok. It does
not.

The truth is that it may or may not be ok depending on whether certain other
conditions are ALSO met:

1. The reverse engineer may not have stolen the trade secret;
2. The reverse engineer may not have violated a duty to secrecy;
3. The reverse engineer may not be presumed to know that someone else did 1
or 2.

THAT is what the California Code says, not that "reverse engineering is ok".

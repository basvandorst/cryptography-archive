The answer is to the first part is YES, assuming the existence of
one-way functions.

Zero knowledge proofs exist for all languages in PSPACE, not just NP,
under the above assumption. ZKPs under the assumption for NP-complete
languages were demonstrated in [GMW], and extended to PSPACE in [BG+].

There is a more recent result due to Ostrovsky and Widgerson [OW] that
unless very weak one-way functions exist, ZKPs can be generated only
for languages in BPP. This further strengthens the need for the
assumption above. [OW] remark in their paper:

	``very loosely speaking, zero knowledge proofs are either
        useless (exist only for weak languages), or universal (exist
        for every provable language)''

depending on whether one-way functions exist.

Hope this helps somewhat.

Thank you, David.  Since I have no intention of witholding the owner of a 
trade secret control over such trade secret, I wouldn't be guilty of 
theft if I used it.  Some other person already deprived RSADSI of a trade 
secret, and if they did so by violation of a nondisclosure agreement, 
then I think that they are clearly guilty of theft.  If they reverse 
engineered it legitimately, then I wish that they would say so and give 
some details on how they did it.  Something seems to have been lost, 
probably due to theft, since RC-4 can no longer be considered secret in 
any normal sense, and never will be again.

I wouldn't recommend using RC-4 without permission, nor will I sell 
anything with RC-4 in it without permission, given the current state of 
affairs.  On the other hand, I don't think that it would be easy to prove 
that anyone but the original thief had an intent to deprive RSADSI of the 
control of a trade secret, since that has already been done in a big 
way.  I think that a sense of decency is really the only protection 
RSADSI has right now.

The code I saw posted was  devoid of comments.  Not quite what I'd expect
from a software company- but maybe that's why they're hollering trade
secret so loud.

I was taught that a strong cryptosystem was one where you could give
someone the algorithm and the encrypded data and walk away laughing.  Their
claims that release of a possible source for the algorithm compromise its
security don't ring true.

I'll go a step further (and a step back):  if someone *signed* a secrecy
agreement to get the algorhythm, and then revealed it, there was a trade
secret violation.  Whether or not there was a copyright violation depends
on if the person copied the idea of the algorithm (no copyright
infringement) or the expression (possible copyright infringement).

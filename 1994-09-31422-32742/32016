Calculating discrete logs in Z/pZ is "easy" if p-1 is smooth
(and p is prime).

Factoring N=pq is "easy" if p-1 is smooth.

Apparently lots of experts believe that the difficulty of the
discrete log problem is intimately connected with the difficulty
of factoring.  [It seems to be true historically, at least.]

Factoring N=pq is also apparently "easy" if p+1 is smooth.
[Though I'm still looking for a description/reference to this.
Actually I remember hearing a generalization: if phi(x) is a
cyclotomic polynomial, and if phi(p) is smooth, then N=pq is
"easy" to factor.  Can anyone point me to this result, or tell
me whether I'm misremembering?]

Anyways, the main question that I was rambling towards: is
the discrete log problem easy in Z/pZ if p+1 is smooth?

This seems like an interesting question to me.  It gives some
further insight into the analogy between factoring and discrete
logs.  Moreover, if true, it might (?) also mean that choosing p
so that (p-1)/2 is prime (or has a very large factor) is not
sufficient to ensure that discrete logs are difficult in Z/pZ.

Thanks for the information!

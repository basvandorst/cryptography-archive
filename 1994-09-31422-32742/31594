I am writing a program to encrpyt files and hide them in sounds.  I have 
a working verion using IDEA and tripple DES.  Some people I know don't 
think that this is a high enough level of security (don't ask me why), so 
I though I should throw in one more to make them happy.  :)  The past few 
days I have seen posts on Blowfish, and would like to use it in my 
program.  Can someone please tell me where I can find a copy of the 
source in C, and if I can legally use it in my freeware program?

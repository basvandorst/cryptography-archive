*Double sigh*

Copyright is irrelevant if you can't stop an infringer.  Before you can
bring a action for infringement of copyright (with some Berne Convention
exceptions) you have to register (17 USCS 411(a)) prior to bringing action
in U.S. court for copyright infringement.

By the time a someone resorts to court action for copyright infringement,
his claim to trade secret protection is pretty much gone.

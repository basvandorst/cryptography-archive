   Very confused.  First of all, the organization responsible for
decrypting PURPLE messages was OP20-G, a Navy "desk."  So the State
Department couldn't possibly keep it from the Navy...  In fact, there
were very few people in State in the know.  (By the way, MAGIC was the
cover term for PURPLE, Ultra, and several other top level intercepts.
PURPLE was the Japanese diplomatic code machine also used
occaisionally by the Japanese Navy.  The Japanese Navy usually relied
on a series of codes--not ciphers, but they used superencipherments--
changed every six months for their top level messages, but they were
changed on December 1, 1941, not December 31...)

    The story does come close to an OSS operation against a German
Consul (in Portugal I think), but the codes involved were lower level
codes, not Ultra.  ("Wild Bill" Donovan deserved his nickname.)  But
to be fair, after a few episodes like this the OSS did co-ordinate
such operations with the appropriate crypto people beforehand.

Far be it for me to defend Mr. Sternlight _BUT_ I think he has a point here.
In a scenario like the one above (and I think it _is_ a good analogy to the
question of the RC4 code posted here being RSA's), it could be construed that
if "B" says the formula is in fact the real forumla, he has disclosed what
the formula is even though he didn't originally post by giving definite
information about what the formula _is_ (what "A" posted).  However, if "B"
were to say that the formula is _not_ the original formula (assuming it isn't,
of course) he hasn't disclosed anything about the formula itself, only about
what the formula "A" posted _is_ (not the original).  He hasn't disclosed any
specific information about the formula he is guarding.  Enough such answers
("no, it isn't that") could yeild actual specific information about the
formula but no single such answer could.  (If you're curious, get and read
some info on so-called "zero-knowledge proofs")  I think a single confirmation
that the formula is real could be actionable, but a single denial probably
could not be.

Where the analogy breaks down is that the actual question here is not about
RC4's "formula" (the RC4 altorithm), but about how it's presented (the actual
code).  I think that my thoughts about confirmation vs. denial are still valid
when applied to confirmation vs. denial of the code posted.  There may be a
gray area about confirmation vs. denial of the algorithm itself.
Of course, I'm trying to apply logic to an interpretation of the law and we
know what kind of problems _that_ can cause......

It looks as if the initial circuit proposed for this ciruit would
not pass any NSA certifications for truly random number generation.
Even if the resistors are matched, the circuit is very succeptible to
non-random noise from RF, temerature variation, humitidy variation, etc.
It would be very difficult to keep this thing on the edge which would
be necessary for "true thermal variation" unless all the resistors
were really close on the same die, and shielded.

Take a look at the AC component of a broken-down Zener diode or the jitter
from a ring oscillator for better source of randomness.

Now, as far as randomness and compression goes, I would say that
although "compressible" strings will be found within random number
sequences, that the information necessary to indicate that information
in a bit stream is compressed would, in the long run, undo the effects
of any compression (in a stream which passes all of our "truly random"
tests).  I'd be interested a proof one way or the other from someone
who has the know-how and time.

   I thought NewDES was an entirely different cipher than DES!  NewDES
was proposed later on, and had 120 bit keys of something....

   Diffrential and linear attacks don't generally get much harder with
completely random, independent round subkeys than with the subkeys generated
from a shorter (ie 56 bit) key.  These attacks work by trying to recover
bits of the indivudual round subkeys.
 
   Independent keys for each roudn won't make differential attacks easier,
they'll make them a little harder.  They'll make other attacks harder
if those attacks depentd on the key schedule.  They'll always make key
search attacks harder.
 
   I think Biham also showed that DES' key schedule is resistant to
"related-key" attacks, which are attacks that use a fixed rule for
changing keys, and get chosen plaintexts under many different keys
to learn on e of the keys.

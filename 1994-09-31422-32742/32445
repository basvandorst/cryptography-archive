The UTSA and the California Trade Secrets Act both provide that if YOU can
be PRESUMED to know the thing you had was a trade secret obtained by theft
or violation of a duty of secrecy BY ANOTHER, and YOU perform the prohibited
acts (disclosure without permission, etc.) YOU are guilty of
misappropriation. The California law provides criminal penalties, including
jail time. Have you read it? The language was posted by Grady Ward many
messages ago.

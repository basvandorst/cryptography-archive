There is a public-domain package which does blind signatures, but it suffers
from patent entanglements.  It is the "magic money" program which uses
Chaum/Fiat/Naor blind signatures for an experimental digital cash system.
Although it is couched in financial terms, the actual signature mechanism
is pretty general and the code could probably be easily modified or used
outright.

However, the RSA algorithm is patented, and I believe Chaum's blind
signatures are patented as well (patent number 4759063 among others).
RSA has released a library called RSAREF for free non-commercial use of
the RSA algorithm, but I don't know whether it yet gives you access to
the low-level RSA encryption and decryption routines that would be
needed for implementing blind signatures.  Then you should really
contact Chaum and get his permission as well.  So any actual
implementation of RSA-type blind signatures has some pretty hefty legal
hurdles to get over before it can be widely and legitimately used.

Magic money can be found by ftp to ftp.csn.net, cd to /mpj, and read the
README files for how to get the package if you can do so legally.

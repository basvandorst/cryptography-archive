Depending on the inputs you use, sometimes they'll produce grammatically
correct stuff that any human reading it will recognize as bogus - 
After all, syntax is not semantics...  On the other hand, non-human
readers such as the NSA's automagic eavesdropping may let them pass :-)

On a related note, I see that Tommy the Tourist (the anonymous
remailer at csua.berkeley.edu) is now using full-sentence random NSA-bait 
at the end of remailed postings instead of the old random words.

Given that, which is what I thought, I chose to create an informal (with
respect to the Big 7 newgroup rules) process here. If there is mostly
opposition to the idea, I'll recede from it without making a gantza megillah
out of it. If there is significant support, I'll press the issue.

So far, the responses have been somewhat in favor of keeping the original
charter and creating a new group for legal crypto issues, but the time I
suggested for comments has some way to run, and then there's the vote. Given
I'm not going to use the Big 7 mechanism, if it appears a vote is indicated,
I'm going to suggest it be done it public to avoid any suggestion that I'm
secretly "cooking" the count.

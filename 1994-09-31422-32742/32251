Interesting that they write off the *whole* internet as
"anti-capitalist bozos."  It's pretty big, and there are all
kinds of people using it.  I must wonder, though, that if this
is their attitude, why they would not just ignore the internet?
Why post their "warning" (a pretty serious matter, seems to me)
via a third party?  Evidently they "bothered" to do that, or so
their stooge^H^H^H^H^H^H spokesman claims.  Something still
seems cowar^H^H^H^H^H off-kilter about this behavior to me.

BTW anyone who wants to bug RSADSI can discover their e-mail
addresses easily enough.  A direct posting of this "warning"
would not, it seems to me, amount to some substantial inducement
to harass them (more than it was anyway).

BBTW I may well be a "bozo" but if you think I am
"anti-capitalist" you are off by a LONG shot!  I don't tend to
think that lawyers living off the ingenuity of *others* is
exemplary capitalism, however.  RSARDI does not need to worry
about any flames from *this* bozo.  Life's too short, and as you
said:

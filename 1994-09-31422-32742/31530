Previous threads focused on the possible mathematical weaknesses in PGP 
and RSA  and whether they exist and how serious they were etc.
I see alot of these arguments though as academic. If someone wanted
to break your encryption, they could find out where your computer is,
break in, steal it (possibly undetected), work on the pass phrase (which
is probably several orders of magnitude easier than a 1024 bit key) and
take it from there.  This would proably be cheaper than breaking the 
system as well. 
Am I wrong ?

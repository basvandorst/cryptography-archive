: I wonder if the NSA offers apprenticeships?  :-)

: Well, they do have student co-ops which seem to be a

: usual background check of course, and that takes quite
: a while, like six or nine months.


Or if you have an MS in math or computer science, you could 
simply apply.  You must have a squeeky clean background though.
The background check frequently takes longer than nine months, 
particluarly if you have moved around a great deal.  There are
also some immediate disqualifiers such as mental instability, 
a history of frequent illegal drug use, relatives or other 
connections to certain foreign countries, etc. you get the idea.

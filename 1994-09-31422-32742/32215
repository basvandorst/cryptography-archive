I would imagine yes.   Suppose I have a bootleg videotape made
in some offshore jurisdiction that is not party to copyright laws.
It would still be illegal for me to sell or profit from or copy
that videotape in California.

Were this not the case, it would be trivial to legalize
all bottlegging by cycling the stuff through a suitable
offshore site.

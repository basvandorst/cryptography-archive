You are taking my remark out of context. Of course you keep your copyright.
But Unruh was attempting to argue that if he posted a message, he could
place conditions on the reader of the message in the newsgroup he posted it
to. I was responding by saying he had no property rights with respect to the
original reader himself such that he could impose ancillary conditions on
that original reader's reading once he posted the message.

He was arguing that one could post a message and say that "it is a
condition of your reading this message that you whistle Dixie and stand on
your head". My point was that having posted the message to a newsgroup, he
couldn't impose such conditions on the readers. That he had a copyright
deals with some specific behaviors, such as republication without
permission, not all behaviors. What's more, the behaviors it deals with
aren't imposed by Unruh, but by copyright law. He can waive them, but he
cannot impose any not already in the law. Thus his analogy between a
copyright message, and trade secret software, fails. In the case of the
message there is no general property right--only the rights provided under
copyright law.

Summarizing, I was distinguishing "property right" from "copyright". His
message is copyright, but not property (in the sense of property and
contracts law). It is also no longer a trade secret if he, himself posts it
to a public newsgroup (assuming it ever was a trade secret).

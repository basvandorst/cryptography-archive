Wrong, wrong, wrong.

The law creates a _presumption_ that, under certain circumstances, your
information is secret.

All this means is that the other side gets the burden of producing
contrary evidence. (Note that, under current doctrine, any evidence at
all is infinitely more persuasive than a mere presumption. Once the
other side has produced rebutting evidence, the presumption is
completely irrelevant.)

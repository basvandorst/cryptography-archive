[rest of this neato idea elided]

If the system is using "truly" random numbers, generated in one or
more of the ways we've been talking about here (zener diodes, alpha
particles, other noise sources, etc.), then of course the key must be
stored for both parties to use. If Alice encrypts, Bob had better hav
the OTP bits if he wants to to the decryption. Hence the issues of
CD-ROM vs. DAT vs. other storage.

If, however, the system proposed is _algorithmically_ (and
_deterministically_) generating the bits, then it's just a cipher. It
may be a pretty good cipher, but a cipher nonetheless.

(In this system, Alice and Bob are relying on computing the "virtual
one time pad" from...from what? From a key, presumably. Hence, a
conventional cipher. All of the "information-theoretically secure"
advantages of the OTP are thus lost.)

Not to sound catty, since I don't want to insult cats, but the last
few "amazing ideas" about one time pads--the company that "makes your
one time pads for you the easy way" and this post--are making me
reconsider my vote against sci.crypt.moderated.

Since you, not I assert the conversation was with you, your assertion does
the job if your hypothesis is accurate.

As to the substance, I would think it depends on what the notice on the
outside of the box says, and how prominently. Or are you asserting that no
matter what the box says, if you take money for it, it must be a sale? If
that is your assertion, I'd be interested in your authority for such a
notion.

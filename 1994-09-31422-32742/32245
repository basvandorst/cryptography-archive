FWB: Consider also that some of us believe the US constitution obligates us
to keep and bear arms.  The Feds, through their idiotic software exportation
laws, are kind enough to *remind* us that encryption *software* is a
*munition* too.  Since US citizens have an obligation to maintain munitions,
we should own and understand both firearms and cryptware.

Exactly.  Just as you and the person you're communicating with have access to  
the net's info, so does anyone trying to read your mail.  Your system is not  
really a one-time pad because the 'pad' is not truly random.  Given that the  
attacker knows your algorithm, your system is only as secure as the information  
you have secretly shared with your co-conspirator.  In essence, it is a  
password.

Granted, it is not exactly subject cracking like a UNIX password is, but it  
does severely limit the possible number of keys you can use:

Let's see here, we'll start with the headers of a few standard file formats:
ZIP, GZ, HQX, WP, ... (ad nauseum) and try to decrypt the first few bytes of  
the encrypted file.  When we get a little plaintext, we can suddenly eliminate  
90% of the files on the net.  Then we move on...

The beauty of a one-time pad is that it is truly random.  You're killing that  
randomness by saying 'let's pick our pad from this particular set of files'.   
Hmmm...

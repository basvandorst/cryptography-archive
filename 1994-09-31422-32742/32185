If you have been taught that the only way to modify a program is via
modifying source code and recompiling or reassembling, your computer science
educators have been derelict. If you have been taught that the only way to
find out where the object code you wish to modify is located in the overall
program is if you have the source code, your educators have been similarly
derelict. (I blame your educators out of politeness to you unless, of
course, you were self-educated.)

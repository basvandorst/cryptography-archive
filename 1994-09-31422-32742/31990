This probably would not work, primarily because there is no 
clearly-defined "location" for a character on a music CD.
The CD spec allows the beginning of records (or tracks) to
vary by +/- several dozens of bits relative to any
index marks.  (And this assumes you're able to unscramble
the convolutional interleaving in a consistent way to
*get* to an index mark.)

A secondary problem is that the CD spec allows a certain number
of character-errors, which would corrupt your data.  A third
problem is that different pressings of the same CD will have
different digital codes -- indeed, european CD's often use the 4
dB gain-range bit in each block, while American CD's do not; this
would completely change your data.  Plus the CD may have been
re-cut... so it is more than "knowing which album to use".

A data format, such as a software distribution on CD-ROM,
floppy, or tape would work better... you could use as
your "book" the largest binary file on the media ... but I would 
still be worried about "versioning" problems, even
between media that look identical from the package.

    I haven't forgotten it, but do you have anything better to use?
Even neglecting the possibility of quantum computers, any reasonable
RSA keysize today will likely be breakable in say, thirty years.  But
Bussard ramjets and room-temperature superconductors have
theoretically been possible for thirty years, and I don't see either
happening soon.

    In any case, no I don't recommend using RSA for secrets which must
remain secret for more than twenty years.  But there is no other
system, with the possible exception of one-time pads done right, that
I would trust longer than that.

    Also I have a strong hunch that factoring in quantum computers
does provide an "acid test" between various interpretations of quantum
mechanics.  As I understand it, quantum computers depend strongly on
which interpretation is correct. (Or should I say interpretations,
there are some which could coexist.)

This is the first message from David where I agree with *some* of
his logic.

Here though, I must disagree.  How in the world can you say that the
Capstone system is secure!  I am assuming that you don't know the
details of tha algorithm and are placing your blind trust in a statement
issued to make the public *feel* secure.
Perhaps I am mistaken in my underastanding that Capstone uses the secret
Skipjack algorithm.

How secure is 1024-bit RSA ? 
Initial reports indicate that the latest release of MIT's PGP can
handle 2048-bit keys, but won't let you generate a key over 1024-bits
thus forcing people to use one of the modified versions to generate
their 2048-bit keys.

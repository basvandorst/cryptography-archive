That's a pretty good summary, to which I'd add that the California law, and
I think the Uniform Trade Secrets Act also provides, in effect, that if the
reverse engineer could be presumed to know that somebody else breached the
contract or stole the material, then the reverse engineer himself is guilty
of misappropriation of the trade secret if he publishes his reverse
engineering or uses it.

Given the logic of the situation, I think if RSADSI can prove their
assertions about the way in which the program is distributed, it would be
possible to make the case that someone HAD TO have stolen or violated, and
thus the reverse engineer CAN be presumed to know this even if he wasn't the
original thief or violator of a duty to secrcy.

That's assuming, of course that the published code was reverse engineered
rather than being the original code distributed by RSADSI under safeguards.
If the latter, there's at least an open and shut copyright case, in addition
to the possible trade secrets case.

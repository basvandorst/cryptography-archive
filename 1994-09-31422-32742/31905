Really?

Backtrack the thread and tell me why.  The mere fact that some
data _may_ be encrypted hardly makes an interesting crypto
problem.  A problem/puzzle maybe... I wouldn't know.

(Btw, note that the original poster infers and extrapolates
 from just two data points. I like that kind of 'science'...)

On the other hand, cracking encrypted information may be more 
than just a puzzle in Norway.  You may also be breaking Section
145 of the Penal Code.  The lawmakers compared unauthorized
codebreaking to opening other peoples mail.  You may of course
state that you only want to test the odd security system...
(OK, please don't reopen that discussion in this group.)

Actually, not. As in many cases, the law defines what "secret" means in this
case, not the dictionary. And the law says: "a trade secret shall be
presumed to be secret when the OWNER THEREOF takes measures to prevent it
from becoming available...." Thus that someone else violated the law doesn't
change the definition "secret", above, and thus the rest of the matter
referring to the "secret" and the consequences of violation still applies.

I know it's counter-intuitive, but that's the way the law often works. In
addition it explains why so many amateurs who try to figure out what the law
means here on the internet are both dogmatic and wrong. They are SURE that
if it is logical or intuitive, that's what the law must say. Not
necessarily. At the end of the day it is those who have read the language,
and not those who are "reasoning" from circumstances rather than the
language, who must prevail.

Nope. See above.

NOT.

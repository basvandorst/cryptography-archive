   According to various people I have spoken with, RSA Data Security Inc has
   no control over anybody who uses RC4, unless they use copyrighted code
   or have previously signed a license or non-disclosure agreement.  You may
   want to check this with your lawyer, but it seems that all their sabre
   rattling is nothing but a front.

   I think the smartest thing RSA Data Security, Inc could do at this point
   is to patent RC4.  They lose the secrecy, but still maintain their
   financial interests.  And then they can publish all of the cryptanalysis
   they have done.

They do not maintain their financial interests in jurisdictions where
prior publication invalidates patenting.

The rc4 code as published on sci.crypt is now available for anon-ftp
on ftp.ox.ac.uk

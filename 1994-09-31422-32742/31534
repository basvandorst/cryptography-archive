An important property of one-way hash functions is that every bit in
the hash can be affected by every bit in the message.  So if you
change one bit in the message then each bit in the hash has a 50%
chance of being flipped.

This does not apply to the one-round Life hash.  Each cell in Life is
determined by the previous state of the 8 cells around it.  So if you
change a single bit in the message then you will change a maximum of 9
bits in the hash.

If the edges of the Life world wrap around then the minimum number of
Life-cycles necessary to fulfil this property would be half the length
of the longest side on the grid.  This would allow the effect of a
single-bit change to propogate to every part of the grid.

As for the tendency of some patterns to die out, I would suggest the
use of a "parity" rule, so that a cell is set to "live" if the
surrounding 8 cells have an odd number of "live" ones.  Its not quite
Life as we know it, but its more likely to be secure.  Anything else
is not going to be very random.  "Too many zeros" is only one kind of
non-randomness.

I suspect that this is going to be a fairly expensive one-way hash
compared to things like MD5.

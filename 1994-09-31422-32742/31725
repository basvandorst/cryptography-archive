With your WAG you hit the bull's eye - trouble is, it was someone elses'
target.  The program does use BASIC RANDOMIZE/RND but only to permutate
or shuffle a list of the 256 characters from 00hex to FFhex - a function
that it does very well.

I was probably reading books on cryptography long before you were born.
I have my own personal copy of Applied Cryptography - do you?

You finally got one right - your WAG is completely off.  Sometimes it is
worth spending a little money to insure that you aren't making a fool of
yourself.  An encryption program based on fractals?  You should have used
KISS BASIC.
 
PS: My spell-checker doesn't like your cutesy spelling.

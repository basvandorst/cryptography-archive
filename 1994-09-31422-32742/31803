: I hope this is the right group for this.

: Does anybody have a list of available secure SPOMs?  I know there is a
: derivative of 68hcxx11 microcontroller, is there anything else out
: there?

: Background: secure SPOMs are one way of ensuring hardware security in
: encryption systems.  The secret key as well as the algorithm to
: encrypt/decrypt messages are programmed on the SPOM.  Once the
: programming is done, some fuse is blown (or some other process) to
: ensure that the secret key and the program cannot be
: accessed/duplicated.  The only operations available to the rest of the
: system is to request encryption/decryption services of the CPU.

: A related question: is there any other way to achieve the same result.

: Any help will be appreciated.

Try using a PIC-series CPU or the 68HC705P (compatible to 68xxx).
They have a security fuse. After it is blown out, the PIC just reports
the value of the XORed-Nibbles of the instructions (12 bit), so you
can check the programming, but not reconstruct it.
I heard from some guys that say to be able to read them. They use some
kind of mask to mask out just the protection fuse and the use UV to
reset it (EPROM-Version!). But they also need around 5 tries and maybe
they won`t get the whole code in one part.

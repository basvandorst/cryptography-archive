Consider the following: "A" posts the formula for Coca Cola, asserting that
it is just that. We don't know how "A" got what he posted, and we don't know
if it is the real formula or not.

"B", who knows the formula for Coca Cola, and is under non-disclosure, says
that the formula "A" posted is, in fact the real formula and that the reason
he knows that is that he has the real formula. It is known that "B" signed
the usual non-disclosure agreement, and it is known that the real formula
for Coca Cola is a trade secret.

Question: Has "B" done anything actionable at law?

   I think PGP encrypts one copy of the session key with each
recipient's public key.  *If* PGP pads the session keys differently
for each recipients, then the attack won't work, because the messages
encrypted under the different keys won't be the same message.  If it
pads each session key the same way, then I think this attack may work.

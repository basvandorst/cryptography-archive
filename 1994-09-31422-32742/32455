This has nothing to do with the science of cryptography, Sternlight.

Why? What if Lotus Notes was compiled with extensive debugging 
information---enough for a reverse engineer to recover the original
source code? What if some RC4 product is actually distributed as source
code? What if the reverse engineer has looked at other RSADSI source 
code and made reasonable guesses as to variable names and indentation?

RSA's just crying over spilled milk...  I'm very pleased some of their 
precious source is available for public scrutiny.  No crytosystem worth 
using should be available in binary form only, not that this ever stopped 
disassemblers.  I for one cannot understand how these greedy fucks were 
granted such a broad patent....  unless it were expedient for the 
government to control the outlet of such technologies.

Munitions export laws indeed.  This is all such crap.  How is it that we 
can consider the "argument" of how secure cryptosystems constitute 
"munitions" and should be kept out of the hands of citizens to be even a 
lamb's hair above insane???!

If I were you, I'd be a bit cautious about dispensing legal advice
unless you are actually a lawyer specializing in the intellectual
property area.

If I were a juror, it might be possible to convince me that someone with
privileged access to a trade secret would be violating an NDA by
confirming that a published item actually *is* the trade secret.

Analogy: someone posts a "Just Like Betty Crocker's German Chocolate
Cake" recipe in the cooking section of the local newspaper. A reader
who once worked for Betty Crocker and had access to Betty Crocker's
recipe writes a letter to the food editor informing them that the recipe
actually *is* the Betty Crocker recipe. Before that revelation, it was
just a recipe that produced a cake that tasted a lot like the one from
the Betty Crocker mix. After the revelation, you know a trade secret.
You can now go to your local black market bakery and begin flooding
the market with counterfeit Betty Crocker German Chocolate Cake mix
and become fabulously wealthy. (Betty Crocker is almost certainly
someone's trade mark - your guess is as good as mine.)

Before anyone jumps on me for offering a defective analogy - testing
crypto code can be done a whole lot more precisely than cake tasting and
equivalent output over a sufficient spectrum of input is essentially
proof of identity (we need not apply the cake analogy to this part, I
think :-) - let me remind you that the issue would be the
monetary loss suffered by the owner of the trade secret, in this case
RSADSI. If I want to sell a software package and assert in my advertising
that the encryption is compatible with RC4, I have to worry a little
bit about whether or not I have it right and if not, how badly I'm
going to get sued. Maybe it's cheaper to pay RSADSI for the real thing.
If I *know* that the posted RC4 is in fact the real thing thanks to 
ssatchell@BIX.com doing a source code comparison for me, I can use
it without having to pay any sort of royalty to RSADSI (legally, in
all probability - but don't take my word for it :-). RSADSI has therefore
suffered a monetary loss and has a legal right to compensation.

Does a trade secret cease to be a trade secret when something is
published which is *asserted* to be that secret or when a person
with privileged knowledge of the secret *confirms* that the published
item actually is the secret? I wouldn't want to bet my house on a
judge or jury rejecting the latter case.

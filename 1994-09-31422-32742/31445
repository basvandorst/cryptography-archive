   32-bit unsigned integers {probably aren't too efficient if your
compiler thinks in terms of 16-bit integers being the mative word
size.  This is probably the problem as far as performance goes.
The algorithm looks like it should be able to be really {fast,
if implemented {right, even with 16 rounds.

   Wasn't ULTRA the British group that broke Enigma (with the help of some 
   Poles who got a copy of the machine... and used a special purpose 
   computer to crack the rotor set up on encrypted messages)?

ULTRA was the British code name for all very high grade intelligence
in WW2.  Although a substantial portion of ULTRA was derived from
reading Enigma traffic, not all of it came from that source.  For
instance, the various "Fish" ciphers (another code word) generated
ULTRA but were not Enigma traffic.  I believe (perhaps someone could
confirm or deny) that not all ULTRA was the result of cryptanalysis.
Some was the results of good old fashioned spying.

   I don't think there were any German "ultra" messages (enigma messages) 
   and Ultra was not a US project.

The US was introduced to ULTRA during the war, when teams crossed the
Atlantic to work with each other's intelligence organizations and
ULTRA material was released to US commanders with a need to know.
PURPLE came over to England (and British forces in Asia) from about
the same time.  I found it interesting that the word "Ultra" appears
in Kahn's 1967 _The CodeBreakers_, even though the word was still a
tightly kept secret in the UK.  Not until 1974 was the true meaning of
ULTRA publically revealed.

Is it really any different than PGP? Is not RC4 now in the PUBLIC DOMAIN,
as DEFINED by ITAR? Maybe the following helps?

Philip Dubois, Esq.
Attorney for Philip R. Zimmermann
2305 Broadway
Boulder, CO  80304

Dear Sir,

In response to what I've read in cyberspace, viz., Hugh Miller's
soliciting contributions to a legal defense fund for Phil Zimmer-
mann to be sent to you as Phil's attorney, I want to help.  What
I have to give is an idea.

Phil doesn't need a legal DEFENSE fund.  His situation cries out
for legal OFFENSE fortitude.  Don't circle the wagons, mount your
steeds.

Zealous advocacy, the professional responsibility borne by those
of us who represent clients in legal forums, strongly suggests a
pre-emptive strike.  Why wait for the government?  Sue the bas-
tards.

Unless they've repealed Rule 57 while we slept, file a
declaratory judgment action and do so with all deliberate speed. 
It's Zimmermann vs. U.S. Customs Service & Office of Munitions
Control.

Declaratory judgments, Wright and Miller tell us, "play an impor-
tant part in litigation of constitutional issues and other issues
of public law."  You could even get a jury trial on it.

What's the case or controversy?  In a nutshell, you've got the
feds molesting Zimmermann, his outlets, and his communications
channels because they think he exported a defense article on the
State Department's Munitions List in violation of the Inter-
national Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)(22 CFR 121- 130).  

What's the article?  Auxiliary military equipment in the form of
cryptographic software (22 CFR 121.1).

What's software?  Information on the operation of computers 
(Webster).

What's "public domain"?  Information published and available at
bookstores, through subscription, and in public libraries (22 CFR
120.18).

What exports on the Munitions List are NOT subject to the
controls of ITAR?  Information which is in the "public domain"
(22 CFR 125.1(a)).

Here's my library card!

I would hope that in view of my suggested approach, one might
look at a "defense" fund for Phil in the same way Robert Harper
did in his toast to John Marshall, the later Chief Justice of the
United States, "Millions for defense, but not one cent for
tribute."  Giant gonads to the fore!

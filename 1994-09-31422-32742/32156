I realize that this is a FAQ, but the journal reference given in the FAQL
is not easy to find around here.  Can somebody abstract what is know about
the algorithm for me, or point me to an online description or more
'eclectic' literature reference?  Post or E-mail would be fine.  Thanks in
advance.

I've been using pkzip/zip to encrypt files on a UNIX workstation
and decrypt them on DOS, and visa versa.  Perhaps someone can enlighten
me with a more secure algorithm that is portable, but here's my main
question: 

	Where can I can technical documentation on the encryption
    algorithm used in PKZIP?  

Some docs have directed me to "appnotes.txt," which supposedly comes
with the PKZIP package - but I haven't seen it in any of several
releases.  Please help me out - the security types at my company want
tech docs on this algorithm.

You can post or e-mail...  Thanks!

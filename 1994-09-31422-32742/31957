I have recently forgotten the password I protected several word 6.0
documents with. Two of these , including my resume, have become very
necessary. Has anyone made any progress towards developing a tool
to remove this type of protection. PLEASE HELP!!!!!!!!

Also I was wondering if anyone knew if it were possible to slot in
a different encryption engine such as pgp (which I am now using) into
Word? Any and all responses will be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance!

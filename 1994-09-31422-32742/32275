The burden of proof is on Bidzos, not us. Why don't you ask *HIM* how
he knows that every copy of it is licensed.

Asserting that Bidzos is some oracle of truth is spreading FUD, too.

: You haven't been following this discussion. Jim says that all copies are

So Bizdos doesn't need any evidence to support his arguments, but
everyone *ELSE* on the internet (with the miraculous exception of
YOU), does?

The best I can do is my unpublished conjectured attack:

If the ciphertext is many times longer than the _product_ of the 
key lengths, then columns of the initial block will occupy many
lines of the intermediate block. Call the typical number of lines
occupied L. Many substrings of length L or less in the ciphertext
thus represent pieces of columns, including only every LK[1]-th
character, where LK[j] is the length of the j-th key. It should
be possible with lots of ciphertext to match up n-tuples of
these strings by adding up log conditional n-gram frequencies
and using the n-tuples with the best scores. This attack is
polynomial order, but I think from rough attempts to use information
theory that a _lot_ of material might be needed. The same attack
works on single incomplete columnar transposition very well if
the ciphertext is about twice as long as in a usual puzzle, i.e.,
I want about 400 letters for a key 7 to 12 characters long. For
double transposition I conjecture that 5000 characters (!) should
be enough. Good luck.

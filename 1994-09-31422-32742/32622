I think it is more accurate to say that the UTSA and the California Trade
Secrets Act both provide that if YOU can be presumed to KNOW the thing
you had was a trade secret obtained by theft or violation of a duty of
secrecy by another ...

Not "presumed to suspect" or "presumed to guess that there was a chance"
but "presumed to *know*".

I'm not Bidzos' "mouthpiece," but I've found that if I send him e-mail
asking him about something of general interest, his replies will
sometimes say something to the effect, "Pass this on if you like."

Which I've done on a couple of occasions. Most recently over the
report that an NSA agent threatened to have Bidzos run over in his
parking lot.

David Sternlight's posts give all indication of being similar to this,
i.e., contacting Bidzos by e-mail, and getting a response back with
the "Pass this on if you like" comment added.

(As to why many corporate people don't participate on a regular basis
on Usenet...who knows? Neither Bill Gates nor Andy Grove participates
in public forums, after all. Different modes of operation. "Why aren't
they more like us?" is rarely a productive question.)

Paranoia can be fun, but which version is it: is Sternlight working
for the NSA, which may want to off Bidzos, or for Bidzos, or what? The
Occam's Razor conclusion is clear: Sternlight is just another
interested citizen who spends a lot of time on the Net, as many of us
do, but whose political and moral philosophy is different from that of
some--or even most--of us. Big deal. I used to chuckle when I read the
speculations about Sternlight working for the NSA, or for Bidzos, or
for both, but now I'm beginning to think some folks are taking this as
an item of commonly accepted truth.

Look, I don't demonize Bidzos, nor do I support him on all or even
most things surrounding the RSA business. I did buy a "MailSafe"
license several years back, before PGP made public key crypto so
popular, but I also use MacPGP (and not even the 2.6 version, which I
haven't yet gotten). I'm of the opinion, and have told Bidzos this,
that the popularity of PGP and the whole culture surrounding it will
do more to help his real business interests than anything else that
ever could have happened. 

I helped to found the Cypherpunks group and mailing list, which ought
to tell you I'm not a lapdog of Bidzos (by the way, Bidzos attended
our emergency meeting on Clipper, in April, 1993, and was politely
received). Agreement with Bidzos on some issue, with ZImmermann on
some other issue, with Grady Ward on yet another issue, and with David
Sternlight on still other issues...what's wrong with that?

Lastly, I had nothing to do with the posting of the alleged RC4 code,
nor do I have any strong opinions about whether it was a trade secret,
is now a stolen item, violates ITAR, etc. (So don't send me
subpoenas!)

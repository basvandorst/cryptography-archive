I don't think this will immunize you. They speak of "trade secrets, in the
form of" code. This doesn't mean the trade secrets are ONLY in the form of
that code, and thus if you use the code to recode, you are still attacking
the underlying trade secrets and haven't protected yourself. Note the comma
in the above quote.

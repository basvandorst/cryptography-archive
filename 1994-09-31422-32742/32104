Thanks for posting the text of the code. It seems pretty conclusive that
there was a violation. Since RSADSI asserts that every copy is covered by a
"no reverse engineering" agreement, either theft or breach of a duty to
maintain secrecy must have been involved, and thus improper means must have
been used.

This means that:
   (b) "Misappropriation" means:

  (1) Acquisition of a trade secret of another by a person who
knows or has reason to know that the trade secret was acquired
by improper means; or
   (2) Disclosure or use of a trade secret of another without
express or implied consent by a person who:
   (A) Used improper means to acquire knowledge of the trade
secret; or
   (B) At the time of disclosure or use, knew or had reason to
know that his or her knowledge of the trade secret was:
   (i) Derived from or through a person who had utilized
improper means to acquire it;

means that under b1, b2, and b2bi,  ANYONE republishing the trade secret is
guilty of misappropriation if they meet the conditions of b2bi.

At least as of the time RSADSI published their notice, everyone who read it
(and everyone who reads this message) has reason to know that the trade
secret was acquired by improper means, I would think. What's more, depending
on the language associated with the original mailing list publication, and
the newsgroup publication, said language itself might have contained enough
information to give reason to know the trade secret was acquired by improper
means.

Be VERY careful, folks.

Proved by Rosser & Schoenfeld. Someone else pointed out x > 17 suffices.

:(Sorry my original follow up got corrupted, here is a corrected version)
:As far as I can remember from my copy of "A dictionary of curious and
:interesting numbers" x/ln(x) - pi(x) changes sign an _infinite_ number
:of times the first being at (or before) Skewes number whose value
:was given as 10^(10^134)
 
You memory or dictionary is faulty. pi(x) > x/log x for x > 17.
You are confusing x/log x with li(x). It is indeed true that 
li(x) - pi(x) changes sign infinitely often. The estimate for the 
first cross over has come way down. It is now around 10^370.

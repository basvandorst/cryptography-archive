Nothing that lawyers do shocks me any more, but the above is a bizarre 
idea. 

1) If someone files a patent, they get a temporary monopoly, but if
they have a trade secret get out of the bag, they get a permanent
monopoly?  If the monopoly is not permanent, when does it run out?

2) If I remember the Pentagon Papers trial (NY Times vs. US, 1972 or so)
correctly, the Supreme Court ruled that the NY Times could publish the
Pentagon Papers because a very tough standard of clear and present
danger had not been met.  The Pentagon guy who had leaked the papers got
in trouble, but that was not the NYT's problem and the NYT's first
amendment rights were not affected even though they knew perfectly
well where the documents came from.

Logic suggests that we sci.crypt readers wanting to repost RC4 are at
worst in the same situation that the NYT was in.  So you're proposing
that our legal system safeguards disclosing the contents of
publications available in thousands of retail stores more
zealously than it safeguards disclosing top secret military documents.
Thus, a shrink wrap license is a stronger way to enforce secrecy
than a national security classification.

I guess anything is possible, but I would like to see some legal
citations that indicate you're not making this all up.

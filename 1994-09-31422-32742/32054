Two rhetorical questions, one deriving from the other!  A truly
semantically intricate construction.

To be serious -- no, the analogy does not hold for two reasons.  

First, so-called 'intellectual property' is a government-granted
monopoly and is not the same as tangible property.  The US constitution
has a specific clause granting Congress the power to give monopolies to
inventors and authors.  Yet where it addresses tangible property, the
only thing it has to say is what the government can't do:  take private
property for public use without just compensation, or search or
seize it unreasonably or without probable cause.

The distinction is clear:  The integrity of ownership of tangible
property is clearly the default state unless government misbehaves;
and the non-ownership of so-called intellectual property is clearly the
default state unless government takes special action (or misbehaves, as
in the case of certain silly patents).

Second, the application of law does not arise out of analogies.  For
example, killing a package store cashier is in some ways analogous to
playing a video game (you point and shoot) but it doesn't mean that the
second is illegal.

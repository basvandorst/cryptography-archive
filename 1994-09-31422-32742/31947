The phone card chip is a simple 256 bit serial EPROM with no attached
processor of any sort.  The security fuse keeps the first 96 bits from
being written after factory programming.  The remaining 160 bits show
how many phone-call units have been spent (the phone marks off these
bits one at a time).  The phone card chip makes no attempt to keep any
of its contents or access methods confidential.  Its security does not
depend on this.  That is why the idea that you can rip the system off
by knowing how the checksums/signatures are computed is silly.

Some crackers in fact have managed to beat the system (workable
methods are fairly obvious) but apparently it is not a serious enough
economic problem for the phone companies to justify the cost of a more
secure system.  A criminal with the resources and motivation to make
and distribute massive numbers of counterfeit phone cards would
probably pick something more profitable to do, like printing
counterfeit money.

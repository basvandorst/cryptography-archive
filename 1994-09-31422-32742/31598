Tom Clancy, in The Cardinal of the Kermlin, described a system that
used something akin to WORM drives with random weather satellite data 
that were destroyed as they were read (too many watts in the read beam?).

I imagine that a smart WORM drive wouldn't be too hard to design -- you 
could even do it with standard drives today.  Just burn over the old tracks
three or four times with a psuedo-random pattern.  The nice side of this 
idea is that you could create a stockpile of twin disks ahead of time and
then ship'em out as necessary.  Duplicating 2gigs worth of data each for
one or two thousand pairs would be relatively difficult.

I'm confused.  From Avi's paper, I know that Betsi is a system
composed of software, people following instructions, and various
telephone companies' directory assistance systems.  What does it mean
for Betsi's public key to be signed by Phil?  One might think it means
that Phil has first-hand knowledge that Betsi's key really belongs to
Betsi.  But what does that mean?  How can a key belong to a complex
system?  It can't: it belongs to the people who administrator and
implement Betsi on a day-to-day basis, and those people are likely to
change (i.e., be replaced) over time.  I don't understand why Phil
signed Betsi's key.

I wonder how Phil answered this question that his own program posed to
him:

   Make a determination in your own mind whether this key actually
   belongs to the person whom you think it belongs to, based on available
   evidence.  If you think it does, then based on your estimate of
   that person's integrity and competence in key management, answer
   the following question:

   Would you trust "Betsi <certify@bellcore.com>"
   to act as an introducer and certify other people's public keys to you?
   (1=I don't know. 2=No. 3=Usually. 4=Yes, always.) ?

If he answered anything other than "No", I'd be surprized.  Phil
cannot estimate Betsi's "integrity and competence in key management",
because he cannot know who will administer and implement Betsi in the
future.

OK, so Betsi won't be signing other's people's keys (I hope), but
Betsi will be signing software.  If Phil doesn't trust Betsi to act as
a trusted introducer of other people's keys, why should I trust Besti
to "introduce" software to me?  What does it mean to trust a system?

How can it be easy to get people to trust a system implemented and
administered by people and systems you don't know and don't trust?

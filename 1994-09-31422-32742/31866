This statement is false, and probably stems from the recurring
confusion between crypt(1) (the one-rotor enigma machine) and crypt(3)
(the modified-DES-based password hashing algorithm).

In DCE, we have code which manipulateds encrypted passwords (for
backwards compatibility) and we don't do anything special on HP-UX;
the same encrypted passwords work on all UNIX systems we've ported to.

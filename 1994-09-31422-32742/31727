Actually, that idea comes up all the time; the most recent occurrence in
sci.crypt was the "Double Vigenere" thread of a little over a year ago,
wherein one poster posted a 72-letter challenge cryptogram enciphered
using two keys of length 9 and 13, whose product is longer than the
challenge cipher.  I broke it by taking advantage of the fact that the
sub-keys were re-used, even though the total one wasn't.  As with your
proposed system, as soon as the by-god hardware-random sub-keys start
getting re-used, you're no longer in OTP Heaven.

Vernam encryption requires by-god random numbers, not PRNG.  I'll repeat my
mantra from one of the recent times this came up:

And you can quote me.

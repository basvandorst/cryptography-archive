Ah... This explains why you have proposed to keep the certificates
separate from the archive they authenticate - this would make
automatic verification much simpler. I still insist that they should
be available inside the archive too - presumably not everybody will
download them via Mosaic.

OK, then maybe it should be stated that it is optional, or can contain
a list of ftp sites, or something like that.

I just wanted to make sure that you don't have in mind the "file
version numbers" that VAX/VMS uses.

I see... Still, signing a key does no imply anything about the
trustworthyness of the key owner - this is a common misconception. All
a signature on a key says is that the signator has verified that the
key really belongs to the person it claims to, and vouches for that to
the people who trust the signator as a key introducer. Since this is
exactly what you will be doing - verifying that a key really points to
a particular person - I thought that it might be useful to sign that
key.

Then maybe you should change the format of the requests and/or
certificates, and make them include some kind of identifier of the
certification method used... For the certificates this is probably not
necessary, because most signing algorithms (PGP, REM) clearly identify
themselves in a signed message. (Can you do the equivalent of
"clearsigning" with DSS?) Maybe only the request for a certificate
should be made more flexible to allow the user to specify what kind of
certificate s/he needs. But then, maybe this is unnecessary too - you
could assume that the user wants a certificate of the same type of
program that s/he has used to sign their request.

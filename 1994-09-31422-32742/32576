We have a post from another European who appears to be familiar with
European law and whose conclusions are opposite to those of Hallam-Baker, as
I read both messages. Comparing the two messages leads me to the conclusion
that Hallam-Baker has come to an erroneous result through taking only a part
of the law out of context, with reference to the instant set of facts.

Thus I am not impressed with Hallam-Baker's dogmatism. He doesn't help his
case by ending his message with a personal attack (omitted), either.

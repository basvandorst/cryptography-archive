No. Your approximation is OK. What is wrong is two things.

(1) "If R.H/ is true". The approximation does not depend on RH

(2) Your stating the error is 2.3e52.  O(sqrt(x) log x) is NOT 
    sqrt(x) log (x). It means bounded by some constant multiple of
    sqrt(x) log(x). Without explicitly knowing the constant, one
    really has no clue as to the value of the error. The constant could be
    10^30 for all you know.

    It can be explicitly computed, but it takes knowledge of the
    zeroes of the Zeta function. [their actual values]. The
    constant does get smaller [but has a lower bound] as x --> oo.

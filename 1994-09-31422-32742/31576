Because it was a public service to those of us who know Betsi only as a
claim in a newsgroup post. Though Phil may not be able to assure that
Betsi's key will be used wisely, he is able to assure that the key in
question is, in fact, Betsi's key and not a spoof or forgery.

That is valuable to those of us on the end of a wire, who know nothing about
Betsi except posted claims.

We now have a "persona" called Betsi, with a key signed by someone many
trust. THAT Betsi key, when attached to software, will serve to validate
that at least those at Betsi claim the software is unmodified.

The question of whether someone with access to Betsi's secret key can spoof
is a second-level concern. Most of us are more concerned that someone
outside the Betsi organization (such as one of the many malicious juveniles
we're familiar with on the net) might spoof. Phil's signature on the key
prevents at least that.

If the Betsi organization is sloppy enough to allow spoofing from within, or
one of the above-mentioned malicious juveniles to somehow obtain the private
key, then that's a separate problem, but Phil's signature at least
eliminates a wide variety of concerns of lower levels than that.

Life is risky; the sane man appropriately minimizes those risks under his
control, and then acts.

Translation: It is both useful and prudent not to cross against a red light,
though that's no no guarantee that you won't be hit by a lawbreaker while
crossing on the green.

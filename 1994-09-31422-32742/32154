Hi folx,
  I have a query for those on the list...  A while back I remember reading
an article in Byte Magazine on Public Key Encryption and some current uses
(this article used Cigna as its example.)  If anyone can remember which issue
this was and tell me I'd really appreciate it.

Back to lurking...
Kendall.

Well, now I begin to understand what alt.binaries.pictures.girl-friends
is all about: you can send a picture to them, they will scan and post
it for you, and you can use the binary representation of the picture as
one time pad :-)

Serious: it is possible to take publically available data (news, linux
kernel patches, wheather satellite data, digital TV, ...) for one time
pads, if you are able to hide the origin of the data.  For this, you
should compress the data (reduces the most common redundanies), shuffle
around the data by applying some block cipher (DES, IDEA, ...), then
throw away most of the data (take only every third bit, etc.).

There is your one time pad.

I disagree. The problem with defining randomness in this way is that
typically *any* sequence that satisfies such a definition can be used to
solve problems in elementary number theory that are recursively unsolvable.
I consider that to be a property of a sequence that is in strong conflict
with our intuitive idea of random. I know this is true of other
definitions of this type and I expect it is true of Knuth's. I checked
his definition but do not have time to see if I can sketch a proof of this.
If I can do this some time I may write him about it.

I met Phil in person at a conference. We spoke on the phone
and verified fingerprints. I am personally the only person 
who is administering the Betsi key right now, and the only
copy that I use is on my personal laptop, when I am not on
the network. I have another copy of the Betsi key, encrypted
under my passphrase (which resides only in my head) in a
safe place.

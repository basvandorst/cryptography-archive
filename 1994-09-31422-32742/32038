Uh huh.  Now, you tell me.  If one of the main reasons for dealing
in cash is to release people from the burden of paying income tax
(and, I agree, not everyone considers that an acceptable reason), 
do you REALLY want to pay someone a fee each time you access your
cash?

I think CyberCash is doing the right thing, for the wrong reasons.
In effect, requiring a person to pay a fee in order to access their
cash is the same as requiring a person to pay for a licence before
parking in their own drive-way (i.e., to avoid being guilty of
tresspassing).  One holds property in money, and for CyberCash
to charge a person for accessing their own money is a gross
violation of capitalism (for, you see, the money stored is 
not capital in which CyberCash holds property).  *Now*, having
said that, if Cybercash charged a flat, monthly *storage* fee
(instead of holding your cash hostage until you pay a fee), there
would be no problem: Cybercash *does* hold property in their
storage devices (computers), and it is very much consistent with
capitalism for Cybercash to make you pay a monthly licencing fee
for the use of their storage space and facilities.

But getting back to my point: the right thing for the wrong reasons.
The right thing: facilitating privacy and anonymity of digital cash
transactions.  The wrong reasons: to make money.  I am not convinced
that we need to pay for storage space...especially a centralized
one...or for the privacy services of a centralized business.  We
should be able to trade *locally* if the system is set up correctly...
when all of the information about the ownership of every dollar is
saved in one or a few centralized locations, you really are
weakening the strength and security of your privacy and anonymity
system.  If we're going to switch from paper and coin to bits and bytes
(not a good decision, in my opinion, despite the fact that it
makes cash transactions convenient and rapid) let's *at least*
do it in such a way as we *don't* pay some middle-man to spend
our own money.  With a middle-man skimming our money, we really
don't gain the freedom that privacy and anonymity are meant to 
ensure.

Paul

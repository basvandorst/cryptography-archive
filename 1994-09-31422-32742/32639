    Yes, but nobody on "your" (opposite of "other"?) side has proven
that 1-4 *DO* apply. Therefore, David, my advice to you would be to
drop the topic. Either let the courts decide, or move this argument
over to one of the legal newsgroups, where it belongs. Having you
reassert yourself every five posts isn't helping *anyone*.

Not, so, David. There is a formal procedure for initiating an RFD.
You haven't followed it.

If it comes to a vote, mine will be against the charter expansion.
There is already a talk.politics.crypto group, where discussion of
crypto-related legal issues more properly belongs.  Discussion of
these issues has little or no place in a "sci."  group, and I (for
one) would be glad indeed to see them move elsewhere.

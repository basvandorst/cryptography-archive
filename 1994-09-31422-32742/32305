Bill:

Yes the USA is *currently* a first to invent country (one of only two in
the world, the other is, I believe, the Phillipines [sic]).  That does not stop
the above situation from happening.  This is because a trade secret is, by
definition, not in the prior art that is examined to determine the 
patentability of the subject matter.

This is the reason that the Congress is currently considering a bill to allow 
"prior user rights".  This would prevent such a situation from happening.

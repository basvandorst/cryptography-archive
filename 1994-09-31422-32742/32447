The phrase "shrink-wrap licenses" is being used ambiguously. That's why I
use specific sets of facts.

Let's assume your comment applies if the above is the only set of facts. Now
let's add a notice on the outside of the box as is common practice. For
example, Symantec's Norton Utilities says "Use of this product is subject to
acceptance of the Symantic License Agreement included in this package".

As I understand the legal thinking, from my e-mail correspondence with an
attorney (I don't say who since I don't have his permission to publish his
letter), shrink-wrap agreements, as defined to be contained entirely in the
package, with no notice outside the package or separate agreement are
unenforceable because they attempt to convert what has the character of an
outright sale into a different kind of transaction. Few modern software
commercial transactions are of this character. Most have a notice on the
outside of the package that the product is licensed, and a license as
described in my first paragraph above, inside.

I understand in the same conversation with the attorney that if
there is a notice on the outside of the package, the matter is not settled
law, and thus the "not a glimmer" etc. comment becomes inaccurate.

How this might apply to mail order sales where the buyer can't read the
package in advance,I don't know. I assume the mail order vendor has some
kind of general notice in his catalog or advertisement to put the buyer on
notice that some products are licensed, not sold.

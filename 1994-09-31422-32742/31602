Ok This leads to two fundamental responses:

1.If we assume the  implication is correctly drawn:

 (a) The response is meaningless to me unless some means
     of evaluating the security of other algorythms has also been meaningfully
     expressed. We still, it seems to me, do not therefore have any meaningful
     answer to the  original question. IMHO the response only lays the
     foundation for circular argumentation.
      

2. If we assume the implication does not hold true:

 (a) We still do not find a meaningful answer to the original question.
 
 
 
 So far the only responses with any meaning are also based upon an 
 an uproven assumption namely that factoring is the only means of "breaking RSA"
 and  then upon another layer of assumptions about the difficulty 
 of factoring.

                                           ^^^^^^^
What is the significance of the word serious here?

Not really. I do not think the nettle has been grasped seriously.

Have you seen the question I posed  asking:

If you were asked to produce a response to the question:
 "How safe is RSA"
 
 Under what heading would you produce your analysis?

I am sad to say there is no field of human endeavour, or any human for that
matter, totally devoid of corruption.

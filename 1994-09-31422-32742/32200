	I came across some code recently that used:

(input)^3 mod (constant)        as the decryption algorithm.

Does anyone have any information as to the strength
of this - what the encryption routine is - whether
the constant is prime, product of primes, ... ????
Basically, any information I can get would be
appreciated.

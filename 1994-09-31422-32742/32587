Hardly. There are plenty of clean-room re-engineerings of IBM's ROM BIOS
code which is public though protected.

All you have to do is prove the programmers never saw the code itself, and
that the worked from functional specifications. That's been proven legally
several times before, in the BIOS cases.

In the RSADSI case you cannot write functional specifications for the crypto
kernel which don't violate the trade secrets. That is the clean room problem
here. You cannot describe the transformation from input to output (as you
can for various BIOS functions) without describing the trade secret itself.

Had you asserted a lesser point, it would be correct, but rather
unconvincing. That is--the published code would prevent those who read
it--those on the cypherpunks list, from clean-room reproduction (independent
of the point in the previous paragraph). But it is highly unlikely RSADSI
would reveal the code just to "get" a few cypherpunks who weren't known to
be trying to re-engineer RC4 at the time. What's more, they'd be taking a
big risk with respect to others who hadn't seen the leaked code.

Your hypothesis doesn't make sense.

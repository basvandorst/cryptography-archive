Foo!  I hear rumors about spider-bodied aliens that like to kidnap
people which theoretically may be true, but I don't make them my
concern.

Ok, let's consider the NSA can easily crack PGP: they do have the
computing power, but 1. Do they want to read YOUR messages? and 2. Just
because the NSA could theoretically do so, it doesn't mean that your
local SysAdmin, SysOp, college dean, police, housemates, corporate
competitors, or the average snooper can do so.

The NSA, KGB, MI-5, etc. would not be intersted in reading my mail or
looking at files I have, encrypted or not.  (In fact, it would be a
waste of their time to read evertything as if they weren't
encrypted.)

Other people might be interested either, but maybe they would be. Either
way private mail is not the business of anyone it's not sent to and PGP
is "pretty good" enough for those who are more likely to do the
snooping.

Consider who is most likely to be interested in the contents of your
stuff: Your personal records may be useless to the NSA, but very
worthwhile to a business competitor.

Of course, if someone invents a "magic spectacles" program that is worth
running on a PC or Mac, then the situation changes.

Speaking of breaking codes, didn't someone manage to decyphre RSA recently? 
I read something about it a couple of months ago (I can't remember where) 
and was wandering how safe the public key encryption algorithms really were. 
True, it took a few hundred experts a couple years to break, but they did 
it, and I'm sure that so could the FBI or CIA or whatever if they put a 
couple of Crays to it.

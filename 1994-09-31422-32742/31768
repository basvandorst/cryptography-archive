How about this?  Wind the tape all the way to one end, crack open the case,
and with a knife (or wire cutters, or whatever) cut the tape radially from
the outside edge to the spindle (if you go all the way through the spindle
and out the other side, like with a pair of bolt cutters, that's OK too).
Pop the little pieces of tape into a blender.  Press Liquify.  Quick, easy,
and if you want noise, toss the spindle in with the rest of it.

I also think it may be the next great milkshake flavor. :-)

Sternlight and others:

Does the discussion you are having on this thread have anything
to do with performance improvements to the posted RC4? In case
you can't decide, I'll answer for you : *NO* And what's worse you
are carrying on the same discussion on other threads as well. If
you want to talk about reverse engineering case law, start your
own thread (and probably sci.crypt is not the best place for it
either).

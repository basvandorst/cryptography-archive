Hi,
  I am learning to program new things in C++, and have a few questions.
I wrote a small piece of code that did some XOR'ing on encoded text I wanted
to display on the screen.  It would be decoded and displayed.  How do I do this
in C.  Is there someway I could do this in one .exe file?  When I messed
around with it, I got the encoded message by running the program, piping the
output and pasting it into my c code.  Is there a better way that actually
works?

Also, I see that there is c code to do CRC checks.  How do I integrate this
into my C programs.  I want to CRC checks on my programs, to check to see if
no changes were made.  And I want to store the CRC info in the program to check
the program.  All help and advice is appreciated.  Thanks.

Because the legal issues involved with cryptography or digital encryption
are so intertwined withthe available technology, I would concur with
Mr. Sternlight's proposal.  However, since I have been studying the area
for almost 6 months (for a Law Review Article) I am somewhat biased.
Nevertheless, those who understand the fundamentals and inticacies of
encryption schemes may not understand the limits of legal argument versus
political argument. And those unfamiliar with technical specs. for
algorithms may be fatally imprecise when articulating legal arguments.
Still, I do think that it might be best for legal minds to meet
engineering, cs, and math minds--we could all benefit sometime down the
road when we are imprisoned for utilizing methods to ensure private
communication--but that is a political issue in itself.
 
For what its worth

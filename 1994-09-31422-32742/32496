There has been talk of trying to find out who posted that RC4 code via the
anonymous remailer.  Has there been any contacts with the anonymous
remailer owner about trying to get logs of who possibiliy could have sent
that? 

It is probably pretty obvious that RC4 is no longer a trade secret and is
now public domain.  Does that nullify the license agreements that RSADI
had with its customers?  Does Lotus still need to pay for using their
trade secret that has become public domain? 

What advantage does RC4 have over other algorithms, such as the ones used
in PGP? 

Comment:  This shows how easily information can be spread, and damage a
company's business within seconds.  Hopefully this will wake up companies
that are connecting to the Internet, that they should be careful about
security.  Not that RC4 code was obtained by breaking into RSADI's
computers, but that if someone can get your information, they can pretty
much cost you a fortune and with no way to take any kind of recourse,
since the person was anonymous.

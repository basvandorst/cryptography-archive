Well, my senior year has just begun, and I have to do a senior
thesis -- a pretty large one-year research project.  I'd like
to do something related to cryptography.  I was wondering if
anyone might have some suggestions for a thesis topic that is
appropriate for 6-9 months of study.  Any ideas would be greatly
welcomed.

Thanks!

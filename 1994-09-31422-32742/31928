I'm not sure how many other people here have had this experience, but
recently I had the pleasure of witnessing the Clipper in action. The
particular phone devices (which ran around $1,300 a piece, of course you
need two :) ) used 4800bps modems and in order to get the data through
quick enough it removed much of the voice inflections and volume(for
some reason). This rendered the devices nearly unusable, at least for
casual privacy. Basically the concensus was that if a three letter
organization wanted to here what you were saying, they wouldn't need a
wire tap... they'd just stand outside your house and listen to you
scream into your phone.

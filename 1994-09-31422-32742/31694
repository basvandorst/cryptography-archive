   Just a quickie... Can anybody recomend a decent Multiple Precision 
   (integer!) math library? Preferably one with source included :-)

The GNU project's gmp is reputed to be ok; however, I have never used it.

The package I use and really like is Arjen Lenstra's LIP (Large
Integer Package).  The RSA-129 collaboration used it for the networked
factoring of a moderately famous integer.

The RSA-129 code is very widespread; a copy may be found (for the time
being) in black.ox.ac.uk:/math/rsa129/mpqs.tar.Z including full
source.  The latest version of LIP is available from Lenstra
(lenstra@bellcore.com) but his lawyers have insisted that he get some
sort of signed license agreement before he can release the software.
To find out more, you should get the files README and agreement.plain
(or agreement.ps) from bellcore.com:/pub/lenstra -- the file
lipdoc.ps.Z might be interesting as well.

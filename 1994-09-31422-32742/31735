How are the sub-keys generated?  Are they derived from the output of the
random number generator?  If so, they are only pseudo-random, and the
virtual one time pad is also not random.

The long "random" character string is not random.  Anyone who knows the
5124 character key can recreate it easily.  Essentially the OTP appears
to be a large lookup table for your real cipher, which is based on the
random number generator.

If this is not the case, please let us know why not.  Maybe you would like
to post a sample of encrypted text of 500 words or so, as a challenge.

You could get someone to post it on alt.sources for those of us in
Usenetland.

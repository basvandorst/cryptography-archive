Might have been a random busybody.

A few years ago I made the unauthorized English translation of
"The Japan That Can Say No" publicly available on a mailserver.  A
person, at a large computer company, took it upon himself to mail
to root@my.machine about this copyright violation.  Mistake.

I wrote a very polite note to **his** root, saying that I didn't
wish to offend this corp, and would disable any accesses to my
system from them, if they wished.  However, I was curious just who
this person was, who was complaining to me, and did he speak for
this corp?

Wow, a few hours later he **telephoned** me saying he hadn't meant
any harm at all, and had emailed my root only since he couldn't
figure out how to contact me.

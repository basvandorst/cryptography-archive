A question.  Has there ever been any court rulings on this claim by software
manufacturers that when you walk down to Egghead and purchase a software 
package, you are only purchasing a liscence???  If you sign something that
says so, I can see how this can be asserted.  However, the only thing that
most of us sign when we buy software is a credit card slip or a check, so this
claim is much weaker--only as strong as the "shrink=wrap" agreement printed on
the package.

Shrink-wrap agreements DO exist in other circumstances--many credit cards come
with such agreements--i.e. if you use the card, you are bound by the terms of
the credit agreement.  However, there may be laws which specifically give 
banks the right to do this, which don't apply to the purchase of software.

As far as the claim that the purchaser does not own the physical disks 
themselves (ignoring the software on them), THAT is bogus.  Disks are a
tangible item, NOT intellectual property.  That is like claiming that Simon and
Schuster still owns the paper and bindings of the books they sell, or that
RCA owns the blank casette or CD.  In fact, neither book publishers or record
companies even TRY to assert that buyers of books and music are simple 
licensees, and not owners of the object in question.  And they don't need to.
Copyright law well defines the rights and responsibilities associated with 
over-the-counter purchases of intellectual property--you are barred from 
selling copies of your favorite CD not because of any license agreement with 
the publisher, but because copyright law expressly prohibits such activity.

If software companies want to keep people from reverse-engineering their stuff,
then maybe they should get copyright law changed to include reverse-engineering
as a prohibited activity.  Use of shrink-wrap agreements to attempt to claim 
more rights than granted by law is dubious at best, IMHO.

I'm not a lawyer, so take this with the usual amount of NaCl....

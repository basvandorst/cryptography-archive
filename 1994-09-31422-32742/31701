The library function crypt() is a hash function that works by using
the DES algorithm (modified by the use of a "salt") to encrypt a
constant string with the supplied password.  This is used for
Unix password checking.

The program crypt encrypts file using a rotor algorithm.  The user's
password is hashed using the library function described above before
applying the enigma algorithm, with the intention of slowing
brute-force attacks.

Thus the crypt program uses the DES algorithm but decrypting a file
encoded by it does not require inverting the DES encryption.  Some
years ago a program called the crypt-breaker's workbench was posted to
the net which can fairly easily decrypt such files, at least if the
data was not compressed before encryption.

As far as I know, Unix never used a rotor algorithm for password
encryption.  The confusion presumably results from the fact that
the rotor-based program and the DES hashing library function are
both called "crypt".

Ooooh!  I didn't know we had a king.  I thought we were an
autonomous collective.

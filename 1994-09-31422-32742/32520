That's not what you said at the time, though.

And it's the first claim I've seen that seriously suggests that the code
in question can be broken in that way (as a practical proposition, I
mean; I am quite aware that it is theoretically possible).

Other way round. A licensee doesn't necessarily have the code. They may
only have object files, in which case the licence *does* still apply.

If the assertion is true, and case 2 applies, then someone broke the
licence. What doesn't follow about that.

Do you know me ? Have we met in person or on the net before ? Or do you
mean "where" rather than "who" ?

Not as I read it. He asserted that, if the code were reverse engineered
(by which I think he means disassembled), then *someone* subject to such
a contract breached it. He did *not* say that the reverse engineer did so.

We really don't know whether this trade secret was improperly obtained.
Note the exception of 'reverse engineering' in California law:

3426.1.  As used in this title, unless the context requires
otherwise:
   (a) "Improper means" includes theft, bribery,
misrepresentation, breach or inducement of a breach of a duty to
maintain secrecy, or espionage through electronic or other
means.  Reverse engineering or independent derivation alone
shall not be considered improper means.
   (b) "Misappropriation" means:
   (1) Acquisition of a trade secret of another by a person who
knows or has reason to know that the trade secret was acquired
by improper means; or
   (2) Disclosure or use of a trade secret of another without
express or implied consent by a person who:
   (A) Used improper means to acquire knowledge of the trade
secret; or
   (B) At the time of disclosure or use, knew or had reason to
know that his or her knowledge of the trade secret was:
   (i) Derived from or through a person who had utilized
improper means to acquire it;
   (ii) Acquired under circumstances giving rise to a duty to
maintain its secrecy or limit its use; or
   (iii) Derived from or through a person who owed a duty to the
person seeking relief to maintain its secrecy or limit its use;
or
   (C) Before a material change of his or her position, knew or
had reason to know that it was a trade secret and that knowledge
of it had been acquired by accident or mistake.
   (c) "Person" means a natural person, corporation, business
trust, estate, trust, partnership, association, joint venture,
government, governmental subdivision or agency, or any other
legal or commercial entity.
   (d) "Trade secret" means information, including a formula,
pattern, compilation, program, device, method, technique, or
process, that:
   (1) Derives independent economic value, actual or potential,
from not being generally known to the public or to other persons
who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use; and
   (2) Is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the
circumstances to maintain its secrecy.

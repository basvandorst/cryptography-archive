Just to add a shameless plug: SFS and Secure Drive are, I understand,
fine packages for the DOS world.  My CFS package provices similar
services for Unix-ish platforms. It includes DES and 3DES and has hooks
for adding your own block ciphers.  It's free (with source code) in
the US and Canada and has a reasonably non-facist license.  For details
on how to get it, anonymous ftp research.att.com:/dist/mab/cfs.announce .

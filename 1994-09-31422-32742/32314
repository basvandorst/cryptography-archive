David, you're bound and determined to go around making a fool of yourself,
aren't you?

Let's make this perfectly clear, shall we?

You're asserting that RSA's "agreements", presumably with it's licensee's,
contain a claus prohibiting people from reverse engineering, and that
therefore, people in California bette watch their backs, even though the
California Penal Code says it's ok; right?

I see 2 possible outcomes here:

1) 	A reverse engineer is a licensee, and there can be covered by the
	more restrictive terms in that license... but why would such an
	engineer _need_ to do this.  They'd _have_ the code.

2)	A reverse engineer is not a licensee, and therefore isn't covered
	by such a more-restrictive clause, but rather by 3426.1, which
	explicitly permits such work, _and cannot be overruled by a
	private contract to which the purported offender is not a party._

	(Ever hear of the Uniform Commercial Code?  Produce the contract.)

This isn't the first time you've tried to pull this stuff... but luckily,
some of us _listened_ in Logic 101.

Cheers,

Burma Shave was a product whose most famous method of advertising was
to place a sequential series of billboards along a highway with a part
of the message on each board.  The messages were often quite humerous
and proved to be quite good at making the Burma Shave comany quite
famous (e.g. they are remembered long after thier product has passed
from the scene...)

The one I most remember hearing about is (each line on a different
billboard): 

In this world
of toil and sin
your head grows bald
but not your chin.
Burma Shave.

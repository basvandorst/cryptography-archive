Nah.  Substantive answers should be posted here to the newsgroup,
since it's an interesting crypto problem.

How on earth can understanding the contents of the read-only
part of the phone card (that can be programmed only at the factory
because of a security fuse) assist in phone fraud in any practical way?
Does David know something we don't, or is he blowing smoke as usual?
I never would have figured David for a phone freak, but anything
is possible, I guess.

Hint: If you had a way of programming a blank chip and reattaching it to
the card (e.g. if you happen to have a megabuck lead bonding machine
handy) and were trying to commit fraud, you could just copy the data
out of an existing card and not care how the checksums are computed.

Does David seriously think the phones remember the serial number and #
of units left of every card anyone uses, and radio the police if the #
of units mysteriously increases?  (Note: the phone knows when to
deduct a unit because the telco sends an ultrasonic pulse to the phone
when enough time has been used; unless I'm very confused, the remote
computer doesn't care about the card's contents).

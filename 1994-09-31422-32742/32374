Your simple observation is false.  There are plenty of people on the net
who will protect property rights, chastise pirates, and so on.  Opinion
is against RSA DSI principally because the RSA algorithm was developed
with funds taken from my pocket, because the algorithm is fairly simple
(below the level many people believe should be patentable), and because
their patent (or claim) is overbroad.

For companies that do business fairly and honestly, putting their own
money into developing algorithms and/or software and then selling it to
be governed either by copyright law or a pre-negotiated contract (as
opposed to the hidden shrink-wrap licenses), most people on the net will
support their rights.

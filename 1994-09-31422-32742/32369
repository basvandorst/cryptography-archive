This is inaccurate. The books and CDs are sold. They rely on copyright
protection of the content.

In contrast, much software is licensed, not sold. They retain ownership
of the materials on which the software is embedded under most licenses I've
read.


Same disclaimer--I'm not an attorney and the above isn't legal advice, just
my layman's understanding.

Oops. layperson's understanding.

I am glad you say "strong argument" rather than "established law". Too
often, those who feel justified in violating established law (and unless and
until a court preempts the California law, IT is established law) do so
based on the belief that it isn't.

In some cases, those who justify out and out violation rationalize with
sophistry. We used to see many software pirates pop up and attempt to do
this.

As a matter of simple ethics, I see a big difference between someone who
says "it is o.k. to do x" followed by an argument, rationalization, or
sophistry, and one who says "doing x seems to be currently forbidden by law
but I think I can get away with it because" followed by the same material.

Although I have expressed the above distinction a bit harshly to put the
matter in graphic relief, the point is one of both personal responsibility
and not misleading others. In my first example, there is the possiblity of
misleading, and a failure to take responsibility. In the second example the
writer takes responsibility, and warns others that he is relying on his
argument or interpretation and not on settled law.

   Hmm.  It seems to me that if there are only a billion (2**30)
   primes in the range, then a brute-force search through these
   should lead to a viable attack.

Nope, he wrote "billions".  With an "s".  For 512-bit primes, there
are about 2^503 primes.  Therefore, there are about 2^473 billions
primes in this range or, if you prefer, 10^142 billions.  Plenty to go
around.


   I recommend a distributed-computing effort a la RSA-129 to
   look for and compile a list of these primes.  Finding even, say,
   100,000 of them, and making these available to cryptanalysts,
   would compromise the security of RSA to an unacceptable level.
   (If the figure of one billion is in range...)

*If*.  Unfortunately ...

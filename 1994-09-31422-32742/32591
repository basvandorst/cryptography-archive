That's a non sequitur; there was no objection made to not having a say.

Linked lists and many other data structures are also simple, but they
weren't thought of until they were needed and there was a means to
implement them.

In the history museum in Vienna, Austria, I saw safety pins thousands of
years old.  They were big by today's standards, but they were safety
pins nonetheless.

I defer to your expert opinion on that subject.

I'm not suggesting it; I'm stating it outright:  RSA DSI is not doing
business fairly.  They don't deserve the "rights" the government is
allowing them or that they are claiming.

From my own research (done while evaluating PGP's usefulness), here is what 
seems to be the prevailing answer from the experts:

Apart from the factoring attack and the obvious weakness this implies against 
small keys, RSA is as secure from attack as any other algorithm, private- or 
public-key.  Since the weak link in the chain with PGP is the RSA encryption, 
PGP can be considered secure from a methodological standpoint.  Since, 
additionally, the code has not shown any serious security flaws under close 
scrutiny, PGP can be considered secure.

The above conclusion is based on the evidence publicly available.  This does 
not mean that some government agency has not secretly broken RSA, IDEA, or 
some flaw in PGP's implementation of either of these.  It does not also take 
into account as-yet-undiscovered attacks, magic spectacles, invisible rays, 
space alien cryptographic research, psychic cryptanalysis, gravitational 
effects on RSA-encrypted messages, or any recent discoveries that Brownian 
motion in formica tabletops upon which computers sit can cause the MD5 hash 
those computers calculate to be indistinguishable from cleartext. :-)

Would this perhaps satisfy you?

Ah, yes... corrupt journalism at its best - taking idle speculation, with no 
grasp of the facts, and sensationalizing it.

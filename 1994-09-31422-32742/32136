If the SJ Mercury said the NSA allows RC4 to be exported freely, then
its reporting is flawed.  What is true (or at least used to be true)
is that RC2 and RC4 have been qualified for expidited export approval
in software products provided that the keys are less than 40 bits long
(short enough for brute force search), that the software doesn't
allow any way for the user to do multiple encryption, etc. etc.
This does *not* mean you could export 40-bit RC2/RC4 without
approval; it means that the amount of waiting and paperwork needed
to get the approval was somewhat less than that for other ciphers.

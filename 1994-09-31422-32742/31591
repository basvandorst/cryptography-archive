Is there something special about the base 2 for these tests?  I tried
some examples and could not come up with cases which passed the Fermat
test with base 2 while it was easy to find ones which passed with bases
3, 5, and 7.  For example,

p = 13411
q = 26821
n = 359696431

passes with 3, 5, and 7 but not 2.  Generally, creating composites
according to the suggested formula, it was not unusual to find the
Fermat test being passed with 3, 5, and/or 7, but it never seemed to
happen with 2.  So it appears to be much less than a 50% chance of a
composite number of this form failing with base 2, suggesting that the
estimates of how many composites PGP is passing through is too high.

I believe the RSAREF package from the folks at RSA does only a single
Fermat test using base 2 for its RSA primes.  I wonder whether they know
something about the special properties of 2 when used as a base in the
Fermat test?

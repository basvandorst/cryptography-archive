OTOH, if Jim Bizdos and company were to threaten legal action, knowing that
there is no foundation for their case, that would be extortion (a RICO
predicate offense)...and that might be repeated.  That might explain why
Jim isn't posting to the net.  I don't think it worthwhile to sue DS even
if he were nominally subject to RICO.  Perhaps that's the strategy.

Note:  I am not claiming that DS is acting on behalf of RSASDI.  It's just
that it would explain so much....

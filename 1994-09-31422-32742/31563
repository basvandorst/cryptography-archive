You're probably right about all that, but Intel wouldn't call it an
"SX".  Intel, in their wisdom, uses the SX designation differently on
386 and 486 machines.  While a 486SX is a 486 without a (functioning)
math co-processor, a 386SX is a 386 with a 16 bit data bus, and only
24 address lines brought off the chip.  I don't think Intel ever made
a 33MHZ version of their 386, but they certainly do make a 33 MHz 386,
(none of which have on-chip floating point).

To:  Anyone who posted articles re VOTPCRYP here in sci.crypt or
     has sent me EMail messages.  Jim Demberger
 
The response (articles and EMail) to Virtual One-Time-Pads is
overwhelming - overwhelming my capability to compose and post replies.
Hope to get back here soon with replies but right now my Postal Mail
addressed to "Next-of-kin of" and the Direct Deposits to my bank
account that were reversed to Direct Withdrawals have first priority
on my time.
 
My master Social Security record somehow ended up with a 1 June 94
date in the date-of-death field.  I thought that the Social Security
Administration was supposed to be using a secure encrypt network and
that they would have an audit trail that shows who, when and from what
terminal an entry had been made however I have heard that their system
has been hacked.  Aw Shucks - it was probably just a data entry error
and someone who did die on 1 June 94 is still getting his SS payments.
 
Apparently no one recognized the "01Challenge" as a plant. I may write
stupid but I am not so stupid as to put the Session Phrase "01Challenge"
on the first line of a "live" VOTP.HDR block or to use plain text
from one of UUENCODE files that I posted.  Details will follow in
another article.

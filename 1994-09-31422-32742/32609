Quantum cryptography is a cryptosystem that is secure against an
eavesdropper with infinite computing power because the system is based
on the uncertaintly principle of quantum mechanics rather than on
computational complexity. Is such a system necessary?

What I am asking is, given the rate at which computing power is
increasing, the rate at which cryptosystems are being broken, and the
rate at which newer and better cryptosystems are being created, is it
possible that in the near future that every known cryptosystem based
on computational complexity will be broken? Or, are new cryptosystems
being created at a rate that exceeds the increasing capacity of code
breakers?

I am coming from a quantum optics background, so, although I know a
lot about the physics aspect of quantum cryptography, I do not know
very much about cryptogroaphy proper. So please forgive me if this is
a common question.

I am presently engaged in funded research of quantum cryptography, and
this question has arisen. The actual form of the question that came up
is, "Who would every want to buy this (expensive quantum cryptography
system)?" The answer has an enourmous bearing on whether my funding
continues or not.

Any answers?

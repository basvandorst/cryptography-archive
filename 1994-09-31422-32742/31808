I am by no means an expert in cryptography, but what about hiding the
message in one of the bits in every character. It might take some
effort to generate text that makes sense without the hidden meaning,
but it should not be impossible. Even just taking alpha characters,
there is a choice of 13 letters for each 'bit'.

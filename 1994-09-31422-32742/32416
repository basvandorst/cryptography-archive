This is a question I've been wondering about for some time
regarding encryption.  Since I've volunteered to discuss
privacy at a luncheon next month, I suddenly need an answer.
Any help will be appreciated.

How does a decryption program know when it has found the
original "text"?  If I send you a file containing data and ask
you to decrypt it, I suspect that your programs would apply
lots of transformations to the data, perhaps using English
letter frequency data (as described in a recent ACM article)
etc., but what would tell your program that it has succeeded?
Surely you can't sit there looking at the output of every
iteration?  Will your program stop when it produces all ASCII
characters?  Will it use a dictionary to decide?  What if I had
sent you an encrypted MS Word document containing lots of
non-ASCII characters?

I think the reason I'm asking this question is obvious.  If
decryption programs need to use knowledge (or guesses) about
the encrypted document, then we should be able to make
decryption that much harder by subverting those assumptions.
How would your program do if I wrote my message in Portuguese
as in my sig?  Or in Arabic in 16-bit ASCII?  Or if I sent a
diagram in MacPaint?

I hope this isn't a stupid question.  Posting it is the only
way to find out!

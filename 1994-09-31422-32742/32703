Yo, Sternlight, did you notice that ``trade secret'' means more than 
just ``secret''? There's another condition, just as Paul Rubin said.
Something can't be a trade secret if it's generally available to the
public.

RC4 is now generally available to the public. It is therefore not a
trade secret. (One can debate whether it has ever been a trade secret.)

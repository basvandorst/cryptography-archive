Umm, I have problems with this reference.  In the first place, the 
programming is in APL, which I love, but APL is not readily comprehensible
to many readers.  In the second place, there are typographic errors in the
S-boxes.  In the third place, IMHO, the book is more an exercise in APL
than an understanding of DES.

The book that I consider the bible of DES is _Cryptography: A New Dimension
in Computer Data Security_; Meyer and Matyas; John Wiley & Sons; 1982.

As for tips for software implementation, I think there is a bag of tricks
floating around the net, but I don't recall where.  Certainly, 
Outerbridge and I think Gillogly have a lot to say about this, perhaps in 
old posts to this newsgroup.  There are a lot of tricks in that bag, and
you really want to know them.

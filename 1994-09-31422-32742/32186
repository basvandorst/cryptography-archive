That doesn't relieve you of the ordinary care responsibility if you use the
program other than its "normal" manner, for example by decompiling or
publishing. You know it's commercial code (it probably even has a warning
"banner" with the vendor's property statement), and thus are obligated to
check any agreements or restrictions before doing anything beyond what your
employers have told you to do with it, i.e. run it.

Richard Pell sez:
"I'm not sure how many other people here have had this experience, but
recently I had the pleasure of witnessing the Clipper in action. The
particular phone devices (which ran around $1,300 a piece, of course you
need two :) ) used 4800bps modems and in order to get the data through
quick enough it removed much of the voice inflections and volume(for
some reason). This rendered the devices nearly unusable, at least for
casual privacy. Basically the concensus was that if a three letter
organization wanted to here what you were saying, they wouldn't need a
wire tap... they'd just stand outside your house and listen to you
scream into your phone."

- Ah, but then a new form of encryption technology would emerge, for your
safety of course, to use a public key cipher on your actual voice! The chip
would be installed into the throats of all US citizens, and encrypt the voice
before it leaves the mouth. This way, criminal elements will not be able to
understand you, and thus making the world a safer place. Of course, no one
else could understand you either, (besides the person you are directly
talking to) without the privete (sp) key which only the government is privyt
to, in case it needs to monitor what you say.

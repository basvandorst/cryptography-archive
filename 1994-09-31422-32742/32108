You completely misunderstood.

For the benefit of those just tuning in, RC4 was a cryptosystem
developed by at RSA. Rather than patenting RC4, it was protected under
trade secret law. The claim made by RSA is that the posting of
improperly obtained RC4 sources constituted a violation of their trade
secret protection. No one is claiming anything at all about the
security of RC4. This is an intellectual property dispute.

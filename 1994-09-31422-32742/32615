Well, then I don't use it but take it out of that Box, wrap in into
some nice Gift Paper, and give it to my Nephew.

I didn't use it, so I didn't violate the Contract. (Or does the english
Word "use" include passing it on? I doubt that, and even if so, such
a broad Meaning might get tossed in Court: Giving it back for a Refund
would be "Use" in that Sense, too, and you certainly won't tell me that
Symantec can impose Restrictions on *all* Refunds, even if the "Restric-
tions" happen to be empty.)
My Nephew didn't see the Box, so he has no Contract with Symantec he could
breach.

Still thinking you alone can solve the Problems of Software Copyrighting
and its Control, Mr. Sternlight?

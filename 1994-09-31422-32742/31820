You just keep guessing until you get output equal to the known
plaintext (if you have some), or at least output that looks like
English if you have no known plaintext.  The amount of ciphertext
that you need to determine when you've guessed the right key is
called the unicity distance (see any book on cryptography).  For
your system, the unicity distance is just a few characters.

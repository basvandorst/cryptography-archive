Basically all conventional cryptography depends on unproven
conjectures about complexity classes, e.g. P < NP.
If someone proves tomorrow that P = NP, this would be
a very shocking result, but in principle it could happen,
and then complexity-based cryptography would be pretty much dead.

In fact, no cryptosystems are known to be NP-complete.  If a
cryptosystem is provably NP-complete, that would show that NP = co-NP,
which is another open problem at the moment.  (Most theorists think
that NP != co-NP, I think).

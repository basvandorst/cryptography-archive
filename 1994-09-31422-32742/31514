    A recent Scientific American article detailed how
    an RSA code was broken.  They used some fancy math
    to break the problem into smaller ones, and gave
    them to university types all over the world (very,
    very distributed computing) and reassembled the
    answer.  Took about a month to break the code.
    Also needed to be discussed accross the Internet
    to do it.  But, if a bunch of Hackers (them that
    us in the White Hats fight) broke into a lot of
    unprotected machines, or assembled an enormous
    pile of junked PCs, they could do it, that's been
    proved.  So, I guess the only answer for now is
    bigger keys, or applying as-yet-unknown algorithms
    to confuse folks.  Just goes to show you, you
    shouldn't publish the method if you really don't
    want it hacked to bits.

RSADSI's direct sales as well as Lotus, Apple, and others passing on
RSADSI's terms and conditions are not "shrink wrap" licenses in the original
sense, since you get to read the license before you unseal the disks, and
can get your money back if you don't like it. What's more, there is no
"sale" of the disks, which remain the property of the licensor, so there is
no possibility of the claim the acquirer "owns" the disks and doesn't have
to comply with the license if he got the package before reading said
license.

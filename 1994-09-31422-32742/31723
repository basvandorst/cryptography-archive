That's a boring way to do it, and for keywords over 8 letters or so it
will take too long.  A better way is to find the probable period using
average IC across the columns, take a frequency count on each column, and
slide the resulting alphabet against a frequency count of standard English
or Basque, whichever you're trying to decrypt, to see where the most
likely spots are for it to line up.  If you have enough depth (maybe 10 or
so periods of ciphertext) this'll work right off the bat.  If not, you can
use trigraphs or anything else to check your resulting text for
Englishness (or Basqueness), trying various placements for each column.
The nice thing about Vigenere is that virtually everything works... very
nice linear and porous system for budding cryptanalysts to try.

Yeah, that's going to get us to code it for you.  Touch the keyboard --
it's fun!

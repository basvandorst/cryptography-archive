Think about it.

I said nothing about YOUR criminal intention. I spoke of posting a certain
kind of information publicly.

But as Shakespeare might say about your above response: "Methinks the
gentleman protesteth too much." Given the language you use, I smell smoke,
and I'm not referring to your temper.

>Just before I read your posting someone warned me by mail

Posting an ad hominem doesn't change that it's a bad idea to request
information that might be useful in phone fraud over the public internet.
Instead, it shows the bankruptcy of those who post such attacks.

There are some posters here who are ethical zeroes. To attack the notion
that one should not publicly solicit information that might be helpful in
breaking the law by use of the word "authoritarian" simply shows that such
people, having no answer, try to attack the messenger. As for "idiot", that
charge, lacking a factual basis, can only be regarded as a projection of the
user's own self-image. It's not a very pretty sight. :-)

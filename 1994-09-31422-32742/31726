The key(s) for the virtual O-T-Ps are in no way based on any scheme to
generate "truly" random numbers.  The program operates at character
(00hex to FFhex) level, no bit diddling except for XORs.

Is Vernam XOR encryption using a O-T-P a cipher system?  Not in my book.

Actually from three different sub-keys each of which are a list in
random order of the 256 characters from 00hex to FFhex.

What amazes me is the fact that, as far as I know, no one has come up
with the idea used in the program to create a very long random character
key by XORing three short random character sub-keys.  "Short" equals 510,
508 and 506 characters; "very long" equals 510 * 508 * 506 or 131,094,480
characters if you ever need to encrypt a file that large.
 
Thanks for your comments however you probably would have had entirely
different comments if you had run the program and read the documentation
file.  I tend to agree with you regarding a moderated newsgroup,
especially after seeing the facetious replies to a request for a method
to create a "random character string".  It was case of uploading the
program to four different forums on CIS where there were over a 100
downloads and not getting any comments and then posting a message over
here that may generate a lot of flames that have no relevance to the
program and a few messages offering some constructive criticism.

    I wrote it 10 years ago. I quickly found out that it wasn't worth
very much as a cipher, but it made really neat pictures. Can you say that
about your program?

    I apologize. I should have run it through a spell checker.


    I do have a suggestion for you. I have seen your followups that do
describe the algorithm (which I still don't feel is *that* secure),
and you would have saved bandwidth if you had posted the algorithm
from the start.

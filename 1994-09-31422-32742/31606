The CIA gathered evidence against Aldrich Ames by bugging his home
computer (for quite some time).  If Ames was using a cryptosystem, he
handed the CIA his passphrases every time he typed them.  No
cryptanalysis was necessary (except perhaps after his arrest for those
passphrases he did not happen to type before being arrested).

Not nearly as difficult as that, you need 10000 IIRC quantum well gates
They have been made, but only 1 per chip, what is needed is to intgrate
them onto a bit of silicon (or GaAs or whatever) and provide the interface
circuitry. Hitatchi are reportedly working on this, and with good reason
IIUI the civilian benifits alone would be immense, weather forcasting
only one of the possible benifits.
Now a Ringworld is difficult, for a start you need a lot of Scrith :-)

Don't laugh just yet.

Until (if) the AA BBS case ruling gets overturned, anything is possible.
(A bit of pessimism here.) 

This case is clearly an example of how disparate geographical and local
law (community standards, in this case) can affect some poor schmuck
on the opposite side of the United States.

This is a disturbing trend and could possibly have lasting impact if
not overturned.

A reminder.

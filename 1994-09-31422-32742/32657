This one was actually tried in alt.flame as a person tried to stop a person
from posting on the ludicrous grounds that it cost money to store the posts.

In the case of copyright a lot of companies tend to forget that in order
to get copyright protection in the UK for a published work of which 50 or
more copies are made a copy must be submitted to each of the four copyright
libraries. I have not come across many copies of Synphony in the Bodleian.

Copyright and patent law expressly do not protect secrets. The whole point
is to discourage using trade secrets to protect intellectual property.

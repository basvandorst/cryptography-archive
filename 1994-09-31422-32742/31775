    I agree with this with a couple of quibbles.  First to confirm,
some Ultra intelligence was not directly the result of cryptanalysis,
unless you use Admiral Hall's definition of "practical cryptanalysis."
Some keys and rotors, and even messages in clear, were captured in
naval engagements planned for the purpose.  But Ultra always indicated
the intelligence was derived directly from German or Japenese
communications, even when the recipients of the information didn't
know the source.

    Second, the co-operation on cryptographic matters between the US
and UK began during the summer of 1940.  (During the war for the UK,
before the war for the US.)  However, the exchange of personnel and
cipher machines did not start until early 1941.

    Last, Kahn wasn't the first to talk publicly about Ultra.  (I
looked for but couldn't find the reference.)  I think the story was
broken in 1963, but only in Polish!

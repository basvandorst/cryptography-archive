 I have a question about the TTP, trusted third party
 that is needed to manage the directory with public keys
 in a public key crypto system. The question is:

 Is there any foolproof way to guarantee the authenticity in
 the register without giving the TTP a possiblity to by lying
 about which key is the correct one, and monotoring the traffic
 thus being able to read all traffic?

 Do you have to trust the TTP implicitly or is there a
 way around this?

 Please reply via email!

 Regards,
 Ingerun

No. The issueis, Could we on the net who have seen the RC4 code be
presumed to KNOW that the code was obtained by inapproprite means and
thus illegal for us to use. The poster was pointing out that since 
RC4 is legal to ship outside the country, and since California law does
not apply outside the USA, the relevant law as far as deternmining
whether or not RC4 was obtained by inappropriate means is foreign ( in
this case British) law. That is not irellevant at all. Your "without
permission" phrase in the law, must include permission as dealt with
under the law of the relevant territory concerned. If the person in
Britian can be deemed under the law  of Britian to have permission to do what he/she
hypothetically did- namely reverse engineer the RC4 code and then
publish it, then that
action does not fall under the California code as theft even under your
interpretation of that part of the statute. It is simply
another example to you that it is not a "theorem from Euclid" that the
code was obtained and published by inappropriate means.

It may however be evidence in a court that RSA did not use approprite
means under the circumstances to protect their trade secret. They
knowingly shipped it out of the country ( they were the ones to obtain
exemption under ITAR for the code to be shipped out), and  it might be
argued,  under those circumstances they did not 
exercise the proper caution that that action would
not expose the trade secret to public revelation.

(Note the above does contain many hypotheses- I am not saying that this
is how it happened, or that the actions were appropriate under British
or anay other law, etc. I do however believe that it is evidence agaist
Sternlights primary thesis. Again I am not a lawyer. The above is not
legal advice. Get competent advice if you need it.)

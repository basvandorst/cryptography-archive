Once again I find myself running 5 years behind the times.  I have just
recently independently come to the same conclusion as is implied by the
title of the Impagliazzo & Naor paper above.  My justification of the
use of "subset sum" was based on the assumption (as yet unfounded -- I
put that question off) that it is computationally feasible to find hard
instances of the subset sum problem.

Would someone with ready access to the paper please comment on whether
I&N made the mistake of claiming (in effect) "NP complete therefore
usually hard" or if they did show (or explicitly make reference to an
assumption of) hard instances of subset sum?

(For the interested, in my construction subset-sum is used to make an
alleged one-way function, which can then be used either as the basis of
a pseudo-random generator for a stream cipher, or as a block transform
function in either a Feistel cipher or a OFB based cipher (similar to
MDC).  I have not constructed formal proofs of the block transforms'
security, but my proof-sketches look promising so far.)

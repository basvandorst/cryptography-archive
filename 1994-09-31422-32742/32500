This is true for those countries that adhere to the Berne convention
(which the US does do only a few years).  For other countries the
situation can be completely different.

Again, this is only true for those countries that allow relinquishing
of copyrights.  There are many countries that do *not* allow that.
PD is a US term.  Even if I would write at the bottom of this article
that it is in the public domain (as Mark Brader does on his articles)
I have still a copyright on it according to Dutch law because Dutch
law does not allow relinquishing of copyright.

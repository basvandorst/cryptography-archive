Neither does your insistent ignoring of the information I have provided,
and your repeated posting of what I can only assume are intentional lies.

This is false.  A trade secret is not an object.  A trade secret is something 
created by an agreement, that is a contract.  It is a fundamental, bedrock
concept of contract law that there must be mutual assent to a contract.
That is, I cannot bind you to a contract by walking up to you and saying
"Mr. Sternlight, because you are reading my posts on the Net, you owe me
$50,000."  It is the responsibility of the person seeking to maintain the
trade secret to take adequate security precautions.  Arguably,
distributing a program far and wide without negotiating confidentiality
agreements is enough to vitiate any actual, negotiated agreements RSADSI
may have had.  In any event, you can't give out pamphlets on a street
corner, stamp them with "this is a trade secret", and expect to have a
remedy at law.

Well, I'm an attorney.  And though I refuse to give anyone but my clients
legal advice, let me give you some personal advice:  if you don't know
what the law is -- and trust me, you don't -- don't talk about it.  You
will do more harm than good.

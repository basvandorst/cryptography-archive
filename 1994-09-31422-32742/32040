Having recently installed the new Apple System 7.5 and playing around with
the PowerTalk features, I was wondering what algorithim is used for the
signature/authentication function?  Rumor has it that it is a 48-bit
implementation of the MD-5 hash algorithim.  To be sure, RSA is involved,
since a copyright notice on the DigiSign Utility program mentions them
prominently.  Of course, a 48 bit implementation is hardly
secure...although it may serve a purpose up to a point.

At any rate, if anyone could advise me as to the type of algorthim used, I
would be grateful.

Also, it is fairly annoying that the signature function requires a
signature password be set up by a server somewhere.  All of the information
is present to do a hash, so why the hassle with a server?

Thanks in advance...

An absurd assertion.

You can walk over to a computer store and buy a copy of some RC4-using
software off the shelf.

Does the cashier say, ``To purchase this product, sir, you'll have to
agree not to reverse engineer it.''? Of course not. You pay cash; the
store gives you a box containing the disks. That's a contract of sale.

You then own that copy of the software. You can reverse-engineer it.

This is, presumably, what the RC4 discoverer actually did.

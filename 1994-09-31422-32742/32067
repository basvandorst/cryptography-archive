Okay, so only one person made a successful attack against your
"challenge file". Consider a couple things. #1, the average reader of
sci.crypt simply does NOT have enough time to attack an encrypted file
in his spare time. I don't find it hard to believe that only one
person had the time and will to crack the challenge file. And anyways,
the case of how strong an algorithm is NOT how many people can make an
attack on it, but on whether or not there *IS* a practical attack on
it. Once there is an attack against an algorithm that is practical for
the general case, the algrorithm can and should be considered
"broken".

Hmmm. IMHO, a block algorithm used in one of the chaining modes is
more secure than the average "VOTP"-type program (i.e. stream
algorithms that uses a stream that is based ONLY on the key). I may be
wrong.

I don't know about illegality of quoting from private messages, but
there are some points about the reasons behind the netiquette:

#1 If someone sends you a piece of private Email, the best assumption
to make is that they would like to KEEP it private, unless they say
otherwise.

#2 There are a few exceptions to #1: I.e. you asked for help, and you
would like to digest the help you got and post it for other people who
might have the same problem.

#3 I have *never* seen a time when it is appropriate to quote from a
private emailed flame. Posts that do so tend to be flames themself.

:  I have an attitude about making rules, don't may rules if there is

    I wonder what you mean by "enforced". There are levels of
enfocement. For example, do you believe there should be speed limits
on roads? Anyone can see that rarely are people *not* speeding, and
also that rarely people are *caught* for speeding. It's obviously not
well enforced. Anyways, netiquette are not "rules". They are
common sense guidelines that help people avoid the mistakes that most
of us made when we were new on the Net.

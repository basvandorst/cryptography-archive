Under California Civil Code 3426.1, reverse engineering and independent
derivation are explicitly NOT improper acquiration of a trade secret.

I think RSA has the burden of proof that the RC4 source code was
improperly acquired or published.

I would be more worried about federal penalties for trafficking in 
defense information than I would about trade secret laws.

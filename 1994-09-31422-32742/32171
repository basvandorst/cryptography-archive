My informal understanding is that Jim Bidzos (and most other folks at RSADSI) 
don't think a lot of Usenet.  If so, I can't say I blame them, overall--the 
only reason I read it myself is that I write networking software for a living, 
and it helps to know your market :).

Think of it this way:iIf you worked for RSADSI, would you bother posting to 
the net, knowing that each time you did, you'd be inundated by Usenet anti-
capitalist bozos telling you you're the spawn of Satan for wanting to make a 
make a living off of your own ingenuity?

I wouldn't.

If you don't respect someone, do not expect them to respect you.

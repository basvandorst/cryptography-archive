Most commercial software comes in a sealed envelope with something similar
written on it (this is shortened, and names have been removed, but comes from 
a legit software package grabbed off my shelf)

THIS LEGAL DOCUMENT IS AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU, THE USER, AND xxxxx.  BY

IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT YOU SHOULD PROMPTLY
RETURN THE DISKETTE(S) AND OTHER ITEMS (INCLUDING WRITTEN MATERIAL)..

This type of agreement is rather generic.  In other words, you don't own the
software or the copy of it.  You are merely licenced to use it. 

The way around this is to read the whole agreement.  This particular one
didn't say anything about reverse engineering, and therefore one can assume
that it is allowed.  But I have a feeling that any software using RSA to
encrypt will have a clause in there that disallows reverse engineering, and
something about 'making visible, any trade secrets, ...' (which I grabbed
from another agreement).

So, read them agreements.

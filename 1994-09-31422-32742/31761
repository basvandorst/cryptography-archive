Dear friends:

   I am surveying encryption products, especially hardwares and ICs.  It is,
however, difficult to find proper infos.  Can anyone tell me the following
questions:
   (1) Which company make and sell encryption ICs.  
   (2) What kind encryption algorithm those ICs are based on.
   (3) Other than encryption ICs, is there any other related products such
       as key-access EPROM, etc.

If anyone knows these answers please directly mail it to me at:

    chuang@e0sun3.ccl.itri.org.tw

I very appreciate for any related info and thanks in advanced.

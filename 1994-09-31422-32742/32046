According to various people I have spoken with, RSA Data Security Inc has
no control over anybody who uses RC4, unless they use copyrighted code
or have previously signed a license or non-disclosure agreement.  You may
want to check this with your lawyer, but it seems that all their sabre
rattling is nothing but a front.

I think the smartest thing RSA Data Security, Inc could do at this point
is to patent RC4.  They lose the secrecy, but still maintain their
financial interests.  And then they can publish all of the cryptanalysis
they have done.

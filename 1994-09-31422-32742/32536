Of course- that code is still copyright. Nor does it nullify any licenses 
unless the license explicitely stated that the license becomes invalid if the
trade secret is revealed. Lotus could go ahead and rewite their own version of the
code if it wanted to now I suppose, unless their license forbade this.

Look all of the IBM clone Bioses are neither a trade secret nor was it patented, but may many
companies license it because it is far cheaper to license than to write your own.

Since you are a security consultant, your last paragraph is rather disingenuous. Their
connection to the internet was totally irrelevant tothe  release of the  info as far as we
know. Their security of lack of it was irrelevant. The internet is an information conduit,
that's all. It could equally have been posted int he NYTimes and would have hurt as much.
At least RSA knows the info is leaked. Private leaking of trade secrets in secret to a
competitor are probably even more costly because you don;t know you have been comprimised.
I do hope that when you sell your wares and expertise, you are a bit more careful in your 
conclusions that you draw from events that occur in the computer world.

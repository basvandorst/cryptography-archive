No, they are not. This topic has been debated to death in
alt.security.pgp, when somebody posted KOH, without even a warning
that it is a virus.

Both viruses indeed use the IDEA cipher - the same that is used both
by SecureDevice and SecureDrive. However, the viruses pose some
significant threats to the integrity of your data, exactly because of
their viral replication means.

KOH is a MBR infector that encrypts whole disks. However, it is very
slow, especially when infecting disks, and the only practical way to
use it is to turn its automatic propagation off - i.e., to turn off
its viral properties, thus proving that they are completely
unnecessary. Also, if you aquire it by viral means, you do not get the
doumentation and one utility, both of which are essential for the
proper usage of the product - thus proving one more time that its
viral capabilities are unnecessary and harmful. Also, the virus does
not come in source, which means that it could have some hidden
backdoors or simply security flaws, and you have no way to check this
or to fix them. At last, in some cases the virus could destroy
valuable information during its replication process.

GV1 is a memory resident file infector, which encrypts the files it
infects. It is similar to Cruncher in the way that SecureDevice is
similar to Stacker. Again, its viral properties make it dengerous for
your data. Several programs infected by it (it infects only COM files,
although can encrypt any file) refuse to run when executed. Similarly
to KOH, it does not come in source, with all the security implications
that come with this.

In short - don't use them. You will gain nothing over using
stand-alone encryption programs, and you'll expose your data's
integrity to significant risks. Those viruses are completely useless
and even harmful; they have been created with the only reason to
condone the illicit activities of the virus writers, by claiming that
computer viruses can be "useful".

If you need a disk encryption program, we have a nice collection of
them on our ftp site:

ftp.informatik.uni-hamburg.de:/pub/virus/crypt/disk/

If you need a file encryption program, you can use PGP in conventional
encryption more (-c) - it uses the same cipher as SecureDrive,
SecureDevice, KOH, or GV1. A pretty complete collection of PGP
versions can be found on our ftp site:

ftp.informatik.uni-hamburg.de:/pub/virus/crypt/pgp/

Alternatively, you could try some of the file encryption programs
available in

ftp.informatik.uni-hamburg.de:/pub/virus/crypt/file/

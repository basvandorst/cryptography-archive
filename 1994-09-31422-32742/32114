Not necessarily.  A copy could be lost or accidentally released.  RSA itself
and its licensees may attempt to keep the secret, but they could fail.
Everyone is fallible, and accidents happen.

There is an interesting fact related to this point.  The original code as
posted on cypherpunks had a strange "typo", an expression of the form
a = b + (c) % 256.  Before it was posted on sci.crypt I believe this was
corrected to a = (b + c) % 256.  What could have caused this typo?  I can
think of a couple of plausible explanations.  One is that this was an
intentional error which was introduced into the code in order to "fingerprint"
it so that any leakage could be traced.  The other is that this was a
human error made in the process of typing in the code.

Misplacing a parenthesis would be an easy mistake made in typing in code
from a printed copy, especially by someone who was not a programmer.  (To
a programmer, the error is pretty obvious and is an unlikely mistake, IMO.)
It is not very likely to happen during machine copying of source code in
electronic form.

This suggests to me that perhaps at some point in the chain the code
was in printed form.  Could we be seeing the result of carelessness in
guarding a printed listing, either by RSA or a licensee?  Not everybody
is careful to shred everything they should.

Obviously this is very speculative, and I'm sure more facts will come to
light eventually.  But it is certainly a curious aspect of the case.

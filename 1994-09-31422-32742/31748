I include the first part of my .sig because I believe the last.

The remark is hardly "flip"; it expresses what *many* wonder, concisely.

Personally, I wonder about her motivations not because I *disagree* with her
*evaluation* of an algorithm (I'm just a mere mortal, not privledged to see
the algorithm; thus how could I, or most qualified individuals in the
community, disagree?) but I strongly question her methods and morals.

Any questions?

Someone has sent me some interesting mail about Fifth Generation System's
Disklock.  I know the Mac version of this program has major problems, but the
following description applies to the DOS version.  Does this do the same thing
as the Mac version (ie store the key along with the encrypted data)?  Here's
the relevant parts of the message I got (quoted with permission):
 
}We all know there are similar commercial products on the market that are
}poorly conceived, and their shortcomings are well-documented. But there is one
}product which has me intrigued - Fifth Generation System's Disklock. It
}doesn't make sense to me. Here's why...
}
}Presumably it encrypts the entire disk when installed, taking a long time to
}do so. A device driver is loaded in config.sys and when it runs, it asks for
}the user's password, and then allows access to the encrypted disk. Otherwise
}the disk is not bootable, and when examined by a sector editor, it shows
}apparently random information.
}
}What doesn't make sense is that the device driver loads last, after memory
}managers and the like. (In fact, the installation program puts it last, and it
}makes no difference whether it loads first or last). Now how can those device
}drivers be read from the disk in the first place??? The disk is supposed to be
}encrypted...
}
}So, I ask you, how does it cheat? Does it have the password stored on the
}disk, perhaps encrypted by Disklock using a fixed key? If that were true, it
}could obviously decrypt the designated drivers and allow them to run before
}popping up the user password screen. But then this process would have to be
}done in the boot loader or io.sys or msdos.sys, necessitating that they be
}modified or extended "a la virus". Something is rotten in Denmark.
 
If anyone wants to pick it to pieces, the person who sent me the message has an
unused copy, I can forward requests to him...
 
Peter.

I was reading an article that referred to a report by E.Brickell et al.
called "Skipjack Review Interim report: The Skipjack Algorithm", 28.7.93.

Apparently it was posted to sci.crypt at the time.
Does anyone have a copy of this, otr know of a site from which it can be
downloaded?

Thanks in advance,

Alex.

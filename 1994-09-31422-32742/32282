The above is bullshit. As usual, David spreads FUD, suffers of reading
comprehension problems, and exercises his capabilities of
mind-reading.

1) Please quote *literally* the part of Jim Bidzos' message in which
he says that he means the posting of the alleged RC4 source in his
warning.

2) Please quote *literally* the part of Jim Bidzos' message in which
he says that the code posted is RC4.

3) Please quote *literally* the part of Jim Bidzos' message in which
he says that the secret of the RC4 algorithm has been stollen.

4) Please quote *literally* the part of Jim Bidzos' message in which
he says that the code posted was the real code and not something
reverse engineered.

5) Please convince us that the message posted by you really comes from
Jim Bidzos. As you certainly know, it is trivial to forge e-mail, so I
wouldn't trust such an important message, unless it is signed by Jim
Bidzos' PGP key, and this key itself is signed by a trustworthy person
(e.g., Phil Zimmermann). :-)

Regards,
Vesselin

It's not. At least two readers have confirmed it directly with RSADSI via
mail to their President.

There are many reasons for using trade secrets rather than patents to
protect some things. In fact, many companies have a policy of not patenting,
but rather relying on trade secrets.

As far as reverse engineering is concerned, if the product is one which you
can license (perhaps we should exclude "shrink-wrap licenses" from this
statement to avoid controversy) directly and item by item, then it's fairly
common to include license terms which prohibit reverse engineering and which
will stand up in court, even in California.

You don't think all those ROM BIOS cloners went through "clean room"
procedures where they would use only programmers who had never seen the IBM
ROM BIOS code, and had no access to it during their programming, just
because they enjoy it?

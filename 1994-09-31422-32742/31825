Yikes!  Does it really mean anything to speak about
"compressing" infinite strings?  The only thing that makes any
sense to me is given a finite algorithm that generates an
infinite string, then that algorithm is a "compressed" form of
the string, because it is finite.  Other than that, what,
though???

  Do some reseach. There are numerous articles about the factoring
project, many of them are quite well done.

  I think the major point of the factoring effort is to demonstrate
that single keys can be factored by large, organized groups. An RSA key
with 409 bit keys are still safe for 'casual' use --- it would take
a medium sized government or BNR/HP/IBM sized company to have the resources
to break it. 
  As the other responder said: a 1024 isn't factorizable right now.

  Prof. Topolweski must work for Microsoft Marketing Dept.
  btw: one wouldn't say "a.k.a. infinite key" but "i.e. infinite key"

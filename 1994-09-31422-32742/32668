It's been a give-and-take throughout history.  I doubt it'll stop now,
especially with the advent of the "Information Age".  At present, the
ability to factor or take discrete logs in polynomial time (with polynomials
of sufficiently low degree and leading coefficient) would break many
cryptosystems.  Whether such algorithms exist is not presently 
known, and you'll get people taking either side.  This doesn't mean a priori 
that these are the only number-theoretic problems upon which to base
a cryptosystem.

And it doesn't imply the breakdown of private-key systems.  The one-
time pad is still secure (provided the keys are not revealed or stolen).

Defense and diplomatic establishments will have and understandable interest in 
a means of transmitting information with perfect secrecy.  It was the British 
Defence Research Agency, in association with British Telecom, that 
demonstrated a prototype quantum crypto device operating over 10km of fiber 
optic cable.  Banks will have an interest in counterfeit- and tamper-free 
"Electronic" Funds Transer.

I've taken these examples from "A Bibliography of Quantum Cryptography",
by Gilles Brassard of the U. of Montreal.  I received a copy at a talk he gave.

I don't have an ftp address, sorry.

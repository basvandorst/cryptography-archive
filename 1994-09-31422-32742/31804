I have been thinking about this too as a result of the CD OTP stuff.

Floppies have low enough information density that if you try
to overwrite them, it is probably a lot easier to recover the
old bits than it would be from a high density hard drive.

On the other hand, floppy bits are close enough together, and the
timing information is interspersed with the data, so that a
determined enemy could probably read significant size hunks
of data off the strips found in a paper shredder.

Also, for 3.5" floppies, you'd have to cut out the metal center
part in order to not ruin your paper shredder.

I think if you really want to destroy the data on a 3.5" floppy,
you should incinerate the media.

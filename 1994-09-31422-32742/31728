I hope I picked an interesting enough subject to attract some kind
of serious response...  :)

From what I've seen and read (admittedly not much), it seems to me
that cryptography is still a fairly obscure field to break into.
Here at WPI, the only crypto course I can take is the one I invent
through independent study.  I guess what I'm really wondering is if 
anyone knows of, or has heard of, any kind of "apprenticeship" out there,
if that kind of thing is common.  And if so, where can I sign up?  ;)

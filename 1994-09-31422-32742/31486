Haval was published by Zheng, Pieprzyk and Seberry at Auscrypt 92. It is
an extension of MD5 with the message block and chaining variable doubled 
in length to 32 and 8 bytes respectively; the nonlinear functions are more
complex and satisfy the strict avalanche criterion; there can be 3,4 or 5
rounds and is about as fast as MD5 when 5 rounds are used. The attack on
MD5 by den Boer and Bosselaers does not go over to HAVAL.

I don't know the page numbers of the article in the Springer proceedings
but in the preproceedings the paper is `HAVAL - A One-Way Hashing Algorithm
with Variable Length of Output', by YL Zheng, J Pieprzyk and J Seberry,
pp 3-1 to 3-10.

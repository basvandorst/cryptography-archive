Such conditions are legaly unenforcable in Europe under EU anti-monopoly
law. The directive explicitly states that such conditions cannot be enforced.

So all you need to do is to export the algorithm to the EU, reverse engineer
it and return it to the US.

Since EU monopoly law is based on US anti trust in part I would be amazed if
the US had no similar provision.


David should stop making serious allegations about others. Before he deduced
from a five line report that a company had filled a vexatious suit without
even having read the statement of claim. Now he makes similar allegations
about others having performed criminal acts. He really should take legal
advice before making such serious allegations.

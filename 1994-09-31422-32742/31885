"Of course, you can say: today's state of the art is, that choosen-plaintext
needs 2^47 cycles to break DES."

You're kidding! DES has all sorts of weaknesses. In 1977 it was breakable to
those who could afford to make a really expensive computer. When I did my
research program, we found a code called NewDES that was made in that year.
It workes EXTREMELY fast...like a few seconds to encode massive amounts of
data. It requires no hardware, as DES does in it's certifiable form. Also, it
is like next to impossible to break newDES without a new type of computer
that could do better than all the computers in the world today combined...

Anyway, I have heard of codes better than DES. There is RSA which is next to
unbeatable. (so far) And what is this IDEA code I have heard about? Give me
info on it...

Come on...I am looking for today's most highly regarded code. The cream of
the crop, the head of the pack, the...you get the point.

The point of my prior post... is that it appears that for a fixed number
of iterations of either Fermat or Miller-Rabin that the prob that it
does NOT catch a composite is (maybe) O(1/ln(n)^2)) but is NOT
o(1/ln(n)^2).

So... (unless n gets gigantic... want 1/ln(n) like exp(-k) then n is
like exp(exp(k)) one needs to make the multipliers in the big-O small...
that is, do more than a fixed number of tests (in particular, the four
tests that PGP does on Fermat for 2,3,5,7 seem to me to be rather weak).

[How many tests need one do for security in PGP?... say using
Miller-Rabin... I will not attempt to answer it... but will say that
fixing it at four, for Fermat test (2,3,5,7) does not seem to provide
sufficient security].

And, again... PGP *needs* a better primality tester (there are just too
many composites that pass the one that is used now).

(prior statement based upon the results of using random a,b,c,d rather
than 2,3,5,7... so it may not be correct)

This post is an update to a prior post that someone made about using
1/256 (wrong) for the prob. that PGP was in error (used Miller-Rabin,
1/4, for each of four test items in Fermat)... but, though his numbers
are wrong, his argument, with corrected numbers, seems to make sense.

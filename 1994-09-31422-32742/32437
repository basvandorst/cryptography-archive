In <strnlghtCwDzHs.AJA@netcom.com> Sternlight spent an entire article
saying that legal posts belong in sci.crypt (because he thinks t.p.c is
too noisy), ``now that a moderated sci.crypt.research has been created 
and is in action.''

I observed: ``Sternlight is taking the creation of sci.crypt.research 
as an excuse to drag down sci.crypt.''

Sternlight quoted this and wrote:
> Give your defamatory posts a rest.
  [ ... ]

Did he really mean this as a response? I checked with him by e-mail,
and the answer is yes.

Amazing.

As far as I can tell, he lost all memory of what he had said in the
previous article.

In case it isn't clear, folks, legal posts do NOT belong in sci.crypt. 
(This idiotic thread also doesn't belong in sci.crypt, and I've directed
followups appropriately.)

Yes, sci.crypt.research has been created, but this is NOT a reason to
drag down the original group. The charter of sci.crypt has always been
``Different methods of data en/decryption.'' No room for politics. No 
room for legal discussions.

Wait a Tick. Do you really want to say that, besides blacklisting
Nations for their military Affiliations, legal Situations etc.,
the US routinely blacklists People for doing Things in other Nations
*not* blacklisted which are perfectly legal over there, just because
they don't like the Looks of it? I knew that the US has more Phone

had, but *this* ... Wanna know what I call this?

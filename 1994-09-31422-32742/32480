This is the complete opposite of my conclusion, and I find it unethical in
the extreme that you would try to imply that this was what I told you.
I expect you to remedy this misstatement within the next two days by posting 
the complete text of both messages that I mailed you, or by retracting
publicly and prominently the implication that I said this.

Probably not, actually.  A sale is a sale is a sale.

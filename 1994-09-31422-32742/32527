HELP WANTED: CRYPTANALYTICAL ASSESSMENT
 
I am seeking from my mathematical betters an assessment of the 
computational difficulty of the following problem:
 
A ciphertext is created by the modulo 2 addition (XOR) of a set 
of row values selected from a mxn public key binary matrix where 
m>n and the ratio of m to n in bit dimensions is 144:96.  The 
public key is divided into 3-row groups (3-lets) from which rows 
are always chosen from each 3-let according to the following 
regimen: either a single row of each 3-let is chosen or all rows 
are chosen.  Every ciphertext created by this regimen has a 
unique value which can be translated by private keys back into 
the plaintext; however, no matrix inverse can be created which 
effects this transformation.  The public key and samples of 96 
bit ciphertexts are both assumed to be in the hands of an adver
sary.
 
The problem, then, is this: given the public key and a cipher
text, how difficult is to to determine for that ciphertext (by 
linear algebraic or combinatorial methods) which particular rows 
were selected to create the ciphertext.  Many thanks.

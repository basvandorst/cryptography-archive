Does anyone know details of the encryption algorithms used by Notes.

I know that the mail public key scheme is RSA (I can RTFM with the best of 
them), but how big is the key (I hear rumours that it is quite small, only 
around 50 to 60 bits)? I assume that it does not RSA encrypt the whole message 
directly, this would be too slow. What is its primary encryption scheme?

What scheme is used for document shared-key encryption?

What scheme is used to encrypt network traffic? What is the performance hit 
of switching it on? This last is particularly important, since I am trying 
to form a view of how secure Notes mail and replication would be across the 
Internet.

From what I understand of the handshaking mechanism, I do not believe that 
snooping on a handshake would allow an eavesdropper to garner enough 
information to emulate either server. Does anyone have a contrary view to 
this?

Finally, what exactly are the security compromises built into the 
International edition? Is it just a question of key sizes, or are different 
algorithms used?

TIA

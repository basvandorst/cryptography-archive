This IBM 370 assembly language programmer (Realtime TPF) must
comment on your message. What an EXCELLENT set of preliminary
design requirements. I don't know who you work for, but they are
fortunate.
 
I am more interested in this new "Voice PGP" people are talking
about. Uses a sound card and laptop computer for encrypted phone
communications. Know anything about this? Thanks for your time.
 
later.

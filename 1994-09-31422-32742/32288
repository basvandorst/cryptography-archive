   As Grady Ward and I predicted, the serious danger in publishing or
   republishing RC4 to Internet Newsgroups and mailing lists which go overseas
   automatically from the U.S. is that so to do is a violation of the ITAR, a
   Federal felony carrying big jail time. EACH export of RC4 requires an export
   license from the State Department.

   Today, on page B7 of the Wall Street Journal (maybe B10 in other than the
   Western Edition) it is reported that both the FBI and the U.S. Customs
   Service are now investigating this matter.

As you describe it, the actions of the FBI and Customs remind me of
Inspector Clouseau saying "Eet ees ze LAW!" to the organ grinder while
the bank robbers are getting away.

It really surprises me that anyone believes that it's even remotely
possible to control the flow of information in the age of computer
networks.  For every well-publicized leak like this, there are probably
hundreds of postings of ostensibly contraband export of information like
this.  What's more, this can be spread around in seconds, completely
untraceably.

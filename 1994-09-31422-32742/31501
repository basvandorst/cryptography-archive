There is a lovely protocol for demonstrating knowledge of a Hamiltonian
circuit for a published graph, using paper, pencil, and lottery
scratch-off paint. The prover draws a random isomorphism of the
graph, and paints over everything except the (unlabelled) nodes with
scratch-off paint. The verifier then asks the prover to do one of
two things: (1) scratch off all the paint and demonstrate the
isomorphism; or (2) scratch off the paint over the edges in the
Hamiltonian circuit. A prover who can do both knows a Hamiltonian
circuit in the original graph; therefore an impostor would be
unable to perform one or the other, and would have a 50% chance of
being unable to perform the one that the verifier chose.

Or did you want something more abstract? :-)

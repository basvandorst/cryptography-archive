Before I actually sit down and write up the code for a brute-force
decryptor for this type of encryption, can anyone point me to somewhere
this could be found?

What I'm about to do (to break a give ciphertext) is just write up a
simple pascal or C program to break it with a given key length for every
possible keyword combination.  Since I'm a bit too lazy to link it to a
dictionary I will probably just make it decrypt given key(1), press space
to continue or F if found (or something to that effect).

But the problem here is that I fully understand the cryptosystem, and I am
just a touch too lazy to actually sit down and code this.  I *know* there
has to be something in existence (aside from calculators and patience)
that will break it-- even if it requires extensive interaction.

Appologies for the cross-post, just seemed appropriate for both groups.
Please respond via email or post.  Thanks a bunch in advance.

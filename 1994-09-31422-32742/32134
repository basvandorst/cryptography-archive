How secure is Diffie-Hellman key agreement using a 512 bit prime, 512
bit generator, and a 256 bit Private Key.  Approx. what kind of computing
power would it take to determine the agreed-upon key if you had access
to both public keys and the prime number.  Also, how much more secure would
a connection that used a 512 bit Private Key be?

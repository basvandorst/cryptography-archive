It is not I who am making a fool of myself. Your message contains errors
which make your associated personal attacks look like the work of a juvenile
defamer.

The California Penal Code does not say it's o.k. It says that reverse
engineering, not associated with theft or betrayal of a duty to secrecy by
any party (not just by the reverse engineer) is o.k.

Putting it another way, it says:

1. If you steal the secret you're culpable;
2. If you betray a duty to keep the secret, you're culpable;
3. If you publish the secret when you could be assumed to know that someone
else did 1 or 2 (above) you're culpable.
4. Some other stuff you can do to make you culpable.
5. If you reverse engineer WITHOUT 1-4, the act of reverse engineering alone
doesn't make you culpable.

That is a far cry from "the California Penal Code says it's ok". In the
present case, there's very good reason to believe that some of 1-4 apply,
and in addition, nobody on the other side has proven that some of 1-4 didn't
happen. Thus we cannot conclude anything about the reverse engineering or
subsequent publication except that it will take a court to rule on this one.
In particular, we cannot CONCLUDE that the reverse engineer was "ok", though
many here keep ASSERTING it by posting an erroneous description, or an
out-of-context piece of the penal code.

As to the RSADSI notice et al, that's legitimate notice to insure that
people don't "innocently" publish--i.e. to protect their trade secret.
Anyone who has read that notice might be assumed to have the knowledge in
(3.) above, and thus is being warned that RSADSI asserts that they would be
in violation of the California Criminal Code if they (re)publish the trade
secret. That meets any obligation under the law for RSADSI to give notice to
third parties, an important point if the issue of whether RSADSI was
diligent in protecting their trade secrets arises in a civil case against a
publisher of the trade secret. 

If you're looking for motive, one could assert that RSADSI's notice was
posted not to frighten anyone else, but to meet any test on RSADSI
themselves that they were diligent in protecting the secret and in advising
others who might have seen the publication that the matter was trade secret.

The full code was posted some time ago in this discussion by Grady Ward, yet
people such as you keep ignoring it. That you, in particular, do so as a
basis to make personal attacks speaks volumes about your own integrity.

By the way, all of the above should be read in the context of "if" the
revealed code was obtained by reverse engineering. That hasn't been
demonstrated and there is a possibility it is the real (copyright) code in
which case the revelation and any republication also runs afoul of the
copyright laws.

I understand RSADSI intends to take legal action on this one--stay tuned.
The legal situation will become quite clear if a case proceeds to trial.
I would not be surprised to see it involve multiple defendants.

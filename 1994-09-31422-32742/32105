You're deluded.

As I said: ``Shrink-wrap agreements are not enforceable. You walk into a
store and buy a product. You now own that product and can do lots of
things with it. Your freedom is not restricted by pseudo-legalistic
gobbledygook printed on the package---even if the gobbledygook says
otherwise.''

The basic problem with a shrink-wrap ``agreement'' is that the user
never agrees to it. The way the disks are sealed is utterly irrelevant.

(Once upon a time a few states tried to change this. Louisiana passed a
Software License Enforcement Act insisting that the user really did have
to agree to shrink-wrap terms---even after he had bought the software.
How obnoxious! What an imposition on the normal way of business! A court
decided that SLEA was preempted by federal copyright law---SLEA was,
after all, an attempt to take away rights guaranteed by Section 117.)

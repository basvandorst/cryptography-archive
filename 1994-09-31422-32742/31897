John Kelsey put his finger on the confusion here: there are *two*
algorithms that call themselves "NewDES".  The one I'm referring to
is the Richard Outerbridge variation on standard DES that gets
rid of the IP and OP and uses independent subkeys. It was popularly
used in the application "Stuffit" for the Macintosh until it was
replaced by a weaker XOR system on Stuffit 3.0.

As has been pointed out, differential cryptanalysis made the subkey
issue virtually moot.

I'm not sure where you have gotten that impression.  I have read a
great deal of the literature, and have never heard anyone refer to the
problem of "finding roots" by the name "discrete logarithms".  I have
only seen "discrete logarithm" refer to finding, for integers x and n,
and generator g, an integer k such that g^k = x (mod n).

On the other hand, this is false.  If the modulus n is prime, then
there are well-known algorithms for finding square roots.  However,
noone knows how to compute discrete logs modulo a prime number (and
in fact, some crypto systems depend on this for security).  Also, given
the prime factorization of n, you can compute square roots --- but I
don't think you can compute the discrete log under those conditions.

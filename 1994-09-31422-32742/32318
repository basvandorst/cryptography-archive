It's beautiful.  just beautiful.  

I don't think RSA's that _smart_ (if they were, they'd hire engineers
instead of lawyers)... but it's still elegant as _hell_.

To note again what I said a few posts ago... unless someone can prove that
the code is substantially RSA's, there's nothing to prove that someone
who wrote it actually possessed a copy of RSA's...

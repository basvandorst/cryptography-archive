The poster appears to be making a beginners' mistake here!
He is incorrectly using the term "board" to mean "Usenet newsgroup", as is
clear from the use of the word "poster", and what he says is true of Usenet. 
However, the poster to whom he is replying was using the term "board" 
(correctly) for a dial-up bulletin board system, of which it is not true.

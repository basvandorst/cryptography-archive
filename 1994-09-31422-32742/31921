A quick follow-up.  VOTPCRYP turns out to be unusually susceptible to a
known plaintext attack, which works like this: assume you know the first N
bytes of the file (any N bytes will do, but things are slightly simpler if
you have the first few).  For all possible starting positions of the first
2 tapes (256 * 255 choices), figure out what value of the third tape would
produce the first character of crib:

	value = crib[0] ^ tape0[ptr0] ^ tape1[ptr1] ^ ciphertext[0]

Look this value up in an inverted file of tape2[] -- this works because
each tape is a permutation of integers 0-255 -- and use this setting to
position the third tape.

Then run the encryption as usual, checking that subsequent plaintext
characters match the crib.

I find that for the challenge cipher, N=3 bytes of crib narrows the list
of successful matches down to three winners (few enough to check by hand)
and N=4 bytes of crib gives the unambiguous correct solution.

This attack takes a couple of seconds rather than a couple of minutes by
reducing the keysearch from 24 bits to 16 bits.

I'm not a lawyer, but I don't think they have any claim against the people
who received the code innocently.  On the other hand, in the world of
tangible goods, isn't it a crime to receive and distribute stolen goods,
even if you weren't involved in the original theft and weren't aware that
the goods were stolen?  By analogy, wouldn't the same be true of
intellectual property?

a) When that "someone who signed a non-disclosure" described the algorithm
to the person who wrote the code, he was presumably violating his NDA.  He
(and probably also his employer) can probably be sued.

b) Is presumably a license and/or copyright violation.

c) Software products are often accompanied by licenses, which often
prohibit reverse-engineering.  Whether these are enforceable probably
depends on the situation (most people believe shrink-wrap licenses are not
valid, for instance).

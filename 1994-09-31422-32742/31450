The speed difference isn't surprising.  Mike Morgan reported his 39
KBytes/sec max speed was on a 33MHz 386SX.  (I didn't know there was
such a machine).

A 486 is commonly 2 to 2.5 times the speed of a 386 at the same clock
rate, and a "fast" 486 can now be up to 100 MHZ.  So that gives the
486 a factor of 6 or so.  The DES's that run at this speed are all
highly tuned assembler, which is worth a factor of maybe 2 or 3,
over c, depending on the tuner and compiler.

I agree Blowfish is intrinsicly fast.  (On one Sparc and various MIPS
machines I got .65 to 2.68 Megabytes/sec with C.)  Bruce did an
excellent job choosing operations which seem to add as much complexity
as possible in minimal time.

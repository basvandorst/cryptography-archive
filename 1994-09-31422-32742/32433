                           Sidewinder:
               Internet Security That Strikes Back

The Internet is a dangerous place. Ask anyone.  

     * Between 85-97% of all computer break-ins go undetected.
     * Industrial espionage is up 400% since the late 1980's. 
     * Hacker attacks increase exponentionally: 
     * Over 1 million computer break-ins last year alone.
     *  Theft of confidential information costs billions  to  Am
erica's financial infrastructure 
     * Privacy is almost nonexistent.

Yet, the Internet is the fastest growing segment of the  National 
Information Infrastructure.  Over 20 million users and businesses 
conduct  global affairs on the Internet today, and over 125  mil
lion will by the year 2000.  

Join  us  to  witness the technological  breakthrough  in  inter-
networking which finally makes the Internet a safe place to be.  


              The future of the Internet is secure. 
                          Come see how.

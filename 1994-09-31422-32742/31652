I couldn't pass this one up, since you work at Mitre and you flame.  You
should know better than most that most problems don't scale that
way...especially when $$ is concerned.  Or hardware (the incomplete
sentence is deliberate.)  There are costs connected with the interprocess
communication that would be required to throw large quantities of CPU's at
a large factoring problem, for example.  Note that this is perhaps
different than an exhaustive keysearch problem where the key space could
be eaily partitioned beforehand, requiring no IPC.  Anyway, it's a lot
more subtle than you indicate ... certainly not 1/n.  If you're going to
flame, at least be impeccable.

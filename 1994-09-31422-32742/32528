Indeed, and you can use the same method yourself if your card issuer
does not let you change the number.  Just subtract the number you want
from the real number, and write the result on the back of your card.
Then when entering the number, add the memorised number to the one on
the card.  Do the addition and subtraction without carry: it's
insecure otherwise (consider as an extreme example the case where 9999
is written on the card - the real number must be 9999) and it's
easier.

Ooooh!  I didn't know we had a king.  I thought we were an
autonomous collective.

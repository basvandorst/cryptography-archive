My problems with PGP > 2.4 is the limitation of key length.  I also DO 
NOT trust RSA worth spit.  They obtained this mysterious air-tight patent 
on ALL Public Key cryptosystems, which is wholly ridiculous.  It's 
AWWWFULLY convenient for a single "company" to be the GateKeeper of this 
"secure" cryptographic technology.  It's even more CONVENIENT that 
Skipjack/Clipper was "bogus" enough to be found inferior by non-spooks, 
thus driving the herds to RSA like cattle.  Oh so fucking convenient.  
Mysterious patent, paid for with generous grants to MIT, Stanford, et 
al.  I don't like it people.  Fuck RSA.  These people are dangeous.  
Write your own math libs, use 4k bits as a base, don't trust your life to 
RSA-supplied binaries.  Why give away your peace of mind or security?

My rule with slime like NSA/NRO.....  take the largest key length you can 
conceive of 1000 of the most expensive computers built could attack, and 
multiply it by four.  This will provide a reasonable basis for security.
Anything less is childish.

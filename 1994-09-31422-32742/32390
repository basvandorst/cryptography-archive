     Doesn't work that way.  If you invent something, keep the technology
a secret, and base a product on it, one year after the first offer to sell
the product you lose the right to patent the invention.  On the other
hand, your secret technology doesn't count as prior art against a new
application because it isn't publicly-available knowledge.  

      The rules are deliberately set up so you can't keep something a 
trade secret and years later patent it.

All the talk in sci.crypt about the legalities of using and/or
posting the recently-posted "RC4" code, the warning that David
Sternlight was so kind as to post (apparently on behalf of Jim
Bidzos), and all the other greatly-extended discussions of who
violated what rights in which piece of code have one
_very_important_ thing in common:

           They have little or nothing to do with the
           SCIENCE or the TECHNOLOGY of cryptology, and
           hence do not belong on sci.crypt.

Please, folks, can we improve the signal-to-noise ratio
on this newsgroup, and talk about legalities having to
do with computing in a more appropriate place, such as
misc.legal.computing or talk.politics.crypto?

Followups directed to misc.legal.computing.

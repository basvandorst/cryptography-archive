And you are WRONG.  You can copyright trade secrets (well, the specific
instantiation of trade secreted code).  You can even register the copyright.

Wrong.  Listen very carefully:  you can register copyrighted code by sending
just the first portion, and the last portion.  (I forget the number of lines
required, but it's something like 50.  So a total of 100 lines, maybe.)
When you do that, the ENTIRE WORK is copyrighted, and registered as such,
and you are entitled to full civil and criminal protections.  All without
disclosing the trade secret portions.

If your trade secret code is too small, throw in a whole slew of comments or
unrelated code at the beginning and end, and then send those in for
registration.

Got that?

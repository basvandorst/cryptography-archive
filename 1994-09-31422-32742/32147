Well, I can think of two really good packages that just happen to
be absolutely free! Isn't that wonderfull?

 #1 PGP 2.6.1. ftp net-dist.mit.edu. cd /pub/PGP/README. read it.
follow it's instructions.

 #2 SFS. DOS Secure file system. Don't know off the top of my head
where to get it. Use Archie -s "SFS".

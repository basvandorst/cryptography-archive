IMHO a proof that inverting RSA is as hard as factoring would not be
too surprizing, but I don't think anyone expects a proof that
factoring is super-polynimial any time soon.  It would resolve the
P=NP? question which everyone works on and no one answers.  Even
proving that factoring is NP hard is unlikely, since it would resolve
the NP=Co-NP? questions, which is another of the great unsolved
problems.

We are left with the situation that breaking RSA is at most as hard as
factoring, and may be easier; factoring is at most NP hard and may be
easier, and NP hard may still be tractable.

Just speaking for myself, I would be more surprized by a proof that
factoring is super-poly-time than by a poly-time factoring algorithm.

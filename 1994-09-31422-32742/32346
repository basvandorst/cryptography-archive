Interesting theory, but it seems not to be true.  In fact, what is coming
out is the the government never gave a tinker's damn whether or not RC4
was public or not.  RSADSI wanted the algorithm secret.

If "at the other end a recipient may drop in a longer-key version of RC4,"
the same recipient can just as easily drop in DES, triple-DES, IDEA, of
whatever else he wanted to.

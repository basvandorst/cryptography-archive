Yes, there are also other implementations capable of 1024-bit RSA in 50ms (typical)
assuming +/- 50% of the 1024 bits in the exponent are set. (+- 20Kbits/sec 1024bit RSA)

HOWEVER, the question in the original posting was:

ASSUMING 512 bit exponentiation IS AVAILABLE in hardware, what techniques are there
to accelerate ENCRYPTION using 1024 modulii.

	eg: use hardware to peform 512 bit multiply, 
	    and do modulo reducion in software

Decryption would be processed using the 512 bit p,q and u values. 

Any ideas?

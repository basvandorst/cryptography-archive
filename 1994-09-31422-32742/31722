OK... this should be the last post.

RE: Picking n=PQ and P,Q either primes or of the form:

  p*q where p and q are primes and:

   p=420b+1, q=840b+1

(not hard to do)

if n=PQ.. I mentioned that the prob. that P or Q is of that format (and
passes k levels of Miller-Rabin or Fermat with randomly chosen items...
and they do pass for 2,3,5,7 in Fermat) is:

   (with n=PQ) >>c(k)/[n^.25*ln(n)^2]

But, if we want it to work under PGP then we need, if one passes, the
other to pass, be a prime, or something like a Carmichael... if that is
on the order of 1/ln(n) the prob. that one gets either a P or Q
factorable and passes (for P,Q Fermat test... 2,3,5,7 and k tests on
Miller-Rabin or Fermat, randomly chosen items) about >>c(k)/[n^.25*ln(n)^3].

So if it passes, then the prob that it is not n=PQ (P,Q being prime) is
no better (in this discussion) that having a lower bound of (the above
relative to the prob. it is prime, that is, 1/ln(n)]:

  >> c(k)/[n^.25*ln(n)^2]

(extra factor of ln(n) in the denominator)

Of course such a factor is negligible compared to the factor of n^.25
that Hal pointed out I had missed.

(while these do not show up if you use the standard way of getting PGP
parameters... they are pretty easy to make up... like, while finding
numbers which are randomly powers of primes and has, say, K bits... if
you just look at a random K bit number, this is unlikely... but easy to
force, if you just take a prime and raise it to the proper power).

So.. you can create weak PGP type systems, if you want... it seems that
PGP is not likely to do so.

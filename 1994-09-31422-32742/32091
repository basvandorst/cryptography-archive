Do you think that decompiling code is covered by the 3426.1 provisions on
reverse engineering? Does it look to you from your reading of the original
Cypherpunks or newsgroup posting that the code is question is the product of
a decompiler, or is stolen source code? Note that this is not an attempt to
entrap anyone--last time I looked, reading itself wasn't illegal as far as
this non-attorney knows. :-)

What about RSADSI's copyright in the code? That's separate from any
protection they might have under trade secrets law.

I agree with you about the Federal felony charges and associated jail time
if a conviction is obtained being by far the more serious issue. Note that
there are probably conspiracy and aiding charges the Feds might think of
with respect to those who republish. Maybe even throw in some RICO as well?
Note also that EACH export of an ITAR-covered item requires its own license.
Thus those who republish are certainly available for Federal attention.

A few months back I read an article in Science News about the possibility that 
factoring and other NP sorts of problems might be solvable by "magic" - by 
building a device based on quantum physical principles that forces a solution 
by wave-function collapse. Apparently someone proved that either such a 
solution exists (in theory if not in practice) or standard interpretations of 
quantum mechanics are wrong.

Does anyone have any comments on this? Pointers to on-line info?

Thanks in advance

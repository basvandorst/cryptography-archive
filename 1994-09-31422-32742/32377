The last time I bothered paying attention (since prosecutability of most
of this for non-commercial use is practically nil) those agreements were
HIGHLY questionable as legally binding agreements... there have been 
rulings every which way, and it's going to depend on what circuit of the
federal court system the case is heard, what particular judge, etc., etc.

I missed the original to this, but *highly* recommend CRYPTOGRAPHY: A NEW 
DIMENSION IN DATA SECURITY by Matyas & Meyer (Wiley).
It's written by people that developed DES in the first place, and has an 
extensive tutorial on stream and block ciphers, and how to use DES as 
various kinds of stream ciphers. I used it to develop my own DES, 
tripleDES and IDEA code.

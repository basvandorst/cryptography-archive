And "Efficient Exponentiation using Precomputation and Vector Addition
Chains", by Peter de Rooij (me, sorry for plugging myself:-),
Eurocrypt'94. (Preproceedings only, proceedings to appear.) Also
describes something similar to Brickell et al, but with much smaller
tables, and somewhat slower. I haven't read Lim and Lee's paper yet, as
I wasn't at Crypto, so I can't tell you the difference (yet). Contact
me for further info.

Peter.

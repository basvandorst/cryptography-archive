I think the CD-ROM is really the weak link, here, unless you or your 
customers destroy them properly.  Smashing one with a hammer and throwing 
it in the trash leaves you open to a master puzzle maker attack.  The 
reconstruction, would, no doubt, result in errors along the cracks, but 
that leaves lots of plain text exposed, still.  Burning or grinding might 
work.  This sounds messy compared to degaussing a magnetic tape and 
possibly reusing it.  Just how much does a 0.25" tape drive sell for, 
these days?  Maybe $400 to $600 for a 750 Megabyte drive, and you could 
write your own tapes.  Just sell the hardware rng, a pair of tape drives, 
and the software to manage it.  You could even erase small sections of 
tape after use.

Software piracy is made illegal by federal law, and NOT by the presence or 
absence of any shrink-wrap agreement on the package.


As far as I know, reverse engineering is NOT covered by such law.  RSADSI 
may be able to claim that an employee is an agent of an employer, and that 
the employer is responsible for the employees actions, but there are many 
other situations in which this claim cannot be made.

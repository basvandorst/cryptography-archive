From your interpretation, a trade secret that leaks is effectively patented.
Given that anyone might stumble across it on netnews, it's almost impossible
that someone could clean-room it--in fact, what would be entailed in "clean
room"ing it is not well defined as it would be for copyright claims.

As for your complaint that many employees could to nasty things to their
employers without getting caught--WHAT ELSE IS NEW?  Seriously, anyone who
has ever been in any even moderately advanced position anywhere would have
the possibility to do some major damage to their employer were they so
inclined.  Of course, most employees aren't so inclined and most employers
try to keep it that way, but consider:

 -1- In many shops, from my experience, employees have read access to most
     other employee's files within the same department; getting data would
     not be hard.  Leaking this data to a competitor without making it
     public would be just as nasty in most cases as publicizing it (and in
     some cases financially rewarding as well).
 -2- Were someone responsible for manufacturing something (even just mass
     producing disks for that matter) malicious they could easily introduce
     defects to sabotage the company's reputation.  Even those whose normal
     job would not include such production could probably still sneak in
     some defects--often in such a way as to make someone else "look" guilty.

There are many ways employees can damage their employers.  But equating trade
secrets with patents just to prevent one of them is not logical.

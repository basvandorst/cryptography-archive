It isn't well known, and it has never been previously published.  Effectively,
RSA Data Security achieved with RC4 what the NSA is trying to achieve
with Skipjack.  Their secret algorithm has become a de facto standard without
any public review and comment.

Of course, but profits are better served by making an algorithm secret
and forcing consumers to buy it.  And if NSA gives you a monopoly by making
it easier to export products with your algorithm and no other, so much
the better.

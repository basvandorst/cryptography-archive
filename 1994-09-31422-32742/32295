Simply appalling.I though that after the past complaints about your reading
comprehension you would have taken a course or two. Apparently not.  Reverse
is specifically exempted from improper means. If it is accompanied by
other improper means it does not nullify those others but I never said
it did. I simply said that in and of itself reverse engineering was not
improper means. 
To Repeat We Do not know that this code was released by improper means.
Your statement that it was is simply "proof by blatant assertion". Jim
Bidsos has not posted here, and he does not state that it was obtained
by improper means. He simply states that the code was a trade secret
which RSA took very seriously, and that they will try to discover how it
was realesed, and will use the law to the full extent applicable. He
clearly does not know how it was released. he does not even call on the
community not to use this code, except by implication.  For you to state
that we should all know that this code was released by improper means,
and therefor fall under the restrictions of the trade secrets act and
furthermore might be in danger of prosecution if use this code is shall
we say a leap unsupported by argument.
 
 We all know that RSA regarded this as a trade secret. We do not know
 how or by whom the code was released. We do not know whether or not RSA
 took sufficient pains to ensure that the trade secret remained secret.
 Since we do not know who released the code we do not know whether they
 were under any duty to RSA to preserve the secret, whether by
 employment or implicit or explicit legal obligation. Since we know
 nothing about the person, we cannot know. Perhaps Bidsos acciddentally
 left a folder containing the code lying on the seat of the subway one
 day. Not that I am saying that he was the source of the leak- it is
 just to illustrate that we have absolutely no knowledge of how it was
 realeased and thus cannot know that it was released improperly. It is
 not sufficient under the law that it might have been released
 improperly. One must know or have reason to know that it WAS released
 improperly. We do not have that knowledge, and nothing that either you
 (or Bidsos through you) has said has increased our knowledge in that
 area. At present it is all speculation, which has no standing as far as
 I know in court of law.

 To give another argument,
 the license from Lotus is a license between Lotus and the consumer, not
 between RSA and the consumer. Thus anythign said by Lotus in their
licence can not be used by RSA as demonstrating that RSA trade secret
 was violated by improper means (except perhaps by Lotus itself for
 not taking sufficient care to preserve RSA's secret).

Usual disclaimer- I am not a lawyer, so my legal advice is worth even
less than what you have paid for it. However, at last report,
Stearnlight is also not a lawyer . If it matters to you, seek competent
legal advice.

I need a program that can lock specific directories on an MS-Dos Pc. 
Something that prompts you for a password when you type cd dirname. I 
know its possible 'coz there is a program that can do it (and many other 
things) but it is going for well over a thousand Sing. $. Any info on an 
ftp site carrying somthing like this will be appreciated.

Thanks

The PK people might be surprised to know that known plaintext isn't hard
to come by in actual practice.  For example, if Paul were trying to break
a ZIP-encrypted C program, he might look for common C strings like
"\n#include <stdio.h>\n" or "\nmain(argc, argv)\nint argc;\nchar *argv[];\n"
and its ANSIfied variations.  If it's a newer version of an older program,
then whole subroutines are likely to be available.

The crypto history of WW2 is stiff with examples of breaks due to known
plaintext.  Code clerks might forward a message in the new system to
someone who doesn't have the old system.  A spy in the UK might encrypt
a verbatim speech to send back home.  There were examples where the
recipient said "Unable to decrypt -- re-send using last month's keys." and
the sender complied.  Some code clerks would test each new system with the
same set of folk songs.

A modern crypto-system must be secure against not only known plaintext, but
the more stringent chosen plaintext attack... viz. the famous Midway example.

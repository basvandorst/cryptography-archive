Actually, it's quite common to require NDA's as part of beta-test
agreements.  The intent there is to prohibit the tester from disclosing
anything they might learn about the software while testing it.  This would
include trade secrets they learn by reverse-engineering the software (and
the beta-test agreement usually mentions reverse-engineering explicitly).

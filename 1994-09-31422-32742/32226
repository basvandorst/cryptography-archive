Maybe.  Maybe not.  It doesn't matter.  I have decided not to post it for 
the moment.  It was rather educational to experiment with it, however.  
What DOES "immunize" me from PART of the good ideas in RC-4 are my 
records dating back to November 1993, where I recorded independent 
invention of a stream cipher that was similar in many ways to RC-4.  
After looking at RC-4 for a while, I think that my cipher was more 
secure, anyway.  For example, it doesn't suffer from the short/long key 
equivalence problem that RC-4 has, and the output from very slightly 
dissimilar keys diverges much faster with my Brand X.  I would post that 
code on an appropriate export controlled site, but I need to get 
clearance on some intellectual property issues, first.  Not everyone who 
posts here is an anarchist.  :-)

Peace to you.

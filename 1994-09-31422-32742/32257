And... if someone thinks their secrets are SECURE, simply because it's
"not fair" to disassemble it... they have much to learn in our world
of technology.

Surely, they don't protect their trade secrets, by placing them in a
filing cabinet in their parking lot with a "do not read" sign attached.

Let's get real... if the algorithm is embodied in the object code...
sooner or later, someone will read the object code... I guess if you
were trained at it, you could disassemble it in your head.

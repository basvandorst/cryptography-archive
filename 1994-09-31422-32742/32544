As I read the article, it is the WSJ, not Bidzos, who say Customs and FBI
are investigating.

As for your substantive point, does the FBI investigate trade secrets
violations of this kind? Does the customs service? If it comes to that, is
trade secrets law Federal?

If the answer to any of the above questions is "no" then it is a reasonable
conclusion for an intelligent reader that they are investigating ITAR/Export
Control violations.

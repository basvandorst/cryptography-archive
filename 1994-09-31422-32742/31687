Maybe, if I ever have time... :-)  IDEA really hasn't been looked 
at as closely as one might like...

Yes.  It's reasonably easy to run the cipher backwards, and one 
can do this all the way to the beginning of the pseudorandom 
header.  The state at that point can then be used to decrypt 
other files encrypted with the same password.

Although I haven't written code to do this yet, it should also 
be possible to keep going backward to find the text of shorter 
passwords.  (Longer passwords can't be determined uniquely since 
multiple passwords will lead to the same state.)

Cheers,

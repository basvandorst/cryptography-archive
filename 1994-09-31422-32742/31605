Then why do have a PGP public key in the keyserver network:

	Type bits/keyID    Date       User ID
	pub  1010/E0460F7D 1994/03/20 Iolo Davidson <wandering@large>

I would argue that no matter how efficient the NSA's "magic
spectacles" are, the more ciphertext moving over public networks, the
more of a hassle it is for them to sift through it all.  This is a
reason to encrypt everything, including non-sensitive information.

In fact, even if factoring has NP-complete complexity and NP != P, the
NSA has some "magic spectacles" that are not terribly efficient but
which will almost always succeed in cracking a single person's
cryptosystem: they simply gain access to your computer without your
knowledge and subvert your cryptosystem.

So unless you run PGP on a Newton that hangs from a chain through your
nose, they have the access they need.  But my above argument applies
here as well: the more people who encrypt, the more expensive (in
time, people, and money) it is for them to subvert everyone's
cryptosystem.

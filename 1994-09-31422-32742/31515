   It seems that the question at hand is 'what is a decent level of security?'.

Decent for what?  Until you've answered that, your question is almost
unanswerable.  Decent security to keep you young children out of you
diary is rather different from that to keep GCHQ out of your phone
calls.  Or perhaps not ...  8-)

   The RSA 129-bit trick that Bellcore pulled off took a great deal of thought

129-digits, actually, or about 425 bits.

   before the task was even started; then it took quite a few people and many
   machines a decent amount of time to decode a simple sentence.  Did anyone
   collect the $100?  I haven't heard.

Yeah, we collected the check from Ron Rivest.  The cash was donated to
the Free Software Foundation.  Full-color photocopies were sent free
to anyone who took part in the project and asked for one.  I've got a
greatly-enlarged one framed on my wall at home.

Stuff deleted.

   I have no doubt that 512/768 will be broken within a decade, given the notice

512-bits within a decade, certainly.  Watch this space.  768-bits I
rather doubt will happen this century, though I'd love to be proved wrong.

   So...I make a key with 1024 bits to tell my wife, "I love you".  A key with

Kilobit keys are more than sufficient for that.  I suspect that
300-bit keys would be adequate; 512-bits certainly so.

   65536 on my resume...and when I plot to overthrow the world...a kazillion
   bit key (just kidding Mr. NSA!).

Given that 1024-bit keys are currently unbreakable, by many orders of
magnitude, I'd say you were over-reacting.

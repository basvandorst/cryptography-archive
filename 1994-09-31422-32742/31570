     I don't have anything to add to the discussion of the general
strengths or weaknesses of cellular automata, but this particular application
suffers from the dimensions of the matrix.  The Passphrase was written
repeatedly into the matrix to fill it.  Since each row is an integer number
of bytes long, the bits corresponding to the seldom used characters above
ascii 127 and the bits corresponding to the upper/lower case switch (usually
set to lower case) would form neat vertical columns.
     These patterns would undoubtedly appear in the output of subsequent
generations and simplify cryptanalysis.  Perhaps that's one reason PC's
lawyers got permission to export it (the article mentions legal problems).
     *If* Life is a useful system, it should be implemented so that adjacent
rows are offset by at least three bits (or by scrambling the input some way).
A 67 by 62 bit array should generate the 4,096 bits needed for the 512 byte
key used by WinCrypt with a few bits left over.

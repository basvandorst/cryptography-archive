To date, what is deemed the most powerful encyrption method available, i.e.
the most difficult to attack and break? Please include numbers (for example
DES has 2^64 possible combinations, or something like that...it's been awhile
since I checked) Also, please include either info on making the code or
reference materials.

Thanks,

Dani

[stuff about shrink-wrap agreements omitted]

As a matter of interest I am in an e-mail discussion with an attorney about
this. The current state of play of what court decisions exist seem to
indicate that if there is no notice on the outside of the box or with the
transaction, it is a sale, and cannot be converted into a license by
material inside the box.

But if there is an appropriate notice on the outside of the box, it is not a
sale. I grabbed a box at random (the new Symantec Norton Utilities for the
Mac) and there's a notice on the outside:

"Use of this product is subject to acceptance of the Symantec License
Agreement included in this package."

I think that probably does the job until the next court case, and if RSADSI
had insisted on anything similar, or Lotus had put such a thing on, say
Lotus Notes boxes on their own initiative, then the agreement would apply.

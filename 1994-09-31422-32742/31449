    As far as I know, the whole RSA cryptosystem is based on the
Euler's theorem that for each x and a which are relatively prime
(i.e. gcd(x,a)=1)

        x^phi(n)=1 (mod n)   , where phi is the Euler's function

    In the RSA cryptosystem x is the plaintext and n is the key
modulus, being a multiple of two primes p and q.

    My question is: what if x accidentally becomes NOT relatively
prime with n? Would the system work? Maybe if would be easy to find
the value of x?
    All RSA implementations which I've seen never check for such a
condition.

    I understand that due to the choice of n=pq the probability of x
being not relatively prime with n is pretty low. Maybe it is low
enough to be ignored completely?

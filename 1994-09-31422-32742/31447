1. This is false. If you followed the discussion last month you will have
seen that such accusations were both false and refuted. They are the same
kind of cheap propaganda assertion without proof you are making.

2. This is irrelevant. The discussion wasn't about economics but about the
degree of mathematicization appropriate to answer a lay person's question.
Thus your comment is not only wrong, but also malicious. I think this meets
the dictionary definition of a jerk.

Of what possible relevance is that to the matter under discussion?

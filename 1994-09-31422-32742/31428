Yes, I understand that, my question was isn't only one round "too
few"? It seems to me that it could be reversed by brute force. True,
there will be more than one solution, but still, the real solution
will be found too. Isn't one of the required properties of the
cryptographically strong hashes that the attacker shouldn't be able to
find (easily) two messages that yeld the same hash?

On the other hand, 3 (or maybe even 2) rounds make the brute force
search difficult enough, while in the same time do not seem to be "too
many", in the sense that the initial configuration will die out.
Still, they could result in "too many zeroes"...

Vesselin

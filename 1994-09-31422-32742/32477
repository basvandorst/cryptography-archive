The Fairfax conference is the the ACM Conference on Computer and
Communications Security, held in Fairfax, Virginia, in early November.
Last year was the first for that conference.

As for CDMF -- it's the Commerical Data Masking Facility; IBM is too
honest to call something with 40 bits of key strength an encryption
algorithm.  It's DES-based, because the strengths (and weaknesses)
of DES are well known at this point.  I don't recall the exact details,
but the steps are something like take a 56-bit input key (because
all of their key management software is built for DES keys), do a
one-way hash based on DES, mask down to 40 bits, and do another DES-
based hash.  The resulting key is used for ordinary DES.  As I recall,
the point of the one-way hashes is to prevent recovery of the input keys
even after cracking a session key.  See the full paper for details.

I have no idea if there's an expedited export approval process for
CDMF; however, it was explicitly intended for the export market.  I'm
pretty sure it's patented by IBM.

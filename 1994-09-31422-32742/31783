The Clipper Chip is a microelectronic encrytion chip that implements the
Escrowed Encryption Standard (EES), the government's new encryption standard
for voice, fax, and data transmitted through the phone system.  The EES
specifies a classified algorithm called SKIPJACK, which provides strong
security for communications, and a Law Enforcement Access Field (LEAF)
creation method, which permits authorized government officials access to those
communications under a court order.  The talk will describe the EES, its
objectives, how it works, and some of the issues that have been raised.

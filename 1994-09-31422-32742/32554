The FBI can and will investigate any crime or possible crime which crosses or
may cross state lines.

There is no evidence to support the contention that who reverse-engineered 
(or stole) RC4 violated ITAR, unless you consider posting the algorithm to the
net without a "Distribution:usa" modifier to be exporting.  I seriously doubt
the spooks would try to make that one stick, though, as there is this little
thing known as the First Amendment....  RC4, after all, is NOT classified.

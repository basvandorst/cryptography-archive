Indiskreet is is much less secure than SD or SFS.
I think that a rundown of its weaknesses are in the SFS
documentation; if not, they appear here from time to time.

Indiskreet is not pathetic the way that Word Perfect encryption is, 
but there is no question that a determined attacker with resources
could break it.  Among other things, its strongest mode uses single
DES encryption in a rather weak way.

I am paraphrasing, but as I read it, the law basically said, 
"reverse-engineering is not improper means".  

If code was stolen, and then reverse-engineered, then it is the theft and 
not the reverse-engineering that makes it improper means.  If a valid 
license, contract or NDA was broken and code was reverse engineered, then 
it is the breaking of the agreement and not the reverse engineering that 
implies improper means.  Is there some scenario that you are postulating 
where reverse-engineering, not in combination with something else that by 
itself would be considered improper means would be sufficient?  If not, 
then why even bring reverse-engineering into it?  It simply isn't 
relevant at all, according to the law you quoted a few messages back.

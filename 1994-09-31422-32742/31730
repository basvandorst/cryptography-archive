That was partially the idea of a commercial OTP, obviously people
Really concerned with security will know not to trust the
source of a OTP, but it is more secure than commercial-code based
products.  In the literature it describes very clearly that
the pad should not be re-used and describes how to physically
destroy the pad(quoted right out of the DoD manual) and why these steps are 
important. Personally, I have no need for a OTP, and my advertisements
actually say "you probabally dont need a OTP but here is what it is"
not a very good sales pitch, ubt it is not a high sales item,
mostly something to start discussion that peopel can say Wow about.

I agree mag tape is better in a lot of respects, but many people
do not have a magtape reader, and it is much easier to handle and store
something mething like a cdrom for most people(non tech types) and 
many people do not have the ability to generate a random data file
and that is what the price really goes for, that equipment and time.

There is a written gurauntee that there is no cpy made, whatever that
is worth, local people do have the option of watching the creation
process, but then what gurauntee does Norton or Central Point
really provide, they have a good name to protect but how can
anyone really prove that there are no backdoors in any commercial
product.  I would say my OTP is at least a trustworthy as anything
commercially available without source code, so anyone buying it is
not really getting screwed, they get what they pay for and everything
is explained including procedures and weaknesses(ie someone copying
the pad or reuse) and how it works, that is a lot more than I have ever 
gotten with any commercial package I have evaluated.

Just a little more than 10 years ago, some computer designers
thought no one would ever need more than 640k of memory too
times change rapidly

>Faster machines will make that more practical.  
>Why are you inaccuately badmouthing the competition?
Not everyone uses 1024bit keys, I have seen many use 512bit, and
in the future faster machines will make more complex encryption
much more feasable and secure, but the mail you send today encrypted at 
512bits could possibly be decrypted in 10 years. I beleive it has been posted
many times about the $10Million dollar machine to decrypt DES, what 
do you thinnk a dual pentium 100Mhz SVGA w/ 10Gigs of hard drive would have
been worth 10 years ago? That $10Million dollar machine might become feasable
at tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars in 10 years.  What you DES 
encrypt today could conceivably be decrypted in 10 years, but obviously 
the files you encrypt in 10 years will not be so easily decrypted.
 Mail encrypted with a OTP today will never be decrypted once the OTP is 
destroyed(on both ends)

That is a good idea, perhaps ver2.0 will include something similar,

That is my recommendation, I dont use anything that does not
include the source code.

Anyone that is going to buy a OTP from om a commercial establishment
will not likely be able to do spectral measurements, if they
have that type of resources and know-how they can make 
their own.


Anyone reading this group is well past the level of th eperson that
would even consider buying a OTP, my product is aimed at those that
need high security but are not willing to put a lot of time into
studying cryptography, but know enough not to trust commercial packages,
maybe they just want to say "hey, we use a one time pad, real hush hush".
It is really a better conversation point than a security item, it does
have some limited uses and if combined with DES or some other encyrption
it is very secure.  My usual recommendations for security are
secure device/drive PGP, RSA, and DES(CBC,CFB)
A OTP is really not practical for most uses, unless I made one myself
I would not trust a pad either.

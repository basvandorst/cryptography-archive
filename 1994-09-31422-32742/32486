It's also had a piece on it in this weeks new scientist
Basically instead of a serial approch eg
is n a factor if no n++ begin again
it does (for a 16 bit register)
which of the numbers 0-2^16 is a factor of n?
It does this by some serious wierdness which AIUI basically for this case
uses 2^16 parrallel universes to do the calculation, with the results all
interfering to give the answer. 
If this technology does work out (and it's at the very leat 5 years away)
then it means that RSA is no longer secure, as it can be cracked 
in seconds or milliseconds (it depends on the noise, you might only get
the right answer once in every 10^6 tries, but averaging can get you the
real result) no matter what keylength you use. I suspect that this 
technology might well also be applicable to any other cipher, IDEA, DES
RD4 etc so if it does work you'r attempts at privacy are useless against
any opponent with one of these machines.
(the machines themselves are built with gates only 10 atoms across or so
a memory cell in these can be switched to 1 by a short pulse of laser
light, but if you only hit it with half the required energy it goes into
a state where it contains both a 1 and a 0 and this is the function 
exploited.)

David:
	You made sweeping generalized statements about the use of RC4 being
criminal.  He simply stated that your all inclusive statement was not really
all inclusive.  As far as your posts are concerned, most of them do not even
apply to _me_, as I live in Maryland, USA.  
	You also (previously) stated that RC4 use was stated by Mr. Bidzos as
being illegal.  You defended yourself with a technicality of wording.  I
responded that in the same technical fashion, RSADSI never stated which
program was illegally released.  In the same fashion as you, mind you.  Your
response that I should treat my words with a lack of precision, but you may
treat other's words to more exacting standards is uncalled for and nit picky.

Not another self-righeous European, who take an obviously U.S. discussion
out of context in order to do some American-bashing!

I'll bet the law circumscribes the uses to which the decompilation may be
put. I'll make a wild guess that it does not permit subsequent publication
of the decompiled code in order to vitiate a trade secret.

Depends on what was done with the decompilation, I'll venture to suggest.

We're talking ITAR here, which is U.S. law. UK export law has no relevance
to whether posting to a board in the US, under US law, constitutes export if
the board is known to be transmitted overseas automatically.

An important point here is that though it seems to European readers as if
THEY import the contents of boards they read (if the poster is in the U.S.)
what actually happens is that the messages are sent to Europe and stored on
various European computers before anyone there reads them--hence exported.
Same with mailing lists, which are exported automatically before you read
your mail from them in Europe. Thus when you post to a board like sci.crypt,
or to a mailing list like Cypherpunks, YOU are exporting. You could no more
argue that you weren't than you could that if you mailed a package to
Europe, it was the Post Office exporting, not you.

We're not talking Brazil here, but U.S. law applied in the U.S.

The NSA can conclude anything it likes. In this case it can also
_legitimately_ conclude that U.S. law has been broken (see above).

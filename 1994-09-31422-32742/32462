I got some email from someone saying the NSA had allowed prefixing
the 40 bit key with a longer "salt" that had to be transmitted
in the clear.

What is CDMF?  Does this mean munging 40 bit strings into DES keys
in a particular way is eligible for the same fast-track export
approval as RC2/RC4?  What is the Fairfax conference?  tnx.

The National Computer Security Association (NCSA) operates a 
forum on CompuServe which is dedicated to InfoSecurity.  It can 
be reached by CompuServe users via GO NCSA.

Within this CompuServe forum, NCSA maintains a private section 
devoted to export restricted software, including PGP.  Access to 
the section is governed by a procedure which is outlined in file 
PGP.TXT and can be found in public library 6 of the NCSA forum.

FYI, other sections of the NCSA InfoSecurity forum address topics 
such as Viruses, Telco/PBX fraud, computer crime/law, audit, 
disaster recovery, ethics/privacy, PC/LAN security, UNIX/InterNet 
security, as well as a section devoted to reviews of many 
security-related books.

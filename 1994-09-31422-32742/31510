If the sublime is unobtainable why not the ridiculous :-)


Look at it this way-- some mathematical wizards would be prepared to stake 
their lives on the security of PGP yet beyond repeated statements about
the difficulty of factoring 1024 bit numbers do not seem to have any
meaningful mathematical statements about its level of reliabilty.

Does this mean they are sure that , apart from factoring, there is no
reliable decryption method (if so why?)
or that mathematicians are willing candidates for russian roulette?


What reliance can be placed on the idea that no alternative method of
decryption is likely to exist?

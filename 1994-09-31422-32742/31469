Summary: Would using two seperate 1-way-hash functions be much more secure?

This may be an issue already addressed, but I don't have time to go through
500 or so messages...

   For those people who worry about people signing a document and then
substituting a different document for it later that has the same hash
value, wouldn't it make sense to use two seperate hash functions? If you
have two 128 bit 1-way-hash algorithms, seperately they have a "Birthday"
solution of 2^64, but together they have 2^128. I mean, the chances are
already very slim that two messages will have the same MD5 value, but
two messages having the same MD5 *and* the same MD4 (or the moral equivilent)
are so slim as to be negligable.

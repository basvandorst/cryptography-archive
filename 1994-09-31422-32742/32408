I am posting this request for a student of mine. Her name is 
Deborah Stone and she is a sophomore majoring in Math at the 
University of Delaware. She is interested in a summer job for 
1995, doing work in cryptography/data security. She is considering 
theoretical as well as technical and computer work. She would most 
prefer the New Jersey area, although travel to other areas is no problem.

For leads or ideas, please contact either her at stoney@brahms.udel.edu 
or myself. Please do not post responses on this newsgroup.

Thanks.

If you like the word "puzzle" better than "problem" for this, ok, it's
an interesting crypto puzzle.  A comparable puzzle is how the check
digits on U. S. drivers licenses are computed (they vary from one
state to another).  A year or so ago (I don't have the reference
handy) there was an article in the American Mathematical Monthly by a
guy who had collected license numbers from a dozen or so states and
figured out the algorithms for most of them.  The math monthly (which
is not a crypto or puzzle magazine) thought his methods and results
were interesting enough to print.  For sci.crypt the subject matter
seems even more appropriate.  It is an opportunity for people to
practice their codebreaking skills on an unknown code that actually
was designed for some practical requirements.  I've tried a few
of the obvious approaches and nothing has worked so far, but I plan
to stick at it at least a little while longer, time permitting.

I'm not sure what you're getting at.

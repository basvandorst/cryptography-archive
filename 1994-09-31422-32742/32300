Absolutely correct. This is just another european talking, so prepare
your flames if you like.

Actually, what the european law say is that you cam reverse engineer
some code to understand it *in order* to make things that will be
interacting or intefacing with it. But it explicitly forbides duplicating
other's code and using it for your own public purposes and distributing 
other's protected (in any legal sense) code by unlawful means. I.e. if these
guys did actually copy or steal the RSA code then its distribution is
unlawful. This is, you can deduce their secret, but you must still
protect it.

Moreover, even the above paragraph is not completely true. It is only
so *IFF* the producer DOES NOT provide any information about how you
can interface with their code. If they do procide you with the details
needed for you make programs correctly interacting with theirs then
you don't need to decompile and thus you have no right to break
their code.

Which is another interesting point here: if RSA provided the information
on how to interface with their algorithm then there was no reason for
them breaking it.

So, please, don't get the idea that european law is protecting
indiscriminated piracy. As you see, it still protects trade secrets or
goods. Only it tries to enforce cooperative work and give you the
mimnimum guarantee that you'll be able to develop *new* things and
applications.

BUT, the european law does not forbid you to make something that behaves
as another thing and distribute it if you do it by yourself, with your
own tools and not just copying the other's idea. So, if these guys, by
an independent approach arrived to a system that behaves like RSA's
code and thay can demonstrate it, it would be very difficult to indict
them on these premises (if I understood the law correctly). 
                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For, instance I can take a music CD, see how it works and make my own
reader and sell it. My reader would possibly behave like say one from
S**y or Ph***ps, and provide similar or the same functionality, but as
long as I developed it myself and didn't steal any protected idea of
them it would be legal.

This is reasonable. If someone devises a method and keeps it secret,
it's his/her choice. But if without any access to his secret method I
can devise a similar one, why shouldn't I be able to use my own 
productions?

OTH, I haven't the law at hand now, but you were able to study, use
or modify anything you bought (protected or not) in any way you wanted
to fit any purpose of you as long as it was for your *private* use
and needs (i.e. a company could buy 100 copies of a word processor,
reengineer them to suit their special needs and use *those 100
reengineered copies* for their private use, they couldn't use 101
nor sell the reengineered program nor distribute it nor lend it nor
anything like that). The idea is that if you have a tool that desn't
suit your needs you can modify it to suit your needs (like say
you make a new adaptor for your vacuum cleaner, but you can't begin
making copies of the vacuum cleaner with your adaptor and selling the
"adapted" or "enhanced" vacuum cleaner -you could sell the adaptor
though-).

Which doesn't address anyway the fact that it was a secret of RSA, an
influent agency from the US, a very influent country, so even if these
guys were european, they would still have a hard time. OTOH, it would
be an issue of international law, which makes it even more complicated.

Anyway, its a very difficult matter and IMHO it is better left to the
tribunals.

	Hope this clarifies a bit the things and enhances our mutual
understanding. Mainly the comprehension of some easy-readers europeans
on their own law!

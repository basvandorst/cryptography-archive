I have heard this claim a lot.  So I did some measurements.
There is no clear difference in speed--in fact if anything the
RSAREF lib might be a tad faster under some conditions, but it
is really all buried in other larger variances, really, so I
would not swear to that either.  I don't believe there is any
*practical* difference at all.  (BTW, I don't know what
"efficient" might mean if not speed.  Memory usage?  Didn't
measure that, but neither gave me any trouble.)

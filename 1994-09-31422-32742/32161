Hello,
I'm not an expert of cryptography but a journalist. So forgive me...

1. Where do I find any information about braking the RSA 129 code?

2. Is PGP much safer than RSA 129?

3. Does anyone heard about prof. Topolewski's ZT Ultra-Perfect algorithm?
He says it unbreakable because it uses "dynamic encoding without user's
will". The same message each time it is enciphered it has another
ciphertext. (BTW: How about synchronization)
Algorithm uses NO KEY (a.k.a. INFINITE KEY). (What is that?!)
The longer ciphertext is the more difficult to break.

According to company that sells ZT Ultra-Perfect, algorithm is now patented.
NATO is interested in using it.

Please help
Regards,

Andrzej

Uhhh, Eric -- I might suggest you actually read the law in California.
*If* (a big if admittedly) the trade secret were improperly acquired
and published then RSA could enjoin anybody else -- including innocent
third parties -- from using the secret that was improperly revealed.

But I'm sure RSA would have to show that it was, in fact, *improperly*
published (and other requirements such as showing they took secrecy
seriously, etc.) before these other statutory remedies would take force.

It *looks* as if someone simply reverse engineered the code from assembler
into C. If that were the case and if that person had no other contractual
or other obligation to keep RSA's trade secret, then ...

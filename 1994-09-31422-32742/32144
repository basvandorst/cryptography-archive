Its too late to patent it.  That's the tradeoff with trade-secrets vs.
patents: with the former, you get exclusive control, as long as no one
figures it out; with patents, you get to license it for 17 years,
but others can see how it works and improve it.

PS: This reeks of thhe sword-rattling of last year when someone anonymously
posted an encryption-breaking script for some ECAD tool... and the
toolbuilder's rabid lawyers threatened everyone withh a newsfeed...

I beg your pardon!  I was merely trying to complement you on your wit and
verve in pretending to be obtuse and ignorant in matters legal, when it
has been my personal experience that you are intelligent, incisive, and
quite bright.  I know that you wouldn't actually say things like "I have a
problem with words like is" in one post and "this is *definately*
misappropriation" in another unless you were merely showing off your
highly developed sense of humor.

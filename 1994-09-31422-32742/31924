Subject: Space Signals? Random?

Can you use the signals from space as random data? You know, like radio
waves/UV/microwaves, etc.? Like, you could get as much as you wanted, their
is a huge amount of it, always new signals, it it would take a buncha
supercomputers to model just a small amount of the signals from one area, so
it would be impossible to duplicate...(right?)

Would this help at all?

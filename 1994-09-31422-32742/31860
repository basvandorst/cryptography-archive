The one time pad is the most powerfull encryption method.  It is
unbreakable, unlike you are foolish, like re-using keys.

All other ciphers have weaknesses.  Unfortunately, the better block
ciphers (like DES or IDEA) are so complex, that nobody can tell, how
easy they are to break.  Of course, you can say: today's state of the
art is, that choosen-plaintext needs 2^47 cycles to break DES.

But then, this number may be plain rubbish by tomorrow.

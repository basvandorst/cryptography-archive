Keep Out magazine is dedicated to promoting ideas and technologies that make
it harder to monitor and control people.  To celebrate our first issue, (which
hit newsstands August 1) we are offering a *FREE* sample issue to anyone who
requests one.  Just send your name and mailing address to us, and you'll soon
receive an issue, with no strings attached.  Keep Out's mailing list is
strictly confidential.  We will never give, sell or lease our mailing list to
anyone, for any reason.

You will not be billed.  You will be under no obligation.  If you decide Keep
Out is not for you, just do nothing.

If you do like Keep Out, send a check to the address below, and you will
receive six issues a year of timely information on electronic privacy,
anonymity, digital cash, steganography, and everything else that can keep Big
Brother's eyes off you.

This is a new aspect of an old idea.  Rather than simply accepting privacy
handed down by others (which can easily be taken away), Keep Out teaches you
how to TAKE privacy for yourself.  That way, nobody can take it away from you.

Some of this information is available on-line, in Internet newsgroups and
Fidonet echos--but it needs to be available to EVERYONE.  To people without
net access.  And to people who don't have the time to wade through thousands
of messages a month.

The first issue of Keep Out focused on encryption, with a lengthy interview
with Philip Zimmermann, a beginner's introduction to PGP, and a review of PGP
to off-line mail-reader shells.

The second issue, which will hit newsstands October 1, will focus on
anonymity--featuring interviews with remailer operators, how-to articles on
using remailers, and of course, a continuation of our PGP for beginners
series.

A one-year (six issue) subscription to Keep Out costs $15.  We can not accept
credit cards, but checks and money orders payable to "Keep Out" are more than
welcome.

Call (818) 345-8640 (voice) for more information, or write us at:

           Keep Out
           P.O. Box 571312
           Tarzana, CA 91357-1312
           USA

You can also reach us through the Internet at ac086@lafn.org, or
Keep.Out@Sprawl.Expressnet.Org, or through Fidonet at "Keep Out" at
1:102/903.0.

We also operate a dial-up BBS, called the Sprawl, available 24 hours a day at
(818) 342-5127.  The Sprawl has a huge collection of encryption, electronic
privacy and civil liberties files, available free to first-time callers, as
well as most Internet newsgroups and Fidonet echos related to electronic
privacy.

Thanks very much for your time.


Sincerely,


John Schofield

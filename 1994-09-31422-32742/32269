As Grady Ward and I predicted, the serious danger in publishing or
republishing RC4 to Internet Newsgroups and mailing lists which go overseas
automatically from the U.S. is that so to do is a violation of the ITAR, a
Federal felony carrying big jail time. EACH export of RC4 requires an export
license from the State Department.

Today, on page B7 of the Wall Street Journal (maybe B10 in other than the
Western Edition) it is reported that both the FBI and the U.S. Customs
Service are now investigating this matter.

Stay tuned.

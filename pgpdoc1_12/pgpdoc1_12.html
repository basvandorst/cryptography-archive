<H2>Decrypting and checking signatures</H2>
<P>To decrypt an encrypted file, or to check the signature integrity of a
signed file:
<PRE>
    pgp ciphertextfile [-o plaintextfile]
</PRE>
Note that [brackets] denote an optional field, so don't actually type
real brackets.  
<P>The ciphertext file name is assumed to have a default extension of
<VAR>.pgp</VAR>.  The optional plaintext output file name specifies where to
put processed plaintext output.  If no name is specified, the
ciphertext filename is used, with no extension.  If a signature is
nested inside of an encrypted file, it is automatically decrypted and
the signature integrity is checked.  The full user ID of the signer
is displayed.
<P>Note that the <I>unwrapping</I> of the ciphertext file is completely 
automatic, regardless of whether the ciphertext file is just signed,
just encrypted, or both.  PGP uses the key ID prefix in the
ciphertext file to automatically find the appropriate secret
decryption key on your secret key ring.  If there is a nested
signature, PGP then uses the key ID prefix in the nested signature to
automatically find the appropriate public key on your public key ring
to check the signature.  If all the right keys are already present on
your key rings, no user intervention is required, except that you
will be prompted for your password for your secret key if necessary. 
If the ciphertext file was conventionally encrypted without public
key cryptography, PGP recognizes this and prompts you for the pass
phrase to conventionally decrypt it.

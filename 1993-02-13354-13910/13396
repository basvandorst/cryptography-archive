Smooth move. In aid of catching a few tactical-level drug peddlers too
stupid to use their phones carefully, they are permitting rich industrial
competitors (including not only the Japanese but also each other--the French
are well known for industrial espionage against non-French) with computer
power to read their commercial cell phone traffic.

If one attributes intelligence, rather than bureaucratic stupidity, to this
action, then law enforcement must assume few criminals will be so stupid as
to use their phones "openly" for illegal acts. Thus it becomes an attempt to
deny them the use of secure phones rather than an attempt to listen in on
conversations which would (except for some stupid criminals) be valueless.

If so it means enforcement bureaucracy thinks denying criminals the use of
secure phones is worth the risk of denying legitimate business the use of
secure phones in an environment where rich competitors can tap the "less
secure" phones.

If not, it's just plain stupidity since they are exposing major business to
foreign competitive espionage which can cost their country hundreds of
millions in a world of economic warfare, for a trivial gain in being able to
hear the conversations of those few druggies stupid enough to talk openly,
knowing they can be overheard.

In either case, I despair for the sanity of governments.

Knowing how the bureaucratic mind works, this will also be used as an
argument for keeping something similar in the U.S., if and when the Clinton
administration revisits this subject.

Actually, I (the original poster) wasn't all that concerned about getting an amazingly accurate square root of the number n.  What I really wanted was a way to get several THOUSAND digits from a seed, that were unique to that seed and followed no discernable pattern.  That is why I picked irrational square roots.  The numbers after the decimal just keep going and going and ....
	But how to get that many figures?  That was my problem and it is still essentially unanswered.  I am programming in C and I assume that eve with double precision floating point numbers, I can only get 64 digits or so.  So how do I get a few thousand?

Subject: steganography & error-correction
Lines: 26

Hello.

I've put some thought into a general-purpose steganographic system based
on expanding chunks -- for example, bytes -- of cyphertext into words in
randomly generated sentences.  While this would stand no chance against
a "real human" search for encrypted messages, it could be made to evade
such attacks as analysis of word frequency, character frequency, and
word length distribution.  As an added benefit (actually, the major
motivator for the scheme), the (steganographized? how would you say that
:) text could be transmitted over noisy channels and reconstructed with
the aid of a simple spell-checker and a human's pattern-recognition
facilities.  And since the cyphertext is contained solely in the words,
whitespace-munging associated with gateways and cross-system
distribution could be ignored.

I have a trial system of which I'm ready to start an implementation, but
I'd suspect work has already been done in this area.  Could anyone point
me to relevant material on the subject?  Any additional comments would
be appreciated, of course.

Thank you.
Liam Gray

	An amateur cryptologist sticks his neck out and observes the
	following and hopes he isn't reinventing the wheel...

	I did a (manual) frequency analysis of the digits in the whole
	sequence and found

Digit   1       2       3       4       5

Freq.   0.103   0.099   0.105   0.09    0.096

Digit   6       7       8       9       0

Freq.   0.105   0.113   0.103   0.098   0.088

	Which doesn't look excessively random to me, but being a rotten
	statistician, I couldn't decide which test to use for significance.

	If you look at the first digit of each group, the distribution is
	rather different:

Digit   1       2       3       4       5

Freq.   0.122   0.091   0.091   0.117   0.086

Digit   6       7       8       9       0

Freq.   0.071   0.127   0.152   0.081   0.066

	This suggests to me that this is supposed to be random number
	string created by someone banging away at a typewriter.  The
	indication being that the distribution is very different for the
	first letter of each group: after hitting the space bar, it seems
	that the strongest typing fingers are most likely to hit their
	number than the others.  The difference in the frequencies of 4
	is particularly striking.  As a control, I generated 1000 numbers
	using the top row of my keyboard and then split them into 5-figure
	groups by inserting spaces.  Although the number distribution was
	strongly biased because of my idiosyncratic typing style, there
	was no longer a difference in frequency distributions between the
	first number of each group and the list as a whole.

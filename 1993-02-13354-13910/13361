       How would you guys rate PGP, in terms of security, vs. other encryption
   systems? Also, what does PGP stand for?

PGP, which stands for Phil Zimmermann's Pretty Good Privacy, is not an
encryption system.  It is a program that utilizes the RSA and IDEA
crypto systems.

PGP is only as secure as its parts.  If someone breaks IDEA, RSA, or
MD5, the PGP has been broken.  Then again, if someone breaks RSA or
MD5, PEM would have been broken, too!  :-)

I hope this answers your question....

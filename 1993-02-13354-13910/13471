How about uuencode or xxencode, or any crypt system followed by uuencode
or xxencode. Is that what you mean since that's essentially what the
unix password crypt does. ( Actually, the password unix crypt is weaker than that
since (in practice) it takes as input an ascii string, or essentially ascii and gives
12 ascii bytes back. ie, 12 byte ascii password|uudecode|crypt might
make a better password routine tha the present where almost noone uses
the non-printing characters in their passwords anyway. (Do you knoow
anyone who has ctrl-g say in their password, never mind ctrl-c, ctrl-m,
ctrl-h etc)

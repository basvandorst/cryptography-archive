   Many thanks for all the Mail and News aritcles on this
    subject.  Basically, a summary would read,  "Have two methods
    for sending the Public Key, one of which the Evil Empire cannot
    control." 

   The reason that I started this article, is that I am considering
    adding PGP to an InterNet Mail/News package we turn out for
    MS-Windows users.  All of the traffic goes through our San
    Francisco node (toll free lines on the way), and *we* could be
    the evil empire.  We are not, and have no intention of doing
    anything of the sort, but I wanted to know if there was a way
    that our users could be *sure* that we are not.  See summary
    above.  This can be a problem, as we are not going to control
    the keys, the users will, and they are going to have call one
    another to be sure.  Oh well, another note for the IMPORTANT,
    PLEASE READ section of the docs...  :-)

   Thanks again and best regards (gone for 4 weeks.. 
    help@win.net for more info),

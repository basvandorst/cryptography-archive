This really belongs in sci.crypt, to which I've cross-posted my answer.
There had been some fear that multiple encryption with DES was useless
because DES might be a group,  In that case, there would be some third
key that would have the same effect as your two input keys -- and NSA,
or GCHQ, or whomever your favorite cryptanalytic agency is wouldn't
care that they didn't decrypt it your way...

Anyway, it's now been proven that DES is not a group.  There is still
a variant on exhaustive search that works on double encryption, but it
takes a lot of memory.  Most folks recommend triple encryption, with
two keys, and the second step a decryption using the second key.  The
first and third steps use the first key.

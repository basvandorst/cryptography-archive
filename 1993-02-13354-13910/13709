Hi everybody,

I'm looking for some test-vectors for the DES algorithm. What I would like
most is an electronic version of the patterns described in "Validating the
correctness of hardware implementations of the DES" by Jason Gait. However,
all other documents are welcome.

Maybe someone knows the address of some ftp-server from which i can get 
those patterns.

Regards,

Acording to the Sunday Times (31 Jan) the whole GSM standard has
been changed to specify A5X encryption, which is less difficult
to crack.  This is in response to GCHQ etc not being able to snoop.
The GSM manufacturers must be really pleased !  All those chips to
throw away and re-design.

Anyone know anything about A5 or A5X ?

 (Christopher Browne) responds to the idea of XORing two RNG's to
 gain a longer sequence:

 I see no reason to believe this is true, and in fact, believe it
 to be false.  However, the proposition would seem to require a
 definition of "strength," and a way to unambiguously compute the
 strength of a combined mechanism.  This is one of the fundamental
 problems in cryptography.

 With respect to the resulting period, if both RNG's have the same
 period, than there will be no improvement.  If, however, their
 periods are relatively prime, then the resulting period will be
 the product of the constituent periods.  One would assume that any
 designer doing this would make sure to do it right.

 Combining RNG's with XOR is an accepted technique (although now
 perhaps somewhat dated), and is even used in modern statistical
 RNG's.

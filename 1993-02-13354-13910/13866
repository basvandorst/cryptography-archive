     Just a small nitpick:  This is true IF the key is truly random.  By 'truly
random', I mean that no amount of information about the key, including every
bit of the key except bit i gives you any help at all in predicting bit i.
Bit i has probability of 0.5 of being a 0, and 0.5 of being a 1.
 
     If knowing other bits in the pad X (say, X(i-1)) gives you some hints
about X(i), then someone who knows something about the plaintext being
encrypted may be able to figure out enough of your pad to read your message.
This is why simply XORing the output from a simple pseudorandom number
generator isn't a good encryption scheme.

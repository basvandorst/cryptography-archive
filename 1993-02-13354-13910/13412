        Unfortunately easier than one would think. "Magnetic polymer"
        is a precise description of the widely available toner that's
        used in xerographic laser printers to print micr on demand.
        Also, the Delphax ionographic printers use a toner that's
        magnetite particles wrapped in polymer. Either one is
        relatively cheap to buy and can lay down an image with 300 dpi
        precision.

        An interesting approach to secret writing would involve
        printing a page in two passes; once with magnetic toner and
        once with ordinary toner. The relationship between the two
        could hide a message (readable with a dissassembled cassette
        player).

        Cheers,
               Marc

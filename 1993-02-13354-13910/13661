I wrote a MS-Windows interface that used those programs (encode.c
and decode.c) but my C compiler uses 16-bit ints.  I started to
go through and change the variables that need to be 32-bitters,
but never finished.  But if anyone would like to try out and
critique my interface in the meantime, I could send a uuencoded
file.

Anybody have a version of those two routines that I could drop in?
I came to the realization that it might be kind of hard to test
my modified version once I've finished it.

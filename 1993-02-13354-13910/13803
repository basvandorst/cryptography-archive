Now I'm drifting a bit but... Pete Shelley had code for the ZX Spectrum
microcomputer as one of the tracks on his XL II album. It wasn't a novel
musical approach though; the code was lyrics to the songs, with some 
interesting colour line displays in the background. You loaded the code into
your Spectrum, started the program at the same time as the lp, and you had
real-time lyrics to all the songs!

The SecureNet Key or SNK is manufactured by Digital Pathways Inc and is
a small calculator, about half the size of a credit card.

It stores a 16 digit DES key, assigned by the system administrator when
the users account is first created.
It is generally used for dial-in modem access, users are given an 8-digit
random hex challenge by the system when they dial-in.

The user has one minute to key this in to the SNK which is algorithmically
combined with the programmed key to obtain a response number.

This is keyed back to the system, if the two match, the user is connected
to the service, vax etc.

The key itself has a programmable PIN of up to 16 Hex digits and can be set
to erase all memory should the PIN be entered wrong five consecutive times.

It also has two battery compartments so that the battery can be changed
without losing any stored values.

Hope this helps.


Dave.

Oh, for god's sake lighten up. There's so much bloody wasted bandwidth on
the Internet that a challenge like this is hardly inappropriate. If you'd
ever tried to bootstrap a small software company, you'd certainly
appreciate the opportunity to use external resources quite cheaply. All
the "participants" are (likely) adults, with the legal right to swear,
smoke, boink, and attempt plaintext attacks on ciphers. It's not an
advertisement, and actually seems like it would quite interest a number of
aficionados of this group.
 
Your cynicism is NOT pardoned, at least by yours truly. I can't think of a
BETTER way to do their testing, regardless of cost, without involving the
CIA, NSA, or MI's 5 through 6.  You owe the Obstacle a ciphertext of the
Tatler ;-)

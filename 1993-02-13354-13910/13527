You want algorithms, we got algorithms!  Let me point you to two places -
- Knuth's books, of course, will have material on how to do arithmetic,
	which will get you multiprecision stuff, and how to do
	function evaluations with techniques like Newton's method.
- Numerical Recipes in C probably has something like that - it's a cookbook.
	Any good book on numerical analysis will have this stuff,
	and will tell you the fun parts about how accurate you can get
	given what kinds of calculations you're doing; in college I
	used Dahlquist & Bjork, but there's probably something 10
	years newer with examples for PCs.
	

As far as details, Newton-Raphson for square roots gives you
	
	x    =  ( x  + a/x  ) /2
	 n+1       n      n

where a is the number  whose square root you want.
Since you know how to do long division, you can figure out how to
do the equivalent on a computer, or get the GNU multi-precision
numeric package from somewhere.  Division is annoying, but the
convergence rate is quadratic once you start with a decent approximation.

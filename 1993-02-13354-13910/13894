True, but I would hope that

  1) They still have to show a warrant to request the tap.
  2) There is a log of such activities.

You missed out climbing up a telephone pole to attach a tap.  It was
easy in the old days when there was a single wire (the return path being
via earth).  Now you either have to remove the outer from a 6-core cable
and then strip insulation from the relevant cores, or build yourself an
induction detector capable of picking up the stray fields from what is
effectively twisted pair.  I suppose you could also go down a manhole/open
up one of the green cabinets and search for the right connection.

But all these activities leave them open to being seen.  And the more they
do it, the more likely it is they get caught out.  The penalties of which
are not only a severe bollocking, but the thing every civil servant dreads -
loss of index-linked pension.  So they have to balance the risks against the
payoff, which means that (on average), I would expect the number of illicit
taps to be proportional to the number of sanctioned taps - i.e., there is a
measure of indirect control (but nowhere near as much as I would like).

There is another method which ought to be obvious to you, since you work
in the shadow of Telecom Tower (or whatever they called it after it stopped
being the Post Office Tower) - listening in to the spillage from the
microwave links.  Dunno just how feasible that is, what with thousands of
calls being multiplexed over a single channel, together with packet-switching
(do BT know about that yet?), but every article you see about GCHQ credits
them with almost superhuman powers...

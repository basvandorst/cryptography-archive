What's wrong with the system is that there still is a cycle.  If one
RNG has a cycle of 10000 and the other has a cycle of 20000, then it's
POSSIBLE that the joint cycle is 10000x20000, or 20,000,000.  (On the
other hand, there may be some cancelling, so that the joint cycle
might be a lot less).

The point is that the combined RNG function can probably be
simplified, so that you essentially wind up with a "single" RNG.  

You haven't fundamentally gained anything, and if the combination
simplifies drastically enough, the combination may be even WEAKER than
either of the constituent RNGs.  It can't be STRONGER, at any rate.

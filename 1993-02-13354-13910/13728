Most of the discussion has been along the lines of
  "If the cops wanted to eavesdrop legally, all they need is a warrant
  and they can wiretap the Central Office, so banning encrypted cellular
  must obviously be to facilitate illegal wiretapping/eavesdropping."

While I'm sure this is their primary motivation, their are other
benefits to police from being able to wiretap cellular car-phones directly,
some of which are probably legal and others are at least interesting:

- An article in Wired referred to work done by cellular-phone hackers on
tracking the locations of cellular phones by listening to the paging
traffic used by the cellular system to locate subscribers, set up calls,
hand off between cells, etc., and commented that some of this can be
done even when the phone is NOT making a phone call.

If I remember correctly, while wiretapping phone conversations without
a warrant is illegal, using a "pen register" or equivalent modern technology
to record the phone numbers a suspect calls does *not* require a warrant.
Is the equivalent activity for cellular phones legal?
Has GSM or any of the other cellular standards addressed the problem?

- If you've got a warrant to wiretap some Real Criminal's phones, is it
reasonable to want a warrant that lets you tap ANY phone they use?
"Sarge, Carmen SanDiego just got into a red Porsche, license plate GETAWAY,
and she's making a phone call."
"Sorry, our database doesn't show a known car phone for that car -
you'll have to eavesdrop."

(The alternative approach isn't real pretty either - 
"ok, license plate GETAWAY is 908-949-0705, we'll set up a tap in 2 seconds")

==
Even if it *is* legal, I'm not very comfortable having Big Brother
able to find me by my car phone, or license plate, or eavesdrop a phone.
But if you're arguing the law enforcement side for the moment,
it *is* useful, and *can* help stop real criminals from doing real crimes,
or at least help catch them after they've done them.

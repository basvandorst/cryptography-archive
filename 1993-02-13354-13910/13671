I have talked to John on the phone about this, and have removed the key
from my master keyring on the keyserver.  Derek (warlord@mit.edu) has
removed the key as well I believe.

This is the GOOD key:

Type bits/keyID   Date       User ID
pub  1024/FFB199 1992/12/20  John A. Perry <home - perry@jpunix.com>

As for Vesselin's virus analogy, he's right.  All it would take is one
person to refuse to remove a key, and it's here forever.

I'll look into something which can be put into the key server software
I've written to possibly handle this sort of problem.

FYI:  there are at least TWO incidents of this occuring so far.  I'm
      sure it won't end there.

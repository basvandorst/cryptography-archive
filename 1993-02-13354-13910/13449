Isn't this "international law"?  I thought there were a number of treaties
severely restricting the encryption of radio traffic, so countries could
verify their neighbors weren't planning on invading them...

(Obviously a large number of users _are_ authorized to encrypt their
radio traffic.  However, there is a big difference between encrypted traffic
coming from embassies (technically part of the respective nations) and
military bases and encrypted traffic coming from _everywhere_).

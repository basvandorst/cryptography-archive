   But not a randomly shuffled deck of cards. Some arrangements will
   be much more likely than others.  Try it with a deck of 3 cards
   instead of 52, and you will see that the algorithm generates 3
   random numbers in the range 1..3, for a total of 3^3 = 27 different
   possible sequences of random numbers.  The number of permutations
   is 3! = 6. Since 6 does not divide 27, it follows that the 6 possible
   permutations are not generated with equal probability.

   [... correct algorithm deleted ...]

Indeed. 3 of the permutations (acb, bac, bca) are generated with a
probability of 5/27, the other 3 with 4/27. A more interesting
question is how to describe the probability distribution over the
permutations. There's no really obvious system here.

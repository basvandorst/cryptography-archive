Yeah, but that's the point:  For the purpose of signing or authenticating
a public key, there has to be some specific meaning attached to the act that
we all agree on.  You are right, people's definitions of what authenicating
means vary widely.  If I demand to meet you in person before I "authenicate"
your key, while you consider it OK to authenticate if you have conversed
with me via email extensively prior to the request, and someone else thinks
authenticating means fingering an account to make sure it exists, the
"authenticated" key doesn't really mean anything.  Imagine the chaos that
would result if everyone were allowed to choose for themselves what
significance the signing of the bottom of their check held.  

I agree, authenticating means different things to different people, but,
say, signing a PGP key should signify a specific level of authentication
that everyone understands.

For those of you with reach of London, England. An extract from IEE
News 4/2/93:

"Enigma was probably the best known of all the wartime cipher
machines, and more than 30 000 Engima machines were in use by German
and other armed forces by 1945. The original version was solved in
1932 by the Poles, who passed on their analytical methods to the
British and French in 1939. Despite a number of improvements to its
security, the cryptoanalysts at Bletchley led by Turing and other
mathematicians were able to decipher millions of messages,
significantly affecting the outcome of, *inter alia*, the Battle of
Britain, the naval battle of Matapan, El Alamein, the war against the
U-boats and the battles in France in 1944-45.

An Electronics Divisional Lecture to be delivered by Prof. Churchhouse
at Savoy Place on Wednesday, 3 March 1993 will provide an account of
the history and exploitation of the machine and of the fundamental
weaknesses that led to its solution. An Enigma machine will be on
display and available for examination."

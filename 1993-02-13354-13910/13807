Well, from a non-mathematician, here is a simple way for which comment
on how well it works is invited.

(actual card deck described to aid simplification)

1. create an array[52] of int
2. initialize the array, array[n] = n.
3. for n = 1 to 52 
     generate a random integer 'r', 1..52
     temp = array[r]
     array[r] = array[n]
     array[n] = temp
4. you now have a shuffled deck of cards

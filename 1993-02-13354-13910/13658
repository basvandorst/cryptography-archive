[some very well written prose extoling the virtues of anon postings deleted]

My view is that anonymous postings will allow for an excess of 
name-calling and other non-civil behaviour.  Call me a pesemist.

I really don't see how you can "promote" them as a "positive good".
There is no reward.  There is no punishment.  Both the carrot and
stick are gone.

As for the fears of persecution and cowing of the masses by status.  
I really haven't seen much of that.  This media already encourages
frankness and forthrightness.  It already lessens the perceived 
authority of status.  Forums such as USENET, by providing a means for 
anyone to share their thoughts with millions, already provides a means 
for countering the very threats that are imagined.

If you are ashamed of your thoughts, then maybe you shouldn't broadcast 
them to millions.  If you just think that it won't be well received, 
then be emboldened by the thousands that have fought and died to make 
sure you can at least speak your mind.  By doing so publicly, and not
hiding behind the mask of anonymity, you also help to further streach
the bounds of acceptable discourse.

Revolutions are not won by people sitting in a back room plotting and
scheming.  They are won by those that are willing to take personal
risk and publicly speak out against what they deem unjust.

Cheers,
Rob

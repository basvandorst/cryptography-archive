	The extreme case of eavesdropping reportedly happened in the UK, in
	which when a 150 khz tone was applied to the phone line's wires from
	the central office, conversations in the house could be heard, even
	though the phone was hung up. Nasty indeed!

All efforts to date have shown the infamous 'infinity transmitter' to be
urban/spy folklore.  Could you cite your source for this please?

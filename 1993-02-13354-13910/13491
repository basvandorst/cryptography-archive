     IDEA uses a 128-bit key to generate 52 16-bit subkey blocks.  I asked
a while back why it wouldn't make sense for PGP to simply generate the 52
subkey blocks, instead of the single 128-bit key.  Can anyone explain it to
me?  Is the IDEA key scheduling algorithm (Rotating 25 bits) somehow important
in defeating some specific attack?  It's not immediately clear to my why this
would be so, but I'd find it interesting to find out if it is the case.
 
     Has anyone discussed using both DES and IDEA on a message to be encrypted?
It strikes me that this might be a good bit of insurance, since if one was
broken, your messages might still be fairly strong.  (Ideally, you could offset
the output blocks of the first cipher 32 bits, so that the second cipher acted
on the last half of the previous output block of the first cipher, and on the
first half of the current block.)
 
     Are there ftp-able documents on other presumed-strong block ciphers?

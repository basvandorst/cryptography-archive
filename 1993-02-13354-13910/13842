But there IS a simple way to cipher the IMSI (or anything else), using
public key cryptography.  Have the receiver (the MSC?) send an encrypting
key (for which of course only it knows the decrypting key), as well as
a random number as large as the IMSI.  Then the subscriber simply xor's the
IMSI with this random number, and encrypts it with the encrypting key.
The receiver just does the opposite to recover the IMSI.  The random
number is to insure the subscriber's encrypted IMSI won't look the same
everytime he uses the same encryption key (presumably an MSC does not
normally need to change its encryption/decryption key pair).  Of course
the TMSI/LAI could still be useful for efficiency, since public key
cryption can be relatively expensive.
Public key can also be used to authenticate the subscriber (give a decrypting
key to the network when you join, keep the encrypting key).

Sorry I don't know anything about the GSM network or related details, 
just that lots more is possible using public key cryptography than
what you mentioned.  Or am I missing something, like GSM can't do
public key cryptography for some reason?

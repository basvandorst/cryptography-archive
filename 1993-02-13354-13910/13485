I just upgraded to os/2 2.x and wanted to compile pgp 2.1.  I thought this
would be trivial since I access to both emx 0.8f and watcom c 9.0 for os/2.

Unfortunately, things are not as they seem!  I have tried to use gnu make 3.62,
nmake 2, dmake 3.8, and watcom make without any success!  I am not totally
familiar with makefiles, so I am not confident to write my own.

Has anybody else managed to compile pgp 2.1 to os/2?  I would like to ask
how you managed to do so, as I think it would teach me a great deal about
how to get future programs to compile.

Email or posts would be appreciated.

Would be better if PGP could handle it somehow... The key server
software is fine, but we should think that there are also people who
are using PGP on PCs and who do not have easy access to the net... I
think the best solution is to implement something like a kill file for
PGP - file that lists keys you don't want to be added to your public
keyring.

There's a third one since yesterday. If you see a 384-bit key that
belongs to Ross Greenberg (the author of FluShot+) and is signed by
me, don't put it in your keyring. The good (new) key for Ross is
1024-bit (he -did- back up this one <grin>) and can be found in the
public key collection at our ftp site.

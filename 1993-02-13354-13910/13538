Cypher Devours wrote a book with a similar (the same?) title, but I thought
it was published a little more recently.  Aegean Park Press might have it.
(They also published in 1981 "Computer Simulation of Classical Substitution
Cryptographic Systems" by Lauer.  It includes some notes on cryptanalysis.
The copy I found has a picture of the Commodore Pet on the cover; you can
guess the language used in the included programs. :-)  )


I'm sure people out there have workbenches where the Crypt Breaker's Workbench
would be a small subset.  I wonder if any of those are generally available, or
if it is an apprenticeship project -- if we were *serious* about crypto, we
would write our own....

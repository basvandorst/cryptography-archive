Post questions to the gropu.  SOme people may not be interested in answering
basic questions, but I think they're more interesting than political
discussions.

My suggestion is that you get better book.  I was never ver impressed with
Welsh.  Dorothy Denning's Cryptography_and_Data_Security (Addison Wesley, 1982)
is good.  Also good, but more mathematical, is Arto Salomaa's Public_Key_
_Cryptography (Springer-Verlag, 1990).

Goodluck,
Bruce

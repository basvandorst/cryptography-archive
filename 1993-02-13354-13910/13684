In article <2176@vrta.win.net> danwise@vrta.win.net (Dan Wisehart)
asks how you can set up a secure conversation using public keys
when the Evil Empire may be doing active wiretapping.
Carl Ellisun (cme@sw.stratus.com) replies:

   It is impossible to authenticate the person on the other end of the
   connection unless the two of you share a secret.  This has nothing to do
   with Public Key crypto.

But it's not (well, not quite.) - the nice thing about Public Key Crypto
is that you can share a secret while everybody's watching.
As long as you have a sufficiently trustable way of transmitting
information in *public*, you can broadcast your public key, and your
friend can broadcast hers, so you can send mail that only the owner of
the corresponding private key can read.  If both of you have kept your
private keys from being stolen, and read the newspapers to watch for
the classified ad you posted with your keys, and you can publicly or
privately get a message to each other in case the Empire also posted
a key claiming to be yours, then you're ok.  And if there are people
you mutually trust, you can get the to certify your keys.

Can you verify that the Empire hasn't stolen Alice's private key,
whether by electromagnetic eavesdropping on her PC or by
replacing her PC (or her) with a Replicant, or holding a gun to her head?  No.
For that you need a previously shared secret, maybe only usable once.
But what if she's really a narc?  Even secrets won't help that case.

But for the normal case, you can create a safe connection, and there
are protocols in the usual crypto books about how to make the process
a little more reliable, more convenient, or both.  As long as you've
got enough physical security t keep your private keys private, you win.

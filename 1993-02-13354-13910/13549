I agree with you about amateur radio and, yes the rules always seemed 
anachronistic even when I was a lad (no discussion of politics either, as I 
remember). But ham radio is a relatively insignificant use of the spectrum. 

We also seem agreed that no restriction on the encryption of governmental 
traffic (I include military et al) would seem to exist as the norm. 
Governmental use is, in one way or another, the largest spectum user, 
check the published allocation of bandwidth to various user groupings. That, 
for mutual safety, certain communications may be left unencrypted at certain 
times is, again, a minor caveat.

This leaves the question of the use of encrypted signals by commercial 
organisations, the other big user of bandwidth. Ciphers have always
been associated the broadcast of commercially sensitive information, be it 
where the fish shoals are today, or where oil tankers are on the high seas. 
The Vernam cipher was in commercial use from the 1920's and may even still see
some service today. Other systems may do so too. 

With the increasing move of international radio traffic to satellite links, 
there seem to be fewer 'squeaks and farts' in the HF band than there used to 
be, but they're still there. In the VHF/UHF/SHF bands the number of 'complex' 
signals increases, particularly in metropolitan areas. Were some encrypted, 
it would not suprise me at all.

No doubt, encrypted transmission of non-governmental communications is 
forbidden in some countries (with greater or lesser effect) and subject to 
rigourous licencing controls in some others. Nevertheless, I can't see that a 
claim that all encrypted transmission is severely restricted by international 
consent and in the cause of world peace holds up......but there's always more 
to learn.  

BTW a EC company does do a very effective line in UHF bugs with true digital 
encryption on the signal.

I am not saying that PGP should only create PEM messaegs, but the simple
fact is that PEM _is_ an established standard and no amount of whining
after the fact is going to change that.  If PGP does not support PEM then
it will have limited application to a wide range of users because of it's
limitations in this area.  I know that I will be unable to recommend this
product to users because of this lack of functionality.  I am not saying
that PGP should lobotomize itself for the sake of PEM, but failure to
support a standard is just plain stupid.  There is no reason not to support
the ability to create messages that adhere to a finalized RFC, if only as a
user-specified option.

Why bother to have PGP add MIME compliance?  The MIME stuff is a MUA
problem, not something that PGP should try to deal with.  Yes, MIME is not
PEM, but there is already work being done on creating a standard for
encapsulating PEM messages in MIME.  Trying to reinvent the wheel is
stupid.  All that is needed is for PGP to have a mode that will output a
PEM message.  The mail agent can take care of things from that point (or
should).

While it may be easy for you to sit in your ivory tower and pass judgement
on what is good and what is bad, please remember that for many people (like
_all_ of them outside the US) PGP is the only package available to them
(legitimately) that they have a hope of using for PEM.  You cannot change
the fact that the PEM standard is just that, a _standard_.  As its usage
spreads you will find that PGP will get second-class status because of it's
failure to support the RFC.

You still have not given a valid reason _why PGP should not support this as
an option to the user_.  Please do not suppose that your view of where a
signature should be put or the necessity for anonymity regarding certain
items in a mail message are shared by the rest of the world.  Just give
people the option of choosing.  Burying your head in the sand and chanting
"PEM is bad, PEM is bad" will not change the fact that it is an RFC or
promote the use of PGP beyond the technically literate or fanatically
paranoid.

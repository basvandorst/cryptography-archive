Hello!

I just posted the Rcrypt Challenge, and would like to take this opportunity
to welcome any comments.  Hopefully, I didn't burn too much bandwidth with
the rules.  To this end, I'll refrain from posting the 77kbytes of cipher
text and 7kbytes of plain text :)  Please e-mail any comments (and flames)
to butzerd@ee.eng.ohio-state.edu.

Sincerely,
Dane C. Butzer

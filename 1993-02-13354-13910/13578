Sorry for adding noise to a group that seems to be recovering, but I'd
like to quote a post from a thread on anonymous postings currently running
in the `news.admin.policy' group.

I really hope that this isn't the start of a new dark period in the life
of `sci.crypt'.  Note that it's possible to reply to the anonymous poster
(the identity `an8785' being a pseudonym for a mail address stored at the
`anon.penet.fi' server). Also, note that by replying you'll be allocated
a pseudonym by the `anon.penet.fi' server.

Really?  Contact the people at Risks Digest and tell them the *EXACT* launch
date, *EXACT* flight name, or exact ANYTHING.  So far, they have been unable
to correlate any specific use of this FORTRAN error.  The only error they

in assembler, not FORTRAN.  But who knows, you might have found what they
have been looking for.

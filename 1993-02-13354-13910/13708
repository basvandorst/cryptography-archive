Hi,

I was wondering if anyone out there knew of any encryption algorithms that can
implement digital signatures relatively simply? I need source code for the
above for a project I'm working on at the moment, it involves encryption within
the framework of the ISODE using the Remote Operations Service ELement (ROSE).
I have everything necessary to implement the RSA encryption sheme, but will be
unable to do so for various reasons, mainly time constraints. 

So if someone out there knew of some public domain source code to implement a 
relatively simple digital signature sheme could they mail me at the adddress 
below to let me know about it?
  

Thanking you in advance,

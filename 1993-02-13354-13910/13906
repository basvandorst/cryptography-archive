True, but you also know how much I drink - perhaps that would explain it. :-)

Well, you know, if I were running BT and the spooks asked for remote tapping
facilities, then I'd make *damned* sure that the software at my end kept
a log so I knew what was going on and to protect my own backside.  OTOH,
given my views that managerial incompetence accounts for most of the
otherwise inexplicable happenings in the world today, maybe you're right.

If you're right that remote observation taps and indeed not logged then I'm
forced to agree with you.  If OTOH, such taps are recorded, then there is a
chance that such behaviour (or other, more tangible, illegal tapping methods)
may come to light, with consequent penalties on those involved - under such
conditions I would expect illegal taps to be roughly proportional to legal
taps (though the constant of proportionality could well be *very* large).

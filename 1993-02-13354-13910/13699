Actually, I can think of a legitimate purpose..."blind" referreeing.  I
admit there are very few people who will take an "expert"'s posting
uncritically, but suppose the expert wants it looked at critically.
"Temporary" pseudonyous posting seems appropriate for that.

Also, certain sites might not want to be associated with the content of an
article.  (The fact that almost all signatures have a disclaimer may
indicate the significance of that.)

I can't say I agree with the rest of anon's article, but, as with "Caller
ID", you have the right to ignore anon postings if you wish to.  If you are
a mail/news manager, you can even have your site block them, as with
call-block-blocking.

I have no idea what the UK situation is, but I doubt you owe any
royalties.  In the U.S., the DES patent expires in May of this year, so
I doubt that anyone would even try to collect.  Besides, IBM agreed to
grant royalty-free, non-exclusive licenses for manufacture or sale of
DES within the U.S..  This is recorded in the Patent Office Gazette for
May 13, 1975, and August 31, 1976.  (Source:  Davies and Price,
``Security for Computer Networks''.)

Now, I once heard a rumor that such licenses were valid if and only if
you used one of the four official modes of DES.  I have no idea whether
or not that's true.

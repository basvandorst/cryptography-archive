Not quite.  You have to change ``hopefully random digits'' to ``truly
random digits''.  If the keytext is generated by some non-random process,
then a cryptanalyst can attack that process.  Remember that DES in output
feedback mode still produces a long, random-looking stream of bits.
But it's not random, it's DES, and would be attacked as such by NSA, even
if you XOR it with your plaintext.

Btw -- there are some disadvantages to that sort of encryption scheme,
even if you really have a one-time pad.  Changes in the ciphertext stream
create predictable changes in the plaintext.  Let me give a somewhat-
contrived example.  Suppose you made a deposit at an ATM, and the machine
was going to send a message to your bank.  If you knew the exact contents
of the record, and hence the (non-cryptographic) checksum it would send,
you could flip bits in the ``deposit amount'' and ``checksum'' fields to
increase your deposit.  You can't create a message, nor can you decrypt
anyone else's -- but you can play games with the system nevertheless.

Maxim:  attackers don't go through security, they go around it.

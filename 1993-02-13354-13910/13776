Not quite so. 

	1. The opportunity to monitor between cellphone and base station
still exists as end-to-end encryption is not provided.

	2. No warrant is ever required, in any nation I know of, to monitor 
traffic extraterritorially. This was the circumstance discussed in the ST 
article.

It's a hard life, isn't it? But how are you proposing to control effectively
ether-monitoring with authorisation by warrant?

Face it. The ether is a dark room in which you know there are many other 
people, a few of whom you know and most of whom you don't. In such 
circumstances, if you choose to discuss who you are and your sensitive 
business in a loud voice, you really shouldn't feel hurt or suprised if 
several others listen to your conversation.

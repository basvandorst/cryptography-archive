  PGP 2.2 will allow the user to set a flag in his own public keyring
  for a particular key to deactivate that key.  When that flag is set,
  the following conditions hold--

  1)  Attempts to look up that key to use it for encryption will fail.

  2)  Attempts to extract it from the keyring will fail.  This will reduce
  the "viruslike" properties of dead keys.

  3)  Attempts to add the same key to the keyring again will do what it does
  now, that is, fail because it is already on the keyring.  This will also
  reduce the viruslike properties of dead keys.

  The "pgp -kd" command is used to revoke your own key.  But if you use the
  -kd command on someone else's public key, it will set this new deactivation
  flag for this key on your own public keyring.

  A more permanent solution will be implemented in a future version.
  This interim solution should help reduce the hassles in the meantime.
  Hopefully, most keys that must be revoked now will have the secret
  key available so that a revocation certificate may be properly issued
  by the key's owner with the current -kd command.

  Of course, I'm not the one implementing this new feature.  I'm just telling
  you folks about it.  :-)

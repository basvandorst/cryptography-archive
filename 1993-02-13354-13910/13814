*At present* there is no encryption system routinely used with cellphones,
but I was discussing the proposed GSM standard.  Your view that the cellphone
to base-station path is unencrypted correctly describes the current situation
(indeed, no part of the path is encrypted) but does not apply to GSM.
Loosely quoting from an article published in the 23/1/93 issue of New
Scientist:

  *  A GEC-Marconi scrambler called the CPU-100 is fitted into the cellphone
     between the handset and the transceiver.

  *  Cellnet's receiving stations are equipped with descramblers which
     convert the signal back into normal speech before feeding them into
     the telephone network.

  *  Calls between two CPU-100 equipped cellphones are transmitted in clear
     over land-line between the two relevant cellnet base-stations.

Yes, inversion scramblers have been around for years.  Anyone with matching
equipment can unscramble the call, and people can even learn to recognise
what is being said in the encrypted signal!  The military may well have much
more sophisticated equipment.  But using such devices on the land-line part
of the link is *not* part of the GSM standard.

On my understanding, you are wrong.  There is no provision in GSM for land-
line signals to be encrypted - just the radio signals.  To recap, the
proposal for GSM is as follows:

The reason a warrant is needed is that to monitor land-lines you have to
physically attach equipment - this sort of thing is generally noticeable
if performed on a *regular* basis.  Or are you suggesting that
non-governmental surveillance should be permissible without a warrant?

You'd need higher gain, but you could afford poorer directional
characteristics.  There's a limit to how many steerable high-gain antennae
you can put on a satellite - and in any case, does the UK have such a beast?
I saw somewhere that one of the UK providers handles 3 million calls a week
(that's around 5 a second) - assuming an average call length of a minute
that's 300 simultaneous calls on average (peaking very much higher around
London on a weekday afternoon...).  And, unless you want to go searching
for a needle in a haystack, you need to keep track of every cellphone during
its periodic announcements of position - do you really think it feasible
that there is that much satellite monitoring equipment available?  As I
said in an earlier posting, a much more likely hypothesis is that they want
to be able to monitor domestic targets by driving around behind them.

I wouldn't wish to.  But any half-baked third-world dictator could go down
this route with a few palmtops connected to military transceivers.  I was
trying to point out that the idea of hostile nations buying cellphones to
get high-grade security on the cheap was pretty much of a red herring.  They
might just use them if available - I certainly wouldn't, even with the
secure A5, unless the information had a lifetime of a week or less (even A5
can be broken in about a month).  The point is that dropping A5 for A5X will
not *stop* foreign powers gaining secure communications one way or another.

It's not my fixation, but GCHQ's.  Their argument is that they need a weak
encryption for GSM so they can monitor cellular calls - I'm pointing out
that they do not need weak encryption since they can tap the unscrambled
land-line side of the call (provided they have a warrant).  However, they do
have a valid concern about criminals stripping cellphones to gain a
(relatively) secure land-line voice capability - something which is *not*
legitimately available outside the military/security services (because GCHQ
forbids the sale or use of such equipment).  I can sympathise with their
horror at the thought of such encryption becoming *widely* available to the
criminal fraternity - I just think there are better ways of preventing such
abuse than by weakening the encryption, like making the protocol for
exchanging Diffie-Hellman keys so one-sided that there's no way of making
two CPU-100 chips communicate without an intermediary (which would only be
available to cellular providers).

Well, I do get the impression that we're either at cross-purposes or one of
us has missed some really crucial point.  Given that you seem to have
hands-on familiarity with phone scramblers and I've only read about them, it
could well be me. :-(

I think you would be more amazed at just how *few* people I credit with
having any sense. :-)

I agree with the necessity, but I do not like the idea of casual monitoring
`on spec' as this removes all possibility of governmental control.  I can
well believe that the police or MI5 could cook up a false argument for
tapping my phone and get a warrant, but if they did it wholesale they would
find questions being asked, like `Why have you requested 3 million warrants
this week?...' :-)

There's no way you could enforce a rule which said `don't listen in to
unscrambled cellular calls'.  But, by adopting an encryption system which
cannot *easily* be broken, thereby forcing them to tap the land-line instead
(which requires a warrant), you *can* achieve control over the tapping of
GSM calls.

I don't have a cellphone, so it doesn't affect me in that way (and I've got
enough sense not to incriminate myself if I did have one).  However, MPs
are prone to a touch of the naughties, and I can well imagine that they
might phone their lovers from the car to let them know they were on the
way (please feel free to modify the scenario to fit your local elected
representative).  And I *am* worried about the possibility of the security
services perverting democracy by blackmailing MPs over indiscretions.  Try
asking yourself what sort of person the Home Secretary is unlikely to grant
tapping warrants on, and why it might be a bad idea if GCHQ could listen in
without a warrant).  BTW, I'm not advocating that our elected representatives
should conduct themselves in such a manner, it's just that if they are to be
caught doing so, it should be dealt with in a legal fashion instead of
exposing them to underhand manipulation by the security services.

It takes only a nudge for a legitimate concern by the security services
about subversive activities to become a wholesale pogrom - look at
McCarthyism, the rise of Hitler, the creation of the KGB...  The UK security
services have already had their fingers rapped about the number of phones
they tap, and that's when they have to get a warrant to do it...

Yes, but one of the choices you can make is whether to use an ordinary phone,
an unscrambled cellphone, or (in the future) a scrambled cellphone.  You have
to form your own judgement as to how secure each of these methods are, what
degree of trust you place in it, and what sort of information you send over
it.  But at least the choice is there.

> Indeed, were an offer to do so be made, I probably could not rely upon it.

You use PGP - have you thoroughly checked out every line of code, or have
you made a value judgement as to what degree of reliance you place on it -
just as many people will do when presented with a purported security system
for cellphones.

You seem to be using privacy to mean `weak security' - government can listen
in but not the general public.  In fact, privacy is a means of obtaining
security - but this is playing with words.  If it needs a warrant
to tap my phone, a warrant to bug my home, and a warrant to search my home,
then I'm not happy that they can listen to my cellular calls without any
*effective* controls applying - `No, Home Secretary, of course we wouldn't
eavesdrop on unscrambled cellular calls without a warrant...' :-)

It only reduces your privacy and security if you're foolish enough to use A5X
to convey secure information.  But that's no reason for dismissing the
proposed downgrade as unimportant.

> IMO there are other and more important battles to fight than this one.

Depends on your priorities of course.  I am particularly concerned about the
potential blackmail of MPs by the security services, which could have some
quite unpleasant consequences.  It is also the thin end of the wedge - I
can see the possibility some years from now of an argument that warrants
should no longer be necessary for land-lines because cellular calls don't
require them.  In fact, there's a good possibility that eventually fixed
phones will go the same way as the telegraph because cellphones are getting
cheaper, more convenient and more popular, so it's even more important that
we get the ground rules sorted out now.

Well, you raised some interesting points, so at the risk of incurring
everyone's wrath I'll take you up on that and post.

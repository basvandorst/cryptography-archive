How about this for a 'statistical' argument...

A legal tap is placed at the Central Office (CO, that's what we in the States
call the place where the wires end up) on the wires that lead directly
to your phone.  Easy and requires very little equipment.

The largest buyers of telcom tapping equipment are law enforcement agencies,
according to contacts I have in the industry.  This type of equipment 
is usually not needed if the tap is done at the CO.

Interestingly enough, these buyers lately have been very interested in
test equipment which generates telcom tones used in non-US switches...
I wonder what that means? ;-[

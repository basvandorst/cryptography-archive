Hello,

I am looking for articles on meathods of finding prime numbers. I read in the
December 1992 (?) issue of Discover that the new record setting prime was
found using 2^n -1 and looking at large integers for n.

If there is a FAQ on prime numbers or an e-zine I would like to know. I would
also like to stay in touch via e mail with other prime finders.

If you have any interesting methods of prime finding I would like to hear about
them. Thank you in advance.

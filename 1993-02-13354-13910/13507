I am looking for device drivers which implement encryption of any kind on
random access block or character devices, specifically hard drives.
I would also be interested in sequential device encrypters.
Specifically, I would like to play with ISA-based drivers (IBM compat).
However, my posts on linux and 386bsd groups was received with little
interest.  The encryption algoithm used is of little or no
importance.  Thanks.

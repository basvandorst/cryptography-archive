I am a little confused by the key revokation post by John Perry.

Just out of curiousity, I ran this message through pgp.

The first time, pgp unpacked the outer signed message and output the
following to the screen:

Good signature from user "John A. Perry <home - perry@jpunix.com>".
Signature made 1993/02/17 18:53 GMT

The second time, I ran pgp on the output from the first run and got the
following message on the screen:

Good signature from user "John A. Perry <home - perry@jpunix.com>".
Signature made 1993/02/03 21:51 GMT

What I don't understand is why didn't Vesselin sign the outer message?
It seems that a letter from Vesselin which is signed by John is not
a secure way to revoke a key.  I`m not worried about the security of
messages to/from John personally, but I do worry that we will all
become accustomed to sloppy procedures such as this.  If so, someday
someone will forge a message like this to cause someone else's key
to be revoked.

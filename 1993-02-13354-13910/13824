Thanks, and apologies.  After fixing the code, here's the new results:

result 012 = 147911
result 021 = 184700
result 102 = 185064
result 120 = 185953
result 201 = 148152
result 210 = 148220

So it seems to be "bad" by having the winners overrepresented
by over 10%, while the losers are underrepresented by a corresponding
amount.  Plenty enough to screw up all manner of things.

Help!  I have tried again and again to get PGP 2.1 to work on my system,
but it always crashes.  I have gotten it from several FTP sites, unzipped
it successfully (at least I think so, since the text files turn out fine)
and gotten it to my 386 at home, just to have it crash as soon as I try
to run pgp.exe.

Any ideas?  Can someone suggest a site with a known good copy?  Or might
there be some subtle mistake I'm making?  (Yes, I always use binary
transfer.)  Please help.

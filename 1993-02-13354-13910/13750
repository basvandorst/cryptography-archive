I'd hope that cellular phone designers would not make mobile terminals
that constantly communicate with the cell base part of the system when
a car's electrical circuits are turned on, but only when the system
is "off the hook" (preparing to make a phone call).

The proper response, I'd think, would be "We'll get the local cellular
provider(s) to give us the phone number of that customer, then we'll
get the warrant for that number."

The extreme case of eavesdropping reportedly happened in the UK, in
which when a 150 khz tone was applied to the phone line's wires from
the central office, conversations in the house could be heard, even
though the phone was hung up. Nasty indeed!

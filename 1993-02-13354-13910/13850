     Does anyone [perhaps IBM] have the various information
       [S-boxes, key-schedules, Init Perms, ...]  that was in the 
     proposed 112-bit DES scheme that was "rejected" by the NSA ?

    Somewhere somebody mentioned that it was "no stronger" than 56-bit DES
     and I'd like to look at it and see why...

No.  First of all, Diffie-Hellman is a key exchange protocol, not a
cipher.  It doesn't matter how well you do your key exchange if you
use the negotiated value to generate, say, a monoalphabetic substitution.
Conversely, even Diffie-Hellman can be implemented with too small a
modulus.  Sun did that -- their implementation of D-H for secure RPC
was cryptanalyzed -- see

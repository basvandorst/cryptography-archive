For all the nubies out there, the above process is usually described as
a 'one-time pad'.  If you use something like an XOR against a pad (key)
of hopefully random digits and you never re-use the same pad, then the
only way the message can be decrypted is by stealing a copy of the pad.

This is the most secure method known of transmitting messages.

What you want is a cryptographically secure "hash" of some unique but
repeatable identification information.

I'm gonna tackle it backwards...

It's the *second* part that's gonna be rough.  You'll have to choose
information which is unique to a person, yet you must be sure that they
will always give that information in the *exact* *same* *way* to the
hash function, or you'll get multiple entries for some people.

Name is tricky... I wouldn't use it, not even phonetically.  Names change,
and sometimes people will even spell their names differently!  Misspellings
of even one letter would completely alter the hash, and prevent you from
eliminating such multiple entries.

Date of birth (DOB) is a good start, but not enough in itself obviously.
I'd include it in the information-to-hash.

The Social Security Number isn't such a good idea either...
	A.) The Privacy Act may prohibit you from requiring them
		to tell you their SSN... Then what will you hash??
	B.) Believe it or not, some people just don't *have* SSN's.

Things that don't change would be, Date of birth, Sex (at birth),
and, uh, er, um...  Good luck.  Maybe the SSN could be used anyway...

Oh, wait!  How 'bout insignificant family details?
A.) How many brothers & sisters did your father & mother have?
    [That's four separate numbers.]  (Count both living and dead alike.
    It's very unlikely that a patient's *grandparents* will have any more
    children.  Yet it's likely that a patient can count them, if known.)
B.) What are your father's initials (*all* of them). Your mother's?
etc.


The first part is easy... the best (most irreversible, most unique)
"hash function" that I know of is RSA's "MD5" (Message Digest algorithm
number 5).  It's in the public domain too, so it won't cost you a cent!

You may wish to contact someone who is familiar with cryptographic
programming to actually implement it though.  You could contact someone
at RSA, but I'd personally refer you to Phil Zimmermann.

Linda De Los Reyes (Sales Representative, RSA Data Security, Inc.) has
pestered me enough times to merit the mention that you can contact her
via e-mail at "LINDA@RSA.COM".  Tell her I sent you, and maybe she'll
give me a button or something. ;-)

Phil wrote the original Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) package which
introduced public key cryptography to the general public in a way
they could *use*.  He's a Software Engineering Consultant with
18 years of experience, who specializes in embedded real-time systems,
cryptography, and implementation of authentication systems for financial
information networks, network data security, key management protocols,
embedded real-time multitasking executives, operating systems, and
local area networks.

Custom versions of cryptography and authentication products and
public key implementations such as the NIST DSS are available from
Zimmermann, as well as custom product development services.  His

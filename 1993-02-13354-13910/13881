The algorithm that was previously posted randomly shuffles a deck in
one pass and uses only 51 random numbers to shuffle a 52-card deck. If
you insist on one random number per card, you can change the lower
bound of the loop to 1 instead of 2, which results in card 1 being
swapped with itself.  This has no effect on the results except to use
up another random number.

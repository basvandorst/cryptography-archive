If pgp had used something like a X-PGP-Signature: line, then
news-readers could have been instructed to ignore (hide) the sig lines
for those who wouldn't care to look at (let alone verify) sigs on each
and every pgp post.  Making our tools work together is a good thing.

Anyhow, I've set the Followup-To: to alt.security.pgp -- how about
keeping pgp user-interface/engineering junk off of sci.crypt so
there'd be more science here?

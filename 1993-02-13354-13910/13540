My apology if my post seemed offensive.  It seemed to me from the
original post that no in-depth study was really requested; the need
was for digits, quick and dirty.

Like this?

    given A>0, find r>0 such that r*r=A:

	let r = A
	recursively let r = (r+A/r)/2 until there is little change

The number of correct digits roughly doubles with each iteration.  If you
start with a better guess for r, it goes faster.

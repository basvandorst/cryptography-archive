   I'm not a cryptographer, so I may be totally off the wall, but it
       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   seems to me that the security of the data would be more at risk 
   if you use RSA for the entire encryption mechanism.

   I base this on the assumption that the more data that is available 
   that has been encrypted by the encryption algorithm, the more likely

Justify this assumption.  You might be correct, but I don't find
it obvious.

   it is going to be broken.  This is especially true if the data is
   somewhat predictable (a paragraph, shuch as this one, is much more
   predictable than a random sequence of bytes).

Justify this assumption as well.

   Using RSA to encrypt a random key and using the random key to 
   encrypt the message looks like it will make it harder to bust RSA
   and because the key is random, even if you break one message, it
   won't help you break another (unless the random number generator
   is itself predictable).

I agree with the second half of this (from "and because the key is").

   To make it mainstream usable, the response time needs to get down 
   near 2 seconds.  Most people don't have two minutes to wait for each
   message.  Asking them to do so, will just end up in frustration or
   non-use.

Agreed.  Ask them to get a real computer 8-)

   But the attach on either system should be much harder due to the 
   randomness of the key for the second system.

Why?  Justify this claim.

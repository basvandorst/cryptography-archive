     Sure, a stream cipher with a simple linear generator and an
     additive combiner is going to be easy to attack.  So don't do
     that.

     Instead, make sure that the generator has a large internal state
     and initialize it arbitrarily from a large message key; somehow
     modify the sequence from the generator to make it "nonlinear";
     use a nonlinear (but balanced!) combiner; use multiple combiners.

     Once we have decent nonlinear combiners, we can use them in
     series, and also select from an array of such combiners in a
     "polyalphabetic" manner.  Both of these approaches would be silly
     for an additive combiner (in most cases), so a good nonlinear
     combiner can add vast new dimensions to stream cipher design.

Yes, but the question was about combining with a simple xor, as
crypto-neophytes re-invent all the time and post to the group
every few months.

Nonlinear combiners have to be designed carefully too, of course,
but should be easy to make resist such a simpleminded attack.
Then we have to start worrying about more sophisticated attacks,
and are on our way to re-inventing DES/RC4/IDEA/etc.

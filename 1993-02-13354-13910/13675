As others have posted, this is far from a generally accepted view.

Not the case.  Numerous studies point to the INcrease of aggressive
behavior when the target is anonymous.  The less 'personal' the other
side seems, the easier it is to treat it as wrong/bad/evil/stupid/etc.

It also removes the useful tool of knowing when someone with valid and
good experience speaks good advice.  You would but everyone on the same
footing and remove the signs of wisdom from those who demonstrate it.

Leaving aside the supposition about the expected normalcy of anon postings,
I for one have enough trouble winnowing the wheat from the chaff when I
have the use of personal IDs for assistance.  There are many people on the
net who have yet to present evidence of intelligent thought, and I'd just
as soon not be required to page through their drivel just to read the
good stuff.  Until a content-based killfile (or keepfile) method is found,
I want as much info as I can get about the identity of a poster to help
me decide if I want to read more of their postings.

                               Principal Lecturer
                                 Carl Pomerance
                              University of Georgia


                                To be held at:
                         North Dakota State University
                              Fargo, North Dakota
                              July 26 -- 30, 1993


The Program:
How quickly can you decide if some given number is prime?  How hard
is it to factor big numbers?  Although not new questions, they have
taken on a certain urgency over the last 15 years with the rise of 
public key cryptography.  In this seminar, aimed primarily at college
teachers of mathematical sciences, these and other issues will be discussed.
Professor Pomerance will deliver 10 lectures covering such topics
as primality testing and Carmichael numbers, integer factoring,
discrete logarithms, and cryptographic systems based on the stupidity
of number theorists.  Some of these topics are particularly well
suited for inclusion in the undergraduate curriculum.

Professor Pomerance will also give a address to the general public on
the subject of cryptography.
Sessions allowing for a small number of contributed papers or presentations
will also be held.
There will also be an afternoon/evening excursion for participants and
families, as well as the traditional Thursday evening banquet.


The Principal Lecturer:
Professor Carl Pomerance is Professor of 
Mathematics at the University of Georgia. 
He received his Ph.D. in 1972
for the thesis: "An odd perfect prime is divisible by at least seven
primes", written
under the direction of John Tate. 
In 1985, he won the MAA Chauvenet Prize
for expository writing for his paper:
"Recent developments in primality testing", Mathematical Intellingencer
3(1981), 97--105.
He was the co--chair of the 1990--1991 academic year in algorithmic number
theory at the Institute for Advanced Study.


Conference Site Information:
Fargo is the eastern gateway to the northern Great Plains.
Lying in the southern end of the Red River Valley,
the lake bed of ancient Lake Agassiz, it is conveniently
situated stopping place for travellers bound  for 
the rugged and beautiful Theodore Roosevelt National Park
in North Dakota's colorful badlands
as well as
Yellowstone and
Glacier National Parks. %as well as the Great Canadian Shield Area.
Furthermore, it lies a short distance from Lake Itasca -- the source
of the Mississippi, and the Minnesota North Woods and Lakes Region 
and the Great Canadian Shield area.


Together with its twin city of Moorhead, Fargo constitutes
a metropolitan area of over
150,000 persons. 
Fargo is the host every summer to the renown Trollwood Music Festival.
Art galleries, museums, historical sites, and jazz performances
are a few of the many attractions available to the summer visitor.

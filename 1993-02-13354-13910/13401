Very quick question, what are the legal and commercial restrictions
on using particular encryption algorithms?? I'm refering to their
use by a company in a product rather than personal use. For instance,
I believe that RSA is actually owned by RSA Corp. (?) and would require
royalties to be paid. DES is restricted for use in certain places
by US legislation??

Are these true? Are there "free" use algorithms??

Thanks - George Bolt

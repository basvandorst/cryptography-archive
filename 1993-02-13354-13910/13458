I would caution you to double-check your requirements.  If all you want to do
is avoid people from simply browsing the file with an editor, then Rot-13
will do the job.

If you want to discourage a concerted attack, you probably need something
fairly decent, possibly even to defeat 13 year old hackers.

Before you knowingly adopt a "weak" crypto-system, it might be well for you to
consider (and, if you can do so, tell us) exactly who you are trying to defeat
with this known-weak-cryptosystem concept.  Also, if this is a password
protocol thing, implementation mistakes may make cryptography irrelevant.
Be nice to know what you are trying to do.  A lot of this stuff hangs
on triffles in the implementation, rather than on theoretical strength alone.
There's no point in encrypting at all if you make it too easy to defeat.

I would also point out that you don't necessarily have to have a poor
crypto-system just because the file has to be in ASCII.  It is a simple enough
matter to reencode arbitrary raw bytes into printable ASCII.

If the requirement is 1 to 1, then it may be that what you want is one of
the old "rotor" ciphers, which would probably still be beyond the means of
teenage hackers, at least, if it was done right.

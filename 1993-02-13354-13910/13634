It's the code I've posted here previously which uses MD5 as the block
transformation function in a CFB-mode stream cipher.  As I detailed in the
previous posting, it's at a minimum as strong as MD5 itself, but probably more
so due to its use of non-fixed "magic constants".
 
The main reasons I used it rather than, say, DES or IDEA are it's large key
size (2048 bits), large block size (128 bits), and the fact that it's not
patented or restricted in any manner.  Anyone can export or import it to and
from the US.  I'm even allowed to ftp my own code from a US site after I've put
it there!  (Of course the PKC code is a different matter).

This depends on whether I go to a protected-mode only version for the MSDOS
version (using a DOS extender).  With the addition of things like PEM/PKCS
support, more powerful encryption capabilities (key-and, key-or, key-quorom),
and various other odds and ends, I just don't think I can keep it going on a
resource-starved vanilla DOS environment :-(.

Peter.

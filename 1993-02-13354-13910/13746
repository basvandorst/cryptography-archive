RSA Data Security, inventor of these ciphers, has not publicly released 
descriptions of the algorithms.  It is possible to license source
or object code implementations from RSADSI, though.

Yes, the ciphers are supposed to be pretty good with longer keys.

Of course, RC2 and RC4 have not received much scrutiny, since the
algorithms are recent and are not generally known.  The fact that they 
were designed by well-known cryptologist Ron Rivest may instill some
confidence in them.  (Some say that RC stands for "Ron's Cipher".)

An article in the February 22 issue of Network World (p. 6) says
that the US Treasury will start requiring many participants to 
use electronic signatures in processing tax payments.  Not
digitized signatures, apparently, but public-key signatures, the kind
that make it impossible for one to deny having signed something.
According the story, eventually even individual taxpayers will have to 
use them.

The article does mention the pesky issue that those who use the 
signatures might owe royalties to RSA.  And it mentions that NSA 
authored the Digital Signature Standard which would be at the core of the
new requirement.

The Postal Service would be given the task of issuing the public-key 
certificates required for such a system.

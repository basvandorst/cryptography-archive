   Hi! Sorry if this is an FAQ; I've looked for an FAQ posting, here
   and in news.answers, but didn't see one. What I'm looking for
   is a simple encryption algorithm. It doesn't have to withstand
   10 gazillion exhausitve cracking efforts, and it doesn't have to
   meet any NSA/spook criteria for non-reversability; (if it does,
   great, but I'm not that worried about it). All I really need
   is an encryption algorithm for a short (16 characters?) string,
   that will serve as a first-line deterrent, so to speak. 
   Can anyone point me to a reference, or better still, a specific
   algorithm? Replies to e-mail, if possible, as I don't regularly
   read this group (I guess that was obvious...). I will monitor
   for a week or so, just in case. 

"rot13".

It's completely pointless.  If you have the real signature, you check
it against the message body, and there's no need for a shorter hash to
be included.  If you don't have the full signature, you can't check
anything.

There is already an integeration of cryptographically protected mail
with RFC 822 et al, and soon there will be an integration with RFC
1341.  But PGP decided not to use that standard; I got the idea there
were reasons, but never was clear on them.

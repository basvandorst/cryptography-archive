It is impossible to authenticate the person on the other end of the
connection unless the two of you share a secret.  This has nothing to do
with Public Key crypto.

If you share a secret, then you can use that secret to form a key for some
secret key cryptosystem like DES.  You can use that key just once to
encrypt (ie., authenticate) your public keys.  From then on, your public
keys take the place of the shared secret for authentication.

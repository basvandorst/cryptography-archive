Hello Everyone!

	This message is being sent to Vesselin for further
authentication before it is posted to sci.crypt and alt.security.pgp.

	When I first installed PGP on my system, several hours later I
had a hard-disk crash before I was able to backup my newly established
keyrings. I lost the keyrings and therefore was unable to generate a
revocation certificate. I now have a new keyring that is valid and is
the ONLY one I plan on using. Unfortunately, I sent the old key to
Vesselin for inclusion in his keyring as well as Ken van Wyk. The disk
crash happened a few minutes later. It took several days to rebuild the
disk and during this time, the old key was propagated throughout the
network on one of the LARGE public keyrings going around. At the time,
it was too late to notify Vesselin and Ken as I couldn't send email
until I recovered the system.

	If possible, I would like to request that if you have the old
key on your public keyring that you either delete it or ignore it in
future email with me.

OLD KEY - 0x76A3 - assigned to perry@phil.utmb.edu - PLEASE DELETE!
NEW KEY - 0xB199 - assigned to perry@jpunix.com with a a.k.a of
perry@phil.utmb.edu. This is the one I will use from now on.

	I apologize for any inconvenience to the network. If you have
any problems or questions, please email perry@jpunix.com or
perry@phil.utmb.edu

I've done just that will a varient on Phil Karn's DES software package
and in one or two other applications.  The first 8 bytes (well, 56
bits worth) of the MD5 digest are used as the DES key.  I also take
the other 8 bytes of the MD5 digest and use them to intialize the DES
CBC IV, rather than starting with 8 bytes of 0.

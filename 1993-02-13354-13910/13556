   The VCR-Plus system uses a hashed/compressed (?) integer to encode TV
   channel, date and time information. As you may know, this is a convenient
   tool for programming your VCR, ie, without experiencing the agony
   interface that most VCR mfgrs reinvent. (They're good at it.)

   But, I don't always have the Sunday TV section available.... So, is there
   a program to do generate this magic number?

   (I looked at two US ftp crypt sites and didn't see anything promising. I
   hope this hasn't been asked too many thousand times. :)

(black is 129.67.1.165)

Could some US sites pick this up please, to keep the
transatlantic traffic down.

This code is for US VCR+.  The UK uses a slightly different
scheme, which is being worked on now.  When we have it in good
shape, it will also be put up for anon-ftp.

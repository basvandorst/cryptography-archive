    Not to derail the direction of this thread, but this raises a
question re. the ITAR talk earlier:  Does *ANY* piece of software
using a 'key' greater than 40 bits in length come under jurisdiction
(i.e., cannot be exported without approval) - even though it may be
as lame as a 41 bit PRNG feeding an xor function?

   Conversely, is any system, no matter how sophisticated and well
designed, exempt from control, provided the key is 40 bits or less?

        Keep out everyone but members of _what_, exactly?

        I guess one could make alt.security.pgp into a moderated
        newsgroup, perhaps.  Or, when the new version comes along
        with multiple addressees, all posts could be encrypted to
        everyone on a mailing list, and therefore unreadable by
        others.

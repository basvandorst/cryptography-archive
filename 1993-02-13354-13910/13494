   The late 1960s was the time of Nixon and his abuse of wiretapping.

   Does this quote imply that in spite of the public outcry against
   Nixon's abuses, they are continuing today?  ...and that other governments
   are carrying them on as well?

Of course they are. Only a fool would believe that secret and
unaccountable government bodies like the NSA or GCHQ confine their
efforts towards SIGINT against their government's perceived enemies.
They have certainly targetted private citizens in the past and it
would be very naive to think they have stopped doing so now.

Maybe it would be easier to deal with this problem from the key server end.

Every so ofter, say from 3 months to a year, the server sends and automated 
message requesting you to "freshen" your public key by sending it a signed 
message.  Failure to do so, and the server revokes your key, and lets everyone
know that the key is no longer valid.

This would take care of accidents while preventing just anyone from revoking 
your key.  And it would get a little housekeeping done to boot.

Does this sound like a practical solution?

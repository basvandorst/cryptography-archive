I hope this is the right newsgroup for this question. I'm looking for what
might be called a "card-shuffling" algorithm, that will shuffle the contents
of an array in a highly-random manner. (The same seed number would produce the
same results, of course). The resulting array will be used in a substitution
cipher stage. Some time ago I read an article about "better" shuffling
algorithms, but I can't remember where. The plan is to take a login name, use
it as a key to encrypt the password, and not be a full-fledged DES. It will be
a 3-stage rotational cipher, like (I think) crypt.

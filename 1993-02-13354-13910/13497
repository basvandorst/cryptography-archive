I'll stick my neck out, and hope it doesn't get shot off (if you don't mind
the mixed metaphor).

The basic idea your propose is not new.  There was a paper in Cryptologia,
a few years back, suggesting that all 768 bits in the DES key schedule
be chosen independently, rather than being derived from a 56-bit key.
It didn't add much -- against differential cryptanalysis, it only
increased the work factor by a small amount.  And it has some negative
side-effects.

Right now, each key bit in DES affects all of the output bits.  Furthermore,
that's true by the fifth encryption round, out of 16.  This is very much
by design; the E-box, for example, is related to the permuted choices so
as to equalize the effects of each bit.  The result is that flipping any
key bit will, on average, change 50% of the bits in the output.

Suppose, though, that all 768 bits were chosen independently.  Clearly,
the later bits in the key schedule would have much less effect.  Some
of them, perhaps even many of them, would be recoverable very easily.
There would be many more bad key choices, and hence, a need for elaborate
rules on key construction.  (Not that that's new; the Hagelin cipher
machines had analagous constraints, if I recall correctly.)

So -- choosing all 832 subkey bits for IDEA increases the effort needed
for brute-force attack.  But that's not feasible anyway, not with a 128
bit key.  And it would seem to weaken the cipher under other, more
sophisticated attacks.  (In fact, my main concern about IDEA as a cipher
is how few times each key bit operates on each input bit, compared with
DES.  Has anyone done any studies of output sensitivity to key-bit
changes?)

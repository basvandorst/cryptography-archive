   I remember seeing a recommended general solution for your problem, though
it's of little use to you now.  Immediately after generating your key pair,
generate a key-revokation certificate.  Send it to someone you trust, perhaps
encrypted with IDEA so that you haveto give them a password/key to allow them
to revoke your key....

   Pardon my cynicism, but this strikes me as an extremely cheapskate way of
   doing your R&D and Q/A testing.  How about offering a prize of the order

   cryptographer/hr> - say, at a rough guess, $50,000 ? - after all, that's
   probably how much it would cost you to do the job yourself properly...



you don't have to accept the challenge.  this should be fun.


this is the first sci.crypt challenge that meets the requirements of
minimal disclosure in a very long time.  let them have their fun.  i
hope they post progress reports.

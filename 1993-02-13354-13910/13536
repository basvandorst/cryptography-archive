Yeah, but I still think the split was a good idea. There will probably be more
flame-fests in the future. And, I guess there are a large number of people in
the research community that have unsubscribed to the `sci.crypt' group. The
number of inapropriate posts are still too high (including this I guess), and
the flame-fests to frequent. 

A mailing-list would probably be a better solution, but I still support
a `sci.crypt' split.

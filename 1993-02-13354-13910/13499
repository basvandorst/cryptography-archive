I believe the NSA is accountable. They're just not accountable to the
public, except through selected and cleared legislators and an executive
oversight mechanism. They are also accountable throught the budget review
process, which has targeted secret operations for their share of cuts.

Though some argue that in some cases, secret agencies may go too far, it is
also true that to hint at or reveal the existence of certain perfectly
proper secret operations may destroy their usefulness. This is the source of
the tension between openness and national security, and it is not one on
which one may make black-and-white assertions as to either complete openness
or complete secrecy.

To take the most trivial example in the NSA's case, if it becomes known that
they have cracked the Freedonian Diplomatic Code, the Freedonians will
simply change it. Thus matters related to that activity, who's working on
it, what resources are given to it, etc. etc. all become "sensitive."

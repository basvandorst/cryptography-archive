You use the Chi-Square test with 9 degrees of freedom, but not with
the "normalized" frequencies, but with the actual counts instead.
Example:

Digit | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | Total
------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+------
Count | 99|101| 87| 94|110|102|116| 91| 94|106| 1000

The expected number of occurrences is 1000*0.1 = 100, so the
Chi-Square statistic is

	(1 + 1 + 169 + 36 + 100 + 4 + 256 + 81 + 36 + 36)/100,

or 7.2.  The significance is calculated by the Q function for the
Chi-Square distribution as Q (9/2, 7.2/2).  Since I don't have a table
handy, this calculation is left as an exercise to the reader :-)
(Tables for the Q function can be found in the Handbook of
Mathematical Functions, ed. by Abramowitz and Stegun.)

Have fun.

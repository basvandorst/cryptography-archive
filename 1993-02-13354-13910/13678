I personally don't believe that pseudonymous postings are appropriate in a
serious discussion area.  If there is a LEGITIMATE reason for concealing the
posters' identity, perhaps, but simply because they're not so sure if they
want their name attached doesn't qualify as LEGITIMATE in my book.  (Oh,
and if you can come up with a legitimate purpose for anonymous postings,
please, enlighten me.)

If one is not comfortable with the postings of his idea, and is not willing
to stand behind his ideas, what reason has he to push his ideas upon us?

This is NOT the 19th century, Usenet readers/posters are NOT likely to be
persecuted for a post with their name attached (and if they ARE, posting
to an anonymous source will do very little to prevent that), and it sounds
to me like you're trying to justify posting without responsibility under
the guise of "to keep us out of trouble".

Past experience has shown that the anonymous services have lent themselves
far more frequently to the abusers than the users.  I suppose you're also
opposed to the concept of Caller ID, full disclosure, and accountability of
public servants.

If you really want to see how reliable anonymous (or even "friend of a friend"
stories) are, take a look at the Enquirer, Weekly World News, or any of the
other tabloids that quote "reliable sources" or "unnamed informants" when
presenting their far-fetched and destructive stories.

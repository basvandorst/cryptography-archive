Last September, Gerben Wierda posted the following:

  I am reading "The Code Breakers". Many people talk about cyphers in a
  theoretical sense, but the test is in the cryptanalysis. So here is the
  cyphertext:

  And my question is this: Apart from talking theory here. Are there people who
  can solve this very simple system?

  I you can solve this you will know, why it cannot be used (hint, hint)


I solved it but no-one else has admitted to doing so, according to
Gerben.  Several others were interested and discussed it with me by
email (hi Uri 8-).

In the hope that this might be of interest to psychologists and
cryptanalysts, here's how I did it.  I hope that I'm not spoiling
people's fun, but you have had nearly 5 months to work on it.


First, the hint told me that the system is simple and effectively useless,
so it is likely to be a waste of time investigating Enigmas etc.

I counted letter and digram statistics.  Very similar to English, with
A and E swapped in frequency. Too many repeated letters, especially
SS.  First hypothesis: may be it's a transposition.  Not English,
though. Email to the author yielded two hints: it is *not* a standard
system (so simple transpositions are out) and the plaintext is
English.

Next step was to look for repeats in the ct.  There are only two of
length greater than 3, namely VWLS.  The similarity of this to the
word "vowels" was instantly noticed, with vowels omitted
(self-referential) but this was thought to be a co-incidence.  Second
mistake.  (The first was in exploring transposition ciphers).

I then re-formatted the ct as one line (here split for ease of viewing)

ATUUALTRRFAFVEAEOROEIUAYYWRDDASSBEUNDOARYYAE

I had a look at it and fancied that could see suggestions of English
words.  For instance, VWLS already mentioned; LTERS might be
"letters"; NOEOLESS might be "nonetheless"; NCCRABLTY might be
"incredibility" or "readability" and so on.

*If* this was significant, then the vowels are seriously mis-placed.
Hypothesis: the vowels have been removed from the plaintext and
re-inserted (pseudo-)randomly.  Test this by looking at the vowel-less ct.

GGVWLSSSSRNDMMNLSSTHSSWLLBFLLYYTTNHNCCRDBLTYYNNCNNDDTHHDBLNGGFFTHHLSTTLT
RRFFVRYYWRDDSSBNDRYY

Hmm.  Now, perhaps DLTNG is "deleting"; DBL is "double"; XPRSD is
"expressed"; BNDRYY is "boundary".  Note that each of these, and the
previous cases, *all* end in a doubled letter.  Insert a break after
each double letter to get:

BB DLTNGG VWLSS NDD DBLL LTRSS MSTT DSS CNN BB XPRSDD BTT THH XPRNCC 
SS MSTT NPLSNTT BB SNGG VWLSS SS RNDMM NLSS THSS WLL BFLL YY TT
NHNCC RDBLTYY NN CNN DD THH DBLNGG FF THH LSTT LTRR FF VRYY WRDD SS BNDRYY

It's now pretty obvious, to me at least, that the pt is

"? deleting vowels and double letters most ?? can ? expressed but the
experience ? most unpleasant.  ? ??? vowels ? random nulls this will
??? ? ? enhance readability ? can ? the doubling ? the last letter ?
every word ? boundary."

The ? indicate a known consonant, with unknown vowels to be filled in.
From context, we get:

"By deleting vowels and double letters most ideas can be expressed but
the experience is most unpleasant.  By using vowels as random nulls,
this will baffle you.  To enhance readability, one can do the doubling
of the last letter of every word's boundary."

This is the solution I sent off.  It had one mistake: the penultimate
"the" should have read "a".  As consonentless words disappear, they
must be replaced with some other flag; "th" was chosen, a bad choice
in my opinion, but it doesn't spoil the intelligibility of the
message.

Some of the reasons why this is a poor cipher-system:

	It is easy to break.  Took me about three hours work with
	a ct-only atack and only a few subtle hints.  I used only the
	very simplest of tools to do it and could easily have used
	pencil and paper only.

	There is no secret information (key) other than the method.

	It is not unambigously reversible.  For instance, "baffle"
	in the solution above could be replaced by "befool".  Although
	this particular example is of an unusual word with essentially
	the same meaning as the true solution, other examples needn't
	be so benign.  (Consider THEIR OTHER THREE).


To me, a great part of the pleasure in breaking this system was
observing the blind-alleys and contorted reasoning of the other
would-be solvers.  Further, those with a greater knowledge of
cryptanalysis than I found it difficult to shake of pre-conceptions of
how to solve cryptograms based on prior experience.

Finally, would anyone with a knowledge of Hebrew, Arabic and other
languages commonly written without vowels care to comment?

        One of the problems with PGP using strings of minus signs as
        separators is that a very large number of PC bulletin board
        mail networks (and their associated mail-tossing software)
        use a line with three minus signs followed by a carriage
        return to denote the separation between the message text and
        the various personal and network tags.  There is a definite
        risk of confusion.

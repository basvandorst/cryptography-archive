   It would be better for PGP to support the PEM RFCs.  If it did so then it
   would be trivial for MIME-compliant mail programs and newsreaders to use
   the MIME-PEM standard when it is finally released (it is currently
   available as an internet draft from your favorite RFC/internet-draft
   server.)

   I am not sure what is planned for the next release of PGP, but support for
   the PEM standard is an absolute MUST.  If it does not support PEM in the
   near future it will soon be discarded for programs that do as PEM usage
   becomes more widespread.  Think whatever you want about the PEM standard,
   but it is a real RFC defined internet standard and failure to support it
   ASAP will be a bad move...

I disagree with supporting the PEM RFCs (while I do support, in
theory, MIME compliancy).  Here is my reasoning.  The PEM RFCs were
made for including digital signatures in mail messages to enhance the
ability of accountability for mail messages.  Encryption was added in
later.

One of the design features of PGP is that the signature in a message
is INSIDE the encrytion.  This means that someone who captures the
message can only see to whom the message is encrypted, and NOT the
originator of the message.  This is useful for anonymity, since only
the intended recipients know who REALLY sent the message.

In addition, PEM doesn't allow for a signature-less message.  ALL
messages have to be signed, and it can optionally be encrypted.  PGP,
on the other hand, makes these two functions orthogonal.  (I should
add here that there are other packages, like RSADSI's TIPEM, which
does this, too).

The MIME compatibility is more interesting in that we could use MIME
as the transport mechanism, in lieu of the PGP Ascii armor.  Please
remember that PEM is not MIME, and MIME is not PEM, and luckily PGP is
not PEM!  The release is not planning on supporting PEM headers, which
is IMHO a *good* idea.  Hopefully they will consider adding MIME
compliancy, but that would be easy to create without much modification
to PGP itself.

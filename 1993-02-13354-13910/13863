     I have a book at home that discusses such a scheme, increasing the DES
key size to 64 bits and using the additional 8 bits to select among a larger
number of s-boxes (256, I think).  I'll try to post the reference in the next
few days.  I know the book is a collection of old Cryptologia articles, and
the article is entitled "Using Binary Derivatives to Test a New Version of DES"
or something similar to that.
 
     If I don't get back to you in the next couple days, mail me or something.

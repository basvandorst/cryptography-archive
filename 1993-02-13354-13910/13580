A recent article in Manchester Union Leader indicated that the NH Bar
has told lawyers that from an ethical standpoint they should not use
cellular phones when talking to clients unless the client is made aware
that the conversation is not secure, sort of a legal Miranda ruling.
In a similar vein, I met with a rep from a major cellular phone re-seller
who told me that there are currently one site TDMA trials underway with 
Ameritech in Chicago and Dallas (presumably SW Bell) that offers "encrypted"
cellular services.  I pressed him on the use of the word encrypted and he
insisted that it was not scrambling but was digital encryption/decryption.
Anyone know anything about this, who's equipment, what algorithm, etc?

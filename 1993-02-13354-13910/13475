For some time I have been considering designing a fast hardware
random number generator.  A quantum mechanical process such as
tunneling could provide _true_ randomness (?) rather than the
pseudo-randomness which is the best any algorithm can do.
The widget could attach to serial ports; another neat idea
might be to build in a simple XOR gate which combines the
random bit string with data coming from the host (of course
the random bit string also must be reported to the host for
this to be of any use).

Does anyone know of any such which already exist? I have
seen a few PC add-in boards, but they are slow (a few tens
of kbits per second) compared to what I had in mind.

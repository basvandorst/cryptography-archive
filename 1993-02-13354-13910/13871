Because the S-Boxes in DES were specially designed to frustrate differential 
cryptanalysis, it is now known that almost any change of the S-boxes- even
just changing their order- considerably weakens DES.  The S-boxes in the
standard are pretty much the best ones possible.

There were many papers on extending the key length of DES by altering the 
S-boxes before this was realized, but in the light of what is now known 
these are only of historical interest.

Andrew.

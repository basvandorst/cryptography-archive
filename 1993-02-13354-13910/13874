   What if the NSA proved that they were using RSA before RS&A came
   along?  It's certainly possible that NSA invented it first, but didn't
   tell anyone.  Seem like that would invalidate the patent (or would
   it?) and noone could claim royalties.

Someone told me there was an article in Science a couple months
ago saying public-key cryptography (algorithm not specified)
had been invented at Bell Labs in the 1960's but never deployed
or published because the NSA told them it was not workable.
Anyone know more about this?

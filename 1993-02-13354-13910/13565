 1.  MD5 sure looks complex, but that is hardly proof that the
     function is "cryptographically secure."

 2.  MD5 was designed to hash a large document into a smaller
     value.  It was *not* designed to be a "cryptographically
     secure random number generator."

 3.  This same sort of "secure random number generator" has been
     previously proposed using RSA as the one-way function.  Alas,
     Shamir [1] shows that while a one-way function may be
     difficult to invert for individual values, the same does not
     necessarily apply to sequences.

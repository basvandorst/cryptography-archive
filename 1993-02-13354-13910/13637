_____
<8.1> What is the value of anonymity?

  KONDARED@PURCCVM.BITNET:
    
  > I think anonymous posts do help in focusing our attention on the
  > content of one's message. Sure lot of anonymous posts are abusive
  > or frivolous but in most cases these are by users who find the
  > anon facility novel. Once the novelty wears off they are stopping
  > their pranks...

  morgan@engr.uky.edu (Wes Morgan):

  > I don't mind seeing the miscellaneous hatred/prejudice/racism;

  > providing anonymity's shield for these ideas repulses me.   If

  dclunie@pax.tpa.com.au (David Clunie)

  > question that in this rather conservative society that we live

  > ridicule, loss of status, employment, or even legal action. Given

  > what right do these detractors have to exercise such censorship ?

  From: doug@cc.ysu.edu (Doug Sewell)
  
  > Why is it censorship to not expect someone to speak for

  > lame argument.

  > Anonymous users have LESS rights than any others.  They are not
  > legitimate usenet participants. I would not honor RFDs, CFVs,
  > control messages, or votes from one.

  brad@clarinet.com (Brad Templeton):
  
  > I can think of no disadvantage caused by anon posting sites that
  > doesn't already exist, other than the fact that they do make more
  > naive net users who don't know how to post anonymously the old
  > way more prone to do it.

  From: mandel@netcom.com (Tom Mandel)
  
  > I cannot speak for others but I regard anonymous postings in a
  > serious discussion as pretty much worthless. ... views that hide 
  > behind the veil of anon are hardly worth the trouble of reading.
  
  From: 00acearl@leo.bsuvc.bsu.edu
  
  > Instead of making this a "free-er medium" by allowing posters to
  > "protect themselves" with anonymity, simply require that all
  > posters be prepared to discuss their sources of information and
  > take the heat for unsubstantiated dribble.  This seems to be the
  > way things are currently done; 

  xtkmg@trentu.ca (Kate Gregory):
  
  > In misc.kids there are three threads going on started by anonymous
  > posters. One was about changing jobs so as to work less hours,
  > job sharing and so on, from a woman who didn't want anyone at her
  > current place of work to know she was thinking of looking for
  > work elsewhere. The next was from a woman who is thinking of
  > having a baby sometime soon and doesn't want coworkers, friends,
  > family etc etc to know all about it, but who wants advice. The
  > third is about sex after parenthood -- actually this was started
  > by people posting in the usual way but then it was pointed out
  > that the anonymous posting service might let more people
  > participate.

  > Misc.kids doesn't seem to be suffering any harm from the presence

  hoey@zogwarg.etl.army.mil (Dan Hoey):
  
  > While there has never been any real security against anonymous or
  > forged postings on Usenet, the process has until now been
  > sufficiently inconvenient, error-prone, and undocumented to limit
  > its use by persons who have not learned the culture of the net.

  > On the other hand, a recent use of the anonymous posting service

  > homework problem. It has now been attributed to a teacher,
  > asking for an explanation of a dubious answer in his teaching
  > guide.  He says his news posting is broken, so he is using the
  > anonymous service as a mail-to-news gateway.

  red@redpoll.neoucom.edu (Richard E. Depew):

  > The consensus seems to be that a general anonymous posting service
  > such as that at anon.penet.fi seems sufficiently corrosive of the
  > trust and civility of the net that this particular experiment

  > and we stopped it." 

  dave@elxr.jpl.nasa.gov (Dave Hayes):

  > Do people really say different things to each other based upon

  Karl_Kleinpaste@cs.cmu.edu (Karl Kleinpaste):

  > Weak reasoning.
  > With freedom comes responsibility.

  dave@elxr.jpl.nasa.gov (Dave Hayes):
  
  > Responsibility isn't real if it is enforced. True responsibilty
  > comes with no coercion.

<8.2> Should anonymous posting to all groups be allowed?

<8.3> What should system operators do with anonymous postings?

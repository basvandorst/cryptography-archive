Why don't the security services just get a court order and tap the
stream at the cellular base stations? The mobile station ID is known to
the base station, so the info needed to find and tap the voice/data
stream will be there!

For surveillance in countries other than the agents' own export the
"weakened" ones or "quietly" tap the wired communications
infrastructure!

Hello -

I am interested in finding out the particulars of how the xsend
utility encrypts messages.  I understand that a knapsack cypher is
used, but I am looking for more detailed information.  We don't have
source for our Sun, ULTRIX, or NeXT systems (each of these platforms
has the xsend/xget/enroll utilities) and I have been unable to find
source code via archie.  Any pointers to source code or the algorithm
would be helpful.

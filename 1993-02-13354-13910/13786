It might help to think of the authentication problem as a continuum:

We are continually working to have a valid identity of even our best
friends: an authentic image, an accurate model of their capabilities,
reliability, etc.

A new person moves through a long series of authentications going from
stranger to friend.  This will be true whether it is an e-being or
physical presence being.

The need for a prior secret for authentication only helps if the persons
have already authenticated themselves at a personal level.  (or corporations,
etc.)

The real hard problem is how to authenticate a being you have never met.
Carl Ellison talked about some ofthis, using a private cypher, etc. indeed
can tie the message to an e-being.

But the larger problem is tying an e-being into a context, with cross-
authentication from known authentic, valid, etc. beings whose word you
can trust.  This has been discussed in the context of valid PGP keys,
to prevent spoofing.

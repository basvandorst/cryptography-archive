A question, because I am too lazy to walk twenty feet to the library and look this up myself.  Are there any algorhythms that will produce a few thousand figures to the right of the decimal for irrational square roots?  I need this to work on a SunSparcStation, so I assume it must work on a 32 bit system.  Does such a function exist?  I have heard mention of "Newton's Method", the "Babylonian method" and the "Chinese Remainder Theorem", but have not looked into these yet.  Thanks for your help.

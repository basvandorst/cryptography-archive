If it is gaussian white noise, then the prob distr of the fourier
coefficients is x e^(-x/s)^2. Ie it is very broad, and has a sizable
prob of being either twice or half of the mean size. Many people have
found "signals" in fourier transforms ( peaks in the transforms) that
were just noise.-- I e you have to do a decent statistical analysis on
the fourier coefficients. It is a way of finding correlations, but don't
be naive. ( the above was for the amplitude of the fourier transform-
for the individual transform coeffcients, they are in general gaussian
distributed).

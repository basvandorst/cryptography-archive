An area that I've looked at is examining typos and consistent spelling
errors, and punctuation.  If someone isn't going out of their way to
disguise their style, I think it should be possible to spot them from
a much smaller sample.  Most people's mistakes are distinctive; only
a group of consistently good spellers all writing in the same national
style (eg US English) with flawless punctuation would be hard to
distinguish.  Then the vocabulary/word-pair analysis the statistical
groups have studied would be more significant.

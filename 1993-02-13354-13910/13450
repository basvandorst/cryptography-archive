First, apologies to anyone who thought I was Finland bashing.  I did
not mean to imply Finland was capturing the traffic.  Again,
apologies for the imprecision of my statements.

I have conversed with Jyrki about what I really ment and he suggested
I post a clarification.

The traffic to and from Finland is relatively isolated and is, I
suspect, relatively easy for both the NSA and KGB to capture.

Anon posts are, by their nature, just the kind of stuff these folks
love -- information you don't want anyone else to know!  As Jyrki
points out, the NSA budget is larger than the entire Finnish
government budget!  Grabbing this kind of information is their job.

I would be quite suprised if these anon posts are not logged in Fort
Meade and somewhere in Russia.

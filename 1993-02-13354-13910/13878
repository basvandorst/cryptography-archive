Francois  Bergeron made a talk on  the subject at  the Algorithm seminar in
Inria  Rocquencourt.   The result  is  that  if  you  want  to  obtain  all
permutations  of  a  n-card  deck,  you  have  to  "shuffle"  it  at  least
ceil(log(n)/log(2)) times, that is 6 times for n=52.

A shuffle consists in cutting the deck after the k-th card,  and  shuffling
together both sub-decks, such that the order is  preserved in each one. For
exemple, a shuffle of 1 .. 10 is 1 2 6 3 7 8 4 9 5 10 (k=5).

With only one pass, you can shuffle a 2-card deck only.

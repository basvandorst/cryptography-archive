Okay, I'm definitely up to the challenge, but I feel I must ask something.
When I took your ciphertext message and slapped a "begin 666 unknown" and an
"end" on it, it could be uudecoded. The stuff that came out was, well, munge,
but still, it got me wondering. Is this co-incidence or what? I know you said
that the ciphertext is not uuencoded, but then could it really be a total
co-incidence that it can be read by the uudecoder?? ( come to think of it,
for it to be a real challenge, you aren't too likely to tell me/us are you?
:) )

Secondly, is anyone out there interested in collaborating on cracking this? I
must admit that I don't, right now, have the first clue what sort of cipher
system was used to encrypt this, so perhaps there are others out there who
would want to work on this as a team effort?

Regards,

Marc

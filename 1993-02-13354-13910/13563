[Cipher using XOR with PRNG...]

This works only if you take care to use a cryptograpically secure 
pseudo random number generator, such as MD5(k+1), MD5(k+2), MD5(k+3)..., 
where k is your key.  

Most PRNG's (like the C function rand(), or X=(a*X+b)%c) can be
broken in a known-plaintext attack by figuring out the state of the 
PRNG by looking at it's output.  Often, the amount of known (or guessed)
plaintext only has to be as many bits as the state (or the seed/key).

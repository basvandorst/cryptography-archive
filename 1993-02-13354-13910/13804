              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Nice theory, but too simple.

I can always deny signing something by claiming that my private key was
compromised.  I can even deliberately let it be known, if it's important
enough to get out of a signature.

The trick, I now suspect, is to have the same signature tied to something
(like my bank account) which I *really* want to keep private, so that the
penalty for compromise is severe and key privacy is self-enforcing.

Any other ways to achieve this?

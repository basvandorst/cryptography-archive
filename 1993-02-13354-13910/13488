      The book "Modern Machine Cryptograpy" is an amusing little work on
how to break WWII-vintage cyphers with modern techniques.  BASIC programs
are given.  Also has good, clear photos of crypto hardware from WWII.
Written around 1980.  Probably the best technical appreciation on how
Blechley Park actually worked.

p.s. no, I don't have the author's name or the ISBN number.

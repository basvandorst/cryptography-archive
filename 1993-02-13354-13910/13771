There are several examples of whistle-languages, but this wouldn't be
a cipher (just really hard to learn...) - only a code. Musical cues
was used as signals in radio broadcasts during the war, but this was
probably more of the kind "if they play that song after the 9 o'clock
news they are sending message number so-and-so".

Peter Wright's book "The Spycatcher's Encyclopedia of Espionage" do
have an entry "Music, as code messages" that you may enjoy reading.
(Is that book available in Britain?)

If you are interested in historical stuff you may find that there are a
few of the great classic composers that made up musical riddles and code
messages a few centuries ago. I guess Hofstaedter (sp?) would have covered
such things in "Goedel, Escher, Bach" or "Metamagical Themas".

I think there's a more recent case of encoding messages into the musical
score, but I cannot remember the reference.

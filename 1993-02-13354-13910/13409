At one of the Crypto conferences, I remember someone talking about someone
else who had requested time on a Cray computer to attempt to break DES 
with a neural net.  I don't think the request was granted.

The problem with using neural nets is figuring out what to reward.  Each bit
is going to be correct 50% of the time, on the average.  How do you judge
"almost correct"?

It's an interesting question, one I'm sure the spooks have played with, but
I don't know of anyone in the non-military world getting anywhere.

I while back, I was working on just such a piece of software, 
based on Barry Nance's DOS freeware DietDisk (a compression TSR like
Stacker).  I didn't get very far, backburnering the project out
of dismay at the uncommented code.  Still, DietDisk wouldn't
be a bad place to start for someone willing to dive into someone
else's 6000-line assembler program.  It's available on ripem.msu.edu
as pub/pc/dietdisk.zip.

A friend of mine has some arj files that he encrypted and forgot the password
to.  Is there any fully functional arj analogs to zipcrack out there?  He
could really use one.

Please to not give descriptions of the algorithm or cracking methods.  Even if
I were skillful enought ot employ them, the files are not important enough to
me to devote that kind of time.

Also, I beleive the files were created with version 2.39a, but i am not sure.

	I have a copy of a document that explains how "easy" it is to break teh wp50-51 passwording.  I still don't find it EASY as such, so I need to know whether there is an executable already made to do the decrypt (well, to spit out the appropriate password or at least salt code)
So, could someone give me the site and directory for such a thing, or mail me
it directly?  THANKS!!!

PLEASE reply via E-mail, as I am WAY behind in the group, and it is faster ANYWAY to mail.

Thanks again!!!

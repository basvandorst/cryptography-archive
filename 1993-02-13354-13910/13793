   What would be suitable encryption algorithm to use on a machine

   I am looking for something that is reasonably secure.

Any machine can handle numbers bigger than 32 bits - you're just
making a tradeoff between storing numbers in single words (nice for
hardware performance) or using more than one word to represent a number,
which lets you do operations on arbitrarily big numbers.

If you want something that *isn't* reasonably secure, the standard
Unix crypt program is there.  The folks at Bell Labs Research,
where it was originally written, moved it to /usr/games a few years back...
Anything that has 32-bit keys can be broken in 2**32 guesses at the password.  
If you've got an efficient algorithm that takes, say, 10 operations
to encrypt a word of data, your 10 MIPS machine can break than in 4000 seconds.

If you want something reasonably secure, and tolerably efficient, use DES.
It uses 56-bit keys, which are enough to stop everyone except maybe the NSA, 
people build decent hardware and software implementations of it,
and most of the world uses it (in spite of the US Government's pretense
that we're the only ones smart enough to write DES software implementations 
given the published algorithm.)  Look around on nic.funet.fi for code.

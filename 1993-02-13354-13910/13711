Good point Kevin! I guess we all need to start evaluating how to
handle such procedures. The message I got from Vesselin was unsigned
but I went ahead and posted it anyway in the hopes that the bad key
might have some chance of getting minimized. As we have all learned
from this, there isn't much hope anyway. Do you have any suggestions
on how the net should handle messages of a time/information critical
nature? Your posting got me to start thinking about overall procedures
in general. I don't have any answers yet, but at least we can all
start thinking/discussing it. Oh, by the way, the reason the message
was signed by me a second time is that my newsreader is set up to
automatically sign outgoing messages.

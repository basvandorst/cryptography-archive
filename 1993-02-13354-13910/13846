Yeah, sure.

If PKP were actually interested in making money by licensing their patents,
they could send out a press release saying "For $20 we'll send you a bit of
paper saying you're personally allowed to use the RSA algorithm".  Then all
they'd need to do would be employ a couple of secretaries to sit there and
collect the money.

RIPEM communication is already possible.  The license only prohibits
exporting RIPEM, it doesn't prohibit people in Europe from sharing copies
around once it has somehow made its way across the Atlantic.

Of course, given that you argued that it was morally wrong to use PGP because
it had at one stage been illegally exported, the consistent thing would be
for you to argue that it is now morally wrong to use RIPEM.

But somehow I doubt you'll do that.

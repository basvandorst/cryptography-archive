My understanding of the weaknesses of PseudoRNGs is that they can be
predicted from the sequence, independently of cycle length.  There
are a lot of academic paperso n this.  I haven't looked into it
deeply, but code crackers can tell the type of PRNG from the sequence,
then figure out the seed, etc.

I have _not_ seen discussions of what happens when you xor/add/genop
the output of different _classes_ of PRNGs.  This seems safe to me.

Nevertheless, I believe that the government does not permit the use of
XOR stream cyphers based on PRNGs for serious traffic.  This implies
a weakness in PRNGs or the XOR stream cypher.  Anybody know which?

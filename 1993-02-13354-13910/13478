The only thing I have seen anonymous mail and newsposts used for was
to attack someone without worrying about being seen as an ass to the
rest of the world.  That is, until now.

I have nothing wrong with anonymous mail and newsposts, but if someone
uses it as a wall to hide behind then they do have something to 
hide -- lack of character.

Note: this is not a flame.  Hank here is using the anonymous posting
service in a manner which most should not find bothersome.  He has
given everyone an alias to address him by (how does anyone know I'm
really Michael anyway?  :) and has not taken to openly insulting
people because he has a wall to hide behind.

I personally see nothing wrong with his posts.

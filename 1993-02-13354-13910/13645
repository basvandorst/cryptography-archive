   Please excuse the naivety of this question, I am brand new to
    this group and the ideas of cryptography.

   You and a friend send mail through a computer known to be in
    the employ of the Evil Empire.  This computer opens each message
    and looks first for any public keys.  Finding one, it stores it
    in a database, generates its own new public key, and forwards
    the new key on to the receipient.  Then as encoded messages come
    through, the computer uses its secret key to decode and store
    them, then the stored public key to re-encode and forward them.

   Is there any way to full the Evil Empire's machine, without
    going to a secondary route such as a phone call, to pass the
    key.  Even with an introducer, won't the computer grab the
    original key as it is passing from the originator to the
    intorducer?  BTW, I really *don't* know of any such
    installations, rather I would like to know if it is possible to
    establish secure communications, regardless of the steps taken
    by any particular server you might pass through.  Many thanks
    (in advance) for the replies!  :-) 

   Best regards,

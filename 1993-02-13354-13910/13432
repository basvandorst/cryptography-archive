Three questions:

1. I ftp'd RSAREF and extracted MD5 from it, and have compiled a program
which calculates MD5 hashes of files.  Are there any restrictions on my
use/distribution of this?

2. Some time ago I ftp'd a document that described MD4 and contained
source code implementing it, only my copy seems to be damaged, containing
the description but only the first hundred lines or so of the reference
implementation.  Does anyone have the whole thing?  It is no longer on
rsa.com.

3. I understand the 2 round 128 bit Snefru has been (partially) broken.
What is the status of the 4 round 256 bit version?  Is it considered
secure?  And was there ever a version beyond 2.2?

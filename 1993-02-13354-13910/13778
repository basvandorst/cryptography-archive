In this case, the proof lies in philosophy more than CS.  It all hinges on
the definition of "identity".

The intention, in authentication, is to establish the identity of the party
(person, computer, process, ...) at the other end of a connection.

Take me for example.  I've been posting to sci.crypt for a while now so
perhaps you "know" me -- but you have nothing with which to authenticate my
identity because I don't have an identity for you.  We have never met.

So -- now I give you a (RIPEM) public key for myself:

User: cme@ellisun.sw.stratus.com
PublicKeyInfo:
 MIGbMAoGBFUIAQECAgP+A4GMADCBiAKBgCl79/jl0DEVl1GQzOHlzjDmChDDxnWO
 Acd7jShj2x1vclFh6vbHx9IJqkQdwNhNAWf8XnTrqBDN+VSBc1qdT6nSEAbNPxHD
 XcvY2DudhuRaRBVLgUQ4scTK657m90Q+bTL5yIh2MaFipUw9BgbIXPTDlksSskWP
 9oHjo+pCJC+lAgMBAAE=
MD5OfPublicKey: 39D9860686A9F075A9A83D49589C677A

You now know more about "me".  In fact, the public key defines "me" because
it's effectively guaranteed unique while the name "Carl Ellison" certainly
isn't unique.

Now all you know is that there exists such a key and presumably someone
knows the private key for it.  If I sign a message and you use the public
key to verify that signature, then you *know* that someone knows the private
key.

If I use that private key to sign a message and post it -- and if in that
message I state things about myself -- then I can flesh out my "identity".
Still, I am doing nothing which authenticates me to you.  I'm establishing
that identity, not verifying a prior identity.  I could even be lying about
my being an incredibly handsome hunk over whom women are constantly draping
themselves whenever they get the chance....or I could be telling the truth.
All you can tell is that the same "person" made two or more statements, all
signed with the same key.  That establishes a relationship between multiple
messages.  That's all that can ever be established -- a relationship.

If you want to establish a relationship between a message and a person,
then you need somehow to enclose the person (or some portion of the person
which can not be removed from the person) in a message.  Our relationship-
establishing machinery works only on messages.  Therefore, you need
information which is locked to the person.  In other words, that the
information is private to the person.

However, private information (the "fact" that my best friend at age 6 was
named Fred) doesn't help you.  You can't tell that that is true.  It might
be false.  In fact, it is false (or is it? :-).  The private information
needs to be something you also know.  However, it needs to be something no
one else knows, otherwise that 3rd person could be masquerading as me.

So -- we've established that there is some information private to me and to
you and to no one else.  This is a defintion of "secret shared between us".



I didn't have to use public key crypto to do this -- but if I used
secret-key methods to sign messages which would then establish a
relationship between them, you and I alone would need to share the secret
key, so that would be our shared secret and the proof would be trivial.



Of course, I could be a corporate being.  You don't know that I'm keeping
my key private.  I might be 5 different people, cooperating.  ...job
sharing, you know. :-)

What do you intend to mean by the word "identity"?

---------

Sorry -- that's the closest I can come to a proof at the moment.  If I
tried really hard, I might make it look mathematical, but it would be a
tautology by the time I defined "identity".

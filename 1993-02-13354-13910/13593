Greetings to you all Computer Security gurus,

I have corresponded with several current researchers in the industry
regarding doing graduate research in the area of Computer Security.
However, I want to hear from more people who are working and/or doing
research in this field.

Specifically, I am interested to know if this subfield of Computer
Science will become a booming area or will it subside as products find
ways to increase security. How much research is enough in this area?
Will there be a steady need for researchers in this field or will the
field saturate pretty quickly?

In terms of making a living in this area, how feasible is that? I would
be very interested to know the estimate(s) of entry-level pay scales for
M.S. and Ph.D. in Computer Science, specializing in Computer Security. 
Are there entry-level jobs in this area at all? I know industry people 
should be more in-tuned to answer this question.

If one is interested in entering this field, which area of Security
would be highly recommended? Why? What are the foreseeable needs?

What are the basic readings recommended for graduate research and what
are the current-topics readings?

Any other questions that I may have left out and you would like to share
with me would be very welcomed.

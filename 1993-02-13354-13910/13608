The reason chosen-message attacks aren't a major worry for digital signatures
is that most implementations don't sign the actual mesage, but only a
'fingerprint' (usually called a MAC or message digest) of the message.  In
order to have a chosen-message attack, you have to be able to generate
arbitrary message digests, and if you can do that you don't need to attack
the signature scheme at all but can simply substitute a piece of text with the
required message digest.

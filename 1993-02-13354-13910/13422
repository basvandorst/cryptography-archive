Ah, but this is exactly how cellular systems work! The cells are
connected to a Mobile Telephone Switching Office (MTSO). The MTSO
in turn connects to the public switched telephone network (PSTN).
As a user moves from cell to cell, the MTSO switches cells but as long
as the call stays up it keeps using the same trunk to the PSTN.

No matter how securely cell phones were to encrypt their air links
(i.e., the link between the mobile and the MTSO) a call could
still be intercepted on the trunk into the PSTN. But because this
requires physical access to telco facilities (the trunks) the telco
would presumably demand a warrant from law enforcement before cooperating.
Intercepting an unencrypted call over the air, however, can be done without
the knowledge or consent of the telco. I wonder what this says about
the NSA's successful push to stop meaningful air link encryption in the
new generation of digital cellular standards.

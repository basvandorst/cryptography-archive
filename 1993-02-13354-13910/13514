Well, sooner or later users will dump MS-DOS for a better OS - which
will be multi-user, multi-port, multi-process, etc. If we don't want
the same to happen with PGP, we'd better do something about it NOW...

Yes, but you MAY mix them. OK, I agree with you that making PGP
-entirely- PEM-compatible might not be a wise move. Then, how about
making it as much compatible as possible? E.g. in cases when you -do-
sign your messages, why not having the option to produce a
PEM-compatible result?

Well, that would be fine for many people - make them as compatible as
possible, without breaking things...

But you'll get even more users, if PGP becomes at least as much
PEM-compatible as possible...

Hi! Sorry if this is an FAQ; I've looked for an FAQ posting, here
and in news.answers, but didn't see one. What I'm looking for
is a simple encryption algorithm. It doesn't have to withstand
10 gazillion exhausitve cracking efforts, and it doesn't have to
meet any NSA/spook criteria for non-reversability; (if it does,
great, but I'm not that worried about it). All I really need
is an encryption algorithm for a short (16 characters?) string,
that will serve as a first-line deterrent, so to speak. 
Can anyone point me to a reference, or better still, a specific
algorithm? Replies to e-mail, if possible, as I don't regularly
read this group (I guess that was obvious...). I will monitor
for a week or so, just in case. 

Thanks in advance,

Troy Brooks

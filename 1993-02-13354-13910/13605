Obviously, XORing with a PRNG is a good cipher -- *if* the random
number generator is cryptographically strongly, and *if* the traffic
characteristics are suitable for that type of cipher.

DES in output feedback mode is a good example.  It's an officially-
blessed mode of operation, and it is a very good random number generator.
But OFB has two serious weaknesses.  First, if byte synchronization is
ever lost, it can't be regained.  Second, an opponent can make predictable
changes in the plaintext.  Depending on the checksum algorithm used,
an enemy might even be able to correct it to compensate.

A good discussion of the properties of OFB (and of the other DES modes)
can be found in Davies and Price's ``Security for Computer Networks''.

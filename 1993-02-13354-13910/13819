Two good papers on this are by David Chaum:

   "Security Without Identification: Transaction Systems to Make
    Big Brother Obsolete" in the October 1985 issue of the Communications
    of the ACM (Vol 28 No 10).

   "Untraceable Electronic Cash" in (I think) Crypto '89 (It might have
   been Crypto '88, '90, or later...)

Yes, although the first paper's method for preventing counterfeits is (IMHO)
rather counter to the whole idea of untraceable money (the purchaser basically
has to wait until the merchant calls the bank to verify the money hasn't
already been spent).

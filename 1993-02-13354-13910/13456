Sorry if this has been covered recently before in this group as I
don't often read it.

I was surprised recently to see in Dr Dobb's Journal an article on
the LUC public-key encryption algorithm, which I had never heard of
before.  Apparently it is the same as RSA but uses Lucas functions
instead of exponentiation.

The author contended that it was at least as efficient as RSA (if
more difficult to code).  More interestingly he said it was more
secure because it was not multiplicative and hence not susceptible to
"adaptive chosen-message forgery".

Does anyone have references to other articles on this algorithm, or
any comments?

For the implementiation of discrete logarithm based protocolls I am 
looking for algorithm that generates primes p and primitive roots in
the multipl. finit group of Z mod p. The generation of a prime p is
easy (also with known factorisation), but to get a primitive root the
best algorithm I know is a ad hoc search (picking randomly an number between
1 and p-1 and test it). What other algorithms are known?

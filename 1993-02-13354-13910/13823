The meaning is obvious, to me, and sufficient.  Two messages signed with
key K1 can be assumed to have come from the same source (individual or
group).  That defines a relationship between the two messages.

I can't imagine anything else which signatures can establish.

This isn't the issue here, I believe.

I need only sign the bottom of my digital check with the same signature
that I used to deposit money in the account.  In fact, my public key should
be my account number, just to simplify programming and my name or any other
human tag for identity need not be involved at all -- need not even be in
the bank's records.

If the money is deposited for me (eg., by my employer doing EFT), then all
they have to do is sign their check with their signature and address it to
my account (ie., my public key).

There is no problem or ambiguity in this authentication.  No one has to
vouch for any identity relationship.

I don't see different interpretations here.  If I sign the following message:

"I believe that

then I've gone on record with a statement.  I could be telling the truth or
lying.  Either way, it doesn't matter.  From that message, you know two
names which need no authentication and you have one trustworthy statement
(for me) and one allegation (for Mark) giving human-spoken sounds which
those named people might use in everyday speech to refer to themselves.

That latter information (the name Carl for me) is something you probably
won't ever need, unless you happen to meet me in person, someday, or unless
you like to use such names in e-mail.

So -- what's the problem?

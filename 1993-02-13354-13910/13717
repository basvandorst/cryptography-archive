I think I know the program you are refering to, but it does not do
exactly what I described. Look, with the -AV breaking program for
version 1.1 that I was talking about, you give it a company name and
the three-letter part of the identifier and it outputs (in less than a
minute) ALL registration numbers that will produce the same company
name, the same three-letter part of the identifier and all possible
number-parts of the identifier. So, you have just to pick those of the
registration numbers that matches the three-digit part of the
identifier of the archive you are attacking. This registration number
-will- be present, so you can -always- crack the protection.

I suspect that the program you are talking about gets a company name
and outputs two registration numbers. If you use any of them, you'll
get the correct company namy, but the six-character identifier (3
letters and 3 digits) might not match. Am I right?

Vesselin

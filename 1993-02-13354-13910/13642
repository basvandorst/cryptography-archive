my compliments to dane butzer on actually providing a real challenge.
this will allow some known-plaintext work, considerable chosen
plain-text work (although not on the key used for the contest) as well
as an examination of the algorithms used.

then only small criticism might be about the restraint on compiling
the code.  considerable information might be gained by modifying the
source code to run various numerical experiments.  since you are
depending on honorable adherence to a confidential disclosure
agreement, it doesn't seem like a large step to allowing people to
compile your code, provided they agree to erase copies at the end of
the challenge.

in any case, bravo!

i hope you get a lot of interest.

In "A digital signature scheme secure against adaptive chosen-message
attacks" (SIAM J. Computing April 1988) and "How to sign given any
trapdoor permutation" (J. ACM January 1992), various authors have
presented schemes that are more robust against forgery than straight RSA
or other methods.  However, I haven't seen any evidence of these
techniques being used in practice.  It seems likely that they are too
difficult to decently implement in software, given the complicated
signature that they create.

Has anyone seen an implementation of these anywhere?

I am looking for simple algorithm that will encrypt ascii text to 
ascii text.  Essentially what I need is something like the unix crypt
routines that take your ascii password and create an encoded ascii 
string for in the password file.  It does not have to be unbreakable,
just simple and result in an ascii string.  

Any suggestions?

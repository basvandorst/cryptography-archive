The late 1960s was the time of Nixon and his abuse of wiretapping.

Does this quote imply that in spite of the public outcry against
Nixon's abuses, they are continuing today?  ...and that other governments

This certainly sounds ominous to me...

We should be able to deduce computer power (or algorithm weakness) from
this statement.  Anyone know A5 and A5X well enough to do that analysis?

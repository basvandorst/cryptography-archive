I really think that the elderly gentlemen who fought the 
cryptographic cold war in Stalinist and the early post-
Stalinist era should be brought out of their Florida rest 
homes and back to NSA headquarters.  Using a combination 
of the old, old cryptographic approaches and plaintext 
encryption,  you can create a time-warp-like effect that will 
spoof the various adversaries of the U.S. into thinking that 
the computers broke down, and we re all back to pencil and 
paper.  Besides, it ll make the old boys smile!

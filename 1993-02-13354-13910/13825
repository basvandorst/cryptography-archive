Maybe not. Isn't it possible the conversation in the room modulates
the 150khz tone via something in the ringer circuit, which is always
connected to the line, and it can be demodulated at the other end? After
all, we've read claims that you can shine a laser beam on a window pane and
read the conversation in the room off the reflected signal, and no special
window pane is required. In fact, according to a recent book, a special
window treatment is required to prevent this.

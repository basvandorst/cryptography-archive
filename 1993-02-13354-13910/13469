All the more reason for more people to start using the anonymous services.
It's like encryption.  As Philip Zimmermann says in the PGP documentation,
if only a few people use encryption those messages really stand out.
Naturally, intelligence agencies may choose to focus their efforts on
those few people who appear to have "something to hide".  The mere use
of encryption will be incriminating.

But if people used encryption routinely - PGP, PEM, or RIPEM - the mere
fact that a message was encrypted would be meaningless.  Everyone's privacy
would be enhanced.  As David Sternlight writes in his .sig, think of
encryption as an envelope for your email.

By this analogy, posting or mailing non-anonymously is like letting everyone
inspect the outside of every envelope you send or receive.  Why should
they find out who you choose to correspond with, what companies you choose
to order from?  Anonymous email defeats traffic analysis and provides
another "layer" of privacy.  Postal mail is basically anonymous, and our
civilization has survived somehow.  People should stop being so threatened
by anonymous posts.

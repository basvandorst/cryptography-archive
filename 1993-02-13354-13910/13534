I am interested in writing a program for the Macintosh that can create
"security envelopes" for data that, once decoded, can easily detect
tampering or curruption.  This is similar to the -! option in PKZIP,
which shows -AV when the file is unzipped.

What is the best way of going about this?

Another thing:  Should I issue signatures (like PKWare) and keep a central
registry of all signature data?

PS:  The encoding part is going to be either shareware or commercial, and
the decoding part will be free, but under copyright by me.

All encoding does is dump everything into a file, add a signature and
encrypted  sig data.  This allows you to manually extract the file if worse
comes to worst by ripping off the footer and the header.

Thanks in advance,

Does anyone know if the AsiaCrypt '91 Proceedings are going to be published
by anyone.  I assumed that Springer-Verlag would publish them in their
Lecture Notes in Computer Science series (like every other crypto conference
proceeding since 1984), but according to the PR person there, the book isn't
on any of their lists.

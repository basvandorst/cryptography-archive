	For historical reasons the Enigma is a very interesting cipher, and one
would expect that all details of its working should be widely known. I have tried
to get information on the excact wiring an operation of the rotors in order to
make a working software emulation of the famous Enigma. But I haven't found any
information about this. If anyone could point me to sources describing the
permutations, it would be most appreciated.

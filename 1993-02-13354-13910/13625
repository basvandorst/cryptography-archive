There was a posting in comp.compression a while back which indicated that
somebody (the poster) had broken the encryption of both the latest ARJ (2.39b)
and PKZIP (2.04c at the time).  This person said it was quite easy and that
he had contacted Robert K. Jung (ARJ author) wrt the crack.

The reply was that the encryption on ARJ was not designed to be incredibly
secure, but more of a deterrent. (as documented)

I have not seen a ARJcrack program, and the poster who claimed to have
broken it mentioned something about not making one.

I would suggest contacting Robert K. Jung:  robjung@world.std.com

Good Luck!

A similar program does exist - I have it, and have used it, and it
works as advertised.  The program I saw for PKZIP 1.1 used a brute-force
method.  The new program just spews out 2 serial numbers given a "company"
name.  Much more elegant...

So the authentication code for PKZIP2.04whatever HAS been broken.

For what its worth...

Actually, they begin with the line
	-----BEGIN PRIVACY-ENHANCED MESSAGE-----
as specified in the RFCs.  However, it is certainly true that the
concept of a signed non-encoded message does mean that it's possible
that the message will be munged in transport and its signature thus
invalidated.  Initial versions of the PEM RFCs did not include the
type MIC-CLEAR for precisely this reason, but it was eventually
decided that the ability of people without PEM-compliant readers to
view the contents was more important than the risk of transport
damage.  Both PGP and PEM also support a mechanism whereby the content
of the message is encoded to prevent munging.

Yup, both of those are borrowed from PEM (actually the "- " convention
comes from RFC 934.)

Sure it does.  It doesn't yet include a few things, like certificates
(but then again, almost nobody has certificates yet anyway.)  Their
addition is planned.

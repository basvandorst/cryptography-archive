Almost, but not quite.  The problem is that there is not an N log(N) bound
on sorting values from a restricted domain.  You can easily sort the
numbers 1..52 in 52 steps (involving no comparisons at all).

The latter of the two posted random permutation algorithms was correct.
It generated a perfectly random permutation from 51 random integers.

On the other hand, information theory will tell you this:  you need at
least log(N!) (or approximately N*log(N)) random *bits* in order to 
generate a random permutation.  Since the algorithm uses N numbers, each
of approximately log(N) bits, it certainly doesn't violate this...

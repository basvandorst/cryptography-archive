   Also the power modulus is written into int libraries if one could still be

Doubt if this would help.  Gauss's "Disquisitiones Arithmeticae"
published in 1804 describes modular exponentiation as an important
operation.  You need to find prior application of modular exponentiation
to cryptography.

PEM is about as standard as the ISO protocols -- meaning that no one
has ever seen an implementation of this "standard". PGP exists and
runs. I'd say that, in a de facto sense, PGP is far more standard than
PEM, at least in so far as there are thousands of people I can send
PGP mail to, and no one I can send PEM mail to.

Standards are not just what get published in RFCs, you know -- they
are what people use.

This is not to say that good ideas can't be taken from PEM, but I'm
not sure what being halfway PEM compliant would buy anyone.

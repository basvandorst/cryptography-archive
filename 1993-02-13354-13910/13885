	[encryption with lattice gas simulation]

    Does anybody know of anything similar ? I heard something about
    cryptographic applications of cellular automata, which should be
    similar, but I have never seen anything concrete.

I know of someone generating random numbers by simulating the
motion of gas molecules in a box.  I don't know the details or
whether he published anything but he claimed the results were
very random though the generator was very slow.  This was in
the early 80's.

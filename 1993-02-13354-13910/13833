You could achieve most of the same effect by interposing a smart
key-crunch routine before the DES-based encryptor.  I'll talk of
English, since I know the numbers a bit better, but the same applies to
most other languages.

If all 26 lower-case letters are equally probable, you get ~4.7 bits
per letter, or ~12 letters per DES key.  Given letter frequencies,
though, there are only about 3.5 bits/character, or 16 letters per
key.  Unless you expect people to pick passwords more than 16
characters long -- and I don't; most people don't type well enough to
log in if they do -- resorting to a double-length key isn't necessary.
DES's 56 bits are more than sufficient.

What's mandatory, though, is to do something smarter than to shovel
the typed characters into the key, a byte at a time.

Hi.  I'm wondering if anybody is aware of any examples of neural networks
being used for any kind of cryptography-related purpose.  If anybody is,
I'd be very thankful for references or pointers.

As I'm not a regular reader of either of these groups, email is preferable.
I'll scan for posts, however.  I'm also glad to summarize upon request--
assuming there's something to summarize, of course.


Thanks.

For me the best implementation on the net is available under the name :
UFC : Ultra Fast Crypt by ALEC MUFFETT
This implementation in well known by crackers ( I hope you are not one of
them) because it can help to crack most of the time 500 % faster )
(*)
If you are only a good guy studying the algorithm, I think it will be hard
because this version is very   
optimized and the source is not very
self-explan.... (I forgot the end of that word )
In this case, you can try the excellent Computer Networks & Archtecture,
By Andrew TanenBaum, that has a chapter about it. (  it is a book )

you can find these sources via archie : 'archie UFC'
or try for exemple :

(by ftp ) ftp.denet.dk
(directory) /pub/gnu/glibc-1.05.crypt.tar.Z

Excuses for my 'accent' 'cause I'm a poor little french Student studying
Network Architecture and Security.

(*) But I will not explain it here because of some CERT's advisors looking around there
. (Instead it is well known by everyone)

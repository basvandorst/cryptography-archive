It would be better for PGP to support the PEM RFCs.  If it did so then it
would be trivial for MIME-compliant mail programs and newsreaders to use
the MIME-PEM standard when it is finally released (it is currently
available as an internet draft from your favorite RFC/internet-draft
server.)

I am not sure what is planned for the next release of PGP, but support for
the PEM standard is an absolute MUST.  If it does not support PEM in the
near future it will soon be discarded for programs that do as PEM usage
becomes more widespread.  Think whatever you want about the PEM standard,
but it is a real RFC defined internet standard and failure to support it
ASAP will be a bad move...

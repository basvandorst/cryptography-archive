Sure, the method described in Wired would only give you the cellular
phones inside the area your scanner would be receiving. Anyway, a legal
tap at the network operator's would give you "the large picture" that
would be much more useful. (Using your own scanner would be useful, however,
for Radio Direction Finding.)

That would probably be different from country to country. The network
operator would have that information for all customers that get itemized
bills anyway. (At least until the bills are issued.)

Well, GSM does address the problem of tracing phones the way it's described
in the above mentioned article in wired. The phone would be using a temporary
identity, not the real identity as the current cellular phones do.

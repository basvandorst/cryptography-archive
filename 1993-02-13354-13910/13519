 Unix crypt uses your password as the key and encrypts the null text
 using essentially DES. It dir=ffers in sticking in an extra permutation
 of the bits at one point, based on the salt- ie if the salt is null, it
 is exactly DES, if it's not it sticks in an extra permutation. Also it
 encrypts 25 times, not just once - ie it is essentially DES^25 on 0
 See Muffats crack suite for the source code for the crypt function.

:True, but I would hope that

:  1) They still have to show a warrant to request the tap.
:  2) There is a log of such activities.

I know how old you are, so I can't sigh "Ah, the naivity of youth..."

I'd say it was a near certainty that remote observation taps are either
not logged or not logged by anyone accountable.

I'd suggest that there is no reason at all to believe that the number
of illegal taps is proportional to the number of legal taps.

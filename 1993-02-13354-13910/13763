Hi!

Anyone out there know any details of the encryption used by Apricot's
kit?  We use a load of Apricot PCs at work, and people keep going on
about their "security" features.....  Their recent advert claims that
the security system provides "an impregnable barrier to viruses and
unauthorised access".  I think this is misleading, and probably
illegal.

I'll be writing to them to ask them to verify their claims, and will
post the response if any1's interested.

Any info appreciated,

Nik.

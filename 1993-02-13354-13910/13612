I don't think this is true. Cell phones are explicitly covered by the
ECPA. You're probably thinking of CORDLESS phones, which are indeed
tappable without a warrant.

What's the difference between an cell phone and a cordless phone?
Technically very little, except that the cell phone uses more power,
making it much easier to intercept at a distance. Politically, a great
deal - there's a powerful domestic cellular industry, but none for
cordless phones (which are generally made overseas.)

The "encryption" here consists of XORing each vocoder frame with a
160-bit "mask" that is fixed for the duration of the call. Yes, this
is the same toy encryption scheme that is continually reinvented by
every CS undergrad.

We have the NSA to thank for this wonderfully secure scheme.

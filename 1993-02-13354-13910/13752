As I was looking through the NBS validation triplets posted here earlier, I was  
wondering if anybody had any comments on DES's complementation property.  If  
you look at the following pairs of triplets, you will notice the following  
property: all three of the pairs are matched with their complements, when one  
would expect that the ciphertext pairs would NOT be complements.

key		 plaintext	  ciphertext

0000000000000000 0000000000000000 8CA64DE9C1B123A7
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF 7359B2163E4EDC58

0000000000000000 FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF 355550B2150E2451
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF 0000000000000000 CAAAAF4DEAF1DBAE

0123456789ABCDEF 0000000000000000 D5D44FF720683D0D
FEDCBA9876543210 FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF 2A2BB008DF97C2F2

It is my understanding that this property holds for ALL such pairs.  While such  
a property would be expected if the algorithm only involved XOR's and  
permutations, the S-boxes should destroy that property.  In fact, it is quite  
clear from a cursory inspection of the parity of the inputs and outputs of the  
S-boxes that this property does NOT hold as the data flows the boxes.  Quite  
curious that it reappears at the input and outputs of the algorithm as a whole.   
If there is some perfectly resonable reason for this, given the nature of the  
algorithm, I would like to hear it.  As far as the effect of this property on  
DES as a whole, it is clear that if nothing else it halves the potential  
complexity it.  While we would want each plaintext/key pair to be matched with  
a random ciphertext, DES clearly matches plaintext/key pairs up to cipertexts  
two at a time in a very transparent manner.  I wonder what other groups they  
are bundled up into that aren't as obvious.  Anyway, any comment would be  
appreciated.

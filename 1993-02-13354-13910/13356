Well, it's clearly *much* slower than IDEA, because IDEA running on a
massively underpowered 16MHz 386 runs at nearly double the speed of RSA
running on a wonderfully fast SparcStation ELC*.  If "general encryption"
means sending anything any larger than very small messages, RSA *is* too
slow and IDEA isn't.

Yes, but RSA becomes much harder to attack when you're encrypting so
little with it, especially if all you're encrypting is randomly
generated keys.  I believe there's a weakness in RSA which shows up if
you send the same message three times with three different keys; this
problem doesn't arise with PGP key management.  And IDEA becomes much
harder to attack when you only ever use each key once.

I think IDEA a very pretty cypher; I enjoyed reading the document on it
and thinking "Oh, that's a good idea".  I'm not anywhere near expert
enough to know whether it's secure, but a lot of people who both know
and care are trusting data to it.

This really provokes my curiosity; I have no idea why someone arguing
against hybrid cypher systems might want to remain anonymous.

* Ok, you might not consider the ELC fast.  I'm typing at one now and I
think they're wonderful...

	The header pretty much says it all. I have a variety of 
systems- macs, ibms, and even a Sun... (along with 6 Timex-Sinclairs
and a couple of Ataris... :). 

	Basically, what's I'm asking is, when I read the docs for
pgp, or some des encryption program, it'll say, "With this program,
it'll take you 256^256^256^256^.... years to crack with a 8088",
if I had so many years, and had a spare computer lying around to
run it, which program, and where do I find it, can I run to crack
the various encryption routines?

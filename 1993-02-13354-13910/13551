THere is a desire by the CDC to accurately count all AIDS cases.
However physicians are a little reluctant to report all their patients.
Is there some way to encrypt say a name/DOB/SSN  that would not
be reversible yet the keys would remain public for consistency checking.
that is eliminating double reporting.

I don't see it, but then again cryptography makes my brain hurt.

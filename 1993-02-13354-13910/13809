This issue comes into importance with the push by the FBI for legislation
that requires all digital phone switches to come with a vendor-furnished
back door for use by law-enforcement agencies.  Their argument is that
current (legal) wiretapping techniques won't work for packet-switched
digital data.

Opponents (notably CPSR) point out the potential for abuse -- both by law
enforcement agencies and by non-authorized entities.  (There is also the
side point: how can captured digital data be made to stand up in court
as the genuine speech stream?)  It would be mighty tempting indeed, in
a town where the chief of police knows the head of the local phone office,
for the police to just tap-in when they felt it was convenient -- because
convenient is what it would be.

What the exchange above offers is a possible compromise -- an indelible,
authenticated record of tapping activity.  If a warrant for it exists,
well, fine.  If not, it's illegal, and either the detectives can start
tracking down the intruders, or the lawyers can start chasing the detectives.

There must be, of course, some way of assuring the record is complete
and authentic.  And can be reviewed by a trusted third party (such as the
judge) or made public after X time has passed, to ensure compliance 
with the law.

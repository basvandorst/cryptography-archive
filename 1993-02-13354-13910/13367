Variations in style might defeat textual analysis. Not only can you have 
a third party draft the msg, in accordance with a general instruction, but
(usually) there will be marked differences in text that has been dictated and
that which has been entered directly by an author. Altogether a bit iffy?

My concern with the security ultimately afforded by anon remailers (accepting 
their integrity, for present purposes) lies other directions. No security is 
afforded my msg content unless encrypted by me. It is reasonable to assume 
that at least one, and possibly several, interested parties conduct routine 
traffic analysis of anon remailer sites. A one-off use of an anon remailer 
might not link me to the recipient, but a regular flow of traffic?

Assuming that an enabled third party has sufficient interest to monitor all
throughput at an anon remailer site and I encrypt my msg. Unless the anon 
remailer super encrypts my msg on the owtward leg, the recipient's tagged.  

As far as I can see, anon remailer service only guarantees my anonymity against
the recipient (and handlers/administrators on the down leg). Why should the 
recipient believe/take action on a whisper in the dark? The situation seems 
wide open to deception. If I sign the PGP encrypted message then my anonymity 
is compromised.

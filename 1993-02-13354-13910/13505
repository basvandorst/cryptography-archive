Guess it's time to have the FAQ posted again.  Trying to crack random
ciphertext in an unspecified system isn't particularly enlightening:
failure to crack it doesn't say anything about the strength of the system.
For a "real challenge", produce the algorithm and maybe somebody'll take
a shot at it.  Why be coy about the name of the encryption package?
Security through obscurity is a snare and a delusion.

There are a <lot> of encryption systems that are too difficult for us
amateurs to crack.  There are also a lot of them that aren't... and if you
follow the guidelines in the FAQ, maybe you'll find out which is which.

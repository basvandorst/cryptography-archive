The only parts of PEM that I see supporting are MIC-CLEAR and
MIC-ONLY.  Encrypted messages don't work the same, and changing PGP to
fit into the RFC is wrong, IMHO, no matter *what* people think.
Please remember that an RFC is a "Request For Comments", although for
some reason people today think that RFCs are standards written in
granite.

This is like asking Microsoft to add Multi-user, multi-port,
multi-process, secure memory, etc. to MS-DOS.  Its not in the design.
It wasn't DESIGNED to do it, therefore changing the program to fit a
new "requirement" will break things.  There are proper tools for
proper things.  In this case, UNIX would be more suited to the
application.

As such, PGP was designed in a manner that the PEM documents were not.
There was careful planning is the development of PGP -- PGP's first
motive was encryption.  PEM's first motive was signing.  You can't
neccessarily mix the two.

I've NEVER said that "PEM is bad".  What I said is that PGP had its
own design goals, and PEM had others, and they are not exactly the
same.  While we can make them somewhat compatible, there are design
considerations that have already been made that make the merging of
the two impossible without breaking usefulness.

My reason why PGP should not totally support the PEM RFCs? Because: 
 1) The PEM RFCs are only going to be used for the cryptographic
information, and I think that everything is going to be transfered in
MIME anyways, and disregard the PEM headers, etc.
 2) PGP was designed with different goals in mind than PEM.
 3) The PGP data structures are not yet equivalent nor compatible with
the PEM data structures, so the point is moot until this happens,
anyways.

As for PGP usage, I already have over 500 keys in my keyring, and I'm
getting new keys and new webs of trust every day.  I don't see people
stopping the usage of PGP because of some documents that people call a
standard.  There are plently of RFCs that are ignored! ;-)

Enjoy!

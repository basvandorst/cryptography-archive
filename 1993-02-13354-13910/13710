This is ``possible'' to do, but not really something I'd want to implement...

I assume what you mean is that you would mail in a key comp as well as a
public key?  This would pose a lot of problems...

If the key comp is unencrypted, anyone who snags this message can revoke 
your key, or prevent the server from getting this message at all.

If the key comp is encrypted, the server can't do a thing automatically.

Even if I did trust the server to make a good decision and only revoke
the right keys, and I trusted the admin of these servers totally, I don't
think I would ever use such a ``feature.''

And I don't trust the server nearly that far -- and I wrote the software.
I trust the admin, but I'd still rather just encrypt my key comp with some
secret key and pass this off to my friends whom I trust.

As a matter of fact, I think I'll do just that right now.

This large coffee table book was on sale in most U.S. bookstores a few years
ago. The price was quite high. It was a series of surrealistic drawings and
documents about a fantasy society of snake-like beings with their own
writing script.

It is very high on my list of books from the planet Fred, along with the
Necronomicon and a few other things.

Interesting, unsettling, eerie, a sharp left turn without signalling for
one's brain.

Well worth a look if one can find it--probably out of print and too
expensive for most libaries.

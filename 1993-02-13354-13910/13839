Whoops!!

The above post escaped from captivity while I was still sucking the end of my 
pencil :-{

The formula for making crime pay should (at this stage) read:

			        f(R-O)>=p(c)

Actually, I hope the relationship between risk and reward can be detailed 
rather better than this, but I shall have to think about it some more.
While my brain cells continue to die, would someone else care to try defining
it?

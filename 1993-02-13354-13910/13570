   Anyway, it's now been proven that DES is not a group.  There is still
   a variant on exhaustive search that works on double encryption, but it
   takes a lot of memory.  Most folks recommend triple encryption, with
   two keys, and the second step a decryption using the second key.  The
   first and third steps use the first key.

Martin Hellman recommended using 3 independent keys in his DES
talk at the recent RSA data security conference.

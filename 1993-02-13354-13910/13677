I sent an "index" request to the key server and got back a list of
people's names and key ID's.  I noticed that there are an awful lot
of keys whose lengths were almost, but not quite, a power of 2:
e.g., 510 bits, 1022 bits, 1026 bits, 1032 bits, etc.  Why do people
choose these lengths?  Is it an artifact of an old PGP version, or
what?  Lengths like 768, I could understand; but I would think
multiples of 32 would work best on most machines.

Just wondering

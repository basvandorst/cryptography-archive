           ^^^^^^^^^^^^----should be odd(Bitcount)

The idea is simply that f(X[n]) is a bitstream such that
                                                     d
f(X[n]) = f(X[n-c]) Xor f(X[n-d]), which has period 2 - 1.
Therefore X[n] must have a period at least as long.

I was just trying to generalize and tripped over my feet.

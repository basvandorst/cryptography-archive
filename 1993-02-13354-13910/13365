Hi.  I've got an application where I'd like to run DES (actually, DES
with CBC) a bit faster than I can with currently available C code.
The platform in question is a 68040 based NeXT.  I'd be interested in
finding a DES implementation for a 56000 DSP, in hope of getting
higher throughput and since I happen to have one sitting in the box,
not doing too much at the moment.

Also, can anyone provide pointers to DES VLSI?  I'd be interested in
part numbers, vendor, and really rough cost.  Calling Motorola or TI
and asking about DES hardware usually results in the question "Do you
have a part number?"  If I did, I'd be calling the distributer..

	I asked a similar question earlier: are there any
little programs or small utitilites that would analyze
a given cipher text and give me back index of coincidences
trigraph frequency distributions and the lack.  I recently
purchased the book Elementary Cryptanalysis by Abraham
Sinkov, and in the book a few programs like this are written
in brain dead basic. (Basic you would find on a Commodore 64)
	I could convert them to C myself... But I got enough
projects at the current moment, and I'm sure there's something
even more sophisticated out there..

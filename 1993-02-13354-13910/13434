Answering in reverse order:

	I believe that end-to-end digital encryption is possible on GSM. 

	No. In breach of UK Telecommunications Act 1984 unless equipment is 
BABT approved. There is every reason to think that BABT approval would be 
witheld from equipment providing high grade end-to-end encryption. 
Modification of equipment with an existing BABT approval renders that approval
null and void unless the modification has, in its own right, been approved.
This opinion is based on the current refusal of the UK DTI to licence any 
digital speech encryption device for use by the public for radio communications
(such a licence being a requisite to comply with the Wireless Telegraphy Acts.

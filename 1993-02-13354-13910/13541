I have been thinking about an encryption system which seems simple enough
to implement, but I can' think of what might be wrong with it...

Here's how it works (not that this is any great invention...) 

First, we know that any stream CORxxx [sorry] XORed with a random stream
is a random stream.  Second, we have pseudorandom number generators 
which have fairly long cycles, and if they're not long enough, we can
make them longer, by XORing 2 or more random number strams streams
together, as long as they don't have the same cycle, ixx right? (This
may be a time performance problem.) So, all we need do is build this 
random number generator which is really powerful, in terms of the
size of its cycle, then XOR it with the clear text, and voila! it is
encrypted.  I know that one of th xxx strengths of the prime number
schemes is that searching for the numbers involves searching
trial-and-error (possibly with heuristics added) adds upoxxx up
to a lot of work, if you want to break the encryption system. 
I'm not saying that this is a good system, but what is wrong with it?

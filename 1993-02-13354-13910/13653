Agreed, I'd really love to know just what encryption algorithm this is.

Agreed again. How about it, Mr. Davidson? I haven't seen any messages from
you since your posted challenge? Are you willing to at least name the
commercial program used to encrypt this message?

Well, I must be honest here and say that I've been busting my balls for the
better part of what, a week or more, and I've gotten blessedly nowhere. Or, I
could say also that I've gotten somewhere, but I just don't recognize where
the hell I am!

Most of my efforts have gone into assuming that the UUENCODE is NOT a
deception, but I have played with the UUENCODED message from time to time.
I'm a rat contemplating jumping this sinking ship.

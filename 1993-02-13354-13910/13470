I'm sorry that I continue to seem stupid to you.  Please correct me if I
am wrong, but it does not seem to me that RIPEM is compliant with the PEM
RFC's.  It does not support some of the PEM fields, and it has made up
some of its own and added them: Recipient-Name, Originator-Name, and
Originator-Key-Asymmetric.

Because of these changes, RIPEM messages cannot be read or created by
PEM software, and PEM messages cannot be read or created by RIPEM
software, as I understand it.

In the RIPEM manual, it says "RIPEM is not really compatible with PEM"
due to these differences.

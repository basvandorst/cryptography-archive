This was precisely my point.  The call is scrambled between cell-phone and
cellular provider, but sent unscrambled over land-line to a fixed phone (even
if the owner of the fixed phone had an A5(X) chip, there is no provision to
encrypt over land-lines).  Or, for a call between cell phones, the call is
passed *unscrambled* over land-lines between cells.  In either case, there
is *absolutely no need* for the security services to be able to break the
encryption as a clear version of the call is always available PROVIDED THEY
HAVE A WARRANT.

The article stated that it was necessary for surveillance operations against
the criminal underworld, drugs barons and foreign powers.  Do you honestly
think they are proposing that the French police should monitor British
criminals, and vice versa?  (OTOH, this would be another way of evading
statutory controls - "M'lud, we did not obtain this information by tapping
the defendant's cellphone - the French police gave us a transcript...")  

Then again, how feasible is it to monitor cellular calls in foreign
countries?  Inherent in cellular technology is the use of extremely low
powers and the re-use of frequencies in non-adjacent cells.  To monitor a
cellular call in one country from another country would, *in general*,
require high gain antennae with very good directional characteristics to
avoid swamping from intervening cells.  I honestly don't know how difficult
this would be, or how reliably it could be performed, but it is obviously a
damn sight easier if you're driving around within one cell of the subject
with a receiver and recording apparatus.  Even if it is possible to monitor
calls in another country, and that is the only purpose intended by the
governments involved, it is possible for the security services to use them
on their own nationals without supervision (and highly likely that they would
do so).

As for foreign powers using cellular phones for secure communications.  Well,
anyone with a geiger counter can generate a hard disc full of random numbers
for use as one-time pads - far more secure than A5, A5X, PGP, RSA, DES,
RIPEM or anything else.  OK, you don't have voice capability, but the
military is used to written orders.  And since the call passes unscrambled
over trans-national links, A5 would be of no use to agents reporting to their
home country. Besides, none of the countries contemplating the use of A5X
has any monopoly on cryptographic expertise, semiconductor design or
semiconductor fabrication - we'll see A5 (or something as secure) chips
eventually.  And all this presupposes that whilst we are clever enough to
tell our people not to use A5X phones for sensitive information, that our
enemies are so stupid that they never think to do so (and maybe that their
civil servants and military work from cars instead of offices).

The *only* legitimate concern I can see is that criminals might buy cell
phones, strip out the encryption chips and somehow use them over land-lines.
The answer to this is to make the key-exchange protocol *very* `one-sided'
(IYSWIM) so that a scrambled call *cannot* be set up between to `mobile' GSM
chips.

I'm sorry you think I'm that stupid.  Indeed, I see that a US court has
already ruled that no warrant is needed to tap cellular calls and that the
material *is* admissible in evidence because the parties concerned have no
reason to expect privacy.  But we're talking about an *encryption* system
here.  One which people will buy in the expectation that they will get
*privacy*.  Yes, cellular calls without encryption are still unsecure, but
anyone with any sense realises this fact (draw your own conclusions about the
Royal Family).

By adopting a *secure* encryption technique, we ensure that the security
services *have* to monitor land-lines (unless the call is of a nature that
they can wait months to break it), and to do so they *must obtain a
warrant* - a process that subjects them to governmental controls and
auditing.

Are you *really* happy that a warrant is required to tap your phone but
not your cellphone?  Many people are not, but accept it as a limitation of
the technology.  With A5 we can place the legal mechanisms for the tapping
of cellphones (almost) on a par with ordinary phones - do you really object
to this, or would you prefer it if the police and security forces could tap
your phone without a warrant?  Since you use PGP, I suspect the answer to
that question is `no'.

I maintain that the real reason the security services want to downgrade from
A5 to A5X is so that they can evade statutory controls and governmental
auditing of their activities wrt cellular phones.  If, like me, you are
worried about the implications of downgrading to A5X, write to your elected
representative.

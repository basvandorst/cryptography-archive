   When they tap the radio signal, they're not getting a full call.  The

   If they did a legal tap, they'd get the full call -- because the phone
   system doesn't shuttle calls around, the cellular provider has to.  In the
   wired system, there is a single point where the whole call can be heard.
   (There are several, I assume -- including the handset of the person on
   the other end of the call.)

well, I've heard second- and third-hand stories that some or all
cellular switching stations in the U.S. have some number of trunks
straight to the FBI to "carbon-copy" them on "interesting" calls,
presumably selected by cellular phone number, and that support for
this is built into the cellular switch hardware.

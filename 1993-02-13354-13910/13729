   Sounds good in theory but I have removed the invalid key from my
   servers at least twice a day for the past several days. Like Vesselin
   said, it's like a virus. Anybody that decides to send their entire
   public keyring to the server invariably has the bad key as part of
   their public keyring if they have done any trading of public keyrings.

Sounds like the server needs to remember revoked keys and not merge
them in again from newly submitted keyrings.

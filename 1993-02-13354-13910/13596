Western organizations are big, multiply valued organisms with a very slow
rate of changing. Why do you define 'power' as force to alter? Im my opinion
power is the force to exploit. Most big organisations (even settled dictator-
ships) prefer the status quo. (look at history)

undisprovable ??? I am not able to understand that word in context.

disagreement. why would the 'chiefs' not detetect this and take 
countermeasures ?

Interesting. Disagreement. Source ? References ? Examples ?
This sounds like a Dogma.

btw. this is not for sci.crypt, IMHO.

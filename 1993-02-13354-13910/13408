I think these would help a lot, in combination with the other ideas
mentioned by Graham - encryption at each step, along with padding of
messages to some standard size.

If someone sends, say, 5 dummy messages a day to a remailer, and
occasionally replaces one of those dummies with a real post, it won't
be possible to correlate messages coming from this user with postings
appearing on some newsgroup.  If dozens of remailers exist, with
perhaps hundreds of messages batched up, decrypted, scrambled, and
remailed at each step, then there will be 100-fold confusion at each
step in the chain of remailers.  If several steps are used, the degree
of confusion could become too high to be effectively broken, even for
an adversary who has total monitoring of the nets.

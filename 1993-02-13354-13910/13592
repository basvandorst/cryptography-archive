Munchhausen Paradigm Shifts are a pathological 
phenomena which can be induced in modern organizations, 
especially those that have a positivistic philosophy and 
Machiavellian internal politics.  The term  Munchhausen 
Paradigm Shift  refers to Karl Frederich Hieronymus von 
Munchhausen (1720-1797) a German hunter, soldier, and 
raconteur.  Organizations with a postivistic outlook have an 
unspoken view of what is good or bad, and power in the 
organization is defined as the ability to alter the unspoken 
view of what is good or bad within the organization.  An 
adversary will empathize with the current organization s 
members to determine the current paradigm.  Then, like 
von Munchhausen, the adversary will introduce positivistic 
data constructed of postivistically undisprovable  facts  
designed to alter the value judgements of the members of 
the organization possessing power.  Once these  facts  are 
ingested and the value judgements changed, a perceived 
threat to the organization will be introduced by the 
adversary to force the power elite in the organization to 
modify the organizational paradigm in a manner that suits 
the adversary.  The pathological nature of the Munchhausen 
Paradigm Shift occurs when the Adversary causes a change 
that dramatically and (considering the organizations 
interests vis a vis the adversary) destructively alters the 
fundamental philosophical outlook of the organization.  Just 
thought you d like to know this.

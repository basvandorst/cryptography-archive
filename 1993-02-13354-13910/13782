We may soon see a change to the U.S. export policies that many here will
welcome. Just now, at a meeting at Silicon Graphics in California with
President Clinton and Vice President Gore, Gore said in response to a
general export control question that [stuff about  some controls for nuclear
non-proliferation being needed] some controls need looking at. He gave the
example of software that can be bought off-the-shelf but can't be exported,
and called that "a little unrealistic". Gore also said they're going to do
something about the case where one has to apply for an export license each
time, each one gets approved, but it takes six months each time.

As those who read carefully know, though I am concerned about uses I think a
violation of either patent or munitions law, I would welcome changes that
would make pgp at least not a violation of U.S. import/export law. Then all
we need do in the U.S. is resolve the RSA patent issue, hopefully with RSA's
cooperation. At least the notion of a European version of Ripem would no
longer be in question, since both DES and RSA (in Europe) would no longer
raise questions about violation of U.S. law, and neither is patented in
Europe. That would make Ripem inter-communication for non-commerical use
possible with completely clean hands internationally, and might at least
advance the same for PGP.

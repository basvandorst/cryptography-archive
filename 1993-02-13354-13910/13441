Hello, everybody!

As maybe some of you have noticed, since some time I am clearsigning
the articles that I am posting to several newsgroups. Since now with
the availability of PGP there -is- a way to sign an electronic message
(and in the same way to authenticate it), I thought that it is a
matter of politeness to sign my messages.

Unfortunately, this seems to create some problems:

1) It increases the net.traffic.

2) Several sites automatically reject messages containing long
signatures, where a "signature" is considered anything below a line
that begins with two dashes.

3) When transfered to some other networks (e.g., FidoNet), messages
that contain lines beginning with several dashes tend to terribly
confuse the mailing software.

I understand that all this is not my fault, but is due to the fact
that:

1) Some software is badly designed (e.g., a "signature" should be
considered to be delimited by a line, containing -exactly- two
dashes).

2) PGP is not designed with the Internet standards in mind and does
not form messages with proper headers, but instead uses some
delimiters inside the message body.

Nevertheless, in order to avoid further confusion, and until a way to
use shorter signatures is designed, I will stop clearsigning my posts.
This will be the last clearsigned article posted by me, until a better
system is designed. If meanwhile somebody needs to check the
authenticity of some of my articles, please send them to me and I'll
sign them and send them back to you via private e-mail.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Regards,
Vesselin

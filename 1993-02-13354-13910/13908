Unless the itar.zip file referred to has been updated in the last month, what
is there is not the ITAR but a discussion draft of proposals to amend the ITAR.
Interesting though this is, it is effectively useless. A similar caveat
applies to another sizeable file offered in the same ftp site directory, 
orngbook.zip. I believe the Orange Book can be ftp'ed in toto from NIST but I and maybe others in this group would welcome information on an anon ftp site 
offering the ITAR.

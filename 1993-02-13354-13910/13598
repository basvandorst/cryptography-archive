   This works only if you take care to use a cryptograpically secure

Has anyone knowledgable ever claimed MD5 to be a secure RNG?
I thought it was supposed to only be a hash function.  It might
be non-random and still be only slightly less good a hash function
than if it were totally random.  Say bit 47 of MD5(x) is always 0,
for any x, but the other bits are random.  Now Md5 is not especially
weakened as a hash function, but encryption by xor'ing with md5 output
would give away some of your secret data.  Of course, the non-randomness
could be much more subtle.

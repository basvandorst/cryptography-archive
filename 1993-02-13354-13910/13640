Pardon my cynicism, but this strikes me as an extremely cheapskate way of
doing your R&D and Q/A testing.  How about offering a prize of the order
of <no. of people attempting> * <average hours spent> * <cost of good
cryptographer/hr> - say, at a rough guess, $50,000 ? - after all, that's
probably how much it would cost you to do the job yourself properly...

Your explanation isn't quite right.  It is possible for an attacker to
successfully answer the queries and pretend to be a legitimate prover
--- with a $y$ that {\em is} a quadratic residue --- and
``authenticate'' if the verifier's source of random bits is stuck at
$1$.  Since it is simple enough to be a homework problem, the proof is
left as an exercise for the reader.  1/2 :)

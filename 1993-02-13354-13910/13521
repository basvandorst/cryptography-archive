How about creating a user 'guestftp' with a public password and a shell that 
doesn't exist, add an entry to /etc/shells for the non-existant shell (so 
that ftp will run), and set up the access control on your file so that
'guestftp' can read it. This gives an account that can't be used to log in, but 
can be used to ftp from.

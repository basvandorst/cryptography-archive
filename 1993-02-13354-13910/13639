        I'm very curious about the data encryption standard that Norton's
uses.  I suppose DES is standardized, so this question will apply to any
and all software that uses it.  
        How secure are files protected with it?  Is there any way to
recover files whose password has been lost?  Can it be done but only with
the supercomputers at Langley?  Any and all info appreciated, esp.
references to good books or files on the net or off that can further
elucidate.
	I!m certain these are all FAQs, but the depth and breath of my ignorance
is, indeed, unmatched in this area (and other areas, I suppose).
	Any help or reference greatly appreciated.

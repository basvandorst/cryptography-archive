Let's be careful.  PEM is about to be introduced as a Proposed Standard.
The original PEM proposal was changed sufficiently to necessitate
reintroducing the revised version as a Proposed Standard.

It will be quite some time before PEM becomes a Draft Standard and then
finally adopted as an Internet Standard.

Nevertheless, I am a PEM fan.  I question the feasibility of PGP being
PEM compliant though...

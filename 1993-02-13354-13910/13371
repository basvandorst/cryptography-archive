I could send you plaintext and encrypted text of output from Robert Alonso's
Secure.C. This algorithm uses byte position in the infile XORed with the
instream (i.e. first byte XOR'd with first position (1) etc. when it is
encoded again with the similar program VAULT (which XOR's the positional
result with a password string) and passed thru Secure again, the first 16 or
so bytes are decoded but the rest is gibberish...

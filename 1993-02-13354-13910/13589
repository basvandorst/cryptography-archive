Since Ray Lau is modest and doesn't toot his own horn, I'm going to take the
liberty of doing it. He is remembered as the author of Stuffit for the Mac,
one of the earliest and best compression programs, now a widely used
standard in the form of Stuffit Deluxe. He made this major contribution to
the Mac community while still in high school.

He has quietly been working on a Mac version of Ripem with a good interface.
It has gone through a number of pre-beta stages and seems quite robust. Ray
has said in his latest communication that the current version, the first
"beta", may be shared with those who agree to honor the various license
agreements. Note that as a beta it may still contain bugs, which Ray would
be glad to hear about, and as version 0.7 it is implied that a version 1.0
will contain still more features, perhaps including enhancements to key
management.

The beta is available from Mark Riordan's Ripem site. Access details with
respect to that site have been posted here before, and include a direct
communication to Mark with agreement to the license, before one can get
download access. Since Ray is doing this as a "back-burner" project, and his
current job is student, at MIT, I suggest interested parties get the beta
from the Ripem site rather than loading Ray's mailbox.

Kudos to Ray for a fine piece of work.

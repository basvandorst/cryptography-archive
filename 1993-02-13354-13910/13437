Whats wrong with making the encryption function:

	ascii -> binary_encrypted -> ascii-armored encrypted_binary

and decryption:

	ascii_armor -> binary_encrypted -> ascii

This way you can put in whatever "encryption" you want, just so long
as the de/enecryption and de/armor functions are the same....

       Not to derail the direction of this thread, but this raises a
   question re. the ITAR talk earlier:  Does *ANY* piece of software
   using a 'key' greater than 40 bits in length come under jurisdiction
   (i.e., cannot be exported without approval) - even though it may be
   as lame as a 41 bit PRNG feeding an xor function?

      Conversely, is any system, no matter how sophisticated and well
   designed, exempt from control, provided the key is 40 bits or less?

From my conversation with an NSA (yes No Such Agency) representive
at the RSA data security conference last month:

1. *ALL* cryptography technically comes under jurisdiction of the
ITAR.  Since all the questions other people had asked tried to
determine the edge of how strong a cipher could be and still be
exportable, I asked whether there was a level of cryptography that was
*so bad* that they would say that they would say it was ok to export
without approval.  The rep said no, there was no such level, it was a
question of how the cryptography is used and it was very dangerous to
make any assumptions.  I then asked whether I would get in trouble for
exporting a news reading program with a "rot13" command built in, and
this question was sort of waved off.  My impression is that in
practice, they don't care about non-serious cryptography unless it is
going to be widely used but couldn't commit themselves to saying this;
however, I might be -very- wrong.

2. You need export approval for any kind of cryptography.  However,
certain specific methods, including RSA with keys <= 512 bits or
RC2 or RC4 with keys <= 40 bits, qualify for an expedited approval
process.  You still must apply for the approval but it is automatically
granted within 7 days unless there is something wrong with your application.
[Note: RC2 and RC4 are secret-key ciphers developed by RSA Labs].

3. The expedited approval does *NOT* apply to other algorithms,
whether or not the key length is <= 40 bits.  If you develop the Ray
Berry encryption algorithm with 32 bit keys and want to export it, you
must go through the longer approval process which involves registering
with the State Dept. as an international arms dealer (no joke).

Disclaimers: 1) I'm not a lawyer, don't take this as legal advice
	     2) As usual, I don't speak for Telebit
	     3) This info is from memory and it's possible that I
		garbled some details, but I think I have the basic
		facts correct.  See also the notes from the
		talk "Export Controls on Cryptographic Software",
		by Gerard Rainville of the NSA, in the Proceedings of
		the 25th Internet Engineering Task Force, November 1992,
		and the page 1 article "Breaking U.S. Encryption
		Statue Could Be Costly", in PC Week, Feb. 8th 1993.
		This explains the history of the ITAR etc. in some detail.
	     4) The crypto export situation is changing pretty rapidly
		and may become radically different under Clinton (more
		relaxed, one would hope).

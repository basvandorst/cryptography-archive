Rcrypt Challenge - Part I: The Flame-Fest

This purpose of this challenge is to see if our new encryption scheme
is as good as we think it is.  To this end, we are offering USD$500 to
the first person that can break it.  This challenge will run
approximately 3 months (until 15-May-1993).  We will supply all kinds
of information to anyone wishing to participate :)  The exact rules
follow.

1) First, here's what we are supplying:

   a) The majority of the plain text file that we have encrypted 
      (7001 bytes).
   b) 11 encryptions of that file using the SAME KEY.  The first 10 of
      these are the result of a hashed/padded encryption, and the last
      is the result of a pseudo one time pad.  Rcrypt performs both of
      these, based on the same PRNG.
   c) A working executable copy of Rcrypt for use with Sun Sparc-
      Stations, with a license that expires 3 months after the 
      challenge ends (15-August-1993).
   d) A listing of the source code to Rcrypt, minus the node locked
      licensing software.  Note that the node locked licensing
      software has NOTHING to do with the encryption method.  It's
      just our method of foiling lazy software pirates once we get
      things into production :>
   e) A manual page describing how to use Rcrypt.  This will be
      provided both in plain text format, and in the proper format for
      inclusion in the man files under SunOS 4.x.
   f) A GENERAL description of the PRNG and the encryption algorithms.
   g) Some statistics about the operation of rcrypt (speed, key size,
      etc.)

2) Second, here's how you can get everything mentioned above:

      All items are available via snail (US mail).  Please send your
      request to:

			  The Rcrypt Challenge
			  7110 Sawmill Village Dr.
			  Columbus, OH  43235

      Please include a self addressed return enveloped.  Also complete
      and include the form that appears at the end of these rules.
      Please make sure that you fill in the HOSTID space.  If you do
      not include the hostid, we will not be able to supply the
      executable.
      
      Items a,b,c,e,f, and g will be on an Sun formatted 3 1/2 inch
      diskette.  If you supply a 1/4" QIC150 tape ($3.00 return
      postage, please), we will gladly use that instead.  Other
      arrangements may be possible.  Item d will be on 8 1/2" x 11"
      paper.

      Note that we are using snail so that we can not accidentally
      violate any of the export laws that may (or may not :) apply.
      Therefore, we will only mail materials to non-PO box US
      addresses.  We reserve the right to refuse mailing materials to
      anyone at our discretion.

      Items a,b,e,f, and g will be available via e-mail.  Note that
      this does not include either the source code or the executable.
      Therefore, we will be willing to e-mail this material anywhere 
      on the internet.  Note that if demand becomes to great (OK, I'm
      being optimistic), we reserve the right to discontinue this
      e-mail service.

      Finally, we will post items a,b,e,f, and/or g if there is
      sufficent demand.

3) Third, here's what you have to do to get the USD$500 fee:

      Simply be the first person to identify the missing portion of
      the plain text file.  This portion occurs at the end.  The
      overall plain text consists of the Preamble of the Constitution
      of the United States and the first ten amendments to the
      Constitution of the United States, followed by 1000 lines
      consisting simply of the numbers from 1 to 1000 in ascii text,
      followed by a number of blank characters and/or lines, followed
      by a single paragraph of text from a commonly available (as in a
      library) source, followed by several lines footnoting the
      source.

      The file "partial.txt" (item a) contains everything but the
      final paragraph and footnote, and the blank spaces/lines
      preceding it.

      You must identify the plaintext via the footnote.  The first
      person to do this will receive the $500 fee.  The recipient of
      the fee is responsible for all applicable taxes.  Please send
      any successful identifications of the text via CERTIFIED MAIL
      to:

			  The Rcrypt Challenge
			  7110 Sawmill Village Dr.
			  Columbus, OH  43235
            
      Each person/organization is limited to 10 attempts.

4) The challenge will conclude upon receipt of the first valid
   response, or 01.00.00 GMT 15-May-1993, whichever comes first.

5) At the conclusion of the experiment, the actual key will be posted
   to sci.crypt, as will the missing plain text.  This will insure
   that all participants can verify the integrity of this challenge.

Obligatory Information (the fine print):
         
   This challenge represents the personal efforts of the general
   partners of Ciphergen Research.  Ciphergen Research, Rcrypt, and
   the Rcrypt Challenge are not related to or owned by the company
   from which this posting is made.

   Ciphergen Research reserves the option to alter the rules for this
   contest at any time.  Any alterations will be posted to the
   sci.crypt and alt.security Internet newsgroups.  [At present, the
   only rule change we forsee will occur if we get too many requests
   for materials (ie. several hundred).  In that case, we may request
   return postage included with the request for materials.]

   Rcrypt is protected by the copyright laws of the United States of

	   Request For Materials and License Agreement For
		     the Rcrypt Challenge: Part I


I, ____________________________________________________________ (name)

of _______________________________________________ (company, optional)
request materials for the Rcrypt Challenge: Part I.  The HOSTID of the

Sun SPARCstation I intend to run Rcrypt on is _______________________
(The hostid is required in order to recieve the executable.  If the
hostid is omitted, all other materials will be sent.)  In order to
recieve these materials, I agree to the following terms:

	   1) I will not decompile, reduce to human readable form,
	      copy, or redistribute the Rcrypt executable.

           2) I will not enter in to a computer, compile, copy, or
              redistribute the Rcrypt and Cipher source codes.

	   3) I will not attempt to produce a working license for the
              Rcrypt executable that has a different expiration date
              or a different hostid than the one provided as a part
              of the requested materials.

The only exceptions to these terms are copies of the executable and
license(s) made for backup purposes, and copies of the executable,
source code, and license(s) made for the Sun SPARCstations identified
by the following hostids:

	_________________________	_________________________

	_________________________	_________________________

	_________________________	_________________________

	_________________________	_________________________

	_________________________	_________________________


(The license file we provide will include licenses for all of the
listed hostids.  Simply copy this file into into the appropriate
directory for each Sun.  Upon execution, Rcrypt will search the
license file for the appropriate entry.)

Note that all materials besides the executable, source codes, and
license(s) are not restricted by this license agreement.

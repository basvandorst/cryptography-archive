	Acording to the Sunday Times (31 Jan) the whole GSM standard has
	been changed to specify A5X encryption, which is less difficult
	to crack.  This is in response to GCHQ etc not being able to snoop.
	The GSM manufacturers must be really pleased !  All those chips to
	throw away and re-design.

Note this is only a change necessitated by these systems now being sold
abroad.  These weaker systems have never been mandated in Britain.
Strong evidence, as if we needed it, that cellular calls in the UK 
are all easily listened to by remote observation when they go through
the conventional part of the BT network.

(The fact of uk remote observation incidentally was dropped on uk.telecom
last week by an idjit who thought that because he somehow managed to
avoid signing the official secrets act, thinks he's not bound by it...)

There are programs to correct spelling and grammar.  There are other programs
which analyze documents for conformance to a particular institutional style.

So, these must be used in any attempt to be anonymous.  We merely need
define a properly "anonymous style", publicize the specs for the style,
and keep testing/refining it.

Of course, anonymous posters will be _very grey_ personalities when all this
is done.

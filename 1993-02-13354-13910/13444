Uhh, a couple of things.  

1) software shouldn't modify a message, whether it contains a
signature or not (nor whether the signature is plain-text or a
crypto-sig).

2) PGP may not have been designed with the Internet in mind, but PEM
was, and the PEM headers are extremely similar to PGP headers... PEM,
as defined by the new 1113 et.al RFCs define the headers to be:
-----{BEGIN,END} PRIVACY ENHANCED MESSAGE-----

Any ways, if PGP mail is failing because of brain-damaged software,
then I don't see how PEM is supposed to work, either!  Vesselin, my
suggestion to you is to CONTINUE putting your signatures on your
messages.  If I had a better emacs interface (I read mail and news
within emacs) to PGP, I would clear-sign my messages, too.

Please, don't let poorly written gateways detract from the usefulness
of cryptographic authenticity!

I really posted it to those two newsgroups; maybe some of you have
seen it. However, the problem is that with the wide and semi-automatic
distribution of public keys, a key is like a virus; you just cannot
get rid of it... Even if you delete it from your collection (which I
did), you'll keep receiving it as an "update" from other places and
people who have not deleted it. It is enough that a copy of the key
"survives" in one collection, and it will quickly "infect" the
collections again, if you are not paying attention...

Maybe it should be a good idea to implement something like "kill
files" for PGP - e.g. files that describe public keys you don't want
to be added in your public keyring.

I hereby certify with my signature that what John writes is true.

I sent it to you by private e-mail (for the second time!), didn't you
receive it?!

I am using the user ID "jpunix"; it's easier to remember than the
above key ID.

Someone montioned here some while ago the HPACK compression
utility.  I got it from nic.funet.fi /pub/crypt/hpack and would
like to know if any of you has used it for some time.

How does its compression rate compare to other utilities ?
How old is it ?
Has it been accepted by the public? (i.e. Is it's use growing?)
What are the advantages HPACK has over other compression utilities?

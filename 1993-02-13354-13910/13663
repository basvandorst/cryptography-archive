Not quite.  Hill is still a block cipher.  The block might be large
but it isn't the whole message.  I did a Hill cipher on 40-character
blocks many years ago.  I wouldn't go much larger, for performance
reasons.

If you want to do that, all you have to do is transpose bytes.

cf. tran, posted here a while ago (and avbl from me by e-mail) which
transposes an 8K block of bytes.

	des | tran | des

provides more mixing than Hill would (unless you had an 8K Hill matrix, but
I doubt you could put up with the computation load).

Back to my soapbox, my preference is really:

	compress | des | tran | des | tran | des

It might also help to add some (4?) truly random bytes to the head of the
output of each of the first two DES invocations in the line above, but I
don't have such a program at the moment.

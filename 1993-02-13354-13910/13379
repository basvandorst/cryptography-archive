Along the same lines is a RNG called r250, described by Kirkpatrick and
Stoll in the Journal of Computational Physics (vol 40, 1981). There was an
article on it in the May 1991 issue of Dr. Dobbs.  R250 only requires a
single XOR and some array housekeeping for each number generated.  Its main
advantage outside of simplicity is that it has an extremely long period (2
^ 249).  I have no idea how good it's statistical characteristics are: The
arguments in the K & S article were not entirely convincing.  Does anyone
else have any information on this?

The the N'th (integer) term is generated by the following relation:

   X[N] = X[N-103] XOR X[N-250]

Some care has to be taken when generating the initial 250 starter values to
guarentee maximum period and pseudo-random behavior.

This latter "hope" is destined to be disappointed.  Existing cellular
phone systems track the location of mobile terminals *all* the time,
and future systems will probably do the same.

The reason for this is that if someone calls a mobile terminal, the
cellular system has to know where to send the call to.  In particular,
it has to know what cell the mobile terminal is in.  There are really
only two design options:
1.	Have every cell send out a query for the desired number
	when some calls.
2.	Have every cell continuously track the location of all
	turned-on mobile terminals within range.
So far as I know, all present and proposed systems use #2.

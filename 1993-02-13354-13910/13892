This is actually work by Haber and Stornetta, at Bellcore, not Bell
Labs.  I won't try to describe it all; bascially, hash functions of the
documents to be timestamped are hashed together with a seed value.
This seed is taken from the hash values of some documents submitted
just prior to the new ones.  Similarly, the output hash values are
carried forward to the next bach.

The result is that each group of documents is linked, forward and
backward, into an unforgeable chain (under the standard assumption that
our hash functions are secure, of course).  That anchors things in
relative sequence; if there are sufficient number of independent
organizations using the timestamp service, their testimony would
probably suffice.  To tie things down even more, Bellcore publishes an
output hash value in the N.Y. Times at regular intervals -- weekly, I
think.  This is a very public number, of course, and couldn't exist
before the week's papers were processed.

Full details are in their paper ``How to Time-Stamp a Digital
Document'', in CRYPTO '90 and the Journal of Cryptology, V3, n2, 1991.

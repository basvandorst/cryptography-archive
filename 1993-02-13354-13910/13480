	Would someone explain to me how this argument makes any sense when 
	military traffic is excluded?  I think the real reason is
	to prevent internal  groups from using encryption to
	allow revolutionary communications.  All governments can agree
	that this is bad from a government perspective (almost by definition)
	but governments have always loved wars.  They are so useful for
	rallying the proles around the flag and focusing their attention
	on foreign enemies to take the heat off their domestic enemies in
	their own government.  Worked for George and Saddam, it can work for
	you. ;-)

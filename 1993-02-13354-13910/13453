I've seen this misconception in several places.  Actually, the PGP
cleartext signatures have many similarities to the specification in the
Internet standard RFC 1113, which describes Privacy Enhanced Mail
(PEM).  PEM messages start with -----BEGIN PEM MESSAGE----- according
to that RFC.  They will presumably be just as vulnerable to the
problems that Vesselin mentions.  The use of five dashes to start a
line comes directly from this RFC.

The Ascii encoding used in PGP non-cleartext messages also comes from this
RFC.  So does the behavior of quoting all lines which start with "-" by
adding a preceding "- " to them, another behavior which people have called
objectionable.

PGP obviously does not try to be compliant with the PEM RFC's; even
RIPEM doesn't try that.  But it has apparently adopted some of the
ideas expressed there.  People who are unhappy about these provisions
are objecting several years too late.

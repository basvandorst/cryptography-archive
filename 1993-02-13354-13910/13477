Twice in the past six weeks, source code has been posted
to Usenet which performs the encoding and decoding:

   (channel_number, date, starting_time, length) <---> (VCRplus_code_number)

Both times the posts were to rec.video with crossposts to
alt.sources.  Your favorite site that archives Usenet should
have it ... just look at the articles from 1993, of which
there are not all that many, and voila you have it.

One of the programs was in C and the other was in Fortran.
The C version was complete, the Fortran version required you
to figure out part of the VCRplus decoding algorithm,
a 200-entry "confusion" table (author was scared of lawsuits
from VCRplus Inc), by punching buttons on your VCR Plus
controller unit for twenty minutes.

Although I never tried it to see if the path actually worked,
I did write down one reputed ftp site:

   black.ox.ac.uk  (127.67.1.165)  /src/vcr+.shar.Z

Supposedly this is the C version, but as I haven't personally
verified it, you should treat the information as "a rumour"
not as "a fact".

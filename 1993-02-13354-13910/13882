I was that "another responder".  My original explanation was meant to be
a terse hint, but it seems that sometimes you can be too terse.  My goal
was to give a simple reason why the protocol fails, without (explicitly)
involving any attack.

True, proof of knowledge is different from proof of validity.  But here,
we are dealing with proof of knowledge of a witness for an NP statement.
Any convincing proof of knowledge of a witness is automatically a
convincing proof of the validity of the NP statement.  As I explained,
the protocol fails to be a proof of validity if b is always 1, it follows
that it cannot be a proof of knowledge (of witness) either.
